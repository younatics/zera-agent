"(CNN)  -- The volcanic eruption in Iceland is having an adverse impact on international sport with next weekend's Japanese MotoGP the latest casualty. The Motegi race circuit near Tokyo was supposed to host the likes of Valentino Rossi and Casey Stoner for the second round of this year's championship, but with flights from Europe severely restricted, organizers took the decision to postpone the race. It will now be held on October 3, between the 14th and 15th rounds in Spain and Malaysia. ""Although the situation is beyond our control, we sincerely apologize to fans who have been eagerly waiting for the world's top-level race,"" said Hiroshi Oshima, president of the race operators. MotoGP is not the only motorsport event affected, with Formula One teams, who took part last weekend's grand prix in Shanghai, struggling to get back to their European bases. It has led to fears that the fifth round in Barcelona on May 9 could be called off because there would be inadequate time to freight back the cars and get them ready to race. But F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone has dismissed fears that it was under threat. ""No. Not at all. There are no problems with the race,"" he told gathered reporters in Shanghai. But other more immediate sporting fixtures have been thrown into chaos, with European champions Barcelona forced to make a near 1,000 km coach journey to play the first leg of their Champions League semifinal against Inter in Milan on Tuesday. Barca's technical director Txiki Begiristain told the club's Web site that they were unhappy with the travel situation, which he claimed put them at a disadvantage. ""UEFA must be flexible,"" he said. ""I know that there aren't enough dates to play but in the end you have to make an effort so as not to give one team an advantage, in this case the home team. ""At this moment in time, making a team travel by coach belongs to a bygone age."" he added. English clubs Liverpool and Fulham are also struggling to get to Europa League semifinal ties on Thursday in Madrid and Hamburg respectively after UEFA said both would go ahead. Fulham confirmed on its club Web site that their match in Germany remains unchanged, while Liverpool told CNN they are arranging alternative travel plans for their tie against Atletico Madrid. Organizers of Sunday's London marathon have also been left with a headache to make sure their field of elite runners can get to the British capital in time, while Monday's Boston marathon, the oldest on the calendar, has also been hard-hit with competitors from around the world unable to get to the United States. Moroccan Olympian Abdellah Falil has been forced out of the elite men's race because of the travel restrictions. England's cricketers may also have to put their travel plans on hold as they prepare to fly out to the Caribbean for the Twenty20 World Cup. The crisis came about after a vast cloud of ash spewed from Iceland's Eyjafjoell volcano since last Wednesday. It has forced airlines to cancel flights across most of Europe, leaving millions of passengers stranded around the globe.","Travel disruption from volcanic ash eruption in Iceland disrupting sport .

"(CNN) -- Australian David Saker has been appointed England fast bowling coach, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Thursday. Saker takes over from Ottis Gibson, who took the job of head coach with the West Indies back in February. The 43-year-old spent six years as assistant coach with Australian state side Victoria, helping them to the Australian state championship twice, and four Twenty20 titles. He was head coach of the Delhi Daredevils in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, and an assistant coach during the franchise's first two Indian Premier League tournaments. Saker played first-class cricket for both Victoria and Tasmania in his ten-year domestic career and is expected to begin his new role before the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 tournament in the Caribbean later in April. He told the ECB's official Web site: ""I believe I can offer the England bowlers a great deal and oversee their development at the highest level. I'm looking forward to working with the impressive crop of bowlers currently in and around the England team."" England team director Andy Flower said: ""His [Saker's] record with Victoria in recent times is second to none and he has managed the development of a number of top-class fast bowlers.

"LaGrange, Illinois (CNN) -- Kaley Shannon first saw the devastation in Haiti while watching the 5 o'clock news with her father. Seeing so many people in need after the January 12 earthquake, the determined girl from the Chicago suburbs wanted to help. ""When I saw those pictures, I realized those kids in Haiti didn't have a future unless someone would help them,"" said Shannon, 14. ""I knew I had to be that someone."" Shannon, who is active in her school's theater, says she got some inspiration from Hollywood. ""Brad Pitt builds houses in New Orleans, Angelina Jolie adopts kids from other countries -- that selflessness inspires me. I wanted to give people hope like they do,"" she said. Her goal was to raise $90,000 by this week, which marks 90 days since the earthquake. But to do that, she had to act quickly. She immediately called her friends at her church youth group, who were eager to help. They started brainstorming. ""We had ideas coming out in every direction,"" she said. With Valentine's Day approaching, the group decided to bake heart-shaped cookies and sell them to make money for the quake survivors. They also settled on a name for their group: Student Hearts for Haiti. ""I'm not the best baker in the world, but we were determined,"" Shannon said. With the help of their church's industrial-sized oven, the teens baked 2,000 cookies, selling them to people heading to and from the train stations in the Chicago suburb of LaGrange. ""I'm absolutely not a morning person, and it was freezing, but we knew our mission was urgent,"" Shannon said. The cookies were a huge hit. Commuters gobbled them up. Even people trying to stick to a diet would drop in their change. By the end of the first day, Student Hearts for Haiti had made $3,200. They sold the remaining cookies at Shannon's father's office in downtown Chicago. There, a UPS delivery man decided to buy 10 bags of cookies. He told Shannon he was from Haiti. His mother still lived there, running an orphanage that was badly damaged. ""He gave me the biggest bear hug and told me how proud he was that I was helping,"" Shannon said. ""That gave me an idea."" The group sent the donations from the cookie sales to the Red Cross and Mercy Corps for immediate relief. But if her kid-run organization wanted to continue, Shannon thought, it should provide a way for kids in the Chicago area to directly help the kids in Haiti. ""I thought after we all saw what we did on TV, other kids in my area would want to help,"" she said. ""Student Hearts for Haiti could give them the tools to do that."" So with her father's help, Shannon set up a Facebook page and started calling local schools. They also partnered with Free the Children, based in Toronto, Ontario, to rebuild a school in Haiti. Other fundraising ideas came pouring through the Facebook page: A boy whose father ran a wristband factory donated ""Hearts for Haiti"" wristbands. Shannon's high school, Lyons Township, donated the proceeds from its King of Hearts dance. Another boy turned his 15th birthday party into a fundraiser. Local merchants in LaGrange and Western Springs put out donations buckets, and so did many of Shannon's teachers. And 12 local schools started their own efforts. One of those schools was Mary Grace Chizewski's. Chizewski, 12, had also been affected by the images of suffering in Haiti. Shortly after the quake, she had reached out to her friends at St. Francis Xavier, and they approached the school's principal to ask if they could help. ""These kids in Haiti had lost everything. I thought, 'How are they going to succeed in life if they don't have a school?' "" Chizewski said. ""We hear all the time at our own school that we should help others when they are in need -- I thought here's our chance."" While sympathetic, the principal told them the school was already committed to several service projects. She wasn't sure if there'd be time. But a couple of days later, the principal got a call from Shannon's father, who convinced her to help Student Hearts for Haiti. ""I was so excited when the principal called to ask if I was still interested in helping raise money for Haiti,"" Chizewski said. Shannon's father gave the St. Francis Xavier students T-shirts and wristbands, and Chizewski and her friends spent the next recess planning how to sell the donated items. They put posters up on every floor and used the morning announcements to ask students to help. The group kept a big heart poster in the main office to track their progress. They'd color in a little more each time they'd raise $500. When the heart was full, the principal let the whole school know with an announcement on the PA system. On the school's dress-down day, students wore their Hearts for Haiti T-shirts and wristbands. ""It was so cool to see all those kids in the halls wearing our T-shirts,"" Chizewski said. ""I'd never done anything like this before."" In the end, the 672-student school generated more than $5,500. That amount was doubled when Student Hearts for Haiti got a matching grant, which meant that St. Francis Xavier's effort was enough to build and furnish one classroom in Haiti. With the matching grant from the Moyer Foundation, which was founded by Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer and his wife, Karen, the group has raised more than $80,000 so far. Shannon says she still hopes to reach her goal of $90,000, and after that, she has no plans to stop there. ""I want to rebuild as many schools as we can,"" Shannon said. ""We've had rival schools helping; we've had kids from the public schools and the Catholic schools, kids who don't normally talk to each other working together on this. ""I think this has helped kids realize it feels good to be a part of something bigger than just you.""","Kaley Shannon wanted to do more for Haiti than send donations from a cookie sale .

"CNN -- Manchester City announced a deal to sign Spain international David Silva from Valencia on Tuesday as the big-spending English club continued preparations for success in the Premier League next season. Coach Roberto Mancini has already lined up the signing of Hamburg's Germany defender Jerome Boateng, which will be completed on Thursday, while Barcelona's Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure is also poised to move to City. Silva is expected to sign a four-year contract once he returns from the World Cup in South Africa. Spanish media reports claim the deal to bring the attacking midfielder to the City of Manchester Stadium is worth around €32 million ($39.1 million). ""The player's advisors and officials from both clubs have finalized the details over a four-year contract,"" City said in a statement. Mancini is a big fan of Silva and expects the 24-year-old to be an important player in the club's charge for honors next season. ""I am so pleased he is coming to us, I think he can make a big, big impact for Manchester City,"" the Italian told the club's official website. ""In signing David, we are showing the world that we are bringing the best players here and that we hope to compete to win the Premier League. ""When players see what is happening at Manchester City and the ambition they are attracted to what we are building and want to be a part of it."" Silva came through Valencia's youth system, helping the club win the Spanish Cup in 2008 following successful loan spells with Spanish sides Eibar and Celta Vigo. He has played 37 games for Spain and scored seven times since making his international debut in November 2006 against Romania, and was a key figure in the team that won Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Barcelona sign striker Villa . Cash-strapped Valencia had little choice but to sell another star player due to club debts in excess of €500 million ($612.3 million). Striker David Villa, who has so far netted four goals in four games at this year's World Cup, was sold to rivals Barcelona in May for a reported fee of €40 million ($48.9 million). Speaking about the move, Silva thanked his former club for its support and also announced he is looking forward to playing in the Premier League. ""Firstly I would like to thank Valencia as a club and all of their loyal fans, and my teammates there and staff,"" he told City's official website. Villa strike sends Spain into last eight . ""I have enjoyed six years at Valencia, they discovered me as a footballer and they will always be a special club for me. The time is right for me to seek a new challenge, and I am thrilled about playing in England with Manchester City. ""I believe the Premier League is one of the best competitions in the world and I want to bring success to City and win trophies for them."" Manchester City, bought by an oil-rich Abu Dhabi consortium in 2008, failed to secure a Champions League place last season after finishing fifth in the league despite spending more than £100 million ($122.4 million) on new players. More big names are expected to follow Silva to City in pre-season as the club seeks its first Premier League title in 2010-11.","Manchester City announce deal to sign Spain international David Silva from Valencia .

"(CNN) -- A coalition of Iranian reformist groups is urging opponents of the regime to stage non-violent protests on the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution next week. The Council for Coordinating the Reforms Front called Thursday for people to march ""with their green colors"" in support of the opposition Green Movement on February 11. Such protests represent a show of force for citizens who oppose the government's stiff crackdown on people who demonstrated against the June election victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a vote regarded as fraudulent by many. ""We will show all of the small-minded people who sit on the thrones as rulers, and label any opposition as tools of foreign enemies, the fate of single-voiced [autocratic] systems and establishments,"" the council said in a written statement. The statement was issued after opposition leaders such as Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi called for non-violent protests, to make reformists' ""voices heard to comrade and competitor"" and ""friend and foe."" Full Iran coverage . ""We come to scream on behalf of the political prisoners, most of whom were present in the 1357 revolution [1979] and tell them [the authorities] that in lieu of imprisonments and violence against the people, you must return to the fundamentals and the original values,"" the statement said, making reference to the years in the Islamic calendar. ""We will tell them to respect the laws and instead of voicing unfounded and fabricated concerns about [foreign] plots, to be more in tune with analyzing their own actions. We will tell them that the mirror shows an accurate reflection of who you are and if you break that mirror, you only break yourself."" Among the groups in the coalition are the Participation Party of Islamic Iran, the Organization of the Mujahedeen of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, the Association of Parliamentary Representatives, the Islamic Association of University Instructors, the Iranian Women's Journalist Association, the Cultural Association of Islamic Iran, the Unity Party, and the Association of Teachers and Researchers of Qom Seminary School. Authorities are holding a series of events to commemorate the Shah of Iran's overthrow in 1979. Celebrations began this week and will culminate on February 11. The government appears to be trying to clamp down even more tightly on opponents as the anniversary approaches. A leading Iranian human rights activist and journalist was arrested Wednesday, activists said. Kaveh Ghasemi Kermanshahi was taken by security agents who searched his home and took personal belongings, including his computer, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said in a statement. Iran has been trying and executing people accused of demonstrating against the June 12 presidential election victory of Ahmadinejad. The initial protests broke out last summer and have persisted. At least seven people were killed and hundreds arrested, witnesses said, as they took to the streets on Ashura, a Muslim holy day that occurred on December 27.","Council for Coordinating the Reforms Front called for people to march ""with their green colors""

"(CNN) -- At the beginning of the school year, a couple of  hundred parents, myself included, gathered in the middle school lounge for the principal's back-to-school speech. The chatting hushed as the principal walked from the back of the room to the podium. As she proceeded down the aisle, parting the crowd of parents, she carried with her the biggest bottle of hand sanitizer I've ever seen. Expert: Washing hands works well to prevent many diseases, but it's not very helpful agains the flu virus. When she arrived at the front of the room, the principal, all 5 feet and 100 pounds of her, used every bit of her strength to hoist the giant jug onto the lectern. ""Welcome back to school,"" she said. ""Swine flu stops here."" The principal explained that between each and every class, the teachers would supervise the children while they sanitized their hands. In addition, students would be washing and sanitizing their hands at other times, such as before lunch and snack. My eldest daughter confirmed that they really were cleaning their hands at least every 45 minutes, but exactly eight days later, the e-mails started to arrive: a case of suspected H1N1 flu in the seventh grade, another in kindergarten, and then another and another. At one point at my daughters' school, they were sending home a dozen students a day sick with symptoms of H1N1 flu. A sneeze in the theater versus a germy handshake . What happened here? How come with all that hand washing so many children still became ill? According to some experts, you can wash your hands all you want, and it won't do much to stop the spread of influenza, including the H1N1 variety. ""Washing hands really is wonderful for preventing many diseases, such as the common cold, but it's not very helpful to prevent influenza,"" said Arthur Reingold, professor of epidemiology at the University of California-Berkeley. I gave Reingold two scenarios. The first: I'm sitting in a movie theater next to -- but not touching -- someone with H1N1, and he sneezes and doesn't cover his mouth. The second: Someone with H1N1 rubs his nose, shakes my hand, and then I rub my nose. In which situation am I more likely to catch the flu? That's easy, said Reingold, an infectious disease specialist who advises on vaccine policy for the World Health Organization. The theater incident is much more likely -- much, much more likely, he said -- to give me the flu, since inhaling particles results in a bigger dose of the virus. A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees there isn't strong evidence that hand washing fights H1N1. ""We don't have solid data on the effect that hand washing has on the transmission of H1N1,"" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner wrote in an e-mail. But he said there's still reason to be vigilant about hand washing. ""There are studies that show hand washing was effective in reducing transmission of other respiratory diseases,"" he said. Dr. Peter Palese, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, said hand washing isn't all that helpful against the flu because the flu isn't like other respiratory diseases. ""The flu virus isn't very stable on the hand,"" he said. ""The virus has a lipid membrane that flattens out when it's on your hand, and it gets inactivated."" The rhinovirus, on the other hand, which causes the common cold, can live quite nicely on someone's hand. ""It has a different architecture than a flu virus,"" he said. ""It's much more stable."" The flu virus thrives in droplets of water, such as the kind that come out of your mouth when you sneeze or cough. ""The lipid membrane stays intact when it's surrounded by a droplet of water that's ten times bigger than the virus itself,"" Palese says. Infectious disease experts and the CDC agree the flu is more likely to be transmitted through airborne particles than through hand contact. However, they disagreed on the extent to which flu is caused by hand contact compared with inhalation of particles. Mark Nicas, an adjunct professor at the University of California-Berkeley School of Public Health, thinks a significant number of flu cases do indeed spread from hands touching one another. ""I think that hand contact accounts for maybe one-third of influenza infections,"" he said. Hand washing: A false sense of security from H1N1? Some infectious disease experts said they're concerned messages from the CDC to wash hands to prevent H1N1 have given people too much faith in hand washing. ""Everyone's eager to promote hand washing, and certainly it won't do any harm, but to rely on a hand washing as a way to prevent influenza is a serious mistake,"" said Reingold. ""Don't kid yourself that you're going to protect yourself from the flu completely by washing your hands,"" said Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The CDC has emphasized other prevention techniques, such as vaccination, as well, Skinner said. ""CDC has communicated from the get-go that hand washing is only one tool in the toolbox used to prevent the transmission of influenza,"" he said. This brings me back to my experience at my daughters' school. The e-mails from the principal said some of the sick children reported to the school nurse that they'd woken up ill, but their parents sent them to school anyway. What's up with that? If your child is sick, keep her at home. If you're sick, don't go to work. Using that particular tool in the toolbox will go a long way toward stemming the spread of H1N1 flu -- probably more than washing your hands. CNN's Sharisse Scineaux and Jennifer Pifer-Bixler contributed to this report.","Hand washing can reduce risk of catching a cold; not as helpful against H1N1 .

"(CNN) -- In the midst of a frantic week in September filled with auditions and deadlines, New York casting director Michael Cassara had zero down time. So one day, when he felt a sore throat coming on, Cassara had his doctor beamed into his office. Michael Cassara was too busy to visit his doctor's office, so he had his doctor come to him -- virtually. Cassara didn't use lasers; he used his laptop. Logging into his account at hellohealth.com, Cassara clicked on the link for video chats and made an appointment, and an hour later, Dr. Sean Khozin popped up on his screen. Based on how Cassara was feeling and his propensity to get strep throat, Khozin diagnosed a strep infection, ""and five minutes later I had a prescription phoned in to a nearby pharmacy,"" Cassara says. The typical visit to the doctor -- call for an appointment, go to the doctor's office, wait in the waiting room -- has remained unchanged for a very long time, notes Meredith Abreu Ressi, vice president of research for Manhattan Research, a health care marketing research firm. But she says you should expect that to start to change in 2009.  Watch more on the future of eHealth » . ""Because of the Internet, we bank differently than we used to, and we plan our trips differently, and we buy real estate differently,"" she says. ""But we still see our doctor the same way our grandparents did. I think we're about to see big changes in this area."" Ressi says to expect to see more doctors close their traditional practices and open ""telehealth"" practices, where they deliver all or part of their services, in one form or another, over the Internet. This means chatting with a doctor online via video, e-mailing your doctor with a question or perhaps going to a Web site where, for a small fee, a doctor will answer your medical questions instantly. Here are five big changes to the classic doctor's visit to look for in 2009. The changes aren't necessarily for the better or for the worse, and we're not recommending you take part in them; they're just part of the trend towards more ""eHealth."" 1. Online house calls . Such services are very limited at the moment, but expect to see more as time goes on. Today, Hellohealth offers patients video chats, texting, instant messaging and e-mails between doctors and patients. There's a $35 monthly fee, and each chat, IM session or phone session costs $50 to $100. Quick e-mails are free, and longer ones cost $150 an hour. Regular in-person office visits cost $150 to $200, and house calls cost $150 to $200. Here are the two catches: Hellohealth doesn't accept insurance, and you can use its service only if you live in certain parts of Brooklyn, New York. It plans to expand to other parts of New York and to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. American Well, another leader in this field, opens its doors January 15 in Hawaii, where patients can communicate online, via phone, text or IM with doctors 24 hours a day at a cost of $10 for five minutes for Blue Cross/Blue Shield members and $45 for non-members. American Well plans to expand to other areas in 2009. 2. Virtual clinics . Some Houston, Texas-area residents can visit clinics in various Wal-Marts, where patients speak via videolink to a physician who works in a central office. The doctor can see a patient's throat and ears via a camera at the end of medical instruments. Emergency medical technicians at the clinics operate the instruments and do hands-on tasks such as taking blood pressure and temperature. A basic office visit costs $59. Last month, I had them do a physical on me. Click here  to see the story. 3. Ask-a-doc Web sites . What's the normal temperature for an infant when taken under the arm? If you forgot to take your medicine today, should you double up on your dose tomorrow? If you've got a quick question, you can try to get an answer from sites that say they have various specialists on hand to give quick answers. Two examples: justanswer.com and askadoctor.com, which charges $15.95 for an answer. 4. Getting your test results online . More and more health systems are putting test results online, so patients can have direct access. This also means you can double-check your doctor. For example, Doug Smith, a patient at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, found his own cancer in a CT scan report -- a cancer his doctor had missed. Read his story here. 5. Twittering doctors . You and your friends aren't the only ones using Twitter. Doctors are starting to use the social networking site to get answers on tough cases, says Jane Sarasohn-Kahn, a health economist and blogger at Health Populi. ""When confronted with a strange set of symptoms, some doctors are going on Twitter and asking other doctors, 'Hey, I've got a conundrum. Can any of you help me out?' "" As for Cassara, video chatting with his doctor hasn't replaced seeing him in person. He still goes into the office and also arranges for house calls. ""There are far more things they can do in the actual room than they can do online,"" he says. CNN's Jennifer Pifer-Bixler and Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","Expert: We bank, make travel plans and buy houses differently; medicine is next .
Ask-a-doc Web sites and virtual clinics are growing in popularity; so using Twitter .
Neither eHealth nor telemedicine will replace seeing a doctor in person ."
"(CNN) -- When Dr. Danielle Ofri first read the headlines, she was horrified: Doctors were prescribing placebos to their patients instead of real medicine. How awful, she thought. How deceptive. Study: Doctors are prescribing placebos, such as vitamins, antibiotics, pain-killers and sedatives to patients . But then, as Ofri read on, she thought, ""Wait a second. By the definitions of this study, I've prescribed placebos."" Ofri, an assistant professor of medicine at New York University Medical School, says when patients complain about being tired, for example, she'll sometimes suggest they take a multivitamin, even though there's no proof they work against fatigue. ""First, I'll do the million-dollar workup on the patient,"" Ofri says. ""I check them out for anemia, diabetes, cancer, asthma, depression, and other sorts of other things. When I can't find anything wrong, I'll explain vitamins have worked for some of my patients, and there's no downside. I don't think that's being deceptive."" Last week's study on placebos published in the British Medical Journal has sparked debate: What precisely is a placebo, and might you, the patient, actually in some cases benefit from one?  Watch more about doctors prescribing placebos » . Placebos, it turns out, are in the eye of the beholder. Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel, one of the study authors and director of the department of bioethics at the National Institutes of Health, says it's unethical for a doctor to suggest a medication that hasn't been proven to work. Other doctors say it's OK -- and sometimes beneficial -- to prescribe something that hasn't been shown to work in studies, as long as it's not harmful. Perhaps, they reason, the treatment -- say a vitamin, or an aspirin -- could have a physiological effect not yet found in studies. Or maybe a treatment will have ""a placebo effect,"" meaning it will make you feel better just because you have confidence it will make you feel better. So how would you even know if your doctor's prescribing you a placebo? And should you take it? ""Not all placebos are created equal,"" says Dr. Christiane Northrup. Below are four placebos that the NIH study found are commonly prescribed, with advice on questions to ask about each of them. Vitamins . Vitamins have several proven purposes. ""If you're a young woman about to become pregnant, it's important you take folate. And Vitamin B12 is necessary to prevent certain medical conditions like anemia,"" Emanuel says. Beyond a few solid examples like these, some doctors think vitamins might help for certain conditions, such as fatigue, while others think they don't. The solution: Ask your doctor if the vitamin has been proven to help your problem. If it hasn't, ask her if she has any reason to think it will work (perhaps, as with Ofri, she's had anecdotal success among her patients). Finally, ask if there's any downside to taking the vitamin, then make your decision. Over-the-counter painkillers . You've heard of the saying ""take two aspirin and call me in the morning""? The most commonly prescribed placebo in Emanuel's study was over-the-counter analgesics, such as aspirin. In Emanuel's view, these doctors were prescribing aspirin without any reason other than that that it might elicit the ""placebo effect."" But Northrup disagrees. ""Why would an over-the-counter analgesic be a placebo? Aspirin's a powerful anti-inflammatory, and inflammation is an important part of many diseases."" The advice here is similar to the advice with vitamins. If your doctor suggests you take aspirin for what ails you, ask if there's any proof the aspirin will work. Even if there is proof, ask if the pain reliever could harm you in any way. Antibiotics . Everyone agrees there are cases where doctors prescribe antibiotics when they shouldn't, often because the patient insists on them. In the NIH study, 13 percent of doctors reported using antibiotics as placebos. ""Antibiotics for a viral illness may be dangerous, and it's not a good idea,"" Emanuel says. ""If your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, ask if you actually have a bacterial infection."" Ofri adds there's not always a clear answer to that question. ""If I had a patient who's had bronchitis for two weeks, it's probably because of a virus. But it's not out of the realm of reasonableness that it could be bacterial,"" She says it can tough to detect bacterial infections when someone has bronchitis, so sometimes she'll prescribe an antibiotic. Sedatives . In the study, 13 percent of doctors also said they'd prescribed a sedative as a placebo. This is the only ""placebo"" our doctors agreed on: Sedatives can be addictive, and you want to take them only if you have a condition, such as an anxiety disorder, where they're clearly indicated. ""If your doctor prescribes you a sedative, ask them why, and ask if there's some other treatment, something that's not addictive, that you could do instead,"" Northrup says.","Study in British Medical Journal sparks debate about placebos .
Author says it's unethical for doctors to suggest medication not proven to work .
Doctors often prescribe vitamins, antibiotics, aspirin or sedatives ."
"(CNN) -- Hope Murray thought her prayers had been answered. Hope Murray, left, was desperate to find affordable health care for her daughter Meredith. Her daughter, Meredith, desperately needed to see a doctor after suffering a brain injury in a car accident, but health insurance companies wouldn't sell her a policy because of her pre-existing condition. So Murray was relieved to find Direct Medical Network Solutions Inc. while surfing the Internet. It wasn't insurance but a program that advertised deep discounts at doctors' offices and hospitals. Murray immediately signed up for the program, which she says advertised $30 doctor visits and $50 visits to specialists. ""It was pretty phenomenal,"" Murray said. ""They promised me everything was included,"" including doctor visits, vision, dental and hospital stays. ""They even mentioned the Mayo Clinic."" Murray paid $314 for the card up front and then $179 each month after that. Her daughter made an appointment to see Dr. Robert Epsten, a San Diego, California, gastroenterologist, to get treatment for her Crohn's disease. Epsten was listed on Direct Med's Web site as being part of its network, but when Meredith arrived at Epsten's office, his staff said they didn't accept the Direct Med card. In fact, they said they'd never even heard of Direct Med, Hope Murray says. According to Murray, this same scene played out with several other doctors and hospitals. ""I have never been more angry, more furious about anything in my life,"" Murray said. ""It is a bogus scam that hurts people. It should be a crime for people to do that."" The Federal Trade Commission and at least eight states have taken action against more than two dozen health cards for offering discounts services that don't exist. ""Medical discount cards are spreading like kudzu,"" said Jim Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. ""There's a tremendous amount of fraud and deception in these plans because they're not well regulated."" ""Medical discount cards are awful,"" said Nancy Metcalf, senior program editor with Consumer Reports. ""They're absolute ripoffs. I would stay away from them completely."" Two to 4 million people have purchased health care discount cards like the one Murray bought, according to the Consumer Health Alliance, a trade group representing companies that sell the cards. The group acknowledges that there are some dishonest companies out there but says they do not reflect the majority of the industry. On its Web site, Consumer Health Alliance has set up a consumer guide for shopping for a discount health care program. The cards are attractive to people like Murray who don't have health insurance from their jobs and can't buy it on their own. ""Members stay in these programs because they see the savings,"" said Allen Erenbaum, a lawyer for the Consumer Health Alliance. ""Discount health care programs aren't the answer to this country's health care crisis, but for people without any access to insurance, saving money with these programs is better than nothing."" Hope Murray canceled her daughter's card in March, three months after signing up. Meredith, who recently received a master's degree in rehabilitative counseling, is now looking for a job with health benefits. Repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment from Direct Med have gone unanswered. Epsten is still listed on Direct Med's Web site as an in-network doctor, but when CNN called his office, his staff said they didn't accept the card. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners says that although some discount cards are fraudulent, others are legitimate. Here are some tips to know a good company from a bad one. Consumer advocates say you should suspect a scam if: . 1. You learn of the discount card from a blast fax or Internet popup ad. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners considers this a red flag that you're about to be scammed. You can read the rest of the warnings on its Web site. 2. They promise a certain percentage savings. ""A 30 percent discount means nothing. Thirty percent off of what?"" Metcalf asked. 3. They use the term ""guaranteed coverage."" This makes the card sound like insurance, which it's not, says the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. The coalition also lists other scam alerts on its Web site. 4. They won't give you a list of providers until you sign up. The discount card company should tell you the providers up front. If they won't, hang up the phone. If they do, call the providers and verify that they take the card. 5. It sounds too good to be true. ""If you've looked into getting regular insurance and gotten a price, and then you find something way cheaper, that's a huge red flag,"" Metcalf said. ""It's cheaper for a reason.""

"(CNN) -- Pat Folsom, 54, knows the importance of preventive medicine. As a health care worker, she goes for scheduled checkups. So when she went in for a routine dental exam last year, she didn't expect more than a cleaning, maybe a filling. But her dentist found something more serious. ""She told me I had a lesion on my cheek and that it needed to be checked,"" Folsom said. ""After a lot of tests, they found it was oral cancer."" Folsom was surprised. ""I thought surely this was a mistake. I never smoked, I never drank heavily, and I never had a family history of this. How could this be?"" she asked. About 34,000 new U.S. cases of oral cancer are diagnosed each year, and the numbers are rising, according to the Oral Cancer Foundation. Although oral cancer has primarily been a man's illness, affecting six men for every woman, the foundation says that over the past 10 years, that ratio has become two men to each woman. The foundation attributes the rise to the increase in the number of women who smoke and drink excessively, because both tobacco and alcohol trigger oral cancer. But there is another factor. In some cases, women are being found to have oral cancer caused by HPV, or the human papillomavirus (version 16). Different versions of HPV are present in most cases of cervical cancer. Like cervical cancer, in oral cancer cases, the virus is transferred through sexual activity. Watch more on the HPV-oral cancer link . Based on recent data, the Oral Cancer Foundation believes in people under the age of 50, HPV may even be replacing tobacco as the primary cause of the spread of oral cancer. Folsom was shocked when she heard her cancer contained HPV cells. ""I said, 'What? How is that possible?' "" she exclaimed. ""But doctors told me that it might have been caused by something I did, years and years ago. It could actually show up later and cause the cancer."" MayoClinic.com: Mouth cancer . HPV causes irregular cells to multiply, The virus thrives in a moist, dark environment, said Dr. Youssef Obeid, a prosthodontist and director of Obeid Dental in Bethesda, Maryland. Prosthodontists specialize in tooth replacement, jaw restructuring, disease and injuries to the mouth. ""The mouth is a perfect place for it to grow."" By transferring the virus during oral sex, it stays in the mouth and causes lesions. Many eventually turn cancerous. ""It's something we are very much aware of and look for, especially in women,"" he said. Folsom was lucky. Her dentist caught the cancer before it spread, a fact that Folsom attributes to her biannual checkups. When found early, oral cancer patients have an 80 to 90 percent survival rate. A good dentist will look for possible signs of oral cancer by checking the cheeks, the tongue, the tonsils and the larynx for possible lesions, says the American Dental Association. ""That's why we ask the patients simple things, to move your tongue, move it sideways, stick your tongue out, say ahhh,"" Obeid said. '""We want to get a good view of the mouth."" MayoClinic.com: HPV infection . Since Folsom's cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, she's undergone surgery and has had about four months of radiation. She is still in rehabilitation to help her chew and open her mouth wider. She uses a mouth exerciser that helps her stretch the muscles that were affected by her operation. She also went through rehab when she broke her collarbone after her radiation treatments, because her bones had become so brittle. ""It just snapped one day,"" she said with a shrug. ""That's part of the side effects from the radiation. It affects your bones."" Her other side effects are minor. She constantly has dry mouth and carries water with her everywhere. She avoids anything spicy or acidic, because it can sting the area where the cancer was removed. She lost almost 50 pounds after the surgery because she couldn't eat. In some ways she considers the weight loss a good thing because it also reduced her high blood pressure and she was able to drop that medication. ""For everything, there is a blessing,"" she said. Although Folsom is cancer free now, she said she is considering enrolling in a trial that uses a form of the HPV vaccine to prevent patient's oral cancer from recurring. MayoClinic.com: Chewing tobacco: Not a safe alternative to cigarettes . ""It's been a long road to recovery. But I am very fortunate. I've had great treatment and great care,"" she said. ""But the most important thing is I want women to be aware of oral cancer and make sure they don't ignore a sore in their mouth, or pain. It could be something,"" Folsom said. ""And it needs to be checked out. That checkup can save your life.""","About 34,000 new U.S. cases of oral cancer diagnosed annually;  numbers are rising .

"(CNN) -- A world record was set recently in Houston, Texas. It wasn't the world's fastest quarter-mile run, the world's largest pumpkin or even the world's heaviest man. It was, however, as stunning to witness: the world's largest senior citizen Wii bowling tournament, as confirmed by Guinness World Records. The largest senior citizen Wii bowling tournament also included a health fair and immunization clinic. The event, put on by TexanPlus -- the Houston area's largest Medicare HMO -- drew more than 1,500 supporters and 600 senior bowlers to break a record but also to have fun and dish out a little bit of Texas-style competition and a side helping of health information. ""I'm in it to win it,"" one man said as he rolled his walker up to the foul line. One booty-shakin' grandma even showed off her victory dance after she Wii-bowled a strike. Aside from a seniors-gone-wild moment, this event served a very important purpose: to encourage seniors to get stronger and fitter, possibly saving them from life-altering injuries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in seniors. A fall -- or, worse, a broken bone that limits a senior's mobility -- can be the start of a downward spiral that ends up taking a life, says Dr. Sheldon Zinberg, founder of a senior fitness center called Nifty After Fifty. ""Those, for example, who have hip fractures are likely not to be alive two years from now,"" Zinberg said. ""Fifty percent of them never get out of a nursing home."" Falls are among many concerns for seniors. To help address other life-threatening conditions, such as influenza, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and senior abuse, the event also included a health fair, an immunization clinic and demonstrations on ""cane-fu fighting,"" a method of self-defense that makes use of seniors' canes to ward off attackers.  Watch more on the record-breaking bowling tournament » . If you're a senior and Wii bowling isn't up your alley, there are plenty of other steps you can take to prevent falls. According to the American Association of Family Physicians, seniors can reduce their likelihood of falling by making changes in three key areas. Make sure your home is safe . Remove objects that may get in your way as you walk, install night lights and handrails in bathrooms, and call friends or family members to take care of small projects that require the use of step-stools or ladders. Talk with your doctor . Have your eyes checked for vision changes that may impair your depth perception, ask your doctor about medications that may make you dizzy or disoriented, and use a walking aid, such as a cane or a walker, if your physician recommends it. Get your body in shape . Commit to regular exercise, even something as simple as a daily walk around the block. Exercise can help keep you mobile and flexible; upper-body exercise in particular can help strengthen your breathing muscles. Also, limit your alcohol intake to less than two drinks a day, and if you smoke, quit. As for the Wii bowlers, all the participants -- winners and runners-up -- reported that they were happy they came. ""We were all good,"" participant Sarah Pilgreen said. ""I think its very important for us as we get older to stay in sports and whatever we can do.""","World's largest senior citizen Wii bowling tournament held in Houston, Texas .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There will be more than enough doses of the H1N1 vaccine to go around in the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Thursday. According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll in August, 66 percent of Americans plan to get H1N1 vaccine. She said that at least 6 million doses of the vaccine will be available in the United States during the first week of October. ""The notion that because target groups are supposed to get it first, that there won't be enough, that we're leaving people behind, needs to be corrected,"" Sebelius said at a White House briefing. There ""will be plenty of vaccine for everyone who wants it,"" she said. She said 250 million doses have been purchased, and ""that will be plenty."" Most of the initial doses available in October will be FluMist nasal spray. It is approved only for healthy individuals between the ages of 2 and 49. Pregnant women are not allowed to get this type of vaccine because it contains a live virus. Ten to 20 million doses of the vaccine will be available each week after the first week in October, Sebelius said. Sebelius aimed to dispel another myth: that the vaccine will be too expensive. ""The vaccine is paid for by the federal government,"" she said. ""The vaccine itself will be free, although some providers may charge an administrative fee. We're asking people not to do that, and private health plans say they won't charge a fee, and a lot of providers are saying they won't charge. They understand charging a fee would be a barrier, and they say they want to lower the barriers."" The federal government has asked the states to determine the best way to distribute the vaccine, and the government will get the vaccine to various locations. ""We will drive the vaccine to that site,"" Sebelius said, adding that 90,000 sites have been identified. Both Sebelius and Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged pregnant women to get a vaccine shot. According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll released in late August, 66 percent of Americans plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu. Also Thursday, the World Health Organization said manufacturers would be able to produce 3 billion doses of H1N1 vaccine over the course of a year. The WHO said early data from clinical trials suggest that a single dose of the vaccine will be sufficient for healthy adults and older children. However, the WHO said on its Web site that ""these supplies will still be inadequate to cover a world population of 6.8 billion people in which virtually everyone is susceptible to infection by a new and readily contagious virus."" Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of the WHO's Initiative for Vaccine Research, said that nine countries, including the United States, have offered to donate vaccines for use in developing countries and that the WHO will be coordinating the distribution. She said Thursday that distribution was expected to begin by the end of October. The WHO recommends that health workers be vaccinated first, she said. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Val Willingham contributed to this report.","Sebelius: There will be plenty of H1N1 vaccine for everyone who wants it .

"(CNN) -- When 48-year-old Erin Peiffer, of Eldersburg, Maryland, learned that she had high cholesterol in her 20s, she never thought it would pose a problem. When she was 39, Erin Peiffer, now 48, had open-heart surgery to unblock her left main artery. Although her overall cholesterol number lingered in the low to mid-200s, she figured her medication would keep it under control. But she figured wrong, and heart disease slowly started clogging her arteries. Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, says that over the years, it's become clear to most American women that heart disease is nothing to ignore. It's the leading cause of death of women in the United States, says Nabel, a prominent advocate for women's heart health. But Nabel says many women still don't know all the risk factors for heart disease, especially when it comes to cholesterol. ""For middle-aged women, 40 to 60, high cholesterol is the single most important risk factor for heart disease and heart attacks,"" she said. The Heart Truth: How to lower your risk for heart disease . Peiffer didn't think much about her cholesterol until nine years ago, when, at age 39, she began to feel ill during a water aerobics class. ""I started coughing,"" she recalled. ""I was coughing a lot!"" It got so bad she decided to drive home. The cough, she says, grew worse. ""The coughing continued, but then I was coughing up this pink, frothy stuff, and I knew that wasn't right."" Alarmed, Peiffer left her kids with her husband and drove herself to the hospital. But because of her age, doctors never considered that she might be having heart problems; they figured she had a virus and sent her home. But later tests showed that she had something wrong with her heart. After performing an angiogram, her doctors told her the bad news.  Watch more on women and high cholesterol » . ""They told me I had a 99 percent blockage in my left main artery,"" she said. ""I needed open-heart surgery."" Millions of Americans get a diagnosis of high cholesterol every year. Cholesterol comes from two sources: your body and your food. Your liver (and to a smaller degree, your cells) makes about 75 percent of blood cholesterol. The remaining 25 percent comes from the foods you eat. Cholesterol is divided into two main types. HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is the ""good"" cholesterol because it helps to clear excess fats from the arteries. LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, is the bad cholesterol because it clogs the arteries, increasing a person's risk for heart attack and stroke. The American Heart Association says that in premenopausal women, estrogen tends to raise HDL (good) cholesterol. But as estrogen drops during menopause, HDL levels drop too, and LDL levels rise. That's why women need to know their numbers. For years, physicians believed that hormone-replacement therapy was a good way to protect a woman's heart. However, the heart association recommends that hormone replacement not be used for cardiovascular protection, because recent studies have shown that postmenopausal women using it received no real heart benefit. In some people, improving diet and adding exercise can lower the overall number, but when lifestyle changes don't work and for people who have a genetic predisposition for high cholesterol, medication is usually prescribed. But cardiologists say many people think that because they are taking medication, they're protected and don't need to worry about their numbers. That's just not the case. So what are good cholesterol levels? Your overall cholesterol number should be under 200. If you have other risk factors -- like smoking, high blood pressure or a family history of heart disease -- your doctor may want it lower. A good HDL level of 60 mg or greater is considered protective. LDL should be under 100 mg for those with no risk factors for heart disease and 70 mg for those at higher risk. But again, depending on your health and family history, your doctor may want different readings. The first step in fighting high cholesterol is simple: ""Get a blood test,"" Nabel said. The National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines recommend that everyone age 20 and older get a fasting ""lipoprotein profile"" every five years. It gives your doctor information about total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides, which are the main type of fat in blood. If your numbers are unhealthy, your doctor can advise you on treatment. If you want to avoid medication and try to achieve healthy cholesterol numbers naturally, the American Heart Association has these recommendations: . • Keep your weight down, and cut down on calories, especially from saturated and trans fats, carbohydrates and alcohol. Even small amounts of alcohol can lead to large changes in triglyceride levels (although red wine may slightly bump up good cholesterol). • Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and nonfat or low-fat dairy products. And add fish to your diet. Fish oil helps reduce cholesterol. • Get off the couch and get active. Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise, five days a week or more, can make a difference. After her surgery, Peiffer had her family members' cholesterol levels checked. She found that two of her three children had high numbers, and they are now on medication. Today, Peiffer too takes her medication, eats right and exercises to keep her heart healthy. And most important, she knows her numbers: Her cholesterol is well below 200. She said, ""I tell anyone, anyone who will listen -- my family, friends -- 'Know your cholesterol numbers.' It could save your life.""","Heart disease is leading cause of death of women in the United States .

"(CNN) -- For the past several months, Amy Wolf has been glued to the television, intently watching for information on how best to prepare for H1N1 flu. Eight months pregnant, Amy Wolf (shown with her husband and son) signed up for an H1N1 vaccine trial. She usually does not worry about the flu, but this year is different: Wolf is eight months into her second pregnancy. ""I watch the news like crazy, and it seems like every time I would watch or read something, there was a picture of a pregnant woman,"" Wolf says. She's right to be concerned. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy puts Wolf at higher risk of complications for flu in general, and so far that also holds true for the novel 2009 H1N1 virus. The most recent data show that from April 15 to May 18, 2009, thirty-four percent of the pregnant women infected with the H1N1 virus were hospitalized, and by June, six pregnant women had died. ""I've never heard of something affecting pregnant women more than anyone else,"" says Wolf. More worrisome -- the virus is already widespread in Tennessee, where she lives. Wolf says a neighbor's son was recently hospitalized. ""[H1N1] just seems more real to me than a lot of the other health concerns.""  Track the H1N1 flu » . A perusal through our Empowered Patient inbox found swine flu is a hot topic among pregnant women. We took the questions we received to experts for answers. Is the H1N1 vaccine safe for pregnant women? According to a guide for pregnant women released by the CDC, the H1N1 vaccine ""will be made using the same processes and facilities used to make seasonal influenza vaccines,"" which are already proven to be safe, and are currently recommended for pregnant women. ""We anticipate the safety to be similar to the seasonal flu vaccine, which has been given to millions of pregnant women and has not been shown to have any adverse events in pregnant women or their children,"" says Dr. Naomi Tepper, an obstetrician for the CDC's H1N1 vaccine task force. However, recognizing that pregnant women in particular may be hesitant, Dr. Jesse Goodman, chief scientist for the Food and Drug Administration, says ""out of an abundance of caution"" researchers are conducting studies on pregnant women and other high-risk groups. ""It's always good to have more information,"" Goodman says. The FDA approves and licenses the vaccine. Quiz: Test your H1N1 knowledge . About 120 expecting mothers are participating in clinical trials across the country. Health officials anticipate the results of these studies will be available in the coming weeks.

The CDC encourages pregnant women to get the seasonal flu shot now because it's available, and to also get the H1N1 vaccine as soon as it becomes available. ""A pregnant woman who gets any type of flu is at risk for serious complications and hospitalization,"" the CDC says in its guide for pregnant women. Tepper also says this is important no matter which trimester you are in. ""It should not be delayed until beyond the first trimester because even pregnant women in the first trimester have become very ill,"" she wrote in an e-mail. As a woman advances in her pregnancy, her immune system becomes more compromised, which is one of the reasons both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend women who will be pregnant during the flu season get flu shots. If I get the vaccine while pregnant, will this also protect the baby when he/she is born? ""One of the things the body does very well is give antibodies to the babies,"" says Dr. Buddy Creech, a researcher conducting clinical trials on pregnant women at Vanderbilt University. ""It's one of the greatest reasons we vaccinate pregnant women."" Creech says past flu studies have found that when women get flu shots before giving birth, they help build immunity for their child that is particularly helpful during the infant's first few months of life.  Watch more on pregnancy and H1N1 » . ""If we're going to protect those children, it'll be with vaccines rather than drugs,"" Creech says. Is it safe to get vaccinated while breastfeeding? Should my newborn also be vaccinated? According to the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, the H1N1 vaccine will be recommended for children ages six months and older. Newborns and infants younger than 6 months cannot receive the vaccine. Health officials say breastfeeding is one way a mother might be able to help protect her baby. ""The vaccine is safe if she breastfeeds, and she may even pass along some immunity to her infant,"" says Tepper of the CDC. ""It will also reduce the chance that [the mom] will get the flu and pass it to her infant."" What's the difference between the seasonal flu shot and the H1N1 vaccine? The seasonal flu vaccine is updated each year to protect against the predominant flu strains expected to circulate during the flu season. Health officials say the process and formulation of the H1N1 vaccine is identical to that of the seasonal flu shot. The main difference is that the novel 2009 H1N1 strain was first seen in April 2009, after the seasonal vaccine had been developed. Will the H1N1 vaccine be free of thimerosal? According to the CDC, versions of the H1N1 vaccine will be ordered with and without the preservative thimerosal. Preservatives are sometimes used in vaccines to help prevent the growth of fungi and bacteria that find their way into the vaccine vials.  Read what the CDC says about Thimerosal in H1N1 vaccines . The FDA has approved applications from four manufacturers to begin producing the novel 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine. In all, some 40 million to 50 million doses are expected to be produced. Amy Wolf is not as worried anymore: On September 15, she became one of the first pregnant women in the United States to receive the vaccine. She participated in the clinical trial at Vanderbilt University, where she is employed. ""I thought If I could do something now to protect both myself and my baby, then it just seems stupid not to."" Wolf signed up only after speaking with the researchers at the university and her OB-GYN, and asking a ton of questions. She says, for her, the benefits of participating outweighed the risks. ""I really don't feel like a guinea pig,"" Wolf says. ""I haven't had a single medical professional tell me I shouldn't do it. And that made me feel really confident.""

"(CNN) -- Ken Gehle first noticed something was wrong about a year ago: He'd sit down to dinner and the first bite of food seemed to get stuck in his throat. The social networking site CaringBridge helped cancer survivor Ken Gehle stay positive during treatment. ""As soon as I would swallow or take a big swig of liquid and swallow, I'd be fine,"" explained Gehle. A few months later he started hiccuping at mealtimes. When antacids didn't bring relief, his doctor decided to take a closer look. ""They scoped me, did a biopsy and there it was,"" said Gehle. At age 45, the father of two learned he had  esophageal cancer. He had surgery to remove a tumor and began chemotherapy and radiation. While Gehle was getting medical attention, he felt the need for emotional support as well, plus he wanted a way to communicate with his large extended family. So he and his wife, Tamara, got on the Internet and signed up for an online community called CaringBridge. ""The ability to communicate what's going on, as well as for those who are watching and concerned to communicate back -- it's just simple, but brilliant,"" said Gehle. Health Minute: Watch more on social networking during illness » . It wasn't hard to get started. The Gehles, like others who use CaringBridge, set up what is essentially their own personal Web site. There's a journal area where the patient or a loved one can enter background information as well as updates on the patient's condition. And there's a guestbook area where friends and family members can leave messages of comfort and support. Guests can choose to be alerted via e-mail if there's a new journal entry. Tamara Gehle invited about 200 friends, family and co-workers to visit the site. In the months that followed, the Gehles got about 15,000 visits. ""When I was really in the dumps ... to get up every morning and read what people wrote overnight was one of the key things that got me through my day. It ... helped me say 'OK, let's keep moving forward,'"" said Ken Gehle. Helping people like the Gehles cope with a medical crisis or a life-changing event was part of Sona Mehring's inspiration for the creation of CaringBridge. Twelve years ago, a friend of Mehring's gave birth to a very premature baby and needed help communicating with her family and friends. Instead of making dozens and dozens of phone calls on behalf of her friend, Mehring created CaringBridge. ""It was one of the first blogs. ... It was one of the first social networks,"" says Mehring. Now over 145,000 CaringBridge sites have been created, and in the last 12 months, over 30 million users and visitors have logged on. Other popular sites include CarePages, Planet Cancer for young adults, and Group Loop, where teens with cancer can chat with other teens.  The American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivors Network also offers plenty of support. Researchers say that social support systems can make a difference to people battling illnesses like cancer. ""The jury is still out a little bit on whether social support helps you survive -- but it definitely helps you live better,"" said Dr. Charles Raison, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and CNNhealth.com's mental health expert. He noted that while some studies show a survival benefit and others don't, almost all show an improvement in quality of life. ""When people provide each other with support and encouragement -- that can make the difference in a person's life between ... surrendering to hopelessness and ... finding the gumption to keep going,"" he said. Support networks can also be good for family members, who are at higher risk for depression during a crisis. ""They help take the burden off the family,"" said Raison. ""When you are deeply connected with a loved one who is going through something that is very difficult, it puts tremendous psychological stress on family members. ... So anything that helps a patient come to a more positive, hopeful place is almost certainly going to be good for the mental health of the family members that are also struggling with the illness."" Getting that support, via CaringBridge, has made all the difference to the Gehles. Ken Gehle is now in remission and will continue to get scoped and scanned every six months for the next five years. ""I think ... people expressing how they felt about what I was going through or how they felt about me, helped with keeping the positive going,"" said Gehle.","During health crisis, social support can help a person live better, maybe longer .

"(CNN) -- When Bridget and Scott Bear were expecting their first child, they wanted to know what it would cost so they could set aside enough money in their health savings account. Knowing in advance what the price tag would be for the birth of their son gave the Bears ""peace of mind."" The Omaha, Nebraska, couple went to Alegent Health's Web site and found the My Cost function, entered their insurance information and learned the hospital charges would be around $2,500, Bridget Bear said. When Bridget Bear gave birth to their son, Lawson, on April 2 at Lakeside Hospital -- a healthy 8-pound, 8-ounce baby -- the couple were ready for the bill, she said. Alegent is one of a growing number of hospitals, Web sites, even states, helping patients comparison shop on the Internet before undergoing a medical procedure or test. Hospitals say they're responding to a growing demand from patients who are paying for more of their health care out of pocket, thanks to rising deductibles and the advent of high deductible, consumer-driven plans like the Bears have. In the early 2000s, Bellin Health System in Green Bay, Wisconsin, began receiving more calls from patients wanting to know what a particular procedure would cost, said Jeff Hampton, director of revenue cycle management. ""As sad as it sounds, we had to say we didn't know,"" Hampton said. That's because something like knee replacement isn't one expense but many. There are the surgeon's fee, the operating room charge, equipment and supplies, the hospital bed during recovery, and other costs. Five years ago, Bellin put the information together so would-be patients could get an accurate picture of the final bill. On its Compare Care Line, a Bellin financial adviser provides an average cost from the previous six months for a given procedure and the price range over that time period. ""People are shopping around more,"" Hampton said. ""If consumers want to know what the cost of something is going to be, we should be able to give them an answer."" Alegent, with nine hospitals in Nebraska and southwest Iowa, started My Cost in January 2007, posting the price of more than 500 tests and procedures along with data on quality of care. Integris Health, a 14-hospital system in Oklahoma City, has a Consumer Price Line number that allows patients to learn what the out-of-pocket costs will be for their procedures. The service started in July 2007 after CEO Stanley Hupfeld had some ""secret shoppers"" try to get pricing information, said Nicole White, Integris spokesperson. Consumer Price Line receives between 800 and 1,000 calls a month, she said. Sixteen state hospital associations operate Web sites that allow comparison shopping for such inpatient procedures as appendectomies, maternity stays and knee or hip replacements: Georgia, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin. Other states have their own systems. Minnesota health care providers collaborated on the HealthScores Web site, which allows price comparisons between 110 providers for 103 common medical procedures. The Web site tells what insurance companies pay, on average, for procedures ranging from Caesarean delivery to a colonoscopy. Pennsylvania has detailed price information on cardiac and joint replacement surgeries on its Health Care Cost Containment Council Web site, but the data are several years old. Still, it underscores the enormous differences in prices. For example, knee replacement costs ranged from $11,243 to $97,031 at the state's hospitals. Even individual hopsitals are striving to offer more transparency. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, posts very detailed information about prices on the hospital's Web site. Spokesperson Jason Aldous said it's part of the medical center's mission to provide transparency about cost, outcomes and patient satisfaction. The information is only a starting point, though, Aldous said. ""We want that to drive you to a more informed conversation"" with a doctor, he said. ""A bilateral knee replacement is not like buying a car on the lot."" But Brad Myers, co-founder of New Choice Health, said health care and car buying are a lot more similar than many people think. The eight-month-old site was created to do for health care what automobile pricing guides did for new car buying 20 years ago, Myers said. New Choice Health, which does not charge for its service, lists the average cost insurance companies pay for 400 different procedures at different facilities across the country. Want to know the cost of a colonoscopy in Cleveland? New Choice Health gives you more than 50 facilities, with prices ranging from $550 to $1,200. How about a PET scan in Portland? The site offers more than 20 facilities with a price range of $1,600 to $2,100. The site is designed for people who are uninsured, individually insured or with a high deductible plan, Myers said. Patients who are not covered in a group plan generally get bills three times as high, he said. He advocates bargaining. ""Just picking up the phone will get you 20 percent off. Nine times out of 10, if you want to haggle, it's more like 50 percent off,"" Myers says. New Choice Health, which went live in January, now gets 40,000 to 50,000 users a month, Myers says. Paul Fronstin, a senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said cost sites such as New Choice Health are crude tools because they don't tell people with traditional plans what they'll pay out of pocket. A lot depends on how much of their deductible they've already spent. Also, people with expensive chronic diseases such as diabetes usually reach their deductible early in the year and are less concerned about price after that, Fronstin said. Childbirth is a perfect procedure to price ahead of time, according to Kathleen Stoll at Families USA. Others are not as clear cut. With knee surgery, for example, patients may not know the exact procedure they need or what complications could arise, she said. Bridget Bear said knowing what hospital fees would be in advance gave her and her husband peace of mind: ""We were able to enjoy the anticipation of Lawson a little bit more instead of having to worry about the financial piece of it.""

"(CNN) -- With mostly mild cases of swine flu in the United States, swine flu fears are lessening. But viruses have a way of re-appearing. While nobody has a crystal ball, here are some thoughts about what the 2009 H1N1 virus might do in the months to come. Don't pack your face masks just yet. Public health officials expect the 2009 H1N1 virus to linger a while. 1. Is the swine flu outbreak in the United States winding down? Not yet. Health officials expect to see more cases. However, there are two reasons to think the 2009 H1N1 outbreak will wind down in the coming weeks. First, cases of influenza tend to dwindle when the weather gets warmer. Second, the 2009 H1N1 virus outbreak in Mexico has reached its peak, and numbers there are going down. It is expected that same pattern could happen in the United States. For the latest information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, click here.  Look at a map of swine flu cases » . 2. So does this mean 2009 H1N1 will be gone for good? No. Andrew Pekosz, associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says it's important to keep in mind that the 2009 H1N1 virus is new, which means no one has immunity to it. He points out that the three outbreaks in the last century that were caused by new viruses -- in 1918, 1957 and 1968 -- started with a mild wave followed by more severe waves months later. Scientists dig for lessons from past pandemics . 3. If swine flu comes back, when would it return? ""H1N1 flu could die down soon and return later again this fall when the flu season enters back in full swing,"" says Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. ""This is always a concern with a new strain of a flu virus.""  Watch more answers to your swine flu questions » . Napolitano adds that public health officials will be keeping a close eye on the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season starts soon. ""We'll be working very closely with the international community to understand what happens to this virus over the next few months as flu season begins in the Southern Hemisphere,"" she says. ""That will tell us a lot about whether the virus is changing, whether it's becoming more severe and what measures we might want to take in the fall."" For the latest comments from  Napolitano, click here. 4. In the fall, could we have a pandemic like we had in 1918? At a press briefing last week, World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl brought up the specter of the 1918 pandemic, which killed more than half a million people in the United States. ""In 1918, that pandemic started out as a very mild case of disease in the spring of 1918. ... Cases of the disease almost completely disappeared over the summer, only to reappear in the autumn of 1918 with the vengeance which we all know,"" he said. ""So even though we might be only seeing mild cases now, we cannot say what will happen in the future.""  Learn more about the swine flu » . But many experts believe it's highly unlikely there would be an outbreak anything like 1918. First of all, scientists have a much better understanding of infectious diseases, and health care has improved greatly since 1918. Secondly, the 2009 H1N1 lacks a gene that is present in highly virulent flu viruses, such as the one in 1918. ""I don't think this virus has what it takes to become a major problem,"" says Peter Palese, chairman of the department of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Johns Hopkins' Pekosz adds that people remember the horrific 1918 flu season, but often forget that the two other flu outbreaks caused by new viruses, the ones in 1957 and 1968, were far more mild. 5. Will there be a vaccine for swine flu? Scientists are already working on a vaccine for 2009 H1N1. Making a new vaccine takes five to six months, according to the World Health Organization. The first step is for government scientists to grow ""seed stock"" of the virus to send to pharmaceutical companies, who would turn that stock into a vaccine. Pilot lots of the vaccine would then be tested on people. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases alerted its eight vaccine testing centers to be ready to test a 2009 H1N1 vaccine. 6. Will the vaccine be a separate shot, or will it be put in the regular seasonal flu shot? The Centers for Disease Control has said either is possible. Pekosz says there are concerns the seasonal flu shot might not work well if it includes the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and so the decision might be made to make a separate shot. 7. If a vaccine is available in the fall, who will get it? Public health officials have emphasized that even if a vaccine is available by fall, it doesn't mean everyone will be encouraged to get it. ""I imagine that the choice of vaccination strategy will be a subject of intense discussion and study over the next several months,"" says Dr. Ted Cohen, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Cohen adds that if the vaccine is available only in limited quantities, priority might be given to health care workers and to those at high risk of complications from the flu, such as the elderly, the very young and those with certain chronic diseases. CNN's Jennifer Pifer Bixler and Shahreen Abedin contributed to this report.","Swine flu cases may have peaked, but the 2009 H1N1 virus will probably return .

"(CNN) -- Walk into Lisa Nasser's kitchen most evenings and you're greeted by rich aromas that indicate an exceptional cook is at work on a delicious creation. Colleen Doyle, editor of the ""What to Eat During Cancer Treatment"" cookbook, prepares tuna-bean salad. Cooking is Nasser's passion, but she left the kitchen and the cooking to others for six months in 2006 when she, like her mother before her, learned she had breast cancer. Numerous rounds of chemotherapy left her spent. ""I didn't have the energy to go shopping, bring in the food, prepare the food. I needed to rest, to sleep,"" she recalls. Nasser's experience isn't unique. According to the American Cancer Society, more than a million Americans will undergo cancer treatment this year. For cancer patients, nutrition is especially important, but many find that they are too tired to cook, or the food tastes bad, or they are too nauseated to eat, or they have painful mouth sores -- or all of the above. To coincide with National Breast Cancer Awareness month in October, the American Cancer Society has released a cookbook called ""What to Eat During Cancer Treatment."" Colleen Doyle, registered dietitian and editor of the cookbook, says the book is full of recipes and eating strategies that patients with all types of cancer can adopt to help deal with the unpleasant side effects of treatment. Chemotherapy, radiation and drug therapies often leave patients with nausea, diarrhea, constipation, mouth sores, taste alterations and unintentional weight loss. ""One of the things we did was organize recipes by the symptoms that they might be experiencing,"" Doyle says. ""A lot of cancer patients going through chemo -- no surprise -- feel nauseous around those times when they are getting chemo. And so we talk to them about eating foods that are kind of bland; think about avoiding really spicy foods, any kind of Mexican foods, things with lots of flavors, things with lots of herbs and spices.""  See recipe samples from the cookbook » . That certainly was the case with Nasser. ""I wanted pasta or rice dishes, anything that was bland,"" she says. Doyle says it's also helpful to eat small frequent meals when battling nausea and to recognize that for some, the odor of cooking foods can be unsettling for the stomach. ""If you have somebody who cooks meals for you, it might be helpful for you to be in a totally different part of the house when they're cooking if you're going through a period where the smell of food really bothers you,"" says Doyle. Nasser was fortunate enough to have friends and neighbors deliver meals to her house. Once her nausea started to subside she was able to be more adventurous in what she ate. ""I remember calling a friend saying I wanted grape leaves. I remember wanting that tart lemony flavor and only hers were going to do it,"" she recalls.  Watch Doyle cook in the kitchen » . It turns out that tart, strong flavors help with another nagging symptom of cancer therapy: altered taste perception. Like Nasser, some patients experience a metallic taste that will not go away. For others, food might seem tasteless, as if the taste buds have stopped working. For those problems, the cookbook offers recipes like tuna-bean salad that help wake up the taste buds and mask the metallic taste. ""This dish is full of lots of different flavors: strong flavors in the red peppers, the onion, the celery and the tuna itself. ... It also has a real tangy vinaigrette that can help kind of [push] that flavor quotient up a bit,"" says Doyle. Doyle also suggests marinating meats in Italian salad dressings, or mustard or barbecue sauce, and trying strongly flavored foods such as cranberries, sauerkraut or pickled vegetables. Cooking with glass pans instead of metallic cookware and using plastic utensils instead of silverware might also make a difference. Patients undergoing cancer treatment can also suffer bouts of constipation or diarrhea. One of the best strategies to ease constipation -- a common side effect of chemotherapy, anti-nausea and pain medications -- is to eat foods high in fiber, such as vegetables, fruits (including dried fruit like prunes, raisins or apricots), beans and nuts. What if diarrhea is a problem? ""There's a real concern about becoming dehydrated. So be sure you're drinking plenty of fluids and that those fluids don't have caffeine,"" says Doyle. Broths, diluted juices, sports drinks -- even Popsicles or gelatin -- can help get some liquid into the system. Foods such as applesauce, rice and bananas can help slow down the digestive tract, as can oatmeal and canned peaches or pears. Avoid greasy, fried or very sugary foods because they can be irritants. Thanksgiving marks four years since Nasser's days of chemotherapy drips and intravenous needles. Her health today is excellent and neighbors are once again making excuses to stop by during dinnertime in order to bask in the inviting aromas and sample the rich sauces bubbling up from deep pots on her stove top. Nasser, who didn't have the benefit of the cookbook when she was sick,  hopes to use her copy only as inspiration and not as a tool for providing relief from the side effects of cancer treatment. ""Hopefully I won't need it for that. And if I do, I'll now know what to do,"" she says.","For cancer patients, nutrition is important, but many have a hard time eating .

"(CNN) -- Actor Patrick Swayze's achievements include several feature films such as ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Ghost,"" as well as living with advanced pancreatic cancer for longer than most patients. Patrick Swayze died at age 57 of pancreatic cancer. He fought the disease for nearly two years. That Swayze, who died Monday at age 57, survived nearly two years with the condition is ""quite an accomplishment,"" Dr. George Fisher, an oncologist who treated the star at Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday. Fisher revealed in early March 2008 that the actor was fighting pancreatic cancer. Swayze participated in a clinical trial at Stanford and took an experimental drug there, Fisher said. Fewer than one in four patients who have the disease that has spread outside the pancreas, as Swayze did, are alive a year later, he said.  Watch Fisher talk to King about Swayze's case » . ""Patients can survive two years -- even longer, even with standard treatment,"" Fisher said. ""It's just sad that not as many do."" Pancreatic cancer has affected several other prominent figures, including National Collegiate Athletic Association President Myles Brand, who died of the disease Wednesday. Apple Inc.'s Steve Jobs and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have also undergone treatment for the disease. The American Cancer Society puts pancreatic cancer as the fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the United States. Lung, colon and breast cancer are the first three. Experts say that about 95 percent of those with pancreatic cancer die from the disease. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice or sudden weight loss may lead doctors to look for pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Steven Cohen, acting chief for gastrointestinal medical oncology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Cohen was not involved in Swayze's care. Doctors say early detection carries a better chance of curing the cancer, but often a patient's disease is diagnosed after it has spread. CAT scans may detect the disease early, but that does not mean everyone should have a scan with their physical, Fisher said. ""We're developing algorithms for trying to identify people at risk, and then less invasive ... tests to try to figure out who's got it and who doesn't,"" he said. Despite his illness, Swayze went forward with plans to star in A&E network's ""The Beast."" After the actor responded well to cancer treatment, the network agreed to shoot an entire season of the show. Working on the show while undergoing treatment was ""a great idea,"" Fisher said on ""Larry King Live."" ""I had my doubts as to whether he could actually do it or not, and we had many conversations around that fact,"" Fisher said. Swayze understood ""how difficult the treatment could be, and he understood how difficult the disease could be. But it's just like Patrick to just say he's going to do it and damn it, nobody should get in his way."" ""The Beast"" was canceled in June because of Swayze's illness, after doctors told him the cancer had spread to his liver. For pancreatic cancer patients, doctors are not as concerned with what happens with the pancreas as they are with how the disease spreads elsewhere, often to the liver or abdominal cavity, Cohen said. Failure of other organs that the cancer affects may ultimately cause death. Swayze's participation in the Stanford clinical trial is an important take-away point, Cohen said. Only about 5 percent of cancer patients participate in clinical trials, he said. ""Particularly for a disease like pancreatic cancer, where the standard treatments help some patients but not the majority, the ability to look at new treatments that are promising in the context and controlled setting of clinical trials, I think, is really important,"" he said. Dozens of drugs are in development or being tested in trials for pancreatic cancer, Cohen said. One such medication is paclitaxel, which is currently only approved for breast cancer but has shown promise experimentally in pancreatic tumors, he said. Cohen said he and his colleagues encourage patients to continue their daily activities and live their lives normally as best they can while undergoing treatment. A chemotherapy drug commonly used in patients, called gemcitabine, does not have the harsh symptoms of nausea, vomiting and hair loss seen in other cancer drugs. But sometimes, patients are too ill from their underlying cancer to do much, he said. ""Toward the end, they can get increasing abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, very low energy, sort of a wasting syndrome, and there, a lot of patients just don't feel up to do anything,"" he said.","Patrick Swayze battled pancreatic cancer for nearly two years .

"(CNN) -- Less than an hour before her mastectomy was scheduled to begin, Eve Wallinga's surgeon gave her the bad news: Because of unforeseen complications, doctors wouldn't be able to reconstruct a new breast for her immediately after removing her cancerous breast as planned. She was told she'd have to wait another day for the plastic surgery. According to one expert, the median time from breast cancer diagnosis to surgery is two weeks: ""way too fast."" Wallinga wept openly; she'd dreaded waking up from surgery without a breast, and now she had no choice. ""I was devastated,"" says the 53-year-old writer from St. Cloud, Minnesota, whose breast cancer was diagnosed three years ago. ""I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me."" Today Wallinga considers that delay one of the luckiest moments of her life. She says it gave her the time to investigate other procedures to reconstruct her breast besides the two her surgeon had recommended. With that time, she ultimately made a very different decision. Wallinga's experience highlights an emerging issue in breast cancer care: With so many choices to make -- Mastectomy or lumpectomy? What type of reconstruction? To get chemotherapy or not? -- there's concern women aren't being properly informed about all the treatment options available to them. ""People are typically presented with 'Here's how it's going to go,' "" says Nancy Nixon, director of the Contact Center at the Breast Cancer Network of Strength, which receives more than 45,000 calls a year from people with breast cancer and their families and friends. ""Once we explain to them there are other options, the callers say, 'Oh, I didn't even know that was available.' "" According to a recent report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 70 percent of breast cancer patients who are eligible for breast reconstruction procedures were not informed of the reconstructive options available to them. Nixon says sometimes doctors' hectic schedules prevent them from laying out all the options. Other times, she thinks a doctor might fail to mention or discourage a procedure if he or she doesn't have the training to perform it. Wallinga's surgeon recommended two reconstruction techniques, both of which she says could have possibly harmed healthy tissue and muscle. Disappointed, but thinking she had no other choice, she agreed to one of them. Then the delay that had initially so upset Wallinga provided her the chance to look into other options. ""It gave me the extra time to seek out objective information with a clearer head,"" she says. ""I read books and surfed the Internet and looked at studies and before and after photos and researched surgeons' credentials."" Three months after her mastectomy, Wallinga chose a relatively new procedure she says had been discouraged by her original surgeon, but one that she feels was less invasive, less painful and a better choice for her. Now she counsels women on Internet breast cancer chat boards to investigate all options on their own. ""I hear over and over again from women who are not told the whole story,"" she says. ""It really angers me."" To get the whole story about your options, breast cancer experts recommend that first of all, you try to slow down the process.  Watch more on breast cancer and treatment options » . The median time from breast cancer diagnosis to surgery is two weeks, according to Dr. Steven Katz, professor in the departments of medicine and health management and policy at the University of Michigan Health System. ""That's way too fast,"" he says. ""Breast cancer is not a medical emergency. You have a period of time, certainly weeks, to make decisions."" Katz tells patients to weigh all options and get second opinions. ""Make no decisions in the first visit to the doctor. Let me repeat: Make no decisions in the first visit,"" he says. The sometimes hasty journey from diagnosis to surgery is often initiated by the patients themselves, says Dr. Jennifer Griggs, a breast oncologist at the University of Michigan. ""Many women have the reaction, 'Get this cancer out before it kills me!' They don't realize it's been there for years,"" she says. Sometimes even doctors make this mistake, says Griggs, who is also director of the university's Breast Cancer Survivorship Program. ""I had two patients who were physicians and they jumped the queue and had their mastectomies very quickly,"" she remembers. ""They didn't wait for all the tests to come back, and when they did, the tests showed these women could have kept their breasts, but they had that operating room booked."" Griggs also recommends going beyond your surgeon, who is often the first person a patient consults, for advice. For example, she says too many times women will take a surgeon's advice not to have chemotherapy, without meeting with a medical oncologist, who specializes in chemotherapy. ""You really need a multidisciplinary team. Big academic centers have them, but if your hospital doesn't, create one of your own,"" she advises.

"(CNN) -- When she was about 8, Frida Sepulveda developed dark folds of skin around her neck. It's a well-known warning sign of type 2 diabetes. Frida's mother, Blanca Sepulveda, who has watched other family members struggle with diabetes and obesity, was ""devastated"" to see her daughter experience similar health problems. Now at age 11, Frida is about 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs around 180 pounds, her mother said. Despite a high body weight for her age and height, Frida does not seem to have additional symptoms of diabetes -- or any other major health concerns -- but her parents are trying to reverse the weight problem Frida has had since infancy. The San Diego, California, family is among a disproportionately high number of Latino-American families with overweight and obese children. According to the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, 16.6 percent of Latino high school students were obese and 18.1 percent were overweight. The corresponding national averages for high school students were 13.3 percent obese and 15.8 percent overweight. It's an epidemic that shocked and saddened Lorena Garcia, a chef who appears on Univision and Telemundo. ""I travel all over the country to the major Hispanic festivals and I realized that 90 to 95 percent of the kids that I saw at the festivals were overweight,"" said Garcia, who established the Big Chef Little Chef program to teach Latino youth healthy cooking and eating habits. Watch Garcia interact with her fans » . The problem is caused by a wide range of cultural, social, economic, environmental and possibly genetic factors. Experts agree it is an uphill battle to solve. ""You can't just try to change someone's behavior necessarily without trying to change their environment,"" said Dr. Michael Goran, director of the University of Southern California's Childhood Obesity Research Center. How can childhood obesity be reduced? Blanca Sepulveda, 38, believes her own upbringing in Mexico before coming to the United States in junior high school ultimately contributed to her daughter's weight problem. ""The way I was raised ... you don't [leave] the dinner table until you're done with all your food. That's instilled in you,"" Sepulveda said. Back in Mexico, she said, the food was healthier and fresher, and she didn't drink soda. But she still applied that mentality to her own children, who were born and raised in the United States, where sugar-laden and fattening foods are widely available. The Sepulveda family's story is similar to that of other immigrants who are healthier than their American-born children: Those born outside the United States are less likely to be obese than native-born children, said Luisa Franzini, Ph.D., of the University of Texas School of Public Health. Despite the trends, more study is necessary to determine whether American acculturation is entirely to blame for poor diets among Latinos, an expert says. Rafael Pérez-Escamilla, a nutrition and public health professor with the University of Connecticut, wrote in the June 2009 issue of Journal of the American Diabetic Association that adaptation to U.S. society may explain, to some degree, ""deterioration of dietary quality"" and the risks of diabetes and other chronic diseases. However, he wrote, it's still not completely clear. Healthy food harder to come by . Economic factors play a major role for many Latinos in their weight struggles. Angelica Delgado is trying to overcome the obstacle with the Healthy Latino Families initiative, a culturally tailored nutrition and exercise program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As the Community Research Supervisor for the United Community Center, Delgado is trying to get healthy school lunches in the Bruce-Guadalupe Community School, with which she's working on Healthy Latino Families. About 80 percent of Bruce Guadalupe's student body, which is 97 percent Latino, come from low-income households and therefore are eligible for reduced-price or free lunch. Without money coming in to support the lunch program, it's difficult to fund better quality food and equipment to ensure that it's freshly cooked, Delgado said. For now, she hopes the fun, bilingual setting of Healthy Latino Families will teach children to make smart food choices. The lack of availability of inexpensive, fresh, healthy food is a common for low-income populations in general, Franzini said. Research suggests that more affluent neighborhoods have a higher availability of healthy food, she said, adding that the cost of healthy food is lower in more advantaged communities. The community factor . Exercise also poses tricky problems for Latino children struggling with weight, as many live in disadvantaged areas may make it tough for them to play outside or walk to school. From a physical point of view -- in terms of sidewalks and litter -- those areas tend to be in worse shape than an average neighborhood, Franzini said. But her research also suggests that the social component of a neighborhood affects children's physical activity levels. ""It's not sufficient to just clean up the neighborhood -- pick up the trash and build sidewalks,"" said Franzini, whose study on the impact of neighborhoods' social characteristics was published earlier this year in the American Journal of Public Health. ""It also needs to be a neighborhood where people feel safe and they feel that they can go out and walk and run and exercise and do whatever they want to do."" To that end, Franzini's research indicates that those Latinos living in tight-knit communities often get more exercise than those in more mixed neighborhoods. ""Having a neighborhood which is more connected, where people feel safe -- I think it's all a matter of feeling empowered in a way. And so those who feel that they have this stronger neighborhood from a social point of view, they are also more likely to be physically active,"" Franzini said. Finding solutions . Researchers and community advocates are attempting to combat the Latino youth obesity problem. But the multitude of factors makes the issue a moving target and results of interventions are mixed. For example, about a year after a previous phase of Healthy Latino Families in Milwaukee wrapped up, children reportedly ate better and watched less television per day. Delgado said they are awaiting results from the current program, but she has seen some success already. USC's Goran worked with Latino teenagers over 16 weeks to improve their diets, promoting fiber-rich tortillas and altering recipes of aqua fresca so it would have less sugar. But at the end of the four months, he saw ""no significant improvement in the outcomes."" ""We have to do those studies over longer time periods than we have previously done to kind of give these things a chance to work and kick in,"" Goran said. ""We're ... taking it one step at a time."" And Frida's mom, Blanca Sepulveda, said she is focusing on modifying her own behavior to help her entire family. ""It's a retraining of the mind,"" Sepulveda said. ""It gets hard because you have to be an example.""","A disproportionately high number of Latino-American families struggle with obesity .

"(CNN) -- When Josephine Hathcock of Newark, Delaware, went in for gallbladder surgery, she never dreamed she'd wake up an ovarian cancer patient. Neither did her doctors, who found the cancer accidentally while she was on the operating table. To make matters worse, the cancer was stage 3, aggressive and had spread to her abdomen. Ovarian cancer survivor Josephine Hathcock attended a Super Luncheon to raise awareness of the disease. ""I had no idea I had it,"" says Hathcock. ""I just thought my gallbladder was having problems."" Since that surgery in 2003, Hathcock has undergone numerous treatments, including more surgery and various rounds of chemotherapy. She's made it beyond the five-year mark and is still going strong. ""To be honest,"" she says,"" I didn't think I would be here -- but here I am, and that's good."" Earlier this month, Hathcock was asked to be a guest at a luncheon to raise awareness about ovarian cancer hosted by the first lady of Delaware, Carla Markell. The gathering was part of the Super Luncheon campaign, sponsored by the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund and held throughout September, which is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. The campaign's goal is to raise funds for research into early detection methods, as well as to find a cure. The effort is also designed to raise awareness. ""A lot of people know about breast cancer and the treatments and its symptoms because breast cancer has a strong awareness campaign,"" says Santo D'Asaro, who serves on the fund's junior board. ""We felt it was time to make women aware that there are other diseases, other cancers that can affect them that are just as important.""  Watch more on the Super Luncheons » . The format of the campaign is to have governors or first ladies, such as Markell, host luncheons for the public in order to raise the profile of ovarian cancer. Markell, who is a breast cancer survivor, says it's about time women learn more about a disease nicknamed ""the silent killer."" Paging Dr. Gupta blog: When words fail you . ""One of the most important things we can do is alert people to what the signs and symptoms are,"" says Markell. ""That way, women have a better chance of discovering it earlier."" Doctors say discovering ovarian cancer early is the key to survival. According to the National Cancer Institute, each year, more than 21,000 American women are given a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and more than 14,000 women die from it. Ovarian cancer is called the silent killer because 75 percent of the time, the cancer is already considered advanced -- stages 3 and 4 -- when first found and has spread to other parts of the body. Doctors say early stage ovarian cancer symptoms are barely noticeable; many women don't know they have the disease until it's too late. Dr. James Larson, a Delaware gynecologist-oncologist and a guest speaker at the luncheon, says the symptoms of ovarian cancer are fairly common and could be caused by other less-threatening illnesses, so women brush them off. ""Women can have abominable pain, discomfort, pelvic pain, or they can get full easy, have a loss of appetite, bloating, lower back pain and an urgency to urinate,"" says Larson. ""But these symptoms can also be caused by other ailments we all have every day, such as muscle pain, back issues, even arthritis, or just be part of the natural aging process."" Furthermore, Larson says ovarian cancer is difficult to detect. According to the National Institutes of Health, there is no single effective screening test for ovarian cancer, ""which is the reason we need more money for research,"" says Larson. ""Until we find a screening method or a cure, women will continue to die from this form of cancer."" Larson also stresses that women need to know more about the disease itself. ""I can't tell you how many patients of mine think a Pap test detects ovarian cancer,"" he says, shaking his head. ""I tell them it's for cervical cancer. There is no definitive test for ovarian cancer."" Although there is a blood test called CA-125 that can detect a protein produced by some ovarian cancers, doctors says it's not a good screening tool for two reasons: Some ovarian tumors don't produce enough of this protein to be detected, and the protein can also be produced by benign conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, even pregnancy. Researchers are now working on new imaging techniques that could be used to screen women every so often, much like getting a colonoscopy for colon cancer. Arizona scientists have formed a team to design and build two versions of an ovarian cancer imaging and screening tool that would use new, sophisticated techniques to detect the disease. But these remain in the experimental stages. Progress is also being made on other fronts. The FDA last week approved a new blood test that can help determine whether an existing pelvic mass is likely to be ovarian cancer or not, before a woman has surgery. According to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, education and money for research are the best ways to fight the illness for now. Carla Markell and Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, along with their state Legislature, hope to raise money to fight ovarian cancer by allowing residents to voluntarily donate to the Delaware Ovarian Cancer Foundation Fund on their tax forms. The first lady says it's a step her state is making to help women conquer this silent killer. ""Something needs to be done,"" Markell says. ""And we don't have time to waste, because women are dying.""","Super Luncheons hosted by governors, first ladies raise ovarian cancer awareness .

"(CNN) -- Gilles Frydman wasn't ready to see his friend Dr. Doreen Kossove in her condition: tethered to an oxygen tank, hardly able to speak, living with only one lung, her tiny, frail body ravaged by cancer and barely visible under her blankets. Empowered Patient extraordinaire: Doreen Kossove with her daughter Natasha de Lange. But as he approached the hospital bed in her tiny Berkeley, California, apartment, he saw that she was typing furiously on a laptop computer. Kossove, he learned, didn't let cancer -- in her lungs, chest and brain, and on her spinal cord and her vocal cord nerves -- get in the way of helping others. ""[I have] about 2,000 rare-cancer patients under my gimlet stare,"" Kossove wrote about the patients she communicated with on the Association of Cancer Online Resources, a Web site Frydman founded. ""I have had three deaths and another person dying in the last month among the people whom I advise. The last two current ones are breaking my heart."" Many of these patients say Kossove is the reason they're alive today. A Brooklyn, New York-born pediatrician who practiced in the United States and South Africa, she was found to have leiomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer, in 2001. She corresponded online with her fellow patients nearly every day -- sometimes all day -- until she died February 6. She was 65. ""I owe her my life,"" cancer patient Erica Gero wrote in tribute to Kossove on the ACOR Web site. Gero explained that Kossove convinced her to see a doctor who specialized in sarcomas, a move Gero said got her the treatment she needed. ""Doreen gritted her teeth and would not let go of me until I went to the right kind of doctor. She was polite, but snarky at the same time. And of course, she was right."" Read more tributes to Kossove . ""She was the most powerful patient advocate I've ever known,"" Frydman added. ""The world is missing a hero,"" wrote Chaim Kurz, whose wife, Adina, for eight years has been battling synovial sarcoma, a rare type of soft tissue cancer. Kurz writes under the alias 'Bruce Katz.' ""I remember at one time there was a question as to whether the tumors had spread into my wife's spinal cord or brain. We had nowhere to turn. Doreen was herself starting a new chemotherapy treatment and was extremely tired, but sent me a three-page e-mail explaining in detail what options we had,"" Kurz wrote on the ACOR site. ""She never candy-coated anything, but we knew that she loved everybody who ever asked her a question."" With a mother-hen style, Kossove pushed the cancer patients under her ""gimlet stare"" to hire the right doctor, fire the wrong doctor and find the latest treatments, which can be very difficult for rare cancers. She urged them to question doctors who told them there were no options left; she'd been told the same thing when her cancer was first diagnosed. ""When she joined the ACOR list in 2001, she was told she had one month to live,"" Frydman remembers. ""Her ability to be up on the latest research and to impart the knowledge was uncanny,"" wrote Susan Lowenbraun, nursing director of the Sarcoma Center at Cedars-Sinai Cancer Center in Los Angeles, California, who worked with Kossove to help patients on the ACOR site. ""Even when she felt ill herself, she did research and communicated tirelessly with other patients."" Sometimes Kossove showed impatience for others in her leiomyosarcoma group. If she felt someone wasn't moving quickly enough to fight LMS, which can spread at lightning speed, she let them know in very blunt terms. ""I get very exasperated, very bitter and very worried about the people on this list,"" she wrote to one woman. ""[Some of them] put their heads in the sand. ... If one has high-grade LMS, one has to hit the road running."" Kurz paid tribute to her forcefulness on the ACOR site. ""If she was in the U.S. Army or Navy, there would be peace in the world now -- that is how strong she was,"" he wrote. But she also showed great compassion, inspiring others on ACOR to keep searching for the newest treatment. ""Together we are more, and more effective, than we are separately,"" she often told her fellow cancer patients. Signing off on one message, she wrote, ""Celebrate being alive. Warmly, Doreen.""

"(CNN) -- A single gene, called MYH9,  may be responsible for many cases of kidney disease among African-Americans, researchers say. Dr. Barry Freedman, right, speaks with a colleague in a dialysis center at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Although doctors have blamed hypertension for causing common forms of kidney disease in African-Americans, new research shows that high blood pressure may not be the chief cause. ""The MYH9 gene association in African-American kidney disease is the most powerful genetic cause of a common disease yet discovered,"" said Dr. Barry Freedman, professor of internal medicine and nephrology at Wake Forest University, who led a team of researchers in isolating the gene. About 70 percent of African-Americans with non-diabetic forms kidney disease have the MYH9 gene, and many of them end up on dialysis, he said. The gene predisposes African-Americans to the kidney disease that was thought to stem from high blood pressure. It also gives them a higher risk of kidney disease associated with HIV. ""This genetic finding will forever change the way that we categorize the causes of kidney disease. It has the potential to lead to new treatment options to prevent this devastating disease,"" Freedman said. Kidney disease is a serious health issue among African-Americans, who have a fourfold higher risk of developing all common forms of it than whites in the United States. Dr. Bryan Becker, president of the National Kidney Foundation, called the research ""seminal work"" in identifying a gene associated with common kidney diseases. Still, the gene has not been shown to be the sole cause of kidney damage, Becker said. Diabetes and hypertension remain the most common causes of chronic kidney disease in the United States, he said. There is no reason to screen all African-Americans for the risk variant of this gene, or even all African-Americans with high blood pressure, because it is common among all African-Americans, Freedman said. Genetic screening would be most useful for people who have close relatives on dialysis, meaning they are at high risk, or individuals who want to donate kidneys, he said. There have not been studies on who should be screened, he said. Freedman conducted the research along with colleagues at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes Study. The team discovered that the gene accounts for nearly half of kidney failure among African-Americans, including diabetic-related and non-diabetic-related kidney disease. Researchers are now exploring what kinds of environmental triggers might cause the gene to promote kidney failure. HIV seems to trigger the gene and cause kidney failure, he said. Many kidney doctors had theorized that African-Americans developed kidney disease more often than whites because they might not get to see their doctors as often, had more severe high blood pressure and faced other environmental stressors, Freedman said. But research shows that the risk variant of the MYH9 gene is more prevalent in among African-American populations than white populations and seems to explain much of the excess risk for non-diabetic kidney disease in African-Americans, he said. It is still important for people to treat hypertension, which can speed up the weakening of kidneys in people with kidney disease, Freedman said. Untreated high blood pressure also leads to heart attack and stroke, he said. Dr. Michael Roizen, chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic and author of ""RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?"" said the question still remains whether the gene initiates hypertension and kidney disease, and to what extent hypertension causes kidney disease. ""Most physicians would say that the reason blood pressure is so important is that higher levels of blood pressure cause kidney disease, and kidney disease cause higher levels blood pressure, and there's a vicious circle,"" he said. Becker also noted that researchers will have to sort out the interactions between the MYH9 gene and hypertension, as well as the gene and diabetes. No one knows why African-Americans tend to have a higher risk for hypertension. One controversial hypothesis, known as the Middle Passage theory, is that black people who survived the harrowing trip across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa in the holds of ships did so because their bodies were better able to preserve salt, allowing them to avoid death by dehydration. Therefore, the theory goes, some African-Americans have a higher prevalence of ""salt-sensitive hypertension"": Their blood pressure increases by unusually high amounts in response to salt. This theory has not been proved, or even widely studied, but the idea continues to permeate popular culture and generate discussion. The isolation of the MYH9 gene does not necessarily refute the theory, Roizen said. ""To survive, they had to retain salt, and they had to have a gene to help them do that,"" he said.","Study: Gene predisposes African-Americans to common kidney disease .
Interactions between the MYH9 gene and hypertension are still unknown .
It is still important for people to treat hypertension, experts say ."
"(CNN) --   Over the past week, I've been inundated with questions about swine flu, via Facebook, Twitter, CNN blogs and e-mail. So this week I'm empowering people with information about swine flu: how to protect yourself, what all the numbers mean and why you shouldn't freak out. The most recnt advice from the CDC is that non-essential travel to Mexico should be avoided. 1. Hasn't swine flu been around for a while? Yes. Swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig. In 1976, more than 200 soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, got swine flu. From 1976 until 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received approximately one report every year or two of humans with swine flu. From December 2005 until January 2009, there were 12 cases of swine flu reported. 2. The folks who have it now, did they get it from pigs or people? It appears that no one in the United States with swine flu had any contact with pigs. Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the CDC, said in a news conference Friday that among the first seven cases, no one had contact with pigs. In another press conference Monday, he added that investigators have looked to see whether any of the infected people had contact with pigs, and ""we're not finding that linkage here."" 3. Swine flu is transmitted from animals to humans. Does that happen a lot? Yes. More than 200 ""zoonotic diseases"" are transmitted from animals to humans, including illnesses caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Rabies and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (better known as ""mad cow disease"") are two well-known examples. 4. Should I cancel my trip to Mexico? Yes, you should, unless it's essential. That's the advice from a recent CDC travel warning.  Watch Elizabeth Cohen answer your questions » . 5. Should I be freaking out? A new virus spreading quickly around the world. Young, healthy people struck dead in Mexico. Should we all be panicking? ""Absolutely not,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Swine flu, he said, ""is not spreading all that rapidly. Take the St. Francis School in New York. There's been very little transmission from the schoolchildren to family members, and it certainly hasn't spread throughout Queens."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts, concerns about swine flu . But, Schaffner added, this doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to swine flu. ""We should be alert, keep up with the information coming out daily, and take control by being attentive to your hygiene. Wash your hands very, very frequently and avoid people who are coughing and sneezing."" 6. How close do you have to be to a sick person to get swine flu? ""You can acquire this infection if you're within the 'breathing zone' of a sick person, which is about three to six feet,"" Schaffner said. ""And we usually mean being this close to someone in a confined space. We're not talking about fleeting contact. We're not talking about walking past someone in the street. You need sustained contact."" If you think you might have sustained contact with someone who's ill, read this guidance from the CDC's Web site. 7. Yikes! Every day I'm that close to countless people -- at work, on the bus, at church, in a movie theater. Could I get swine flu from them? Yes. ""If you're standing next to someone on a bus, or sitting next to someone or in front of someone in a theater, you could acquire the infection in that fashion,"" Schaffner said. That's why people with the symptoms of any kind of flu -- fever, diarrhea, body aches, vomiting, etc. -- are urged to stay home and away from groups of people. 8. Wasn't there a vaccine at one time? Is there one now? Yes, a swine flu vaccine was given to 45 million people in 1976. There is no vaccine now, although researchers are working on one. The 1976 vaccine wouldn't be helpful anyway, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy & Infectious Diseases. ""That was a completely different virus than the virus we are dealing with right now, completely different in the sense that the genes are different, and it doesn't have any relationship,"" said Fauci. ""The designation of each one was called the swine flu, but from a viral standpoint and spreading it is quite, quite different."" Here are two scientific articles about the swine flu outbreak and vaccination program in 1976: . •Reflections on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination Program . •Swine Influenza A Outbreak, Fort Dix, New Jersey, 1976 . 9. Many young, healthy people have become sick in the United States. Many of the dead in Mexico have been young and healthy. What's going on? Usually we think of flu as affecting the very young and the very old. This sometimes happens with new viruses. For example, in 1918 when a new flu virus emerged, many of those stricken were young and healthy. One theory is that young people, who have strong immune systems, mount a particularly vigorous response to new viruses. But there's a potential side effect to the response: the body releases dangerous levels of signaling proteins, called cytokines, which can damage the lungs. Scientists believe these ""cytokine storms"" can be fatal. Here is a scientific article about the proposed mechanism of cytokine storms. 10. Why are large numbers of people dying in Mexico, but not in other countries? This is the big mystery doctors are trying to solve right now. Many infectious disease experts say it's most likely a matter of numbers: with more illnesses in Mexico, there are also more deaths. Other explanations: that in Mexico people have, in addition to swine flu, other viruses that make for a more deadly combination than swine flu alone. It's also possible that the virus infecting the rest of the world is a weaker version than the one in Mexico. Among the swine flu mysteries: Why only deaths in Mexico? 11. Could this new swine flu virus have been manufactured by bioterrorists? That's the theory on some conspiracy theorists' Web sites. But experts don't believe it. ""If you were a bioterrorist you'd want to create something that's a lot more deadly than this,"" said Dr. Gerald Evans, an associate professor of microbiology at Queen's University in Canada. ""The problem with influenza is that the second you put it into people, it replicates and mutates very quickly. Even if you created the perfect bioweapon, within a few generations of transmissions, it wouldn't do what you planned for it to do."" 12. I get a flu shot every fall. Will that help protect me against swine flu? ""The short answer is that  the CDC says it's very unlikely,"" Schaffner said. But he said it might be possible. ""I think it's a bit of an open question whether repeated flu shots over years would provide a measure of protection."" 13. I was in Mexico two weeks ago. Could I have contracted swine flu, and the symptoms just haven't shown up yet? No. The incubation period of the swine flu is one to seven days. ""If you just traveled to Mexico and you're home and feeling well you should get on with your daily life and not worry about it,"" Evans said. 14. Can the swine flu virus live on inanimate objects? If someone with swine flu touches a doorknob, then I touch it, could I get swine flu? Flu viruses can live on inanimate surfaces. So theoretically, you could get swine flu from touching a doorknob that was just touched by an infected person. However, that's pretty unlikely, according to Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. ""I personally would not have a major fear of environmental contamination,"" he said. ""Virtually all influenza is transmitted from sneezing and coughing."" Schaffner agrees, adding that flu viruses don't survive in large numbers on surfaces. ""A doorknob isn't a warm, nourishing environment for a virus,"" he said. 15. What should I do if I develop symptoms of swine flu? Call your doctor -- don't just drive on over, Schaffner advised. ""Follow the instructions of your doctor. He might not want you in the waiting room spreading germs to others,"" he said. CNN Medical Producer John Bonifield contributed to this report.","The emergence of the swine flu has raised many questions; here are some answers .
Swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig .
Why people are dying in Mexico but not in other places is still a mystery .

"Pancreatic cancer patients who are obese may be 12 times more likely to have cancer that's already spread to their lymph nodes at the time of surgery than similar cancer patients who weigh less, according to a study released Monday in the Archives of Surgery. In the study, 95 percent of patients with a BMI over 35 had a recurrence compared with 61 percent of other patients. ""What we are seeing suggests there is a difference in the way the cancer grows in obese patients versus those who are not,"" says study author Jason B. Fleming, M.D., of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ""That is an area, from a biology standpoint, that has not really been explored."" Overall, pancreatic cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 (223 pounds or more for someone who's 5'6"") were nearly twice as likely to have cancer recur or to die after surgery, as those who weighed less. Health.com: Are you afraid to go to the doctor because you're fat? Obese patients tended to have slightly larger tumors and were less likely to get chemotherapy or radiation before surgery than other patients. However, the survival rate did not seem to be due to the delivery of cancer care or surgical complications related to excess weight, says Fleming. ""People often wonder if obese patients have a worse outcome because they are more inherently at risk for complications, and we did not find that,"" he says. Health.com: How to achieve your feel-great weight . Fleming says gastrointestinal hormones, insulin levels, and the physiology of lymphatic flow in obese patients may contribute to the spread of the tumor cells. ""There is evidence that certain hormones, or growth factors such as insulin, act to stimulate cancer cell growth,"" he says. ""What I am suggesting is that it's not just the tumor that is different, it's the environment the tumor grows in."" In the study, Fleming and colleagues monitored 285 cancer patients who had surgery to remove some or all of the pancreas. They specifically looked at a subset of 20 patients with a body mass index over 35. Health.com: What you should eat to shed pounds . The patients with a BMI greater than 35 survived a median of 13.2 months compared with 27.4 months in patients with a BMI less than 23 (136 pounds or less, for someone who's 5'6""). At the last follow-up, 75 percent of the obese patients had died, compared with 52 percent of patients with a BMI less than 35. Ninety-five percent of patients with a BMI greater than 35 had a cancer recurrence compared with 61 percent of all other patients. People who are obese are at greater risk of getting pancreatic cancer in the first place, according to Fleming. Other risk factors include smoking, long-term diabetes, hereditary disorders, and chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas is an organ located near the stomach; it releases enzymes to help digest food and produces insulin to control blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women, according to the National Cancer Institute. Even if the cancer is caught early, the prognosis is usually poor because the cancer spreads rapidly, and symptoms (jaundice, depression, weight loss, and upper abdominal pain) may not surface until the advanced stage. Obesity is associated with worse outcomes in other types of tumors too, including breast cancer, according to Fleming. ""This isn't the first time that connection has been made,"" he says. Health.com: Fiber, starch, fats, and serving sizes: Eat right advice for your diet . Tae-Hwa Chun, M.D., an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says ""there is good evidence"" that obesity increases the risk for certain types of cancer such as postmenopausal breast cancer, and cancers of the colon, endometrium (the lining of the uterus), kidney, and esophagus. About two-thirds of U.S. adults are considered overweight, and one-third are considered obese, which is a BMI of 30 or higher, according to the Weight-Control Information Network, a service provided by the National Institutes of Health. Simple lifestyle changes, such as daily physical activity, will help spur weight loss and may help ward off some cancers, according to Chun. Not all pancreatic cancer patients are obese or overweight. Recently, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had surgery for pancreatic cancer. Last year, actor Patrick Swayze was found to have stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which he attributes to smoking. Swayze has been reportedly undergoing chemotherapy. Other procedures, including surgery and radiation, can be used to treat the disease. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) -- A few weeks ago, 22-year-old Tatiana Gulenkina felt bad. Tired with a headache and high fever, Gulenkina knew she was coming down with something. Yet she wasn't sure with what. Besides getting vaccinated, there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick. ""My symptoms were apparently the same as for regular flu: coughs, sneezes, high temperature, sore throat and headache."" she says. But when her boyfriend took her to the doctor, her diagnosis was a little little bit of a shock. ""I had the swine flu!"" Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped counting the number of reported H1N1 virus incidents in this country, the American Medical Association says many of its members are starting to see more cases of the illness, along with early bouts of seasonal flu and colds. It's just that time of year when a lot of nasty bugs are out there. So the question is, what's the best way to protect yourself? Health experts will tell you the most effective way to fight the flu, including the H1N1 virus, is to get vaccinated, which causes your own body to make antibodies that target specific illnesses. After immunization, it takes up to 10 days for the vaccines to take effect. But there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick during the winter. Why boost your immune system? It's what protects you from diseases. It's designed to defend the body against millions of toxins, parasites, bacteria and microbes that would love to invade the body and make it their home. But in order to protect you, your immune system has to be healthy. If it begins to break down, then germs can attack and cause you to become ill. That's why taking care of your immune system, especially this time of year, is a must. And the best way to start is with good nutrition. You need to eat the right foods. ""Your nutrition profoundly affects your ability to fight these diseases,"" notes Katherine Tallmadge, national spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. That means fill up your plate with lean protein, including chicken, fish and fat-free dairy products. Why protein? ""The molecules that fight disease are made of protein,"" Tallmadge says. Watch more on how to rev up your immune system » . And think fats. Good fats. Certain fats improve cellular function and the ability to fight disease. For instance, when people eat more liquid oils, as opposed to hard, saturated fats, the fats end up in their cell walls. With liquid oils predominantly in the diet, cells are more flexible, communicate better and are more able to fight disease . ""More olive oil, canola oil and nuts. These are healthy fats,"" says Tallmadge. Tallmadge also reminds us to include fruits, vegetables and whole grains in our diet. These contain important antioxidants that keep your blood levels of vitamin C, beta-carotene, zinc and B-vitamins high. Which also means think vitamin supplements. But not too many. Nutritionists like Tallmadge warn that you can ingest too much of one particular vitamin or supplement and throw off the nutritional balance of your body, which can affect the immune system. ""Get nutrients naturally through the foods you eat,"" Tallmadge says. As for vitamin pills, she recommends ""just taking a multivitamin with minerals so that all your bases are covered."" If you think you need more of one particular supplement, talk to your doctor, she says. Although good nutrition is key for a healthy immune system, exercise is equally important. Studies have shown that moderate, regular exercise can boost the immune system. But doctors warn don't overdo it. Too much high-intensity activity, such as a marathon or triathlon, can make a person more susceptible to illness for as long as three days after the workout. Says Dr. David Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., and avid swimmer: ""Exercise gets the blood pumping, which helps our heart, our circulation system, all our muscles and organs work better. But if you do too much, in too little time, it can hurt the body."" A daily 30-minute walk can do the trick. And don't forget to rest. A few studies point to shut-eye as a way to boost the immune system, and the National Sleep Foundation says getting the right amount of sleep is part of the ""staying well"" puzzle. Though the exact ways sleep works and how it rejuvenates the body's immune system are still a mystery, sleep experts agree that adequate rest is necessary to keep a healthy body. ""Research shows that everyone needs sleep, and that it's a critical factor in your health, weight and energy level,"" says Dr. Marc Schlosberg, a neurologist who works with the sleep lab at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, also in Washington, D.C. ""Plus, it cuts down on stress."" Scientists and doctors have known for years that long-term, chronic stress can create negative changes at the cellular level of the body, which can severely hurt the immune system. So if you can, try to chill out. Take a break, do some yoga. Walk your dog. Pet the cat. Anything to calm the soul. As for Tatiana Gulenkina, she thinks she might have caught H1N1 flu on her campus, but she's not sure. As a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, stress is just part of a her busy life. But after a week of rest , fluids and ibuprofen, Gulenkina is feeling much better and hopes to get through the rest of the winter without other illnesses.","Most effective way to fight flu, including H1N1 virus, is to get vaccinated .

"Men with prostate cancer who were previously infected with the sexually transmitted germ Trichomonas vaginalis are more likely to have an aggressive form of the cancer, compared with men who never had the STD, a new study says. Researchers say trichomonas, an STD, is most common in men ages 25 to 39. The germ, a type of parasite, can infect the prostate and may cause inflammation that spurs the growth of prostate cancer later in life, says senior author Lorelei Mucci, Ph.D., an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. ""Our underlying hypothesis is around inflammation and, in particular, we believe that inflammation from a variety of sources is leading to prostate cancer progression,"" she says. In the study, Mucci and colleagues compared 673 prostate cancer patients to 673 men without prostate cancer, and tested their blood for signs of a past infection with trichomonas. All the men were enrolled in the Physician's Health Study, according to the report published this week in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. They found that roughly one in five men had been infected with trichomonas at some point in his life. Men infected with trichomonas were no more likely to develop prostate cancer in general. But those with a past trichomonas infection were two to three times more likely to develop an aggressive and potentially life-threatening form of prostate cancer. Trichomonas affects 174 million people around the world each year, and, at any given time, about 3 percent of younger men are infected with trichomonas; it is most common in men ages 25 to 39. However, trichomonas is an STD that's probably on more women's radars than men's because women are more likely to get symptoms such as discharge and itching. Health.com: How to protect yourself from HPV . Only one out of four men with trichomonas develops symptoms, and, with time, the infection often goes away on its own. (The STD can be cured quickly with antibiotics.) ""I think the only time men really seek any medical intervention is if their partner has been diagnosed and then they may go and get treated as well,"" says Mucci. ""I think the general feeling has been that this is an acute infection, it will eventually clear itself, and it doesn't seem to be doing any real harm; but in this case it may actually be doing harm--you're just not seeing the harm until 20 years in the future."" Infections are just one factor that researchers are examining as potential players in the growth of prostate cancer, and others--such as dietary choices--are thought to influence prostate cancer risk as well. Health.com: 10 questions to ask a new partner . ""We are pretty confident that diet has an impact,"" says Dr. Peter C. Albertsen, of the University of Connecticut Health Center, in Farmington. Prostate cancer is rare in Asian countries but relatively common in Western nations, and researchers feel it's probably due to some component of the Western diet, says Albertsen, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""What this study explores and similar studies are exploring is whether there are potentially infectious causes that result in prostate cancer going from a relatively dormant disease to one that's clinically significant,"" says Albertsen. ""This study raises the issue that a common bug, Trichomonas vaginalis, could be such an agent."" While the link to prostate cancer may sound surprising, there are other cancers caused by STDs. For example, cervical cancer in women is caused by the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV). (However, HPV is a common infection and many women who are infected with the virus never develop cancer, which is relatively rare.) Health.com: How HPV causes cervical cancer and abnormal pap smears . ""[Although] there is some evidence that suggests that the number of partners that a man has had over his lifetime is associated with increased risk of developing prostate cancer,"" says Mucci, the relationship is not as clear-cut for prostate cancer as it is for cervical cancer. There is no strong indicator that an STD causes prostate cancer, and researchers suspect that trichomonas is just one inflammation-causing factor that may contribute to the cancer or make it grow faster. ""We think that inflammation is what's important,"" she says. ""This inflammation may result from trichomonas, a dietary factor, or it could result from oxidative stress from something like smoking or other factors."" Health.com: Dating dilemmas -- 8 tips for telling your partner a health secret . Either way, it's too soon to make any changes in the testing or treatment of either prostate cancer or trichomonas, both experts say. ""What needs to happen is a few more researchers need to tackle this issue to either nail this down as a true relationship or dispense with it,"" says Albertsen. Health.com: Who's most at risk for STDs? However, it's an important issue to consider, he says. ""Right now if you asked if the average urologist or internist, 'Does Trichomonas vaginalis lead to prostate cancer?', the answer would be no, and in fact this study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship,"" he says. ""But if we begin to see that infections in general can be associated with prostate cancer, we might begin to take a new view on this disease and the appropriate treatment leading up to it.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Ordinarily, walking on a treadmill is no big deal for Carol Elam -- except when she's dressed in a hospital gown and attached to a heart monitor. Carol Elam 54, started to worry about her heart health after turning 50; her own mother died at age 64. Elam, 54, recently underwent a routine stress test at the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta, Georgia. ""I decided I can't control too many things in my life, but if I can control something, I'm going to do as much as I can to control my health,"" she remarked. Elam is among a growing number of middle-aged Americans who aren't waiting until they feel the first warning signs of a heart attack to see a doctor. Dr. Winston Gandy, a cardiologist at Piedmont and Elam's physician, noted the trend not just in his own practice but in talking with colleagues across the country. ""Ten years ago, 60 percent of the people we took care of were people we had seen before,"" he said, referring to patients who were returning for post-treatment follow-ups. With the advent of medical therapies and technology that can help with early detection, he says, now 60 percent of patients are new to his practice.  Watch more on the new prevention trend » . And, like Elam, he said, many don't have any symptoms of heart disease. Dr. Timothy Gardner, president of the American Heart Association, also noted the positive trend. ""What Dr. Gandy said is true. It is encouraging to see the number of people who are getting the message."" Gandy credited nationwide awareness programs, such as Go Red for Women day February 6, with helping spread the word about heart disease detection and prevention. He reminds his patients that cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer in the United States. More than 80 million American adults suffer from some sort of cardiovascular disease; it's responsible for more than 864,000 deaths a year -- that's one death every 37 seconds. Diagnosing heart disease often starts with a routine visit to a primary care physician. Elam started worrying about her heart health shortly after she turned 50. ""My grandfather died at the age of 54. My mother passed at 64. ... I guess I had a wake-up call with my mother because of her high blood pressure,"" Elam explained. She also learned that three of her siblings and a nephew were being treated with medication for high blood pressure. Given her family history, Elam decided to undergo a baseline screening in 2005 with a treadmill stress test. At the end of the 20-minute exam, Gandy informed her that she had a leaky heart valve and would need to be checked annually. Today, her condition is routinely monitored using a treadmill stress test; she was not put on medication. Under her doctor's guidance, Elam stepped up her exercise regimen, running up to 20 miles a week. She also sticks to a low-fat diet. ""I'm going to be honest: There are days where I don't really feel like running; I want to eat that fried chicken, but then I think that in the long run, that it's a lifestyle that I don't want to chose,"" Elam admitted. After her latest stress test, Gandy gave Elam some good news. ""Overall, she did well. I would put her in the top 1 percent,"" he said. He cautioned that this was just a screening test. If she felt any chest discomfort, he would want to see her again immediately. When it comes to heart disease, ""if we find it before it finds you, the chances of something bad happening are less than 1 percent,"" he said. ""But if it finds you, the chances are upwards of 75 percent that you will die."" The sobering message isn't lost on Elam. Her four children range in age from 12 to 23. ""I have to be here as long as I can to take care of my children,"" she said. ""I also have to set an example for my children.""","Heart disease affects 80 million Americans, kills more than 864,000 a year .

"(CNN) -- At an auction at a gallery in New York recently, a piece of artwork sold for a higher price than had been anticipated by the auctioneers: $4,080. It wasn't a very big piece of art -- just 8-by-10 inches. Technically, it wasn't even art. It was a glossy black-and-white photograph. It had a slight imperfection: there were staple holes in the upper left-hand corner. Someone had written all over the front of the photograph. The person who had scrawled on it was, in fact, the subject of the photograph. He had written: . ""To Patricia Keating, with very best wishes, John Kennedy"" That is what made the photo so valuable to someone: Kennedy had held it in his hands, had run his pen over it. The owners of Swann Galleries, where the signed photo was auctioned, believe that Kennedy had autographed the picture in 1956, when he was a United States senator. The picture itself wasn't worth much; but his signature, personalized to Patricia Keating. ... ""As far as we know, she wasn't anyone famous,"" Rebecca Weiss, a Swann Galleries employee, told me on the day after the auction. ""There's no particular significance to her name."" Then why would someone pay more than $4,000 for the photo? Weiss told me that the identities of the buyers and sellers at Swann auctions are kept confidential, so she could not disclose who had consigned the photo for sale, or who had purchased it. But she said there is a pretty safe rule of thumb about the sale of autographs of renowned men and women: . ""What people are buying is the mystique. They are taking home the autograph knowing that this person once actually touched this item, this person once actually left this imprint, this signature."" She clearly knows what she is talking about; just this weekend, it was announced that another auctioneer had sold what is purported to be perhaps the last autograph Kennedy ever signed: a copy of the Dallas Morning News that he reportedly signed for a woman upon his arrival in that city on November 22, 1963. A man in California purchased it for $39,000. In our digital age, in which images and data are transferred from person to person with the tap of a key, it would seem to be an anachronism: the idea of placing enormous monetary value on pieces of paper upon which prominent individuals once wrote their names. But that personal touch seems to have remained precious; Weiss said that many, if not most, purchasers of autographed items display them as if they were rare paintings: framed and mounted in places of honor. She didn't have to convince me. I have only two pieces of art hanging in my home, and neither would qualify as art in the conventional sense. But I wouldn't trade them for Picassos or Van Goghs. The first is an original theater lobby poster for the greatest movie about newspapers ever made: 1952's ""Deadline -- U.S.A."", starring Humphrey Bogart. The other piece of art is an autograph -- actually, an entire (if brief) handwritten letter. It is a thank-you note. A thank-you note written to a laundry. At the top of the piece of paper, embossed in the italics/script font style of 1950s suburban-housewife stationery, are the words: . ""From the home of ... Elvis Presley"" And beneath it, in blue ballpoint pen: . ""I should like to commend your Laundry for doing a fantastic job on my clothes, you show esceptional care. Sincerely E.P."" That's just how, while living in a house on Audubon Drive in Memphis, Tennessee, in the years before he moved to Graceland, he wrote it. ""Laundry"" capitalized in the middle of the sentence; a comma instead of a period after ""clothes""; ""esceptional"" instead of ""exceptional."" I can't imagine a more wonderful or telling artifact from Presley's life. Who writes thank-you notes to their laundries? The young Elvis, that's who. There's such an essential sweetness to it -- to the very fact of the letter, to the formality of his introduction (""I should like to commend...""), to the adjective he chose (""a fantastic job on my clothes""). I purchased the letter from a gallery two decades ago (for a price that made me bite the inside of my mouth), and I would rather own it than the Mona Lisa. I was about to say that I would never part with it, but in fact I once did, for several months. An exhibit called ""American Originals: Treasures from the National Archives"" was touring the country, and was scheduled to make a long stop at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. Included in the exhibit were the original Louisiana Purchase Treaty, Thomas Edison's 1879 patent application for the electric lamp and the instrument of surrender of the German High Command during World War II. I thought Elvis belonged there, and persuaded the curators of the museum to accept his thank-you letter on loan. The National Archives said they would not object, so long as Elvis' note was not in the same room with the more austere documents. It worked out fine; I thought Elvis would like it that way. He always was proud to be an outsider. In the hallway adjacent to the entrance to the main exhibit -- visitors saw it right as they walked in -- was Elvis' handwritten letter, in a display case, with a plaque that read: . ""This note, written by Elvis Presley when he was on the verge of becoming a star, provides an example of how seemingly trivial documents can increase in value and cultural significance as a result of historic events. It also shows that despite his growing fame in the early 1950s, Presley cared about the feelings of others."" Brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it? I can fully understand why someone in New York the other day would purchase the photograph that John Kennedy once signed for Patricia Keating, whoever she may have been. You don't have to be Patricia Keating to comprehend the value of that picture, just as you don't have to be Elvis' laundry to comprehend the value of that thank-you note. Great art, like great beauty, is where you find it. It is, as they say, in the eye -- or the laundry bag -- of the beholder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Photo signed by JFK recently sold for $4,080, Greene notes .

"(The Frisky)  -- It's not easy being a mother, caring so much about these delicate little dumplings that hold half of your DNA and keep putting themselves in danger. Which is why it's important to not just acknowledge the worst TV moms, but also the best. My personal favorite is Kitty Foreman (Debra Jo Rupp) from ""That '70s Show."" She didn't just raise Eric; she mothered the whole neighborhood of delinquent teenagers while working full-time as a nurse and dealing with a grumpy husband. And she managed to do all that while maintaining her sense of humor, with a little help from her dear friend Kahlúa. The Frisky: 10 worst TV moms . Another fantastic mom was Jean Weir (Becky Ann Baker) from ""Freaks and Geeks."" Because no matter how broody her daughter Lindsay got, she was always upbeat and supportive. I definitely cried a bunch during the Halloween episode when she's excited to give out candy with her daughter, but Lindsay ditches her for James Franco and Jason Segel. Not that anyone can blame her. All the parents on ""Modern Family"" are pretty great, but I love Gloria (Sofia Vergara) because she's raised the most precocious little boy, Manny. And she honestly loves Jay way more than his last wife Peggy, from ""Married With Children."" She's also terribly good-looking and tirelessly cheers on her family. My favorite character from ""The Golden Girls"" was Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty) because she said the most amazing things ever. And even as a 90-year-old, she was still raising Dorothy -- even though she was younger than Bea Arthur in real life. The Frisky: ""Playboy"" rejects TV mom Kate Gosselin and 7 other celebs . Sure, Marge Simpson sometimes forgot about Maggie's existence and Bart turned out to be a brat, but you can't argue that she did a good job with Lisa! And since ""The Simpsons"" has been on longer than any other show, she's been raising those un-aging kids for 21 seasons. And on top of that, Homer is a bigger baby than any of the kids. But Marge still gets up every morning, does her fro, and loves the hell out of her family. If Rayanne's mom was one of the worst TV moms, then Angela's mom, Patty Chase (Bess Armstrong), from ""My So-Called Life"" was one of the best. Her daughter was one of the emo-est teenagers ever and with a bad boy boyfriend like Jordan Catalano, she should have been pulling out her hair. But she managed to be a working mom and give Angela the space to be independent and make some mistakes. When things got dangerous, she stepped in and came to the rescue. ""The Cosby Show"" was an enviable home environment and Clair Huxtable (Phylicia Rashad) managed to have a successful career as an attorney while raising five kids. She was such a beautiful, confident woman and she doled out the lessons like no other. Plus, she was always dancing and wearing really amazing '80s fashions. The Frisky: 10 worst boyfriends and husbands of 2009 . I secretly loved ""The Lizzie McGuire Show"" and Lizzie's mom, Jo McGuire (Hallie Todd), was so sweet. She reminds me of my mom, always trying to be Lizzie's best friend and getting super emotional when Lizzie went away on trips. She did often mess up Lizzie's life when attempting to solve her problems, but Lizzie and Jo had one of the most tender mother-daughter relationships ever. Marion Cunningham (Marion Ross) from ""Happy Days"" was similar to Kitty from ""That '70s Show,"" but much less of a lush. She was the only one allowed to call Fonz his real name, ""Arthur,"" and she was always doting on her grumpy husband, Howard. She also raised two pretty good kids and was a fantastic cook. The Frisky: Six celebs with reality shows in the works . One of the best mother-daughter-friend relationships is between Rory and Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) on ""Gilmore Girls."" She had a rough start -- what with the getting pregnant before graduating from high school, while out of wedlock, and with estranged parents -- but she gave absolutely everything for her daughter.

"One in four American girls ages 13 to 17 have been given at least one shot of Gardasil, the human papillomavirus vaccine that is heavily marketed as a way to prevent cervical cancer. Critics say Gardasil's makers minimized the sexual transmission of HPV and provided unbalanced info. Now, a new study says that Gardasil is safe and no riskier than other vaccines, although there is a small chance of fainting or developing a blood clot after getting the shots, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Still, many adolescent health specialists and epidemiologists continue to question the benefit of vaccinating all girls against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease that causes genital warts and some cases of cervical cancer. A related study in the same journal looks at how the vaccine was marketed. Sheila M. Rothman, Ph.D., and David J. Rothman, Ph.D., both of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, say the vaccine manufacturer, Merck & Co., may have swayed the debate by providing educational grants, ready-made slides, and other materials to professional medical associations such as the Society for Gynecologic Oncology and the American College Health Association. ""Much of the material did not address the full complexity of the issues surrounding the vaccine and did not provide balanced recommendations on its risks and benefits,"" they wrote. ""By making this vaccine's target disease cervical cancer, the sexual transmission of HPV was minimized, [and] the threat of cervical cancer to all adolescents was maximized."" Health.com: How to protect yourself from HPV . In June 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gardasil for girls and women ages 9 to 26. The vaccine protects against four HPV strains, which cause many, but not all, cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added Gardasil to its routine childhood vaccine schedule the following year. Gardasil, which is given in three doses, is recommended for all girls ages 11 and 12 and even for those as young as 9, with catch-up doses for girls and women ages 13 to 26 who have not been vaccinated earlier. Health.com: Top myths about safe sex and sexual health . In 2008, the vaccine had worldwide sales of $1.4 billion. In the new study, the researchers looked at problems reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in the 2.5 years since Gardasil was licensed. Of 23 million doses given during this time, there were 12,424 voluntary accounts of adverse events. In all, 94 percent were not considered serious. ""This continues to be a safe vaccine,"" says lead researcher Dr. Barbara A. Slade, a medical officer at the CDC. ""It does protect against the four main types of HPV that are responsible for cervical cancer, and it does prevent the early cervical lesions that could turn into cancer. This suggests it should decrease risk of full-blown cervical cancer.""  Health.com: 10 questions to ask a new sex partner . Still, the HPV vaccine is not a cure-all. Women and sexually active girls still need to get regular Pap tests to find abnormal cells in the cervix that may lead to cancer. The vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV, and if a girl has already been infected with HPV prior to receiving the vaccine, it won't help her. The vaccine has been criticized for its cost, which is about $360 for all three shots. Overall, 6.2 percent of the reported problems were considered serious. This included 32 deaths among women who received the vaccine. (However, these types of reports cannot determine whether adverse events were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence). There were 8.2 reports of fainting per 100,000 doses and 0.2 blood clots per 100,000 doses, the study shows. Other problems included nausea, headache, a skin reaction at the injection site, an allergic or hypersensitive reaction, skin rash, and autoimmune reactions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition in which the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system. There was a greater risk of fainting or developing a blood clot with Gardasil than there is with other vaccines, the study shows. ""[Exposing these risks] should open the dialogue that people need to have with their physician about whether they need to get the vaccine,"" Slade said. However, advertisements for the vaccine heavily promote its ability to prevent cervical cancer. Dr. Charlotte Haug, the editor in chief of the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association, noted in an editorial that HPV is not always harmful and that most women with healthy immune systems can and will clear it on their own. ""In a few women, infection persisted and some women may develop precancerous cervical lesions and eventually cervical cancer,"" she wrote. ""It is currently impossible to predict in which women this will occur and why. Likewise, it is impossible to predict exactly what effect the vaccination of young girls and women will have on the incidence of cervical cancer 20 to 40 years from now."" The bottom line, according to Dr. Haug? ""Even if persistently infected with HPV, a woman most likely will not develop cancer if she is regularly screened. So rationally she should be willing to accept only a small risk of harmful effects from the vaccine,"" she said in the editorial. Health.com: How to deal with 7 of the most common birth control side effects . Abby Lippman, a professor of epidemiology at McGill University, in Montreal, has publically questioned whether Canada is rushing too quickly to recommend the vaccine for all girls and young women. ""If we want to get rid of cervical cancer, let's know what we are doing before we start launching a vaccine,"" said Lippman, who is also the past chair of the Canadian Women's Health Network. She said she would rather see campaigns aimed at improving access to Pap tests in at-risk populations. ""I am not alarmed about the safety, but we have to ask hard questions about the real benefits,"" she said. ""We don't know how long protection will last, and we won't know if the vaccine protects against cancer for a while.

"(CNN) -- To look at her, you'd never know Jessica Ordona, 25, has a problem with her jeans. ""I don't like the fact that when you sit down, your stomach comes over them,"" she says. Jessica Ordona (in white) disliked the fit of her jeans, so she signed up for a  class she says addressed the issue. A retail specialist with a commercial real estate firm in Bethesda, Maryland, Ordona knows image is part of success. That's why she has been diligent about hitting the gym four to five times a week. But even with all her crunches and lifting, she sometimes experienced denim frustration. Unhappy with her former gym, Ordona decided to join a national health club chain in her neighborhood. Much to her surprise, she found a class called  Skinny Jeans Workout, specifically designed to get rid of those annoying little bulges and bumps. ""It's different than your typical workout class,"" she says. ""It's not high-impact cardio, but you're sweating the whole time because you're working every muscle group."" The Skinny Jeans Workout concentrates on core muscles, balance and posture. A cross between ballet, butt-burning stretches and light weight lifting, the workout involves the entire body. Lisa Grimmer, a group fitness instructor, teaches the class. ""What I love about Skinny Jeans is it takes everything from Pilates -- the core workout, which would be the tightening around of your abdominal muscles, your lower back. People think of that as ""the core."" But there's also the shoulder girdle, which we work out a lot in Skinny Jeans, too,"" says Grimmer. ""So really we're thinking about anything that would be postural or placed into your jeans, so you've got your abdominals, of course, and we work the inner and outer thighs that go into the jeans."" The hourlong class is taught twice a week. Regulars swear they've dropped a jeans size or two since the class began four months ago. They say it not only tightens the tush, but the workout also helps develop the flexibility and strength to hold the back straight. Tracy Cherpeski Bannister, another class instructor, believes posture is key to fitting into tight pants. ""In addition to sort of holding it in, we're also lifting and lengthening and, as we do that, we sort of set our shoulders into place,"" Bannister says. ""I probably said it in class -- we 'tuck our shoulder blades into our back pockets' -- so we're opening the chest as well.""   Listen to Jessica talk about the class » . Bannister says so many of us spend portions of our day stressed, at our computer or rounded forward while driving. ""So this is a good way to kind of set the body back up. ... It makes everything more efficient,"" she says. The class is usually taught in bare feet, for maximum balance. It forces ""our bodies to be smarter,"" says Bannister. She reasons that by freeing up your feet, you have to use your brain as well. ""You have to think and feel what's happening. If you don't [go barefoot], then it's not a waste of time, but you don't get as much out of it as maybe you should.""  Watch Skinny Jeans class participants in action » . But like any exercise program, it's important to take it slowly. ""Any time you begin a new workout, you need to avoid doing too much, too soon. You don't want to go from zero to 60 in 10 seconds,"" says Dr. David Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. ""One of the worst things a person can do is start exercising, overdo it, get hurt and become discouraged. You should look to your instructor for guidance and make sure that person is keyed in to your fitness level."" Johnson likes the concept of the workout. ""Exercises that develop the core muscles are important,"" he says. ""Not only does core strength decrease waist size, it increases your energy and endurance, which make it easier to engage in other physical activities such as golf, tennis -- even shopping for another pair of skinny jeans."" The Skinny Jeans Workout and other programs similar to it can be found at health clubs across the country. While the specifics of the workouts may vary, depending on the health club, the goal is pretty much the same: It's all about zipping yourself up into the smallest jeans in your closet. ""You do it right, you do it a few times, and then you're set,"" Grimmer says. ""My clients love it. ...They all come to the class, and they've seen such great results. I've had people go down sizes in jeans; I've had people tighten up. ... They're standing up a little bit taller, and everything's straighter and very proud.""","Skinny Jeans Workout tones core muscles so gym-goers can zip their skinny jeans .

"(CNN) -- ""Sometimes you can forget about the preciousness of life,"" hospital spokesman Allen Poston thumbed onto his Blackberry after peering into an operating room where a team of 15 doctors and medical staff separated conjoined twins in six hours in surgery. Two-month-old twins Preslee and Kylee Wells required surgical separation. ""I'm standing here in the operating room looking at the exposed beating heart of Preslee Wells,"" he wrote as he walked the halls at the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma University Medical Center. On Monday afternoon, 2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, rolled onto their own backs for the first time, he said. Poston, who updated friends and relatives on the surgery with constant posts from his hospital blog, snapped photos of each girl and showed them to friends and family who had been in the hospital waiting room since early Monday. The news of the operation's success prompted a gush of emotion, breaking the silence that had once filled the room, Poston said. After two months of waiting, the two girls were surgically separated. ""We waited because we wanted the organs to get a little bigger, a little stronger,"" Poston had told CNN over the phone earlier Monday. ""The primary concern was cardiac connection."" After cardiac imaging, doctors determined there was ""very little [cardiac] connection,"" but they remained concerned about a ""liver bridge"" connecting the twins. That bridge, Poston said, posed the greatest operational risk because of its dual use by the twins. Born October 25 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Stevie Stewart and Kylie Wells, the twins are being monitored in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. They are listed in critical condition. ""Today, they leave the OR in two different cribs, one following the other, still close in proximity, but might as well have been a mile apart,"" Poston wrote. ""And that is exactly what everybody was hoping for.""","2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, were in surgery for 6 hours .

"(CNN) -- Retirement hasn't been full of lazy days, rounds of golf and luxury vacations for Gary Terry. When this former telecommunications executive called it quits after a 32-year career, he took up an equally time-consuming volunteer job as chairman of the American Heart Association's Texas chapter. Gary Terry says his being saved by a public defibrillator he'd pressed for was ""divine intervention."" ""I believe the Lord chose me to lead that group,"" said Terry, who lives in Hurst, Texas. But his ""sign from the Lord"" came, not in the form of a dream or a mysterious figure in his morning toast. Instead, it came in the form of a cardiac arrest by the security checkpoint at the Austin airport. ""I was trying to get back to the metroplex because I had a meeting the next morning. I reached down to pick up my briefcase, and I kept going."" Here's where the story takes an ironic twist: Gary Terry collapsed just 18 feet from an automated external defibrillator AED that he and his group -- the American Heart Association -- helped to install just eight months earlier. ""A lot of people say there's a lot of circumstances in your situation that really are unique,"" said Terry, ""and I say no, they're not unique circumstances -- they're divine intervention. And I truly believe that."" But the circumstances of Terry's experience are unique, because there was a defibrillator nearby, and somebody knew how to use it.  Watch more on the heart official saved by a defibrillator he pushed for » . ""When somebody stops breathing and they hit the ground, for all intents and purposes, they're dead,"" says Dr. Art Kellermann, noted defibrillator advocate and professor of emergency medicine  at Emory University. ""There are a few minutes where you can reach through the door and pull them back from death if you act decisively."" And acting decisively, says Kellermann, means following the four links in the ""chain of survival."" Visit CNNhealth, your connection for better living . The first link, according to the American Heart Association, is to recognize there's a problem, and call 911. Next, begin doing CPR, employ the use of a defibrillator and get the victim into the hands of capable medical professionals like the paramedics. ""Research has shown time and time again that you win or lose in a cardiac arrest on the scene,"" says Dr. Kellermann. ""If you don't get [the victim] started before you start transport, the likelihood they'll survive to leave the hospital is less than one-half of 1 percent."" And statistics also show that if the chain of survival is initiated within 4 minutes, the chances of survival can be as high as 60 percent. The good news is, CPR is easy to learn (local classes can be found here) and the automated external defibrillator is remarkably simple to use, even without significant training. According to several device manufacturers, you simply place the pads on a victim's chest, and turn the unit on. Complex algorithms inside the unit's computer determine whether a shock from the machine will help restart a victim's heart. Once the machine determines that a shock should in fact be delivered, it tells the user to clear their hands from the patient's body, and press the ""shock"" button. It's far less complicated than your average VCR, and almost impossible to screw up. It's for these reasons, and the relatively low cost of a defibrillator that Gary Terry continues his crusade. ""I think this is part of the plan, and I think he wants me to keep telling people what a great piece of equipment the AED is."" And Terry says he won't stop until the defibrillator is as ubiquitous in public places as a sprinkler system. ""I'm gonna try to put AEDs in every building and in every house, and then I'm gonna hang them on trees.""","Heart association official suffered cardiac arrest in a Texas airport .

"(CNN) -- When Raffi Darrow brought in her two daughters, Wendy and Alice, for their annual back-to-school checkups this week, for the first time in her career as a mom, Darrow decided to be a rebel. Raffi Darrow decided not to get the HPV vaccine for daughters Wendy, left, 11, and  Alice, 12. Even though every federal health authority says her girls, ages 11 and 12, should get Gardasil, the vaccine that helps protect against cervical cancer and genital warts caused by the human papillomavirus, Darrow instructed the pediatrician not to give it to them. ""Up until now my children have had every vaccine doctors have recommended,"" says Darrow, a graphic designer in St. Petersburg, Florida. ""But most friends, like me, fear the safety of something new."" Even though Gardasil is on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine schedule for 11- and 12-year-old girls, and is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, many parents interviewed by CNN say they're not getting it right now for their daughters out of concern for side effects. ""I'm not saying I'll never do it. I just don't want to do it when they're 11 or 12,"" says Darrow, who debated for a year about whether to get the shots for her daughters. Liz Schlegel, on the other hand, didn't hesitate to get Gardasil for her 15-year-old daughter. ""My older sister was diagnosed with (and beat!) cervical cancer two years ago, and her doctors traced it to HPV,"" says the manager of a small design firm from Waterbury, Vermont. ""I would hate to think that normal sexual experimentation -- the kind that my sister and I and many of our friends and peers ""tried on"" in college -- could result in a life-threatening illness 30 years later."" A survey of 1,122 physicians in Texas showed that about half don't always recommend Gardasil to parents of 11- and 12-year-old girls, even though the CDC recommends it. The survey was published earlier this month in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. In an unscientific QuickVote poll, respondents were split on whether they'd get the vaccine for their daughters, with 43 percent saying absolutely they would, 40 percent saying no way, and the rest saying they weren't sure. As of Wednesday, more than 5,000 people participated in the informal survey. To cast your vote go to CNNhealth.com. Unlike most other vaccinations, Gardasil is not required for a child to attend school. As of 2007, the latest year for which statistics are available, 25 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds had received a dose of Gardasil, according to the CDC.  Read what parents and pediatricians have to say about Gardasil » . ""Although the numbers are low, we are optimistic this percentage will increase over time,"" says Arleen Porcell-Pharr, a spokeswoman for the federal agency. ""We would like to see 100 percent adherence to the CDC schedule, [but] from previous experience, we know that it takes years for a new vaccine to gain acceptance into the market."" Darrow and other parents say they're worried about neurological problems, blood clots and deaths that have been reported to the CDC after a woman or girl has been vaccinated with Gardasil. The vaccine is given in a series of three injections. Read a discussion on TwitterMoms about Gardasil . According to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System run by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, as of May 1, there were 13,758 reports of adverse events occurring after women and girls received Gardasil, out of the more than 24 million doses that had been given to girls and women up until that time. On its Web site, the CDC notes that these events ""may or may not have been caused by the vaccine."" Most of the problems -- 93 percent -- were considered to be mild, such as headache, nausea and fever. But 7 percent involved a hospitalization, permanent disability, life-threatening illness or death. In the data, 39 deaths were reported after vaccination with Gardasil, with 26 confirmed by the agency, six under investigation, and seven unconfirmed. ""There was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine,"" according to the CDC's Web site. Gardasil, which prevents four types of human papillomavirus that cause 70 percent of all cervical cancers and more than 90 percent of genital warts, was heralded as a breakthrough when it was introduced more than three years ago by the pharmaceutical company Merck. Since the reports, Merck has added several adverse reactions to the labeling, stating that some people after receiving Gardasil have developed autoimmune diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, paralysis and seizures. ""It's not possible to reliably estimate the frequency [of these adverse events] or to establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure,"" the label states. Dr. Rick Haupt, the pediatrician who leads Merck's research on Gardasil, says the vaccine is safe and effective for 11- and 12-year-old girls. ""We have good evidence that the vaccine is appropriate to use at this age,"" he says. He added that many countries, including the United States, recommend the shot at age 11 or 12 in hopes of getting girls vaccinated before they become sexually active, because HPV is transmitted sexually. Also, he says it's beneficial to vaccinate children this age because their ""immune response is very robust."" Doctors and Gardasil . When her children were younger, Darrow's pediatrician urged her to get all the vaccines on the CDC schedule. She noticed, however, that when she told the pediatrician she didn't want Gardasil for Wendy and Alice, the doctor didn't push her to reconsider. ""There was no argument, no trying to persuade me, no 'Here's a pamphlet about Gardasil,' nothing,"" Darrow says. Several pediatricians interviewed by CNN said they don't push the HPV vaccine if parents don't want it. ""I consider this to be an optional vaccine,"" says Dr. Arthur Lavin, associate clinical professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. ""I tell parents it's fine with me if you wait, and it's also fine with me if you want that extra added level of protection and we proceed today."" He said about 15 percent of his patients are getting Gardasil for their 11- and 12-year-old girls. Parents researching on the Internet . Before her daughters' checkups this week, Darrow spent several hours doing research on the Internet in order to make her decision about Gardasil. She said what tipped the scales for her were statements made in the media by Dr. Diane Harper, an obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of Missouri who helped Merck do clinical trials on Gardasil, at one point serving on the company's advisory board for the vaccine. Harper told CNN she has concerns about the safety of the HPV vaccine for pre-adolescents, noting that a small number of girls have died or suffered neurological damage after receiving the shot. ""Gardasil is not without risks. It's not a freebie,"" Harper says. Harper says she worries that not enough young girls were included in Merck's clinical trials to warrant giving the shot to all young girls. Merck has given the vaccine to 1,121 girls between 9 and 15 years old in clinical trials without serious side effects, according to Haupt, the Merck pediatrician. He says the company will try to continue to follow these girls for 10 years. In addition to safety concerns, Harper said she wonders whether the vaccine will still be effective for an 11- or 12-year-old after she's become sexually active. Gardasil is ""100 percent"" effective against HPV five years after vaccination, according to Haupt, and Merck is studying whether its efficacy lasts longer than that. Darrow says this is one reason she decided not to get the shots for Wendy and Alice. ""Even if the shot lasts for 10 years, it would run out just when they're at their riskiest time,"" she says. ""If I give it to my 11 year old right now, she'd need a booster at age 21."" She added that she hasn't rejected the idea of getting Gardasil for her daughters, considering that it would give them some protection against cervical cancer. ""I'm going to revisit this again when they're 14 or 15,"" she said. CNN's Sabriya Rice and Jennifer Pifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Many parents are debating whether to vaccinate their daughters against HPV .
Some are concerned about side effects, the vaccine's long-term effectiveness .

"(CNN) -- Before middle-aged men started singing ""Viva Viagra"" in TV ads, before former Sen. Bob Dole appeared in its commercials in the '90s, before the blue pill with a funny name entered the public lexicon, impotence was hush-hush. Viagra entered the market 10 years ago, bringing once taboo subjects like erectile dysfunction out in the open. Now there's no getting away from it. In-boxes are clogged daily with spam mail promising cheap and instant manliness delivered fast and in bulk. Couples exchange amorous, come-hither looks followed by a lengthy recitation of side effects on TV ads. The pill helped more than 25 million men get their groove back and blasted the topic of erectile dysfunction into the open. ""It's like the nuclear explosion,"" said Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, California. ""It created sexual medicine. It allowed the taboo to be broken."" Since the diamond-shaped blue pill debuted 10 years ago, it has become embedded in the public psyche, late-night television jokes and urologists' offices. ""It is one of the revolutionary steps in sexual health,"" said Dr. Ira Sharlip, spokesman for the American Urological Association. ""It ranks with the changes in cultural attitudes about sexuality that were started by [Sigmund] Freud, continued by [William] Masters and [Virginia] Johnson, the two researchers in the '60s, and the work that [Alfred] Kinsey did in the '40s. ""These were the huge steps in the development of our understanding of human sexuality and cultural attitudes of sex."" Men seldom talked about their bedroom troubles before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Viagra as the first oral medication for erectile dysfunction in 1998. ""We lamented the fact that the men had so much shame about erectile dysfunction, how rarely anyone came for medical attention,"" said Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor of urology at Harvard Medical School. Penis injections and vacuum pumps were available, but these treatments weren't appealing. Men with medical conditions such as diabetes, prostate cancer, hyper cholesterol, endocrinological and cardiovascular problems weren't able to enjoy sex, Goldstein said. ""People who couldn't enjoy intimacy before have been given a second life...."" he said.  ""We have had a better life because of it."" Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling a man to have an erection. The drug does not induce desire and works when the man is sexually aroused, according to Pfizer, the makers of Viagra. Urologists heard from patients who had tried the pill that Viagra made them feel as if they were 20-year-olds again. Anti-impotence drugs Levitra and Cialis have come along since. ""Along with the birth control pill in the '60s, this pill really changed people, society and medicine,"" Goldstein said.  ""It changed the patient-physician relationship. You can walk in and ask about sexual functions. It was a major taboo at some point."" Dr. Gerald Melchiode, a Texas psychiatrist, agreed that the pill has helped men open up about their sexual health, but finds the commercials a bit much. ""I've never run across men singing about their impotency,"" he said. Since Viagra's appearance on the market, the dialogue about sexual dysfunctions has helped doctors identify other health problems in their patients, doctors say. ""You always hear someone drops dead,""said Dr. Chris Steidle, a urologist who wrote the book ""Sex and the Heart."" ""It's not sudden death if you couldn't get an erection. It's a symptom of a heart condition. You wouldn't ignore a stroke, but you would ignore erectile dysfunction -- it's a significant symptom."" The man's penis is like ""the tip of the iceberg"" or ""the canary in the mines,"" which serve as an indicator of overall health, Morgentaler said. ""There's now good evidence that shows that men with ED who have no other symptoms of anything are at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes,"" he said. Thousands of studies have been conducted on Viagra. ""The pill that thrills"" is also being studied to see whether it gives athletes an edge in competition. It's been studied to see whether it helps women with their sexual health. Despite the deluge of attention, Viagra doesn't work for about 25 percent to 35 percent of men with erectile dysfunction. For others, it has revitalized and strained marriages. Experts say Viagra gave a window into the psyche of men and women. Some complain that sex should be spontaneous and that popping a pill ruins the romance. Eating food decreases the potency of Viagra, and some say the pill forces them to go on a schedule. Another complaint: Having to use Viagra makes a spouse or partner feel undesirable. ""Sometimes their spouse personalizes it,"" said Melchiode. ""Why does he have to take this pill? Aren't I attractive enough? Aren't I sexy enough for him? That's not unusual for the partner."" Even when Viagra is effective, some men realize that it's not the magic bullet that solves their problems with intimacy, doctors said.  Only about half refill their prescription. ""One has to think beyond just giving a pill to cure sexual problems,"" Melchiode said. ""A typical example is a couple where there's been problems over the years and they can't deal with the problems on a verbal level, so they start withdrawing from one another. They build up a resentment and anger, they have trouble being close to one another and having sex with each other. Just giving them a pill isn't going to touch on all the problems of the resentment and anger."" Sex, it turns out, is part of a bigger web of relationship issues. Morgentaler, author of ""The Viagra Myth,"" said: ""It's unrealistic that there's a pill that fixes all of these things.""","Viagra helped 25 million men with erectile dysfunction and bring awareness .
Blue pill considered a huge step in understanding human sexuality, cultural attitudes .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Doctors don't have to tell 18-year-old ""Rose"" (who doesn't want to reveal her real name) the importance of using a condom every time she has sex. STDs can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which can result in infertility, said Dr. Yolanda Wimberly, left. ""There really is a limit to how much you can trust somebody,"" the young woman said. At 14, Rose contracted two sexually transmitted diseases: gonorrhea and chlamydia. She said she got the STDs from her first boyfriend. ""We used condoms at first. Then, me being naïve, we stopped,"" Rose recalled. ""I thought he was only having sex with me."" The STDs went untreated and eventually developed into pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID, a condition that can lead to infertility. Dr. John Douglas, director of the Centers for Disease Control's Division of STD Prevention, called infertility a ""down-the-road concern"" for many teens. He and other doctors worry about sexually active teenagers and young adults who may be unaware that some STDs may doom their chances of having a baby later in life. He said it is a growing reality for nearly 2 million women in the United States who are infertile. ""We don't know how many are affected by STDs, but they can cause PID. A woman [with PID] has a 10 to 20 percent chance of being left infertile,"" Douglas said. Dr. Yolanda Wimberly, an adolescent medicine specialist with Grady Health Systems in Atlanta, Georgia, explained that PID can damage the reproductive organs by creating scarring and inflammation in the fallopian tubes.  Health Minute: Watch more on teens and the infertility risk of STDs » . ""It can happen to anyone. It does not discriminate,"" Wimberly said, referring to both the chances of contracting an STD and the potential for infertility. Three days a week, she meets with teens and young adults at a health clinic just west of downtown Atlanta. Many of them have one thing in common: a lack of awareness about the dangers of STDs. ""You have the same story coming in over and over again,"" she said. ""It's sad. The names and faces change, but the stories pretty much remain the same."" Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . Wimberly first met Rose when the girl was hospitalized four years ago during her bout with PID. ""It had become a severe infection. ... She was having difficulty keeping anything down,"" the doctor recalled. ""It hurt so bad. It felt like somebody kept stabbing me in my stomach. I couldn't walk or anything,"" Rose said. Doctors treated her with intravenous antibiotics. Both the STDs and PID cleared up. Then, a year later, when she was 15, Rose was diagnosed with another type of STD called human papillomavirus, the leading cause of cervical cancer. Doctors removed some abnormal cells from her cervix, which could lead to pregnancy complications in the future. Rose recovered, and she said she hasn't had any problems in three years, but questions remain about her future ability to have a child. ""I cry sometimes thinking about it, because I want it, but I'm not positive if it can happen,"" said Rose, who dreams of becoming a mother. Wimberly tried to reassure Rose by telling her having PID does not automatically lead to infertility. ""But it can decrease your chances of becoming pregnant in the future,"" Wimberly told her. Wimberly is reluctant to put young, at-risk women through intensive and expensive fertility testing. Rather, she recommends that when they are older and the time is right, they first attempt to conceive a child on their own. In the meantime, Wimberly said, she walks a fine line as she deals with her patients' immediate needs, be they birth control, disease prevention or sex education. Wimberly cautions couples to always protect themselves during sex by using a condom every time. She also tells young men and women to get checked by a doctor for STDs every six months or every time they change sexual partners. Finally, Wimberly urges parents to get involved in the discussion and not to be afraid to talk to their teens about the dangers of unprotected sex and the possibility of becoming infertile. Rose conceded that she learned the hard way. ""I want people to learn from my mistakes so they won't have to go through the same things I went through,"" she said. She recently graduated from high school and, prompted by her own health scare, hopes to become a nurse. Rose also has a new boyfriend and says they ""always use protection, no matter what."" ""You might be in love and trust someone ... but be smart, think 'what if.' Think for yourself,"" she said.","Some STDs may doom teens' chances of having a baby later in life .

"Rev. Al Sharpton greets Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson, and daughter, Paris, at memorial. (ESSENCE)  -- The Rev. Al Sharpton has been a pillar of support for the Jackson family since the moment the world found out Michael passed away. Sharpton is one of the few people to have a close relationship with the King of Pop and the man they both revered, James Brown, the Godfather of Soul. ESSENCE.com sat down with Sharpton to talk about his connection to these two incredible men, how the Jackson family is coping after participating in the most watched memorial service in recent history, and his thoughts about the naysayers who continue to mar Michael's legacy. ESSENCE: You had the unique opportunity to be close to two musical icons: Michael Jackson and James Brown. Were they alike in any way? REVEREND AL SHARPTON: They had some similarities, like both of them were very determined men. I can remember times when both of them faced challenges and responded to those challenges with pain from being disappointed by friends who they feel abandoned and betrayed them but neither one of them ever showed a lack of determination or conviction that they were born to do what they were meant to do. I never saw either of them at the point where they felt they had to give up. Essence: Suzanne de Passe remembers Michael Jackson . In fact, the more adversity, the more determined they became. They were very similar in that way. I remember when Michael was having the fight with Sony over his catalog. He talked to me about how some Hollywood big shots weren't in his corner anymore. These were people he had done so many things for but now they weren't returning his phone calls. He would just say, ""I'm going to beat them, Rev."" ESSENCE: What do you say to those people like Fox's Bill O'Reilly or New York Congressman Peter King who have publically said that Michael Jackson doesn't deserve the accolades he's currently receiving? SHARPTON: I debated Bill O'Reilly on his show last night and he, ironically, said that Michael Jackson wasn't a pioneer like James Brown. I said, that's funny because you attacked James Brown when he died too. Michael Jackson  has sold more records than anyone else in history. This man made the VH1's and the MTV's of the world. He made the cover of Rolling Stone countless times. These are facts. These are not accolades that are debatable. Essence: Highlights of Jackson's life . No one is saying Michael Jackson  and James Brown didn't have their flaws. What we are saying is what they achieved allowed for barriers to be broken down on our behalf. To tell us that we shouldn't celebrate facts is to tell us that we must embrace this supremacist fantasy and I don't think we should do that. ESSENCE: Do you think that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee will get the resolution passed to memorialize Michael Jackson's memory as an American legend, musical icon and world humanitarian? She's getting some flack from some politicians. SHARPTON: I think she will, because if she doesn't get it passed on the first time, there will be so much political pressure that they will have to pass it. Look at the reaction! Michael's funeral ...more people watched it than the Pope's funeral. That's not just Black people. All the Bill O'Reillys and Peter Kings did not dampen the outpouring of love all over the world. It was unprecedented and that's why I believe this will pass. Just like every network ended up covering his funeral as if he was a head of state, at the end of the day, the people have said that Michael Jackson deserves all of this. ESSENCE: How is the family doing now that the public memorial is completed? SHARPTON: They are strong and standing together. This is certainly devastating but they are a closer knit family than people think and have gone through crisis before. They are helping each other through this. I admire their strength and their bond. They know that I'm always there for moral support. We've always had that type of relationship and we always will.","The Rev.

"Dr. Joycelyn Elders served as the first African-American U.S. surgeon general during the Clinton administration. At a 1994 United Nations conference on AIDS, she was asked about promoting masturbation to prevent young people from engaging in riskier sexual activity. ""I think that it is part of human sexuality,"" Elders replied, ""And perhaps it should be taught."" She was forced to resign. Elders, 75, continues to address sexual health and education on the lecture circuit. ESSENCE.COM talked to the retired professor about her advice for President Obama's nominee for surgeon general and the battle over health care reform. Dr. Joycelyn Elders appears at her confirmation hearings for the office of U.S. surgeon general in 1993. (ESSENCE) -- ESSENCE.COM: When you were surgeon general, you were outspoken on controversial issues like distributing contraception in high schools and talking about drug legalization. What advice would you give to Dr. Regina Benjamin, if she is confirmed, about how to approach those kinds of issues? DR. JOCELYN ELDERS: How to approach those issues and keep her job?  My advice to Dr. Benjamin is to decide on the issues that you want to go out and work and fight for. But also know that, if there are issues that you feel strongly about, you have every former surgeon general out there -- we organize and we talk -- who can address some of those issues for you. If she feels like it's a really controversial thing, she doesn't always have to take it on herself. She can let one of us take it on. Another thing that's very important is to always use science-based data to speak out against things, even if they're politically incorrect. That's what the office has always stood for. When everything else drills down, people still believe in the surgeon general. ESSENCE.COM: Do you think the president is being forceful enough about getting Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans to keep a public option in the bill? ELDERS: This is probably something I shouldn't say, but I'm always saying that anyway, so one more time won't hurt. The president is really out there knocking his brains out trying to get this through, but I feel he is taking too much of the lead. He should allow other people in his administration to be out here running from place to place, doing town hall meetings and all of this other stuff. When it gets down to the final bill and shaping it into what you want it to be, then let the president come in to do the heavy lifting. We've got the president out there doing heavy lifting before anyone else. Essence: Cambridge mayor on teaching a lesson on race . ESSENCE.COM: Regarding your comment about masturbation at the 1994 UN Conference on AIDS, if you could do it over would you do it differently? ELDERS: No. That's probably one of the best things I did for this country. I allowed us to talk about sexuality more openly and honestly. We are sexual beings, from birth to death, and we never feel that we can talk about sexual health. You can't be a healthy, well-adjusted human being without a healthy sexuality. ESSENCE.COM: When you were surgeon general, you also advocated for universal health care. How do you feel about the current debate on health insurance reform? ELDERS: We debate health insurance reform every time we get a new president. Obviously this is something we should have done 50 or 60 years ago. We wouldn't be in the mess we're in now had we done that.  Watch Obama's ex-doctor critical of health plan » . But we can't have a healthy nation with ignorant people. We've got to educate our population on how to be healthy and make them understand that they can do more to improve their own health than all the doctors in the world. If we want to reduce the cost of healthcare, we've got to prevent disease and do what we need to do to keep people healthy and well. Esssence: Sonia Sotomayor: A wise Latina . ESSENCE.COM: Do you see yourself as a trailblazer? ELDERS: I don't necessarily see myself as a trailblazer. I think I was saying things that many people thought but didn't say. AIDS was a political football for a long while, and now we are much more into prevention. But then, people are embarrassed to buy condoms and vaginal contraceptive films. Parents don't talk about it. Society doesn't talk about it. We can't talk about it on TV because the kids might learn about it. It just makes no sense what we do. I think that as we learn more, we will be less embarrassed about our own sexual health. And that should still be a big part of the agenda. Just think of how much teenage pregnancy costs. The most common cause of poverty in this country is unplanned pregnancy. People come up to me all the time and say, ""Dr. Elders, you were right. Too bad we didn't listen to you."" ESSENCE.COM: At the time that you were asked to resign, with all the media attention, what was that like? What were you feeling and thinking at the time? ELDERS: It happened so very quickly. I really wasn't expecting it. I was told at 8 or 9 in the morning that they wanted my resignation on [White House Chief of Staff] Mr. Panetta's desk by 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I spoke to Bill Clinton, and I think he understood what I was talking about. I was his director at the Arkansas Department of Health for six years, and I had said nothing different or new. But there's a difference between being a governor of a small state and being the president of the United States. Essence: Will new green jobs go to black people? But the best thing that ever happened to me was getting fired. I've been able to go across the country and meet a lot of people I would have never met otherwise.

"(ESSENCE) -- ESSENCE.com correspondent Roland S. Martin talks with Marlon Jackson, brother of Michael Jackson and a member of the Jackson 5, about the death of his younger brother, the ""King of Pop."" Marlon Jackson smiles for photographers at the 8th Annual BMI Urban Awards in September 2008. Roland S. Martin: Marlon, how did you find out about Michael's death? Marlon Jackson: I talked to Frank Dileo, Michael's manager. Frank told me that Michael last night was complaining about not feeling well. Michael's doctor went over to see him, and Frank said, ""Marlon, from last night to this morning, I don't know what happened."" When they got to him this morning, he wasn't breathing. They rushed him to the hospital and couldn't bring him around. That's what happened. They don't know what happened. Martin: When was the last time you saw Michael? Jackson: It was May 14 at a family gathering. I had just gotten back from Africa. Michael looked great. He was looking well. He was getting ready to go into rehearsals for his tour. I don't know what happened. Martin: There were some reports he wasn't feeling well and was in a wheelchair. Jackson: He wasn't in a wheelchair. He was walking around with his kids. When we saw him, he wasn't in a wheelchair. We all talked. He was doing great. Martin: Was that the last time you spoke with him? Jackson: May 14 was the last time I spoke with him. The last time I saw him. Martin:  Have you talked to any of your other family members about his death? Jackson: I've been trying to get a hold of my mom. I talked to Jackie. I talked to Tito. They feel the same way. A piece of our heart -- a piece of us went with him. It was a shock to them, too. I talked to my brother Jackie and he said, ""Marlon, is it true?"" I said, ""I'm calling them right now to see if it's true."" That's when I called Frank Dileo and I couldn't get to my mom. I talked to him the first time and he was at the house and my mom was in the background crying, and she was just upset. Martin: Was Michael still at the house? Jackson: Michael had passed. Frank told me, ""We lost him."" Martin: And you said a doctor saw him last night, but he didn't see a need to take him to the hospital? Jackson: He didn't take him to the hospital. This morning he wasn't breathing and they rushed him to the hospital. He was going to be 51 in August. Gone too soon. Martin: Marlon, it's amazing to look at the reaction from all over the world.

I'm happy that we did get a chance to just bring happiness to everybody, and Michael took it to another level to bring people happiness. He cared about people a lot. Michael was known all over the world, and that's why people care, and it's nice to see that people care. Not only did they grow up with my brother, but they grew up with the Jackson 5.

"(ESSENCE)  -- Anita Hill will always be linked to the Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. Anita Hill arrives at the United Nations in New York in May 2006. In 1991, her testimony during the confirmation of Clarence Thomas prompted a generation of women to stand up against sexual harassment. On the cusp of the Senate hearing for Sonia Sotomayor, Hill, today a professor of law at Brandeis University, talked to ESSENCE.com about Sotomayor, a former classmate of hers at Yale Law School, and the legacy of her Senate Judiciary Committee testimony all these years later. The following is an edited version of that interview: . ESSENCE: What do you think of Sonia Sotomayor as a Supreme Court nominee? Anita Hill: I think it's an excellent choice, just on the face of the selection. Here's a person who has years of experience on the bench, and has distinguished herself in private practice as well, and has been a prosecutor. I think she's got an incredible breadth of experience. Clearly she's an exceptional mind, having done very well at her undergraduate school, Princeton, and law school at Yale. But that's just the beginning. There are other things that I think make her a great choice. ESSENCE: Georgetown professor knows what's next for Sotomayor . ESSENCE: Things like... being a woman and a person of color? Hill: Absolutely, that's part of it. But I think she's a great choice not simply because she's a Latina. She has acknowledged that as part of her identity, in a way that I think is very responsible and wise. She has said, ""This is the perspective that I come from."" But she has also said, ""I understand that perspective, but I try not to allow that to lend itself to bias."" I like that kind of embracing of one's own identity, but also self-reflection. It means she's going to be aware of who she is and understand how that plays in her decision-making, but she is also going to be quite aware of the rule of law and have great respect for the rule of law, and be able to apply it. We are enriched in the judiciary by having both those concepts in one person, and so what some people have found troubling about her I actually find refreshingly candid and self-aware. ESSENCE: Do you know Judge Sotomayor? Hill: She and I were in law school together; she was in the class ahead of me. I know who she is and knew her in law school, but I have not followed her career closely and haven't been involved with her socially. At Yale, I had a very favorable impression of her. She was very friendly and genuine, but also very serious and dedicated to her work. The thing I admire about her in terms of her career is that she came into a situation where she took full advantage of all the opportunities she had in front of her. Not only did she excel in law school -- where she was an editor of the Law Review -- but after leaving law school, she was a prosecutor, she practiced in a law firm, she was nominated and served as a judge at the district court level, and moved on to the appellate court level. All of those things are to be admired and used as an example of what can happen when an individual is really given an opportunity and chooses to respond and accept the full breadth of responsibilities. ESSENCE: After Justice David Souter announced he was retiring, Vanity Fair and others raised the suggestion that President Obama should nominate you for the Supreme Court. What did you think of that idea? Hill: I actually responded to the Vanity Fair piece. I think there are any number of people, including Sonia Sotomayor, who will be excellent choices. This is a president who has come in and really tried to promote healing between various factions. Nowhere is that more needed than in terms of how we have approached Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. ESSENCE: President Obama's sentiments on Sotomayor . In those hearings, there needs to be a certain level of honesty, but there also needs to be civility and really sticking with the questions that matter about the nominee. I don't think that there is much chance that that would happen if I were nominated, because of things that people would want to get into, that wouldn't be helpful to the process. It's flattering anytime anyone suggests that, and I've been asked more than once. But, in addition to that being kind of an awkward workplace situation (laughs), I think the hearing process would really devolve into the kind of politics that would not be good for the court. ESSENCE: When you testified against Clarence Thomas during his Senate confirmation hearing, you took a lot of heat from African-Americans for publicly speaking against a black man. Was that surprising to you? Hill: No, it wasn't surprising. It also was not universal among African-Americans either. Some people understood exactly what I was trying to achieve by testifying, and other people said, no matter what happened, it was inappropriate for me to give the kind of testimony that I gave. The idea that I would be portrayed as trying to do damage to my race was painful. But, as I said, it wasn't a universally held position. I certainly tried to understand it. I didn't agree with it, but I tried to understand it based on the pain that people have had inflicted on them by racism. ESSENCE: Dig up your roots . ESSENCE: Do you think Clarence Thomas would have been confirmed into the Supreme Court had you been a white woman? Hill: I believe that different people would have reacted differently. Remember, Strom Thurmond was on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I can't imagine that he would have been so willing to embrace Judge Thomas if in fact I had been white. His attitude certainly would have been one that would have changed. And I think that might have been true of some of the other more conservative members of the Judiciary Committee. ESSENCE: My mother used the hearings as a teaching moment. She said if I was ever sexually harassed, I should stand up for myself like Anita Hill. I imagine your experience affected many other women in that way, in terms of empowerment. Hill: I think people hadn't learned that they had a right to speak out, that this was not something that they needed to tolerate. I keep hearing these stories from women who were inspired by those hearings. That wasn't why I did it. I did it because we were choosing somebody for the highest court in the land who was going to be appointed for a lifetime position, and I thought that the Senate ought to consider the information that I had in determining whether or not this nominee was fit for that position. Almost immediately after my testimony, the prevailing wisdom was that no woman would ever come forward after seeing what happened to me. And amazingly, just the opposite happened. ESSENCE: It's been 17 years since you testified. Is life completely back to normal, or is it something that still comes up in your regular life? Hill: It is just a new normal; it is part of my life. It's not something I'm going to try to run away from, nor is it something I dwell on every day. But it is a part of my life, and it's a part of how other people perceive me and what I've done in my life. I'm OK with that. People ask, ""Does it bother you that your name will always be associated with sexual harassment?"" It will only bother me if my name isn't associated with bringing it to an end, or moving the end forward.","Anita Hill testified during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court confirmation hearings .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- She was just 16 years old, a beautiful girl, straight-A student, with her whole life ahead of her.  She hoped to become a nurse. Chanel Petro-Nixon, 16, disappeared in broad daylight and her body was found in a trash bag. Brooklyn teenager Chanel Petro-Nixon left her family home at 6:30 p.m. on Father's Day 2006, to walk to an Applebee's restaurant a few blocks away. She'd planned to meet friends there and fill out an application for a summer job at Applebee's. Friends say she never showed up. No one ever saw her alive again. Four days later, her body was found in another area of Brooklyn, several miles from her home. She'd been strangled and stuffed into a large garbage bag left to be collected with the morning trash on the sidewalk in front of a brownstone. Chanel went missing in broad daylight in an extremely busy area of Brooklyn. Family, police and community members are certain that someone must have seen something, but no witnesses have come forward.  Watch how the teen's body was put out with the trash » . Also troubling to police: The coroner says Chanel died within 24 hours of her body being found on June 22. She went missing on June 18. So, where was Chanel for the 48 hours she was alive but missing? She was strangled, but not sexually assaulted, according to police. Robbery does not seem to be a motive. But Chanel's cell phone and the tennis shoes she was wearing are missing. Chanel's father, Garvin Nixon, insists that his daughter would not stay out after dark without calling home. ""When we called, she always answered her phone, or would call back immediately within a few minutes to tell us where she was,"" he said. Nixon tried calling his daughter to check on her within an hour after she'd left the house. When he didn't get a return call and couldn't reach her, he and Chanel's mother began calling her friends. Her friends had not seen or heard from Chanel either, even though they'd been calling her cell phone repeatedly and leaving urgent messages. Authorities speculate that perhaps she went with someone she knew and trusted, which could explain why no witnesses observed any struggle between Chanel and her abductor. Police have investigated Chanel's MySpace page, searching for clues to whom she may have communicated with before leaving her home the day she disappeared. One theory is that her slaying is linked to that of another local teenager, Jennifer Moore. Like Chanel, she was strangled and her partially-clothed body was found in a garbage bag. But unlike Chanel, Jennifer Moore was raped. Jennifer Moore's suspected killer, Draymond Coleman, was arrested and police have not ruled him out as a possible suspect in Chanel's slaying. Police are asking anyone who finds Chanel's cell phone or sneakers to call the anonymous tip line at 1-800-577-TIPS. The cell phone is a Silver Sanyo Sprint phone, model 8200. The shoes are size 6½, white Nike Air Jordan retro sneakers with green trim and the number 14 on them. A reward of $34,000 is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of the person or people responsible for Chanel's death.","Chanel Petro-Nixon, 16, disappeared during broad daylight in June 2006 .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: The earthquake in Chile was so powerful, it might have affected time! I'm Carl Azuz. You're tuned in to CNN Student News! First Up: Chile Earthquake . AZUZ: Aftershocks, still rumbling across parts of Chile. At least a dozen were recorded from Monday to Tuesday. This quake left thousands of residents without food, without water, without electricity and other just basic services. Yesterday morning, the country's president said that all emergency measures should be in place by the end of the day. Of course, the international community is pitching in, too. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Chile Tuesday, bringing along some supplies and promising that more help is on the way. Secretary Clinton also praised Chile for how prepared it was to respond to this kind of disaster and for how well the nation has responded so far. So, what's with that point we mentioned at the beginning of the show about the earthquake affecting time? Well, according to one scientist, the quake was so powerful it's possible that it affected the Earth's rotation. Based on this scientist's calculations, it should have shortened the length of a day by one-and-a-quarter microseconds. Of course, this is the second major quake to strike recently. Haiti suffered a 7.0-magnitude quake in January. And while that tremor wasn't as powerful as the one in Chile, the devastation that it caused seems to have been significantly worse. Joe Johns examines some of the reasons why. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The quake in Haiti was a 7.0, killing more than 200,000 people. The quake in Chile registered 8.8, as much as 800 times stronger. The death toll less than a thousand so far. Why is that? Geography, for one thing. The Port-au-Prince quake was in shallow earth, 15 miles from the city. The Chile quake was 30 miles off the coast, deep under water. History is another factor. No one alive remembers the series of earthquakes that hit Haiti in the 1700s. But Chile's experience is much more recent; more than 28 quakes in the 20th century, including the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in 1960. All of which has led Chile to put in and adhere to strict building codes. Chile learned its lessons the hard way, making engineering the biggest factor of all that sets Chile and Haiti apart. (END VIDEO) Iraq Appoints Ambassador . AZUZ: Moving to the Middle East now. Iraq has selected an ambassador to Kuwait for the first time in two decades. Here's some background on this for you: Kuwait borders Iraq to the south. And in August of 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. That led to ""Operation Desert Storm;"" part of the Gulf War, when a U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait from Iraq in 1991. Iraq was controlled by Saddam Hussein back then. And since he was removed from power in 2003, Iraq and Kuwait have been building ties. This week's announcement is the latest step in that process. I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a government agency that dates back to colonial times. I was first run by Benjamin Franklin. According to my unofficial motto, ""neither snow nor rain nor heat"" will keep my couriers from delivering the mail. I'm the U.S. Postal Service, and my funding doesn't come from tax dollars, only from the money my business makes. Postal Service Delivery . AZUZ: That business isn't doing so well. At the end of last September, the Postal Service was $10 billion in debt! And the agency says it could lose more than $200 billion in the next 10 years unless it is allowed to make some changes. This is why we say ""allowed"": The Post Office is an independent agency, but Congress controls how it does business. And lawmakers would have to approve some of the changes that the Post Office is considering. Among those, no more mail delivery on Saturdays. Plus, the service would look to close some branches and raise some of its prices. The postmaster general, the man who runs the Post Office, says that it'll take a big effort to turn things around. JOHN POTTER, U.S. POSTMASTER GENERAL: If we make the changes that are necessary, we can continue to provide universal service for America for decades to come. But there are some very significant changes that are gonna have to be made to the service that we offer and to the way we conduct our business on a daily basis. GM Recalls . AZUZ: Recalls: We've heard about a lot of those recently. Now, American carmaker General Motors, GM, is making a recall that affects 1.3 million vehicles in the U.S, Canada and Mexico. The problem: a potential failure in the cars' power steering. GM started investigating this problem more than a year ago. The company says it develops over time, so it's more likely to affect vehicles that have been driven 20,000 to 30,000 miles. GM says it's working on a solution to all of this. In the meantime, a company spokesman says the recall is ""the right thing to do for our customers' peace of mind."" Shoutout .

The world's fastest train zooms through China at well over 200 miles per hour. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Railway Expansion . AZUZ: With the largest population in the world -- 1.3 billion people -- China is making a huge investment in helping those folks get around the country by rail. Now, trains might sound kind of old school; you might think stagecoaches or something like that. But modern railways pollute less than planes; they're far faster than cars. Building them takes money, though. And in China's case, we're talking about stimulus money. Emily Chang reports from the railways. (BEGIN VIDEO) EMILY CHANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT, BEIJING: Beijing's newest train station looks like a modern airport, and a ride on its bullet train is nearly as fast as taking a plane. China's high-speed trains have come a long way from the steam engines that once chugged into the capital before economic reforms in the 1980s transformed long-distance transportation. This is how the majority of people travel across China. Old trains like this go as slow as 55 kilometers per hour. When it's crowded, it's standing room only and the journey can take days. But that's no longer the only option. China is now home to the world's fastest train, hurtling from Wuhan to Guangzhou at more than 350 kilometers per hour. This train is so fast, it's threatened airline ticket sales. China Southern Airlines is struggling to compete on this particular route as high-speed railways change the way Chinese people travel across this vast country. China is spinning a web of high-speed railways with faster connections than ever before. The government plans to extend 3,000 current kilometers of high-speed track to 12,000 by 2012. Estimated cost: $360 billion U.S., or 60% of the stimulus package China enacted to combat the financial crisis. JOHN GONG, CHINA ECONOMICS EXPERT: If you're investing in a high-speed railway system, you're sending checks to two million workers that are involved in the railway industry. So, that's a very easy call to make, politically. CHANG: China's rail system is now arguably the most advanced in the world. U.S. company General Electric is collaborating with Beijing on technology to modernize America's own aging rail network. While nowhere close to China's investment, President Obama has committed $8 billion to high-speed rail. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains. CHANG: Just like interstate highways transformed the United States, faster trains in China will bring infrastructure, investment and passengers to destinations deep in the countryside. Critics counter China is overbuilding and that tickets on fast trains are too expensive for average citizens. But with living standards rising, more and more will be able and willing to pay to satisfy the need for speed. Emily Chang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO) Women's History Month .

"(CNN) -- Bob ""Doctor"" Lee is known for his smooth soul and classic R&B during the overnight hours, but working while many of us are sleeping takes its toll. The Harlem radio DJ says he enjoys carrying his listeners through the night, but sometimes he finds himself dozing off. ""When you're working these types of hours, sometimes you have to get some shut-eye when you can,"" Lee said. ""I go down to the gym to one of those mats, put your head back, next thing you know (laughs) you've picked up a couple minutes of sleep."" He isn't alone. In the next ""In Focus"" series from CNN's award-winning photojournalists, we're introduced to people who are awake and working the night shift while the rest of us are asleep. It's a slice of life that many people don't see -- and a different angle on news about jobs and the economy. The on-air and online project also looks at the effect night shift work has on lives, health and families. Lynette Slaton, a mother of three, has worked third shift for years as the night manager at Amy's Bread in New York. The hours are hard on her and her family, but she is determined to provide a better life for them. Slaton stays up with her children during the day so she can have a hand in raising them. ""When I look at them I want them to have so much, but right now, with the way the economy is and everything, I just feel more secure being able to be with them and not having to put them in a day care setting so young,"" she said. Watch Slaton at work as a baker, and as a parent . The series also takes us behind the scenes of Atlanta, Georgia's, Philips Arena, where workers race against the clock overnight to convert the professional sports arena from the home of the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers to the NBA's Atlanta Hawks when the teams have back-to-back games. See how the Philips team turns ice into wood . ""The games end at 9:30 at night,"" said Richard Manley, the arena's assistant manager of conversion. ""We're starting at 10 o'clock. We change this building over every night from hockey to basketball to hockey."" ""This is what we call the third shift, the night shift,"" said Barry Henson, the arena's vice president of building and event operations. ""When everybody else is asleep, this is when this building can change from one thing to the next."" CNN's Tom Foreman hosts this special series from a virtual environment designed by the graphics team at CNN's Washington Bureau.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz, and today, CNN Student News is taking you to school! Middle school, high school, college: all of them in today's show. First up, though, we're heading to the hill. First Up: Toyota Hearings . AZUZ: Capitol Hill, where a House committee is holding hearings on Toyota recalls. Yesterday, the company's president, Akio Toyoda, explained what he thinks is the reason for some of the company's recent problems. AKIO TOYODA, TOYOTA PRESIDENT: Toyota has, for the past few years, been expanding its business rapidly. Quite frankly, I fear the pace at which we have grown may have been too quick. I would like to point out here that Toyota's priority has traditionally been the following: first, safety; second, quality; third, volume. These priorities became confused, and we were not able to stop, think and make improvements as much as we were able to before. And our basic stance to listen to customers' voices to make better products has weakened somewhat. AZUZ: Mr. Toyoda says he's committed to restoring his company's reputation. Some people have blamed the U.S. government for not acting sooner. But Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says that is not the case. RAY LAHOOD, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: We haven't been sitting around on our hands. When people complain, we investigate. When there needs to be a recall, we do it. Of the 100 investigations NHTSA opens in an average year, there are currently 44 open defect investigations, 5 of which involve Toyota. Every step of the way, NHTSA officials have pushed Toyota to take corrective action so that consumers would be safe. Economic Outlook . AZUZ: Meantime, a different committee was hearing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's outlook on the country's economy. Bernanke heads up the nation's central bank. He says the U.S. economy is getting better, but he doesn't expect it to grow too much this year; only about 3 to 3.5 percent. He's also worried about the job market. Bernanke says it's still very weak. Unemployment is around 9.7 percent. He predicts that'll drop to around 7 percent, but not until the end of 2012. That statistic might get some help from a new jobs bill being considered by Congress. The Senate approved a $15 billion version yesterday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called it a ""small but important step"" in trying to pass a jobs bill. But some critics say the Senate's proposal wouldn't do nearly enough. Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... nor'easter (noun) a type of storm with extremely strong winds, which can produce heavy rain and cause powerful waves . Nor'easter . AZUZ: A nor'easter is what's on the radar for parts of the U.S. Experts think it could bring rain, snow, heavy winds. And these are areas that have already been hammered by severe winter weather. As you might guess, a nor'easter affects the northeast part of the country. But that's not where the name comes from. Chad Myers has that answer. CHAD MYERS, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: Carl, we'll talk about nor'easter because of the way the wind comes in with the storm. The wind literally comes from the Northeast. We talk about winds; we talk about a West wind. A West wind comes from the West. A Northeast wind comes from the Northeast. And that's the storm, that's the wind that picks up all the moisture and dumps it right here in the form of snow across New England, New York state and Pennsylvania. Some spots, before this all stops, with blizzard-like conditions, will have 24-36 inches of snow. Another big storm for the Northeast, and people digging out again, Carl. Hero Teacher . AZUZ: Thanks, Chad. David Benke is being hailed as a hero. He's a math teacher who tackled a gunman who opened fire at a middle school on Tuesday. The suspect is in custody. Two students were wounded in the attack. They were both treated at a nearby hospital. All this happened at Deer Creek Middle School in Littleton, Colorado. That is the same town where, eleven years ago, two gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School. After that incident, many schools across the nation, maybe even yours, started having emergency drills. Mr. Benke says that a promise he made during those led to his actions yesterday. DAVID BENKE, DEER CREEK MIDDLE SCHOOL MATH TEACHER: Whenever we had had these drills and whenever we had worked with students, I said basically, if something happens and there is something I can do about it, I want to try and do something about it. Webcam Spying? AZUZ: Around the U.S., technology is being used to help education. Some schools let you take laptops home. One Pennsylvania high school included a security measure to protect against the computers being stolen. But a student at the school says the way the technology was used was a violation of his privacy. Randy Kaye has the details on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is high school sophomore Blake Robbins. His school issued him and more than 2,000 other students laptops for their studies. What the students and families didn't know was that school officials had installed software that could turn on the laptop's camera without notice, without warning and watch them. Before Blake knew it, he found himself in the assistant principal's office at Pennsylvania's Harriton High School, accused, he says, of pushing drugs. BLAKE ROBBINS, HARRITON HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE: I couldn't say anything because she was accusing me of selling drugs. I couldn't fight back, but I thought that this was terrible, how could they do this? HOLLY ROBBINS, BLAKE'S MOM: She said that she had pictures of Blake that were taken on his computer of him holding up little, what she thought were pills. KAYE: How could the school have seen what Blake was doing? We set up a web camera in our office to show you how this all works. This is my laptop and it has a web camera built in to it. That tiny hole right there? That's the camera. So, all anyone has to do, whether they're sitting a few feet away or maybe even hundreds of miles away, is click a button to record everything I'm doing in front of this web camera. That's exactly what Blake's parents say the school district did. They say the school remotely accessed his computer without his knowledge and snapped a photo of him. Blake's family is suing. H. ROBBINS: It was an invasion of privacy; it was as if we had a Peeping Tom in our house. KAYE: The FBI is investigating to see if wiretap or computer intrusion laws were violated. The school district says in the last fourteen months, 42 laptops were reported missing or stolen, 18 of them recovered. A spokesman for the school district told CNN they would only remotely access the laptop if it had been reported stolen or missing so they could find out who was using it. But Blake's parents say his computer had not been reported missing or stolen. If that's true, why was anyone from the school accessing the camera? The school district says these are just allegations, and ""the district never did and never would use such tactics as a basis for disciplinary action."" In fact, it insists no school administrators could even access the cameras; only two people in the technology department. A letter from the superintendent admits ""...there was no explicit notification that the laptop contained the security software. This notice should have been given and we regret that was not done."" Now, school officials say the web camera security feature has been completely disabled. As for Blake and those so-called ""pills"" he says the school thought he was holding on camera, his mom claims they were candy! (END VIDEO) Tuition Soars . AZUZ: All right. We've covered a story about a middle school about a high school; it's time for college. Getting there might take more money than ever before. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: The cost of going to college is skyrocketing. The University of California expects to raise tuition by 30 percent for the 2010-2011 school year. Of course, it's in a state that has a $20 billion budget deficit. But this increase in college costs is something that's expected nationwide. From Washington state to Nevada to Florida, public universities are estimating hikes of between 10 and 15 percent. The reason: What else? The recession. Public schools get some of their money from states. States have less money to give, since they're already in debt. So, schools have to make up their deficits by charging students more. It's still a lot less expensive to attend a public college, though. Average cost this school year for a public university: around $7,000. For a private school: more than $26,000. What's interesting about all this is that there's still more demand for education; college enrollment continues to climb. For schools, that could be good news: They'll be likely to get more of the money they need. For students, well, there's always financial aid, student loans, and the value of a college degree. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, a story that might warm your heart, and your toes, and the toes of about 200 other people. It is the world's longest blanket! This thing just keeps on going. More than 450 feet long! It's on display in Oregon right now. That's where it was made. Then, the behemoth blanket will weave its way around the country. And finally, it'll either be sold or divvied up and donated to charity. Goodbye . AZUZ: We wish there was more to tell you, but that pretty much covers it. Back tomorrow.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Sales of the flu drug Relenza shot up 1,900 percent from a year ago as governments around the world stockpiled in preparation for a swine flu pandemic, drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said Wednesday. Stocks of antiviral treatments are pictured at a warehouse in an undisclosed location in the UK . Relenza sales were £60 million ($98.4 million) in the second quarter of this year, compared to £3 million ($4.9 million) in the same quarter last year, the company said in announcing its Q2 results. Glaxo also said that by the end of the year, it expects to have an annual production capacity for Relenza of 190 million treatment courses, more than a threefold increase to its previously announced maximum capacity. The company will achieve it by increasing production of the Relenza Diskhaler inhaler and building new capacity to manufacture Relenza Rotacaps, Glaxo said.  Watch as swine flu boosts drug profits » . Relenza is an antiviral medication similar to Tamiflu that treats symptoms of the flu and helps to prevent getting it. GlaxoSmithKline started production last month of a vaccine for swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus, the company said. It is now on track to meet the orders placed by many governments and the World Health Organization for the vaccine, Glaxo said. ""To date we have contracts in place to supply 195 million doses of the vaccine,"" Chief Executive Andrew Witty said. ""We also have a variety of agreements in place with the U.S. government to supply pandemic products worth $250 million. Discussions with over 50 governments are ongoing, with many at advanced stages, and I therefore expect further significant orders. Shipments are expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010."" In an interview with CNN's Richard Quest, Witty said the new swine flu vaccine will likely be a boost to sales into 2010. ""As we go forward, I think we'll see (swine flu) become more material for the company, particularly as we move into (the fourth quarter) of this year and vaccine shipments begin,"" he said. However, he thinks any sales boost from the planned swine flu vaccine will last only as long as the threat. ""What we're doing here is responding to government needs, where they've said, `Look, we don't know how serious this is going to be but we want to be prepared',"" he said. The real challenge for pharmaceutical companies is coming up with new blockbuster drugs for chronic disease, not acute outbreaks like swine flu. ""I think what you see in our industry is relatively resistant to the economic downdrafts ... but we do need to constantly renew our portfolio -- that's the challenge we face."" Glaxo will donate supplies of both the swine flu vaccine and Relenza to the WHO for use in developing countries, he said. Australian company CSL announced this week it planned to start the first human trials of a swine flu vaccine in Australia.  Watch vaccine being tested » . Participants will receive two shots three weeks apart and will undergo blood tests to determine if they are generating an appropriate immune response to the virus, the company said. Swine flu has spread so rapidly and extensively around the globe that the WHO said Monday it was changing tactics against the virus, including stopping a tally of cases and focusing on unusual patterns. WHO declared the virus a global pandemic on June 11. More than 120 countries have reported cases of human infection, totaling more than 98,000 documented cases worldwide. More than 700 people have died of the virus, the organization said Tuesday. With 29 deaths and a huge rise in the number of cases, Britain has the worst swine flu figures in Europe. Cases of swine flu in Britain have, however, proven to be generally mild in most people, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Wednesday. They have been severe only among a small minority, mostly where patients have had underlying health problems, he said. ""Robust plans are in place"" to deal with the pandemic, Brown said. By the end of the week, a new National Pandemic Flu Service will be operating in England to quickly diagnose people who have swine flu and allow them to get antiviral treatment directly from local providers, Brown said. Swine flu has spread so rapidly and extensively around the globe that the WHO is changing tactics against the H1N1 virus, including stopping a tally of cases and focusing on unusual patterns. ""At this point, further spread of the pandemic, within affected countries and to new countries, is considered inevitable,"" the WHO said. The counting of all cases is no longer essential because it is exhausting countries' resources, the organization said. While most patients have reported mild symptoms, a rise in severe symptoms or respiratory ailments that require hospitalization should be cause for concern, it said. Governments should also pay attention to unusual patterns linked to fatal cases, the WHO said. Any changes in prevailing patterns should be flagged, including a rise in school and job absenteeism, and an increase in visits to the emergency room. An overwhelmed health system may mean there is a rise in severe cases, the organization said.","NEW: CEO: Boost from swine flu vaccine will likely increase profits later this year .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: You're at the beginning of a new month, a new week and a new day of commercial-free headlines from CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Chile Earthquake . AZUZ: Safety and food: top priorities in Chile after the country was jolted by a massive earthquake over the weekend. It struck very early Saturday morning when most people were sleeping. It registered a magnitude of 8.8; very powerful. A scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey says it released about 500 times more energy than the quake that hit Haiti in January. More than 90 aftershocks have been recorded in Chile, many of those pretty powerful in their own right. The damage: tremendous. As of yesterday evening, the quake was being blamed for more than 700 deaths. It affected 2 million people, caused serious damage to around half a million homes. Chile's president called it an ""unthinkable disaster."" She declared a ""state of catastrophe"" in some regions that were hardest hit. State of catastrophe meaning that government aid is available; it's going to get to victims as fast as they can get it to them. However, the president also pointed out the recovery efforts will take quite a while. PRESIDENT MICHELLE BACHELET, CHILE (TRANSLATED): We see the size and the dimension of this catastrophe is going to require a gigantic effort from the private and public sectors, not only now, but it's going to take us a long time in the future. We are in front of an emergency that has no point of reference in the past of Chile, in Chile's history. AZUZ: As you can see on this map coming up right here, Chile is a long country. It runs down the western side of South America, along the Pacific Ocean. It's home to about 16 and a half million people. And the coastal region actually has a history of earthquakes. Since 1973, there have been 13 quakes there with a magnitude of at least 7.0. Because of that, experts say that newer buildings are built to help withstand the shocks. So, while the devastation caused by this quake is certainly severe, it's part of the reason why it might not be as bad as what we saw in Haiti. However, the effects of this tremor were felt far away. In fact, the entire Pacific was under a tsunami warning; large waves that form in the ocean. They can be triggered by earthquakes. The warning for the tsunami, later canceled for all countries.  But listen to this: Hawaii, Australia and Japan, locations that are thousands of miles away from Chile, all experienced waves that were triggered by this quake. Northeast Snowstorm . AZUZ: Heavy snow was the big story in the northeastern U.S. over the weekend again. This is the third major storm to hit the area in a month. And over the course of February, New York City set a new, all-time record for snowfall. This storm knocked out power to about 700,000 homes and businesses around the Northeast. That includes almost 225,000 in New York alone. According to one meteorologist, another round of severe winter weather could be coming this week. Is this Legit? PAUL CHAMBERS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? A term in the U.S. House of Representatives lasts four years. Nope! A House term is two years, which means all 435 voting members are up for election this year. Election Expectations . AZUZ: That election's coming up this November; campaign season has begun. Democrats currently control both the House and Senate. And here's what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted about her party's election chances: . REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) CALIFORNIA, HOUSE SPEAKER: The Democrats will retain the majority in the House of Representatives. I'm not yielding one grain of sand. We're fighting for every seat, but we are ready. AZUZ: Meantime, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about Republican chances: . SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) KENTUCKY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Obviously, we're optimistic. But in the meantime, we need to be doing the people's business and not trying to predict what the environment may be in November. If the election were today, we'd have a very good day. AZUZ: And here's what registered voters said in a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll: 63 percent felt that most members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected; 34 percent said they do. SeaWorld Show . AZUZ: SeaWorld shows with orca, or killer, whales are back on again. The shows were suspended for three days after an accident involving one of the animals at the Orlando SeaWorld. It claimed the life of a trainer, Dawn Brancheau. The theme park, as well as two government agencies, are looking into this accident. Meantime, SeaWorld is putting new policies in place with regard to how trainers interact with the whales. Hundreds of people attended the orca show in Orlando on Saturday, the first one since the accident. It began with a tribute to Brancheau and a standing ovation for her fellow trainers. Some of the visitors who were there for the show talked about the experience. UNIDENTIFIED MALE #1: I think it was great that they moved forward. I wished they would have said a little bit more, actually, about it, what had happened and what was going to happen. Because obviously everyone there was anxious and curious about what the future is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE #2: It wasn't a happy atmosphere. We all stood up for the remembrance and we cheered the trainers. This Day in History . [GRAPHIC] Salem Witch Trials -- Incident involved accusations of witchcraft. First charges issued on March 1, 1692. In all, 150 people imprisoned; 19 convicted and hanged. [GRAPHIC] Peace Corps -- Established by President John F. Kennedy March 1, 1961. Promotes world peace and friendship. Volunteers work in developing countries. Nearly 200,000 volunteers and trainees to date. Record Setting Medals . AZUZ: And some more history being made in Vancouver as the U.S. racks up the most medals ever by one country in a Winter Olympics. 37 total medals, when you add up gold, silver and bronze. This also marks the first time since 1932 that the U.S. has been first place in the overall medal count at a Winter Games. Adopt a Tiger? AZUZ: All right, our next story today is about owning a cat; it's not so unusual. Some people might have a chance to adopt a rare breed, though, thanks to a plan being considered by Indonesia. The thing is, these cats weigh up to 500 pounds! That's 'cause they're tigers! And all you need to get one is a big chunk of money. As Arwa Damon explains, some people are concerned about the consequences of this. (BEGIN VIDEO) ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, JAKARTA: Ever dream of owning a tiger? If you are in Indonesia, it just might be possible. These Sumatran tigers at the safari park outside of Jakarta could soon be up for adoption. It's part of a conservation initiative the government is considering. For a $100,000 deposit, ordinary citizens would be allowed to care for a pair of these critically endangered wild cats in their own backyard, as long as it's at least a tenth the size of a football field. DARORI, INDONESIAN DIRECTOR GENERAL, FOREST PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION [TRANSLATED]: We hope that this program will help to eradicate poaching, because in Indonesia or abroad, a lot of people want to have tigers as pets. But because it's illegal, they go and buy dead tigers. DAMON: With this option, Darori says, the ones in the wild will be left alone. Illegal poaching and an 80 percent loss of tiger habitat in Sumatra has caused their numbers in the wild to dwindle down to a few hundred. These guys do look like they would make absolutely adorable pets right now. But they're not going to stay this small or this cuddly for long. Officials are saying that they do believe that this program will be successful, because it's based on a similar initiative that they launched earlier for the Balinese mynah bird that was on the verge of extinction. Problem is, caring for a bird the size of a pidgeon and caring for a tiger, not exactly the same thing. Now, they are very small. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE TIGER KEEPER: Yes, very small. DAMON: In nine months, they will be this big. With big appetites. The keepers were all stunned to hear that their tigers could end up as household pets. The keepers here go through a rigorous training program, Arsyad explains. The government says it's planning on assigning keepers to each pair that is adopted. Conservationists say animals like these belong in the wild, not as a backyard symbol of prestige. Arwa Damon, CNN, Bogor, Indonesia. (END VIDEO) Blog Promo . AZUZ: Under consideration in Utah: an optional senior year; letting high school students graduate as juniors.

Field trips canceled? Bigger class sizes? Tell us at CNNStudentNews.com. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, you better watch your mouth! Especially if you live in California. What the... ?!?

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Molly Bish's father has often said that it probably took only eight minutes for his 16-year-old daughter to be abducted. Molly Bish was 16 and working as a lifeguard when she disappeared. Her remains were found three years later. It took three years before a hunter found her body, five miles away. Her tattered bathing suit was found with her scattered bones. It has taken nearly nine years for investigators to come close to a break in the case. Molly Bish worked as a lifeguard at Comins Pond in Warren, Massachusetts. Her mother, Magi Bish, saw a man in a white car as she dropped Molly off on the morning of June 27, 2000. She waved goodbye as she drove off. It was the last time Magi Bish would see her daughter alive. Shortly after 10 a.m., another mother arrived at the beach with her children in tow. She found Molly's backpack, lifeguard chair and beach towel. Her first-aid kit was wide open on a bench. But Molly was nowhere to be seen. Molly's worried boss called police a few hours later. They mounted the largest missing persons search in Massachusetts history. There was no sign of her. ""Molly would never have abandoned her job or her post of her own accord,"" said her sister, Heather Bish. John and Magi Bish slowly began to realize that Molly must have been abducted. Magi Bish couldn't get the man in the white car out of her mind. He gave her an uneasy feeling when she dropped off Molly. She even waited until he drove away before she left herself. The worried mother gave police a detailed description. Investigators released composite sketches of a dark-haired man with salt-and-pepper hair in his late 40s. A man in custody for another case closely resembles the composite sketch, family members say. ""Over the years, there have been many persons of interest and leads, but nothing as promising as this one,"" Heather Bish said. Authorities have questioned this man. Massachusetts State Police and the Worcester County District Attorney's office aren't ready to name him a suspect. But he is in jail, the prime suspect in his girlfriend's slaying. ""We questioned (him) about the Bish case based on a tip. We get hundreds of tips and we investigate and follow up on all of them,"" said Timothy Connelly, spokesperson for the Worcester County District Attorney. Connelly would not comment on what the man told investigators. He grew up in the Warren area, his former wife said. She added that he lived neaby in Southbridge until shortly after Molly disappeared. Then he sold his house and moved to Florida with the girlfriend he's now accused of stabbing and decapitating. The man often hunted and fished near Comins Pond, his family and friends said. His brother owned a white Chrysler similar to the car that Molly's mother saw on the day she disappeared, said the man's ex-wife. ""This is one of the first real leads we've had in a long time that makes sense and I am very hopeful it's the break we've been looking for,"" said Tom Shamshak, a private investigator hired by the Bish family. Shamshak added that investigators have been trying to find the man's brother, who owned the white car. Police urge anyone having any information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for Molly Bish's death to please call their tip line at 508-832-9124.","Lifeguard Molly Bish, 16, disappeared on June 27, 2000 .

"(CNN) -- Tar balls believed to be from the undersea gusher in the Gulf of Mexico have reached the shores of Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain, a foundation that monitors the watershed reported Monday. The area affected covers a stretch of up to five miles near the city of Slidell, northeast of New Orleans, said Anne Rheams, executive director of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation. She estimated the amount of oil that has reached the lake at less than 100 barrels, with no hydrocarbon smell. ""They are about the size of a silver dollar, maybe a little bigger, kind of dispersed in long intervals. It's not as dense as it could be, so we're thankful for that,"" Rheams said. Cleanup crews had collected more than a half-ton of the tar balls -- 1,020 pounds -- by Monday evening, and the oil will be tested to confirm it came from the undersea well that has been spewing into the Gulf since April, the Joint Information Center in Houma said Monday night. But Rheams told CNN, ""They've got to be from the spill."" Tar balls had previously been spotted in Rigolets Pass, which connects the lake with Mississippi Sound. Officials in Orleans and St. Tammany parishes have been using heavy booms, barges and skimmers to defend Pontchartrain since the early days of the disaster, but Rheams said high waves and strong easterly and southeasterly winds have complicated the effort. ""The main thing is that they are an indicator that it could be coming more so this way,"" she said. State officials have closed a swath of the southern part of the 630-square-mile lake to fishing following the discovery, but there was no sign of impact to wildlife as of Monday, Rheams said. The Coast Guard reported Sunday that a shift in weather patterns could send more oil toward sensitive shores in Mississippi and Louisiana, and bad weather over the past few days has significantly hampered cleanup efforts. Rheams said that pattern was expected to persist for at least three more days. Federal officials have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels (1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been spewing into the Gulf daily since April 20, when the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in about 40 miles off the Louisiana coast. Efforts to plug the gusher have so far failed, and oil from the spill has been reported as far east as the central Florida Panhandle.","Dispersed, weathered oil reaches Lake Pontchartrain .

"(CNN) -- South Korea's prime minister has offered to resign, his  communications office said Monday, after failure to win parliamentary  approval to stop relocation of  government offices out of the  capital, Seoul. Prime Minister Chung Un-chan verbally offered to resign, but President Lee Myung-bak did not accept his offer, the office said. Chung offered to resign after failure to win the parliamentary approval, a major setback to Lee's government and a sign that his party is losing clout. The president's Grand National Party has taken a beating in local elections, which analysts see as a referendum on his handling of the Cheonan incident. The South Korean naval ship Cheonan sank March 26 in disputed waters.  The loss of the ship and 46 sailors raised tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has vehemently denied charges it fired a torpedo that sank the Cheonan. CNN's Roya Shadravan contributed to this report.","South Korea's prime minister offers to resign .

"(CNN) -- Call David X. Cohen a nerd all you like, but never call him a geek. To the co-creator of ""Futurama,"" the term ""nerd"" is a compliment. ""I feel like with 'nerd culture,' [it sounds like] the nerds have triumphed,"" he said. 'Geek' has a negative connotation. I'd rather be called a nerd. I love being called a nerd."" Back in 2003, this particular nerd couldn't believe it was all over for ""Futurama."" ""When we were canceled by Fox, we thought that was it,"" Cohen recalled. ""We really didn't have any expectations at the time. It was really emotional because we spent four years locked in a dark room working on the show. I went on with my life and wrote a couple of pilots."" As the years went by, the network Adult Swim (a Time Warner property, along with CNN) started airing reruns of ""Futurama"" along with ""Family Guy."" ""Family Guy's"" ratings and DVD sales convinced Fox to give it a second chance, and the rest is history. ""Futurama's"" ratings were similarly high, and once ""Family Guy"" started putting feature-length episodes on DVD, a light bulb went off in Cohen's head. "" 'Family Guy' blazed the trail with direct-to-DVD movies and got back on the air,"" he said. ""We called Fox and told them every six months that, hey, 'Futurama' is even more fitting for direct-to-DVD."" Finally, in 2007, fans had their ""Futurama"" back, in not one, but four direct-to-DVD movies. As a result of those sales, Comedy Central is starting a new season of the show on Thursday night. The first order of business: wrapping up what happened at the end of the last movie, when Fry, Leela, Bender and the rest of the crew were sucked into a wormhole. ""Our first episode is 'Rebirth,' which is metaphorical but a surprisingly literal term -- our crew members are going to suffer some serious physical harm,"" Cohen explained. ""Not for the squeamish, necessarily, but we will see the rebirth process as science has it in the year 3000."" The most exciting new thing about this season of ""Futurama,"" according to Cohen, is that it's, well, new. ""I want to reassure our fans that this will be the real classic 'Futurama' back to its original form. They supported us, and we want to repay them."" For fans who are probably wondering what happened between Fry and Leela, last seen kissing before that climactic trip, Cohen said their questions will be answered, all in good time: ""We're going to be dealing with the surprising sci-fi consequences of that relationship."" Former Vice President Al Gore will also provide his voice, once again, just in time for the holidays. ""The holiday special's going to focus on the future versions of Christmas, Kwanzaa and 'Robanukah,' which Bender made up to get off of work. Gore will make his record-breaking fourth guest appearance,"" Cohen said. ""We will have the classic pairing of Gore and Coolio, making his third appearance, playing Kwanzaa-bot."" ""Futurama"" also has a big milestone to celebrate, thanks to that Comedy Central pickup: ""We will have our 100th episode with Mark Mothersbaugh and Devo. Leela leads the mutant people who live under the sewers in an uprising against the surface people."" iReporters love Futurama . So what kind of brain power does it take to write a show with so many jokes revolving around nerdy topics? ""My master's degree [in physics and theoretical computer science] puts me in the middle of the pack -- we have had three science PhDs in our writers room, so no one is impressed with my master's degree,"" Cohen joked. ""We do sneak in a high-level math or physics equation, and we know few people get them, but they are hidden in the background, and we'll reward a few viewers and hopefully make them lifelong 'Futurama' fans."" One example of such nerdy humor will actually come to the forefront in the near future. ""Our tenth episode of the new season is written by Dr. Ken Keeler, and it involves the characters switching minds, and it becomes very complicated due to the nature of this to work our way back to the original body, and requires solving a mathematical problem,"" Cohen explained. ""Ken actually proved a theorem critical to resolving the episode. We're going to present a 'Futurama' theorem."" Cracking jokes and breaking new scientific ground at the same time? Fans of ""Futurama,"" nerdy or otherwise, wouldn't want it any other way.","Seven years after being canceled by Fox, ""Futurama"" is back -- on Comedy Central .

"(CNN) -- One look at her photo, and you can't help but ask: How could someone so young and vibrant die so quickly from an infection? Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died from a sepsis infection. Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa was a healthy 20-year-old when doctors told her she had a urinary tract infection, her family says. The infection spread, and after amputating her feet, doctors thought they had the situation under control, according to a blog run by a family friend. ""She's alive, [she] will survive,"" Renato Lindgren wrote on the blog on January 20, before da Costa also had to have her hands amputated, and part of her stomach and both kidneys extracted. ""She can eat well, visit the sea, swim, travel, talk with her friends and family, marry and have a baby. She has a full and beautiful life ahead."" Four days later, da Costa was dead. Sepsis -- the body's inflammatory response to an infection -- really can kill that quickly, according to Dr. Kevin Tracey, author of a book about sepsis called ""Fatal Sequence: The Killer Within."" ""This isn't a one in a million case,"" says Tracey, chief executive officer of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York. ""When an infection reaches a certain point, this can happen in a matter of hours."" Sepsis usually starts out as an infection in just one part of the body, such as a skin wound or a urinary tract infection, Tracey says. For example, Muppets creator Jim Henson died in 1990 from a case of sepsis that started out as pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs. He was 53. Most of the time, simple, localized infections remain just that: easy to treat and in one part of the body. Why some infections rage out of control and shut down vital organs is a mystery, but experts say it rarely happens in young, healthy people, like da Costa.  Watch more on avoiding septicemia » . ""You can ask, 'Why her?' but really no one knows why her,"" Tracey says. ""It might have something to do with her immune system. It might be about her genetics."" The Mayo Clinic sees about 100 cases a year of young, healthy people who develop sepsis, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at Mayo. With treatment, which usually involves antibiotics and sometimes draining of the wound, about 75 percent survive. Sampathkumar says the key is to keep an eye on even such simple infections as a small skin wound. A fever, a dramatic shift in blood pressure, rapid breathing and extreme confusion are all signs that someone needs quick medical help, she says. ""You need to watch it,"" she says. Dr. Carl Flatley said he had no idea what to watch for when his 23-year-old daughter, Erin, developed sepsis in 2002. He says she went into the hospital for a minor hemorrhoid procedure and five days later was dead from sepsis. ""It's a horrible death,"" he says. Two years later, knowing the signs of sepsis saved his own life, says Flatley, a dentist in Dunedin, Florida. He fell ill, and an emergency room doctor said he had a urinary tract infection and sent him home. But Flatley said he suspected it was much more than a UTI. ""I felt very sick. My testicle was sore. I told him I was concerned I had sepsis and I refused to go home. He got very irritated with me,"" Flatley says. But in the end, Flatley was admitted to the hospital, where the infection had become so severe that doctors were forced to remove his right testicle. Flatley started The Sepsis Alliance to educate others about sepsis, where he tries to walk a fine line. ""You don't want to panic people. We all get infections and, thank God, most of them heal,"" he says. ""So this is what I tell people: If you're feeling bad all over and have a high temperature and either high or low blood pressure, those are all indications that your whole system has been infected. It could be sepsis."" He advises getting medical help immediately, and to specifically mention that you're concerned you might have sepsis. ""You don't want to take any chances,"" he says. CNN's Jennifer Pifer-Bixler and Sabriya Rice and CNN Español's Cibele Lorenzoni contributed to this report.","Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa, 20,  died after sepsis infection spread .

"JONESTOWN, Guyana (CNN) -- Cyanide was being bought and shipped to the Rev. Jim Jones' jungle compound in South America for at least two years before 909 Americans died there at the command of their cult leader, CNN has learned. Sources in Guyana said the Jonestown camp began obtaining shipments of cyanide -- about a quarter to a half-pound of the deadly poison each month -- as early as 1976, well before most of Jones' followers made the move there. CNN's Soledad O'Brien tells the story of the last hours of Jonestown -- and the few who did survive out of desperation and daring -- as CNN Presents ""Escape from Jonestown."" Jones led his followers to their death after his gunmen killed a visiting congressman, Rep. Leo Ryan, and four others, including an NBC News correspondent and his cameraman, on November 18, 1978. Jones told the members of his Peoples Temple church that the Guyanese Army would invade their settlement after the murders. He demanded that parents kill their children first, then take their own lives, rather than face the authorities because of what Jones had done. Of the 909 who died, 303 were children -- from teens to toddlers. Many were killed by Jones' loyalists, who used syringes to squirt cyanide down their throats.  Jones stockpiled cyanide » . CNN was told Jones obtained a jeweler's license to buy cyanide. The chemical can be used to clean gold. But there was no jeweler's operation in Jonestown. Six months before Ryan arrived on a one-man investigative mission, the settlement's doctor wrote in a memo to Jones: . ""Cyanide is one of the most rapidly acting poisons. ... I would like to give about two grams to a large pig to see how effective our batch is."" The purchases are ""strong evidence that the Rev. Jim Jones had been plotting the death of his followers long before that fateful day,"" O'Brien reports. Ryan, the only U.S. representative assassinated in office, was shot at a nearby airstrip as he tried to leave with 15 church members who told him Jones was holding people captive in the remote jungle encampment. ""That was literally a jungle prison,"" said Gerald Parks, whose wife, Patricia, was shot to death in the airport attack.  How did he escape death? »  Four other members of his family survived, including two young daughters who were lost in the jungle for three days after running away from the airstrip to hide from the killers.  Woman returns to scene for first time » . ""It was a dictatorship,"" said Vernon Gosney, who was badly wounded in the airport shootings. ""It was supposed to be socialism, but it really was fascism."" Jones was a phony faith healer who moved his Indiana church to northern California in the mid-'60s in search of a safe place to survive the possibility of nuclear warfare. In the mid-'70s, when a magazine raised questions about church beatings and financial abuses, Jones moved his flock to Guyana, in South America, to the jungle settlement he called his ""beautiful promised land."" ""It was a slave camp run by a madman,"" said Leslie Wilson, a young mother then only 21, who began walking away from Jonestown early on the day that ended in the suicides and murder. She and 10 others trudged almost 30 miles through the jungle to another town. Wilson carried her 3-year-old son on her back. ""It was a freedom walk,"" she said. ""It was a walk to freedom."" Tim Carter, a Jones aide, stayed in the camp almost to the end and saw his wife and his 1-year-old son die before he was sent away on an errand.   Authorities made him return two days later to help identify bodies. Carter saw Jones lying with a bullet hole in the side of his head. ""I remember thinking the son of a bitch didn't even die the way everybody else died,"" Carter said.","In 1978, 909 Americans were led to mass murder-suicide by the Rev. Jim Jones .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The doctors, nurses, pharmacists and technicians gathered around her son's crib, their faces grim. Pamela Gorman knew what they were thinking: Her son, Christopher, was about to die. As a newborn, Christopher Gorman was given little chance of survival. His mom calls his recovery ""a miracle."" Christopher was just a few days old and had a rare blood infection and fungal meningitis, a brain infection. ""I could tell in their eyes they had no hope for my son,"" Gorman said. ""They told me to prepare for his death. They told me he might not make it through the night."" Gorman never believed the doctors. In fact, she did something she thinks annoyed these men and women of science: She prayed. She prayed all the time. ""They made me feel ridiculous for praying so much and so hard and leaving it up to God,"" said Gorman, who lives in Idaho Falls, Idaho. ""But I told them my son not surviving was not an option."" When he was a month old, Christopher left the hospital. He's been healthy ever since, she says. He turns 3 next month. ""It was a miracle,"" she said. ""There are just things doctors can't explain. Doctors are not in control of everything. There's stuff that happens every day that they can't explain.""  Empowered Patient: Watch more on faith and medicine » . A new study finds that many Americans have that same kind of faith. In the study, 57 percent of randomly surveyed adults said God's intervention could save a deathly ill family member even if physicians said treatment would be futile. However, just under 20 percent of doctors and other medical workers said God could reverse a helpless outcome. The study was published last month in Archives of Surgery and is one of many to show a ""faith gap"" between doctors and patients. ""Patients are scared to death to talk to their doctors about this issue,"" said Dr. Harold Koenig, co-director of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health at Duke University. Given this gap, how can you discuss God with your physician? We asked advice from Koenig and two other physicians who study faith and medicine. 1. It's OK to ask for a doctor who also has strong religious convictions . Koenig suggests this approach when talking to a physician: ""I would say: 'My religious beliefs are very important to me and influence my medical decisions and the way I cope with illness, and I want a doctor who has those same convictions. If you don't come from that perspective, do you know a doctor you can refer me to?' "" If you're a Christian, you might find a like-minded doctor through the ZIP code search at the Christian Medical and Dental Associations. 2. Don't be surprised if you find No. 1 difficult to do . ""Religion is the last taboo in medicine,"" said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, an internist, a Franciscan friar and director of ethics at St. Vincent's Hospital and New York Medical College in New York. ""Doctors and patients talk about intimate details like sexual practices and drug use but still have this great reluctance to talk about religion."" Sulmasy suggests not asking directly about the doctor's own religious beliefs but instead focusing on your own religious needs. 3. It's OK to ask your doctor to pray with you . According to a 2006 study by the University of Chicago, 53 percent of doctors surveyed said it was appropriate to pray with patients when asked. This can work even when doctor and patient don't share the same faith. For example, Koenig, who's Christian, has prayed with Jewish patients. ""In most cases, a general prayer asking for God's comfort, support and healing will be sufficient,"" he said. 4. Be specific about your religious needs . ""If I'm a Muslim and I come to the point of dying, the hospital might need to relax the visiting rules, because it's important to have as many people as possible with me as I recite the Quran,"" Sulmasy said. ""If I'm a Buddhist, it may be important to me to hear chant as I'm dying,"" he added. ""If I'm a Catholic, I may want to receive the Sacrament of the Sick."" 5. If you believe in miracles, say so . ""Get that out in the open,"" advised Dr. Robert Fine, an internist and head of clinical ethics and palliative care at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. Confusion may ensue if you don't, he explains. For example, sometimes doctors think families are against removing life support at the end of life because they don't understand the medical facts, when they do understand but are waiting for a miracle. ""Once we know that, we can have a discussion about faith,"" Fine said. CNN's Jennifer Pifer contributed to this report.","Recent study found many Americans believe in divine intervention in a medical crisis .
If faith is important to you, it's OK to ask for a doctor with similar convictions .
If you believe in miracles, make sure your health providers know it ."
"(CNN) -- Americans know Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his belligerence toward the United States and Israel and for clashes with international regulators over Iran's pursuit of nuclear technology. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's foreign policy has affected Iran's domestic economy. The conservative Ahmadinejad, 52, the former mayor of Tehran, was elected president in a landslide in June 2005, defeating centrist Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. A tighter race is expected in this Friday's presidential contest, which pits Ahmadinejad against self-described reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi and two other candidates. Ahmadinejad is expected by many to be re-elected. ""He's pretty charming. He's a little bullheaded, but he's definitely got his charms and charisma in a strange sort of way,"" said Hooman Majd, an Iranian-American writer who travels to Iran several times a year. Ahmadinejad and his wife, Parvin, have three children. Rumors that he was among the revolutionaries who held hostages at the American Embassy in Tehran from 1979 to 1981 have never been confirmed. ""He's an interesting man,"" Majd said. ""He's very smart. There's no question about that.""  Watch the intensity of the campaign » . A few months after taking office, Ahmadinejad stated during a speech at the World Without Zionism conference in Tehran that ""Israel must be wiped off the map."" In another speech two months later, he referred to the Holocaust as ""a myth"" started by Europeans. Last week at the site of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany, President Obama didn't mention Ahmadinejad by name but denounced ""those who insist that the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful."" Ahmadinejad, the son of a blacksmith and holder of a doctorate in transportation engineering, enjoys strong support among the lower classes and in smaller cities, where he has liberally disbursed government money, said Mehdi Khalaji, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He also appeals to poorly educated people who are most influenced by religious hard-liners, Khalaji said. ""Honestly, we've never seen anyone as courageous as Ahmadinejad,"" one man said at a Tehran rally this week. ""He is a true son of the Revolution,"" said another. The president's revolutionary fervor is genuine, Majd said, and it is his political bread and butter. ""There are people who support that, who like the idea of Iran maintaining that revolutionary zeal and being that revolutionary state,"" Majd said. However, even some of Ahmadinejad's supporters acknowledge that voters may be looking for a change. ""Most of the people voting for Moussavi are doing it just to get rid of Ahmadinejad,"" one woman in Tehran said.  Watch what some of the key issues are » . Many want Iran to have better relations with the West, relations that have been strained by Ahmadinejad's remarks about Israel and his refusal to submit to inspections of nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. That stance has led to isolation from the West, hampering foreign investment and limiting Iran's economic growth, a sore point with many voters. ""There's a sort of overwhelming support now for an opening up of the country to the international community and some access to the free-market economy because, frankly, Iran's own economy is on the verge of utter collapse,"" said Reza Aslan, an analyst for DailyBeast.com and author of the book ""No God But God,"" an analysis of Islam in politics and culture. Majd, who has translated for Ahmadinejad at the United Nations and who spent four of the last six weeks in Tehran, agreed. ""A less belligerent foreign policy, a slight, strategic alteration of the foreign policy, is going to bode well for Iran. That's how a lot of voters are viewing it,"" he said. The success or failure of Obama's diplomatic overtures toward Iran could hinge on Friday's election, Aslan said. ""Let's be frank. The Obama administration is going to open up to Iran regardless of who wins this election,"" Aslan said. ""But it would certainly be a lot easier, not to mention more politically palatable in the United States, if it weren't Ahmadinejad."" CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour contributed to this report.","Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad known for hostility toward U.S., Israel .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Entry-level jobs are most workers' first forays into the professional world. Few of us went from unemployed to high-ranking employee overnight. In fact, unless your family name is displayed on a skyscraper, an entry-level job is unavoidable. Although employers decide which positions in their organizations are entry-level, they usually define them as jobs requiring two years of experience or less. These positions can come with various education requirements, ranging from some schooling up to completion of a bachelor's degree, depending on the industry. In their book ""200 Best Jobs for College Graduates, 4th Edition,"" Laurence Shatkin and Michael Farr list some of the best entry-level jobs available. Shatkin and Farr looked for jobs with a high concentration of workers between 20 and 24 years old. They looked beyond what the starting salaries are and sought careers that have potential for growth and higher salaries in the future. Of course, entry-level jobs aren't merely for the early 20-somethings, so don't think the list can't apply to you if you're outside of that age range. For example, many workers are switching careers in this economy because their industry isn't thriving. Many veteran workers realize that they've spent years in the wrong field, return to school, get a degree and find themselves starting over again. Some say companies discriminate against laid-off workers . For anyone looking for an entry-level position, we wanted to make your search a little easier. We took some of the best entry-level jobs, according to Shatkin and Farr, and determined where the best salaries are offered, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Soledad O'Brien and her producers spent several weeks in New Orleans shadowing the foot soldiers charged with battling the violence and corruption that mars the city and keeps many residents from returning home three years after Hurricane Katrina. She reveals what they found in ""One Crime at a Time"" airing Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 11 p.m. ET. Ryan McClure, 23, loved the outdoors. His mother is waiting for his killer or killers to be brought to justice. NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- ""It's not a success story,"" Rhonda McClure Collins told us. Her face is pale and worn, and she's clearly working hard to contain her emotions. The 46-year-old was married this summer, following a long courtship, and this should be a joyous time for her. Instead, she is sitting in the shadows of a northwestern Louisiana hotel room, clutching a tissue and talking about the failure of the New Orleans District Attorney's Office to prosecute the two men who, she believes, murdered her son. Collins told me that her son, Ryan McClure, was a very sociable young man with a big smile and a lot of friends. She said that he loved fishing and hunting and anything else to do with the outdoors. ""He lived on a four-wheeler, and the wetter and muddier it was, the more he liked it,"" she said, her face shining with memories of her only child. McClure was 23 when New Orleans police found his body in January, slumped behind a brick wall at a high school that had been abandoned since Hurricane Katrina. For four months, Collins waited. She spoke regularly with New Orleans Homicide Det. Anthony Pardo, who leads the search for her son's killer, or killers.  Detectives often work 24-hour shifts to solve murders » . Collins told me that this April, she awoke to her phone ringing. It was Pardo. He apologized for waking her and explained that earlier in the day, he had made an arrest in her son's case. Pardo had discovered some car wheels that he believed belonged to McClure and that, along with some cell phone records and other evidence he won't discuss, led him to apply for a warrant to arrest 20-year-old John Broyard.  See photos on the frontlines of New Orleans crime fight » . CNN cameras captured Pardo and the officers that very day in April as they rushed toward a car wash on Robert E. Lee Boulevard, where Broyard was cuffed and stuffed into a police car. He was later booked in connection with McClure's death. ""What's your confidence level that your case will end in conviction of that guy?"" I asked Pardo while standing outside the car wash. ""I'm always confident, always confident. You can't not be confident. You've got to believe in what you do,"" Pardo said. Three days later, the veteran homicide detective watched with his partner, Det. Harold Wischan, as a heavily armed SWAT team rushed through a high gate and into a worn-down home to arrest 55-year-old Maxie Jones, Broyard's uncle. ""Everyone thinks the arrest is the end,"" Pardo told me. ""Actually it's the beginning. That's when you start putting the case together ... and making an airtight case."" It turns out it was the end. Broyard and Jones sat in jail for nearly 120 days, the maximum amount of time that murder suspects can be held before the New Orleans District Attorneys Office must charge or release them. A grand jury reviewed Pardo's evidence and chose not to indict either man. Why this happened exactly is a mystery. The grand jury deliberations are behind closed doors, and the D.A.'s office won't comment on cases they might represent for charges. ""He's a free man,"" Broyard's attorney, Price Quentin told CNN. The lawyer hasn't heard from his client and said, ""He's under no obligation to contact us."" Jones' attorneys haven't heard from their client either. Paul Fleming Jr. and Lee Faulkner Jr. told CNN that Jones wasn't involved in McClure's killing. Both attorneys claim he has an alibi for the night of January 5, the night police believe McClure was murdered outside John F. Kennedy High School. Pardo said he ""absolutely"" believes he arrested the right men, and can't explain why the grand jury didn't indict them. ""It's a question I can't answer. We present the cases and it goes from there,"" Pardo said. According to the district attorney's figures, four out of every 10 suspects arrested for homicide in New Orleans walk free without ever being charged. Of those cases that do go forward to prosecution, a significant portion are dismissed before ever going to trial. All of this happens in a city with the highest per capita murder rate in the country. ""All hope is not lost,"" Pardo said confidently, a few weeks after both Broyard and Jones were freed from the Orleans Parish Jail. Pardo and Wischan said they will continue to push on the McClure case. Hope and resilience is nearly everywhere you look here. We find it inside the temporary district attorney offices on Poydras Street -- the flood-damaged D.A.'s office still hasn't been repaired.  Assistant D.A.s hoping to repair tattered image » . ""I wouldn't give up being a happy homemaker, which is what I did for the last seven years, if I didn't believe in what I was doing,"" said Mary Glass, assistant district attorney. Glass has been prosecuting the city's highest priority cases since returning to the office in July 2007, and has won or gotten guilty pleas on every murder case she's tried. Her partner Tanya Faia believes, ""If you love to prosecute, you want to prosecute for people who care. And people care right now."" Faia believes that's because people want to be in New Orleans enough to return despite the crime, the slow rebuilding and limited services. We first met Anthony Pardo, Harold Wischan, Mary Glass and Tanya Faia, along with their bosses, Police Chief Warren Riley and Interim District Attorney Keva Landrum Johnson, in April, when we traveled to New Orleans to see how crime and corruption might be slowing the city's post-Katrina recovery effort. We found that around 30 percent of the population had yet to return, and the residents' fear of crime and loathing of the city's long history of corruption, were reasons why many had not moved back. After Katrina hit in August 2005, thousands of accused felons in New Orleans walked out of jail because the D.A.'s office failed to charge them before their legally mandated release dates. This helped to make many witnesses to crimes in the city extremely hesitant to cooperate with the judicial process. ""For a time, some people felt that there was not justice in the criminal justice system and you know the D.A.'s office was not convicting people but I'm here to tell you that that day is passed,"" Landrum Johnson told us in May. Indeed, when we arrived in the spring, there appeared to be a concentrated effort to focus on the violent crime and corruption that many believe fuel the city's street crime. The local-boy-turned-U.S. attorney, Jim Letten, assured me that, ""this city is going to survive. But I will tell you right now, though, the struggle for this city's recovery, its long-term survival as the New Orleans that we know, is being decided every day."" ""Can you win?"" I asked Letten. ""Yes. Yes,"" he answered, with no hesitation. Additionally, the city's new Inspector General Bob Cerasoli, like Letten, passionately believes there is a link between white collar crime and street crime. Cerasoli came to the city from Boston to uncover fraud, corruption and misappropriations. Every day, he runs into roadblocks like missing computers, a lack of supplies and non-working phone lines that keep him from quickly forming his office and doing his job. ""When I wake up in the morning, I like to say that Jesus puts my clothes on, because some mornings I don't know how I get up,"" Cerasoli told me in a thick Boston accent. ""As long as we achieve something, I think there's hope."" But it's slow going for everyone, despite the hope. Hope can't make people admit to witnessing a crime; hope can't get them to testify in court. Hope can't take the guns out of the hands of young, unsupervised, adults. And hope can't get Rhonda McClure Collins, and other mothers like her whom we meet during the course of our documentary, the justice she desires. But even Rhonda McClure Collins can't let go of all of her hope. We ask her, ""Do you have faith in the New Orleans justice system?"" She told us she doesn't, but said, ""I have faith in Detective Pardo."" And that's something.","CNN's Soledad O'Brien shadowed New Orleans crime fighters in April 2008 .

"(CNN) -- As I watched the split screen of the Petraeus hearings and the Kagan hearings this week, two views of what makes America great were clearly on display. I was transfixed by the visual image of four-star Gen. David Petraeus, sitting in dress uniform decorated with row upon row of ribbons and patches awarded in recognition for some difficult task or accomplishment. The general was given a deserved lovefest by the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The contrast was Elena Kagan, also called general (solicitor general) in her modest suit being put through a little more grueling questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Petraeus is a hero and the most celebrated active general in our armed services. Kagan is a stranger to most of the country and barely known outside the legal and political fields before her nomination. But she will now be an important part of our government and our nation's history. The most serious questioning she received was by the ranking Republican, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, who wanted to know why as dean of the Harvard Law School she had restricted military recruiters' ability to contact students on campus because of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy barring openly gay soldiers from serving. She didn't have a good answer. The honest answer would have been that many in the academic world and many in the legal world don't like our military. Assuming she is confirmed, Justice Kagan will conduct her battles behind the closed doors of the Supreme Court -- potentially for many decades -- and I assume she will be part of the liberal wing of the court. Her battles will be with words and opinions, not bullets. Petraeus' battlefield will be more public and certainly more difficult. The Petraeus hearing was pro forma. The explanation to his wife about why he was going back to war and moving from Tampa, Florida, to Kabul, Afghanistan, probably took longer than it did for the Senate to confirm him. Petraeus is doing this because his president asked him to and because he is a soldier and a patriot. But there was a mixed message coming out of Petraeus' hearing. The message was: We love you general, we hate your war. His message back was: Let me go fight it as best I know how and don't handicap my fighters by artificial deadlines or restrictions. After nine years of battle, Americans are tired of war. Don't think for a moment that our soldiers, from generals on down, aren't pretty tired of it, too. The generals and the soldiers didn't start these wars. It's important that Americans remember who created the first battlefields and struck the first blows against us at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon itself. These were the first battlefields on our soil since the Civil War. One of the bravest of these generals, is Stanley McChrystal, who announced this week he will retire shortly from the Army. A little over a year ago, he also sat in a decorated uniform before that same Armed Services Committee. It's notable that while this great man attracted wide public attention by the manner in which he's leaving the Army after 34 years of service to his country, few will ever know what he did and the dangers he has encountered. Most of his military career has been in special operations, the clandestine fighting that is not reported. Much of his service and his accomplishments remain classified including his tour of duty from 2003 to 2008 as commander of the Joint Special Operations Command. This elite unit of Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Green Berets and Delta forces was so covert that the Pentagon refused to acknowledge it existed. It was composed of a very few of the best fighting forces we had, and its mission was finding terrorists and eliminating them. I would think that, in a war with terrorists, that's what you want your side to do. In the Rolling Stone article that finished this great warrior's career, the freelance writer, Michael Hastings mockingly states, ""The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs."" In a war against ruthless terrorists, that sounds like the right team to me. Altar boys and freelance reporters need not apply. In combat with terrorists or any other group trying to kill you, the ""Marquis of Queensbury"" rules do not apply. Unfortunately, very few of our citizens and even fewer of our elected officials have ever served in the military. The all-volunteer military is the best fighting force in the world, though the public may not be fully aware of the crucial role it plays. Generals McChrystal and Petraeus are part of that very special military. Petraeus has put himself on the line again. Failure in Afghanistan is defined by the media, the Congress, the White House or whoever would taint his extraordinary record in Iraq. But it shouldn't, just as a few words to an overly ambitious reporter shouldn't damage the reputation, great history and service  McChrystal has given his country. We should honor and thank McChrystal. Tellingly, he never talked to the media from the time he was a captain until he was a four-star general. The New York Times article reporting his promotion was headlined, ""A general steps from the shadows."" As he retires and goes back into the shadows, every award, every recognition that he deserves should be given him. President Obama did the right thing this week by letting him retire as a four-star general. The Army and the Pentagon needs to do everything it can to recognize his service to our country. Duty, honor, country are the words each West Point cadet is to live by. Gen. McChrystal lived by them every day. On this Fourth of July weekend celebrating our independence as a nation, we need to be grateful to the men and women who over the last 234 years have served in our military to keep us free. Freedom didn't come easily and defending the American way of life has fallen on the shoulders of our fellow citizens who now voluntarily have taken on the burden of defending those liberties. They are not paid well, they are forced to serve in far-off places and spend much time away from their families. They do it because they love this country deeply and without reservation. We need to say thank you, and we need to never take their service for granted. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Ed Rollins: Senators' message to Petraeus was we love you, but not your war .

"Washington (CNN) -- A British woman on death row in Texas, convicted of murdering a young mother, had her latest appeal set aside by the Supreme Court. State corrections officials can now proceed with setting an execution date, but there is no indication when that will happen. The justices without comment on Monday refused to review her case. Linda Carty, 52, has made a public plea to British citizens, asking them and human rights groups to intervene and win her clemency. Carty, a grandmother and one-time teacher, is from the West Indies nation of St. Kitts, a former British colony. She moved to Texas when she was 23. She was convicted of taking part in the May 2001 murder of Joana Rodriguez, a 25-year-old Houston-area woman. According to the trial record, Rodriguez and her 4-day-old son were abducted by men demanding drugs and cash. Two other people inside the home were beaten and tied up. The young mother was bound with duct tape, a bag was taped over her head and she was placed in the trunk of a car. Police said Rodriguez died from suffocation, while her son survived. Prosecutors convinced a jury that Carty had hired the three men to kidnap Rodriguez, so she could steal her baby because she was no longer able to get pregnant. Evidence was presented to show Carty tried to masquerade as a new mother in order to rebuild her relationship with a boyfriend. She was sentenced to death in February 2002. She is one of 10 female prisoners on a special death row at the Mountain View prison in Gatesville, Texas. Carty asserts her innocence, and her appellate legal team claims her original trial was ""catastrophically flawed."" Among the allegations filed in various appeals are that her court-appointed lawyer was incompetent and failed to meet Carty until immediately before the trial, failed to spot flaws and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, failed to interview witnesses and did not look at key mitigating evidence. Reprieve, a British human rights groups serving as her new legal team, also said she should have been given access upon arrest to the British consulate. The British Foreign Office has filed two amicus briefs in U.S. federal courts in Carty's case, which complain that Britain was not notified of her original arrest, said a Foreign Office spokesman who declined to be named, in line with policy. The Foreign Office remains in close touch with Carty and her legal representatives, the spokesman said. ""We're continuing to provide her with consular assistance,"" he said. ""We've also made the U.S. aware of our stance (against) the death penalty."" State and federal courts have rejected her various appeals. Last year, Carty recorded a seven-minute message pleading for her life. ""Please listen and tell everyone you know,"" Carty said on the tape. ""Please don't let me die here. I'm sorry if I sound like a desperate woman. I am desperate. The British people may be my last hope."" Regarding her trial, Carty said, ""My lawyer told me he was too busy to work on my case."" Human rights activists launched a three-month project in London, England, last summer, playing her recording on a daily basis, and urging passers-by to get involved. Standing atop one of Trafalgar Square's large statue bases, or plinths, Brian Capaloff, one of those activists, held up placards with messages from Carty and stood in front of a life-size cardboard cutout of her. ""This is about someone's life and there's nothing more important than that,"" the Scottish man told CNN in September. ""It is an emotional thing."" The case is Carty v. Thaler (09-900). In other appeals before by the Supreme Court: . • The justices decided not to review whether the Boy Scouts could lease city parkland, after controversy over its policy banning atheists and homosexuals from being members or volunteers. An agnostic couple and their son, and a lesbian couple and their son challenged San Diego, California's, granting of city leases to the Scouts, which for years has run a campground and aquatic center in Balboa and Mission Bay parks. Lawsuits were filed after the city had extended a 50-year-lease. The Supreme Court let stand a federal appeals court ruling saying that the scouts are a religious organization, making the lease improper, and that the families have constitutional ""standing"" to challenge the lease. Federal law bans discrimination based on sexual orientation by religious groups, as well as government ""endorsement"" or promotion of religion. The national scouting organization denies it is religious in nature, despite a policy that youngsters should ""do duty to God."" The case is Boy Scouts of America v. Barnes-Wallace (08-1222). • Delaware was denied the chance to broaden its state-run sports betting lottery beyond its current form involving professional football. The high court without comment let stand a lower court ruling limiting betting in the state to so-called ""parlay"" or multigame bets on National Football League games. The state wanted to offer single-game bets on a variety of professional and amateur sports and events in an effort to reduce its widening budget deficit. The NFL, the NCAA and Major League Baseball sued, saying the federal government had earlier banned that kind of sports betting. Delaware had been exempt from the 1992 law because it had earlier created a multiple-game wagering lottery similar to the current system. The case is Markell v. Office of Commissioner of Baseball (09-914).","British woman asserts her innocence; her legal team calls her original trial flawed .

"(Health.com) -- Parents who believe that playing video games is less harmful to their kids' attention spans than watching TV may want to reconsider -- and unplug the Xbox. Video games can sap a child's attention just as much as the tube, a new study suggests. Elementary school children who play video games more than two hours a day are 67 percent more likely than their peers who play less to have greater-than-average attention problems, according to the study, which appears in the journal Pediatrics. Playing video games and watching TV appear to have roughly the same link to attention problems, even though video games are considered a less passive activity, the researchers say. ""Video games aren't less likely than television to be related to attention problems,"" says the lead author of the study, Edward Swing, a doctoral candidate in the department of psychology at Iowa State University, in Ames. ""They were at least as strong as television at predicting attention problems."" However, the study doesn't prove that video games directly cause attention problems. It could be that kids who have short attention spans to begin with might be more likely to pick up a joystick than a book, for instance. Health.com: Quiz: Do you have adult ADHD? The relationship between video games and attention is probably a two-way street, Swing says. ""It wouldn't surprise me if children who have attention problems are attracted to these media, and that these media increase the attention problems,"" he says. Swing and his colleagues followed more than 1,300 children in the third, fourth, and fifth grades for a little over a year. The researchers asked both the kids and their parents to estimate how many hours per week the kids spent watching TV and playing video games, and they assessed the children's attention spans by surveying their schoolteachers. Previous studies have examined the effect of TV or video games on attention problems, but not both. By looking at video-game use as well as TV watching, Swing and his colleagues were able to show for the first time that the two activities have a similar relationship to attention problems. Health.com: Attention sappers: 5 reasons you can't concentrate . C. Shawn Green, Ph.D, a postdoctoral associate in the department of psychology at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, points out that the study doesn't distinguish between the type of attention required to excel at a video game and that required to excel in school. ""A child who is capable of playing a video game for hours on end obviously does not have a global problem with paying attention,"" says Green, who has researched video games but was not involved in the current study. ""The question, then, is why are they able to pay attention to a game but not in school? What expectancies have the games set up that aren't being delivered in a school setting?"" Experts have suggested that modern TV shows are so exciting and fast paced that they make reading and schoolwork seem dull by comparison, and the same may be true for video games, the study notes. Health.com: 10 kid-targeted junk foods . It's unclear from this study whether that's the case, however, because Swing and his colleagues didn't look at the specific games the kids were playing. ""We weren't able to break [the games] down by educational versus non-educational or nonviolent versus violent,"" says Swing, adding that the impact different types of games may have on attention is a ripe area for future research. The study also suggests that young kids aren't the only ones whose attention spans may be affected by video games. Health.com: Too much TV linked to earlier death . In addition to surveying the elementary school kids, the researchers asked 210 college students about their TV and video-game use and how they felt it affected their attention. The students who logged more than two hours of TV and video games a day were about twice as likely to have attention problems, the researchers found. These attention problems later in life may be the result of ""something cumulative that builds up over a lifetime"" or ""something that happens early in life at some critical period and then stays with you,"" Swing says. ""Either way, there are implications that would lead us to want to reduce television and video games in childhood."" The American Academy of Pediatrics, the leading professional organization for pediatricians and the publisher of Pediatrics, recommends that parents limit all ""screen time"" (including video and computer games) to less than two hours per day. Health.com: The 10 habits of healthy families . For his part, Green says that how much time kids spend playing video games should be a matter of common sense and parental judgment. ""A hard boundary, such as two hours, is completely arbitrary,"" he says. ""Children are individuals, and what makes sense for one won't necessarily work for another.""

"(CNN) -- Strikes fueled by higher prices for gasoline, diesel and kerosene spread across sections of India on Monday, disrupting rail and port traffic in some areas. Officials reported trains were largely empty in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai, where protests by Hindu nationalist opposition activists often bring the city to a halt. Indian railway spokesman Anil Saxena said the eastern parts of the country were the hardest hit. ""Obstructions (by strikers) are more pronounced on the eastern side,"" Saxena said. He was referring to communist-ruled West Bengal state and neighboring Orissa and Bihar. Truckers also joined the strike, parking their rigs and shutting down traffic that would normally carry goods in and out of the busy port. Opposition parties called for the strikes after the government began implementing a roll back in fuel subsides by lifting state controls on gasoline and other fuels. Demonstrations over fuel-price rises also took place in parts of New Delhi. Opposition protesters deflated tires of state-run buses in some neighborhoods. Private schools were closed Monday in the Indian capital. Television footage showed police using bamboo canes to break up a violent protest in the northern Indian city of Lucknow. Activists were also shown blocking a train in Patna in eastern India. For the average Indian, the changes are having a real impact. Usri Das Mahapatra's kitchen budget has soared the past year. Now, she fears the worst is yet to come. The 46-year-old homemaker in Mumbai is bracing for a spike in her household expenses. An increase in fuel costs will create a ripple effect on the prices of food transported to her city from across India. Her son, an undergraduate student, too is likely to be paying more for his commute. Traveling costs in the family car or spent eating out are already higher, she says. Mahapatra, whose husband is an executive in a shipping company, is worried. ""High inflation is hitting our savings. In a year, my kitchen expenses have almost doubled. This (fuel price) hike is unjustified,"" she said. But planners say India's subsidies are too much for a nation that is facing a consolidated fiscal deficit of 8.4 percent. As world leaders pledged fiscal tight-belting at the G-20 summit in Toronto, India said it has its plans in place to halve its deficit in three to four years. Ahead of the meeting, India removed subsidies that artificially kept cost of petrol lower than its market value -- as a result, the prices of gasoline and cooking fuel, like kerosene and kitchen gas, shot up. ""We have independently (prepared), even prior to the G-20 coming to this understanding (on consolidation), a roadmap which is designed to cut our fiscal deficit, Indian fiscal deficit, to half by 2013-14,"" said Ashok Chawla, the country's finance secretary. On his way back from Canada, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh identified what he called ""excessive populism"" as a key area to deal with in India's financial management. Broadly, the South Asian nation spends heavily on subsidizing fertilizers, food and fuel. India has also launched a range of state-funded programs to help millions of its people still living in crippling poverty despite the country's rise as an economic powerhouse. But officials are aware benefits reach target beneficiaries in a trickle because of rampant corruption and weak enforcement. ""A bottleneck and an impediment in bringing about the desired results, for which policies and schemes have been formulated and huge allocation of funds made, is weak implementation and corruption in the system,"" noted Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil in her national address on her country's 61st Republic Day this year. India's subsidy bill is about 10 percent of its overall annual spending and about 1.72 percent of its GDP, said M. Govinda Rao, member of Singh's economic advisory council. ""When you can't expect revenues to rise very fast, it becomes important to reduce expenditure,"" said Rao, citing the country's targets for fiscal consolidation. ""Our subsidy system is badly flawed."" Nonetheless, Singh's government, now in the second year of its second term in office, remains firm. ""(O)ur people are wise enough to understand that excessive populism should not be allowed to derail the progress our country is making, and for which it is winning kudos internationally as well,"" the prime minister told reporters last week as criticism at home mounted over cutting fuel subsidies. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Strikes fueled by higher prices for gasoline, diesel and kerosene .

"(CNN) -- For two years in a row, I celebrated Independence Day in the oppressive heat of Iraq along with fellow soldiers. A few nonalcoholic beers and some locally grown watermelon were our replacement for hot dogs and potato salad. This year, as Americans across the nation celebrate July Fourth with barbecues and fireworks, those most responsible for defending our independence, the military, will continue to fight two wars. And it is a shame that we will let yet another July Fourth pass us by without making substantial progress toward ending our unnecessary dependence on oil, a dependence that is funding the bullets that our enemies fire at our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is for that reason, and many more, that the fight for energy independence is being fought here at home, a struggle I hope more Americans will join in support of those who are fighting abroad. Oil poses a clear threat to America's economic and national security. This spring we have watched as untold millions of gallons of oil flowed into the Gulf. But for years, we have watched as billions of dollars flowed to hostile nations to pay for oil. Every day, we send well over a billion dollars out of this country to pay for oil -- money that could and should be used to grow our economy and create jobs. The simple fact is that our dependence on oil from nations in the Middle East and other regions constrains our choices, hamstringing America's flexibility and choices on the world stage. Too often, we are forced to consider the impact our foreign policy will have on our oil supply instead of whether a choice is in line with our values. Every day, we make a clear choice between living up to those values (and strengthening our security) and prolonging our weakness as a dirty-energy nation. Today, thousands of Americans are calling for a new freedom from oil -- a dangerous, dirty and vulnerable source of energy. This week, 10,000 American flags were planted on the National Mall, each representing Americans who have pledged to free our nation from a long and damaging cycle of dependence. As Americans look to rebuild our economy, we must consider the massive, alarming and unprecedented transfer of wealth to those who do not share our values. America's ability to underwrite our national security always had, at its heart, the pumping arteries of a vibrant economy. Unless we act soon, we will be held hostage to the rest of the world, not just for oil, but for the clean-energy technology that will power the next century of growth and prosperity. Already dependent on oil, our country needs to act now lest we become dependent on China for solar panels. A more insidious impact of our dependence is clear in America's foreign and military policy. Today we are forced to both pay and protect the nations that supply our oil, the very nations that fuel extremism around the world and turn a blind eye to terrorist funding within their own borders. That money, winding its way through shady front groups and so-called charities, ends up funding not just insurgents in Iraq, but also in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrates, in clear and often painful terms, just how unreliable our energy sources have become. We are forced to drill to the deepest depths of the ocean, to despoil the richness of our God-given natural treasures, and to rely on dangerously uncontrollable technologies. It is time for us to stand on our own -- to take control of our energy -- with sources that will not threaten our security, fund our enemies or force us to ignore our values. The long struggle to live up to the challenge of our values has always been difficult, but today we stand at a clear crossroads between moving beyond oil or prolonging our dependence on it. Clean, American power is possible, but only if we commit ourselves to achieving that goal. In the spirit of the holiday and in light of the tragedy in the Gulf, let us dedicate the next two decades to winning a new battle for American independence -- from oil.

"(CNN) -- The discussion of race is never a black and white issue, and recent ""AC360°"" and CNN.com reports about young children's attitudes on race became one of the most discussed stories on the site, eliciting more than 4,500 comments. In the study, white children had an overwhelming bias toward white, and black children also had a bias toward white, but it was not nearly as strong as the bias shown by the white children. Many users of the site thought parenting was the issue behind the results, some thought the kids were too naive and others thought the testing method was flawed. Kids' test answers on race brings mother to tears . Margaret Beale Spencer, a leading researcher in the field of child development, designed the pilot study for CNN's ""AC360."" Beale Spencer used a team of three psychologists to implement it: two testers to execute the study and a statistician to help analyze the results. Her team tested 133 children from schools that met very specific economic and demographic requirements. In total, eight schools participated: four in the greater New York area and four in Georgia. Spencer's test aimed to re-create the landmark doll test from the 1940s. Those tests, conducted by psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark, were designed to measure how segregation affected African-American children. Full doll study results . Many people who read the story commented that racism is a learned behavior. ""I do believe that parents must take an active role [regardless of race] to inform their children that they are no better or no worse than anyone because of race,"" Kejohn03 wrote. ""These lessons were taught to me and when I have children I will do the same. Once this happens, then there will be less misconceptions and negative perceptions regarding race."" Another reader thought many people missed the point of the results of the study. No one says the children are racist, Trumpet01 wrote. ""The problem here is that if parents do not talk to their kid about race and how to perceive people that are 'different from them', they would simply form their opinions based on whatever [right or wrong] they gather from society. To suggest that anyone is labeling these innocent kids to be racist is merely unfortunate,"" the writer said. Watch the psychologist who devised the test talk about the role of parents .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, considered Hezbollah's first spiritual leader, has died, his office told CNN Sunday. According to Hezbollah's website, Fadlallah will be buried Tuesday after the noon prayer at Beirut's al-Imamain al-Hassanein mosque in the capital's Shiite-dominated southern neighborhood. Two days ago, a source in his office told CNN that Fadlallah had been hospitalized in Lebanon and was in ""critical condition."" The hospitalization came after widespread rumors that the Shiite leader may not live much longer. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri called Fadlallah a ""great national and spiritual scholar."" ""He was at all times and circumstances the voice of moderation, calling for the unity of Lebanese in particular and the Muslims in general, rejecting -- and issuing religious edicts against -- strife, and calling for dialogue as a mean to resolve differences,"" Hariri said. ""He taught us to be a people of dialogue and to reject injustice and resist occupation,"" Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said in a statement Sunday. Fadlallah was born in 1935 in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraq, and completed his Quranic studies there, according to his website. He has lived in Lebanon since the 1960s and became a spiritual leader of Hezbollah after it was founded in 1982 in response to an Israeli invasion. In recent years, however, Fadlallah had become distanced from Hezbollah's Iran-influenced leadership. ""He stood with great courage and clarity supporting the resistance against the Zionist enemy and was a prominent advocate of Islamic unity fighting division and strife,"" Hezbollah said in a statement. His views on various topics, including the role of women, are laid out on his website and are considered liberal for a Shiite cleric. But he never swayed from his criticism of Israel. In a letter penned to President Barack Obama last year, Fadlallah said: ""The size of support and cover-up provided by your country for the Zionist entity has become known. This entity was established on the land whose people were uprooted by the power of iron and fire. The subsequent American policies have contributed to the loss of the Palestinian cause, despite the ratification of many Security Council resolutions."" The United States considers Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran and Syria, a terrorist organization. The Shiite group is a major provider of social services in Lebanon but also operates a militant wing. CNN's Nada Husseini contributed to this report.","Ayatollah Fadlallah to be buried Tuesday .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- When it comes to employee/boss relationships, John Ewert -- vice president at DRIVEN Public Relations in Temecula, California -- believes he has a fantastic one. ""For starters, I think the most important thing that makes the relationship between me and my boss so great is respect,"" Ewert says. ""We are accountable for our actions, good or bad, and own up to our mistakes while offering credit where credit is due. We take great pride in agreeing to disagree, but not without discussing subjects in an open manner and exploring options to find solutions. I know it sounds cheesy, but respect and trust are the keys to any successful relationship."" As experts, supervisors and satisfied workers will attest, Ewert's ""cheesy"" advice is spot on. Here are some tips on how anybody can forge a better relationship with his or her boss. Communication counts . ""In many office environments, employees and management are so involved in daily job requirements that communication may be pushed aside. In the long term, lack of communication can damage an employee/supervisor relationship,"" states Marni Bobich, team manager from Administaff (a professional employer organization). Daily e-mail exchanges are fast and oftentimes sufficient, yet Bobich suggests periodically requesting face-time. ""While you don't want to become a nuisance, in-person communication can go a long way in displaying your desire to develop and maintain a positive working relationship. Determine the type of information that is best communicated face-to-face and discuss it during your meeting."" Building trust . Experts agree that one instance where you should always go to your boss is when there is a potential problem. ""If a project isn't going well, don't hide bad news from her for fear of looking bad,"" says Melinda Stephenson, cofounder of The Leadership Room, a unique development program for rising executives. ""Let her know if a problem is brewing or if you're struggling with something. If your boss can trust you to give her a 'heads up' and to bring solutions to problems, you've built a solid relationship."" ""And save your boss time!"" says Anja Schuetz, a people management coach from The Netherlands. ""When going to him with a problem, tell him all the things you have already tried to solve it. Anticipate his questions, and bring documents and proof along so your boss can see things through your eyes and is able to rule things out quickly, rather than thinking the whole thing through from scratch."" Other ways to develop trust include: . • Keeping confidential any sensitive information about your boss or the company. • Refraining from talking about your boss behind his back. • Pointing out his mistakes tactfully (and preferably in private). Bosses are people too . It pays to remember that bosses like a pleasant atmosphere as much as any employee. While you needn't set out to make him your new best friend, developing a cordial relationship can strengthen ties. ""We always begin each conversation, whether it be by phone or e-mail, with a friendly greeting, such as 'Good Morning!' or 'How was your weekend?'"" says Kaitlynn Carter, who works for a wedding-planning company in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  ""It goes a long way when you show that you are considering the other person and that you are committed to having a friendly exchange!"" Other ideas for building a personable, yet office-appropriate, relationship include: . • Giving a genuine compliment. (I like your new coat.) • Talking about a common interest. (Did you see the baseball game last night?) • Expressing interest in a major life event. (How did your son's graduation go?) • Showing gratitude. (Thanks for letting me leave early to attend my daughter's recital.) • Offering kudos. (Congratulations on landing that new account.) An occasional lunch together also can help. If the two of you travel for business, use the time waiting for the plane or riding in a taxi to get to know one another as individuals. Remember you're on the same side . Chances are that you and your boss want many of the same things: a paycheck, recognition, a strong company, career fulfillment. Looking at situations as cohorts can help both parties. ""The bottom line: positive effort equals positive results,"" Ewert says. ""Sometimes there are projects that we don't want to do, sometimes we have issues outside of work that are out of our control, sometimes our clients move up deadlines or change the focus for a project, but instead of harping on an issue and running away, we adapt and overcome. We view our clients and employees as partners, and we have a lot of fun helping businesses and employees be successful."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010. All rights reserved.

"New York (CNN)  -- You'd think that Tori Spelling showing up three hours late to her own book release party was the ultimate snub. But don't judge this tell-all by its cover. Spelling had spent the last four hours signing autographs at a local Borders store, and insisted on talking with every person in line and posing for snapshots. An entrepreneur, Spelling wears many (presumably stylish) hats. She and her husband, actor Dean McDermott -- along with the couple's children Liam, 3, and Stella, 2 -- star in their own reality TV show, ""Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood."" Spelling also has her own jewelry line, designs children's clothing, and is a working actress, spokeswoman and author. ""The great thing about what I do is I only take on work and businesses that are organic to me and I'm passionate about. It's kind of a blend of my life because at some point, my life became my business, and my business is my life ... which is a hard balance to strike,"" Spelling said. In her latest book, ""uncharted terriTORI,"" Spelling tackles eating disorder rumors (she says she had H1N1), the truth about her marriage, her friendships (or lack thereof) with her former ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" co-stars, motherhood and the thawing of her icy relationship with her own mother. Spelling was eager to set the record straight about all talk of anorexia. ""I address all of my health issues in the book,"" she told CNN. ""And I think it's really irresponsible to label someone with an eating disorder. I pride myself on being an inspiration to women out there, and I want them to have a healthy body image. I have a daughter of my own, so I think they should really do research and get their facts straight."" Regarding her marriage, Spelling says, ""Dean and I haven't hid the fact that we've had a rough year."" She attributes what she refers to as the couple's ""four-year crossroads"" to a communications breakdown, differing opinions on parenting and McDermott's opposition to her own self-proclaimed ""workaholic tendencies."" In her book, Spelling said she had come to terms with the fact that, like all couples, she and McDermott were in an ""ebb"" phase, and that things weren't always going to ""flow."" She wrote: ""If someone says they're in a perfect relationship -- they're lying. And I was the girl who went into it wanting the perfect relationship."" Although the internet is rampant with stories about Spelling receiving the silent treatment from the old ""90210"" gang, she was asked about the possibility of her character, Donna Martin, returning to the small screen on the new ""90210."" ""You know what,"" Spelling told CNN. ""I totally would, but they haven't called me. For the fans, I would."" Spelling, famous among her friends for throwing elaborate parties, is currently shooting a new reality show with the Oxygen network. ""We're currently filming 'Tori & Dean: Weddings,' "" she says, ""which is really amazing because everyone knows I love planning a party, and I specifically love planning a wedding and I'm all about love. Dean and I have been working on our relationship this year and kind of getting back to us. And really, what's better than love and a party? So there you have the perfect wedding. And we have this great, unbelievable opportunity to plan people's dream weddings and kind of navigate young couples through the process of getting married -- what their relationship is now and what they can look forward to and guide them through that."" When asked about the return of ""Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood,"" which just wrapped up its fourth season, Spelling told CNN, ""No official pickup has been announced, but if the fans bring us back, I think there's a very good chance. The fans are worried that this is a replacement, but we plan on doing both shows, so the great thing about that is they'll get two sets of 'Tori & Dean' two times a year instead of one set one time a year."" Spelling's next writing project is a children's book, due in September. ""I am really excited about that,"" she told CNN. ""I love writing, it's a passion of mine and I love my kids, and I really wanted to do a children's book. I'm working with my same publishers, Simon and Schuster, and when they told me they wanted to do a children's book, and I was like, 'Yes! I am so in!' So I dedicated this book to Liam and Stella -- it's called 'Presenting ... Tallulah,' and it's about a little girl standing up for who she is and believing in herself."" Spelling also shared an anecdote about Stella: ""Her new thing is she sings 'Single Ladies' and she dances to it. No joke, she shakes her hips!"" Spelling says the little girl didn't learn it from her. ""She watched 'Chipmunks: The Squeakquel'. They do it in that!""","Tori Spelling and her family star in reality TV show, ""Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood""

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Initial results from test runs of a ship billed as the world's largest oil skimming vessel could come back Monday after a weekend spent plowing the seas atop the undersea gusher in the Gulf of Mexico. The converted cargo ship A Whale spent the weekend attempting to separate crude oil from seawater in a 25-square-mile area north of the ruptured BP oil well at the heart of the disaster. If the test is successful, the massive vessel could play a key role in efforts to clean up the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Initial results from tests are expected Monday, Bob Grantham, spokesman for the company that owns the ship, said. The ship, which swallows water with oil then separates it, can skim about 21 million gallons of oil a day. That's at least 250 times the amount that modified fishing vessels currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain, according to Taiwanese company TMT shipping, which owns the vessel. A total of about 550 skimming vessels were out in the Gulf on Sunday, according to a spokeswoman for the Unified Command Joint Information Center in Houma, Louisiana. But with oil still pouring into the sea at a rate of tens of thousands of barrels a day, federal authorities closed a new section of the Gulf off Louisiana to fishing on Sunday. The latest order from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration adds nearly 1,100 square miles of federal waters off Louisiana's Vermilion Bay to the off-limits zone. The new closure brings the portion of the Gulf closed to fishing due to the massive BP spill off Louisiana to 33.2 percent, NOAA reported. The Coast Guard reported earlier Sunday that a shift in weather patterns could send more oil toward sensitive shores in Mississippi and Louisiana, and bad weather over the past few days has significantly hampered cleanup efforts. ""The weather is one challenge you can't defeat,"" Coast Guard Adm. Paul Zunkunft said. Ribbons of oil stripe the water for miles, but waves Saturday were still too high for boats to skim oil off the water. ""At the Coast Guard, we do take it personally. It is portrayed as mission failure any time oil washes ashore,"" he said. Zunkunft said he will put the skimmers back to work as soon as the sea calms. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels (1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf daily since April 20, when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana. The A Whale arrived in the Gulf on Wednesday and has been awaiting approval to join in cleanup efforts. The skimmer works by ""taking in oily water through a series of vents, or jaws, on the side of the ship and then decanting the intake,"" Grantham said. ""In many ways, the ship collects water like an actual whale and pumps internally like a human heart."" Zunkunft said he is also calling in reinforcements, including 300 new skimmers in the next two weeks. For the 12-hour period from midnight until noon Saturday, approximately 7,980 barrels (335,160 gallons) of oil were collected and about 4,155 barrels (174,510 gallons) of oil and 28.3 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared, BP said. The company said about 25,290 barrels (1,062,180 gallons) of oil were recovered Friday. CNN's Allan Chernoff contributed to this report.","NEW: Fisheries closure extended down Louisiana coast .

"(CNN) -- David Villa joined Lionel Messi at the top of the Spanish goalscoring charts, hitting his 13th and 14th goals of the season as Valencia moved three points behind second-placed Real Madrid after a 4-1 derby win over 10-man Villarreal. Argentine Ever Banega opened the scoring in the sixth minute and Villa converted a 28th-minute penalty which he had won. Villarreal's center-back Francisco Kiko was sent off for conceding the spot-kick, giving Valencia a man extra for over an hour. David Silva, finding his best form after recovering from injury, made it 3-0 in the 56th minute before Villarreal's Brazilian Nilmar pulled one back five minutes later. However, Spanish international Villa grabbed his second in stoppage time to join Barcelona's Messi on 14 goals. It was a welcome tonic for Valencia following their Spanish Kings Cup defeat to Deportivo La Coruna on Wednesday and they are now just three adrift of Real who lost 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. In other matches, Atletico Madrid made it a perfect three league wins in 2010 with a 3-2 home win victory over Sporting Gijon at the Vicente Calderon as they continued their push towards the European places. Atletico had scored nine goals in their last two matches and the goals continued to flow with Diego Forlan, Paulo Assuncao and teenager Ibrahima Balde on target as a resurgent Atletico moved seven points off sixth-placed Sevilla. Earlier on Sunday, Real Mallorca moved up to fourth place, recording a ninth successive home win with a 2-0 victory over rivals Deportivo La Coruna. Julio Alvarez gave an early warning, hitting the post for Mallorca on 12 minutes and the goal duly arrived a minute after the interval through Mario Suarez, with Chori Castro adding a second eight minutes later. It capped a fine week for Mallorca who reached the quarterfinals of the Spanish Cup in midweek with a win over Rayo Vallecano and now sit in the Champions League places after leapfrogging Deportivo, now two points behind in fifth, as they maintained their flawless home record.","David Villa goes joint top of the Spanish scoring charts with two goals against Villarreal .

"(CNN) -- Could another deep water- or even shallow water- oil drilling disaster be looming ahead? Experts warn it certainly could happen again. The Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, they say, highlights flaws in the drilling industry's main defense against oil and gas explosions -- the blowout preventer, which is supposed to shut down an oil and gas well if something goes wrong. Oil companies have treated such devices as virtually fail-safe. ""They're certainly not fail-safe because they didn't close this well,"" said Paul Bommer, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""If they had been 100 percent fail-safe they would have sealed, they would have closed.,"" There have been numerous rig blowouts, including a large gusher in the Timor Sea off the coast of Western Australia last year. And a growing number of blowouts in the past decade have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier. Seventy-two spills dumped 18,000 barrels of oil into U.S. federal waters from 2000-2009, while only 15 spills put 2,000 barrels into the water during the prior decade, according to data compiled by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Interior Department, which regulates energy exploration (The database excludes spills of less than 50 barrels). Avoiding such spills depends upon the reliability of the blowout preventer, which is essentially a faucet on top of the oil well that keeps oil and gas from gushing to the surface. Rig workers use the preventer to keep a well under control, especially when oil and gas surge, or ""kick up,"" from a well. When its valves don't do the job, the blowout preventer can choke off the drilling pipe -- like squeezing a straw while drinking. And, If that fails to work, a blowout preventer has yet another line of defense -- huge shear rams, like giant scissors that are supposed to be able to cut and seal the drilling pipe. But, a mile underwater, where the pressure is intense, drill pipes need to be thick, especially the joints between them. And those joints are very hard to cut. ""There are some parts of the pipe that the shears were never meant to cut,"" said Ford Brett, an expert in petroleum project management who is advising the Interior Department's oil drilling safety review. ""No one's equipment will shear the drill collar body. That's a lot of metal. It's not going to be possible to shear certain things,"" added Benton Baugh, another advisor to Interior's review of the Deepwater incident and president of Radoil, which designs and manufactures oilfield and subsea drilling equipment. A 2002 study for the Minerals Management Service warned of such trouble in shearing drilling pipe deep underwater. Initial research painted ""a grim picture of the probability of success when utilizing this final tool in securing a well,"" wrote consultant West Engineering Services. West Engineering would not comment to CNN on its studies for the government. ""The blowout preventers had a probability of failing to crush that pipe that approaches 50 percent,"" said Robert Bea, engineering professor and expert in ocean engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, who is familiar with the study. ""It would be like getting on an airplane having a 50 percent chance of making it to your destination."" Based on 55 years of engineering experience, including a stint as chief offshore engineer for Shell, Bea warned government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea, and he worries they could fail in the Arctic, where the industry is pursuing energy resources. ""You can keep on pushing equipment to the point of where it breaks, and I think we broke it,"" he said. ""All of the drilling operations underway of this nature in the world today depend on these devices as the final line of defense."" In the harshest of environments, a mile underwater or in the Arctic tundra, blowout preventers operate under great stress, increasing their potential vulnerability to wear and tear. ""It is a mechanical piece of equipment. It is utilized in harsh environments. Yes, it can wear out,"" said Steve Sears, chairman of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Louisiana State University. In fact, BP told congressional investigators there were several leaks in the hydraulic system that was supposed to power the shear rams of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer. ""It was a coupling that had not been tightened down adequately. It was several turns loose,"" said a person with knowledge of the investigation. BP officials also discovered a dead battery. The final safety switch for a blowout preventer that has lost communication with its oil rig is the ""deadman"" system that's supposed to trigger the blowout preventer to shut the well. It did not activate during BP's April 20 rig explosion. Another study West Engineering Services prepared for the Minerals Management System in 2003 found flaws with the deadman system. ""The most serious drawback to this system ... is the mind set of the rig personnel. Many operator and contractor personnel refuse to arm the system from fear that it will either not operate when needed or activate inappropriately, causing downtime,"" the report said. Such downtime can be extremely costly. If the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $10 million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production, said Baugh. Given the multiple problems with blowout preventers, energy experts concede the oil industry must quickly raise its safety bar. ""We must improve the safety systems of blowout preventers. Obviously it's time to take it to the next level,"" said Baugh. ""There are more strenuous conditions occurring and we must have more strenuous solutions for them."" The Interior Department, facing the reality of energy drilling dangers, is working to toughen rules for offshore oil exploration. ""We must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law,"" said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Drilling operations not subject to the administration's six-month deepwater drilling moratorium have until the end of the month to: . -- Provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers, . -- Install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers (current regulations do not require such a backup), and . -- Adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers. By September the Interior Department intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of shear rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency. The Interior Department says such steps will ""increase the safety in offshore oil and gas development,"" but concedes they ""represent only the beginning of the department's work.""","Rig blowouts have been on the increase in recent decades .

"(CNN) -- The July 2011 deadline to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan is unrealistic and unhelpful, Afghan Ambassador Said Tayeb Jawad told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""First, if you over-emphasize a deadline that is not realistic, you are making the enemy a lot more bold,"" Jawad said. ""You are prolonging the war. That deadline should be realistic. The line should be based on the reality on the ground and we should give a clear message to the enemy, to the terrorists who are a threat to everyone, that the United States, NATO, Afghans are there to finish this job."" He continued, ""If that's not the feeling, we lost the support of the Afghan people, and also make the neighboring countries of interest a lot more bolder to interfere in Afghanistan."" President Barack Obama and Gen. David Petraeus, who has replaced Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, have said they would begin withdrawal in July 2011 depending on conditions on the ground. Appearing on ABC's ""This Week,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, questioned the wisdom of a firm deadline to start withdrawing forces. ""I'm all for dates for withdrawal, but that's after the strategy succeeds, not before,"" said McCain, the Republican presidential candidate in 2008 who was in Afghanistan for the Fourth of July weekend. For now, McCain described the strategy as one that hasn't gone as well as hoped. ""The president should state unequivocally that we will leave when we have succeeded,"" he said. ""If you tell the enemy that you're leaving on a date certain, unequivocally, then that enemy will wait until you leave."" McCain's GOP colleague, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, echoed those thoughts in a separate interview from Afghanistan broadcast on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""If you send a signal to your enemy you're going to leave at a certain date, they'll wait you out,"" Graham said. However, he expressed optimism that the counterinsurgency strategy now being led by Petraeus can show progress in turning over security to Afghan forces in some areas by July 2011. ""I do believe next summer we can have transition in certain parts of Afghanistan,"" Graham said. ""Other parts will still need fighting and a firm commitment."" Overall, Graham said, he found morale on the ground ""pretty good"" as Petraeus assumed command of the mission. His trip coincides with the visit to Afghanistan by Vice President Joe Biden, and Graham said Biden had assured him that any withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country would be ""conditions-based"" instead of launched purely for the sake of getting out without consideration for the status of the mission. Graham joined McCain in urging Obama to clarify the conditions-based approach so that the nation's allies and enemies understand the U.S. commitment to the war. Last week, some Democrats in Congress supported an amendment to a military spending bill that would have required Obama to give Congress a new intelligence report on Afghanistan by January and a plan for withdrawing troops by April. If Obama fails to carry out his pledge to start bringing troops home by July 2011, Congress would need to approve additional funding for the war, the amendment said. The measure failed in a late-night vote after the White House threatened to veto the bill if it contained the amendment, but the language showed some restlessness among Democrats about the war strategy.","NEW: Sen.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Friday announced new government investments in 66 projects to expand broadband connections in rural and poor areas across the country. The $795 million in grants and loans funded by the 2009 economic stimulus act will create 5,000 construction and installation jobs, and generate $200 million in associated private investment, according to information provided by the White House. ""We're moving forward"" in the creation of a twenty-first century economy, Obama said. ""Studies have shown"" that such an investment can eventually ""lead to hundreds of thousands of new jobs."" It will also accelerate the country's switch to a ""smarter, stronger, more secure electrical grid."" Over 685,000 businesses, 900 health care facilities and 2,400 schools in all 50 states will benefit from the investment, according to a White House document. The money will bring broadband services to communities that ""currently have little or no access, to help them better compete and do business in the global marketplace,"" the document said. ""With new or increased broadband access, communities can compete on a level playing field to attract new businesses, schools can create distance learning opportunities, medical professionals can provide cost-efficient remote diagnoses and care, and business owners can expand the market for their products beyond their neighborhoods to better compete in the global economy,"" the document noted. In addition, the federal money also will fund public computing centers in libraries, community colleges and other public venues, according to the document.","NEW: Obama announces investments in 66 broadband projects .

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- A Romanian military plane crash near the Tuzla Romania Airport by the Black Sea has killed 11 people, including air force Col. Nicolae Jianu, and injured three more, the Ministry of Defense said Monday. Shortly after takeoff around 5:40 p.m. local time, the Antonov 2 plane with five air force crew members and nine navy paratroopers on board suddenly lost altitude and hit the ground, bursting into flames. The plane belonged to the Romanian air force application school Aurel Vlaicu in Boboc. Jianu was the commanding officer there and a flight instructor, the Defense Ministry said.

"(CNN) -- Noted author and social activist Howard Zinn died of a heart attack Wednesday while traveling, his daughter, Myla Kabat-Zinn, said. Zinn, author of ""A People's History of the United States,"" was 87. Kabat-Zinn said her father, who lived in Auburndale, Massachusetts,"" died while traveling in Santa Monica, California. ""A People's History of the United States,"" first published in 1980, tells a history not often in seen in other books -- from the perspective of those not in a seat of power. The book was the inspiration for a 2009 documentary, narrated by Zinn, called ""The People Speak."" The film highlighted people who spoke up for social change, according to the Web site of the History Channel, which aired the program. Zinn was a shipyard worker and Air Force bombardier before he went to college under the GI Bill and received a Ph.D. from Columbia University, according to his Web site. He taught at numerous universities, including Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, and Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. Kabat-Zinn said of her father that he lived a ""very full and exciting life"" and that there were many social issues that were very important to him. Above all, she said, her father believed that there is no ""just war."" Zinn's death on the day of President Obama's first State of the Union address was underscored by his contribution to a recently released special from The Nation magazine called ""Obama at One."" ""I've been searching hard for a highlight,"" he wrote. ""The only thing that comes close is some of Obama's rhetoric; I don't see any kind of a highlight in his actions and policies."" Zinn said he was not ""terribly disappointed because I didn't expect that much,"" noting that he has been ""a traditional Democratic president"" on foreign policy -- ""hardly any different from a Republican"" -- and has been cautious in domestic policy. ""On health care, for example, he starts out with a compromise, and when you start out with a compromise, you end with a compromise of a compromise, which is where we are now,"" Zinn said. Zinn also cautioned ""that Obama is going to be a mediocre president -- which means, in our time, a dangerous president -- unless there is some national movement to push him in a better direction.""","Noted author and social activist Howard Zinn died while traveling in California, daughter says .

"(CNN) -- Texas Rangers President Nolan Ryan is calling a Tuesday night incident in which a baseball fan fell about 30 feet from the second deck of Rangers Ballpark trying to catch a foul ball an unfortunate accident. ""It's pretty hard to guard against something of that nature,"" Ryan said at a Wednesday news conference. Some guard railings in the stadium had been raised after a 1994 incident in which a woman suffered multiple injuries after falling 35 feet from the upper deck while posing for a picture, according to a report published in the Star-Telegram on April 15, 1994. Ryan said safety policies in the stadium were reviewed after Tuesday's incident and that the second-deck railings measure more than 30 inches high, above the standardized code of 26 inches. Ryan said the man who fell Tuesday night, Tyler Morris, was in good spirits when Ryan visited with him Wednesday at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. Ryan said Morris, a firefighter with the Lake Cities Fire Department in Corinth, Texas, has fractures to the skull, foot and ankle, but hasn't lost his enthusiasm for the team. ""I was expecting him to look a lot worse then he did. I think being a firefighter, and being in the shape he is, worked in his favor,"" Ryan said. He said Morris has some recollection of what happened. ""He thought he was going to catch the ball,"" said Ryan. ""He said it hit the tip of his finger. The next thing he knew he was falling."" Ryan said Morris remembered hitting the electronic message board at the stadium, but nothing after that. Ryan said he doesn't believe Morris jumped to get the ball, but said he probably extended himself, or reached for it, before falling over the second-deck railing. Ryan also said he and other members of the Rangers organization brought Morris several autographed items when they visited him at the hospital, including the ball that he was trying to catch when he fell. ""He was as thrilled to get that as anything else we brought him,"" Ryan said. ""He's a die-hard Rangers fan, and grew up a Rangers fan. He was real appreciative that we came to visit him,"" Ryan said. Wednesday morning, the Morris family issued a statement that said Morris is expected to make a full recovery, according to CNN affiliate KTVT/KTXA, . Morris is lucky to be alive, according to an off-duty paramedic who was one of the first people to come to the man's aid. ""The fall could have easily killed the guy,"" Derek Dilday said. In an interview with HLN, Dilday said he rushed to the man's aid after witnessing the entire incident. ""I turned to my left to watch the foul ball, and I saw this guy reach over the railing. Then I saw his feet go up, he tried to reach back for the railing, but he missed it. He hit the video-tron (electronic message board), then fell the rest of the way like a rag doll."" ""It was the most shocking thing I had even seen,"" he said. Dilday said he ran about 50 feet to get to the spot where Morris had fallen. ""He was laying in the aisle on his back. There was no external bleeding, which was a good thing. I held his head and tried to keep him still until the medics arrived."" Dilday said Morris was having difficulty breathing but was trying to move. ""He tried to move his neck, he tried to get up, I kept telling him, 'Stay still, stay still.'"" By the time medics arrived, Morris was able to say his name, Dilday said. ""He was able to move all his extremities and was responsive to the paramedics,"" Rangers spokesman John Blake said. Morris fell on top of four other fans, causing minor injuries to them, said Ryan. ""One woman had a bruised knee, one man had a bruised shoulder, someone was hit by Morris's shoe,"" he said. ""They chose not to go to the hospital emergency room and were treated in the stadium's first aid area,"" Ryan said. All stayed for the remainder of the game, he said. The game between the Texas Rangers and Cleveland Indians was delayed for 16 minutes after the fall. The Rangers eventually won, 12-1.

"BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN)  -- Hollywood glitz may pay Dana Delany's bills, but her ""most life-affirming role"" was a lot less glamorous. Luke Evnin heads the Scleroderma Research Foundation, and actress Dana Delany is a board member. In 1996, the Emmy Award winner and ""Desperate Housewives"" actress played a patient dying of scleroderma in the ABC TV movie, ""For Hope."" The film was based on the true story of actor/comedian Bob Saget's sister, Gay, who died of the chronic, degenerative disease. ""When you're playing someone who's dying, all you want is life,"" Delany recalled. ""It really educated a lot of people about the disease, including me."" The role led Delany to join the movement to find a cure for the illness. Today, with scleroderma patient Luke Evnin helping to lead the efforts, Delany said that people are increasingly aware of the disease and working toward a cure. Symptoms for scleroderma, Greek for ""hard skin,"" can include skin thickening or tightness. It has no known cause and in most serious cases, it can be life-threatening. Scleroderma can cause abnormal growth of connective tissue and potentially harm blood vessels and internal organs. More than 300,000 people suffer from scleroderma-related diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health. The disease disproportionately affects women of child-bearing age, but anyone can contract it, including children. ""So many people are disfigured,"" Delany said. ""They don't want to go out in public and they don't want to talk about it."" In 1999, Delany joined the board of the Scleroderma Research Foundation, a nonprofit corporation in San Francisco, California. When its founder, Delany's friend Sharon Monsky, died from the disease in 2002, Delany was introduced to Evnin, the new foundation chairman. The two became instant friends. Evnin -- a successful venture capitalist with a doctorate in microbiology -- was a ""perfect storm"" for the foundation and for scleroderma research, Delany said. ""It was almost a miracle, really,"" she said. ""Here was this handsome family man who didn't look sick at all, but his experience made him the perfect person to be running the board, on many levels. He understands the science. He understands the money that needs to be involved [and] how to invest it. He understands how to talk to the researchers."" Diagnosed with scleroderma in 1998, Evnin, 45, considers himself lucky. ""I have a lot of hidden symptoms, but [they] are stable and I won't die from scleroderma. I'm on the fortunate end of the spectrum,"" said Evnin. ""Scleroderma is being misdiagnosed all across the country and a misdiagnosis can be fatal."" Evnin works full-time as general partner for a multi-billion dollar biotechnical and life sciences venture capital firm, while dedicating his ""spare time"" and resources to his volunteer job as the foundation's chairman. He oversees 10 scleroderma research programs; works with pharmaceutical companies, researchers and physicians on new medications and treatments;  and reviews proposals to determine which institutions and researchers will benefit from the foundation's average annual dispersal of more than $1 million in research grants. ""The patients out there are counting on me. I want to deliver for them,"" Evnin said.  Watch Delany talk about some effects of scleroderma and Evnin's strides toward a cure » . Since Evnin joined the Scleroderma Research Foundation, more than $10 million has been raised for  research and many world-renowned scientists and research programs are joining the search for a cure. ""We've made inroads and there are new therapies and treatments for patients that can change their lives,"" said Evnin. Delany said Evnin gives much of his own money toward research, and she calls his efforts and accomplishments on behalf of the thousands of scleroderma patients ""nothing less than heroic.""

"(CNN) -- A U.S. federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted Joran van der Sloot on charges of wire fraud and extortion in connection with a plot to sell information about the whereabouts of Natalee Holloway's remains in exchange for $250,000, officials said. An arrest warrant on these same charges had been issued for van der Sloot earlier this month. The charges are unrelated to the killing of a student in Peru in which van der Sloot is the suspect. He is in Peruvian jail. Wednesday's indictment alleges that van der Sloot exploited ""Beth Holloway's fear that she would never find her daughter's body or know what happened to her unless she paid him $250,000,"" the Alabama U.S. Attorney's office said. The Dutchman is accused of making false promises that he would reveal the location of Natalee Holloway's body if the money was transferred to him. According to the indictment, Beth Holloway wired $15,000 to a bank account van der Sloot held in the Netherlands, and through an attorney gave him an additional $10,000 in person. Once he had the initial $25,000, van der Sloot showed the attorney, John Kelly, where Natalee Holloway's remains allegedly were hidden. It turned out to be false information, the indictment states. The indictment seeks for van der Sloot to forfeit $25,100, which includes $100 Beth Holloway initially transferred to van der Sloot to confirm his account. ""I want to applaud the FBI's work on this case,"" U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance said. ""Because of the agents' dedicated efforts, we are able to bring charges against someone who sought profit in a mother's grief."" In Peru, van der Sloot's attorney on Wednesday filed an appeal to a ruling that upheld the admissibility of his confession and the legality of his detention in the death of Stephany Flores, 21. One month after his daughter's killing, Peruvian businessman Ricardo Flores met with a judge Wednesday to give a formal statement about the facts surrounding the case, family members told CNN. Ricardo Flores helped search for Stephany Flores when she didn't come home on May 30 after a night out at a casino. Her body was later found in a hotel room in Lima, Peru, registered to Joran van der Sloot.  He's been charged with first-degree murder and robbery in the case. Ricardo Flores' meeting with the judge was his first.  Van der Sloot refused an opportunity earlier this month to give the judge a statement. Flores met with Judge Carlos Morales Cordova in Lima. As the presiding judge, Morales has the duty to be the chief fact-finder, legal experts told CNN. Morales is getting statements from other potential witnesses, as well. Van der Sloot, 22, is trying to slow down the legal process by appealing his incarceration and trying to nullify a confession he gave. One judge already denied his claim, but van der Sloot's attorney said his client will fight all the way to the Peruvian Supreme Court and international courts, if necessary. Wednesday's appeal was the first step. The Flores family will hold a memorial service Wednesday night in Lima to mark the one month anniversary of Stephany Flores' killing. Stephany Flores was an intelligent woman with tremendous ambition for success in business, friends of hers told CNN. She once wrote a list of 23 businesses that she wanted to do well in, and then checked them off one by one as she decided whether she was really interested in pursuing them. She came from a privileged family, but was a humble person who was extremely giving, her friends said. At the time of her death, Stephany Flores had told her friends that she was the happiest that she had ever been in her life, they said. Van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen, was twice arrested in connection with the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, but he has not been charged in that case. Police said van der Sloot admitted that he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail in his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested on June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. Van der Sloot is being held at the Miguel Castro Castro Prison, in a high-security area where only two of the 10 cells are occupied and he has no contact with the general prison population.

"(CNN) -- A jury Friday acquitted W.R. Grace & Company and three of its former executives of having knowingly exposed mine workers and residents of Libby, Montana, to asbestos. The W.R. Grace plant in Libby, Montana, in an undated photograph. ""We at Grace are gratified by today's verdict and thank the men and women of the jury who were open to hearing the facts,"" said Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO of the company in a written statement. ""We always believed that Grace and its former executives had acted properly and that a jury would come to the same conclusion when confronted with the evidence."" Festa said that during the time Grace owned and operated a vermiculite mine in Libby, ""the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day."" The jury began deliberating Thursday and returned its verdict Friday morning. The Department of Justice's response to the verdict, which came after a three-month trial, was measured. ""The jury has spoken, and we thank them for their service,"" said a written statement issued by the office of public affairs. ""We are refraining from further comment at this juncture because one individual awaits trial in connection with this case."" Prosecutors plan to try another executive separately. Asked if the Justice Department plans to appeal, department spokesman Andrew Ames said, ""I wouldn't want to comment on that."" Federal prosecutors had accused the mining company and its executives of exposing Libby's 100,000 residents to asbestos for decades, resulting in more than 200 deaths and 1,000 illnesses. The product covered patches of grass, dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of residents' daily lives. ""There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime,"" said David Uhlmann in an April  interview. He helped spearhead the case when he was the Justice Department's top prosecutor of environmental crimes before stepping down in 2007. During the trial, those who lost loved ones testified at the federal courthouse in Missoula, about 130 miles southeast of Libby, that residents had been kept in the dark about the dangers. Until 1990, W.R. Grace & Company operated a mine in Libby that produced vermiculite, a substance used in all sorts of products, from insulation to fertilizers. The vermiculite was contaminated with tremolite asbestos -- linked to numerous illnesses including mesothelioma, a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart. The government's indictment alleged that W.R. Grace conspired to ""knowingly release"" the asbestos. It said the company tried to hide the dangers from employees and residents, leaving them ""in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury."" ""It was a purpose of the conspiracy to conceal and misrepresent the hazardous nature of the tremolite asbestos contaminated vermiculite, thereby enriching defendants and others,"" the indictment read. The indictment also said W.R. Grace tried to ""defraud the United States and others by impairing, impeding, and frustrating"" the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies once they launched an investigation in 1999. The 10-count indictment included charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. Had it been convicted, the company could have faced criminal fines of up to $280 million, which is twice the value of its profits from the mine. Grace executives, who were named as defendants, could have faced prison time. The company did not deny that asbestos emanated from its plant. Nor did it question that some people had been sickened and killed, though a definitive number of deaths linked to the vermiculite plant probably will never be known. But W.R. Grace denied any kind of conspiracy. In fact, the company said, it acted responsibly and took appropriate steps. It said it had voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents. In the courtroom, defense attorneys noted that the asbestos problem dates back to about 1920, long before W.R. Grace took over the mine in 1963. The attorneys said that, as information about the asbestos came to light, the company took numerous steps to mitigate the dangers and were open about it. Defense attorney David Bernick said he was not surprised by the verdict. ""The evidence showed that what was going on internally with the company was anything but conspiratorial,"" he told said. ""It was responsible."" However, some townspeople did not share Bernick's view. ""I don't see how they could have gotten out of it,"" said Steven Schnetter, who worked at the mine for 17 years until it closed in 1990. Shortly afterward, Schnetter was diagnosed with asbestosis, a lung disease caused by exposure to asbestos fibers. The 60-year-old retiree said he told his managers in the late 1980s that he was concerned to find that tremolite is a form of asbestos. ""They said, 'Oh, yeah, but it's the short-fiber type that won't hurt you,'"" he said. Schnetter settled with the company for a ""small amount,"" he told CNN Friday in a telephone interview. When asked about his frequent coughing, he said, ""I do that all the time. ... My lungs won't expand right.""","Jury acquits W.R. Grace, three former execs in asbestos exposure case .

"(CNN) -- Census workers are in the final stages of going door-to-door to complete the 2010 U.S. census, but some experts are looking further to the future to explore the way Americans work, live and identify themselves. In his new book ""The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050,"" Joel Kotkin offers thoughts on what the census will reveal in the next 40 years, including how migration patterns, population dynamics and cultural diversity will come to shape the portrait of the American landscape. CNN spoke to Kotkin recently on what he says is a lot more change to come. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: You claim that ""the majority in the United States becomes nonwhite by 2050."" The current census has stirred up much controversy in terms of race relations and how we as Americans choose to identify ourselves. How will the nation's ethnic makeup differ in relation to today? Joel Kotkin: There's going to be a very diverse minority population with large amounts of interracial marriage. What we'll see is that the Anglo-Saxon population will no longer be the majority. I believe the mixed-race population will grow the fastest because compared to the past, interracial relationships are increasingly tolerated and considered OK by a large percent of the younger generations. It's no longer strange to see a black and white couple at a restaurant together today. Yet someone visiting from the 1960s would be shocked. CNN: Will negative factors like discrimination because of race be eliminated in the future? Kotkin: I think the racial issue will always be there. Race won't disappear, but it won't be the marker it was at one time. I think that people have a different attitude now. You don't see the kind of concern for racial classifications that we once had. [President] Obama's election was a major turning point in America in defining that. I believe the current attitude will have a cascading effect of all varieties. CNN: How do you believe Americans will identify themselves in 2050? By categories of race or just as Americans? Kotkin: I'm almost sure that these categories of racial or ethnic identification will still be as important as they are now. Historically, people were defined in a binary matter by race. But now more than ever, ethnicity is intertwined with identity and shapes the way people grow, what they believe and their perspectives on a variety of topics. Now, a gay person is the same no matter what race. A conservative is conservative. Thus, these cultural and ethnic backgrounds will be key markers in terms of identity for Americans. CNN: In your book, you describe how the nation's population will grow to be nearly 400 million people in the next 40 years. How exactly will this happen? Kotkin: The fact is that there will be more people in the future because of longevity. People are going to start living longer, immigration will be more feasible in the future, and the United States will have a slightly higher fertility rate than other countries. This will mean more people to count in terms of the census and perhaps considering alternative ways to get that work done. CNN: Your book also describes the idea of America becoming more energy efficient. That's hard to believe with all the current energy and environmental issues affecting our nation today. Kotkin: We are going to have to deal with the energy issue -- I think people just need to be able to see a clear solution that makes some sort of sense. Just look at how far we've come. We've invested billions of new transit systems all over the country, and that's more since 1980. By 2050, most people between the ages of 30 and 70 are going to want to live in single-family homes and [drive] more energy-efficient cars. CNN: Will people be traveling less? Is that how we will contribute to bettering our energy situation? Kotkin: Yes. A lot more people will be working at home or closer to home. This is why suburbs will become the new centers of movement and grounds for change. This is the only real way to deal with it -- trying to tell people that they have to give up their houses, backyards, cars, and live like their grandparents is not a winning solution. Especially when the people pushing for this method, like Al Gore and Prince Charles, live infinitely larger than they could ever imagine living. CNN: So cities will become obsolete? They will no longer be the hub of our planets? Kotkin: Well, if you look at the current status now, 90 percent of jobs are outside of the central core of cities. They won't be completely obsolete -- by 2050, cities will still play a symbolic role in terms of culture, amenities and sports, but they will no longer be one of the dominant places where people live and work. CNN: You also describe how the U.S. will become more economically competitive in the future. How do you -- this to Americans who have seen our current economy slide downward into a recession and aren't convinced about this prediction? Kotkin: The U.S. has relatively younger demographics, which gives it a competitive advantage. This nation attracts people from all over the world, and that's what gives it global advantage; we have the potential to be energy sufficient. We are the only advanced country with a growing population, agricultural surplus, lots of raw materials, significant domestic energy. The nation is entrepreneurial in culture and has a reasonably stable political system. That doesn't mean that the U.S. will be a hegemonic global power, but I believe the economic condition, due to these factors, will definitely improve in the future and the census will reflect that. CNN: Your claims show a positive outcome for the nation amidst all the current issues in the world: war, political instability, the oil spill, lack of resources, unemployment, global warming. What should Americans consider in terms of making these changes happen by 2050? Kotkin: The U.S. has many great advantages going into the next 40 years -- if we do what we need to do. There are serious problems we need to attack in terms of upward mobility and economic growth. If we don't do that and we have a growing population, it will get difficult -- things will get worse and downwardly mobile for the nation.","Author Joel Kotkin predicts that majority of nation will be non-white .

"(Coastal Living) -- The spirit of a mourning mother haunts Heceta Head, a 115-year-old lightstation on the windswept Oregon Coast. Some say the ghost, called The Gray Lady, searches for her infant daughter, who tumbled from the 200-foot cliffs to her death. Heceta Head sits on an isolated stretch of the windswept Oregon Coast. A visitor can get creeped out just by the setting -- an isolated stretch of shore where sudden fog can blot out the sun. Mariners braving the pounding surf depend on the lighthouse to avoid smashing into the rocks below. The beacon, the strongest on the Oregon Coast, is visible 21 miles away at sea. The Gray Lady, usually seen wearing a floor-length gray skirt, lurks in the attic of the lightkeeper's home, which is on the National Register of Historic Places and now operates as a bed-and-breakfast. One worker saw the silver-haired ghost floating over the floorboards as he repaired a broken attic window. He fled, but the next day the shattered glass in the sealed room had been swept into a neat pile. Others report a mischievous side to the spirit. Lights flick on unexpectedly, doors suddenly lock, and objects placed in one room later appear in another. Coastal Living: Top 10 haunted lighthouses . Photographer Steve Terrill of Portland recalls standing outside at dusk and seeing a translucent figure looking down on him from the attic. ""It moved and then it disappeared,"" he says. ""We knew absolutely nobody was in there. I thought, 'Man this is weird. This must be my imagination.'"" Steve and a friend were the only ones staying in the building. The next morning his friend called out in alarm. During the night, the inn's guestbook mysteriously appeared in his room. It was open to a page describing a previous lodger's encounter with the spirit. ""I don't know where that book came from,"" Steve says. ""I'm getting goosebumps now just thinking about it.""

"(CNN) -- The World Cup will have a new winner on Sunday after Spain beat Germany 1-0 to set up a mouthwatering clash with the Netherlands. Spain's hero was Barcelona defender Carles Puyol as his 73rd minute header secured his country's first ever World Cup final. Puyol rose highest to power Xavi's corner into the net and hand Spain a deserved victory. Vicente del Bosque's team dominated possession against their opponents and should have won by a more convincing score line but they couldn't convert their chances. Blog: Durban atmosphere fell flat . Germany only created a handful of opportunities as they attempted to avenge their defeat to Spain in the European Championships final of 2008 but they failed to regularly test Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain will now face Netherlands at Soccer City in Johannesburg on Sunday after they beat Uruguay 3-2 in the other semifinal on Tuesday night. SI.com: Three quick thoughts . Liverpool striker Fernando Torres was dropped in favor of Pedro Rodriguez as Spain made one change from their quarterfinal team. Germany drafted in Piotr Trochowski in place of the suspended Thomas Muller. It was Barcelona striker David Villa who had the first chance of the game but his effort was smothered by Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Puyol was the next to go close for Spain after he headed Andres Iniesta's powerful cross over the bar. Lukas Podolski registered Germany's first effort on goal just after the half hour mark as Spain keeper Iker Casillas turned his shot round the post. Just before the break Mesut Özil went down under a challenge from Sergio Ramos but the referee waved away his appeal for a penalty. Spain stepped it up a gear after halftime and Xabi Alonso came close with a fierce shot from the edge of the area that flashed past the post. Pedro was next to shoot but Neuer blocked his effort before Iniesta rolled a pass across the goal line with Villa agonizingly close to tapping home. Substitute Toni Kroos nearly scored with his first touch for Germany as he was found by a Podolski cross but Casillas parried his volley. But just four minutes later Spain were in front. Xavi's corner was met by Puyol, and his header sped past Neuer. In Madrid, relief and rejoicing intertwine . As Germany tried to force an equalizer Spain should have made the game safe but Pedro failed to tee up Torres when the striker had a clear run on goal.

"(CNN) -- The recent flotilla incident is the culmination of a steep decline in Israeli-Turkish relations that started with the Gaza war in 2008 and 2009. Relations between these two countries, after reaching a high point in the late 1990s and early 2000s, are now beyond repair, and it will probably take the better part of a decade for them to be resuscitated. Turkey has also used its increasingly rancorous disputes with Israel to advance its status in the Middle East at the expense of traditional leaders across the region. Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002, was always conflicted in its relations with Israel. The party emerged from a hardcore anti-Western and anti-Israeli Islamist tradition that had close ties to Hamas and Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. As it rose to power, however, the AKP distanced itself from these positions and even embraced the idea of joining the European Union. Still, it always maintained a critical stance when it came to Israel that was punctuated by occasional outbursts. Turkey's relations with Israel improved when the AKP stepped into the vacuum created in the Middle East by the Bush administration's policies and orchestrated secret negotiations between Israel and Syria. This effort fit well with the AKP's grand vision of its foreign policy -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party were intent in making Turkey an important international player. After punching below its weight for far too long, Ankara thought now was the time to engage in an activist policy and capitalize on its economic prowess and strategic geopolitical location. It aggressively sought a role in international institutions such as the U.N. Security Council and engaged in all kinds of diplomatic efforts from the Middle East to the Balkans and the Caucasus. Erdogan and Turkey received many kudos for the Israeli-Syrian talks. But they came to an abrupt end with Israel's Gaza war. Erdogan felt personally betrayed by then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in Ankara four days before launching the Gaza offensive. From then on, Turkish foreign policy vis-à-vis Israel was dramatically transformed. We first saw this at the January 2009 Davos meetings in Switzerland when Erdogan publicly confronted Israel's President Shimon Peres and then walked off the stage. Positive reactions to his behavior in Turkey and in the Middle East provided Erdogan with the contours of Ankara's new foreign policy. From then on, in almost every foreign policy speech, Erdogan would disparage Israel's policy in Gaza, calling the Gaza Strip an open prison. He then began to challenge Israel's nuclear arms while defending Iran against the West. In a deliberate obfuscation of the issues, he argued that instead of criticizing Iran's peaceful nuclear program, it was Israel's not-so-secret nuclear arsenal that ought to be the object of censure. This, of course, is a distortion of the truth as Iran was accused of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which it is a signatory while Israel is not. His singling out of Israel was purposeful but unfair; he never criticized Turkish ally Pakistan -- or India for that matter-- for having tested and deployed nuclear arms. The flotilla crisis occurred in this atmosphere of great tension. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu claims his government cautioned the Islamist charity that organized the flotilla not to cross into Israeli waters and that they were powerless to prevent an independent, non-government organization (NGO) from acting on its own volition. Yet there are many signs that the AKP and other Turkish Islamist parties were fully supportive of the NGO and its efforts. Hamas itself interpreted the action as an Erdogan-led effort to breach the naval blockade of Gaza. No one, including the Israelis, could have anticipated the extent of the fallout, although a cursory look at what the organizers were claiming should have made it obvious that the NGO was clearly trying to provoke Israel and elicit an strong response. Ultimately, it is the incompetence of the Israeli decision-makers who failed to properly analyze the groups' intentions that in many ways handed the AKP, Erdogan and Hamas a public relations victory. Erdogan has now become a hero in the Arab street. In two years, he has managed to do what few Arab leaders could do -- push Israel into a corner. Even though Arab countries have been mistrustful of Turkey in the past, Erdogan has successfully transformed himself into the leader of the Middle East. He is not just the defender of traditional Arab concerns but also of Iran, as he is resisting the Obama administration's efforts to impose sanctions on Iran. The emerging hostility in Israeli-Turkish relations puts the United States in a difficult quandary. Washington does not want to side with one ally over another, and Turkey has aggressively been pushing the United States to do just that. Washington, however, has issues with both countries. It is upset at Turkish efforts to protect Iran from further U.N. sanctions and at Israel for making its regional diplomacy so much more difficult, not only with the flotilla fiasco but also with its hard line on the settlements and negotiations with the Palestinians. Turkey may therefore emerge as an even more significant factor in an already complicated Middle East political tapestry. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Henri J. Barkey.","Turkey's relations with Israel have grown increasingly tense, says Henri Barkey .

"Washington (CNN) -- The images couldn't have been better if Benjamin Netanyahu designed them himself. After months of leveling humiliating criticism at the Israeli prime minister, here was President Obama calling Netanyahu a man of peace, speaking of the ""unbreakable"" bond between the United States and Israel and essentially giving Israel a green light to skirt transparency in its suspected nuclear program, citing its ""unique security requirements."" Gone were the bitter recriminations and the harsh demands to stop all settlement activity in the West Bank. Instead there was praise for the Israeli government for ""working through layers of various governmental entities and jurisdiction"" and showing ""restraint"" over the past several months. To put an even finer point on the fact that the recent tension was a thing of the past and the two leaders were once again bosom buddies (actually, they never were, but they seem to be now), Obama even walked Netanyahu to his car after the meeting. The images were a marked contrast to Netanyahu's last visit in March. Then, there was no press conference or even a photo-op, and it was widely viewed as a snub after the Israeli announcement of new settlement plans for mostly Arab East Jerusalem during Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Israel. The new message of unity made clear that the relationship between the United States and Israel, and that of their two leaders, was back on track. It was the culmination of a new narrative months in the making. As he did with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Obama found his ""tough love"" approach toward Netanyahu was proving counterproductive. The U.S. push for a new United Nations Security Council resolution on Iran, Obama's recent signing of legislation imposing fresh U.S. sanctions against Tehran and his administration's efforts to push back pressure for an international investigation into the Gaza flotilla raid, which killed nine Turks, all helped to mend fences with Israel. Netanyahu's delegation left Washington satisfied that Obama understands Israel's security needs. But beyond the change in tone evident for the cameras lies a series of contentious issues the United States and Israel will have to confront over the next several months. The details of what happens next are murky and could lead to renewed tensions in the fall when the 10-month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank ends. Both leaders agreed on the need to move from so-called ""proximity talks,"" essentially consisting of shuttle diplomacy by Obama's Mideast envoy George Mitchell, to direct talks. But the conundrum is that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to restart direct talks without a full settlement freeze, while Netanyahu is resisting extending the existing ban until talks start. Obama set a deadline when he said talks should begin before the freeze ends in September, suggesting it could create a climate of trust building ""in which everybody feels a greater investment in success."" The leaders also spoke of ""confidence-building measures"" both the Israelis and the Palestinians could take to create a better atmosphere for direct talks. Obama wants Israel to ""widen the scope"" of Palestinian security control in the West Bank beyond the current few cities, citing advances made by Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. But it is unclear Israel is confident enough to expand Palestinian responsibilities. Obama went out on a limb Tuesday, saying unequivocally that he trusts Netanyahu. The assumption is that he must have gotten some assurances in private from Netanyahu about steps he is willing to take. But it was clear from Netanyahu's remarks that the peace process isn't issue No. 1 for him. Obama administration officials before the meeting, and Obama himself during his press availability with Netanyahu, emphasized that moving to direct talks was the most important issue on the agenda. But in Netanyahu's remarks, the peace process rated a distant third to Iran and issues of Israel's security. If direct talks don't begin soon, experts believe the possibility of a breakthrough becomes less likely. The Palestinians are almost certain to refuse to sit down if the settlement freeze is not extended. And as the U.S. midterm elections approach, Netanyahu could gamble on Republicans making gains and weakening Obama's hand. Netanyahu himself is facing domestic hurdles, which make playing for time in his best interests. The hope is that Tuesday's summit enabled the leaders to build a partnership which can help them move forward on the peace process. The proof of that will come at the first bump on the rocky road to September, when daylight appears between these two new best friends.","Images from Obama, Netanyahu meeting were a marked contrast to Netanyahu's last visit .

"(CNN) -- A man police wanted to question in the abduction of a 4-year-old Missouri girl shot himself as investigators approached him, authorities in St. Louis reported Wednesday. The girl, Alisa Maier, was found alive Tuesday night in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton, about 70 miles south of her Mississippi River hometown of Louisiana, Missouri. Her parents identified her from a photograph sent by police there, her grandfather, Roy Harrison, said Wednesday night. ""You couldn't miss the big brown eyes,"" Harrison told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" But the search went on for the man who abducted her, who was seen driving a dark-colored, four-door sedan with missing wheel covers and a loud muffler. A tip led police to the town of Hawk Point, about 45 miles south of Louisiana, where police found a car parked outside a home that roughly matched that description, Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Al Nothum said. Before police could speak to the man, ""He pulled out a gun and shot himself."" Nothum said. ""We are not saying this is our suspect,"" he added. ""We are saying he is a person of interest."" Investigators are still treating the case as open, and will continue to take tips until the facts are nailed down, he said. There were preliminary reports after the shooting that the man had died, but Nothum said Wednesday night that the man was in critical condition. Nothum would not provide any more information about the man or his condition. Alisa was snatched from the front yard of her home Monday evening as she played with her 6-year-old brother. Harrison said his granddaughter is ""a bright young girl"" who has talked ""a little bit"" with her parents about her abduction. ""As to what she's relaying to them, we don't know,"" he said. ""They're staying down there close to the headquarters they've got down there in St. Louis now, so they're able to get people to her, to talk to her."" Anita McKlevis, a neighbor, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that the town of about 4,000 was overjoyed by the girl's safe return. ""It was like someone gave us all $1 million,"" McKlevis said. ""Everybody is so happy for this little girl and the family. We are going to stick by the family. That's important."" McKlevis said she sent cupcakes to the family's home, ""because I know she loves them."" And Harrison said the family was ""ecstatic"" over Alisa's safe return. ""I've told people earlier, if I could do a backflip, I would,"" he said. ""When we get her back and get the family together, we're gonna have a barbecue and togetherness, and hugs and kisses. I couldn't be any happier."" Alisa was discovered near a gas station car wash after witnesses saw her walking away from the sedan. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.","Man is wanted for questioning in abduction of 4-year-old .

"(CNN) -- Tracy Orr sat in the back of the room and prepared to watch her foreclosed home go up for auction this past Saturday. That's when a pesky stranger sat down beside her and struck up a conversation. Tracy Orr faced losing her home to foreclosure when Marilyn Mock, a stranger, stepped in to buy it. ""Are you here to buy a house?"" Marilyn Mock said. Orr couldn't hold it in. The tears flowed. She pointed to the auction brochure at a home that didn't have a picture. ""That's my house,"" she said. Within moments, the four-bedroom, two-bath home in Pottsboro, Texas, went up for sale. People up front began casting their bids. The home that Orr purchased in September 2004 was slipping away. She stood and moved toward the crowd. Behind her, Mock got into the action. ""She didn't know I was doing it,"" Mock says. ""I just kept asking her if [her home] was worth it, and she just kept crying. She probably thought I was crazy, 'Why does this woman keep asking me that?' "" Mock says she bought the home for about $30,000. That's when Mock did what most bidders at a foreclosure auction never do.  Watch why a woman would buy back a stranger's home » . ""She said, 'I did this for you. I'm doing this for you,' "" Orr says. ""When it was all done, I was just in shock."" ""I thought maybe her and her husband do these types of things to buy them and turn them. She said, 'No, you just look like you needed a friend.' "" ""All this happened within like 5 minutes. She never even asked me my name. She didn't ask me my financial situation. She had no idea what [the house] looked like. She just did it out of the graciousness of her heart, just a 'Good Samaritan,' "" Orr says. ""It's amazing."" Orr says she had taken out a mortgage of $80,000 in 2004 when she first bought the home. At the time, she says she worked for the U.S. Postal Service. But  she lost her job a month after taking out the loan when she says the Post Office fired her over a DWI while off-duty. She says a wrongful termination lawsuit is pending. Without a job, she fell behind on her home payments. She sold some property in 2006 for $12,000 and paid it to the mortgage company, thinking she had done enough to save herself from foreclosure -- but to no avail, she says. ""It's just been a bad deal,"" says Orr, who now works at All Saints Camp and Conference Center, a Christian group with ties to the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas, Texas. With the foreclosure auction approaching, she planned to make the nearly 80-mile drive to Dallas this past Saturday with an investor friend. But she says he ditched her at the last-minute. She went to the auction with her family, and suddenly found herself in the back with Mock. ""I always talk to everyone around me,"" Mock says. ""I mean you can always find out all kinds of interesting things when you talk to people around you. So I just asked her, 'Are you here to buy a house?' "" Mock, who is known as the ""Rock Lady"" for her small business selling flagstone and other rocks in Rockwall, Texas, says she went to the auction with her 27-year-old son to help him buy his first home. He bought his home, and soon afterward Mock came across Orr. Mock says she's using one of her business dump trucks as collateral for the $30,000 sale price. ""I can't afford to just give [the house] to her,"" she says. As for Orr's payments, Mock says, ""We'll just figure out however much she can pay on it. That way, she can have her house back."" Why be so generous? ""She was just so sad. You put yourself in their situation and you realize you just got to do something,"" says Mock, who says she has trouble walking by homeless people on the street and not helping them out. ""If it was you, you'd want somebody to stop and help you."" When she told her husband of 30 years that she'd just bought a home for a stranger, she says his reaction was: ""Whatever."" ""He's used to it,"" she says with a booming laugh. Mock says she's excited for another reason too. Orr's house is located near a Texas fishing hot-spot. ""She says I can come up there and fish, and I love to fish!"" Orr, who nearly lost her home, says her newfound friend has ""given me back faith and hope to keep going and hold my head up."" ""Things happen for a reason,"" Orr says.","Stranger buys foreclosed home for woman on hard times .

"(CNN) -- A tourist boat with more than 30 people on board overturned on the Delaware River at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Wednesday after it was hit by a barge, Philadelphia police and the Coast Guard said. ""We confirmed that there were 37 people on board, 35 passengers and two crew. As of right now we have confirmed that 35 people have been recovered. There are two people missing,"" said David Umberger, the Coast Guard's civilian search and rescue controller for the area, shortly after the accident. The two missing people are a 16-year-old female and a 20-year-old male, Lt. Frank Vanore of the Philadelphia Police Department told reporters later Wednesday afternoon. Vanore said that the boat had ""mechanical trouble"" and the engine shut down after a fire on board. While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday night it had  sent an investigative team to the scene. The Coast Guard's Umberger said the search was continuing for the missing. ""We have all of our port partners engaged in that search-and-rescue case, including the state police, Philly police, fire department, good samaritans and the Coast Guard,"" he said. Deputy Commissioner William  Blackburn of the Philadelphia police told CNN  that searchers located the boat in  about 50 feet of murky water but it was too dangerous to send divers down. The  boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said, adding that it has  been marked by a  buoy and divers will be sent down when it is deemed safe. One area hospital, Hahnemann University Hospital, reported eight patients -- two adults, three children, three teenagers -- were brought in after the incident. Two other passengers on the boat also were taken to the hospital but declined treatment, Hahnemann Hospital spokeswoman Coleen Cannon said. Of the eight patients, one adult and two children were discharged a few hours after the incident, she said.

"(CNN) -- Anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune was given a two-year suspended prison sentence and five years' probation Wednesday by a Tokyo district court judge for his role in boarding a Japanese whaling ship. Bethune was found guilty on five charges, ranging from assault against whalers to trespassing into a whaling vessel. Bethune had previously pleaded guilty to all charges but assault. He could have received up to 15 years behind bars on charges. Bethune testified during his trial in May that he had no intention of hurting anyone when he protested Japan's whale hunt. The New Zealand activist from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said that he believed the bottles of butyric acid he threw at the Shonan Maru 2 whaling ship were non-toxic and would not harm anyone. Prosecutors said the butyric acid burned two crew members of the Japanese whaling fleet, but Sea Shepherd called it a harmless, albeit rancid, liquid. Butyric acid is found in rancid butter and vomit. At the May hearing, he tearfully described the January collision between the Shonan Maru 2 and the Sea Shepherd's multi-million-dollar speedboat, the Ady Gil. The crash sunk the Ady Gil, which Bethune captained. Weeks later, Bethune jumped aboard the Shonan Maru 2 and attempted to make a citizen's arrest of the captain. He was arrested and brought back to Japan to face criminal charges. ""I admit that I boarded the Shonan Maru, but I believe that I have good reason to do so,"" he said. ""I admit that I fired the butyric acid."" Bethune's case is the first time a Sea Shepherd activist has been tried in a Japanese criminal court in the group's long-running battle with Japan's whalers in the icy waters of the Antarctic. ""It's encouraged us. It's certainly motivated us, and we're going back to the Southern Ocean with far more support than ever,"" said Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd founder. ""I hope that we'll be much more effective because of it."" ""Pete Bethune is a hero in New Zealand,"" Watson added. ""He's a hero worldwide to people who want to see the end of whaling."" Japan annually hunts whales in the Antarctic, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the loophole that a country may legally do so if its purpose is scientific research. Sea Shepherd has claimed the science argument is a sham, noting that the whale meat then gets sold in Japanese markets and served in restaurants. ""They're targeting endangered whales in an established international whale sanctuary in violation of the Antarctic treaty,"" Watson said. ""They're criminals.""

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- ""I met my mentor before I knew what a mentor was or that I would ever need one,"" says Debra Yergen of Yakima, Washington. Fresh out of college and conducting an interview at a hotel in Seattle as a freelance journalist, Yergen ""just connected"" with the establishment's public relations director. By the end of the day, the woman asked if Yergen would like to have her as a mentor. Yergen agreed, wanting to be cordial, but ""had no idea what this meant."" What it turned out to mean was a 15-year relationship during which Yergen's mentor gently guided, inspired, opened doors and offered introductions. ""Over the years, she taught me more than I learned in any one college course or in any one job. She was my lighthouse through every professional opportunity and storm,"" Yergen says. While a person doesn't absolutely need a mentor, workers who have found one are often glad they did. What a mentor can offer . Elizabeth Freedman, author of ""Work 101: Learning the Ropes of the Workplace Without Hanging Yourself"" and ""The MBA Student's Job-Seeking Bible,"" says that some of the possible benefits of having a mentor include: . Shortening your career learning curve: Most of us opt to work with mentors who have been around the block a few more times than we have, and this is a smart idea. When we work with someone who has more industry knowledge and expertise, or simply knows the ropes better than we do, we're giving ourselves (and our careers) tremendous advantage. Improving your network of contacts: Picture everyone in your Outlook folder or contact file -- and now double it. That's what working with a mentor can do to the number of professional relationships, sales leads or other contacts in your life. Telling you what nobody else will: A good mentor won't hold back. This isn't to suggest you want to work with a mentor who is overly critical or harsh when it comes to giving feedback, but a successful relationship will provide you with honest advice and candid opinions. Where to find one . While there are cases like Yergen's where an established worker clearly offers to serve as a mentor, the relationship often develops more informally within the workplace. Drew Tarvin of New York City, who works in information technology project management in the consumer goods industry, met the person destined to be his mentor while serving an internship. ""He was my manager when I was an intern. After getting hired full time and switching managers, it seemed natural to still talk to him on some frequency,"" Tarvin says. ""Since then, our conversations have evolved not just to discussions in our certain area but career guidance, handling the political environment and work/life balance. Professional associations, alumni gatherings and industry events are also good places to find potential mentors. Annette Pelliccio, founder of The Happy Gardener, and organic garden and lawn care company, met her mentor four years ago at a direct-selling convention. Nowadays, she says, ""My company probably would be nonexistent without him."" In today's tech-savvy world, some find mentors via LinkedIn, Brightfuse and other business/social groups. During a time of unemployment, Pamela Bodley went online searching for information on how to be a good leader and came across a website that spoke to exactly what she needed. ""I contacted the leadership expert who wrote the site, explained my situation and asked if he would mentor me,"" Bodley recalls. ""Now, five months later, we speak every week or two on specific business topics, and I have been learning great concepts, skills and techniques."" Building the relationship . While directly asking someone to be your mentor can work, Freedman cautions that sometimes it is best to avoid labels, go slow and let the relationship grow. ""Even if getting a mentor is what you're going for, remember that the relationship is a two-way street, and like you, your mentor is probably reluctant to spend his limited free time on someone who isn't right for him."" She suggests instead identifying who has the kind of career you'd like, who seems approachable and who is able to spend some time with you. Then, once you've found a good candidate, ""Reach out: 'John, would you have a few minutes to grab a cup of coffee? I'd love to learn more about your work and how you've been successful within the company.'"" It might be the most worthwhile coffee break of your career. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010.

"(CNN) -- Citing air safety, the European Commission Tuesday expanded restrictions on Iran Air's operations by banning more types of aircraft. The commission banned Iran Air from flying its fleet of Airbus A-320 and of Boeing B-727 and B-747 planes into European airports. It said it would continue to monitor Iran Air and work with the airline to improve standards. ""We cannot afford to compromise on air safety,"" said Siim Kallas, the commission's vice president. The commission also banned a carrier from Suriname and removed two Indonesian airlines from its banned list.

"(CNN) -- Rough seas are delaying the connection of the vessel Helix Producer to the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, a spokesman at the oil cleanup command center in Louisiana said Wednesday. The linkup ""may be in place by Saturday,"" he said. Officials have said that the hookup is partially completed despite the bad weather, but once it is done it could draw up to 53,000 barrels of oil a day. But Charles Gaiennie of the Unified Command's Joint Information Center in Houma, Louisiana, says the current ""sea state"" is delaying the operation and that many Louisiana cleanup activities, such as skimming and flights delivering aerial dispersants, have been ""stood down"" because of the rough weather. He said that if there's is ""a window of opportunity to deploy [resources], we will do so."" Newly retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told reporters Wednesday it will be 24 to 48 hours before the sea calms enough to finish the linkup. Allen also told reporters that relief wells must be drilled an estimated 200 to 225 feet farther before they intercept the leaking well bore. He said that officials still expect that the relief wells will not be completed until August. Meanwhile, the number of cleanup workers reporting adverse health effects continues to rise. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down Wednesday for an exclusive interview with the man in charge of BP's medical response, Dr. Kevin O'Shea. He said more than 1,500 workers have sought medical care through BP, a significant increase from previously reported numbers. On Wednesday, the advocacy group ""Alliance for Justice"" released a report on oil industry ties among 5th Circuit Judges.  The report comes ahead of oral arguments set to begin Thursday in Hornbeck Offshore Services v. Salazar, the case that challenged the Obama administration's six-month ban on deep-water drilling. AJR's 9-page report claims that many Appellate Court judges have extensive ties to the oil industry, including Jerry Edwin Smith, William Eugene Davis and James L. Dennis, the three judges who will hear the administration's appeal of the drilling moratorium. The group also says District Judge Martin Feldman, who issued the order prohibiting the drilling moratorium, has financial interests in oil drilling companies. Oral arguments for Hornbeck v. Salazar will begin Thursday afternoon at the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Meanwhile, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindall joined Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu on a flyover of affected areas, including the barrier islands, Port Fouchan, Grand Isle and the Mississippi River. The tour lasted about 90 minutes. And in Mississippi, state authorities report that they've received eight of the nine skimmers produced in France. Officials have closed more beaches in Hancock County and continue to press cleanup efforts. Officials say 550 bags -- amounting to 8,250 pounds of oil-related debris -- have been cleaned from a mile-long stretch of beach in Waveland. Federal estimates say between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels (about 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf daily since April 22, when the Deepwater Horizon sank two days after an explosion aboard the drilling rig. In early June, during an exclusive 48-hour embed with Allen, CNN's Kyra Phillips visited the site of the oil disaster and gained access to the Development Driller III -- the rig that is drilling the primary relief well some 16,000 to 18,000 feet below the sea floor. ""The intention is to intercept the well bore, well down below the surface near the reservoir, then pump heavy mud in to counteract the pressure of the oil coming up,"" Allen said. ""That will allow them to basically plug or kill the well. Once that's done, you could do things like remove the blowout preventer, bring it to the surface and try to find out what happened."" Also, a massive airship, or blimp, and a sea vessel that can suck oil out of the ruptured well are expected to arrive in the Gulf region at the end of the week to aid in oil disaster response efforts. Their arrival is being delayed because of rough weather, said Stephanie Hebert, spokeswoman for the cleanup effort. The U.S. Navy airship will be used to detect oil, direct skimming ships and look for wildlife that may be threatened by oil, the Coast Guard says. It had been scheduled to reach the Gulf on Tuesday. The 178-foot-long blimp, known as the MZ-3A, can carry a crew of up to 10. It will fly slowly over the region to track where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore. The Navy says the advantage of the blimp over current helicopter surveillance operations is that it can stay aloft longer, with lower fuel costs, and can survey a wider area. The Coast Guard has already been pinpointing traveling pools of oil from the sky. ""The aircraft get on top of the oil. They can identify what type of oil it is and they can vector in the skimmer vessels right to the spot,"" Coast Guard Capt. Brian Kelley said. But the problem since June 30 has been the ability to clean it up before it approaches land. Bad weather has made that task more difficult. Fears over the spill now extend all the way to Florida's Atlantic shores. Small tar balls continued to wash ashore Wednesday at Cocoa Beach, just south of Cape Canaveral. The U.S. Coast Guard collected samples that will be tested for any connection to BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill, according to Brevard County spokeswoman Kimberly Prosser. Tar balls that washed ashore two weeks ago were not found to be connected to BP's oil spill, she said. Officials told CNN the test results from the samples collected would not be available for seven to 10 days. Meanwhile, Bob Grantham, spokesman for TMT Offshore Group, said progress has been made in testing the company's A Whale oil skimmer, the world's largest. The delay from high seas ""has allowed us to make valuable observations and to develop some additional technological innovations designed to improve the channeling of oily water into the ship's large capacity tanks,"" Grantham said in a statement issued Tuesday. ""Over the next few days, we will have our first real opportunity to test the new technology under conditions that we hope will maximize the effectiveness of collection and ultimately decanting."" Earlier, officials said A Whale's abilities so far are ""inconclusive,"" meaning the massive converted oil tanker -- which is 3.5 football fields long -- has yet to prove its Taiwanese owner's claim that it can skim between 15,000 and 50,000 barrels of oil off the sea in a day. The Coast Guard said the testing period for the A Whale has been extended through Thursday. Meanwhile, interfaith leaders prayed for restoration and renewal for the Gulf of Mexico as they prepared for a tour of the oil-soaked marshes, wetlands and rookeries of the Louisiana coast Wednesday. The Christian, Jewish and Muslim clergy joined ""in prayer and commitment to the communities most affected by the BP oil disaster,"" Tuesday night, a Sierra Club statement said. Wives of current and former major league baseball players also fanned out across southern Louisiana to draw attention to the people and creatures affected by the disaster. The members of the Baseball Wives Charitable Foundation -- many of them from the Gulf -- toured beaches hit by oil and spoke with fishing and oil industry workers in Grand Isle on Tuesday . ""The initial point of this trip was to raise awareness,"" said Megan Thomas, wife of ex-big league slugger Frank Thomas.  ""We want to take things we've seen here firsthand home with us and create our own fundraisers and keep the awareness out there."" Jamie Buehrle, wife of Chicago White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle, said she was struck by Gulf residents who now fear their finances are in ruins. ""Just seeing the people today who are so scared of the unknown,"" Buehrle said.  ""Not knowing if they are going to get another check, if they are going to work again."" The wives will attend a minor league baseball game between the New Orleans Zephyrs and the Omaha Royals on Wednesday. The team is selling discount tickets for $5 for fishing industry workers and others affected by the disaster. Jessica Maholm, wife of Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Maholm, is from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. ""This (oil disaster) is something that's not going to affect just the Gulf coastal areas,"" she said. ""It's going to affect the whole country with the seafood, the animals and the ecosystem.""

"(CNN) -- Flash floods caused by persistent heavy rains in Oklahoma have claimed the life of a 13-year-old girl, the state medical examiner's office told CNN Friday morning. The unidentified teenager went missing on Thursday after playing with friends at a drainage ditch in the Durant area, according to Cherokee Ballard, the office's spokeswoman. Durant is less than two hours north of Dallas, Texas. Heavy rains have battered the Oklahoma area in recent days. A dramatic rescue captured Thursday in Oklahoma City by a CNN affiliate camera crew showed firefighters trudge through waist-high muddy floodwater to grab a trapped motorist out of his submerged car. Oklahoma Battalion Fire Chief Brian Stanaland said the motorist did not need medical attention. The girl is the third child to be swept away in Oklahoma flooding in less than a week. Rescuers searched for a 13-year-old boy earlier this week who they feared had drowned after falling into a creek swollen by heavy rains. Emergency crews Tuesday were able to fish a 14-year-old boy who fell into Lightning Creek out of the rushing waters, said Cecil Clay, chief of the Oklahoma City Fire Department. A flash flood warning remained in effect in several central Oklahoma counties Friday, the National Weather Service said.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A Russian researcher convicted of spying for U.S. intelligence services could soon be part of an exchange for suspects in a recent Russian spy scandal in the United States, his mother and brother told CNN Wednesday. Svetlana Sutyagina confirmed to CNN that her son, Igor Sutyagin, said he will be released from jail and sent to London, England, by way of Vienna, Austria, on Thursday. According to Svetlana Sutyagina, her son was on a list of 11 names submitted by the United States for the exchange of the Russians detained in the United States in an alleged spy ring. She said her son remembers just one other name on this list -- Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer sentenced for spying. Igor Sutyagin was convicted in 2004 of passing secret data to members of U.S. intelligence services acting as employees of a British company called Alternative Futures, in exchange for monetary rewards in 1998-1999. In Washington, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs offered no further information on a possible swap. ""I don't have anything on that,"" Gibbs said, calling the situation a ""law enforcement matter "" and referring questions to the Department of Justice. Dean Boyd, spokesman for the National Security Division at the U.S. Department of Justice, also had no comment on the case. Meanwhile, a senior law enforcement official told CNN that five suspected Russian spies arrested in Virginia and Massachusetts in late June are being taken to New York, where the other five suspects in the case were arrested. The official, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name, said the U.S. Marshals Service was moving three individuals from Alexandria, Virginia, and two from Boston, Massachusetts, to New York, . An arraignment hearing for all 10 of the suspects arrested in the United States was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in New York. The attorney's office also announced that one of the suspects, Vicky Pelaez, would have a bail hearing on Friday after the U.S. District Court in New York granted a government request to stop her bail order. Earlier, a lawyer for Pelaez had said he expected her to be released on bail Wednesday. In Moscow, Sutyagin's mother and his younger brother, Dmitry, visited him Wednesday in Moscow's Lefortovo prison, where, they said, he told them of the plans for the exchange. Relating the details her son provided, the mother said he was forced to sign a paper in which he pleaded guilty to spying, something he has previously refused to do. She couldn't say what other conditions there would be for his release. The family doesn't know why Sutyagin is being sent to Britain. He has no relatives, friends or acquaintances there and no place to stay, they said. Russian security officers haven't said why they chose Britain for a destination. Dmitry Sutyagin said ""no explanation was given whatsoever."" ""He was told he's flying to Vienna, where people from London will meet him at the airport and then take him further to London,"" Dmitry Sutyagin said. ""He doesn't consider this as a release from prison but more like an exile, an extradition from the country,"" he added, saying that his brother ""is being left with a Russian passport, he remains a Russian citizen. Legally, [his release] will be formalized as a pardon after which he leaves the country voluntarily."" Dmitry Sutyagin also said the deal hinged on his brother admitting guilt. ""He has never pleaded guilty because he was taking all the information from open sources. He did Russian press reviews on defense production issues, etc., and passed it on to a British consulting company, Alternative Futures,"" Dmitry Sutyagin told CNN. Ernst Chyorny, a member of the Public Committee in Defense of Scientists in Russia, said Igor Sutyagin's mother also told him about the possibility of a swap. Chyorny said Sutyagin recently had been transferred from his prison camp in Russia's northern Archangel region to the Moscow facility. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian news agencies reported that Sutyagin may be swapped along with other individuals in exchange for the people suspected of spying for Russia and detained in the United States. The news was attributed to Sutyagin's lawyer, Anna Stavitskaya.  But Chyorny told CNN that Stavitskaya learned this from Sutyagin's relatives, too. The Moscow City Court convicted Sutyagin for high treason through spying and sentenced him to 15 years in prison on April 7, 2004. The Russian Supreme Court later upheld the sentence on appeal. Sutyagin worked at the Moscow-based Institute for U.S. and Canada of the Russian Academy of Sciences and studied defense and political issues. Neither the Russian Federal Security Service nor the Foreign Ministry had any comment regarding Sutyagin's possible exchange. The U.S. State Department says human rights organizations regard Sutyagin as a political prisoner. ""Some observers agreed that he had no access to classified information and described the severe sentence as an effort to discourage citizens from sharing sensitive information with professional colleagues from other countries,"" the State Department said in a report. On Wednesday morning, judges in Boston and Alexandria ordered five of the Russian spy ring suspects to be moved to New York for more proceedings. The Boston judge made the ruling in the case of Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley, while a federal judge in Alexandria ordered that suspects Mikhail Semenko, Michael Zottoli, and Patricia Mills also be moved to New York. In all, 11 suspects have been indicted by U.S. prosecutors in the alleged spy ring case. Ten of them were arrested in the United States in late June, and the other was detained in Cyprus and then released on bail. His whereabouts are unknown.","NEW: Bail hearing set for Friday for one suspect in Russian spy case .

"(CNN) -- Warnings from the National Weather Service about excessive temperatures in the Northeast remain in place through Thursday, as temperatures approached or surpassed the 100-degree mark for a second consecutive day Wednesday in many states. An ""excessive heat watch"" will remain in effect through Thursday afternoon in parts of Delaware, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The weather service says that temperatures maybe lower but the dew point temperatures will be higher. That combination means heat indices will be close to 100 degrees again on Thursday. A ""heat advisory"" remains in place for parts of Vermont as well. Heat index values are expected to hover between 100 and 104 degrees Thursday, so the advisory will not be lifted until Thursday evening. Meanwhile, the weather service projects that a ""heat advisory"" in place for the New York metro area will lifted by mid-day Thursday. High temperatures are forecast to be about ten degrees cooler than they were Wednesday, as southeasterly winds come in off the Atlantic Ocean. Show us ways that you are staying cool . Weather stations in Richmond, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Mount Holly, New Jersey; and at Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania and Newark International Airport in New Jersey all registered triple-digit temperatures early Wednesday afternoon. At Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland, temperatures also hit 100 degrees Wednesday afternoon, 4 degrees shy of Tuesday's high. But CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said heightened humidity Wednesday made it feel similar to Tuesday -- and he warned that the hottest time of day lay ahead later in the afternoon. Waterparks, pools and even fire hydrants became gathering places for people trying try to cool off as the record-breaking heat wave continued to roast much of the region. Officials are advising people to stay indoors as the prolonged heat and humidity creates a ""dangerous situation."" The heat already has claimed at least two lives. An elderly woman was found dead Monday night in a Philadelphia home without air conditioning, according to the city medical examiner's office. An adult was found dead inside a Baltimore home with a temperature higher than 90 degrees, the Maryland state health department said Wednesday. Young, fit people have succumbed to the extreme temperatures, too. Four midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, were being treated for signs of heat exhaustion Wednesday morning, according to academy spokeswoman Judy Campbell. The extreme heat caused scattered power outages in some states. There were customers without power in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Con Edison says customers who lost power in the New York City area should have electricity restored by early Thursday morning. Michael Clendenin of Con Edison told CNN's American Morning Wednesday that his company has been able to keep the power on for all but 6,000 or so of its 3.2 million customers in New York City. ""It is the kind of thing we expect in heat waves like this and we are working very hard to try to minimize the impact."" Clendenin said. He warned that the situation is far from over. ""So far, I would say we dodged major bullets. I think there's still a big shoot-out going on."" Clendenin said. Power isn't the only thing in sporadic supply in the heat-afflicted region. According to the general manager of the White Oak Ice company in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, ""The whole tri-state area is just about out of ice -- New Jersey, Philadelphia and Delaware. Absolutely unbelievable. It's terrible up here. We haven't experienced this in 12 years, 13 years,"" said John Sylvester. ""All the big major companies are out of ice. Guys are scrambling. They're calling for ice and it's coming from Wisconsin, Ohio, the Carolinas and they're running out. Demand is way higher than what everyone can produce and I don't see any end in sight,"" Sylvester added. ""Other ice companies are calling us begging for ice. There's only a certain amount of guys who manufacture and a company like ours, we're keeping up with it but we're coming to an end. We've used all our ice in storage. We start storing in February or March. We make a couple hundred tons a day."" In New York, the city set up as many as 400 cooling stations in its five boroughs, according to the Office of Emergency Management. Emergency Management Commissioner Joe Bruno urged people to use the center, and advised neighbors to check on neighbors to make sure they are well. Some of those neighbors might not have air conditioning to begin with. New Yorker Alfred Roblero not only lacks air conditioning in his apartment, he has to walk up six flights of stairs to get there. ""It's terrible. Most of the time my heart is like beating like... like I need air because of the heat,"" Roblero told CNN's Jason Carroll. ""This is a significant health emergency as well as a heat emergency,"" Bruno said. New York City officials say the unauthorized opening of fire hydrants often spikes during heat waves. Residents are being warned not to open hydrants without spray caps, because it's ""illegal, wasteful and dangerous,"" and could lead to fines and/or imprisonment. The city says illegally-opened hydrants could impede firefighting, waste more than 1,000 gallons of water per minute and knock down children, causing injury -- but adults can get legally-approved spray caps from their local firehouse that will limit water flow to 20-25 gallons per minute when placed on a hydrant. In Middletown, Connecticut, police issued summonses for second-degree reckless endangerment to two high school football coaches who held practice in the heat, leading one student to collapse. The assistant football coaches at Middletown High School staged a ""strength and conditioning session that consisted of weight training and running"" from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, the Middletown police said. A student passed out during a phase of the running that involved ""sprinting up a hill several times,"" police said. In Nashua, New Hampshire, Ben Dionne spent part of Tuesday outside cleaning out a pool. He told CNN affiliate WMUR he was following experts' advice to stay hydrated. ""It's hot. I'm just trying to stay cool and get as much water as I can."" In Philadelphia, a 92-year-old woman was found dead in her home. The woman, who was discovered by a neighbor, had opened a few windows but did not have air conditioning, said a medical examiner's spokesman. The National Weather Service is urging people to protect themselves. ""Be sure to check on your elderly relatives and neighbors. Coaches, trainers, camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke,"" the weather service warned. The heat can also adversely affect animals, and that's having an impact on a popular New York City tourist attraction. The city's health department bans carriage operators from working their horses ""whenever the air temperature is 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above,"" said department spokeswoman Suzanne Craig. She said anyone offering horse-drawn carriage rides at those dangerous temperatures is subject to fines from both the health department and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA. ASPCA officers in Central Park told Craig that operators complied with the mandate Tuesday, sidelining their businesses in the heat, except for early in the morning and late at night when temperatures dipped below 90 degrees, she said. Some people are fleeing the city for cooler places nearby. Mountain Creek Waterpark in Vernon, New Jersey, is drawing a lot of New Yorkers, park spokeswoman Alice Heinrich said Wednesday. ""It has been one of those weeks where everyone gets the idea, they see a heat wave and don't have pools, so they come out to the waterpark."" Heinrich said the waterpark is reminding visitors via its loudspeakers to drink fluids -- and making it easier for them to do so. Waterpark workers are going around handing out water to people waiting in long lines for rides, she said. CNN's Chad Myers, Mackenzie Green, Jessica Naziri, Jason Kessler, Mythili Rao, Cassie Spodak, and Ashley Vaughn contributed to this report.","Heat wave causes deaths in Baltimore and Philadelphia .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro replaced two high-level government ministers Monday -- citing errors and incompetence -- in the latest round of replacements at top-level government posts. Sugar Minister Luis Manuel Avila Gonzalez was fired after requesting his release because of admitted shortcomings in his own performance, according to an official statement published Tuesday in the country's state-run newspaper. Orlando Celso Garcia Ramirez will replace him, it said. Transportation Minister Jorge Luis Sierra Cruz was fired due to ""errors in the performance of duties,"" state media reported. He also lost his post as a vice president on a top governing body called the Council of Ministers, it said. Transport Director Maside Cesar Ignacio Arocha replaced Sierra at the Transport Ministry, while Gen. Antonio Enrique Lusson Batlle -- a long-time commander in the Cuban army -- assumed Sierra's post on the Council of Ministers. President Raul Castro, once the world's longest serving defense minister, assumed the presidency in 2006 when his older brother, Fidel Castro, stepped down because of illness -- at first temporarily, and then permanently in 2008. Since then, many analysts have speculated that the younger Castro has worked to consolidate power, replacing top government posts with army brass. ""The Cabinet is now substantially different to what it was in 2006, and substantially different to what it was in 2008,"" when Fidel Castro officially ceded power, said Julia Sweig, senior fellow at Council on Foreign Relations and recent author of ""Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know."" ""Of course this is Castro solidifying control,"" she said, ""but it's also an attempt to impose a culture of governance and efficiency"" in leadership positions that ""under Fidel were very uneven."" Sweig and others contend that recent changes in leadership may be part of broader economic measures intended to streamline Cuba's bloated state sector, which Raul Castro recently said has supported an excess of up to a million workers. Avila's release from Cuba's Sugar Ministry also has raised questions about its broader future. Once a world leader in sugar exportation, Cuba has faced a steady decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the accompanying subsidies that once boosted sugar production on the island nation. Widespread speculation suggests the country may eventually close its Sugar Ministry or even open it up to foreign investment in an effort to boost Cuba's cash-strapped economy. ""If that pans out, they may be bringing in someone [at the Sugar Ministry] who is more suited to that task,"" said Cuba analyst Phil Peters from the Lexington Institute in Washington. ""It may be aimed at foreign investment,"" he said, adding that ""Brazil and others could really help turn that sector into an energy producer."" Later Tuesday morning, Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero announced plans to open up real estate to foreign investment on tourism-related projects, laying out plans for new hotels across the country. The move comes only weeks after Cuba instituted a pilot program of turning over hundreds of state-run barber shops and beauty salons to employees. Since taking office, Castro has allowed such small liberalization measures and tackled corruption, fostering the creation of a comptroller general's office intended to better manage state revenues. Monday's replacements come on the heels of the removal of Rogelio Acevedo, long-time head of the country's airlines and airport. While no official explanation was given for Acevedo's release, it prompted widespread speculation of corruption. In an uncharacteristically critical article published on a state-sanctioned website last month, Cuban columnist Esteban Morales called corruption a greater threat to the island nation than internal dissent, specifically noting Acevedo's dismissal. ""Corruption is the real counterrevolution,"" Morales wrote, cautioning against groups entrenched in the country's Communist system.","Transportation Minister fired for ""errors in the performance of duties""

"(CNN) -- A Venezuelan journalist who has been held for two years without a trial reported that he has gone on a hunger strike, saying he wants the judge in his case to recuse himself. Leocenis Garcia made the announcement June 30 on Twitter. ""I am starting an indefinite hunger strike until the Judge Jesus Jimenez of Court 20 stops working on my case,"" Garcia said. It was not immediately known why Garcia wants the judge removed. The journalist was arrested in May 2008 and charged with five offenses, including illegal possession of a firearm, resistance to authority and property damage. Garcia and his supporters say he was really arrested for publishing articles critical of Venezuela's state-run petroleum industry. Garcia said in August 2008 that he had been tortured by Venezuela's secret police, published reports said. He is being held in the Tocuyito prison, and his father has expressed concerns that his son will be killed there. Human rights organizations have frequently accused leftist President Hugo Chavez of intimidating or punishing citizens based on their political beliefs. In June, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights sent a letter to Venezuela's foreign minister, criticizing the government on its record of freedom of expression. At issue were three cases, including the conviction and sentencing the previous week of journalist Francisco ""Pancho"" Perez to nearly four years in prison and a fine of more than $18,000 for defamation of public officials. The charges were brought because of a 2009 newspaper column published in the city of Carabobo that highlighted many of the mayor's family members who were hired as contractors by the local government. ""The evident disproportion of the sentence handed down for the publication of a piece that was clearly in the public interest demonstrates the serious state of vulnerability in which freedom of expression in Venezuela finds itself,"" the commission said in a statement. In February, the commission issued a 319-page report accusing Venezuela of routinely violating human rights. The report said that a lack of independence by Venezuela's judiciary and legislature in their dealings with Chavez often leads to the abuses. ""The report finds that not all individuals are ensured full enjoyment of their rights irrespective of their positions on government policies,"" the human rights panel said. ""The commission also finds that the punitive power of the state is being used to intimidate or punish people on account of their political opinions. The commission believes that conditions do not exist for human rights defenders and journalists to be able to freely carry out their work."" The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an independent arm of the Organization of American States. Chavez's opponents say his government represses political opponents and the expression of free ideas by jailing critics on trumped-up charges or pulling licenses for TV and radio stations and shutting down newspapers. There are about 40 such political prisoners in Venezuelan jails, the critics say. Most of those prisoners, Chavez critics say, are journalists and former military and police officials and others associated with a short-lived coup against Chavez in April 2002. Some of the prisoners have been held for long periods without trials or during proceedings that have dragged on for months and even years, the critics say, and they say other prisoners have received harsh sentences under questionable charges. Many of the detainees are held at the secret police headquarters rather than a prison. ""Attacks on journalists were widespread,"" said Amnesty International's 2009 Report on Human Rights in Venezuela. ""Human rights defenders continued to suffer harassment. Prison conditions provoked hunger strikes in facilities across the country."" Human Rights Watch, an independent global organization, issued a 230-page report in 2008 that said Chavez has shown an ""open disregard for the principle of separation of powers ... specifically, the notion that an independent judiciary is indispensable for protecting fundamental rights."" ""In the absence of credible judicial oversight,"" Human Rights Watch said, ""the Chavez government has engaged in often discriminatory policies that have undercut journalists' freedom of expression, workers' freedom of association and civil society's ability to promote human rights in Venezuela."" The Chavez government has routinely denied any allegations of human rights abuses, saying that authorities arrest citizens only on suspicion of breaking the law.","NEW: Human rights organizations say Chavez violates free speech .

"(CNN) -- A body was recovered in the vicinity of a boat accident in the Delaware River, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said Friday. Two passengers -- a 16-year-old girl and a 20-year-old man -- went missing in that area after a tour boat collided with a barge on the Delaware River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. The Coast Guard would not say definitively Friday that the body recovered was one of the two victims, waiting for the body to be positively identified by the Philadelphia Medical Examiner. Rescuers saved 35 people who were on the ""Duck"" boat at the time of the crash. The tour boat had a clean record, said the president of Ride the Ducks, who traveled to Philadelphia from the company's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia. ""I can tell you this boat has been inspected frequently. Twice daily. We've never had a problem with this boat,"" said Chris Herschend. The company voluntarily shut down its nationwide operations, including Stone Mountain Park, Georgia; Branson, Missouri; and San Francisco, California. ""What we hope to learn [is how] to prevent this from ever happening again,"" Herschend said. Officials said people reacted quickly after the collision. ""The immediate response was amazing,"" said U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Todd Gaitlin. ""The private citizens helped [rescuers] get people out of the water."" Police and Coast Guard vessels searched the river Thursday. Lt. Frank Vanore of the Philadelphia Police Department told reporters Wednesday that the boat had ""mechanical trouble"" and the engine shut down after a fire on board. While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said. The boat overturned and passengers were spilled into the river. National Transportation Safety Board officials will interview crew members on Friday, NTSB spokesman Robert Sumwalt said in Philadelphia Thursday afternoon. The investigation will include reviews from cameras along the river, training and navigation methods and safety equipment. ""We want to find out what happened and issue safety regulations so that this does not happen again,"" said Sumwalt, who is vice chairman of the NTSB. Alcohol tests on crew members came back negative, Sumwalt said. Drug tests will take longer to analyze. The 10 investigators will also look at allegations that similar boats have previously overheated or had mechanical problems. Herschend said the company is investigating and assisting fire and police officials. ""I believe this was an accident."" He said he could not speculate on whether there was a fire onboard or how the boat's captain communicated during the incident. But he said he believes the unidentified captain followed all procedures. He was unsure how long the boat was dead in the water before the collision. Asked by reporters Thursday whether the barge was at fault, Herschend said, ""I don't want to speculate. For me it is not to assign blame."" He said the 10-year-old craft had portable flotation devices. Herschend said the company is checking on whether the captain told people to jump off the boat moments before impact. ""It is my expectation for the captain that he followed our emergency procedures to the letter,"" he said. ""Our first priority is the people on board,"" Herschend said. ""Then we are going to work on making sure this never happens again."" The missing people are believed to be from outside the United States, he said. Searchers located the boat in about 50 feet of murky water, but it was too dangerous to send divers down, said William Blackburn, deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia police. The boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said. The ""Duck"" boats are amphibious military vehicles designed in the 1940s. The NTSB will also conduct a 72-hour history to determine the mental and emotional state of the crew of boat vessels, Sumwalt said. Eleven passengers were hospitalized. Nine were released by Thursday morning. One passenger suffered a broken jaw, Gaitlin said. The company, Ride the Ducks, is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment. The company's website posted this message Thursday: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with our Philadelphia tour guests, crew members and their families. We are attending to their needs first. In the interim, we have voluntarily suspended our Ride The Ducks operations nationwide. If you already have a reservation, you can receive a full refund or reschedule for a future date. We will resume operations shortly."" CNN's Sarah Hoye and Cassie Spodak contributed to this report.","NEW: A body was recovered Friday .

""I am thrilled to enter the global athletics arena once again and look forward to competing with all the disputes behind me,"" she said in a statement released by her legal team. Semenya emerged from obscurity at the beginning of last year to run world class times over 800 meters, culminating in victory over the distance in the world championships in Berlin in August. Her runaway gold medal performance in one minute 55.45 seconds raised eyebrows and the IAAF announced at the championships that they would be conducting tests to determine her gender. On return to South Africa, Semenya became a cause celebre among the public and was feted by leading politicians, who were angered by her treatment. But it later emerged that Athletics South Africa (ASA) had carried out a gender test on her even before she departed for Berlin. The ASA president at the time, Leonard Chuene, initially denied that such a test had taken place, but was forced to admit he lied and has been suspended along with the rest of the ASA board. Semenya's lawyer Greg Nott said that the decision to allow her to compete again had come after protracted negotiations between the IAAF and her own medical team. ""Our direct negotiations with the IAAF representatives, through the mediator, have been ongoing for 10 months,"" he said. ""Meetings have been held in Monaco, Istanbul and Paris, but due to the nature of the matter the parties resolved to keep the negotiations confidential,"" Nott added. Semenya now has the opportunity to compete in the world junior championships in Canada later this month, but October's Commonwealth Games in Delhi is a more realistic target.","Caster Semenya gets the all-clear to compete again as a woman .

"(CNN) -- Two-time NBA MVP LeBron James says the Cleveland Cavaliers -- his only club in his seven pro seasons -- will have an ""edge"" when they try to keep the likely free-agent-to-be from leaving this summer. In an interview scheduled to air on CNN Friday night, Larry King asked James whether the Cavaliers have an edge to retain the Ohio native. ""Absolutely,"" James said. ""Because ... this city, these fans, I mean, have given me a lot in these seven years. And, you know, for me, it's comfortable. ""So, I've got a lot of memories here. And so it does have an edge."" James' potential freedom -- he can opt out of the last year of his contract and become a free agent on July 1 -- is one of the most talked about issues in the world of sports this year. Sports Illustrated's website has a ""LeBron James Watch"" blog, ESPN.com has a ""LeBron Tracker"" page devoted to his next move, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer's site has a ""LeBron-O-Meter"" that swings with each stay-or-go rumor. Full transcript of Lebron James interview . Even President Obama has weighed in, telling TNT's Marv Albert last month that James would fit in with the club that Obama pulls for, the Chicago Bulls. And the New York Daily News reported last month that Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he thinks James would love living in New York, should he choose the Knicks or the Nets. James headlines a list of marquee names who also are free-agents-to-be or likely free agents this summer, including Miami's Dwyane Wade, Toronto's Chris Bosh, Phoenix's Amare Stoudamire, Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki and Atlanta's Joe Johnson. King asked James about reports that he, Wade, Bosh, Johnson and others were planning to talk to each other before they settled on where to go. ""I don't know to that extent, but it will be fun,"" James said. ""It will be fun to get all the free agents together and figure out a way how we can make the league better."" The Cavaliers drafted James, 25, out of high school in 2003. He grew up in the nearby Akron, Ohio, area. James, a six-time NBA all-star, was named the league's MVP for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons. He's averaged 27.8 points per game, and he has helped the Cavaliers to five playoff appearances and one trip to the NBA finals. But he's still seeking his first NBA title, and the Cavaliers were bounced from the second round of this year's playoffs by the Boston Celtics. He told King his goal is to be with a team that can win more than one NBA championship. ""I understand that me going down as one of the greats will not happen until I win a championship,"" he said. ""I'm going to do what's best for me and my family."" The interview is scheduled to be shown on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" at 9 p.m. ET Friday.","LeBron James: ""I've got a lot of memories here.

"(CNN) -- Family members of a missing Oregon boy said they are trying to keep the focus on finding the boy and not suspicions about the boy's stepmother. Kyron Horman, 7, vanished on June 4, and since then there has been intense scrutiny on Kyron's stepmother, Terri Horman. Police had asked her to take a second polygraph test in relation to the case, and other family members have said that she has not been forthcoming about what happened, based on briefings they have had from law enforcement officials. It is unclear why a second polygraph was requested. The boy's father, biological mother and stepfather spoke to the media late Monday about the stepmother and why they believe that Kyron is still alive. ""We remain hopeful because we haven't been given any information by law enforcement to indicate he isn't still alive and therefore we will always expect that he will come home to us,"" the family said in an e-mailed response to reporters covering the case. Kyron went missing after Terri Horman dropped him off at school on June 4. The stepmother said she last saw Kyron walking down a hallway toward his second-grade classroom at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, according to the police. Police have not called her a suspect in the case but suspicions about her have dominated headlines in recent weeks. Sources told the CNN affiliates that investigators believe that Terri Horman has lied to them, and cell phone records could show she wasn't where she claimed to be. In the e-mail response, Kyron's family members said they hope people will focus more on the missing boy. ""Our main goal is to keep Kyron in the front of everyone's mind because we have a better chance of finding him. So we are constantly working to keep him the focus of the story and not Terri,"" the family members said. Terri Horman was again in the headlines Monday when CNN affiliates KGW and KATU reported that she had attempted to hire a landscaper to kill her husband several months ago. KGW reported that sources believe Terri Horman approached the landscaper, who had been working on the family's property in northwest Portland, and offered the man ""a large sum of money"" to kill her husband, Kaine Horman. Kaine Horman and the other two family members who e-mailed reporters did not want to comment on that report. But they did say that they continue to feel that Terri Horman is not completely cooperating with police running the search for Kyron. ""We continue to issue our plea of her FULLY cooperating with law enforcement and the investigation to help bring Kyron home as quickly as possible,"" the family members said. However, at a news conference last week, Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Staton said that ""to date there has been no indication through our detectives or through our investigators that she's been uncooperative,"" KATU reported. Repeated efforts by CNN to reach Terri Horman have been unsuccessful. She has not made any other public statements. CNN's Gabriel Falcon and HLN's Natisha Lance contributed to this report.","Family members of missing boy talk to reporters .

"(CNN) -- A quarrel between occupants of two vehicles at a McDonald's restaurant drive-through in southern Finland erupted in gunfire Tuesday, leaving three men dead, police said. Three occupants in one of the vehicles have been arrested, said Peter Fagerholm, a detective inspector in the town of Porvoo. The two vehicles were in line at the restaurant about 2 a.m. when the quarrel began, Fagerholm said. Shots from a semiautomatic handgun were fired from a Toyota SUV into a convertible driven by a pregnant woman and carrying four men. Two of the men in the convertible, ages 28 and 45, died at the scene. Another 28-year-old man died Tuesday afternoon at a hospital in Finland's capital, Helsinki, about 50 miles to the west, Fagerholm said. Two of the men were shot in the head, the other in the chest, he said. The cause of the argument was not immediately known. ""We believe it was a very small issue"" that escalated, Fagerholm said late Tuesday. He said he doesn't believe the parties in the different cars knew each other, or that the shooting was preplanned. The SUV carried one woman and two men, Fagerholm said. One of the men, 41, is the principal suspect. In 1995 he was sentenced to life in prison on one count of murder and two counts of attempted homicide, Fagerholm said. He was released on parole in December. Fagerholm would not release the suspect's name. Authorities are speaking with witnesses in a third car in the drive-through line.

"(CNN) -- For a website devoted to exposing secrets, WikiLeaks.org is pretty good at keeping its own. Not much is confirmed about exactly who founded it and runs it, who donates money to allow the five or so full-time people and hundreds of volunteers to keep it going, and where it all happens. Despite such murkiness, WikiLeaks has gained international notoriety since it started posting classified documents and other secret information from a European base in January 2007. In April, video of a U.S. military helicopter strike in Iraq that killed two Reuters journalists raised questions about the attack, as well as how WikiLeaks got the military tapes. Now, rumors abound that WikiLeaks is poised to post more video of Americans at war, perhaps involving U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan that killed civilians and prompted a military report critical of what happened. The Pentagon has taken notice. In a secret 2008 report leaked to WikiLeaks, the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Center called the website a potential threat to U.S. forces and counterintelligence efforts. ""Recent unauthorized release of DoD (Department of Defense) sensitive and classified documents provide FISS (foreign intelligence and security services), foreign terrorist groups, insurgents and other foreign adversaries with potentially actionable information for targeting U.S. forces,"" said the report posted on WikiLeaks. To Julian Assange, the website's director and only public face, it's all about providing information necessary for citizens to make decisions that shape their future. ""All the information in a society, all the happenings in a society, is relevant to choosing to support"" a government, political parties and particular leaders, Assange said in an interview posted on WikiLeaks on June 1. More revealing was an April interview on the U.S. comedy show ""The Colbert Report,"" in which Assange acknowledged to host Stephen Colbert that the goal of posting secret documents was to gain the ""maximum possible political impact."" For example, Assange told Colbert, he titled the video on the Iraqi helicopter strike that killed the Reuters journalists ""Collateral Murder"" because, he said, that's what happened. At the same time, Assange said, WikiLeaks always provides to the public all the video or documents available so that viewers can decide for themselves. ""If people have a different opinion, the full material is there for them to analyze and assess,"" Assange told Colbert. WikiLeaks publishes anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials after vetting them, it says. It claims never to have fallen for a forgery. A scouring of Internet sources found some basic information about the website, including that it was started by a group of activists that included Chinese political dissidents and it survives on donations. Assange, an Australian journalist depicted in media reports as a former computer hacker, described WikiLeaks in a January interview as run by five or so full-time people supported by hundreds of volunteers. His work with WikiLeaks won Amnesty International's 2009 UK Media Award in the new media category for ""Kenya: The Cry of Blood -- Extra Judicial Killings and Disappearances,"" a suppressed report on police killings by Kenya's National Commission on Human Rights. In the January interview posted on the Medien-Okonomie-Blog, Assange described an almost covert operation with no headquarters that needs roughly $300,000 a year to function as a mostly volunteer organization. ""But there are people who can't afford to continue being involved full-time unless they are paid,"" he said, estimating the costs would approach $1 million year if that happened. He explained the value that WikiLeaks provides to the mainstream media by publishing otherwise unobtainable information. ""We take the most legally difficult part, which is not the story, but usually the backing documents,"" Assange said in the interview. ""As a result there is less chance of legal action against the publisher."" For its own legal troubles, Assange said, WikiLeaks relies on lawyers donated by mainstream media outlets including The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times. The website's biggest U.S. splash was the April posting of what it said was video from a U.S. helicopter involved in an attack in Baghdad that killed nine people -- including the two Reuters journalists -- and wounded two children. A U.S. Army intelligence analyst was arrested two months later, allegedly for leaking classified military information, the U.S. military said. The website Wired.com identified him as Spc. Bradley Manning, 22, and said he had leaked the video of the helicopter assault. Wired.com reported that Manning confessed to the leak in a series of online chats with a former computer hacker. He allegedly owned up to leaking other items to WikiLeaks, including the classified Army document assessing the threat level of the website, as well as State Department cables, according to the article . Public airing of the video forced the Pentagon to defend the actions of its troops in a report that concluded the Apache helicopter crews had no way of knowing the journalists -- Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh -- were among suspected insurgents on the street. Now Assange is described as living on the run, and the Iceland Parliament has passed a proposal intended to make the country a haven for whistle-blowers such as WikiLeaks. CNN's Richard Greene, Atika Shubert, Atia Abawi and Tom Cohen contributed to this report .","Rumors abound that WikiLeaks will soon post video footage of air strikes in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- A man who killed himself before police could question him about the abduction of a 4-year-old Missouri girl was a convicted sex offender, a local official told CNN Thursday. Paul Smith, 38, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Lincoln County, Missouri, coroner Robert Shramek said. Smith shot himself as investigators approached him late Wednesday afternoon. He died in a hospital at 10:29 p.m., Shramek said. Smith was a convicted sex offender, according to Missouri's sex offender registry and Louisiana, Missouri, city administrator Bob Jenne. St. Louis County Police Chief Timothy Fitch told reporters Thursday that ""good old-fashioned detective work"" led authorities to Smith. ""We have plenty of evidence that Paul Smith is the suspect,"" Fitch said in a news conference. The girl, Alisa Maier, was found alive Tuesday night in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton, about 70 miles south of her Mississippi River hometown of Louisiana, Missouri. She was wearing different clothes than the ones she had on when she was abducted, and Fitch said they were able to trace those clothes to a particular Wal-Mart. Store employees showed authorities transaction records from Smith's purchase of a pack of cigarettes, which in Missouri, requires the buyer to give their date of birth. ""All (investigators) had to work with was some video of this individual and his date of birth,"" Fitch said. Alisa was discovered at a gas station car wash, where witnesses saw her walking away from a car with a very loud muffler, which then left the station. Fitch said Smith was familiar with that area. The little girl's parents identified her from a photograph sent by police there, her grandfather, Roy Harrison, said Wednesday night. ""You couldn't miss the big brown eyes,"" Harrison told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" But the search went on for the man who abducted her, who was seen driving a dark-colored, four-door sedan with missing wheel covers and a loud muffler. A tip led police to a home in the town of Hawk Point, about 45 miles south of Louisiana, where police found a car parked outside a home that roughly matched that description, Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Al Nothum said. Before police could speak to the man at the home, ""He pulled out a gun and shot himself,"" Nothum said. Alisa was snatched from the front yard of her home Monday evening as she played with her 6-year-old brother. Harrison said his granddaughter is ""a bright young girl"" who has talked ""a little bit"" with her parents about her abduction. Anita McKlevis, a neighbor, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that the town of about 4,000 was overjoyed by the girl's safe return. ""It was like someone gave us all $1 million,"" McKlevis said. ""Everybody is so happy for this little girl and the family. We are going to stick by the family. That's important."" McKlevis said she sent cupcakes to the family's home, ""because I know she loves them."" And Harrison said the family was ""ecstatic"" over Alisa's safe return. ""I've told people earlier, if I could do a back flip, I would,"" he said. ""When we get her back and get the family together, we're gonna have a barbecue and togetherness, and hugs and kisses. I couldn't be any happier.""","NEW: Paul Smith, suspected of abducting a 4-year-old gir, was a convicted sex offender .

"(CNN) -- To his congregants, he lived the humble existence of a pastor. But a high-flying Connecticut priest was charged this week with first-degree larceny in the theft of almost $1.3 million from his church's coffers to fund a lavish double life that included swanky hotels and male escorts, said Capt. Chris Corbett of the Waterbury Police Department in Connecticut. Father Kevin Gray, 64, a former pastor at Sacred Heart Church in Waterbury, allegedly embezzled money from the church over the course of seven years. He used it to pay for fancy restaurants, clothing, vacations, hotels, a New York City apartment and a male companion's tuition at Harvard University, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate WTIC and filed with the Connecticut Superior Court. The affidavit says that between June 2003 and March 2010, Gray spent about $205,000 at high-end restaurants, $132,000 in hotel stays and $85,000 at clothing stores. While in New York City, he frequented the Waldorf Astoria, Omni Berkshire, and the W Hotel Times Square, among other posh hotels, the affidavit states. He also allegedly shopped at high-end retailers including Barneys, Armani and Saks Fifth Avenue. Along with expensive taste, Gray allegedly kept company with a number of male escorts, and allowed some to have credit cards in their name on his account. One escort, Islagar Labrada, allegedly charged more than $49,000 to the account. ""Some items Mr. Labrada charged included a stay at the Sheraton in Buena Vista, Florida, storage facilities, computers, computer software, cell phones, anti-aging creams, artwork, Louis Vuitton stores, a home alarm system and bicycles,"" the affidavit reads. ""Mr Labrada also charged $8,864.69 to Crunch Fitness Gym for membership fees."" Another man, Weirui Zhong, who told police he met Gray in Central Park in 2005, said Gray paid for his rented apartment in New York, a piano, dogs and Harvard University tuition since 2008, according to the affidavit. Zhong told authorities that when he pressed Gray about why he was always paying him with checks from Sacred Heart Church, Gray told him that he won big cases as an attorney, and that he put all his live savings into the church account. He also lied to Zhong and his parishioners that he was suffering from cancer, the affidavit says. ""Gray became very bitter with the church starting in 2001 when he was transferred to a parish in New Hartford while his mother was dying in New Haven,"" according to the affidavit. ""Mr. Gray stated that when he started in 2003, he began taking the money because he felt the Church owed it to him."" His official salary over those seven years totaled just over $184,000, or almost $27,000 a year. According to the affidavit, Gray scammed an additional $221,000 in 2005 by signing an agreement with Wireless Capital Partners, a communications company based in Los Angeles, California, to allow a wireless antenna to be placed in the church, though doing so was strictly prohibited. Gray's scheme came to light after a routine audit of the church's finances by the Archdiocese of Hartford found numerous accounting discrepancies. ""At the financial level, the Archdiocese continues to work with the parish to improve its financial controls and to address issues arising from the situation such as insurance coverage and outstanding indebtedness,"" the Archdiocese said in a statement. ""At the spiritual level, we continue to pray for healing and consolation for the parish family as it moves forward, and for guidance and reconciliation for Father Gray.""","Connecticut priest charged in stealing almost $1.3 million from church .

"New York (CNN)  -- TV's ""Top Chef"" is now the top chef in the U.S., and he wants you to eat at his restaurant -- no silver spoon required. Tom Colicchio won the Outstanding Chef Award at Monday night's James Beard Awards at Avery Fisher Hall in New York. While he's glad of the nod, he's well aware that many people think it means his restaurants are now out of their league. Colicchio is the owner of Craft, Craftsteak, the 'Wichcraft sandwich chain, and the recently opened Colicchio & Sons, and host of the ""Top Chef"" program on Bravo. See list of James Beard award winners . He and Beard's Best Service Award winner, Grant Achatz of Chicago's Alinea, agree that while fine dining may be pricey -- it's often roughly the cost of concert or sports tickets -- it's also a chance to have the experience of a lifetime. And it's their business to make diners feel welcome. ""Most of the better restaurants out there -- even if they're high-end -- are usually not snobby and pretentious. It's the restaurants that are trying to be like that that get it wrong! The root of dining and hospitality is taking care of people,"" Colicchio told CNN. ""People go to high-end restaurants and expect it to be snobby. They get their hackles up. They see a waiter talking to another waiter, sharing a joke, and think they're being laughed at. Come on. That's not the case."" ""In New York, [waiters are] writers, dancers and painters. They don't have money to go to fine-dining fancy restaurants! They're not from some highfalutin' background and going to look down at you. They're working-class people -- like everyone in restaurants."" And while you'll never leave his restaurants hungry, don't go expecting to have to loosen your belt too much. But do ""expect to be really taken care of. When food costs more, the restaurant can afford to have more staff on the floor."" ""Things you need to keep in mind going to an upscale restaurant are that the price you're paying is not for a lot of food. It's for high-quality food. It's a very different dining experience than if you're going to a chain restaurant where they're piling it on."" ""I was reading a book called 'The Zen Guitarist,' which essentially said that too much food on a plate is wasteful and unappetizing and it's the role of the chef to deliver the right portion of food."" Colicchio adds, ""Do a tiny bit of research. Go online and see what they have to offer. If you're intimidated by the menu, that's when you really need to use the waiter."" His most important bit of advice for diners: ""Be nice. It goes a long way. You don't need to palm a maitre d' with a tip at the door to get a good table. If you walk up and say, 'This is a special occasion -- my wife and I are having our first anniversary,' they'll take care of you."" At Chicago's Alinea -- which was ranked in 7th place on a recently released list of the world's top 50 restaurants -- diners will never have to wonder if they're using the right salad fork -- or any fork at all. Chef Grant Achatz is known for serving highly inventive dishes involving elements like scented air, temperature contrasts and custom-made utensils that sometimes require eating instructions from the wait staff, and he's well aware that many diners are outside of their comfort zone. ""Because of the nature of the cuisine -- it being challenging because of the manipulations of ingredients and the way it's presented -- we have to counteract that with very approachable service,"" he told CNN. ""Unlike a lot of four-star restaurants in the past that [have] scripts for describing the dishes and everyone has to cut their hair the same -- all the connotations of the snooty French waiter -- we intentionally abandoned. We encourage our staff to let their personality shine through, because that's real hospitality. It's about making people feel comfortable and welcome."" Achatz is aware that he's likely to encounter skeptics with his unusual approach to dining, but he and his staff are up to the challenge. ""Some people walk through the door, ready to let us take them on a journey. With some people, it takes a course or two to build up that trust -- through the food or the service team letting them know it's OK to laugh out loud. It's OK to giggle and smile,"" he said. And diners do. Blogs and websites abound with stories of patrons weeping, moaning and screaming with surprise and delight most nights of the week. His advice to diners: Come with an open mind. And he'll do his part to help. Said Achatz, ""When we opened nearly five years ago, there was so much hype and buzz and people saying they were worried they weren't going to 'get it.' We decided to combat that."" ""The very first bite that everyone had was, literally, peanut butter and jelly. We're going to give you something everyone had at some point in their life. It doesn't look anything like a peanut butter and jelly, but it will taste like one. That's going to set the tone, and people are going to laugh, and everything is OK after that. In a way we were making fun of ourselves."" And if the chef and staff can have a ball, so can the customers. Said Achatz, ""Relax. You're here to have a good time.""","James Beard ""Outstanding Chef"" Tom Colicchio: Fine restaurants aren't snobbish .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday the United States must take the lead on energy, citing the ""enormous job creation potential that exists."" President Obama holds talks with members of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board on Wednesday. Obama's remarks came at the end of his first quarterly meeting with the Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which was created in February to provide the administration with independent, nonpartisan advice on how to promote economic growth and stability. The focus of Wednesday's meeting, which was streamed live on the White House Web site, was job creation and green energy. Obama told the board members he's seen ""some return to normalcy"" in parts of the financial markets.  Watch Obama describe the 'progress' he sees » . ""But obviously, one of the things I've been concerned about since I took office is looking beyond the immediate crisis in front of us to find out what is a sustainable economic model, post bubble and bust,"" he said. ""How do we create sound fundamentals on issues like education, on health care and ... energy, as well as all the innovation that's required around these various areas, so that moving forward, we don't find ourselves in an unsustainable economic model?"" he asked. Paul Volcker, who chairs the board, said as the panel discusses investments, they can't forget the risks of inaction. ""There isn't enough emphasis, it seems to me, on the cost of what happens if we don't do anything,"" said Volcker, who served as the chairman of the Federal Reserve during the Carter and Reagan administrations. Obama said the steps taken around energy this week have been ""promising."" The president on Tuesday announced new fuel economy rules, including a requirement for passenger cars and light trucks to get an overall average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. Obama and the board spent about an hour discussing the immediate opportunities and challenges for green energy. Panel members expressed concerned that the United States is behind other countries in controlling carbon emissions. ""We think it's very important to act now,"" said John Doerr, a partner with Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers. ""If we act now, and send very clear signals to our business community and the nation."" Doerr said he thinks ""putting a price on carbon"" is the most important thing they can do, but he said it's not the only policy that can be adopted. He also stressed the importance of research and development funding. Obama has been pushing Congress to move ahead with legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution. Board member Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman and CEO of GE, called clean energy ""the most exciting, fastest growth industry of the 21st century."" He said his company's 70 energy-efficiency products are generating $18 billion in revenue and accounting for 50,000 jobs between GE and its suppliers. ""Technology is out there to be had. I think we have to have a broad aspiration to lead in technology,"" Immelt said. Richard Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, said he sees clean energy as a ""tremendous potential for us to lead"" and an opportunity for solid, middle-class jobs. Trumka expressed concern, however, that the tax code and various trade agreements the administration was looking at could put them at a disadvantage in the global market. But overall, he said, he sees green energy as a ""win, win, win"" for the country. The advisory board has been established for a two-year term, after which Obama will determine whether it is still needed. It is modeled on the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, created during the Eisenhower administration to provide the president independent advice on global affairs. Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist, serves as the board's staff director and chief economist. He also served as an economic adviser for Obama's presidential campaign. The other board members are: . • William H. Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission . • Roger W. Ferguson Jr., president & CEO of TIAA-CREF . • Robert Wolf, chairman and CEO of UBS Group Americas . • David F. Swensen, CIO of Yale University . • Mark T.

Because women spend so much time and money on their hair, Rock says men are forced to adopt a hands-off policy. ""You cannot touch a black woman's hair. You are conditioned not to even go there,"" he says. ""When I was a dating guy, I dated women from different races. Anytime I was with an Asian or a Puerto Rican girl or a white girl, my hands would constantly be in their hair. Like my hands were thirsty."" One of the first lessons Rock learned on this journey was that women do their hair for one another. ""They say it's for the men, but it's really for the women. Because guys don't care,"" he says. ""There's no point in the history of the world where men were not sleeping with the women in front of them. We take what we can get."" Actress Nia Long, who Rock interviews in the film, agrees. ""There's always this sort of pressure within the black community like, if you have good hair, you're prettier or better than the brown-skinned girl that wears the Afro or the dreads or the natural hairstyle,"" she says. Oprah.com: Oprah's stylist reveals his hair secrets . Rock found the biggest moneymaker in the hair business to be weaves. Black women can spend six to eight hours getting their hair braided into tiny sections. Stylists then delicately attach tracks of hair -- which can be simple extensions or full wigs -- to the braids. ""If you've got a weave, your scalp's like a beat up highway,"" Rock jokes. Women who wear weaves stop by the salon for regular washes, conditioning and tightening, but the real expense lies with the hair itself. Rock says he was shocked to learn that regular women spend thousands of dollars on weaves -- and even put them on layaway. ""Janet Jackson spends $5,000 to go to the Grammys on her hair. I didn't know Kiki was spending $5,000 to go to AT&T and answer the phone,"" he says. ""That was disturbing."" Rock discovered the hottest hair on the market is found in India, where human hair is the number two export behind software. ""This is some of the worst poverty in the world,"" he says. ""I don't think [people] know they're walking around with $1,000 on their head."" While in India, Rock witnessed a tonsuring ceremony at the Venkateswara Temple. Every year, more than 10 million people cut their hair off as an offering to the Hindu gods. ""In India, hair is considered a vanity, and removing hair is considered an act of self-sacrifice,"" he says. ""These people have no idea where their hair is going or how much it's worth. The money made at this temple is second only to the Vatican. The hair collected here is auctioned off to exporters who distribute it around the planet."" Another staple of the industry is relaxers -- also called ""creamy crack"" by some. While women of other races use perms to add curl, black women use them to straighten their hair. ""You name a black woman, any black woman,"" Rock says. ""They've either had their hair relaxed, or they're having their hair relaxed right now."" The active ingredient in relaxer is a substance called sodium hydroxide. The chemical is so strong it can burn a woman's hair off -- which is why Rock is urging parents to stop the relaxing addiction now. ""This kiddie perm has to stop, okay? They shouldn't have to worry about that till they're in their teens,"" he says. ""Putting those chemicals in that child's hair is just not cool."" Rock says he tells his own daughters they're beautiful every moment he can --and has only one answer when it comes to questions of having good hair. ""Whatever makes you happy is good hair,"" he says. ""Do your hair for you, and you will be happy."" Oprah.com: Find the right look for you -- risk free! From The Oprah Winfrey Show "" © 2009 .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama has tapped a former Army general to lead the Transportation Security Administration, sources have told CNN. Obama plans to nominate Robert A. Harding, a retired major general with 33 years in the Army, to become the TSA administrator, sources said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will announce the nomination Monday with Harding by her side, according to one administration official. ""The TSA administrator is the most important unfilled post in the Obama administration,"" one administration official said. ""Mr. Harding has the experience and perspective to make a real difference in carrying out the mission of the agency."" ""If there was ever a nominee that warranted expedited, but detailed, consideration in the Senate, this is it,"" the official said. In September, Obama nominated Erroll Southers, a Los Angeles airport police department official, to head the agency. But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, spearheaded GOP efforts to block the nomination based on concerns Southers would unionize airport screeners. Southers withdrew his nomination in January after lawmakers questioned his changing explanation about a personnel action taken against him decades ago. Harding would be the TSA's first African-American administrator. Southers also is black. Harding has served as CEO of Harding Security Associates, a defense and intelligence government contractor that he founded in 2003 and sold in July 2009. From 1996 to 2000, Harding was director for operations at the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he was the Defense Department's senior human intelligence officer. Before that, he was director for intelligence for the Army's Southern Command. The TSA was created in the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and soon took over security at the nation's airports, including screening commercial airline passengers and luggage. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Nomination of Robert A. Harding to be announced Monday, sources say .

"(CNN) -- A man convicted in the execution-style killings of three students in New Jersey nearly three years ago was sentenced Thursday to three consecutive life sentences, the Essex County prosecutor's office said. Rodolfo Godinez was the first person to stand trial in connection with the Newark murders. He got a 20-year sentence in addition to the life sentences. Under New Jersey laws, Godinez would become eligible for parole after serving 216 years in prison, the prosecutor's office said. One side of the courtroom was filled with victims' relatives and 10 gave statements asking New Jersey Superior Court Judge Michael Ravin to hand down the maximum sentence. The lone-survivor of the attack, Natasha Aeriel, spoke last, according to Romesh Sukhdeo, assistant county prosecutor. ""She spoke today, and clearly at this point she was angry ... she said some harsh words toward the defendant but that's to be expected since her brother and two best friends were killed,"" Sukhdeo said. A jury convicted Godinez, 26, on all 17 counts including murder, felony murder, attempted murder and robbery after just four hours of deliberations, according to Sukhdeo. Godinez was charged along with five other defendants currently awaiting trial in the August 4, 2007, murders of Terrance Aeriel, Dashon Harvey, and Iofemi Hightower behind the Mt. Vernon Elementary School. They were made to kneel against a wall before they were shot execution-style in the head. Aeriel's sister, Natasha, was also shot in the head, but survived the attack and later testified as the prosecution's main witness, according to Sukhdeo. All of the victims were either students or about to be enrolled at Delaware State University. During the 22-day trial, the prosecution argued that Godinez was involved in gang recruiting and characterized him as the ringleader of the group of defendants who used a handgun and a machete to attack four friends who had gathered to socialize behind a school. ""These kids weren't into drugs, they were minding their own business and these guys came up to them, robbed them, sexually assaulted one woman and then executed them,"" Sukhdeo said. Godinez maintains his innocence, but admitted to be a member of the MS-13 gang and present at the school on the night of the triple homicides. However, he said he didn't participate in the crimes, according to his attorney Roy Greenman, who said he is planning to file an appeal. Ballistic evidence, information from Aerial and a fingerprint lifted from a beer bottle at the scene led to the major break in the case that outraged the city. By the time the attacks took place, the city had already recorded 60 killings that year. The city's reaction to the murders helped Newark's police department implement policing tactics and technologies, including wireless camera surveillance and audio gunshot detection systems. ""Community organizations got together and through local foundations were able to raise money ... and that has enhanced our ability to create public safety in this city in a big way,"" said Garry McCarthy, Newark police director.","Rodolfo Godinez eligible for parole after 216 years .

"(CNN) -- Japan's governing body of sumo wrestling announced it has fired star sumo wrestler ozeki Kotomitsuki in the wake of a gambling scandal that has enveloped the sport, according to news reports. The unprecedented move also was taken against Kotomitsuki's stable master, Otake. Kotomitsuki becomes the first active ""ozeki,"" the champion rank to which he was promoted in 2007, to be fired, Kyodo News reported. He was found to have gambled on professional baseball, with money allegedly a source of funding for mobsters. The Japan Sumo Association on Sunday stopped short, however, of expelling them, the most severe sentence which would bar them from receiving retirement allowances, according to Kyodo News. Such a sentence would be decided by a council of high-ranking sumo officials, Kyodo News reported. The Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, which runs later this month, will go on as planned. The allegations have shaken sumo wrestling, with 63 percent of people responding to a poll saying the summer tournament should be postponed, according to the national Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The scandal also has led to the arrest of a former sumo wrestler and the demotion of a stablemaster-coach of several wrestlers who also allegedly gambled on baseball. The association has sought to repair the damage. The association's chairman says on the association website that the situation is ""unprecedented and critical."" He also promises to try to ""regain the fan's confidence ... as soon as possible."" Sumo is an ancient sport dating back some 1500 years, according to the Japan Sumo Association's website.","Kotomitsuki was found to have gambled on professional baseball .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration's rush to sweep the recent Russian spy scandal off the table as quickly as possible with this swap is a bad move on several counts. It is understandable and correct that President Barack Obama values the overall U.S.-Russian relationship above the question of whether a few Russian spies spend years in jail. The ""reset"" campaign was an excellent idea; too bad no one in our Department of State knew how to correctly spell the word in Russian when Secretary Hillary Clinton presented the ""button"" to the Russian Foreign Minister. However, there is a line between seeking a mutually beneficial relationship and delusional pandering. The history of U.S.-Russian relations shows that dealing respectfully but firmly is what works best. Most importantly, Moscow only agrees to anything that it perceives to be at least 50 percent in its self-interest, not because we've been nice guys. The only thing releasing all of these deep-cover Russian intelligence officers within a matter of days is going to teach Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, an old KGB officer, is that Obama is a pushover -- overly focused on making sure not to offend Russia. Aside from sending the wrong political message, the quick swap also tells the leadership of the Russian government and the SVR, its intelligence service, that there is really no downside to being caught carrying out espionage in America. Any intelligence service in the world, including Russia's, when deciding whether to carry out a particular espionage operation looks at the ""risk factor."" What will be the blow back if this becomes known? Running ""illegals"" -- that is, Russians posing as citizens from a third country and who have no overt connection to the Russian embassy or consulates in America -- would usually be considered a high-risk operation by Moscow because those Russian citizens don't have diplomatic immunity if caught. It's bad press and it's bad for morale within the SVR if one, much less 11, of your deep cover officers get caught and are facing decades in prison. But Obama has now just told the SVR, ""Hey, there is no penalty for spying in America. If we catch you, we'll just let you go so as not to damage 'big picture' relations."" We did show Russia certain appropriate courtesies in these arrests, which would have indicated we didn't want to harm our political relationship with Russia. We waited until Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had made his visit to America. We waited until after the G20 meetings in Canada. We haven't even publicly named or expelled the Russian diplomats who were apparently observed being involved in the communications with these illegals. (Hopefully, the Department of State has at least told the Russian ambassador that certain of his diplomats should quietly leave America.) And speaking of morale, what message does this send to the hundreds of FBI special agents who spent thousands of hours working these cases? According to various press accounts, the number of Russian intelligence officers in America and Western Europe has already returned to Cold War levels. Obama has now told the Russians, there isn't even a problem if we catch you. Try anything you want. Normally, when any intelligence service has a major flap as this was, it would order an immediate stand down of other operations in that country for perhaps several months while it tried to figure out what had gone wrong. By immediately sending these SVR officers back to Moscow, they will be available to assist in that investigation. Not knowing what all they were involved in -- it was certainly more than ""penetrating the local PTA"" -- I don't necessarily advocate having kept these people in prison for decades, but a year or two in prison before offering a swap would have sent a strong message to Putin and the SVR. And if the press accounts are accurate, getting four people out of Russian jails in return for these 10 doesn't seem like much of a bargain either. (An 11th suspect detained in Cyprus  remains on the loose after being released on bail.) Obama is no doubt an intelligent fellow, but he certainly didn't get very good advice from his intelligence community or Russian experts about how to handle this spy caper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Coyle.","Ex-CIA Russian expert says the quick spy swap will be seen as sign of U.S. weakness .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- A Sri Lankan Cabinet minister on a ""fast unto death"" to protest a U.N. human rights panel announced Friday that he had resigned his post as his supporters marched in Colombo carrying placards condemning the world body. Crowds carrying portraits of former minister Wimal Weerawansa marched to the Russian Embassy to seek Moscow's help in stopping the United Nations from probing alleged war crimes. They handed a memorandum to that effect to an embassy official. Police said the about 200 people carried placards condemning the U.N. move and shouting slogans against Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Organizers said a similar request will be made to the Chinese Embassy. Meanwhile, several nations expressed dismay at the blockade of the U.N. compound and Weerawansa's leading role. ""Peaceful protest is part of any democracy, but blocking access to the United Nations -- of which Sri Lanka itself is a member -- as well as intimidating and harassing U.N. personnel is a breach of international norms and harmful to Sri Lanka's reputation in the world,"" said a statement from the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Romania, Norway and the European Union. ""We call upon the government of Sri Lanka to take all appropriate steps to ensure the safety and security of U.N. personnel and premises,"" it said. Weerawansa continued his fast for a second day, rejecting warnings from a doctor to drink water or risk affecting his kidneys. He said he would go without food until Ban dissolves a three-member panel that is looking into human rights abuses in the final stages of a decades-long war that ended in 2009 between the government and the Tamil Tiger rebels. The United Nations has been concerned about accountability issues related to the rebels' defeat, including alleged war crimes by troops and rebels -- allegations that both parties deny. ""Ban's move is intended to bring President Mahinda Rajapaksa before a war crimes tribunal. We will not allow that to happen,"" Weerawansa told a news conference earlier in the week. Weerawansa's Cabinet colleagues visited him at a special tent outside the U.N. compound in Colombo. He lay on a mattress on a specially-constructed dais protected by plain-clothed security. Visits by ministers signalled government backing for Weerawansa's protest against the United Nations. Meanwhile, the United Nations office continued to function with limited staff. External affairs minister, G.L. Peiris, defended the protest in Parliament. He said it ""is in conformity with the law"" and added that the government has no right to suppress peaceful demonstrations who are entitled to democratic rights.","Ex-minister protests a U.N. panel that addresses human rights violations .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's foreign office yanked Friday a blog posted by its ambassador to Lebanon that mourned the death of an ""admired"" Shiite cleric once considered Hezbollah's spiritual leader. Frances Guy wrote that she left the presence of Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who died Sunday, feeling a better person. ""Lebanon is a lesser place the day after, but his absence will be felt well beyond Lebanon's shores,"" she said. ""The world needs more men like him, willing to reach out across faiths."" The comments about Fadlallah, once closely associated with Hezbollah, ruffled diplomatic feathers. Israel, especially, was not happy. In a statement Friday, Britain's foreign office said the ambassador ""expressed a personal view"" on Fadlallah and did not reflect an official government position. The blog, it said, was taken down. ""While we welcomed his progressive views on women's rights and interfaith dialogue, we also had profound disagreements -- especially over his statements advocating attacks on Israel,"" the statement said. Guy, who has been British ambassador to Lebanon since 2006, explained her views in a new blog posted Friday. ""The problem with diplomatic blogging is that you risk being anodyne or controversial,"" she wrote. "" Clearly in the last few days I have been the latter. This was not my intent. My comments on the late Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah have now been removed because they were leading to confusion about British policy. ""I would like to be clear. I have no truck with terrorism wherever it is committed in whoever's name. The British government has been clear that it condemns terrorist activity carried out by Hezbollah. I share that view."" The U.S. State Department classifies the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization. So does Britain. When the group formed in the early 1980s, Fadlallah was considered its spiritual leader. But he always insisted he had nothing to do with its operations. In later years, Sheikh Fadlallah mellowed in some of his views, and spoke out in favor of interfaith dialogue. But his views on Israel did not soften. In a letter penned to President Obama last year, Fadlallah said: . ""The size of support and cover-up provided by your country for the Zionist entity has become known. This entity was established on the land whose people were uprooted by the power of iron and fire. The subsequent American policies have contributed to the loss of the Palestinian cause, despite the ratification of many Security Council resolutions."" Fadlallah died Sunday and thousands of mourners filled the streets of Beirut, Lebanon, to pay tribute. Guy said Friday that she understood her words had offended people. ""The blog was my personal attempt to offer some reflections of a figure who, while controversial, was also highly influential in Lebanon's history and who offered spiritual guidance to many Muslims in need,"" she wrote. ""I recognize that some of my words have upset people. This was certainly not my intention. I am sorry that an attempt to acknowledge the spiritual significance to many of Sheikh Fadlallah and the views that he held in the latter part of his life, has served only to further entrench divisions in this complex part of the world."" Earlier this week, CNN's senior Middle East editor, Octavia Nasr, left the network after a controversial posting on Twitter about Fadlallah. ""Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah. One of Hezbollah's giants I respect a lot,"" Nasr tweeted last Sunday. Nasr, who is Lebanese, later addressed the issue in a blog posted on CNN.com: . ""Reaction to my tweet was immediate, overwhelming and a provides a good lesson on why 140 characters should not be used to comment on controversial or sensitive issues, especially those dealing with the Middle East."" ""It was an error of judgment for me to write such a simplistic comment,"" she wrote. Nasr's Twitter post ""created a wide reaction,"" said Parisa Khosravi, senior vice president of international news gathering for CNN Worldwide. ""We believe that her credibility in her position as senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs has been compromised going forward,"" she said, and as a result CNN had ""decided she will be leaving the company.""","Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, once considered Hezbollah's spiritual leader, died Sunday .

"(CNN) -- LeBron James is a grown man who made a grownup decision to take his massive basketball-playing ability from Cleveland to Miami in a desire to get the one thing every true baller desires: the opportunity to call yourself a champion. Forget all the nonsense about him ""owing"" his hometown and how his legacy could have been cemented had he stayed in the Midwest and continued to try to win a title in Cleveland. LeBron had the absolute right to pick up his things and go where he thought it was best to win, and he did it. Enough with all of this ridiculous chatter that he's a selfish, spoiled basketball prodigy. LeBron was an employee of the Cleveland Cavaliers. He had no ownership stake and no control. Everyone talks about what his presence meant to the Cleveland economy. Did he own any of those businesses? No. But he made them, and the Cavaliers, richer by his play. There is undoubtedly a tradeoff, because being a star athlete is a two-way street. You become richer by virtue of folks coming to see you play, and the league, team, marketers and surrounding businesses get to piggyback off of your success. LeBron gave them a solid seven seasons, and everyone enjoyed the ride. Say thank you for the LeBron gravy train, and now, like any smart business owner, you need to figure out your next revenue stream. Now, let's deal with the fans. I read with fascination about how LeBron ""owed"" the fans. Really? What exactly did he owe them? We need to stop with this belief that fans in a city ""own"" a particular player. We get to sit back and enjoy the skills of these modern-day gladiators in our gleaming new Colosseums, while they bust their butts, play injured and have to take all of the criticism when things go bad. As fans, we justify it all by saying, ""Well, he's getting millions to play, so he should shut up."" We need to grow up and realize that once his playing days are over, we will say, ""Thanks, LeBron, now move over so we can worship the next stud."" In fact, when a particular athlete has overstayed their welcome, the fans are the loudest in telling him to leave the court. To me, there is a huge difference between a player like LeBron James and Albert Haynesworth of the Washington Redskins. Albert has pocketed nearly $40 million and has refused to show up at training sessions with Washington because he doesn't like the defensive scheme. That is dumb. LeBron showed up and did his part, and when his contract was up, he exercised his free will to do as he pleased and shop his talents. He did what every single American wants: to go to a new job where the desires you always wanted can be fulfilled. So how is that wrong? No one -- athlete, stockbroker, Wal-Mart greeter, grocery store clerk, secretary, journalist -- wants to be treated like they are a piece of property. We all desire the freedom that comes with making our own choice as to where we want to work and achieve the goals in life that we all set. I can identify with that. In 1993, I decided to leave the Austin American-Statesman, where I was the county government reporter. The then-city editor sat across from me and said, ""I felt like it was a punch in the gut when told you were leaving."" He had an indignant, paternalistic tone that I found offensive. See, I was making $24,000. When the Houston Chronicle pursued me for a job a few months earlier that would be around $27,000, I was told I was talking myself out of a job in Austin. So when the Fort Worth Star-Telegram offered me a gig at $32,000, I didn't even bother seeing whether Austin wanted to counter. The new job allowed me to go to a bigger market and have the upward mobility I desired, so I took the job. So I told the city editor, ""Look, you didn't take some kid off the street, teach him how to talk, write and dress. You paid me for a service, and I delivered. Now I'm choosing to take my skills elsewhere."" I then got up and left the meeting. It was offensive to me that my bosses at the paper felt like I was being an ungrateful employee. I wanted to do more with my talents, and I refused to allow someone to make me feel bad about my decision. It's my life, my career, my choice. So how is that bad? Now I get folks who didn't like LeBron having a one-hour special to announce his decision. But we are all used to the hype in sports. Do we really need a six-hour pregame show for the Super Bowl? Can't we play the NBA All-Star Game without all of the side attractions? Would boxing be boxing without the wild and crazy news conferences? Hype and sports go hand-in-hand. That's why I found the letter written by Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert so pathetic. Here is a man who was enriched by the play of LeBron James; according to Forbes, the value of the franchise increased by $100 million with his on-court performance. Yet instead of being a gracious owner and simply reaffirming his commitment to the fans to put a winning team on the court, Gilbert ripped LeBron to shreds, calling him ""narcissistic"" and his decision to leave a ""cowardly betrayal"" and ""a shameful display of selfishness."" Gilbert even went on to trash all athletes by saying, ""It's time for people to hold these athletes accountable for their actions. Is this the way you raise your children?"" In an interview, Gilbert later said LeBron quit on the team in the playoffs the past two years. Really? So if he was all of that, Dan, why did you want to re-sign him? Who wants a quitter on his team? If LeBron had chosen to stay in Cleveland, rich boy Dan would have been all smiles, slapping his back, getting ready to count the money he could make off of the back of LeBron. So who would have been the real selfish, narcissistic individual, Dan? Gilbert now says it's time to speak out against LeBron, yet as long as James made him richer, he would have kept quiet. Sorry, Dan, you've pimped LeBron long enough. LeBron showed Dan Gilbert that only LeBron owes LeBron an explanation. No owner, CEO or boss has the right to demand that someone stay as an employee. The employee has a right to live their life as they see fit. As the CEO of LeBron James Inc., he did what's in the best of interest of him. And as the most important shareholder, isn't that what he's supposed to do? I'm sorry, folks, but the loyalty that used to exist from teams and companies is gone. Some still believe in it, but for many of us, we're simply a dot on the spreadsheet. Business is cutthroat, and we have to accept that reality. So, King James, go to Miami and do your thing. Grow your corporation to be as big as you want it to be. And never look back at the haters who are mad you chose not to act like a highly paid indentured servant or 21st-century slave, held in place by the invisible shackles dressed up as loyalty to a city, owing the fans and satisfying someone who is clearly an ungrateful owner. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin says LeBron James is a grown man who made a grownup decision .

"(Mother Nature Network) -- If you've been keeping tabs on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, you've probably been wondering how exactly you can help. Well, for those of you with furry, four-legged flatmates, it can be as easy as sweeping the floors and collecting all that errant fur and hair. So how exactly can hoarding pet fur help with cleaning up one of the worst environmental disasters in recent memory? Enter Matter of Trust, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that's been accepting donations of non-filthy pet fur and human hair since 1998 to craft oil-absorbing hairmats -- described as ""flat square dreadlocks"" -- and hair-stuffed containment booms made from recycled pantyhose. These hairy contraptions are effective at soaking-up oil and they don't require any new resources ... just stuff you'd normally trash (or compost) unless you're into, umm, stockpiling fur. I must say, sending along fur to Matter of Trust via Excess Access  is an eco-ideal spring cleaning mission for folks with critters around the house. In addition to pet owners, groomers and salon owners can get involved too by sending in bulk shipments of hair/fur. In fact, as of Tuesday, 400,000 pounds of hair was en route to the Gulf Coast. Mother Nature Network: How to treat cats with allergies. Alabama hairdresser Phil McCrory came up with the hairy idea while watching news reports on the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, according to the Matter of Trust website. As a hair professional, he knows how hair is attracted to oil-- and why humans need to shampoo their hair regularly. The oil clings to the hair but is not absorbed by it. That makes hair a good, natural cleaning aide. Matter of Trust says they've opened more than a dozen warehouses in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida where the hair is shipped. Hundreds of volunteers stuff the hair and fur into nylons which are then tied together to form tubes or booms. The booms are used to surround, contain and  aid cleanup of the oil spill. What is needed, how to send it: . • Clean hair from human heads -- can be straight, curly, dyed, permed, straightened   • Every type of fur, horse hair, wool waste and feather is fine   • Make certain there is no garbage -- metal or paper -- in with the hair/fur   • Washed nylon stocking (even with runs)  • Place in separate plastic garbage bag, put inside of separate boxes labeled debris-free hair/fur or nylons  • Check with Matter of Trust website to find out where to ship the boxes. © Copyright 2010 Mother Nature Network .","Your hair and pet's fur is needed to help clean Gulf oil spill .

"(CNN) -- University of Tennessee head football coach Derek Dooley dismissed one player and suspended two others Friday following a bar fight that sent an off-duty Knoxville police officer who tried to intervene to the hospital. Dooley booted Darren Myles of Atlanta, who is accused of assaulting a University of Tennessee officer who rushed to the scene where the Knoxville officer was knocked unconscious. Dooley also indefinitely suspended Marlon Walls, a defensive tackle from Olive Branch, Mississippi, and linebacker Greg King of Memphis, Tennessee. Their role in the incident was not known late Friday. ""It is a privilege, not a right, to be a member of the University of Tennessee football team,"" Dooley said in a statement. ""The most important responsibility of that privilege is to properly represent this institution and our supporters on and off the field. ""I am disappointed and in many ways embarrassed by the poor judgment displayed on many fronts by several members of our football team last night,"" Dooley said. Several people, including other UT football players, were being questioned by police and at least one -- Darick Rogers, a highly sought-after high school football recruit from Calhoun, Georgia -- has been charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, police spokesman Darrell DeBusk said. The fight broke out at Bar Knoxville -- a popular destination for University of Tennessee athletes -- shortly before 2 a.m. Friday, DeBusk said. Robert Capouellez, a Knoxville police officer, was lying on the ground unconscious when emergency officials arrived on the scene, DeBusk said. Capouellez is reported in stable condition, officials said. Gary Russell, who was assaulted by several people inside the bar and also was transported to University Medical Center with multiple injuries, has been discharged, a hospital official told CNN. The bar's co-owner, Sandy Morton, told CNN affiliate WBIR some 10 football players ""just started randomly beating up a customer."" ""It was total chaos,"" Morton said. Witnesses told police the fight started inside, but bar employees pushed those involved outside onto the sidewalk. That's when Capouellez intervened. According to witnesses, the officer was hit in the head and kicked several times while lying unconscious on the ground. A total of six individuals -- who DeBusk said appear to be associated with the University's football program -- have been identified as potential suspects. They were located and detained for questioning, he said, and police want to question three or four others who may have been involved in the fight. Officer Brian Greenlee of UT Police rushed to the scene and ordered the group to stop. According to an affidavit, Greenlee made contact with Myles, a defensive back. Myles fled, was ordered to stop and struck Greenlee's left eye with his elbow when the officer tried to place a restraint hold on him, according to the police report. Myles ran off and was later found hiding in bushes, police said. Myles was arrested and faces simple assault, resisting a stop and fleeing/evading arrest charges, the UT Police report said. Greenlee did not require medical treatment, said Amy Blakely, assistant director of Media and Internal Relations. The case was brought by UT Police because its officer was assaulted, she said. Myles was released later Friday on a $1,000 bond and Rogers was released on a $1,000 bond, according to CNN affiliate WATE. ""We always give VIP status to the football players,"" said Morton. ""It won't be happening anymore."" ""Although we are still gathering all the facts and some legal proceedings will follow, we have taken some initial levels of discipline resulting from my conversations with the student-athletes who were present,"" Dooley said in the statement. Dooley also answered questions at an evening press conference, including one about Myles' dismissal. ""It hurts our team,"" said Dooley, according to CNN affiliate WBIR.  ""A lot of people get hurt when you do things that aren't right.  It's not just Darren who's hurt.  I had to sit there and watch his mother cry, who's hurt.  And his family is hurt, I know his father is hurt.  And I know his home town is probably disappointed.""

"FUMICINO, Italy (CNN) -- Under a canopy of elegant Italian pines, the foundations of a mini Roman Coliseum are at once unmistakable and exhilarating. The intricate statue head archeologists unearthed while excavating the site at Fumicino, Italy in early 2009 . The structure at ""Portus,"" the Romans' ancient Mediterranean port, has remained undiscovered for eighteen centuries until now. University of Southampton archaeologists have just this summer uncovered the remains of an amphitheater, a Roman warehouse and the ruins of an Imperial palace even though archaeologists have been digging at this site since the 19th Century. ""It's true I think also to say that we have kind of rediscovered it because the great Italian archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani reported the discovery of a theater in the 1860s but nobody could actually find it,"" says Professor Simon Keay, a leading expert on Roman Archaeology at the University of Southampton.  Watch a report on the site's discovery » . ""There is only one imperial Rome, and Rome only had one imperial port and Portus is that port. In a sense it is trying to give an idea not only of the importance by virtue of that but also because the archaeological potential of it is huge,"" adds Keay. The site is a feast for the eyes in the true Roman sense. Excavations have unearthed priceless treasures apart from the foundations of the amphitheater.  See images of the site » . An exquisite white marble head of a statue was found close to the site of the amphitheater. Experts believe it could be a bust of Ulysses or possibly a Greek sailor. Rare and finely carved fragments of columns have also been found. ""When we first started the project, everything you would have seen here was grass, a couple of trees,"" explains Keay. ""We very nearly fell into a hole because we couldn't actually see what we were doing. Clearly we have completely exposed this area and because these buildings are so big it is only by uncovering large areas of them that we can actually understand their function and their development,"" says Keay. The site is ironically less than a mile from Rome's modern transport hub, Fumicino International Airport, and this discovery owes more than a nod to modern technology. Using modern sensors, ground-penetrating radar and probes, researchers complied computer images of what lay beneath. They were dazzled by what modern technology revealed about the ancient past. ""So we then played around with it on the computer screen, we did a virtual reconstruction of it and amphitheater shape grew out of the screen and we knew that we were on to something very special,"" says Keay. The excavations in Fumicino, Italy, just outside Rome, continue in a joint project named ""Portus"" with the University of Southampton, the British School at Rome, The Italian Archaeological Superintendency for Ostia and the University of Cambridge.","Archeologists are excavating site in Fumicino, Italy, just outside Rome .

"(CNN) -- Parole officers saw and spoke to Jaycee Dugard during visits to the home of the man accused of holding her captive for 18 years, but they never questioned why she was there, California officials disclose in newly released documents. At least three different parole officers spotted Dugard at the home of Phillip Garrido, a convicted rapist who had been under California state supervision since 1999, according to a June memo from the California attorney general's office. On at least one occasion, a parole officer spoke to her and one of her daughters, whom investigators say Garrido fathered during her captivity. But those officers ""failed to investigate their identities or their relationship to Garrido,"" the memo states. The document outlines the $20 million settlement between Dugard and California authorities, which the state Legislature approved last week. It was drafted to brief state lawmakers on the settlement before their vote, said Christine Gasparac, an attorney general's office spokeswoman. Gasparac would not provide additional details of the reported contact between Dugard and parole officers. Dugard disappeared in 1991, at age 11, and was found in August 2009 at Garrido's home in Antioch, about 45 miles east of San Francisco. Garrido and his wife, Nancy, have pleaded not guilty to 29 felony counts in the case. Garrido was released on parole in 1988 after serving less than 12 years of a 50-to-life sentence for rape in federal and Nevada prisons. His victim in that case, Katie Callaway Hall, told CNN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that the latest revelation was ""unbelievable."" ""It's just one more astonishing fact in a long line of errors,"" said Hall, who is now an advocate for rape victims. She said the news ""re-triggers my anger"" because she had gone to federal authorities -- who initially handled his parole -- to warn that he had approached her after his release, and ""I don't think they believed me."" Responsibilty for Garrido's parole was transferred to California authorities in 1999. A November 2009 investigation found parole officers failed to follow utility wires running from Garrido's house toward the shed where Dugard was held, didn't check out the presence of a 12-year-old girl during a visit or act on information that indicated Garrido had violated the terms of his release. The June 25 memo concluded that while the state could have successfully defended some of the claims on procedural grounds, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ""recognizes that this case has a unique and tragic character."" ""Obviously, no amount of money could compensate these plaintiffs for what they have endured,"" it reads. But the settlement will provide Dugard and her daughters -- now teenagers -- with ""the financial support that they will need to rebuild their lives."" The document estimates the family will need as much as $7 million alone for decades of counseling. ""First, it is a virtual certainty that Ms. Dugard and her daughters will require counseling for the remainder of their lives, with varying degrees of intensity at different time periods,"" it states. ""Second, neither of Ms. Dugard's daughters has received any education, and neither is presently equipped to handle the academic or social challenges that school will pose. Ms. Dugard has received no education since her abduction, and all three have expressed their desire to obtain an education.""","NEW: ""It's just one more astonishing fact in a long line of errors""

"(CNN) -- NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a rural Georgia nightspot early Friday, police said. Police talked to Roethlisberger, 28, and the 20-year-old woman at the scene immediately after the incident was reported at about 2:30 a.m. Friday morning at Capital City in Milledgeville, Georgia, said Deputy Police Chief Richard Malone. However, Malone said investigators still need to do a follow-up interview with Roethlisberger and witnesses. He added that nobody has been charged in the alleged incident and stopped short of calling the football player a suspect. The woman ""alleged that he is the perpetrator,"" Malone told reporters. He said the woman was part of a group mingling with Roethlisberger's friends at the restaurant and that the groups had gone to other bars and restaurants over the course of the evening. He said the woman was treated and released from a local hospital Friday morning. Roethlisberger's agent, Ryan Tollner, said his client would cooperate in the investigation. Roethlisberger has been the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers for six seasons, guiding the team to two Super Bowl championships. ""Last night, Ben and his friends met a group of women and everyone mingled together throughout the evening,"" Tollner said in a written statement Friday. ""We have spoken to law enforcement. Based on information currently available, an allegation was made against Ben, which appeared to be dismissed after a preliminary investigation last night. ""Obviously, given the prior accusation against Ben, we are skeptical of motive, but we will continue to cooperate with everyone involved."" Tollner was referring to a civil complaint filed against Roethlisberger last year, also alleging sexual assault. Roethlisberger has denied the allegations by an executive casino host at Harrah's Lake Tahoe, saying, ""I would never, ever force myself on a woman."" Roethlisberger and eight Harrah's employees are named in the suit, which seeks at least $390,000, plus unspecified punitive damages, from the defendants.","Accuser was with group of women that had been hanging out with Roethlisberger .

"(CNN) -- Companies involved in the sinking of the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon made ""some very major mistakes,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Thursday after meeting with executives from the oil company BP. Salazar would not elaborate, telling reporters in Houston, Texas, that the cause remains under investigation. But he said the failure of the rig's blowout preventer -- a critical piece of equipment designed to shut off the flow of oil in an emergency -- was ""a huge malfunction"" that has left oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. ""The investigation will lead to conclusions about what exactly happened, but it didn't work the way it was supposed to work,"" Salazar said. ""And from my own preliminary observations, there were some very major mistakes that were made by the companies that were involved. But today is not really the day to deal with those issues."" The Coast Guard and the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service are leading the investigation into the loss of the drill rig, owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd. The slick has been spreading across the northern Gulf of Mexico since late April, when the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River. Eleven missing workers who were aboard the rig are presumed dead. BP owns the damaged well at the heart of the slick. Efforts to shut down the well have failed, leaving it spewing about 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico. There was no immediate response to Salazar's comments from BP, which has blamed Transocean. Salazar's meeting with BP executives -- his second trip to Houston in less than a week -- comes as oil washed ashore on Louisiana's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the Mississippi River. Workers also prepared to lower a massive containment vessel over the Gulf of Mexico's two-week-old undersea gusher. Have you been affected by the oil spill? Share your story, images . A pinkish-orange foam mixture of seawater and crude oil streaked across large stretches of water in the northern Gulf and turned up in the on the shores of the Chandeleur Islands, off southeastern Louisiana. Trace amounts of sheen had been reported on the shores of southeastern Louisiana over the past week, but the landfall reported Thursday appeared to the ""first impacts"" of oil from the spill, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters. Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP, said mild weather gave cleanup crews more time to attack the spill. More controlled burns were conducted Thursday, after BP and the Coast Guard used fire to destroy several thousand barrels of oil on the surface Wednesday, he said. But the spill was spreading westward and is projected to drift toward coastal parishes past the Mississippi River delta, spurring Louisiana to begin shifting preventive efforts to its southwestern coast, Gov. Bobby Jindal told reporters Thursday. ""That obviously opens up many more vulnerable areas along our coast,"" Jindal said. ""We're going to do everything we can to keep this oil out."" The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration already has closed the area to fishing, restricting a multibillion-dollar industry in the region. Suttles said BP held a meeting with parish governments and state officials, who offered ideas for beating back the oily tide and leveled criticisms. ""What's clear is this is their home,"" he said. ""And what's also clear is they're passionate about protecting their home."" Under federal law, BP is responsible for capping the well and paying for the cleanup. The company shipped a four-story-high containment vessel to the site overnight and expected to lower it toward the seabed nearly a mile below the surface late Thursday, Suttles said. The hope is that the container will collect the leaking oil, which would be sucked up to a drill ship on the surface. If the operation is successful, BP plans to deploy a second, smaller dome to deal with a second leak in the ruptured pipe. But getting the large structure into position could take several days, and the technique has never been attempted at the depth of these leaks. ""If all goes according to plan by early next week we hope to make it operational,"" Suttles said. ""As we always do, though, we stress this has never been done before. We'll likely encounter numerous challenges, but we'll remain committed to make it work."" BP has stopped the flow of oil from one of the three existing leak points from the sunken rig, but it was the smallest of the three leaks and did not affect the amount of crude pouring into the ocean. CNN's David Mattingly contributed to this report.","Firms involved in rig's sinking made ""very major mistakes,"" Ken Salazar says .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A ship billed as the world's largest skimming vessel has begun testing its effectiveness in the Gulf of Mexico, a spokesman for its owner, Taiwanese company TMT Shipping, said Saturday. The A Whale has been assigned a 5-mile-by-5-mile area to test its capability, spokesman Bob Grantham said, citing Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft. Testing is expected to continue Saturday and Sunday, with initial results probably available Monday, Grantham said. The skimmer works by ""taking in oily water through a series of vents, or jaws, on the side of the ship and then decanting the intake,"" Grantham said. ""In many ways, the ship collects water like an actual whale and pumps internally like a human heart."" The testing area is just north of the underwater oil gusher, the statement said. The A Whale arrived in the Gulf on Wednesday and has been awaiting approval to join in cleanup efforts. The vessel is estimated to be able to skim 21 million gallons of oil a day, at least 250 times the amount that modified fishing vessels currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain, according to TMT. Built this year, the vessel was meant to carry crude oil and iron ore. But after hearing about the oil disaster in the Gulf, TMT modified it to become the world's first large-scale skimmer, spokesman Frank Maisano said this week. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels (1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf daily since April 20, when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana. Also Saturday, response workers recovered boom suspected to have been vandalized in the marshes of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, the Deepwater Horizon Joint Information Center said. It released several Coast Guard photographs of the boom, which appeared to have been cut open. ""Boom vandalism and mishaps involving small craft moving or cutting boom with propellers impedes oil recovery efforts, endangers workers who must return to recover and replace the boom and slows efforts to conduct booming operations elsewhere,"" a statement from the center said. In an effort to reduce boom damage, the Coast Guard has instituted a safety zone around boom sites and established a hotline to report damage. Meanwhile, Environmental Protection Agency scientists were set to meet with the agency's chief Saturday to discuss the chemicals BP is using to break up the oil slick. Agency Administrator Lisa P. Jackson's briefing on dispersants in Gulf Breeze, Florida, comes two days after the agency released results from its first round of toxicity testing on eight of the dispersants used in the Gulf. The EPA study showed that the chemicals, when not mixed with oil, did not significantly disrupt the endocrine systems of marine life. But the agency has said it plans to conduct more tests of the toxicity of the dispersant when mixed with crude. Dispersants have been a key part of BP's cleanup strategy. Since the beginning of the disaster, more than 1.6 million gallons of the dispersant Corexit 9500 alone have been injected into the Gulf. Critics say the chemicals could harm marine life. But the Coast Guard has said that dispersant use is ""evaluated daily"" and that it's using the ""safest and most effective methods available"" to protect the sea environment. A CNN analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command showed that the chemical dispersants keep flowing into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the EPA's May 26 order to BP to ""significantly"" scale back. Before that date, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of Corexit. Since then, CNN's analysis showed, the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day, a 9 percent decline. Over the past few days, bad weather has significantly hampered BP's oil cleanup and collection efforts. Hurricane Alex made landfall in northeastern Mexico late Wednesday, but its impact was still felt in the Gulf days later. On Friday, more oil than what would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool slipped by the cap on BP's ruptured undersea well because of the bad weather, Zukunft said. The cap on the well in the Gulf of Mexico, bouncing in the rough conditions, captured 20,000 fewer barrels (840,000 gallons) of oil than anticipated, Zukunft said. The rough seas also prevented skimming or burning for the past two days, displaced boom and made it unsafe to fly, he said. BP spokesman Mark Proegler noted that forecasters expect rough seas to calm a bit this weekend. Crews are standing by to resume skimming operations and survey inland waterways that may have been affected because of a storm surge. Shoreline cleanup operations continue with limited weather interruption. For the 12-hour period from midnight until noon Friday, approximately 8,665 barrels of oil were collected and about 4,155 barrels of oil and 28.6 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared, BP said. Thursday's total oil recovered was approximately 25,150 barrels. Newly retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen announced Friday that since June, the skimming capability in the Gulf has increased more than fivefold, from approximately 100 large skimmers to 550 skimming vessels of various sizes working to collect oil in all parts of the region as. To date, 28.2 million gallons of an oil-water mix have been skimmed from the Gulf's surface. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","A Whale assigned 5-mile-by-5-mile area for testing .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In that strange intersection of economics and politics, there is a new fashion: Trillion is the new billion. One trillion $1 bills stacked one on top of the other would reach nearly 68,000 miles into the sky. A billion is a thousand million, and a trillion is a thousand billion. To provide some perspective on just how big a trillion dollars is, think about it like this: A trillion dollars is the number 1 followed by 12 zeroes. Or you can think of it this way: One trillion $1 bills stacked one on top of the other would reach nearly 68,000 miles (about 109,400 kilometers) into the sky, or about a third of the way from the Earth to the moon. Some Republicans are hardly over the moon about the growing size of the proposed economic stimulus plan. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said this week that Americans have become desensitized to just how much money that is. ""To put a trillion dollars in context, if you spend a million dollars every day since Jesus was born, you still wouldn't have spent a trillion,"" McConnell said. CNN checked McConnell's numbers with noted Temple University math professor and author John Allen Paulos. ""A million dollars a day for 2,000 years is only three-quarters of a trillion dollars. It's a big number no matter how you slice it,"" Paulos said. Here's another way to look at it. ""A million seconds is about 11½ days. A billion seconds is about 32 years, and a trillion seconds is 32,000 years,"" Paulos said. ""People tend to lump them together, perhaps because they rhyme, but if you think of it in terms of a jail sentence, do you want to go to jail for 11½ days or 32 years or maybe 32,000 years? So, they're vastly different, and people generally don't really have a real visceral grasp of the differences among them."" Everyone is tossing around the words million, billion and trillion. With the national debt now topping $10 trillion, following a $700 billion bank rescue and proposed $800 billion-plus stimulus package, have we become numb to the numbers?  How much is a trillion? » . "" 'Number' itself can be parsed 'number' or 'numb-er.' And maybe in this case, the latter is a better pronunciation,"" Paulos said. ""I think to some extent, we have ... evolved in a context where such big numbers were completely foreign."" Perhaps a better way to get a ""grasp of the numbers,"" Paulos said, is to use them to describe the budgets of government programs. ""The [Environmental Protection Agency's], for example, annual budget is about $7.5 billion. So, a trillion dollars would fund the EPA in present dollars for 130 years -- more than a century. Or the National Science Foundation or National Cancer Institute have budgets of $5 [billion] or $6 billion. You could fund those for almost 200 years,"" he said. Times have certainly changed. Back in 1993, President Bill Clinton wanted a $30 billion jobs and investment package. He didn't get it. Just last year, President George W. Bush signed an emergency economic stimulus of $168 billion --- a tally that seems paltry compared with the amount requested today. The economic problem, many say, demands huge spending. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has called it ""the mother of all crises."" The numbers are big, but so is the United States economy. The gross domestic product, which measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country, is about $14 trillion. Still, many wonder if we can afford it.   ""So we do have a big economy that may not be as vibrant as it was, but it is still a powerful economic engine. Knock on wood, we'll see what happens,""  said Paulos.  Last week, the House passed an $819 billion emergency stimulus, and the Senate version is approaching $900 billion. In the end, whatever lawmakers hash out probably won't reach $1 trillion. But consider this: If all of the financial market interventions, loans, guarantees, bailouts and rescues are approved, they will total more than $7 trillion.","One billion is equal to 1,000 million; One trillion is equal to 1,000 billion .

"Washington (CNN) -- Recently, I was talking with an interviewer about men and war (I wrote a book about this), and she asked me, ""What is it about testosterone that gets us into war?"" There is no doubt that women can fight. They do so every day in Afghanistan and Iraq. Though not permitted in the infantry in the U.S.,  they have seen plenty of action on a battlefield with no fronts. They are brave. They are also prudent. Some men, maybe not so much. In his correspondence between 1886 and 1898, for example, Theodore Roosevelt wrote enthusiastically about the prospect of war with Mexico, Canada, Britain, Germany and Spain. Roosevelt may have been an extreme example -- charging up Cuba's San Juan Hill, he exulted, ""Holy Godfrey, what fun!"" -- but he was hardly unusual in his eagerness for combat. When war against Spain was declared in April 1898, President William McKinley asked for 125,000 volunteers. He got over a million young American men almost overnight. In those days, women were not permitted in the armed services. But what if they had been? Do women share the yearning for combat that has defined so many young men in so many societies, all through time? I am tempted to say that women would be less likely to get us into wars. But then I remember Queen Elizabeth I (if you can't, just picture Cate Blanchett in body armor), British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (saying to President George H.W. Bush before the Persian Gulf War, ""Now, George, don't go wobbly on me"") and Golda Meir, prime minister of Israel during the Yom Kippur War (ordering revenge for the 1972 Olympics slaying of Israeli athletes). Does anyone doubt that gun-toting Sarah Palin would be ready to fight anyone, anytime? Hillary Clinton? Still, I think women do not have the same primitive urge to test themselves in combat. Back in Teddy Roosevelt's time, upper-class men in particular were determined to prove their manhood, fearful that they might be somehow exposed as weak and effeminate. This was particularly evident in Roosevelt's correspondence. He scoffs at his political foes as ""hermaphrodites"": roughly, half-woman, half-man. Curiously, however, Roosevelt was introduced to the mythology and glories of war by a woman. Josephine Shaw Lowell was the widow and sister of two great Civil War heroes and martyrs, Charles Russell Lowell and Robert Gould Shaw. (You may remember Shaw's fatal charge with his doomed black regiment from the movie ""Glory""). The young Josephine, a family friend of the Roosevelts', would visit wearing her widow's weeds and thrill little Theodore with the exploits of her martyred menfolk. In her old age, Josephine Lowell turned against war. She had the wisdom to see that a war to free the slaves in America was noble but that foreign adventuring in Cuba and the Philippines had more to do with the atavistic urges of men than wise policy or moral duty. Indeed, women may respond to the test of their essential identity in a less macho fashion then men. Although there were reportedly some problems with having women in the frontline units of the early Israeli army, women fought courageously and well in the Russian army against Germany in World War II. In the American military, women have taken on dangerous jobs. After some initial resistance, women fliers have been accepted by the brotherhood of naval aviators and air force pilots. In the movie ""Courage Under Fire,"" about a brave helicopter pilot in Desert Storm played by Meg Ryan, the men are shocked when Ryan cries. There is a wonderful scene in which Ryan tells the men to stop staring. ""It's just tears. It doesn't mean anything,"" she snaps. Women are no less courageous than male soldiers, but they sometimes have less need to show off. They certainly can bring a certain sense of humor that is useful in deflating male egos. After Teddy Roosevelt rode up San Juan Hill with his Rough Riders, his wife, Edith, went to Cuba to tour the battlefield. When she returned, she slyly told her husband that the hill of his famous charge was not quite as high as she had been led to believe. It is not known whether Roosevelt laughed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Evan Thomas.","Evan Thomas was asked, ""what is it about testosterone that gets us into war?""
He says women brave, prudent; historically, men, like Teddy Roosevelt, eager for combat .
Women can make war (Thatcher, Meir) but lack men's macho urge to test themselves .
Thomas: Women tend to have have less need to show off ."
"Washington (CNN) -- An unlikely sponsor at this year's annual conservative conference is hoping to not only promote the issues that set it apart from many Republicans, but also draw attention to the beliefs they share. The group is called GOProud -- a name that combines GOP and gay pride. So far, the group is getting a mixed response at the Conservative Political Action Conference. GOProud was founded by former members of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization. GOProud has a booth at CPAC just two spaces away from the exhibition for the National Organization for Marriage, which wants the government to define marriage as between a man and a woman. The organizations obviously see social issues differently. ""It's the ultimate Washington power grab to say let's have a federal constitutional amendment that will federalize the question of marriage,"" said GOProud chairman Christopher Barron. Through speaking at the event, exhibiting a booth and co-sponsoring the conference, GOProud hopes to highlight the views it has in common with other Republicans -- limited government and fiscal responsibility. But the members' nontraditional conservative views are rankling some attendees at CPAC. Liberty University Law School, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, boycotted the event after GOProud was announced as a co-sponsor. The younger activists, however, are more accepting. About 10,000 people are expect to attend CPAC, and a conference spokesman said at least 60 percent, and maybe as high as 80 percent, of the attendees are expected to be younger than 30. ""People in the under 40 age range have become a lot more accepting of homosexuality,"" attendee Deborah Corey said. ""But I think there's also more of an attitude among Americans that's sort of more libertarian that says people have the right to do what they want to in their own lives and to take the consequences for it, as well."" Chris Plante, who is running the booth for the National Organization for Marriage, said being two booths away from GOProud wasn't an issue. As cameras rolled, he introduced himself to Barron. ""I hope we'll have more time to talk over the next four days. Maybe we can have a beer later,"" Plante said. ""We can have a beer summit later. It worked for Obama,"" Barron joked. A meeting, yes.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba's Roman Catholic church has identified 12 more jailed dissidents who are expected to be freed in what would be the largest Cuban prisoner release in more than a decade. The announcement Saturday raises the number of prisoners to be released in the next few days to 17, roughly one-third of the total amount the government plans to release by mid-November. The move follows a visit by Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, who met with Cuban President Raul Castro and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega on Wednesday. Cuba's church earlier announced the names of five other prisoners to be freed, and identified six others to be transferred to prisons closer to their homes. The 52 political prisoners Cuba plans to release are the remainder of a larger group of 75 dissidents who were jailed during a government crackdown on political opposition in March 2003. They represent roughly one-third of all known political prisoners left on the island, according to Cuba's unofficial Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation. The prisoners will head to Spain upon their release, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Juan Lugo told CNN. Wednesday's announcement also brought an end to a 134-day hunger strike by Cuban opposition activist Guillermo Farinas. Farinas stopped eating solid foods in February following the death of jailed hunger striker and political dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who was protesting what he described as poor conditions in detention. Zapata's death sparked international condemnation from Europe and Washington and drew a rare statement of regret from President Castro.","The 12 dissidents would be part of largest prisoner release in a decade .

"(CNN) -- An American serving an eight-year sentence in North Korea recently attempted suicide, North Korea's official news agency said Friday. The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that Aijalon Mahli Gomes attempted to take his own life ""driven by his strong guilty conscience, disappointment and despair at the U.S. government that has not taken any measure for his freedom."" The news agency said the Swedish Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in North Korea, had ""acquainted itself with the condition of the patient at the hospital."" The Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it does not comment on individual cases and refused to confirm or deny its involvement. Gomes was arrested after crossing the North Korea-China border on January 25. In April, he was sentenced to eight years of hard labor for what state media described as ""a hostile act committed against the Korean nation."" The American was, according to South Korean press reports, an English language teacher with strong Christian convictions, who had taken part in anti-North Korean protests in the South. Last month, KCNA reported that North Korea may consider a tougher punishment for Gomes if the United States ""persists in its hostile approach"" toward Pyongyang. Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had crossed the border last March and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Robert Park, a Korean-American Christian evangelist who was arrested after entering the country on Christmas Day, had given a media interview in which he stated his aim to force change in North Korean human rights conditions. He was released in February after telling North Korean state media that he had been wrong about human rights conditions there. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","North Korea sentenced man to 8 years of hard labor .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio calls himself ""America's toughest sheriff."" He is famous for creating a tent city jail in the Arizona desert; for providing pink underwear for inmates; for bragging that he spends more to feed his dog than a prisoner in his jail. This year he has made national headlines for his tough enforcement of Arizona's anti-illegal immigration laws and for his vocal support for a controversial new immigration law that takes effect at the end of July. But the 77-year-old lawman is himself the subject of serious allegations of abuse of power. Arpaio's critics say he has a long history of launching bogus criminal investigations against political opponents and anyone else who gets in his way. This year a federal grand jury started looking into the allegations. Former Maricopa County School Superintendent Sandra Dowling says what happened to her is a case in point. Dowling says was locked in a political battle with some members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors over school district funds when the sheriff's SWAT team came in the dead of night to search her home. Dowling was charged with stealing money from a school for homeless students. There were 25 felony counts in all. ""Never could I have imagined what a nightmare was waiting ahead,"" Dowling said. Arpaio promised to uncover massive public corruption -- ""We are looking into all avenues of this investigation,"" he said -- and to win a speedy conviction. From the start Dowling maintained her innocence: ""I kept saying I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything."" It took three years, but finally a judge threw out all the felony counts against Dowling. She entered a guilty plea to a single misdemeanor charge. But she said her reputation had been shattered, her career destroyed, and she owed more than $100,000 in legal fees. ""I still don't think that everybody knows I was innocent,"" she said. Dowling is not alone. Arpaio has launched -- either on his own or in conjunction with the county attorney -- high-profile criminal investigations against a who's who of Maricopa County politicians and officials. The list includes the mayor of Phoenix, a former police chief, two members of the board of supervisors, Superior Court judges, and even a former state attorney general. The charges have included public corruption, misuse of taxpayers' dollars, bribery, rape and even child molestation. What all these investigations hold in common is that they were launched with great public fanfare, but rarely resulted in convictions. Among the investigations recounted in this report, the only conviction has been on the misdemeanor charge against Dowling. Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon calls the sheriff's long list of investigations a ""reign of terror."" Gordon came under Arpaio's scrutiny, he says, after speaking out against the sheriff's neighborhood sweeps to round up illegal immigrants. The mayor says he received a torrent of records requests from sheriff's investigators, and he was later told that he was under investigation on possible child molestation charges. Gordon says the sheriff ""bragged that he was watching my office from his office with a telescope."" The sheriff's department confirmed that Gordon was investigated on child molestation accusations. In the end charges were never filed. ""He is a coward,"" said former Buckeye, Arizona, Police Chief Dan Saban. In 2004 Saban challenged Arpaio's bid for a fourth term in the sheriff's office. That was when the local news reported that Arpaio was investigating his rival on charges of rape. It was a claim made by Sabin's foster mother. She claimed the rape occurred 30 years earlier, when Saban was only 15 years old. Saban says he was the victim, not the foster mother. Once again charges were never filed. But Saban noted the sheriff alerted the media to the details of the sordid accusation. ""They put out a media campaign against me,"" he said. ""That I was the subject of a criminal probe."" It sounds familiar to County Supervisor Don Stapley. ""They indicted me on 118 counts."" he said, ""none of which I'm guilty of."" Those 118 counts of public corruption against Stapley made big headlines before they were thrown out of court by a judge. Arpaio has refilled many of those charges and Stapley is still fighting to clear his name. Arpaio turned down CNN requests for an interview, citing the federal grand jury investigation and a series of threatened lawsuits from these and other cases. However, one of Arpaio's long-time assistants was eager to defend his boss. Deputy Chief John MacIntyre says that in each and every case, the sheriff's investigations were fully justified. ""Was there probable cause? There was a ton of probable cause,"" he said. In the rape investigation of the sheriff's political rival, Saban, for example, MacIntyre says it was a case the sheriff had to investigate. ""We didn't make up the mother's testimony,"" he said. ""It came in here like a bombshell."" MacIntyre says it was just coincidence that the sheriff benefited when the story was leaked to the press. Andrew Thomas is another Arpaio ally. He is the former Maricopa County attorney who participated in a number of Arpaio's high-profile cases. He is currently running for the Arizona attorney general's office. He, too, defends Arpaio's investigations, saying, ""The reality is these were legitimate cases that needed to be brought."" ""It wasn't just brought up out of thin air, there was evidence to back up those cases,"" he said. The sheriff's critics, he said, are ""being portrayed as martyrs and I feel that's absolutely inaccurate."" Thomas paints a picture of Maricopa County as a pit of corruption that includes the judicial system, which he blames for his lack of convictions. ""We had to go into courts where the judges were collaborating with the targets of the investigations,"" he said. ""They were working together to thwart investigations (and) prosecutions."" The Arizona Bar Association takes a different view. Its ethics committee is currently considering a case against Thomas for his role in Arpaio's investigations of public officials, the association said. MacIntyre says it is up to the public to untangle the web of political intrigue surrounding Phoenix and its environs. ""The electorate is going to have to say we don't want to do this anymore, and we will vote one or more people out,"" he said. ""Right now the sheriff's polls indicate that the public still supports him rather overwhelmingly."" Whether the grand jury investigation or the threatened lawsuits bring change remains to be seen. Mike Lacey, a newspaper editor who was once arrested after criticizing Arpaio, says the end is not yet in sight: ""If you are a critic of the sheriff, or if you represent an opportunity for publicity, you become a target for this man.""","Maricopa County sheriff is known for being tough on prisoners and illegal immigrants .

"(CNN) -- Hadiya Masieh, a 32-year-old mother, was born a Hindu, received her early education in a Christian school, converted to Islam and joined a radical group in college. It's a story that makes her feel emotional and nervous as she recounts her past -- a past she has since renounced. Hadiya was only 18 years old when she became interested in Hizb ut Tahrir, a radical Islamic group. While studying for a degree in business at Brunel University in England, she became closely involved with the activities of Hizb ut Tahir. As a teenager, Hadiya had a natural inclination to learn about different religions and was drawn to Islam because of the focus on one God as the creator. Her quest to know more about the religion led her to meet members of Hizb ut Tahir on her college campus. Speaking of her early days with Hizb ut Tahrir, she reflects on her interaction with other members of the group: ""I was initially looking for spiritual understanding of Islam and they were trying to say that spirituality is important but their main focus was on politics and that the politics was just as spiritual in Islam."" She learned soon that the main aim of the group was a call for ""Khilafah,"" establishing a Muslim state. As a member of Hizb ut Tahir, Hadiya held regular talks and tried to recruit others to the group. She remembers that even though the group by itself did not get involved in acts of terrorism, the members never denounced violence perpetuated by others. Despite Hadiya's close and prolonged involvement with Hizb ut Tahrir, her parents remained unaware of the degree of their only daughter's involvement with a radical organization. Hesitant to speak of her relationship with her family, Hadiya reminisces, ""at the end of the day I was still a loving daughter towards them, and that's what they saw of me."" Sometime toward the end of her 10-year involvement with Hizb ut Tahrir, Hadiya began to question her work with the group and the message that was being sent out. ""When you are in a group like this, they talk about the same thing over and over again and eventually human nature will start to think it's not making a difference,"" she said. The July 7, 2005, London bombings killed more than 50 people and left the world in shock. And it proved to be a major turning point in Hadiya's life. ""I was heavily pregnant with my third child and when I was in the waiting room, looking at the screen, I just felt like hiding."" She shakes her head at the memory. Recollecting the images of 7/7 bombings, Hadiya adds, ""I think it was wake-up call for anyone in [Hizb ut Tahrir] who is living in Britain, whether they wanted to admit it or not."" After she gave birth to her youngest child, Hadiya began exploring a different path, a more moderate and spiritual approach to Islam. It was in 2008 that she finally severed ties with Hizb ut Tahrir and instead started giving talks in colleges to foster closer ties among communities. Both Hadiya and her husband, Dawud, who also is a former member of Hizb ut Tahrir, now work toward building better understanding among religions and communities. Hadiya recently helped organize a movie screening in North London for more than 70 Jewish and Muslim women as part of her work with a faith-based organization called Three Faiths Forum. ""I feel more at peace with what I am doing now,"" Hadiya says with a determined tone, ""because all of the messages that I am talking about now are very positive.""","Hadiya Masieh, 32, joined the radical Islamist group Hiz ut Tahrir while in college .

"(CNN) -- In October, when her newspaper merged with a competitor, Jamie Smith was laid off. ""I became one of the thousands -- maybe millions -- of people in the United States who became displaced,"" she told CNN iReport in December. ""Due to nothing of my fault, really no one's fault; it's the economy right now."" Smith, 30, who lives in Bentonville, Arkansas, began collecting unemployment and looked for opportunities to write on a freelance basis. She also decided to create her own public relations company . Through the first few months of the year, her goals seemed on track. She was writing for a variety of publications and a spring expo that she'd planned to launch her business was sold out. But in April, she ruptured her appendix. Complications developed, including the onset of gangrene, and she had to spend two weeks in the hospital. ""Basically, life halted,"" she said. Watch as Jamie talks about her hospitalization on CNN iReport . Luckily, her husband had ""great insurance,"" so they weren't saddled with expensive hospital bills. And the expo went on as planned in June. ""This is really not the most intelligent time to make a career change,"" she said recently. ""But life forces you to make some hard choices."" Selling a home ... in this economy? Michael Andrews faces a choice as well: Does he sell his home now? Or wait until the market gets better? Andrews, 33, lives in Bowie, Maryland, with his wife and 4-year-old son. He bought the home in 2005 but wanted to move to a bigger house in a nicer area. However, as the housing market collapsed, the price of his home fell. ""The cost of our home is such that we can't really leave until it flips back around to some kind of profit,"" he said when he first spoke to iReport in December. But as the year went on, the Andrews family realized it may be wiser to stay. ""You get more home for the value, schools are great, great amenities -- so we had to re-evaluate that,"" he said. Instead, Andrews, a college administrator, said he's spent the year investing in his career. He created fivemikes.com, a website devoted to his motivational speaking engagements. ""I work for the state of Maryland, and the state government is not really thriving right now,"" he said. ""I think that when times are as rough as they are right now in the economy, you really have to rely on yourself to take that extra leap."" A forced transition . Last year, Bruce Pollard retired from his information technology job of more than 25 years after his company filed for bankruptcy. He took on a consulting job, but it only made up for 20 percent of the salary he once earned. He set about looking for more work, but it wasn't necessarily what he ideally wanted to do. ""What I'd really like to do is teach [high school students] and contribute,"" he told iReport in February. ""But I can't afford to do that with my family and two kids going to college and another one coming up."" His wife, a psychologist who used to work one day a week, began working more, and between the two, they're ""filling up the work week,"" he says. Pollard, 58, says the first half of the year has been a transitory period, coping with the emotions and adjustments of no longer working a steady job. ""I'm trying how learning to take in the duties that my wife handed over to me,"" he said recently. ""You think that when you go away for five days a week and come back that things just happen around the house. But they don't."" A year for expansion . It's been a different sort of transition for Susan and David Nethero. Owners of Intimacy, a specialty bra company, they've overseen the opening of several stores across the U.S. this year. The company has been around for 18 years and had 11 stores at the start of the year. They've already opened three more stores: A second New York location, one in Los Angeles and another in Orange County. They have plans to open two more stores this year. Despite an economy where growth has been anemic and shaky, Intimacy has done well, the Netheros say. ""Our sales are trending exactly where we hoped they would be. In fact, we're a little bit ahead,"" Susan Nethero told iReport recently. ""That gives us great confidence for the economy and for the balance of our sales for the year. ""We're feeling very strong and very bullish."" Where tax season is 'like Christmas' Guy Daniels, the owner of Expressions Ink, a tattoo parlor in Wausau, Wisconsin, says he was a bit nervous when the year began. At the time, Expressions Ink relied on longtime customers and people who were using gift certificates from the holidays. Walk-in traffic ""took a dive with a lot of layoffs in town,"" he told iReport. As the year progressed, he began cutting costs where he could and invested a bit of money on a new computer and advertising. ""Figured you have to spend money to make money,"" he said. Things began looking up when tax season arrived, a time when refunds give customers more disposable income to spend. ""People are more spontaneous with their money at tax time,"" Daniels said. ""It's like Christmas for us."" The shop is holding steady for now, but Daniels predicts the next six months, when revenue from tax season and other such bumps will recede, will give a better indication of what the economy is like for his business. 'A personal tiredness' Kathy Kirkpatrick, like Guy Daniels, is a small-business owner hoping to ride out the economy. She is the owner of Life Café. She has two locations in New York City, one in the East Village and another in Brooklyn. In the more than 20 years that Life Café has been around, 2008 was the worst economy she's ever seen, Kirkpatrick told iReport. But as this year began, she sounded optimistic. ""I have jobs for people, and I'm able to provide that. I'm so grateful for that,"" she said. Business has been good, but not strong, for the past six months. The springtime, when tourists frequent the café, wasn't similar to years past. However, she says, in retrospect, the recession has been something of a benefit. The café's management has cut down on costs and learned how to make better decisions, she said. ""You have to understand profit and loss, for the small business owner, comes incrementally,"" she said earlier this year. ""A few hundred here and there in costs adds up. ... It's the difference between success and failure, life or death."" The economy of the past two years has also made her more pragmatic. ""Besides a personal tiredness, the recession has made me cautious of the eggs I do have in my basket,"" she said. ""I don't have the time in front of me to take any more risks like I used to. I have to be realistic.""","CNN iReporters are following people they know throughout 2010 to get a measure of how things are going in the economy .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Large and small donations flowed in Monday evening as dozens of celebrities answered phones for Larry King's telethon to help the people of the U.S. Gulf Coast suffering from the oil disaster. ""A hundred dollars? Wow! Thanks you so much,"" rocker Tyson Ritter told one donor who called in. The two-hour CNN show raised $1.3 million with proceeds going to three charities deeply involved in the efforts to help humans, wildlife and the environment. ""Everyone's really pissed off,"" actress Jenny McCarthy, who was monitoring online messages in the telethon's ""Tweet Suite,"" told host Ryan Seacrest. Donors could choose to send their money to the United Way, National Wildlife Federation or The Nature Conservancy. Celebrity journalist Giuliana Rancic said she was on the phone with ""Barbara"" from Kokomo, Indiana. ""She's saying it's the animals,"" Rancic said. Actress Victoria Principal sat next to her on another call. ""We're just talking about the wildlife,"" Principal said. Singer Aaron Neville, a New Orleans native, said most of the calls he answered in New York were from people concerned about animals impacted by the oil. ""People are crying on the phone and giving money,"" Neville said. Actor Ted Danson said it was important for him to ""hear people's emotions, their fear and sadness"" when they called in donations, . CNN correspondents reported live from the Gulf Coast, interviewing people whose lives have been interrupted by the oil disaster. ""The toughest thing I see is losing a way of life that we've had down here for generations and generations,"" said shrimper Archie Dantin in Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana. A BP spokesman issued a statement Monday saying the oil company is ""proceeding with urgency to make the situation right for the environment and for those who have affected by this tragic event."" ""We stated from the beginning that we accept responsibility for cleaning up the spill and for paying all legitimate claims for those directly impacted financially by this environmental disaster,"" BP's statement said.

"Mojave, California (CNN)  -- Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson on Monday unveiled the winged rocket his company developed to give paying customers a brief taste of space. The 300 people who have given Branson's Virgin Galactic $20,000 deposits toward the $200,000 space-ride tickets were invited see SpaceShipTwo in its Mojave, California, hangar. CNN was given an early peek. The first flight in 2011 -- after 18 months of testing -- will launch from a spaceport under construction in New Mexico, Branson said. Another aircraft will carry the 60-foot-long SpaceShipTwo to 60,000 feet above the Earth, where ""they will drop away and they will then go to 2,000 miles per hour in 10 seconds, where they get propelled into space,"" Branson said. Its hybrid rocket motor -- still under development -- will reach a suborbital altitude high enough to reach the edges of space and weightlessness, according to Branson. ""Once in space, [passengers] will unbuckle their seats,"" he said. ""There are enormous windows, which no spacecraft has had before, for them to look back at the Earth. They can float around and become astronauts."" The cabin, which seats six paying passengers, is 90 inches -- nearly 8 feet -- in diameter, which provides ""lots of room for zero-G fun,"" Branson's Web site said. The first voyage will carry Branson, his wife, mother and children, the entrepreneur  said. ""Actually, that's my mum on the side -- a younger version of my mum on the side of the spaceship,"" he said. After just a few minutes of space tourism, SpaceShipTwo will glide back to Earth, landing where it began the trip in New Mexico, he said. About 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list for seats on SpaceShipTwo and its successors. ""What we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space, and they never dreamed that [they] could,"" Branson said. He said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of Earth travel, jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes. ""We would love at some stage, obviously subject to government approval, to take the engineers and start looking at shrinking the world,"" Branson said. The spacecraft was based on the technology and carbon-composite construction developed for SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize in 2004 for the first privately funded human flight to the edge of space. The reusable spacecraft is a joint effort by aviation designer Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic, a space tourism venture that is a subsidiary of Branson's Virgin Group.","Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson unveils spacecraft .

"Oakland, California (CNN) -- Police arrested dozens of people in downtown Oakland, California, Thursday night after hundreds protested the verdict in the trial of a white former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man, Oakland police officials told CNN. Police issued a variety of charges, including failure to disperse, resisting arrest, burglary, vandalism and assaulting a police officer. Police initially reported 83 people had been arrested, but later reduced the number to 78. The former officer, Johannes Mehserle, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Thursday, a conviction that usually carries a maximum four-year sentence. But some in Oakland hoped for conviction on a charge that would carry a tougher penalty for the former police officer, and took to the streets in protest. Crowds broke the glass of a Foot Locker and other stores. Others threw sneakers out of the store as police wearing gas masks stormed the area. At the high point of the protests, about 8 p.m., there were an estimated 800 people in the streets, Oakland Police Chief Anthony Batts said. By 10:30 p.m., there were about 75 left, he said. The protests were contained to the downtown area, police said. Police said they were still collecting information on the total number of businesses that were vandalized. Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums downplayed the demonstrations. ""People were preparing for everything to explode, but I am extremely happy that so far it has not, and I hope that it doesn't,"" Dellums said. ""We're not going to tear our own community apart, because we've got issues that we've got to deal with."" Oakland police had prepared for protests and ways of quelling the demonstrations days before the verdict. Mehserle could have been found not guilty, guilty of second-degree murder, guilty of voluntary manslaughter or, as the jury decided, guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Mehserle, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer at the time of the incident, was accused of shooting 22-year-old Oscar Grant on an Oakland train platform on January 1, 2009. The trial was moved from Alameda County to Los Angeles because of pretrial publicity. Mehserle, wearing a gray suit, blue shirt and red tie, showed no emotion during the reading of the verdict. The former officer did not say anything to Superior Court Judge Robert Perry or attorneys. About a dozen Los Angeles County deputies escorted the handcuffed defendant out of the courtroom after the verdict was announced. Outside the courtroom, Grant family members expressed outrage at the verdict. ""My son was murdered. He was murdered. He was murdered. My son was murdered,"" said Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson. ""The system has let us down, but God will never ever let us down."" Johnson and other speakers said African-Americans have been the victims of police abuse and a biased judicial system. She said Mehserle wasn't found accountable. ""We couldn't get even six hours of deliberations,"" said Johnson, who accused jurors of being unfair. Sentencing is set for August 6. Involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of up to four years in prison under California law. But the judge could add an ""enhancement"" that could provide a longer sentence because a firearm was used. Members of the jury, which included no African-Americans, said they were unanimous in their decision. Their finding indicates that Mehserle was criminally negligent. The shooting was captured on a bystander's cell-phone video camera. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland. The video showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to Oakland's Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale. Mehserle said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun. He resigned his position a few days after the incident and was later arrested in Nevada. CNN's Sara Weisfelt contributed to this report.","NEW: 78 protesters arrested in Oakland after verdict .

"(CNN) -- Arguments over the massive overhaul of the health care system -- which congressional Democrats hope to pass by next month -- are expected to keep shaking up the country long after the vote. Congress' plan could be the first legislation of its kind passed along strict partisan lines. In modern history, legislation of such scope -- including Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965 -- has had at least some support from the opposition. ""The bottom line is that, unlike other major legislation which has passed with more bipartisan support, health care is going to remain a political football, and people are going to have a sense that it is not fully settled yet for a while,"" said David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN who also worked in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations. ""It's sign of the unhealthy quality of our politics that a bill this significant in our social history is passing with only one party in favor,"" he said. Sarah Binder, an expert on Congress and legislative politics with the Brookings Institution, said that in the past two decades, Republicans and Democrats have become increasingly polarized. ""It just seems that the incentive to disagree seems to be growing,"" she said. Because of the ideological polarization, the parties are growing further apart in policy terms, and thus reaching across the aisle is becoming a tougher task, Binder said. The polarization, coupled with another development in recent history -- partisan team play -- has contributed to the heightened partisan rancor surrounding the health care debate, she said. Partisan team play is more about keeping a party cohesive and opposed to the other party than it is about underlying policy, she added, comparing this session of Congress to the 103rd, the last time Democrats controlled Congress and the White House. There was a ""whole slew of Democratic initiatives in '93-94 where Republicans said, 'We're not going to vote for these,' "" Binder said. Ilona Nickels, a congressional analyst and lecturer, said that with the current health care legislation, there was never much hope for bipartisanship, because the divide between the parties over the role and size of government intervention is ""a pre-existing issue."" ""Once you grow government to tackle any major societal problem, it is doubtful you would be able to bring any Republicans aboard,"" she said in an e-mail to CNN. No Republicans supported the bill passed in the Senate, and the House version received just one Republican vote. Before a final bill can be sent to President Obama's desk, the two versions must be merged into one and voted on again. Senior Democratic sources say that a traditional House-Senate conference committee is unlikely to meet to work out differences, because that would allow the GOP to slow the progress in the Senate. Democratic leaders from both chambers may instead circumvent the traditional process through informal, high-level talks, the sources said. Most Americans disapprove of the current health care legislation, according to CNN's most recent polling. ""In addition to the polarization that already exists, there is deep polarization in the country about the bill itself on the merits,"" Gergen said. ""There may be instances, but I can't think of them, when a major piece of domestic legislation has passed in the teeth of public disapproval."" Nickels, who spent several years as a congressional staff aide, pointed to the 1980s for an example of the risks of acting on legislation without public support. Congress passed the Catastrophic Coverage Act in 1988. The legislation was intended to expand Medicare to protect seniors against catastrophic medical expenses. To pay for it, enrollees saw higher monthly premiums and a surtax. Senior citizens became livid when they fully understood its impact, Nickels said. Democratic Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois championed the legislation, which was enacted with the help of the AARP. Nickels recalled that angry voters booed the congressman and pelted his car with eggs. The law was repealed in 1989. ""In the battle of the spin wars to come on the health care bill, no one should underestimate the public's reaction once the impact of the bill's provisions become clearer and, if enacted, actually felt,"" Nickels said. Still, it's an important historical win for Obama if he signs the health care bill into law, Gergen said. ""What the White House hope would be is that over time, people would come to appreciate it. People will adjust and find that the benefits of the bill far outweigh the negatives and that it will be a major plus for his party over time. Right now it's not,"" he added. Debate over the legislation will play a key role in the upcoming midterm elections, with Democrats pushing its benefits and Republicans slamming its costs. ""It's pretty clear at the moment that unless opinion swings in favor of the bill, as it may, then Republicans will run against the reform in 2010 elections and probably in 2012. And that will present the prospect that over time they can change it,"" Gergen said, noting that even some Democrats have said they intend to change the bill over time. But in order for Republicans to make gains at the polls, it would take a ""delicate balancing act"" since those gains would likely come from independent voters, said Republican strategist Karen Hanretty. Independent voters are fiscally conservative and wary of the massive price tag attached to health care reform, but they also don't like partisanship, she noted. Anticipating some conservative Democrats losing in this year's congressional elections, Nickels said she thinks the White House is knowingly sacrificing some members of its own party in exchange for what the administration believes will be a seminal accomplishment. CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Partisan vote a sign of ""unhealthy quality of our politics,"" David Gergen says .

"(CNN) -- Concerns about alcohol abuse have been making headlines this week. A woman who drinks two glasses of wine every day  is at risk for developing liver trouble, a doctor says. First, the Indian state of Rajasthan reportedly announced it would shut down 800 alcohol shops. Then, in Britain, chief medical officer Liam Donaldson recommended Thursday that anyone 15 years old and younger avoid alcohol completely. It's no wonder people are worried. A recent survey of alcoholism studies in the Lancet suggests that men have more than a 20 percent lifetime risk of developing alcohol-use disorders, while women's risk is 8 to 10 percent. Much of that risk is inherited. Studies show that as much as 60 percent of the risk of alcohol-use disorders is genetic, said Dr. Marc Schuckit, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, and director of the alcohol and drug treatment program at the Veterans Affairs-San Diego Healthcare System, who wrote the Lancet article. The risk for alcoholism is four times greater for children of alcoholics, even those who are adopted by non-alcoholic families, Schuckit said. But people who have a genetically influenced disorder can control it by behaving responsibly. Just as someone at risk for diabetes shouldn't exacerbate the problem by becoming overweight, someone with a family history of alcoholism must avoid drinking too much. ""If you know you're at risk, it's your responsibility to avoid the problems,"" Schuckit said. Why is the risk so much greater in men than women? Psychiatrists point out that young women also have twice the rate of depression and anxiety that men do, and daughters of alcoholic fathers tend more toward depression than alcoholism, said Dr. Charles Raison, psychiatrist and director of the Mind/Body Institute at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. ""There may be a similar underlying neurobiology to a lot of psychiatric conditions, and how they manifest in particular has something to do with circumstances, has something to do with gender, and has something to do with age,"" Raison said. There are also cultural factors in this gender pattern, but less is known about them, he said. He said women tend toward alcoholism in their 40s and 50s -- which may be their way of counteracting anxiety -- around the time that men tend to develop depression. Another genetic trait is involved in sensitivity to alcohol. Japanese, Chinese, and Korean people tend to have a mutation in their alcohol-metabolizing genes that makes them more sensitive -- meaning they tend to drink less than people from other backgrounds, he said. Data show that the earlier you start drinking away from your family, the greater the risk of alcohol problems later in life, he said.  On average, people begin drinking apart from the family at 15, a number that hasn't changed much in decades, Schuckit said. How much is too much? Male livers can metabolize about twice as much alcohol as females', meaning men can drink about twice as much as women before it becomes dangerous, Raison said. ""A woman who drinks two glasses of wine every day of her life is actually at risk for developing liver trouble,"" Raison said. Recommended drinking habits vary from person to person. To reap the health benefits from wine, a glass to a glass-and-a-half a day is recommended for women, and twice that amount for men, he said. Getting help . Treating alcoholism is similar to helping people with other chronic conditions -- for example, getting a diabetic person to be compliant with medications, Schuckit said. With both alcoholism and diabetes, therapy involves working with a person to alter behavior and help watch for signs of relapse. ""The core of treatment for any long term chronic disorder that requires changes in how you do things in life is to help people to recognize that they have a problem, and they can do something about it,"" Schuckit said. A combination of medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy is usually the best treatment option for alcoholism, Schuckit said. Cognitive-behavioral therapy involves changing a person's mindset -- recognizing the problem -- and improving behavior. Three medications are available in the U.S. to treat alcoholism, Schuckit said. A drug called acamprosate targets the nervous system and helps people decrease their craving by allowing them to sleep better and feel less anxious. Naltrexone, on the other hand, blocks opioid receptors and dampens the good feelings that would normally come along with drinking. These two in combination work slightly better than either alone, he said. A third option is disulfiram, which actually paralyzes the ability of one of the alcohol metabolizing enzymes to work, he said. That makes it especially nauseating and, in rare cases, deadly, for a person taking the drug to drink alcohol. Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous that offer 12-step programs are great resources, and they're free, Schuckit said. While imperfect, 12-step programs are often the best option, Raison said.","Study: Men have more than a 20 percent lifetime risk of alcohol-use disorders .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago police officer was shot and killed Wednesday afternoon during a struggle with a suspect in a police facility parking lot, police said. Officer Thor Soderberg was walking to his vehicle in the parking lot at 61st and Racine on the city's South Side, after completing a shift with the department's Operation Protect Youth program, when he encountered the offender, said James Jackson, assistant superintendent of police operations. ""The 24-year-old suspect disarmed the officer and then shot him,"" Jackson said at a news conference Wednesday night. The department believes the suspect then was involved in an armed robbery a short distance away from the shooting, where he fired additional shots, said Jackson. ""Several officers quickly responded and there was an exchange of gunfire with the offender. The suspect was shot. His injuries are non-life threatening,"" said Jackson. The suspect was in stable condition at Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, according to a police spokesman. Soderberg was 43 years old and an 11-year veteran of the department, said Jackson. He was most recently assigned to the department's education and training division.","NEW: Chicago police identify officer killed in struggle .

"(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday. Polygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor. A grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith. On Thursday, another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest. Those offenses took place in Colorado City, Arizona, in 2003, according to the indictment. Both indictments state that Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), committed the offenses ""as an accomplice."" According to Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison. Incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2½ years in prison. ""The cases involve two separate victims,"" Smith said in the statement. ""Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his Utah case is resolved."" Jeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin. The trial initially was set to begin in April, but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it earlier this year, and a new date has not been set. At the time, Shumate said the delay was due to ""recent information in the case,"" but he did not elaborate. The judge in March refused a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County because of press coverage, but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection. Utah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because Jeffs insisted she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape. During his preliminary hearing in December, Jeffs' defense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and, if it was, whether the sex was consensual. The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, testified at the preliminary hearing that she was ""so scared"" during the forced wedding. ""The whole time I was crying,"" she said. ""I wanted to die."" The rape as an accomplice charge is a first-degree felony in Utah, carrying a penalty upon conviction of five years to life in prison. Jeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy. Those charges, from 2005, were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah. Jeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time, he had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for months. The FLDS freely practices polygamy in the towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, which straddle the state line. The sect maintains groups of followers in Texas, South Dakota, Nevada, British Columbia and Mexico. The offshoot sect broke from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the practice of polygamy. The Mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to Jeffs' group. E-mail to a friend .","In May, polygamist leader indicted on charges in 2002 case .

"Washington (CNN) -- The tale contains elements of a spy thriller: a soldier in Iran's feared Revolutionary Guard turns spy for the CIA after concluding that the government that had promised democracy had instead ushered in oppression, violence and death. But Reza Kahlili says this is no novel. In his new book, ""A Time to Betray: The Astonishing Double Life of a CIA Agent Inside the Revolutionary Guards of Iran,""  Kahlili offers a first-hand account of how he turned against the Islamic regime that he said has oppressed its people for three decades. In one of his first public appearances, Kahlili addressed a packed hall Friday at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Flanked by a bodyguard and disguised in a hat, mask and glasses, he spoke through a modulator that led Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to liken his voice to Darth Vader's. Even his name is a pseudonym, all in an effort to protect his family, friends and contacts, he said. The author said that, after a peaceful childhood in Iran, he came to the United States in the 1970s for college, studying computer science at the University of Southern California, where he enjoyed a carefree life of parties, watching football and listening to Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull. He returned home after the sudden death of his father to find a country embroiled in change. Kahlili describes the immediate aftermath of the 1979 revolution against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi as a special time in Iran. Iranians had been led to believe democracy was theirs, the clergy wouldn't interfere in their lives and the people would have freedom of speech, assembly and political affiliation, he said. Everyone was excited about the direction of the country, he said. It was then that Khalili's friend told him about an opportunity with the newly formed, elite Revolutionary Guard, which hired him immediately. Reza said he quickly became disillusioned when he saw people being tortured and murdered and women raped in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison. Repressing his countrymen, he said, was not what he had signed up for. But rather than quit the Guard and endanger his family, he contacted the CIA and began work as an American agent under the code name ""Wally,"" he said. There was no magic watch or pen or fancy car like James Bond, he said, just a pencil and a notebook. He was trained in communications and deciphering codes. Kahlili said his role ""was to look and act the part of a devout Muslim enforcing all the new rules laid down by the mullahs."" ""A full black beard was a mandatory accessory to the Guard's uniform, and I sported one along with every other member of the Guards. The image of a scowling, black-bearded Guard in uniform mustered fear and garnered respect. Playing the part of a zealot did not come naturally to me, and there were times I had to do things I dreaded: cautioning young girls to cover up, barking at kids for not displaying proper Islamic behavior, taking on the persona of a fanatic. I knew I would have to try to convince myself that doing these things allowed me to maintain my role -- and maintaining my role allowed me to contribute to the downfall of the organization to which I so fervently imitated allegiance."" He said he provided critical information to his CIA handlers about Iran's role in the Iran-Iraq war, the Iran-contra affair, the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which he said was masterminded by Tehran. Kahlili described a CIA that knew little about what was going on inside Iran and was complacent about finding out the truth about the regime. He said he warned his case officers in the mid-1980s about the growing danger of the Guard, but said U.S. officials sat idly by, alternating indifference and negotiation with the regime he was working to take down. This ""misconception"" of Iran, he said, has plagued America's decisionmaking for three decades. After a few scares in which he thought his cover was blown, Kahlili left Iran, was granted asylum in the United States and moved to California. He said he no longer works for the CIA, but still provides the agency with information from his contacts in Iran about the regime, its nuclear program, its terrorist activities in the region and its continued oppression of the Iranian people. He said that, after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2005 election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadenijad, he decided to speak out publicly to raise awareness of the brutality of the regime. He predicted that Iran will eventually attack Israel, Europe and the Gulf and advocated a preemptive military strike against the regime but not against the Iranian people or infrastructure. Kahlili accused the Obama administration of naivete and betrayal for seeking to engage Iran. Not only does the regime see this as weakness on the part of the United States, he said, but the Iranian people view it as a betrayal of the highest order as they fight for freedom. ""Stop dreaming, please,"" he said Friday. ""You are not dealing with rational people. Every time you extend a hand, it is not seen as sincerity, but stupidity."" The CIA's public affairs office in Washington was not open Friday night and its telephone number would not accept messages; its e-mail account rejected two attempts to send it a message.","Former member of the Revolutionary Guard describes life as a CIA spy .

"(CNN) -- Aruban authorities are urging Natalee Holloway's father, Dave Holloway, to delay volunteer search efforts in her disappearance until police get better information on the case from Peruvian investigators who have spoken to Joran van der Sloot, prosecutor Peter Blanken said. Police do not want their investigation jeopardized or possible evidence contaminated in the Bubali Bird Sanctuary, a swamp area where Joran once said he dumped Holloway's body, Blanken said. Aruban authorities wish to search a more focused area once they receive more information from van der Sloot and his laptop, which may include files linking him to the Holloway disappearance. Earlier, Blanken said investigators from Aruba would not be able to question van der Sloot until Peruvian authorities finish their probe of the May 30 slaying of Stephany Flores. The formalities of Peruvian law also will determine the time frame, the prosecutor said. Aruban and Peruvian authorities agreed to ""help each other"" in the Flores case. Van der Sloot, a 22-year-old Dutch citizen, was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance but released for lack of evidence. Aruba is part of the Netherlands. He said he was in Peru for a poker tournament and met Flores while gambling. Police have said they think van der Sloot killed Flores to steal money she won. Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case.","Natalee Holloway's father wants to search swamp area for daughter's remains .

However, traffic at Austerlitz station had resumed as of 6 p.m. (noon ET), CNN affiliate BFM reported, citing officials with railway agency. Electronic repairs on the railway had been completed by the evening, and traffic was expected to run smoothly by Sunday. Earlier, railway officials had warned of delays and encouraged passengers to postpone their trips. Passengers who were unable to take trains Saturday will be issued refunds, BFM reported. The station is used by trains leaving for southern France and Spain as well as commuter service to other parts of Paris.","NEW: Report: Traffic at Austerlitz station resumes .

"(CNN) -- Portugal took a big step to escaping the World Cup's so-called ""group of death"" by crushing North Korea 7-0 in a rematch of the two nations' famous 1966 clash in South Africa on Monday. Forty-four years ago, the communist country's team shocked the soccer world by taking a 3-0 lead after only 24 minutes of their quarterfinal in England, but the Europeans hit back to win 5-3 with four goals from star forward Eusebio. There was to be no repeat in rain-drenched Cape Town, as Portugal found form after the disappointing opening draw with the Ivory Coast and claimed second place in Group G ahead of Friday's final round of matches. Carlos Queiroz's team led just 1-0 at halftime thanks to a 29th-minute strike from Raul Meireles as the North Koreans again showed the fighting spirit that tested Brazil in their opening 2-1 defeat. But the floodgates opened in the second spell as Simao Sabrosa, Hugo Almeida and Tiago scored in the space of eight minutes, then substitute Liedson netted to clinch the biggest winning margin of the tournament so far. Captain Cristiano Ronaldo and then Tiago again compounded the Koreans' misery, giving the Portuguese a massive goal-difference advantage over the Ivorians ahead of their eagerly-anticipated showdown with leaders Brazil. The Brazilians have already qualified for the second round, with six points from two victories, while the Portuguese have four points and the Ivory Coast one. ""We got seven goals but only three points. We need to be more ambitious and determined for the next phase,"" Queiroz told AFP. ""We were very determined to win this game but the game we played today will not help us overcome Brazil. We don't want Brazil to score any goals because this will put our reputation, our prestige, into question."" Portugal went close to opening the scoring in the seventh minute when defender Ricardo Carvalho hit the post with a powerful header from a corner. Meireles, who scored the winner in the second leg of Portugal's qualifying playoff against Bosnia, broke the deadlock when he ran onto a fine threaded pass from midfielder Tiago and slotted coolly past Ri Myong-Guk. Eight minutes after halftime, winger Simao fired a shot through the goalkeeper's legs after being set up by Meireles and Almeida. Striker Almeida, recalled after missing the first match, then headed in Fabio Coentrao's left-wing cross on 56 minutes before Ronaldo laid on the third goal for Tiago on the hour mark. Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player, hit the crossbar in the 71st minute as he was denied his first goal of the tournament -- a similarly spectacular effort against the Ivory Coast also smashed into the woodwork. Liedson made it 5-0 after the besieged Korean defense failed to cut a cross by fellow substitute Duda 10 minutes later. Ronaldo finally found the net with two minutes to play, showing his trademark cheeky skill as he pushed the ball past the keeper and then juggled the rebound on his back before slotting into the empty goal. Tiago added his second just a minute later with a powerful header from a cross by another replacement, Miguel Veloso.","Portugal take a big step to escaping the World Cup's so-called ""group of death""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An aid ship trying to break Israel's blockade of Gaza still plans to aim for the Palestinian territory, its organizer told CNN on Sunday, despite Israel's foreign ministry saying it would likely dock elsewhere. But the activists on the boat will not resist if they are confronted by the Israeli military, said Youssef Sawani, the executive director of the Gadhafi Foundation, which is sending the boat. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak called the ship ""an unnecessary provocation."" The ship, launched by a charity headed by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's son, set sail from Greece on Saturday carrying 2,000 tons of aid. It should take 70 to 80 hours -- about three to three-and-a-half days -- to reach Gaza, Sawani said. The Gadhafi Foundation refers to the ship as the Hope, although it appears to be registered formally as the MV Amalthea. It is Moldovan flagged and run by ACA Shipping, based in Greece. ""This is purely a humanitarian effort,"" he said, adding ""The Israelis should seize this opportunity and allow the goods into Gaza."" Aside from the ship's crew, Sawani says nine others are on board: Six Libyans, one Moroccan and one person from Niger, all of whom work with the Gadhafi Foundation, plus a journalist from Al Jazeera, Sawani added. Israel insists on controlling the entry of all goods into Gaza, which is run by the militant movement Hamas, because it says it must keep weapons out of the hands of people determined to attack it. Barak said Israel would not allow the aid ship to dock in Gaza, but said it could unload goods elsewhere and Israel would allow them to enter the Palestinian territory by land after Israel inspects them. ""Goods can be transferred into Gaza through the port of Ashdod after they are inspected, but we will not allow the transfer of weapons or ammunition into Gaza,"" he said. ""We recommend to the organizers of the flotilla to allow navy vessels to escort it to the port of Ashdod or sail directly to el-Arish"" in Egypt. Israeli commandos boarded a Turkish aid ship in May, resulting in violence between the troops and the activists on the ship that left nine Turks dead. The raid prompted international condemnation and threatened Israeli-Turkish relations. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Guy Azriel and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: Ship should take about three days to reach Gaza .

"(CNN) -- The Federal Reserve Board announced an $85 billion plan Tuesday to bail out troubled insurance giant American International Group Inc. Suze Orman says it's a good thing the federal government bailed out troubled national insurer AIG. The federal government decided to intervene after determining a failure of the company, whose financial dealings stretch around the world, could hurt the already delicate markets and the economy. Personal finance expert Suze Orman appeared on ""Larry King Live"" on Tuesday to discuss what the AIG bailout means to you and how safe is your money during this economic downturn. The following is an edited version of the interview: . Larry King: A few months ago, you said on this very show that you would be worried if there was another big government bailout. It's now happening. Should the government be helping AIG? Suze Orman: Well, in this particular case, I have to tell you they should. Bear Stearns, very different. Lehman, very different. AIG is an international giant that just doesn't have ramifications here in the United States. It is worldwide. They're like in 130 countries. They have 100,000 employees. Everybody has an AIG insurance policy. So in this particular case, my opinion, thank God, they bailed out AIG.  Watch Orman discuss what AIG's bailout means for consumers » . King: What about Barclays and Lehman? Orman: They're selling Neuberger Berman to Barclays, that's fine. That will all work itself out. The major danger that we had here, which is why you saw the stock markets go up today, is that rumors were circulating that AIG was going to be saved. The big downfall would have been if AIG, in my opinion, had gone under. King: Sen. McCain is saying this involves fraud -- or let me use another word similar to fraud -- on Wall Street. Do you agree? Orman: It starts way back when there was nobody overseeing and regulating. Nothing. It's how many times have I said on this program, what were they all thinking? Why were they lending money to people who shouldn't have been borrowing money? Why were they packaging these things? What about the rating agencies? Why weren't the rating agencies rating everything the way they should have been and now they're making matters worse? So whether it's fraud or not, was there deceit going on? I don't know if it was deceit as much as just total irresponsibility is what caused this.  Watch Larry's cure for US economic problems » . King: Is this a good time to get into the market? Orman: No. It's not a good time to get in with brand-new money. I would let these markets kind of wash themselves out. On the other hand, if you're investing in a 401k every month with small amounts of money, that's OK as long as you don't need the money for 10, 15, 20 years. If you just got an inheritance and you have $50,000, should you be putting it in the stock market now? Are you kidding? These are the markets that you just sit on the sidelines and wait on the sidelines and stay away from them until everything works out. iReport.com: Are you worried about the Wall Street crisis? King: Oil settled down today to $91.15 a barrel. What does that mean? Are gas prices going to go down? Orman: Yes. Gas prices probably will go down, I hope, to essentially $3 a gallon. What you're essentially seeing here is like a tax rebate for everybody. That's a lot of people that will help them a lot. Lehman, AIG -- I get that's all bad news, but the good news is for the main people that have to get by every single day. Your gas bills, in terms of what you put in your cars, aren't going to be as high. Your heating bills aren't going to be as high. To go from $150 a barrel down to $91, that's significant. King: The Federal Reserve decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged today at 2 percent. Good or bad? Orman: I personally think it was bad. Listen, the banks in the United States of America are in trouble. Anything we can do, in my opinion, to help the banking system so they can make a little bit more money, I think, would have been a good idea. If we had lowered interest rates, the Fed funds rate, the banks would have been making more money on the money that they lent out, which would be helping everybody in the long run. So I think they should have lowered, but they left the same. King: Could other major financial institutions go under? Orman: Absolutely, they can. You would think that they couldn't, but when you see dinosaurs -- Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, AIG -- going down the drain, anything can happen. Nothing is beyond the imagination at this point in time.","Suze Orman: It's good that federal government stepped in to save AIG .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP said Sunday that it is ""pleased"" with how the operation to place a new cap on its ruptured undersea well is proceeding. Officials hope the containment cap will stop oil from gushing into the Gulf. But while robots replace the old cap, crude is flowing freely. The procedure -- expected to take four to seven days -- continued to progress Sunday as crews worked to position a transition spool over the gushing well to prepare for the new connection, according to BP's Senior Vice President Kent Wells. ""We're pleased with how it's going,"" Wells said, but cautioned that the operation, which began Saturday with the removal of the old cap, is only in its second day. Robots removed six giant bolts from the apparatus early Sunday so that the new cap could be positioned. If successful, the effects of the containment cap operation could halt the oil gusher that started April 20 after a deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico. But officials have said the new containment cap would be a temporary fix, and the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well. There are two relief wells under construction. Wells said Sunday that one of the relief wells could intercept the ruptured well as early as the end of July. ""We're feeling very good about how we've positioned that well,"" he said. The other relief well is expected to be completed in August. The old cap had been diverting about 15,000 barrels a day (630,000 gallons) to a ship. BP still is recovering an additional 8,000 to 9,000 barrels a day (336,000 to 378,000 gallons) through a line connected to another vessel, the Q4000. ""As we start to ramp up the additional containment capacity, we should see less and less flow,"" Wells said. The Helix Producer recovery vessel is expected to begin collecting oil Sunday evening, Wells said, and officials hope to reach its full collection capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels (840,000 to 1.5 million gallons) per day within three days. Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels (2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons) a day should be collected as part of the containment process, Wells said. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from BP's breached well. BP says there will be a period of decreased oil and gas capture from the wellhead during the cap replacement. It said another recovery vessel, the Q4000, ""should continue to capture and flare oil and gas.""  There will be other recovery vessels and skimmers deployed. Two more oil skimmers were added to the Gulf Sunday bringing the total to 48 collecting an oil and water mix from the surface, BP officials said. And another 15 burns were conducted in calm seas. ""It was a good day in trying to contain the oil that made it out to the surface,"" Wells said. Wells also said there will be ""significant measurement capability"" added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate. BP said in a statement that the new cap ""should improve containment efficiency during hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnect and reconnect times."" Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Friday that the new cap would allow responders to collect more accurate oil flow data and that, once the switch is complete, the resulting capacity to contain oil ""will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems.""","NEW: Crews position transition spool to prepare for new connection .

"(CNN) -- A month of intense competition reaches its climax Sunday when either the Netherlands or Spain will make history by claiming its first ever World Cup title. Hours before kickoff at Johannesburg's Soccer City Stadium the drone of vuvuzelas could be heard thousands of miles away at Amsterdam's Museumsplein, where some 200,000 fans are expected to watch the match. Supporters milled in the streets wearing the national color orange as construction workers fitted the final nuts and bolts to television screens erected around a vast lawn. Towering above them was a poster of Queen Beatrix's grand-daughter blowing a vuvuzela. Anticipation was also thick in the air in Spain, where hundreds of fans, decked out in red and yellow, arrived early in Madrid's main boulevard to reserve a spot to watch the action on four huge television screens. Rather than vuvuzelas, fans brandished small trumpets known as ""pitos"" or whistles. The pitos joined the cacophony of singing, chanting and tooting of car horns as children milled about with painted faces. Writing in Spain's largest circulation daily El Pais, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero called Sunday ""the most glorious day in the history of Spanish football."" It is the first time the two nations have clashed at a World Cup finals. Spain is appearing in its first World Cup final. The Netherlands has been there twice before, but has lost both times -- 2-1 to West Germany in 1974 and four years later they lost 3-1 to Argentina. On Sunday, at 6.30 p.m. GMT (2.30 p.m. ET), several hundred million viewers are expected to tune into watch the final game in the month-long competition. Football's world governing body, FIFA, says this final could set viewing records, not only for the World Cup, but in television history. ""We don't want to speculate in numbers but we're hoping this will be the biggest [event] ever,"" Niclas Ericson, FIFA's director of television, said in a press conference from Soccer City Stadium, the final's venue. Around 715 million viewers worldwide watched the Azurri beat France to the title in 2006. The largest television event to date is thought to be the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games. In 2008, a global audience of one billion is thought to have watched at least part of the spectacle. Advertisers aren't the only businesses benefiting from the World Cup excitement. Spain's progression to the final has lifted consumer spirits in the middle of a severe economic crisis where unemployment is running close to 20 percent. Spanish flag sales were up six-fold thanks to the tournament, according to a leading flag maker in Colmenar Viejo, near Madrid. Pablo Verguilla, a store manager in Madrid, told CNN the World Cup had definitely boosted sales of his shirts and Spanish souvenirs. And local media reported about one million official La Roja team jerseys had sold at about 70 euros each, along with an unknown number of cheaper imitation merchandise. Spain's goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas was quoted as saying that knowing that people are going through hard times has motivated the team. Fans who spent money to fly to South Africa for the final started converging on Soccer City Stadium hours before the kick off to soak up the atmosphere and the sunny weather at the Soweto-based arena. Dutch fans outnumbered the Spanish by ten-to-one at the southern end of the stadium, with Holland fans living up to their reputation as the ""Orange Army,"" with most in attendance dressed head to toe in the national hue. CNN's Al Goodman, Don Riddell, Diana Magnay, Jonathan Wald, Per Nyberg and Ben Wyatt contributed to this report.","Excitement mounts in the Netherlands, Spain as fans await World Cup final .

"(CNN) -- After eluding authorities for years from Washington state to Indiana, a notorious teenage fugitive called the ""barefoot bandit"" was arrested Sunday following a high-speed boat chase in the Bahamas, police said. Police said 19-year-old Colton Harris-Moore was taken into custody without incident following the chase in the waters off Harbour Island. Authorities responded to a reported sighting of Harris-Moore just after 2 a.m ET Sunday, said police commissioner Ellison Greenslade. However, an account of the arrest offered by a spokeswoman for Romora Bay Resort and Marina described a dramatic capture befitting a James Bond film. The marina's security director, Kenneth Strachan, saw a barefoot young man about 2 a.m. Sunday carrying a gun with a knapsack over his shoulder running up the dock. ""They're going to kill me,"" the man told Strachan, according to a statement issued by the resort. The man had arrived on Harbour Island from the nearby island of Eleuthera in a 15-foot skiff, said resort manager Anne Ward in the statement. Strachan put out a call for help, telling Ward to come as soon as possible. Upon her arrival, Ward told guards to disable the skiff's engine as the man ran through the resort property, attempting to steal a boat from a nearby house as a crowd gathered at the marina, the statement said. However, Ward said he ran aground in the second boat, as he didn't realize how shallow the water was. Police and marina authorities surrounded his boat, and police shot out its engines, she said in the statement. ""At one point, the boy threw his computer in the water and put a gun to his head. He was going to kill himself. Police talked him out of it."" Authorities loaded the suspect into the resort's work truck and took him to the Harbour Island police station, she said. Harris-Moore was being transported to Nassau, Bahamas, on Sunday, authorities said. Greenslade said police seized a gun and other items from him. The fact that Strachan could call for help was significant, the resort said, noting phone service on Harbour Island has been erratic since an underwater cable was cut recently. The FBI held off on confirming that the suspect was indeed ""barefoot bandit"" Harris-Moore, with the agency saying it wanted to positively identify him through fingerprints. But Sunday night, the FBI announced its conclusion. ""We've confirmed that's it him -- the 'barefoot bandit,' Colton Harris Moore,"" said Steve Dean, assistant special agent in charge for the FBI's Seattle, Washington, office. Greenslade said earlier Sunday that the suspect was positively identified as Harris-Moore by local authorities, and that he was seen by a doctor following his arrest and ""appeared to be in very good health."" ""The first thing I thought was that it's my bad luck, because there's another one right next door he could have taken,"" said William Sport of Florida, who owns the second boat. He said he had just arrived on Harbour Island for his annual monthlong stay there, but that his 32-foot boat had enough fuel on board to make it back to Florida. Sport told CNN he had left the keys in the boat, although it had a cover on. The suspect took the cover off, found the keys and started the boat, he said. Sport said he believes he saw the suspect about midnight. He said he had just finished a dinner party on the boat and was walking down the dock when a young man ran past him. At the time, he thought nothing of it, he said. He found out later that the suspect had come back and swam to the boat from shore. Bahamian police have told him they will take care of repairs to his boat after shooting the engines out, he said. Harris-Moore is suspected of flying a stolen plane to the Bahamas. He has been on the run since 2008, when he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, after pleading guilty to three counts of burglary and being sentenced to three years. He was called the ""barefoot bandit"" because he was without shoes when he allegedly broke into houses. He has been linked to a series of home break-ins in Oregon and Washington, but authorities believed he moved eastward recently. He was suspected of breaking into airports in South Dakota and Nebraska, and also suspected in the thefts of several cars. Authorities in Madison County, Nebraska, issued an arrest warrant for him last month on charges of burglary and theft by unlawful taking or deception. The affidavit supporting the warrant details a crime spree fitting the alleged pattern of the elusive teen, who has amassed thousands of followers on Facebook. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington unsealed an indictment for airplane theft against Harris-Moore in the theft of an aircraft last year in Idaho, which was flown to Washington state and found crashed. DNA evidence and fingerprints linked Harris-Moore to the plane theft, the indictment states. Harris-Moore was linked to the theft of a single-engine plane last week at Monroe County Airport in Bloomington, Indiana. Bruce Payton, the airport director, said a 2009 Cessna 400 Corvalis was reported missing from a locked hangar. He said the owner of the plane was told by the U.S. Coast Guard that an emergency locator transmitter for the Cessna was sending out a beacon from the Bahamas. The plane was found just off Abaco Island in the Bahamas, police said, and evidence from the aircraft was taken by investigators. Authorities were also looking into several reported thefts and break-ins reported in the area since the crash-landing. The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. An FBI statement indicated that agents believe Harris-Moore was involved in the Indiana theft, with the statement saying, ""Should you see Harris-Moore in The Bahamas, please contact the nearest Royal Bahamas Police Force Station."" Greenslade said Harris-Moore is expected to appear in court later this week. Dean said he wasn't surprised at reports of Harris-Moore's arrest. ""I'm glad this is over,"" he said. ""There was a big effort to find him, and on a small island, there were a lot of burglaries ... eventually, he was bound to be caught,"" Dean said. In Yankton, South Dakota, on June 17, residents returned to find an intruder inside the house, said Assistant Police Chief Jerry Hisek. ""He'd eaten some of their food, took a shower, cut his hair,"" Hisek said of the intruder. ""He started to run and the guy chased him into the basement of the house."" The intruder ""laser-dotted the guy and said, 'I have a gun. Get out of here, or I'm going to kill you.'"" Hisek said the owner did not know if the individual had a laser pen or a gun. Harris-Moore was suspected in the incident, and ""we're classifying him as armed,"" Hisek said. In December, Time magazine dubbed Harris-Moore ""America's Most Wanted Teenage Bandit,"" and a Facebook site for him showed nearly 58,000 ""fans"" as of Sunday. Harris Moore's mother, Pamela Kohler, has told CNN affiliate KIRO that she wanted her son to turn himself in, but said she was ""proud"" her son had actually taught himself to fly. 20th Century Fox has purchased the rights for a film based on the exploits of the young fugitive. ""I think it's sad, very sad,"" Dean said Sunday of support for Harris-Moore. ""People have been making him an idol and a hero when he's hurt so many hard-working people, broken into homes, stolen property, ripped off businesses. It's pretty pitiful."" CNN's Joyce Joseph, Padma Rama, Susan Candiotti, Ross Levitt, Gabriel Falcon and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","NEW: FBI confirms suspect is ""barefoot bandit""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon on Wednesday began sending out to troops a survey of more than 100 questions seeking their views on the impact of repealing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" restrictions prohibiting gays and lesbians from openly serving in the U.S. military. An administration official confirmed to CNN that the survey is being sent to 200,000 active duty troops and 200,000 reserve troops. The official declined to be identified because the survey has not officially been made public. The survey, which service members can expect to receive via e-mail, asks about such issues as how unit morale or readiness might be affected if a commander is believed to be gay or lesbian; the need to maintain personal standards of conduct; and how repeal might affect willingness to serve in the military. The survey also asks a number of questions aimed at identifying problems that could occur when troops live and work in close quarters in overseas war zones. For example, the questionnaire asks military members how they would react if they had to share a room, bathrooms, and open-bay showers in a war zone with other service members believed to be gay or lesbian. There also are several questions about reactions to dealing with same-sex partners in social situations. The Pentagon established a team to conduct the survey earlier this year. President Barack Obama, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen have all publicly backed a repeal of the current policy. Defense Department officials insist the survey is aimed at determining the impact of a repeal -- not whether repeal should happen. Several members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have said they want to see the results of the survey before they offer their final advice on the impact of a repeal to Obama and Gates. In May, the House of Representatives approved a plan that would repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy after the military's internal review is completed and Obama, Gates, and Mullen to sign off on the policy change. The Senate, however, did not pass the measure. According to a senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the review process, the military needs until the end of 2010 to figure out how to implement a repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" in terms of housing, medical and marriage benefits, as well as issues involving the reinstatement of gay soldiers previously discharged under the policy. A major problem might be determining how to reconcile the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" with federal law that defines marriage as between a man a woman, the official said. In addition to distributing the survey, the Pentagon has also been soliciting opinions in a number of private meetings with troops. The results of the review will not be available until December, the official said. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Troops are receiving a Pentagon survey on gays in the military .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Garbage dumps are generally not associated with thriving coral reefs, vast mangrove plantations and rare bird species. Yet on Pulau Semakau off Singapore, this is exactly what you will find: just beside a secluded ecological zone that harbors dozens of rare plant, bird and fish species lies the world's first ecological offshore landfill. Located 8 kilometers south of Singapore and covering an area of 3.5 square kilometers, the Semakau Landfill was designed by engineers and environmentalists at Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA). It consists of two small islands that have been connected by a rock embankment. The area inside the landfill is divided into 11 bays, known as 'cells', which are lined with thick plastic and clay to prevent any harmful material from seeping into the sea. Since the landfill was put into use in 1999, four of the 11 cells have been filled, covered with earth and planted with grass. The landfill, which cost around $400 million, can hold up to 63 million cubic meters of rubbish, enough to satisfy Singapore's waste disposal needs until 2040. Clean and odor-free . What distinguishes Semakau from other landfills is that it is clean and free of smell. Two thirds of the material that comes to Semakau has passed through one of the city's four incinerators, reducing it to approximately ten percent of its original volume. Waste from construction material is also processed, while toxic waste like asbestos is packaged in such a way that it cannot leak into the surrounding environment. Two mangrove groves that were destroyed when the embankment was built have been replanted near the landfill and today they serve as biological indicators for the local environment. If they were to start dying, it would be seen as a sign that harmful material had leaked from the landfill. Scientists expected that some of the mangroves would not survive the relocation, but today they cover 1.4 square kilometers around the island and even have to be cut back in places -- a sign that the landfill is indeed leak-proof. Flourishing wildlife . Together with the island's other ecosystems such as seagrass meadows, coral reefs and sandy shores, the mangroves serve as a habitat for a variety of birds, fish and plants. The decision to build a landfill off Semakau was taken in the 1990's when the previous landfill on the main island had nearly reached capacity. ""As land is scarce in Singapore, it was decided from the outset that the new sanitary landfill in the smaller islands would be designed as an environmentally friendly facility which would be used to meet Singapore's land use needs when it was eventually filled up and closed,"" the NEA explained in an official statement. Every effort was made to minimize the impact on the local environment so that the area beside the landfill, which always had a rich flora and fauna, has remained intact. ""Great effort went into making sure that the impact of the landfill on Pulau Semakau's biodiversity was minimized. In fact, biodiversity remains high and we have not lost a single species because of the landfill,"" says Wang Luan Keng, an education and research officer at the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR) in Singapore. New species . She adds that as the island's various ecosystems continue to flourish, scientists are still discovering new species on Semakau. In July 2005, the government decided to open the western part of Semakau up to the public for recreational purposes. Today there are guided nature walks along the island's coast, while sports fishing and bird watching associations also organize special excursions to the island. ""When we do the tours around the island, we have a powerful message,"" says Ria Tan, an associate at the RMBR and owner of a popular Web site, wildsingapore.com. ""We tell people: 'Look how beautiful this is, and imagine what could be destroyed if the landfill had to be expanded.' This makes them think and when they go home they are more careful about how they deal with waste."" Rich biodiversity . Thus, the Semakau Landfill project has inadvertently turned into more than just a trash dump; it is becoming an educational project and could serve as a model for sustainable urban development around the world. ""The rich biodiversity around the sanitary landfill shows that development and environmental protection can co-exist and need not be mutually exclusive,"" says the NEA. ""It is of course a compromise, but in the context of urban living I think it is a good one. Some nature lovers criticize the project, but in the end we have to throw our rubbish somewhere and this is a good solution,"" says Tan. Wang agrees. ""I see Semakau Landfill as a great way of striking a balance between the need of urban development and nature conservation."" .................................

"(CNN) -- Best-selling author and director Sebastian Junger says experiencing the existence of U.S. troops' experience in Afghanistan was like being ""on Mars."" Junger documented the reality of an Army platoon as its soldiers lived, fought and died at one of the most dangerous postings in the U.S. military, a 15-man outpost called Restrepo in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley. It's the focus of Junger's new feature-length documentary, also named ""Restrepo."" The outpost, Junger told CNN's Campbell Brown in an interview Thursday night, was hellish. ""The first time I was up there we were attacked four times in one day. No running water, they didn't bathe for a month at a time. No internet, no phone, no electricity at first,"" he said. Junger said that after a few weeks at their base in Italy, the platoon's members just wanted to get back to Restrepo. ""What was going on up there was brotherhood, very different from friendship. Brotherhood, you don't even have to like the guy, but if he's your brother, you'll protect him, you'll die for him. They all felt that way."" While ""Restrepo"" is not a political film, Junger does believe NATO troops are making progress in Afghanistan, with violence in the country at a 30-year-low. ""Sixteen thousand Afghan civilians have died because of NATO combat operations in Afghanistan since 2001 -- a horrifying number, but it pales comparison to the civilian deaths in the '90s. Four hundred thousand Afghan civilians died in the '90s... The question is, does the world have the staying power to see it through.""","Author and film maker Sebastian Junger documented existence of Army platoon in Afghanistan .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican federal police have arrested a drug cartel chieftain who is a former police officer and is connected to more than 30 brutal killings, authorities said Wednesday. Miguel Ortiz Miranda, known as ""Tyson,"" was a leader for La Familia Michoacana in the city of Morelia, federal police said. Authorities consider him responsible for organizing the hit men who killed local officials as well as carrying out abductions and extortions, federal police anti-drug chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno Garcia said in a televised news conference. Ortiz, 28, was arrested Tuesday in Morelia, in Mexico's state of Michoacan. Authorities say Ortiz became involved with La Familia Michoacana in 2005 while working as a state police patrol chief. The driver of a vehicle Ortiz had stopped offered him a large amount of money to let the motorist go, Pequeno said. ""As a result of that contact, he started his illegal activities in Morelia, becoming an informant at the service of that criminal organization, reporting the movements of suspicious vehicles in the city and alerting about the presence of different police authorities, in addition to providing security to members of the criminal groups,"" Pequeno said. Police say Ortiz was involved in some of the most publicized crimes of the past year, including the June 2009 attack on a federal police convoy that killed 12 officers, and the slayings last month of 15 criminals who were acting against the wishes of La Familia Michoacana. In addition, police said, Ortiz was involved in: . -- The deaths of four police officers in a June 2009 roadside ambush. Cartel members made an anonymous phone call to federal police so they would go the scene of the purported crime and could be ambushed on the way, Ortiz told police. -- A July 2009 attempt to free Familia Michoacana leader Arnoldo Rueda Medina by attacking several federal police stations with large-caliber weapons and fragmentation grenades. -- The July 2009 execution in a Morelia home of a group of men belonging to the rival Zetas drug cartel. -- The September 2009 death of Jose Manuel Revuelta, the state's assistant secretary for public security. -- The decapitation of state official Josafat Delfino Lopez Tinoco in October 2009. Lopez's head was left in a cooler with a message from ""The Resistance"" written on a piece of cardboard. The Resistance referred to an alliance between La Familia Michoacana and several other cartels against the Zetas. -- The December 2009 attack with heavy weapons and grenades on the Hotel Casablanca in Morelia, where federal police officers were staying. -- An attempt in April on the life of Minerva Bautista Gomez, secretary for public security in Michoacan. The attack, he said, was in retaliation for changes made in the police department that hindered the cartel's interests. The hit men walked away from the shooting believing they had killed Bautista. They hadn't. Ortiz told police he participated in training by the cartel, including firearms instruction and survival lessons in the Michoacan mountains that lasted a month and were taught by former military personnel.","Miguel Ortiz Miranda is a former state police patrol leader .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- A former Argentinian dictator and an ex-army chief are scheduled to go on trial this week on charges of human rights abuses during the nation's right-wing rule from 1976-83, the government's Judicial Information Center said. Jorge Rafael Videla was among the coup leaders who overthrew then-President Isabela Martinez de Peron in March 1976. He ruled as dictator until 1981. Also scheduled to go on trial this week in a separate proceeding will be Luciano Benjamin Menendez, former head of the Third Army Corps. He is accused of violating the human rights of four people. There are 31 defendants in the two trials, the Judicial Information Center said on its website Tuesday. Another former dictator, Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone, was sentenced in April to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. He ruled Argentina from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983. Bignone, 82, faces two other trials: in the abduction and disappearance of doctors and nurses at the Hospital Posada and of two soldiers when he was head of the Military College. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the nation's eight-year ""Dirty War."" In the trials that start this week, the proceedings for Menendez are slated to begin Thursday in the city of Mendoza. Six other defendants will go on trial with him. The trial against former dictator Videla is scheduled to start Friday in Cordoba. He will be joined by 24 other defendants, the Judicial Information Center said. Videla and the others face charges related to abuses committed at a penitentiary in Cordoba and in the kidnapping and torture of six people, the information service said. Videla, 84, has previously been found guilty of other human rights abuses, including kidnapping, torture and homicide. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 but released in 1990 under a pardon issued by then-President Carlos Menem to many former members of the military dictatorship. Argentina's congress and courts have struck down the pardons and amnesty laws of the 1980s, clearing the way for rights trials to be held again.","Jorge Rafael Videla accused of kidnapping and torture .

"(CNN) -- One of two gay men recently imprisoned and pardoned in Malawi has begun a relationship with a woman, according to a group that helped provide legal support to the men. Steven Monjeza began the relationship in his hometown of Blantyre shortly after his release from prison, Dunker Kamba, administrator at the Center for the Development of People, told CNN. He was together with his former partner, Tiwonge Chimbalanga, for only one or two days after their release, he said. Monjeza and Chimbalanga were sentenced last month to 14 years in prison for gross indecency and unnatural acts, prompting an outcry from human rights and gay rights groups around the world. The president of Malawi pardoned the men after meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Authorities had arrested Monjeza and Chimbalanga in December at their home in Blantyre after the couple professed their love in a traditional engagement ceremony. Police discovered the couple when local newspapers reported on the ceremony. The criminal case against them cast light on prevailing African attitudes toward homosexuality, which is outlawed in more than 30 nations on the continent. Some in the conservative southern African nation supported the prosecution, and government officials said they were simply upholding the law. Human rights groups and advocates for gays and lesbians argued that the arrests violated Malawi's constitution, which outlaws discrimination. Monjeza and Chimbalanga are in their 20s. While they were awaiting trial, they were subjected to medical examinations intended to find evidence of sodomy, according to Human Rights Watch. They also underwent psychiatric evaluations. All the exams were done without the men's consent, the group said. CNN's Lianne Turner in London, England, contributed to this report.","One of two gay men recently pardoned is now seeing a woman, group says .

"Rio Largo, Brazil (CNN) -- Federal aid is flowing to rain-ravaged areas of northeastern Brazil and the number of missing has diminished to less than 140, but more than 150,000 people remained homeless or displaced Friday, the government said. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Friday he will not attend this weekend's G20 meeting in Canada to attend to the emergency at home, the Agencia Brasil government news outlet reported. Finance Minister Guido Mantega will take Lula's place. The death count in two hard-hit states still stood at 46 -- 29 in Alagoas state and 16 in Pernambuco, Agencia Brasil said. There were nearly 75,000 homeless or displaced residents in Alagoas and more than 80,000 in Pernambuco, the national civil defense office said. In addition, civil defense said, there were more than 19,000 homes in Alagoas that were damaged or destroyed, as were 79 bridges. In all, civil defense said on its website, 59 municipalities have been affected in Pernambuco and 28 in Alagoas. The number of missing in Alagoas, which had stood at more than 600 Thursday, dropped to 135 as residents in some flooded towns were rescued, civil defense said. The federal government announced Thursday the release of 500 million reais ($277 million) to help victims.

"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- Two fugitive brothers wanted in the much-publicized slaying of a Guatemalan lawyer last year were being held at a military base Tuesday, one day after they surrendered to authorities with a special United Nations commission, the Guatemalan Defense Ministry said. Businessmen Francisco Jose Ramon Valdes Paiz and Jose Estuardo Valdes Paiz had been sought since December on charges that they masterminded the assassination of lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg. The lawyer left behind a videotape saying that President Alvaro Colom would be responsible if anything happened to him. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known by its Spanish acronym CICIG, determined that Rosenberg orchestrated his own death in order to implicate Colom, whom he blamed for the recent slayings of two close friends. The Valdes Paiz brothers were unaware that Rosenberg duped them into carrying out his own slaying, CICIG said in January, when the commission released the results of an eight-month investigation. Rosenberg had told them told them he was being threatened by someone and wanted that person killed, the CICIG investigation concluded. Colom had nothing to do with the killing, CICIG said. The brothers' surrender came suddenly Monday morning when their lawyer called CICIG headquarters at 8 a.m. and said they wanted to turn themselves in, said Carlos Castresana, head of the U.N. agency. The brothers were in custody less than a half hour later, Castresana said at a news conference. The men chose to turn themselves in to CICIG out of concern for their personal safety, said Castresana, a Spanish judge. They were handed over to Guatemalan authorities. The brothers are being held at the Matamoros military base, said defense ministry spokesman Col. Byron Gutierrez. Rosenberg was shot from behind in May 2009 in a brazen daylight attack while riding his bicycle in Guatemala City, the nation's capital. He was shot three times in the head, once in the neck and once in the back, Castresana said in January when he presented the results of the investigation. The two brothers, who own a pharmaceutical company, had been cousins of Rosenberg through a previous marriage and did not know that he was the target of the assassination, Castresana said. Rosenberg fed information to the hit squad leader that led to his own death, giving descriptions of what the target looked like and where he would be. ""It was the two brothers and no one else,"" Castresana said. ""Not a politician. Not a [government] minister. Not a police chief. No one. Just these two brothers."" About 300 investigators from 11 nations reached their conclusion after an exhaustive examination of 100,000 telephone calls, 9,500 documents, surveillance videotapes and 135 interviews with 11 suspects and others, Castresana said. Colom had maintained since the May 10 slaying that he was innocent despite Rosenberg's explosive videotape, which was made public the day after his death. Before Monday's surrender by the brothers, Guatemalan authorities had already arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing. Arrest warrants for the brothers were issued December 10, Castresana said. Rosenberg recorded the tape blaming Colom three days before his death. He said Colom wanted him dead because the lawyer had been blaming the president and some of his top associates for the slaying of prominent businessman Khalid Musa and his daughter, Marjorie, the previous month. They were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted. Rosenberg was Musa's attorney. Castresana indicated Rosenberg staged his own killing to get back at Colom and high-level members of his government, whom he could not prove were responsible for the Musa killings. ""He wanted to open a box of lightning and thunder,"" Castresana said. Castresana pointed to several indicators of Rosenberg's state of mind: His mother had died; he was going through a second divorce, and his wife had taken their young children to Mexico; he was bereft at the slaying of Marjorie Musa, with whom he had a close relationship; and he felt a sense of powerlessness because he could not prosecute the people he believed were responsible for the Musa slayings. May 10, the date of his killing, was Mother's Day. In two April 21 e-mails, seven days after the Musa killings, Rosenberg wrote, ""I can't stop crying"" and ""I feel like I'm disintegrating,"" Castresana said. Rosenberg made out his last will and testament on April 24 and started going public with his accusations against Colom regarding the Musa slayings on May 3. On May 4, he called a meeting at his law office and said he would be leaving the firm, in which he was a partner. The next day, Castresana said, Rosenberg asked a friend to buy two cell phones anonymously. Those cell phones, the lead investigator said, were crucial to cracking the case. Rosenberg used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the Valdes Paiz brothers, who gave it to the hit squad leader. Rosenberg then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone, Castresana said. Castresana detailed how the slaying apparently was meant to be paid through a check of about $40,000. According to the investigator, Rosenberg told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from Panama that should be delivered to the Valdes Paiz brothers. The check had been made out by Luis Alejos, a Rosenberg friend and business associate who at the time was Guatemala's minister of communication, Castresana said. Alejos resigned from office in June, a few weeks after the slaying. After receiving the check, Francisco Jose Valdes Paiz destroyed it, Castresana said. The businessman paid the 300,000 quetzales ($35,900) for the assassination out of his own pocket, Castresana said. Alejos is the brother of Roberto Alejos, the president of the Guatemalan Congress, and a cousin of Gustavo Alejos, who was President Colom's private secretary at the time. In his videotape, Rosenberg said Gustavo Alejos would be among those responsible for the lawyer's death if it happened. ""If you are reading this message, it means that I, Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano, was murdered by the president's private secretary, Gustavo Alejos, and his associate Gregorio Valdez, with the approval of Mr. Alvaro Colom and [first lady] Sandra de Colom,"" Rosenberg said. After the tape surfaced, Colom went on national TV with a strong denial that he or anyone mentioned in the video was involved. He expressed his sense of vindication in a televised speech in January. ""I don't have any rancor in my heart,"" Colom said. ""Just immense gratitude for those who waited patiently with us."" The United Nations established the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala in 2006 to investigate corruption and political violence. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime, drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996. There were 6,451 slayings in Guatemala in 2009, in which only 230 verdicts were achieved, Castresana said. That means, he said, that more than 96 percent of the killings last year were not solved.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A hearing is set for Monday in a case involving actress Lindsay Lohan after an arrest warrant was issued for her Friday, officials said. A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions, police said. Lohan's attorney told CNN the warrant was issued ""out of a misunderstanding."" It was not known whether she would attend the hearing Monday. The warrant was issued by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in Beverly Hills, California. It apparently stems from Lohan's 2007 convictions for drunken driving, police said Friday. She is serving three years probation. Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office told CNN on Sunday the warrant is believed to be in connection with a possible probation violation. The district attorney's office prosecuted the original 2007 case, she said. The hearing is set to begin sometime after 8:30 a.m., she said. Lohan ""has the right to appear"" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman. ""That decision is up to her."" Lohan's attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley, told CNN on Sunday that she will appear at the hearing on Lohan's behalf. ""Since her case was resolved, Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court,"" Holley said in a statement. ""The warrant issued on Friday was, in our view, born out of a misunderstanding which I am confident I can clear up next week,"" Holley said. Police said Saturday they were not actively seeking Lohan, as they would not usually go after a person to take them into custody in such cases. Beverly Hills police Sgt. Mike Foxen said on Friday authorities were hoping Lohan would turn herself in. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on driving under the influence charges, with a cocaine possession charge in the second incident. The first arrest, in May 2007, came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehab facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police saying Lohan was trying to run her down in a car. A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later when she played both identical twins in Disney's ""The Parent Trap."" Since then, she has starred in at least a dozen movies, including ""Georgia Rule"" with Jane Fonda in 2007. Her pop music recording career, boosted by her movie roles, has floundered in the past year. Her last album was released in 2005. CNN's Irving Last contributed to this report.","Arrest warrant was issued for actress Lindsay Lohan in Beverly Hills on Friday .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Acclaimed Russian pianist Mikhail Pletnev has been charged with sexually abusing under-age children in Thailand, police said Wednesday. Pletnev was arrested and released on bail, a police official involved with the investigation told CNN. Pletnev was arrested and charged Tuesday with raping a 14-year-old boy in a Thai beach town, a crime that carries a maximum prison term of 20 years upon conviction, Thailand's official MCOT news agency reported. He was released on $9,000 bail and ordered to be back in the country by July 18, according to Itar-Tass, the official Russian news agency. Russia demanded clarification of the sex abuse charges against its Grammy-winning pianist, the state-run news agency RIA-Novosti said. ""The Russian Culture Ministry together with Russian Foreign Ministry have forwarded an urgent order to the Russian Embassy in Thailand to make all necessary efforts to clarify the situation and to offer maximum consulate protection to the distinguished musician,"" according to an online cultural ministry statement cited by RIA-Novosti. A Russian diplomat in Thailand said the pianist denied the charges, Itar-Tass said. ""He is calm and confident that everything that happens with him is a misunderstanding that would soon become clarified,"" the diplomat said. ""Pletnev has a Thai lawyer and is ready to testify in court."" Itar-Tass said the allegations against Pletnev were based on the testimony of a Thai citizen who claimed that he helped arrange Pletnev's purchase of sexual services.","Acclaimed Russian pianist Mikhail Pletnev arrested in Thailand .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Military authorities have determined that a NATO airstrike that killed 6 Afghan soldiers Wednesday in eastern Afghanistan was the result of a miscommunication between coalition and national forces. In a joint Afghan National Army (ANA) and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) statement released Wednesday afternoon, officials said the Afghan soldiers were on a planned patrol in Ghanzi province and had coordinated the location with ISAF officials, however, incorrect location coordinates were shared. ""When an ISAF helicopter patrol came across a group of individuals digging beside the road, in an area that has experienced daily IED detonations and significant casualties, ISAF patrol was cleared to engage the individuals believed to be insurgents,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Former British army officer William Shaw, who was serving a two-year sentence in Kabul's infamous Pul-e-Charki jail for bribery, has been acquitted, his daughter told CNN on Sunday. Daughter Lisa Luckyn-Malone could not provide additional information. Afghan officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Shaw, who served 28 years in the British forces, was sentenced for bribery in April -- accused of paying $25,000 to an Afghan intelligence official. Bribery under Afghan law requires the person who received the money to be a government employee. That was not the case for Shaw, according to his lawyer, Kimberly Motely. Shaw's employer, security company G4S, authorized him to pay the $25,000 in good faith as a fee to the Afghan intelligence service to have two vehicles released from their custody. That was in October 2009, and the vehicles were released. At the request of G4S, Shaw returned to the intelligence service on several occasions to ask for receipts for the cash, according to his family. Five months later, he was called in to the intelligence service for questioning and arrested. The former military serviceman who once received a top award from the Queen was sent to the Afghan super-max jail and locked up in solitary confinement. The Afghan intelligence service had sent two letters to the judges dealing with Shaw's case informing them the man who took the $25,000 from Shaw was not a government employee, according to Motely. The British Embassy in Afghanistan said it was pleased for Shaw and his family. ""We welcome the appeal court's decision which is now subject to finalization in the Supreme Court,"" an embassy spokeswoman said. ""The UK continues to strongly support the work of the Afghan government to counter corruption and reinforce the rule of law in Afghanistan.""","Shaw served 28 years in British forces .

"Washington (CNN) -- FBI Deputy Director John Pistole appears before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday for the first of two confirmation hearings to become the head of the Transportation Security Administration. The position has  been vacant since Barack Obama became president in January 2009, with an acting head  in place. Two previous Obama nominees have withdrawn from consideration due to Republican opposition and controversial issues. Pistole has been FBI deputy director since October 2004, and previously helped lead the investigation of the Egypt Air Flight 990 crash off Rhode Island in 1999. ""The talent and knowledge John has acquired in more than two decades of service with the FBI will make him a valuable asset to our administration's efforts to strengthen the security and screening measures at our airports,"" Obama said in a written statement in May when he announced the nomination. ""I am grateful that he has agreed to take on this important role, and I look forward to working with him in the weeks and months ahead."" Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano immediately endorsed Pistole, calling him uniquely qualified for the job that involves counter-terrorism efforts. ""John's national security and counterterrorism expertise will be a great asset to the Department in our efforts to enhance the security of our vital transportation systems,"" Napolitano said in a statement. Two senators involved in security issues - Republican Susan Collins of Maine and independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut - also praised Pistole as a sound choice. ""Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, he has been on the forefront of our nation's fight against terrorism,"" Collins said in a statement, while Lieberman said Pistole ""understands the threat of terrorism as well as anyone in the government."" The TSA, a part of the Department of Homeland Security, oversees national aviation safety. It has 60,000 employees, including the approximately 50,000 Transportation Security Officers who provide security at airport screening checkpoints and elsewhere. Napolitano's statement said that if confirmed by the Senate, Pistole would oversee the Homeland Security Department's ""ongoing efforts to secure the nation's aviation networks, railroads, ports and mass transit systems, security operations for 450 federalized airports throughout the nation, and the Federal Air Marshal Service."" The position has proven difficult to fill for Obama. His two previous nominees, Los Angeles Airport police department official Erroll Southers and retired Maj. Gen. Robert Harding both removed themselves from consideration for the post. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, put a hold on Southers' nomination after Southers declined to say whether he supported unionization of airport screeners. Southers eventually withdrew his name from consideration after another controversy erupted involving a decades-old personnel matter. Harding, withdrew his name from consideration in March after acknowledging that his security company overbilled the government for work performed in Iraq in 2004. At that time, the head of the 25,000-member Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Jon Adler, said the TSA ""cannot continue to operate on autopilot."" Adler said his organization fully supports Pistole's nomination. ""Since the last two nominees withdrew, we re-emphasized to Secretary Napolitano the need to select someone who combines a national law enforcement background with credible intel(ligence) experience,"" Adler said in an e-mail to CNN in May. ""We are appreciative of her responsiveness to our recommendation. Deputy Director Pistole possesses the necessary skill set to lead TSA forward from a position of strength.""","Pistole has been FBI deputy director since October 2004 .

"(CNN) -- Sylvain Chavanel reclaimed the leader's yellow jersey at the Tour de France after a bold attack in Saturday's seventh stage gave him his second victory in this year's 97th edition of cycling's premier race. The Frenchman finished the 165.5-kilometer leg from Tournus to Station des Rousses ahead of Spaniards Rafael Valls Ferri and Juan Manuel Garate, having burned the reluctant chasing pack in the hot conditions. He claimed an overall lead of one minute and 25 seconds over Cadel Evans, the runner-up in 2007 and 2008, who finished 14th in the 35-strong peloton -- who all came home 1:47 behind the Quick Step team rider. Previous leader Fabian Cancellara fell way off the pace as he finished more than 14 minutes behind Chavanel in 84th place, to be 58th overall with a deficit of 13:11. Defending champion Alberto Contador was 13th to be sixth overall, 2:27 behind Chavanel, while seven-time winner Lance Armstrong is 3:16 adrift in what is his final attempt at the race. Canada's Ryder Hesjedal moved into third place after finishing eighth, while Saxo Bank's 2009 runner-up Andy Schleck was fourth overall after coming home in 20th. Sprint points leader Thor Hushovd finished back in 179th, while his main 2009 rival Mark Cavendish could not follow up Friday's second successive stage win as he placed 161st. It was a good day for Quick Step as Jerome Pineau successfully defended his lead in the mountains classification, attacking in the opening kilometer and collecting first-place points at five of the six climbs before falling back to 44th. Pineau lead with 17km to go, but was caught by Chavanel at the foot of the final climb and the 31-year-old was not caught as the race favorites saved energy ahead of Sunday's eighth stage into the mountains at Morzine-Avoriaz. ""I began to think of the yellow jersey on the last climb, and I told myself that after having lost, it was quite a coup to take it back again,"" Chavanel, who also won a crash-marred second stage, told the Tour de France website. ""Tomorrow I will do everything to defend it, but I know that the battle will mainly concern Contador, Schleck and Evans. In the midst of it, I'll always give everything but if I lose it does not matter. ""Right now I'm on my little cloud, I'm floating and I don't know how else to describe it. But I see that I have great support on the road and everywhere. It warms my heart."" Evans said he was happy to let Quick Step attack ahead of a testing stage on Sunday. ""Tomorrow is the first day with really big climbs and another mountain-top finish,"" he said. ""It'll be another day where the main contenders look at each other, test themselves and we'll see if someone really wants to lay it on the line and blow it apart -- for someone like Alberto or Lance, it's probably in their interests to try and do that.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- On the second day of Manuel Noriega's money-laundering trial, the former Panamanian dictator told a French court late Tuesday that he had a once-strong relationship with the United States. ""I received high praise from the U.S., Interpol and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs,"" Noriega said. Testifying in Spanish -- and standing for a total of five hours with only two five-minute breaks -- he added, ""I was especially in contact with the CIA,"" describing himself as a ""mediator."" Noriega was extradited from the United States to France in April to face charges that he laundered drug-trafficking profits of 15 million French francs, or 2.3 million euros (U.S. $2.8 million). He denies the charges, and claimed Tuesday he had documents proving that he was the victim of a conspiracy. His trial is expected to close Wednesday. Wearing a black suit, a gray tie and a red pocket handkerchief, Noriega presented reasons for the numerous bank transactions and cash deposits he had made throughout Paris in 1988 and 1989. When Judge Agnes Quantin began to press him over specific dates of certain transactions, he simply replied, ""I don't know"" or ""I don't remember."" And after being asked to review his career, he often got dates confused and had to be prompted by his lawyers. The review lasted roughly one hour. The lawyers, Olivier Metzner and Yves Leberquier, told reporters in front of the court Monday that Noriega had always disclosed where his money came from. His lawyers repeatedly emphasized that Noriega had been awarded the Legion d'honneur, a highly prestigious award in France that is given to individuals with outstanding civilian or military achievement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April after he spent more than 20 years in a U.S. federal prison. Noriega and his attorneys had argued that the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989. U.S. federal courts ruled against him. U.S. forces removed the ex-dictator from office during Operation Nifty Package, the 1989 invasion of Panama.  Noriega had fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound, blaring music at all hours, a psychological ploy to rattle the general. He eventually surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial. After his drug conviction, Noriega was given POW status. His federal sentence, originally for 30 years, ended in September 2007 after time off for good behavior. In Panama, Noriega is wanted for the murder of a political rival. Panama has requested his extradition, but the United States honored France's extradition request instead. France has already convicted Noriega in absentia for money laundering but then promised him a new trial. Panama also has convicted him in absentia and has said he would get a new trial. While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","Noriega: I had a once-strong relationship with the U.S.

"Washington (CNN) -- Actor Laurence Fishburne is visibly moved when asked to read an excerpt of remarks made more than a half-century ago by the man he now portrays onstage, the legendary Thurgood Marshall. The NAACP attorney was arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1958 over whether Little Rock, Arkansas, officials essentially had to follow the order of the courts to desegregate its schools. Marshall, a sharp lawyer, turned the tables on the all-white bench, making the issue not about black students seeking equality but about society's larger civic responsibilities. ""Education is not the teaching of the three Rs. Education is the teaching of the overall citizenship. To learn to live together with fellow citizens, and above all, to learn to obey the law,"" Marshall told the court. ""I worry about the white children in Little Rock who are told as young people that the way to get your rights is to violate the law and defy the lawful authorities. I am worried about their future. I don't worry about those Negro kids' future. They've been struggling with democracy long enough, they know about it."" Fishburne commands the stage as the first African-American on the Supreme Court in a new one-man play ""Thurgood"" for a one-month engagement at the Kennedy Center in Washington. ""Powerful stuff,"" he said about hearing Marshall's own words in the rarely heard audio argument of Cooper v. Aaron. The 48-year-old actor thoroughly researched this role, but he was unaware of this all-but forgotten chapter in Marshall's colorful life. ""Before I read the script for 'Thurgood', I knew nothing about Thurgood Marshall,"" he said, sitting comfortably in a lounge just off the Eisenhower Theater. ""He was a very, very funny man. He was also a very serious man when it came time to be serious. I think he understood there was a time and a place for all kinds of behavior from human beings, and he indulged in those things at the appropriate times,"" laughing loudly. It takes a good man with an unwavering dose of self-confidence to stand alone on a stage for 90 minutes straight, and portray a giant of American history. Fishburne offers a little secret to making it work. ""The wonderful thing about this piece even though it's a one-man show, I have a scene partner. My scene partner is the audience,"" he said. ""So that makes it really important for me to be paying attention and seeing how people respond."" Fishburne has won a Tony, an Emmy and was nominated for an Academy Award. The actor currently stars as a forensic investigator in ""CSI"" on CBS. He first did the role of Marshall on Broadway two years ago. After this Washington engagement, he takes ""Thurgood"" to Los Angeles and the Geffen Playhouse. The creator of the show is George Stevens Jr., who wanted to have Marshall ""make the case for himself,"" with just one actor onstage. ""One-hundred years after the end of slavery in the 1950s, he comes around and lives in a segregated society where people can't go to lunch counters, schools, swimming pools, all of that discrimination, housing,"" Stevens said. ""And decides that you can use the law to change it. And that was such an act of imagination. And that gives purpose to the play, but it is his sense of humor. His sense of narrative throughout his life; Marshall was a storyteller. And that gives us so much to work with."" An example in the play has Fishburne as Marshall talking to his critics in the 1980s who thought he should leave the bench. ""They said I was too old, too liberal, too tipsy,"" says the character. ""I'd tell them, I accepted a lifetime appointment. I'm staying for life. I expect to die at the age of 110. Shot by a jealous husband!"" which prompts huge laughter. The play recounts through stories and anecdotes the remarkable journey of Marshall, who was born in 1908 and grew up in segregated Baltimore, Maryland. He was rejected from the University of Maryland law school because he was black, but after graduating from Howard University at the head of his class, he became chief counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and won 29 of 32 cases argued before the high court. He later joined that bench in 1967, retiring in 1991. He died in 1993. Marshall was in the news recently when President Barack Obama nominated the justice's former law clerk Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. Kagan recalled Marshall playfully called her ""Shorty"" during her 1988-89 clerkship. Fishburne was not the first choice to play the role. Stevens had produced a 1991 television miniseries based on the landmark Brown v. Board case that ended public segregation. Marshall was played then by Sidney Poitier, who backed out of the current project. So did actor James Earl Jones. But Stevens and director Leonard Foglia saw something in Fishburne. ""He's a compelling actor. And he's of an age which I originally thought was perhaps too young to do this part,"" said Stevens. ""But I learned the opposite -- he can come out as the older Thurgood Marshall. And when he goes back in memory to his younger days, he has the vitality that brings that alive. So he's just a wonderful choice for this role."" Dressed in comfortable red sneakers, light khakis and a casual blue shirt, Fishburne said the role is one of the greatest acting challenges he has ever faced. ""It's all there,"" he said of Marshall, whom he never met. ""I mean, we deal with his flaws and we deal with his strengths, we deal with his history, we deal with his disappointments as well as his victories. So, it's all there. It's all there in the show. Warts and all."" The actor said it helped that Marshall was a master storyteller, who combined wit with a touch of lingering bitterness over how he was treated as a black man. The story Stevens and Fishburne weave is more than a history lesson about race, but both men said Marshall's humanity makes it instantly relatable to a wide audience. ""It is a uniquely American life,"" Fishburne said. ""The last thing that he says in the play, he quotes [poet] Langston Hughes, and he says 'America will be.' This is a work in progress, that this is the great experiment. And it is. And that we all have a stake in it. That we are all sort of in a way responsible for realizing it. Whether we accept that responsibility or not, the fact of the matter is we're all here together.""","Laurence Fishburne portrays Thurgood Marshall in one-man play in Washington .

"(CNN) -- Psychic or just plain phony? If there was any reason to believe that a crystal ball is hiding in that bulbous head of Paul the octopus, be warned: This article might just disappoint. Ready? Some marine biologists and experts say it's more than likely that Paul doesn't have the gift of prophecy after all. What's more likely is that he's learned to recognize the German flag. The 2-year-old octopus, who was born in England and now lives in a German aquarium, has become a World Cup phenomenon after correctly predicting the winners in all six of the German national team's matches. ""He has a run that many gamblers will only ever dream of,"" said Tony LaCasse, a spokesman for the New England Aquarium. ""Paul is running a remarkable series of picks, but I honestly doubt that he has extrasensory abilities."" During each prediction, two mussel-filled acrylic boxes labeled with a team's flag are lowered into his tank. Whichever box he chooses conveys the winning team. The eight-tentacled oracle has been relatively consistent, plopping himself over the German box in his first few predictions. But he drew cries of despair from assembled watchers before the semifinal round, when he lingered over the box for the German flag before opting for the Spanish flag instead. Spain won the match 1-0. For the final game of the World Cup, Paul picked Spain, again, to win against the Netherlands. Octopi are among the most intelligent sea creatures in the world, said Mike Henley, an animal keeper at the Smithsonian National Zoo. Being keen learners and natural hunters, they quickly figure out how to maneuver and finagle objects in the wild in order to sustain themselves. Yet when kept in captivity, as Paul has been, they must often be trained to accept prepared food, Henley said. LaCasse said that at the New England Aquarium, which has a giant Pacific octopus, marine biologists usually give the animals Plexiglas boxes with different latches, lids and arrangements to see if they are able to retrieve their food. And it's this ability to pick things up quickly that might explain why Paul is consistently picking the winning team. ""Looking at the series of predictions, it appears that this may have been a learned task,"" said Dr. Jean Boal, a marine biology professor at Millersville University in Pennsylvania. Boal, who has worked with cephalopods for more than 20 years, believes that Paul's first pick may have just been pure luck and that he has been picking the German flag since his Euro 2008 days because the sea creature has learned to do so. ""It's a simple form of conceptual learning,"" she said. By recognizing shapes and patterns, octopi will learn to gravitate toward them and even pick up skills, such as opening a jar or a box, that will lead them a food treat. ""They are very attentive to people. It's possible to train them, even unwittingly,"" Boal said. But what about the times that he didn't pick the German flag? Part of their learning process, Boal said, is that ""once in a while, they might choose something else."" Then what about the red and yellow in the German and Spanish flags that Paul has been consistently attracted to? There's no truth in that either, experts say. While octopi have excellent eyesight, they're colorblind. ""They don't have color vision, but they are able to see different shades of gray,"" said Richard Learner, curator of fishes at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland. ""If anything, you have to factor distance and his trained abilities into this whole mystery of Paul's psychic powers."" Paul's trainer, Oliver Walenciak, could not be immediately reached for comment. Henley, the Smithsonian Zoo animal keeper, said that fans will have to wait until Sunday to see whether the octopus will be able to prove to the world his powers. ""It'll be amazing to see what he does next,"" Henley said. ""He's just gotten lucky every time. We should take him to Vegas.""","Experts say Paul the octopus has simply learned to recognize the German flag .
Octopi are highly intelligent and can recognize shapes, patterns and even people .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said Monday that federal officials are ""gathering up facts"" to help ensure that embattled oil giant BP fairly compensates people and businesses suffering losses. Speaking at a Coast Guard staging facility in Theodore, Alabama, Obama said he hopes to hammer out with top BP officials Wednesday a new structure for processing claims so that they ""are dealt with justly, fairly, promptly."" He said preliminary talks on the restructuring have already begun, but was cautious about how much progress can be made before Wednesday's meeting. He said that cleanup and containment of the spill won't happen overnight. ""It's going to take time for things to return to normal."" ""There's going to be a harmful effect on many local businesses and it's going to be painful for a lot of folks,"" he said. Obama also announced an effort to ensure that seafood from the Gulf of Mexico remains safe to eat. Under the new comprehensive seafood initiative, federal authorities will increase inspections of seafood processors, strengthen surveillance programs and monitor fish caught outside restricted waters, Obama said. ""Seafood from the Gulf today is safe to eat, but we need to make sure that it stays that way,"" he said. The president arrived in Gulfport, Mississippi, earlier in the day -- his first stop on a two-day tour of the states, including Alabama and Florida, most affected by the oil disaster. This is his fourth trip to the Gulf Coast since the oil began to gush nearly two months ago, though previous trips were limited to Louisiana. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the administration's point person in the region, briefed Obama shortly after his arrival. At the end of the briefing, Obama encouraged tourists to not cancel plans to vacation in the region. ""There's still a lot of opportunity for visitors to come down here -- a lot of beaches that are not yet affected or will not be affected,"" Obama said. ""One of the best ways to help is to come down here and enjoy the outstanding hospitality,"" the president said. The president, who canceled a trip to Indonesia and Australia, has faced criticism that he hasn't been fully engaged in the crisis. Gulf Coast resident Jim Hall said he is ready to see more action and less talking from the administration. ""Looking at the overall picture, I wish he would take more assertive power in what's going on as far as protection of our environment. My property values have probably dropped 30 percent, 40 percent in the last 50 days,"" said Hall, who has lived and fished on the Gulf since the '80s. ""I know all about the claims and I know all about the payment back, but I just wish the government would become a little bit more active in taking care of we, the voters,"" he said. Harry Jemison, owner of Jemison's Bait-N-Tackle shop, said his business was on course for a record year, but after the oil spill, everyone is ""afraid to fish."" Obama acknowledged the toll of the massive oil spill. ""There's a sense that this disaster is not only threatening our fishermen and our shrimpers and oystermen, not only affecting precious marshes and wetlands and estuaries ... there's also a fear that it could have a long-term impact on a way of life that has been passed on for generations,"" Obama said. ""We are absolutely committed to working with [local and state officials] to do everything in our power to protect the Gulf Coast way of life so that it's there for our children, our grandchildren and our great grandchildren,"" he said. Following his visit to the Gulf Coast, Obama will update the nation about the situation in a prime time address from the Oval Office. Obama will talk about the oil-leak containment strategy, the reorganization of minerals management at the Department of the Interior and the beginning of a process to restore the Gulf to a place better than it was before the Deepwater Horizon exploded, a senior administration official said. BP has until midnight to present a new plan to the White House for containing the oil. Obama is scheduled to meet with BP executives in person at the White House on Wednesday. The president plans to push BP to create a BP-funded escrow account that will pay for damage claims from the oil spill, said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama. In addition, Axelrod said, the plan would call for an independent third party to handle the claims process. ""The president will use every legal device at his disposal to make sure that this money is escrowed and that there is an independent administrator so that claims are not slow-walked, people can get the relief they need in a timely fashion and that we don't create more victims from this terrible disaster,"" Axelrod said. CNN's Ed Hornick, Kristi Keck, Dan Lothian and Xuan Thai contributed to this report.","NEW: President gets briefing from Coast Guard admiral, urges Gulf Coast tourism .

"(CNN) -- The group of Hungarian teens and young adults had traveled to the United States to experience American culture during a three-week trip of hiking excursions, overnight retreats, home-stays and tourist stops. Now, the group will return home without two of its members, carrying memories of the tragic boating accident that took their lives. The bodies of Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs Prem, 20, were recovered from the site of the boating accident in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Friday and identified later in the day, according to authorities. The discoveries came two days after a tour boat the group was on collided with a barge in the Delaware River. Rescuers saved 35 people on the tour boat, popularly known as a duck boat, an amphibious vehicle that takes passengers on land and sea to major destinations on Philadelphia's tourist track. Among those rescued were some of the Hungarians and their hosts from Marshallton United Methodist Church of West Chester, Pennsylvania. Schwendtner and Prem were missing for more than two days before their fate was confirmed. The 15 Hungarians arrived in the United States on July 2 on a cultural exchange program organized by Atlantic Bridge, a Netherlands-based group that describes itself as ""a Christian, international, cross-cultural team with a passion for young people."" The team of Hungarian ""BridgeBuilders"" came from Mosonmagyarovar, a town in northwest Hungary known for its hot baths and large number of dentists, drawing Austrians from across the border in search of cheap dental work, according to Atlantic Bridge's website. The leaders of Atlantic Bridge did not respond to e-mails for comment Friday night, but the group's website provides a loose timeline of the youths' travels. Representatives from Marshallton United Methodist Church did not return requests for comment Friday night. After the youths arrived in New York they spent the Fourth of July weekend visiting ground zero, Central Park and Chinatown, and celebrating the nation's birthday with host families, Atlantic Bridge's director, John Oostdyk, wrote on the organization's website. On July 6, they set out in five cars to West Chester, Pennsylvania, to meet their hosts from the Marshallton United Methodist Church for the next leg of their trip. Marshallton sent a youth group to Hungary through Atlantic Bridge in 2006, and a team from Hungary first came in 2007, the church said on its website. ""Together the two youth groups share in Christian fellowship and fun, while the visitors stay with host families, and enjoy tours to various cultural and historic places in their respective countries,"" a statement said. The next day, seven members of the church accompanied their Hungarian counterparts on a trip to Philadelphia, where they boarded the ""Ride the Ducks"" tour boat at Penn's Landing. The boat had mechanical trouble and the engine shut down after a fire onboard, Lt. Frank Vanore of the Philadelphia Police Department said Wednesday. While the boat was waiting for help in the river, the barge hit it, Vanore said. The boat overturned and passengers were spilled into the river. ""When I saw the picture I realized how true it was when someone earlier said 'it is a miracle anyone survived this,' "" Oostdyk said on Atlantic Bridge's website. ""Ride the Ducks"" voluntarily shut down operations at all its locations across the country, and the NTSB is investigating the incident. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with our Philadelphia tour guests, crew members and their families. We are attending to their needs first,"" the company said on its website. After the passengers were brought to land, a count was taken and it was discovered that Schwendtner and Prem were missing, the church said. The group went back to Marshallton, where they were looked after by the Rev. Scott Widmer, the church's pastor, and members of the congregation and community. ""The church is continuing to provide comfort, prayer, pastoral care and sanctuary for the spiritual needs of the youth groups in the midst of their shock and grief,"" Marshallton said on its website. The Hungarian youths are still in Pennsylvania, according to an employee in Atlantic Bridge's Netherlands office, but it was unclear whether they would stay until their scheduled return on July 23. On Wednesday, Oostdyk flew to the United States to be with the group. On Thursday, prayer vigils were held at two United Methodist churches in the region, drawing attendees from churches and communities throughout the area. ""It was a world of grief, but also a world of compassion and prayer and of gathering around the team of Hungarian students who had seen their summer of high expectations destroyed in a matter of minutes just 24 hours earlier,"" Oostdyk said.","Bodies of Dora Schwendtner, Szabolcs Prem, found near site of Pennsylvania boating accident .

"Port St. Joe, Florida (CNN) -- One by one, with a hand as steady as a surgeon's, Lorna Patrick removes eggs from a sea turtle's nest on a Florida beach. ""If it falls, you probably killed the hatchling that's developing inside,"" said Patrick, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Patrick admits she holds her breath each time she takes an egg out of the sand and places it in the foam cooler. Sand is delicately placed in the cooler between and on top of each egg. Patrick uses the sand from the nest, which is located just a few inches from the beach's surface. This process is part of an unprecedented sea turtle relocation program. Moving sea turtle nests days before the eggs are to hatch has never been done before. It is also the first time that wildlife experts had to deal with oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. ""Shy of letting the hatchlings swim in oil, it's our best alternative,"" said Sandy MacPherson, the national sea turtle coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ""We're confident if they go into oil they're going to die."" Patrick is working on the second sea turtle nest to be moved since the program started. Ninety percent of the United States' sea turtle population can be found on Florida's beaches, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is estimated that 700 nests can be found in the Florida Panhandle, an area vulnerable to the oil spill. ""This is a huge relocation effort,"" said Thomas Strickland, assistant secretary of interior for fish and wildlife and parks. ""As many as 50 to 100,000 eggs over the next six to eight weeks will be dug up."" An average nest has anywhere from 100 to 120 eggs. Sea turtles come out of the water a few feet from the coastline and lay their eggs in the warm sand. Loggerhead turtle eggs, the type Patrick is handling, usually hatch within 60 to 70 days. The eggs are moved just over a week before they are expected to hatch. Wildlife officials want to keep the eggs in their natural environment as long as possible. ""Through the eggs it's believed they actually connect to the landscapes where they were born,"" Strickland said. Once the turtles mature it is hoped that they will return to the original nesting area and the natural birthing cycle will continue. Once Patrick's two coolers are full, with the nest's 107 eggs, they will start a journey across the state. A special climate-controlled truck donated by Federal Express will deliver the eggs to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The coolers will be stored in a special NASA building that will be regulated to the warm summer temperatures to which the eggs are accustomed. Instead of the beautiful white sandy beach, the hatchlings will be born in the transport coolers. Once they break out of their shells, the warm blue Atlantic Ocean will be awaiting them.","U.S. wildlife experts are moving sea turtle eggs by hand to save them from the oil disaster .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- As oil again again flows freely, crews are working around the clock to replace a containment cap on the ruptured underwater well in the Gulf of Mexico, BP said Saturday. The company hopes to install a better-fitting one in the coming days, BP senior Vice President Kent Wells said. ""We're on plan,"" he said hours after the old cap was removed. Live video showed robots in the process of removing six bolts from the apparatus so that the new cap can be positioned. The bolts may all be removed by Sunday. The old cap had been diverting about 15,000 barrels a day (630,000 gallons) to a ship. BP still is recovering an additional 8,000 to 9,000 barrels a day (336,000 to 378,000 gallons) through a line connected to another vessel, the Q4000. Wells said the sealing cap operation is expected to take four to seven days, with favorable weather helping the process along. In upcoming weeks, there will be an increase in the current oil containment work. A fleet of skimmers will help recover the oil now making its way to the surface. ""As we start to ramp up the additional containment capacity, we should see less and less flow,"" Wells said. Wells said crews are in the final stages of hooking up the Helix Producer, another oil recovery vessel, to the well. The vessel is expected to begin collecting oil by Sunday and officials hope to reach full collection capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels (840,000 to 1.5 million gallons) per day within three days. ""We're in the final stages in doing the pressure testing"" on the Helix Producer, Wells said. If successful, the effects of the containment cap operation could halt the oil gusher that started April 20 after a deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Officials have said such a fix would be temporary, and the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well. There are two relief wells under construction, with one expected to be completed in August. One could intercept the leaking well as early as the end of July. Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels (2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons) a day should be contained, Wells said. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from BP's breached Macondo well. The company also says the sealing cap work ""is intended to run in parallel with the installation and start-up of the Helix Producer."" BP says there will be a period of decreased oil and gas capture from the wellhead during the cap replacement. It said another recovery vessel, the Q4000, ""should continue to capture and flare oil and gas.""  There will be other recovery vessels and skimmers deployed. ""This can be done very effectively,"" Wells said. Wells also said there will be ""significant measurement capability"" added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate. BP said in a statement that the new cap ""should improve containment efficiency during hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnect and reconnect times."" Wells echoed much of what retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Friday. Allen said he approved the cap-switch plan in order to take advantage of favorable weather predicted for coming days and because, once the switch is complete, the resulting capacity to contain oil ""will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems."" Allen stressed that once the capping device is on, ""we would get the most accurate flow rate to date,"" he said. Meanwhile, Allen on Saturday announced that Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft is scheduled to relieve Rear Adm. James Watson as the federal on-scene coordinator Monday. Zukunft, who has been in the region for several weeks overseeing strategic planning, is the Coast Guard's assistant commandant for marine safety, security and stewardship. Watson will return to his previous duties. CNN's Sanjay Gupta, Vivian Kuo and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report .","NEW: Replacement process is ""on plan,"" BP official says .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners and supporters crowded hillsides near Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sunday, to mark the 15th anniversary of the massacre of nearly 8,000 men and boys. More than 50,000 people witnessed the burial of 775 newly identified genocide victims at the Centre Potocari -- the official Srebrenica Genocide Memorial where 5,000 genocide victims are buried -- a few miles outside the city, according to Bosnia-Herzegovina's official news agency, Fena. In 1995, Potocari served as a safe-haven for Bosnian Muslims. They were under the protection of a U.N.-Dutch-led mission. The massacre of men and boys occurred when ethnic Serb troops overran the United Nations safe area. The five-day slaughter was the worst European massacre since World War II and was described by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal as ""the triumph of evil."" Witnesses, human rights investigators and court testimonies documented the summary executions, as well the rape and murder of women. Sunday's burial was attended by top international officials, including a U.S. delegation whose members read a statement from President Barack Obama. In the statement, Obama called the Srebrenica massacre an ""unimaginable"" tragedy that has left an indelible ""stain on our collective conscience."" ""Fifteen years ago today, despite decades of pledges of 'never again,' 8,000 men and boys were murdered in these fields and hills,"" said in the statement. ""They were brothers, sons, husbands, and fathers, and they all became victims of genocide."" Obama also called on all governments to ""redouble their efforts"" to find and prosecute those responsible for the tragedy. ""This includes Ratko Mladic, who presided over the killings and remains at large,"" he said, referring to the former Bosnian Serb army commander. Mladic has been charged with genocide and remains a fugitive. Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic is now on trial at the tribunal in The Hague. Fena news agency reported that Boris Tadic, president of Serbia, also attended the burial memorial of the genocide victims and promised to find Serb war criminals. ""I, as the president of Serbia, will never give up finding them, and especially Ratko Mladic. When that ends, I will consider a part of my job completed,"" Tadic said. ""But before that, it is important that people reach out to one another and to continue living as people. A lot of time has passed, and I have done everything possible for Mladic to be arrested,"" he said.","Obama: Massacre leaves ""stain on our collective conscience""

"(CNN) -- A new audio recording released online Monday purportedly captures another profanity-laced argument between actor Mel Gibson and former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, in which he threatens her life and verbally abuses her. RadarOnline released the audio on its website Monday -- the second such recording since another tirade was posted Friday. The site claims the male voice is that of the 54-year-old Gibson. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the recording. In the audio released Monday, the man on the recording can be heard repeatedly using sexual slurs and profane insults as he grows increasingly enraged throughout the phone conversation. At one point, the man says, ""What, what are you threatening me?"" after the woman tells him he is ""going to answer"" for an alleged physical assault against her in which her teeth were broken. ""I'll threaten,"" the man says. ""I'll put you in the f***ing rose garden."" The man also says of the alleged assault: ""You got what you f***ing deserved."" In the recording released Friday, the man launches into a racist, sexist rant against the woman, telling her she looks ""like a f***ing b**** on heat and if you get raped by a pack of n***ers it will be your fault."" It's unclear when either audio recording was captured. Grigorieva, 40, said the female voice on the recordings is hers and that the other voice is Gibson's. CNN's efforts to obtain comment from Gibson have been unsuccessful. Gibson's longtime publicist, Alan Nierob, said Friday, ""We can't comment due to legal nature of the matter."" Also Friday, the William Morris Endeavor talent agency confirmed to CNN that Gibson is no longer their client. Gibson has been caught in a custody dispute with Grigorieva over the couple's 8-month-old daughter. Last week, the Malibu Hills Police Department opened an investigation into an alleged domestic violence dispute between Gibson and Grigorieva. Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that the actor and director struck her in the face, according to her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. Police said last week that they are still in the process of gathering information surrounding Grigorieva's allegations. Grigorieva has spoken with sheriff's deputies and has provided a statement to them in their domestic violence investigation, Jaffe told CNN Friday. The publicist said Grigorieva did not initiate the investigation. The recordings ""will be part of the investigation,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said on Monday. It is not known how RadarOnline obtained the recordings. Jaffe said Friday that the site did not receive them from Grigorieva. She ""absolutely did not provide any tape to the media,"" he said. Gibson came under fire for a racially charged tirade in 2006, when he admitted to making anti-Semitic remarks during a drunken driving arrest. He issued an apology at the time, and appealed to the Jewish community to help him recover from his alcohol addiction.","Recording purportedly captures fight between actor and ex-girlfriend .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Facing political pressure, Madhav Kumar Nepal announced Wednesday that he is resigning as Nepal's prime minister. In a 20-minute televised address, Nepal said he wanted to avert crisis and find ""political resolution to the peace process and the drafting of the new constitution."" ""Since it is not right to keep the country in a state of indecision and uncertainty, despite having a clear majority in parliament, I have decided to resign today so that the peace process and the constitution drafting process are completed,"" he said. Nepal has endured a fractious political transition since it was declared a republic in 2008 after the abolition of a centuries-old monarchy. This is the third government that has fallen since then. The opposition Maoists, who form the largest party in parliament, have demanded Nepal's resignation as the troubled Himalayan nation prepares a new constitution. Otherwise, the Maoists had threatened to disrupt the parliamentary session and block approval of the annual budget. The failure to adopt a new constitution by the late May deadline would have automatically dissolved the government. But the Maoists agreed to let the government amend the constitution and extend the deadline by a year. In exchange, the Maoists wanted the prime minister to step down so they could lead the government again. The Maoists fought a decade-long insurgency in an effort to topple Nepal's monarchy, leaving more than 13,000 people dead. They signed a peace deal in 2006. Elections in April 2008 made Nepal a republic and dethroned the king. The Maoists were the largest party in the previous coalition government, but their leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- commonly known as Prachanda -- resigned as prime minister a year ago because the president overturned his decision to fire a senrio military official. The Maoists declined to join the next coalition government under Nepal's leadership, upset that the government was not making moves to integrate about 19,000 former rebels into the Nepalese army. The government has been reluctant to integrate its former enemies. It's unclear who will succeed Nepal as the next prime minister. Journalist Manesh Shrestha contributed to this report.","Madhav Kumar Nepal announced he was quitting in a televised address .

"(CNN) -- A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for a trio of bombings that killed at least 74 people Sunday at two venues in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where crowds had gathered to watch the World Cup final. ""And the best of men have promised and they have delivered,"" said an Arabic statement issued by Al-Shabaab's press office and obtained by CNN. ""Blessed and exalted among men -- (taking) full responsibility. ...We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators; they have received their response."" The 6,000 is an apparent reference to African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. Uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort. ""We are behind the attack because we are at war with them,"" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. ""We had given warning to the Ugandans to refrain from their involvement in our country. We spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us."" Rage said young suicide bombers carried out the attacks but did not specify their nationalities. ""May Allah accept these martyrs who carried out the blessed operation and exploded themselves in the middle of the infidels,"" he said. However, Police Chief Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura told reporters arrests have been made in connection with the bombings. He would not say how many people have been arrested or provide details. Earlier Monday, Sheikh Abu Al Zubeir, identified as ""the emir of Al-Shabaab in Somalia,"" said in an Arabic website posting, ""My message to the Ugandan and Burundian nations is that you will be the target for our retribution to the massacres perpetrated against the Somali men, women and children in Mogadishu by your forces."" The statement was posted on an al Qaeda affiliated website that previously has carried statements and videos from Al-Shabaab. The website set up a page Monday to ""receive congratulations"" on Al-Shabaab's behalf for the ""blessed operations"" in Uganda. Suspicion had centered on Somali Islamist groups shortly after the explosions in Kampala. Islamic militants battling Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government had previously threatened attacks on Uganda and Burundi. The U.N. Security Council said of the attacks in a statement Monday: . ""The members of the Security Council reaffirm that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of its motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed, and further reaffirm the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts."" Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared a week of national mourning for victims of the bombings, beginning Tuesday, according to a government statement. All flags on public buildings will be lowered to half-staff during the mourning period, the statement said. Eighty-five people were injured in the Ugandan blasts, Kayihura told reporters. They were transferred from the national hospital to a privately owned hospital in Kampala, he said. U.S.  officials said five Americans were among the wounded. ""This incident shows that it was terrorism,"" he said. Kayihura said he could not confirm that Al-Shabaab was responsible, but said the nature of the explosives used were consistent with the group. Police are using forensics to analyze the explosives, he said, and will deliver a report in a day or two. The 74 fatalities included 28 Ugandans, one Irish citizen, one Indian, one American and 11 people who are either Ethiopian or Eritrean, according to the Ugandan government. ""If you want to fight, why don't you attack soldiers or military installations instead of fighting innocent people watching football?"" said Museveni, who on Monday visited a rugby sports center where two of the blasts occurred Sunday. The blasts hit within 50 minutes of each other. The first one struck an Ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among expatriates. Two others exploded at the rugby center. A senior Ugandan government official confirmed there were three bombs. The second one at the rugby club was the most severe, said the official, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media due to the sensitivity of the situation. The U.S. Embassy confirmed the death of one American. An organization that works with children in Uganda identified him as Nate Henn. In a post on its website, the organization Invisible Children said Henn was in the country working with Ugandan students. CNN could not independently verify the information. ""Nate was not a glory-seeker and never sought the spotlight. He asked not to be made a hero of,"" the post said. ""But the life he lived inspires reflection and imitation."" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said five other Americans were hospitalized, and that two of them ""have serious injuries requiring significant medical attention."" The State Department is assisting in their medical evacuation, he said. Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said President Barack Obama is ""deeply saddened by the loss of life resulting from these deplorable and cowardly attacks."" Obama called Museveni on Monday morning and offered to provide support and assistance, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. ""I'm told the FBI will assist in the investigation of the bombings."" Crowley said a three-person FBI team is on the ground collecting evidence, with another team standing by ready to assist. Two diplomatic security officers also were en route to Uganda. He added the State Department has no reason to doubt Al-Shabaab's claim of responsibility, saying the ""evidence so far at the attack scene would suggest an Al-Shabaab connection."" Museveni said, ""We wish to condemn the criminality of these attacks. From a casual look at the scene, I'm confident police will be able to reconstruct the crime scene. ... We shall go after them because we know where they come from."" The bombings, he said, show ""criminality and terrorism has always been hovering over us."" In a government statement, Somali President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said he ""condemns in the strongest terms the despicable terrorist acts that killed over 60 people in Kampala."" ""The fact that the victims were enjoying the World Cup reveals the evil and ugly nature of the perpetrators and the need to uproot from [the] region those who do not value the sanctity of human life,"" the statement said. ""The president also denounces the fringe Al-Shabaab terrorist groups [that] rejoice of the carnage and stated that Somalia mourns with the brotherly people of Uganda."" Stone Atwine was watching the game at the rugby center when the blast occurred. ""It happened toward the 90th minute of the game ... this loud explosion,"" he said. ""We didn't know what was happening, we were running around, scampering for safety. I saw dead guys still seated in their chairs with blood."" Atwine said a second explosion struck the venue seconds later, knocking out power. ""At that point, we ran off. My friends and I ran into the car and drove off."" Relatives flocked to hospitals and mortuaries to look for loved ones Monday. ""I was watching the game with my brother at the rugby center,"" said Ian Lule, who was among a group gathered at a city hospital. ""The blast left him unconscious. I don't know how he is."" In the capital, crowds huddled around newspapers, talking in hushed tones. ""Everyone is shocked, everyone is talking about it,"" said Mark Keith Muhumuza, who was watching the game at a stadium near the rubgy center explosion. ""We were in panic mode at the stadium because we thought we would be attacked next."" Muhumuza said when the game ended, he went to the rugby center. ""People were wailing, some were trying to find their relatives, others were trying to run away from the scene."" ""You can never stop attacks in the world,"" said FIFA President Sepp Blatter. ""During the World Cup, the world should have been touched by the emotions of football. I'm very sad and I was very touched."" ""I deplore what has happened and look forward to the good that football can bring to our world."" The sites of the bombings remained cordoned off as authorities intensified security in the east African nation. Police and military forces patrolled the capital. Some of the injured at the restaurant included six members of an American church mission working with a local congregation, according to the Rev. Kathleen Kind, pastor of Christ Community United Methodist Church in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. All the church members were accounted for and families had been contacted, Kind said. Their injuries ranged from broken bones and flesh wounds to temporary blindness and hearing problems, she said. Kayihura said the bombings could have been avoided if the two venues had used security measures such as metal detectors and guards. The African Union summit is scheduled to be held in Kampala next week.

"Washington (CNN) -- The top U.S. military officer is reassuring his Pakistani counterpart that the U.S. military is not pressuring the Pakistani army to increase its operations against the Taliban there, a senior U.S. military official said. The message comes as the United States has turned up independent evidence that ties the suspect in the attempted bombing in New York's Times Square to the insurgent group. It stands in sharp contrast to tough talk from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who warned of ""consequences"" if the Times Square plot is linked to elements in Pakistan. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, chief of the Pakistani army, to discuss the matter Sunday. Mullen called to ""reassure Kayani we are not trying to pressure him as a result of this case,"" a senior U.S. military official said. ""Mullen didn't call to say, 'You gotta do more because this Pakistani-American was trained on your territory.' "" Gen. Stanley McChrystal, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, met with Kayani as well, and his spokesman denied McChrystal made any effort to pressure the Pakistani official. Clinton publicly took a tougher line, saying on the CBS program ""60 Minutes"": ""We've made it very clear that if -- heaven forbid -- an attack like this that we can trace back to Pakistan were to have been successful, there would be very severe consequences."" The senior U.S. military official was adamant in saying the U.S. military is not trying to make the Pakistanis accelerate their timetable to move against Taliban strongholds in North Waziristan, a border region long believed to be sheltering al Qaeda and Taliban militants. Kayani has repeatedly said his troops would not expand their operations into North Waziristan until they have finished operations in other areas. ""We are very comfortable with the work they have been doing and where they are at the moment,"" the senior official said. Other senior military officials offer the same assessment. The military official said the current view has been reached even as intelligence increasingly indicates the Times Square bombing plot suspect, Faisal Shahzad, had ""strong links"" to the Pakistani Taliban. ""We believe right now the Pakistanis are doing everything they can,"" the U.S. military official said. He declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. The United States now has independent intelligence to indicate Shahzad had ties to the Pakistani Taliban, according to a U.S. official. The official could not be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly. The independent confirmation is important because it gives the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence community a better understanding of Shahzad's activities without just following leads based on his interrogation. The official said the United States is still trying to figure out ""how deep"" Shahzad's links are to the Pakistani Taliban and ""how high up"" his connections go into the organization. But he emphasized that public statements by top U.S. officials about Shahzad and the Pakistani Taliban are ""not just based on what Shahzad is saying."" He would not discuss additional details about the other intelligence streams of information. ""People are looking into other streams of intelligence that point in a serious way to links to the [Pakistani Taliban],"" the official said. President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, said Sunday, ""It looks like he was working on behalf of the Tariki Taliban Pakistan, the TTP, that's the Pakistan Taliban. This is a group that is closely allied with al Qaeda."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, went further, saying that the plot was directed by the Pakistani Taliban. ""We know that they helped facilitate it; we know that they helped direct it,"" Holder said. ""And I suspect that we are going to come up with evidence which shows that they helped to finance it. They were intimately involved in this plot."" The U.S. official also said the United States is trying to get a better understanding of the TTP's own source of financing. While acknowledging the risk posed by a single Taliban operative, he also said there are indications the TTP lacks extensive financial resources and it's not clear it could set up an extensive operation in the United States. If U.S. intelligence can determine and isolate a target precisely tied to Shahzad, such as the training areas where he might have been sheltered, the most likely scenario is that the U.S. government would call in drone strikes to ensure any lethal action is as precise as possible and potential civilian casualties are minimized, several officials have told CNN. In other news from the region, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan says the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan is as strong as it's ever been. At a White House news conference Monday, Karl Eikenberry acknowledged that there have been ""ups and downs"" in the relationship with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. But Eikenberry said he expected the two countries ""to be able to work our way through difficulties and come back together and still find ourselves well-aligned"" as a result of Karzai's visit to Washington this week to meet with Obama. Also at the news conference, McChrystal said there will be increased violence in Afghanistan ""as our combined security forces expand into Taliban-controlled areas"" in the south.","U.S. secretary of state had warned about Pakistan links to Times Square plot .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Coordinated attacks in at least eight Mexican cities killed three federal police officers and two soldiers Saturday in what officials are calling an unprecedented onslaught by drug gangs. Attacks occurred after arrest of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, a high-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana. Another 18 federal officers were wounded, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing federal police official Rodolfo Cruz Lopez. The attacks were in retribution for the capture early Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, a high-ranking member of the drug cartel known as La Familia Michoacana (The Michoacan Family), Notimex reported. Rueda is considered second in command to the group's two top leaders, Nazario ""El Chayo"" Moreno González and José "" El Chango"" de Jesús Méndez Vargas, acting as a ""right arm"" to Moreno, the secretary of public security said Saturday in a statement. Among other allegations, he was arrested for his role in designing the hierarchy of the organization, the production of synthetic drugs and movement of marijuana and cocaine to the United States, said Mexico's secretary of public security. Rueda was arrested along with a 17-year-old male who worked for him. Following his arrest Saturday morning in Morelia, Michoacan, men armed with high-powered rifles and grenades attacked the police station where he was being held, the Secretary of Public Security said. After failing to win his freedom, members of the group launched attacks in the cities of Morelia, Zitacuaro, Zamora, Lazaro Cardenas, Apatzingan, La Piedad and Huetamo in Michoacan state, Notimex news said, citing federal police. The three officers were killed in Zitacuaro, police official Eduardo Moran told CNN en Español, while six police officers were reported wounded in Morelia. Two soldiers were killed in Zamora, shot by men in a passing car as they walked to their headquarters. The Secretary of Public Security told the newspaper Cambio de Michoacan that 25 spent shells from an R-15 rifle and 17 from an AK-47 were found at the scene. Michoacan is in west-central Mexico, on the Pacific coast. Another rifle and grenade attack took place near Acapulco in Guerrero state, which borders Michoacan, but no one was injured. Saturday's attacks came just days after a drug gang in Tijuana declared they were at war with police, threatening to kill five officers every week until Police Chief Julian Leyzaola resigns. The threat was made in a note found on the windshield of a slain officer's car, news reports said. At least three Tijuana officers have been killed since Monday, reports said. Leyzaola, a former army colonel, replaced a police chief removed from office in December after receiving numerous threats. ""Leyzaola has become the poster boy for honest police work, which has put the drug gangs on notice,"" Vicente Calderon, a reporter for the Tijuana Press news agency, told CNN affiliate KUSI. ""They believe he is serious, that he means business and is trying to re-establish the rule of law that has been affecting the city and whole state for many years since organized crime established themselves in Baja [California]."" Tijuana, the westernmost city in Mexico, is across the border from San Diego, California. Sixteen police officers have died there in 2009, and officers are now patrolling the city in groups of six, KUSI reported. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg and Monica Trevino contributed to this report.","NEW: Gang targets police station where Arnoldo Rueda Medina was being held .

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- There was no way he should have been on that medal stand. Going into the final turn of Saturday night's 1,500-meter short-track speed skating final, J.R. Celski was fifth. The South Korean skaters had a firm grasp on the gold, silver and bronze. And then inexplicably, two of the South Koreans crashed, and the 19-year-old Celski followed teammate Apolo Anton Ohno across the finish line to stunningly finish second and third. Kind of a miracle, but Celski has overcome much bigger odds. Five months ago, it would have impossible for someone to think Celski could win a medal, or even be here. He lay on the ice after a full-speed crash at the U.S. Trials, bleeding profusely, his left thigh sliced open by a skate blade. The cut was six inches wide and two inches deep. It would require 60 stitches. But first he had to remove the blade, which was still stuck in his leg. There was so much blood, he wondered if he was going to skate again. He didn't know it at the time, but the gash was just an inch from the main artery in his leg. Fortunately, the blade only cut muscle. ""When I was laying on that ice, I was in defeat at first,"" he said Sunday. ""I thought my whole career was over. But I guess in those moments is where we truly define ourselves."" At the hospital, Celski asked someone to take a photo of the gash. It is a nasty picture, and while Celski is keen to show it to anyone who will have a look, it is the only time he reflects on the injury. ""After it happened, I knew I needed to get back on my feet, and the way to do that was to not think about it,"" he said. Celski jumped right into rehabilitation under the care of Dr. Eric Heiden, the speed skating legend who is now an orthopedic surgeon, and then Dr. Bill Moreau, the director for sports medicine clinics for the U.S. Olympic Committee. ""There are never any guarantees with an injury like this, but I will say this: Whatever happens to J.R., it will not be because of a lack of effort. He is working so, so hard,"" Moreau told freelance writer Joanne C. Gerstner in early November. By October, Celski was able to throw away his crutches. Though he still couldn't skate, he stayed motivated by going down to a rink near his place at the training center in Colorado and watching the skaters from a local club. He finally got back on the ice on November 16, just eight weeks before the Olympics. It was difficult for him, and he was tentative and he skated very slowly, he said. ""I did have flashbacks at first,"" he said. He even fell a few times during training, which was a good thing because it helped his mental recovery. He found a toughness inside, he said, and his family helped immensely. It was as important as his physical rehabilitation. Before his injury, Celski was the heir apparent to now six-time medallist Ohno. Before his first Olympic race, his first since the crash, he was just a question mark. Now, with two races, the 1,000 meters on Saturday and the 5,000-meter relay on February 26 remaining, he's a remarkable comeback story with an unending smile and a most unusual picture on his iPhone.","J.R.

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- Many kids dream of being in the Olympics one day. When U.S. bobsledder Bill Schuffenhauer was a child in Salt Lake City, Utah, he had no idea the Olympics even existed. All he knew was his parents were drug addicts, that his mother was a prostitute who was often beaten in front of him. He knew that if he was going to survive, he had to do whatever it took to make it. He stole from people; he ate from garbage cans; he got locked up in juvenile detention for breaking into a bike shop when he was trying to get something he could sell for money so he could eat. He had few friends, most of them acquaintances of his mother or the other street kids, many of whom were in gangs. His mom and stepfather were constantly getting evicted. When he wasn't homeless and living in a park, he lived in foster homes. He skipped school a lot. He drank and got high on weed. Life was hard and at times terrifying, and he dreamed of finding a real home. ""I knew that there was something better,"" Schuffenhauer, 36, said last week as he readied for his third Olympic Games. ""And although there were a lot of horrible things that happened, it's made me a stronger person."" Just around the time he was entering junior high, Schuffenhauer's maternal grandmother, Sadie Muniz, took him. She lived in the town of Roy, Utah, about 30 minutes north of Salt Lake City. As tears began to build, he talked about her steadying influence and how she was always there to pull him up or pull him back when he started messing up again. ""She reminded me to never give up and always push on,"" he said. Inspired by her, he began to go to school regularly, even though this multi-ethnic kid stuck out because of his big afro and his shabby clothes. He had one thing that helped him fit in. He could run fast. Something he had relied on to escape the dangers of the streets -- and the cops -- would lead him away from his terrible past. Track and field was to be a turning point; he had real friends now and the parents of one of his teammates eventually would adopt him. His coaches told him he had the talent to be an Olympian. Fueled by that dream, he worked hard in school and in becoming a decathlete. He went to Weber State University and while there he won the junior nationals in 1992. In 2000 he was preparing for the Olympic trials when his track career came to a painful end. An oft-injured ankle failed him again, and hurting so bad he couldn't walk, he had to give up on his dream of going to Sydney. He was crushed, but as he will often remind you, his upbringing, or lack thereof, taught him to be strong. His conversion to bobsledder came thanks to a friend who told him there was a new track in Park City where the U.S. team was training for the 2002 Winter Olympics. He went down there to check it out and kept going back until the bobsledders noticed the 6-foot, 200-pounder and asked him if he wanted to try out as a pusher. He joined the team and raced periodically but wasn't a regular member until fate seemingly stepped in. One of the Olympic team members on the top U.S. four-man team tested positive for steroids, so Schuffenhauer was called into duty. That crew, piloted by Todd Hays, won a silver medal at the Salt Lake Games. Schuffenhauer retired from bobsledding after the 2006 Torino Games, where he was part of the two-man team that finished 14th. He had two children and a girlfriend, Ruthann Savage, whom he met in 2004, and he felt responsible for them. Supporting a family on the meager money bobsledders get was impossible, and it was time to find a job and settle down in Utah. That worked for two years, until the desire to compete came back when he saw the team racing at Park City. He became obsessed with going to Vancouver. He and Savage had to solve a dilemma: either he would give up on the idea of another Olympics or he would go back to full-time training with the team. It was a risky move; if he left he wasn't guaranteed a spot on an Olympic sled. Now in his mid-30s, he'd be challenged by pushers much younger than him. ""It's been amazing that she's been able to stand by me,"" he said of Savage, now his fiancée. ""She's the financial supporter of my life. She's having to sacrifice to make my dreams come true."" But Savage is a nurse, and her salary wasn't enough to pay the mortgage on the home they bought shortly after they first met. They weren't able to pay the loan on one of their cars either. The bank kicked them out, and Savage and the kids moved into a rental while Schuffenhauer went away for seven months at a time. Schuffenhauer tried raising money from sponsors. The owners of the store where he was caught stealing as a youth offered him one of their bikes to raffle off. But with the economy in free fall, he barely sold any tickets. There are still tickets available on his Web site, billschuffenhauer.com. And other companies didn't have the extra funds to give. It got worse. At the beginning of the 2008-2009 season, Schuffenhauer suffered a serious injury, two herniated disks in his neck, that made it difficult to use his arms to push the sled. He remained resolute that he would make the Olympics even though he was now an alternate. He worked closely with a chiropractor and a team physician to get back on track. In January, a healthy Schuffenhauer and his USA3 teammates went to a race in St. Moritz, Switzerland, with a very outside chance of qualifying for the Olympics. They finished sixth in the event, and Schuffenhauer's dream was realized. ""The dream is happening right now. I'm here. That's all I wanted,"" he said. Then he added, ""It would be nice to get a medal of any color."" It is improbable his team will medal in the four-man competition, which begins Friday. But Schuffenhauer has faced improbable many times before. And even though many people come up to him to tell him how he is a hero, he can't see it that way. He figures himself just a regular guy who had a goal and was able to achieve it. Heroes are teachers and doctors, he said. After the Games, Schuffenhauer plans to return home, find work, take online classes towards a sports science degree and move to the next chapter of his life. Asked if those chapters will take written form one day, he said he had considered it, but right now he has a family to return to. And family is what matters most of all.","As a child, bobsledder Bill Schuffenhauer often lived on the streets .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The curious faces scrutinize the classroom kitchen, where pots and pans dangle from the ceiling and sharp knives glisten on the counter next to heaps of spinach and ripe green peppers. The one-night, hands-on course, called Food 101, is meant for them. They are the cooking inept, who can't properly to chop an onion, let alone sauté a medley of vegetables. First-time student Jessica Clark, 33, of Atlanta, is attending the course offered by Cook's Warehouse because she is dubious of her kitchen abilities. She only knows how to prepare grilled chicken and steamed broccoli (and on some nights canned black beans and rice). Her boyfriend is sick of eating the same thing at home. She is sick of eating out. ""I usually make whatever is easy, and I guess that's not much,"" says Clark, dressed in an apron with her fingers still wet from fumbling through the tomato dicing activity. ""I've avoided the kitchen for 33 years."" Cooking dinner? There's an app for that . From British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to First Lady Michelle Obama, a food revolution is brewing in America, a push to return to the bygone days when healthy home-cooked meals were much more frequent. Despite the efforts to get Americans back into the kitchen, there still exists a group of adults in their 20s and 30s -- like Clark -- who are clueless in the kitchen. Ironically, these 20- and 30-somethings may have stretched their palates while traveling the world and even spend hours watching the cooking shows and ""Top Chef,"" but they are defeated when they enter the kitchen. They don't own cooking utensils in their Tupperware-filled cabinets. They rely on microwaves, restaurants and takeout menus to feed their empty stomachs. Simply put, they cannot cook. ""Lots of people think, read and talk about food, but they don't know how to do anything,"" said Jennifer Berg, head of the Food Studies program at New York University. ""There is an incredible disconnect to actually knowing how to do something."" I never learned to cook . No one tracks precisely how many young noncookers exist, but it's easy to find them. Just ask anyone between the ages of 20 and 40, and they will shrug and say either they can't cook -- or point to a friend who can't make anything. They come with plenty of excuses for their cooking incompetence: ""My friends would rather eat out.  ... I don't like cleaning the mess afterwards. ... Cooking for one person is impractical. ... I'm too busy with my job to cook. ... I live in a city with plenty of affordable restaurant options. ... My New York City kitchen is too small."" ""I couldn't tell if she wanted the big bubbles or little bubbles,"" says Sharita Robertson of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reflecting back on a time in her early 20s when a friend asked her to boil some eggs. Robertson never had to boil anything before her friend asked her. She admits her mother cooked meals for her growing up, but she doesn't know why she never learned. ""I just never had to do any of it,"" she says. Robertson, now 30, has a 7-year-old daughter, but she rarely prepares anything more complicated than opening a jar of spaghetti sauce and boxed pasta. One time, she tried to fry some chicken, but the attempt ended with a disastrous blister on her leg. Most of the time, her mother cooks for her daughter. Restaurants, processed foods take over . At all ages, there are individuals who cannot cook. But NYU food studies expert Jennifer Berg theorizes the group of 20- and 30-somethings can't cook mainly because of a dependence on processed foods that took hold in the 1970s. Greasy snacks, frozen dinners and instant soups flooded the marketplace, replacing traditional home cooking as mothers joined the workplace. During this period, the feminist movement grew stronger, Berg explained. A stigma formed around mothers who cooked meals from scratch. They were labeled domesticated women tied to the household, Berg said. Home economics classes were out, working mothers were in. And so, Berg says a generation of children never learned from their mothers how to cook. Another reason why some people cannot cook, some food experts believe, is that the restaurant culture took hold of the American family. Dual incomes made restaurants more affordable to the growing middle class. In particular, fast food chains such as McDonald, Pizza Hut and Burger King began invading almost every community in America. Nearly half of spending on food in the American family went to ""food away from home"" in 2008, according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. In 1970, about 30 percent of food dollars were spent away from home. ""If you have a great food scene and so many affordable options, then you don't need to necessarily be in your own kitchen,"" said Amy Cao, 26, a food writer who created the AmyBlogsChow.com. ""Cooking is no longer a survival tactic."" Cao 26, admits on her blog that she cannot cook even though her job is to dine and review restaurants across New York City. Her inability to cook inspired her video series called ""Stupidly Simple Snacks"" on her blog, where she helps young noncookers learn how to prepare a quick snack. In one of her fast-paced, three-minute online videos, she looks uncomfortable in the kitchen as she teaches her viewers how to make a Greek salad that only requires putting chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and feta cheese in a large mixing bowl. She struggles to use the pepper grinder, and then casually tops the salad with balsamic vinegar and a few pinches of salt. Cao hopes the simple recipe can make cooking less daunting for young folks like herself. The great obesity war . Studies have shown that eating out usually consumes more calories than cooking at home, which has complicated the obesity epidemic. About 34 percent of adults in the United States are considered obese, defined as having a BMI 30 or higher, according to the CDC. The obesity epidemic has motivated the food reform efforts by Jamie Oliver and Michelle Obama. ""If you don't know how to cook, then you have no options,"" writes Oliver to CNN. ""You're forced into a series of bad choices and a diet of mostly processed foods ... cooking skills are life skills and just as important as knowing how to manage your money."" In the March edition of Newsweek, first lady Michelle Obama, who has embarked on the fight against child obesity, wrote about the lack of healthy home cooking. ""Back when many of us were growing up, we led lives that kept most of us at a pretty healthy weight,"" she wrote. ""We walked to school every day, ran around at recess and gym and for hours before dinner, and ate home-cooked meals that always seemed to have a vegetable on the plate."" A cooking comeback? Some food experts argue a revival of cooking has emerged among the young adults, both male and female, over the last decade. The Internet is loaded with young foodies, blogging and posting about their culinary adventures. The popular Food Netwook will launch the Cooking Channel this month, a trendier sister channel that targets younger audiences. Cao writes on her blog that she's trying to learn to cook for the sake of her health and wallet. Several weeks ago she learned to bake tarragon chicken. It's a recipe that took three times to get right. She mashed the spices into the butter and then coated the chicken breast all by herself. Barbara Fairchild, editor of Bon Appetit magazine, said she's noticed subscriptions jumped among 20- to 30-year-olds over the past few years. ""Cooking is hip now,"" she said. ""It's not just for someone with a French accent who is 70 years old and lives in Paris. It's become much more inclusive."" Back in the Cook's Warehouse classroom kitchen in Atlanta, there is only one bloody finger by the end of the night from a dicing and chopping exercise. The steam from the freshly made vegetable stock is simmering in the pot. A steak is being seared on a pan in a homemade sauce. The students are eager to enjoy a home-cooked meal. Clark says she is inspired by the course. No more chicken and steamed broccoli. With some basic cooking skills, she's going to throw her friends a dinner party, all from scratch.","Ushered by Jamie Oliver and others, there's a push to get Americans back into the kitchen .

"(CNN) -- About as mature as a third-grade boy, the comedy web series ""The Annoying Orange"" proves once again that everyone secretly loves corny jokes. The semi-animated shorts, appearing on YouTube and elsewhere, generally feature the titular orange talking to another food, such as an apple or a pizza. The daft but relentless orange pelts them with asinine jokes, including those of the classic ""Orange you glad?"" variety. Launched earlier this year by animator Daneboe of GagFilms, ""Annoying Orange"" has amassed a hefty 137 million views. What does the unlikely success of ""Annoying Orange,"" say about the web, and entertainment in general? 1. Short is in. The average Annoying Orange episode is about a minute. It is simple, bite-sized and addictive -- practically requiring people to jump from one show to the next. 2. The web's a money-maker. Internet businesses make it easier for free web series like ""Annoying Orange"" to make an actual profit. Fans can visit the ""Annoying Orange"" YouTube page for t-shirts done by SpreadShirt and, via YouTube's ad program, Daneboe can make money on every view. It may be pennies on each visit, but it becomes serious dough when you're talking millions of visits. ""Annoying Orange"" holds several top 20 spots on YouTube, including among the most-subscribed channels of all time. 3. People are noticing. The biggest proof of impact might be what some call a rip-off of the series in TV ads for Nabisco Cheez-Its. Set in a lab, a food scientist is verbally insulted by a wheel of cheddar cheese which he deems not ""mature"" enough. Should the ""Annoying Orange"" team be getting a payoff from Nabisco?Judge for yourself.","The semi-animated shorts feature an orange talking to another food .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- There's no reason China's spat with Internet search giant Google should hurt relations with the United States, China's foreign ministry said Tuesday. A day earlier, Google announced that it had stopped censoring search results in China. ""The Google incident is just an individual action taken by one company. I can't see it having any impact on Sino-U.S. relations, unless someone wants to politicize it,"" foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Tuesday. ""It is not the image of China that has been undermined, rather it is that of Google."" Google's announcement came amid speculation that the search giant would pull out of China entirely. In a post on its official blog, Google said it stopped running the censored Google.cn service on Monday and was routing its Chinese users to an uncensored version of Google based in Hong Kong. The special administrative region offers more freedom than mainland China. ""We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement,"" Senior Vice President David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said on the blog. Google hopes the move ""will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China,"" Drummond wrote. ""We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision, though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services,"" he added. Google said it would monitor whether access to the site is blocked in mainland China. Early reports from China suggested that the government was already restricting access to Google's Hong Kong-based site, said Eddan Katz, international affairs director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""We've already heard indications that visitors to Google.hk are getting 'can't find page' errors,"" said Katz, whose group promotes free speech online. The company on Monday also launched a dashboard page, which it promises to update daily, that will show which Google services are available in China. According to the page, YouTube, Google Sites and Google's Blogger apps were blocked Monday afternoon. Observers said Google's actions amount to a withdrawal from China and highlights expectations that the government will censor search results. Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk Centre, which studies the intersection of digital policy and human rights, said Google's move didn't come as a surprise. ""It's become unsustainable for Google to operate in this environment,"" he said. ""They've made a decision that the risks are too great for them, so they're going to pull out."" Google launched Google.cn in 2006. That enterprise prompted complaints that the company was sacrificing Web freedoms by complying with Chinese censorship in return for access to a huge market. The company, whose slogan is ""Don't be evil,"" countered that operating in limited form gave Chinese users more information than than they would have had otherwise. Google also hoped its presence would advance online freedom in China. In January, Google announced that the company and at least 20 others were victims of a ""highly sophisticated and targeted [hacking] attack"" originating in China in mid-December, evidently to gain access to the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The company said the attacker or attackers gained access to the header -- or subject-line information -- from the e-mails of two human rights activists through the Google network. Google-China move hurts businesses, academics . In a speech on Internet freedom and security in January, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged China to investigate such attacks and accusations of government involvement, saying they raised ""very serious concerns."" China rejected the claims. ""Accusation that the Chinese government participated in [any] cyber attack, either in an explicit or inexplicit way, is groundless and aims to denigrate China,"" the official Xinhua News Agency quoted a spokesman for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology as saying. ""We are firmly opposed to that."" As a result of the attack, Google said, it was no longer willing to abide by the filters that the Chinese government demanded. Briefly afterward, Google.cn was retrieving results for sensitive topics, including the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square, the Dalai Lama and the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement. But about a day later, search results appeared to return to normal. It's not just China -- Google censors results elsewhere, too . Advocates of Internet freedoms cheered Google's move Monday. ""It demonstrates that a company like Google, with the business stakes in a market as large as China, can make the decision that free and open Internet is a better business alternative and a better ethical choice for its users,"" Katz said. Internet users gravitate toward sites with unrestricted information, he said. ""This is an example of how the genie can't be put back in the bottle."" Deibert, who co-founded the OpenNet Initiative, said China might go further as a next step: blocking all outside search engines from accessing Web information in the country. ""If such a radical measure happens, that would have major implications for cyberspace as a whole,"" he said. ""It would point to a more regionalized Internet"" and perhaps embolden countries such as Iran to follow suit, Deibert said. Google.cn is the preferred search tool for about 13 percent of Chinese Web users, according to a state-sponsored survey. Baidu.com, a government-friendly Chinese search engine, dominates mainland China with about 77 percent of users, the survey said. Google's announcement had been widely anticipated. Internet companies operating in China face a March 31 deadline to renew licenses to do business there, according to the Beijing Communications Administration. The blog post by Drummond said Google plans to continue research and development work in China and to maintain a limited sales presence there. In an apparent attempt to protect Google employees in China, the post said the decision was made by Google's top brass in the United States. ""Despite all the uncertainty and difficulties they have faced since we made our announcement in January, [Google's China employees] have continued to focus on serving our Chinese users and customers,"" the blog said. ""We are immensely proud of them."" CNN's John Vause, Doug Gross and Brandon Griggs contributed to this report.","Dispute over censorship an isolated issue, foreign ministry spokesman says .

"Woods Hole, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Our need for oil almost wiped out the sperm whale once, and now our insatiable hunger for it threatens them again. Sperm whales were hunted in the Gulf of Mexico in the 18th and 19th centuries for their oil, but were somewhat spared when petroleum replaced whale oil as an energy source. Now, instead of hunters, the same oil that helped to save the sperm whales from extinction threatens their survival in the Gulf. Sperm whales, listed as endangered in 1970, are social animals. The young live with their mothers for years in stable groups, and the whales dive deep in search of food. Because they spend so much of their lives undersea, our knowledge of their behavior and community structure is limited. We have a lot to learn before we can say we truly know these animals. We do know that sperm whales depend on the deep ocean habitat. And we know that habitat in the Gulf is severely threatened by the disastrous BP oil spill -- particularly as the oil spreads through plumes that go deep into the water. [On Tuesday, the decomposed body of a juvenile sperm whale was found 77 miles from the well, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Investigators are trying to determine whether oil played a role in its death; it was not found in oiled water.] . Routinely holding their breath for about 45 minutes, sperm whales can dive half a mile to hunt fish and squid. When they arrive at the surface, they spend about nine minutes breathing and preparing for their next dive. About 1,665 sperm whales live in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, and reports say about 300 to 400 of them depend on deep waters near the mouth of the Mississippi River. Whalers, centuries ago, found that the Mississippi Canyon, off the Mississippi River Delta, was a hot spot for sperm whales. A recent review of whalers' logbooks shows that from 1788 to 1877, about 204 voyages spent at least one season whaling in the Gulf. Recent research indicates about 40 whales at any one time live around the Mississippi Canyon, and females and immature whales prefer this area. BP's undersea well gushing out oil is in this canyon. The aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill offers a glimpse into what might be in store for the sperm whales of the Gulf. Many North Pacific killer whales died throughout the year after that 11 million gallon spill. Forty percent of the whales in the most exposed groups died, including all of the breeding females in one group. As more long-term studies emerge, we see that after 20 years, the killer whales still have not fully recovered. Risk factors for the sperm whales of the Gulf are similar to those for the killer whales of coastal Alaska: They are swimming in oil; females and juveniles depend on critical habitat near the spill, and the population is already small and isolated. Oil can damage and kill marine mammals in myriad ways. The major threat to sperm whales is probably breathing in volatile organic compounds at the surface. The residents of New Orleans, Louisiana, may smell a bad odor from the spill, but imagine, after a 45-minute dive, surfacing into a noxious cloud of contaminated air. Breathing these fumes can lead to pneumonia, damage to the brain, liver and other organs; unconsciousness and death. And the dispersants added to the oil are actually more volatile than crude. Oil could also contaminate or kill the fish and squid that sperm whales eat. These creatures are highly sensitive to toxic compounds in oil. As the oil spreads, it will create a greater risk. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission warned about oil and gas exploration in the Gulf. Considering the risk of a large oil spill to marine mammals, the commission said ""such effects might result in the complete loss of a regional population and require three or more generations to recover."" BP and its federal regulators ignored these warnings. But they were far from alone. Every single person in the United States who uses oil has a personal connection to this spill. As I watch footage of the oil flowing into this deepwater habitat, I realize that I am partially responsible. If Americans didn't use as much oil as we do, we wouldn't have to drill as much -- or at all. It's too soon to say what will become of the sperm whale in the Gulf of Mexico. But it is fair to say a new energy source won't suddenly emerge to replace petroleum. So, what can we do? We can support clean energy in every way possible, but we also must decrease our oil consumption. Maybe we will all be able to learn something from this disaster and adapt. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Heather Heenehan.","Heather Heenehan: Sperm whales once hunted for their oil; now oil threatens their lives .

"(Mashable) -- AT&T is officially opening up its recommendation service, Buzz.com, to the public. We wrote about the project when it was still in beta in January. The service is essentiallyYelp meets Yellowpages.com and it shares a lot of similarities with the new Google Places. The idea behindBuzz.com is to leverage users' existing social graphs alongside traditional, location-based business search. So if I look up ""movie theater"" in Atlanta, Georgia, I can see not just a listing of places, but also how many people have rated the place as a ""favorite"" and if any of my friends have rated or favorited it as well. Right now, Buzz.com integrates with Facebook Connect, so you can ask questions via Buzz.com and on Facebook to receive recommendations and answers to your queries. We assume that Buzz.com will integrate with Twitter in the future as well. Although open to the public, the product is still very much in beta. While the interface seems easy enough to use, I had lots of duplicate or outdated entries in my search results. This is something that can be cleaned up, but right now it's difficult to rate or favorite a place when it is listed numerous times. While location-based search paired with reviews from others and from your own social graph is a very cool concept, it's also not very original at this point. AT&T has been developing Buzz.com for more than a year and a half, so this isn't so much a case of being late to the party as it is poor timing -- and poor naming. One of the biggest questions we have about Buzz.com is, in truth, its name. Yahoo Buzz came to the market first, followed by Google Buzz earlier this year. It's understandable that with a private beta already underway, AT&T wouldn't want to change product names; however, in this case, we think the company should have considered it. Google Buzz coupled with Google Places is extremely similar to what Buzz.com is all about. The only real difference is that Buzz.com is designed to plug into Facebook Connect, whereas Google is using its own social graph. Facebook integration sounds like a plus, but at this stage, the extent of the integration and how useful it will be largely depends on how many of your friends are going to sign up and use Buzz.com. Google Buzz isn't the only service that Buzz.com is going against; Yelp, Citysearch and more location-based social networks like Foursquare, Gowalla and Loopt are all in this same territory. What value is Buzz.com going to offer users that these already established services don't? From what we can see, Buzz.com is really an attempt to modernize the aging YellowPages.com ecosystem. With Google Places, YellowPages.com has increased competition, and we think that Buzz.com will need to get some killer features -- like pulling in recommendations from other location-based sites and promoting special offers or coupons -- and that the YellowPages.com database will need to be seriously culled in order for this idea to take hold. AT&T says it wants to use its experience in building mobile applications to make Buzz.com a more mobile destination. While a default Buzz.com connect/search bar might have worked in the pre-smartphone era, we live in the world of ""there's an app for that."" Buzz.com will also need to make its mobile applications and mobile support robust. In time, the site might develop into something compelling and competitive. However, at this stage, the entire concept strikes us as being too derivative -- in name and in function -- with myriad other services. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday his televised health care summit with Republican leaders on February 25 should involve true give-and-take negotiations instead of mere ""political theater."" In a rare appearance at the daily White House media briefing, Obama said he wants the meeting -- which also will include health care experts -- to ""establish some common facts"" on the health care issue and reach agreement on the most pressing health care problems facing the country. To signal his willingness to compromise, Obama said he would consider a Republican push to include limits on medical malpractice lawsuits in a health care bill if the proposal can be shown to truly reduce overall health care costs. The president acknowledged the issue could ""make my party uncomfortable,"" an apparent nod to traditional Democratic support among trial lawyers who oppose such limits. However, Obama said bipartisanship on health care reform cannot mean only that ""Democrats give up everything they believe in."" ""Bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside matters of party for the good of the country,"" he said. Obama's comments followed a meeting with top congressional leaders from both parties, the first since he pledged in last month's State of the Union address to hold regular bipartisan talks. Republican leaders in the meeting later repeated their past insistence that the upcoming health care negotiations start from scratch, instead of building on separate Democratic health care bills passed by the House and Senate. ""What we need to do is start over, go step-by-step on a truly bipartisan basis to try to reach an agreement,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters. ""My members are open to doing that."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, indicated he and other GOP chiefs are ready to attend the February 25 health care summit, but have questions for the White House on the lineup and agenda for the meeting. Boehner noted Republican leaders sent White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel a letter Monday asking for details of the proposed talks. ""The letter last night tried to understand what the purpose of the meeting is,"" Boehner said, adding: ""If we're truly going to have a bipartisan conversation, then let's just scrap this bill that the Democrats can't pass in the House or Senate and let's start over on a real conversation about how to make the current system work better."" The half-day summit is an attempt by the Obama administration to rescue health care legislation, a top domestic priority for the president. Televising it also would help fulfill a campaign promise by Obama that health care negotiations would be broadcast live. The planned talks with Republicans are the first clear strategy by Obama and Democrats on how to proceed on health care after losing their 60-seat supermajority in the Senate. Republican Scott Brown was sworn in as the new U.S. senator from Massachusetts last week, leaving the Democrats one vote shy of being able to overcome GOP filibusters of health care reform and other major initiatives. Obama first floated the idea of face-to-face, televised talks with Republicans to seek a health care compromise last week. In a speech Thursday at a fundraising event, he said whatever legislation emerges from the talks should then go to Congress for a vote. He announced the planned meeting in a nationally televised interview with CBS before the Super Bowl on Sunday, and said Tuesday that the idea is to reach agreement on solving a problem that only will get worse. As an example, Obama cited a report his week that Anthem Blue Cross, which he called the largest insurer in California, was planning to raise premiums for individual health policies by as much as 39 percent. ""If we don't act, this is just a preview of coming attractions: Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance, millions more will lose their coverage altogether, our deficits will continue to grow larger,"" Obama said, adding that ""we have an obligation -- both parties -- to tackle this issue in a serious way."" That means both Democrats and Republicans will have to accept a bill that lacks all they want, but does the right thing for the country, Obama said. ""I'm willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway, but there's got to be some give from their side as well,"" the president said. First lady Michelle Obama, appearing Tuesday on CNN's ""Larry King,"" said she's ""hopeful that Congress will come together"" to get health care legislation passed. ""We're spending billions of dollars on preventable diseases and new health care legislation could go a long way to improving prevention, first and foremost,"" the first lady said. ""People have to have a pediatrician in order to get good information from their pediatrician. People have to be able to take their kids to well doctor visits to have all this information tracked,"" she said. ""So, we have to get this done."" The Republican letter to Emanuel on the February 25 meeting offered the GOP view, saying: ""Bipartisanship is not writing proposals of your own behind closed doors, then unveiling them and demanding Republican support. Bipartisan ends require bipartisan means."" Republicans complain that the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate rammed through their preferred bills without giving GOP issues a fair hearing. Obama and Democrats respond that the bills went through the full legislative process, including lengthy committee meetings and floor debate, with Republicans taking part and offering amendments, including some that were accepted. Obama said last week that Democratic leaders were completing work on merging the House and Senate health care bills into a single Democratic proposal for the talks with Republicans. A key question for the February 25 talks will be whether Obama and Democratic leaders want their merged health care bill to serve as the starting point for an agreement. Republicans complain the comprehensive Democratic health care bills would lead to a government takeover of health care. They call for smaller steps focused on individual issues, such as limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. Democrats, however, say that spiraling health care costs that threaten the nation's future economic stability can only be addressed through comprehensive reform. Obama said last week that the merged Democratic bill would expand coverage to 30 million Americans who currently lack health insurance while reducing long-term health care costs. It proposes an insurance exchange to allow people and small business owners to pool together to purchase coverage, Obama said, but he made no mention of a government-run public health insurance option that Republicans have rallied against. Obama said the Democratic proposal would include reforms that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions or capping lifetime benefits. ""And by the way, all of it is paid for,"" Obama said. ""Not only is it deficit neutral, but the Congressional Budget Office, which is the bipartisan office that is the scorekeeper for how much things cost in Congress, says it is going to reduce the costs by $1 trillion."" Obama called health care reform the ""single best way to bring down our deficits. ""Nobody has disputed that,"" he added. ""Nobody can dispute the fact that if we don't tackle surging health care costs, then we can't control our budget,"" he said. CNN's Ed Henry, Dana Bash, Tom Cohen and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","President spoke after meeting with top congressional leaders from both parties .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth celebrates her 82nd birthday Saturday with a parade and military ceremony known as ""Trooping the Color."" Britain's Queen Elizabeth attends the Derby Festival at Epson Downs horse race course on June 7. The queen's birthday is actually April 21, but she officially celebrates it every year on a Saturday in June when good weather is more likely, according to Buckingham Palace. During the ceremony, which is open to the public, the queen inspects the troops. They then march past the queen, who rides in a carriage back to the palace. The Royal Air Force then conducts a colorful fly-past over Buckingham Palace while the queen and her family watch from the balcony. The queen has attended Trooping the Color every year of her reign except for one -- 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace says. The ceremony gets its name from a tradition where colors of the battalion were carried, or ""trooped,"" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by the soldiers, Buckingham Palace says.","Queen's April birthday is celebrated in June to enjoy good weather .

"MacDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Florida (CNN) -- No piece of equipment is more crucial to a soldier in the field than his rifle. And America's most elite troops are about to get a new series of rifles designed for their unique and dangerous missions. CNN was given an exclusive look at two new rifles for an elite group of U.S. troops. ""The difference is, I'm gonna have a weapon that's gonna fit the situation,"" an Army Ranger staff sergeant said. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is about to start training its SEALs, Green Berets and other Special Operations troops in the use of Mark 16 and Mark 17 rifles. Within a year, the new rifles should be in action against terrorists and insurgents in Iraq, Afghanistan and hot spots the public may never hear about. The usually secretive SOCOM gave CNN an exclusive chance to see and even fire the new weapon recently at its headquarters near Tampa, Florida.  Watch a preview of the new weapons » . The contractors working with SOCOM to develop the weapon say it is more versatile and more accurate, jams less and lasts longer than the current rifle used by many Special Operations troops, the M-4. The Mark 16 (Mk16) fires a 5.56 mm round, the same size used for decades in M-16s and M-4s. The Mk17 fires a larger 7.62 mm round that is used in some U.S. military machine guns, but it's not the same round as in the AK-47, the world's most widely used assault rifle. Both of the new rifles are designed to kill regardless of the situation. ""Whether that's a soft target, a guy without body armor, or whether that's an enemy force within a vehicle that you need to shoot through a window or the side of the vehicle and you want to ensure that round is not deflected,"" said Tucker Campion, a retired Navy SEAL who now is a civilian contractor working on the new rifles. ""We want a round that, when it hits the enemy soldier, provides the maximum amount of damage."" Even though they fire different-size bullets, each rifle is largely interchangeable with the other. By changing only a few parts, including the bolt and the barrel, a soldier can switch from a gun that fires the lighter 5.56 mm round to one that shoots the heavier 7.62 mm round in a matter of minutes. That's just one example of the rifle's versatility. Each gun comes with three interchangeable barrels, and each gives the troops a specific advantage. ""If you were going to clear an urban environment, buildings, rooms, you'd probably throw the short barrel on there,"" the staff sergeant said. CNN is honoring the Ranger's request not to identify him, because in battle, anonymity is crucial for Special Operations troops. ""If you're in Afghanistan and you're walking in the mountains and the hills and all that, and your distance is going to be a lot greater to the enemy, and you're probably going to want to throw the longer barrel on there so you get that extra reach,"" the Ranger said. Even though the rifles fire the same bullets as existing weapons, they are designed to be much more accurate. ""If you look at a current inventory assault rifle, you get 350 to 400 meters,"" Campion said of their range of accuracy. ""Put a long barrel in (the new rifle), and now you're at 6 to 7 (hundred meters). So we're extending the standoff between us and the enemy."" A longer standoff means an American can shoot an enemy soldier from farther away; thus, the American is safer. One of the main goals was to design a gun that lasts longer. Campion says the M-4 is designed to fire 6,000 rounds over five years. But the Mk16 and Mk17 were designed for Special Operations, who are likely to fire 6,000 rounds in less than one year. The new rifles are designed to handle the greater rate of use and last twice as long. The design changes that make the Mk16 and Mk17 last longer also make them more reliable. Nothing is worse for a GI in battle than for his rifle to jam at the wrong moment, but it happens with all kinds of guns. These new rifles are designed to reduce those jamming problems as much as possible. The new rifle also comes in a Mk13 model, which includes a grenade launcher mounted below the barrel. To those who will use the rifles in the field, what they need first and foremost from the new weapons is success.

"(CNN) -- Phyllophorous: an adjective meaning ""leaf-bearing"" or, alternately, ""the word that exiled me to the oft-fabled Crying Room at the 1986 National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C."" Strangely, I didn't mind; I'd already gotten my prize. Very few of us are lovely on the outside at age 13, and even less so are those of us inclined toward worrying words down to their etymological nubbins. My light-socket perm, train track braces and penchant for unicorn sweatshirts weren't doing me any favors when it came to feeling at ease among my peers back home. Yes, I'd gotten attention from the local press, glossy plaques, a pep rally at my Fort Thomas, Kentucky, school and, creepily enough, an obscene phone call -- all accolades for my ascent through regional bee wins. However, I'd have gladly traded every scrap of that for a chance to feel like one of the girls who knew how to give herself Sun-In highlights and flirt adorably with the boys on the basketball team. That was until I met Karla. Upon arrival at the Grand Hyatt hotel, spellers were issued a blue, plastic-bound autograph book as impetus to mingle with our fellow contenders. After some initial hesitation, I actually began to enjoy the ritual of handing over the little talisman, scribbling something silly in the the book they'd handed me in return, then trading back and madly flipping through to see what they'd written to me. I liked Karla right away. She was ""bee royalty"" -- a brash, third-time competitor from Roanoke, Virginia, prone to yelling things like ""Nuke the French!"" and quoting British comedy shows.  As she doodled an elaborate self-portrait that filled a whole page in the back of the book, she gave me the lay of the land. That kid over there -- rumor had it his family had hired a professional coach to prep him. That girl -- home-schooled. Don't look for her at any of the mixers or day trips. Her mom was going to keep her locked in the hotel room, cramming until the very last second. 2010 Spelling Bee kicked off Wednesday . Karla, herself, wasn't going to be skimping on socializing and sightseeing, but she was going to sequester herself for some last-minute studying in the hopes of making one last run at the title in her final year of eligibility. And oddly -- very oddly -- for me, a kid prone to gut-grinding panic attacks, self-flagellation over academic success and generally ill at ease in my own skin, I began to sink into calm. I wasn't, for once, the dorkiest girl in the room, and instead was surrounded by kids who lived for language play, lovely books, good grades and a life of the mind. I'd suddenly found my people. And while there wasn't a gawky little ghost of a chance that I was going to beat them in the bee this year, I was cool with that. My cool lasted until we hit the ballroom stage the next day and a few hundred terrified, raw-nerved elementary school kids with pasteboard number signs around our necks had to stand in front of cameras from every major national news organization and spell words that I could have sworn the announcers were making up on the spot: gobemouche, phaeochrous, exiguous. Many kids hemmed, hawed, begged, borrowed and stole time with requests for definitions, etymologies, sentence use. I just went for it. Machine (duh!). Ethos (a word I shoehorn into conversation as frequently as possible). I think there's another round I'm still blocking out. And then: ""Phyllophorous."" ""Could you repeat that?"" ""Phyllophorous."" ""Uh...F-I-L..."" Buzz. Incorrect. My head, now freed of its duties for the day, floated somewhere off into the middle distance, and I trudged off to the Crying Room where some well-meaning volunteers offered tissues, cookies and hugs to spellers whose dreams had been shattered. I opted for the cookie and went off to apologize to my dad, who'd spent a goodly amount of his evenings on my training. That's OK, he assured me. He was just excited that we'd get to go to more museums. Did I want to hit the National Gallery now? I'd wanted to go to that museum for ages, but instead, I took my place in the audience and watched my friend Karla battle through several more rounds before butting up against, I believe the word was, ""dentifrice."" She joined me in the ballroom, kibitzing at my side as speller 102, Jon Pennington of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, took home top honors for ""odontalgia"" - a fancy word for toothache. Karla grumbled that she totally could have gotten that one. I nodded in sympathy. Jon went on TV to visit David Letterman and spell against Johnny Carson, where I'm happy to say, one of Doc Severinson's bandmates spelled ""phyllophorous"" incorrectly. Jon got cash prizes and a place in the history books. I got a weird, funny friend who kind of understood me. And that was o-k-a-y with me.","Kat Kinsman went to the National Spelling Bee at age 13 in 1986 .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli troops have completed their withdrawal from Gaza after a three-week military campaign against Hamas militants, the Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday. Palestinians look at an damaged rocket launcher left behind by Israeli forces. ""The forces are now redeployed outside the Gaza Strip, and are prepared for any development,"" a military statement read. During their withdrawal, Israeli troops warned Gaza residents to avoid unexploded bombs or shells left behind and report their location to Israeli authorities. Israel said it had achieved its goal to halt Hamas' firing of rockets into southern Israel from Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has controlled the territory since 2007, also declared victory in the conflict during a rally in Gaza City on Tuesday. Israeli troops began to withdraw Sunday following tentative, separate cease-fire declarations by Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Hamas. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who visited the territory Tuesday, criticized both sides and the international community for what he called their ""collective political failure"" in settling the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""I have condemned from the outbreak of this conflict the excessive use of force by Israeli forces in Gaza. I view the rocket attacks into Israel as completely unacceptable. We need to restore basic respect for civilians,"" he said.  Watch troops prepare to withdraw » . The conflict, which began December 27, has left more than 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead. Confirmation of the Israeli withdrawal came within a day of the inauguration of Barack Obama as the new president of the United States, replacing George W. Bush, whose administration was among the most supportive of Israel in decades. Ban said he hoped Obama would consider settling the conflict ""a matter of priority."" Speaking during a visit to Sderot, the southern Israeli city that has endured rocket fire from Hamas for years, Ban said the Bush administration was ""leading and heavily engaged"" in the region, but added, ""Unfortunately, we have not achieved the goals."" Obama has vowed to move swiftly and has said he was assembling a strong team to be ""immediately engaged"" on ""day one."" In a statement welcoming the new U.S. president, Olmert said Israel and the United States would remain ""full partners in advancing peace and stability in the Middle East.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Angelina Jolie was on a stage Thursday but wasn't performing. Instead, she paid tribute to the millions of uprooted people across the globe made homeless by war. Angelina Jolie said that sheltering countries can learn from the way refugees survive their difficulties. A U.N. goodwill ambassador, Jolie was in Washington to observe World Refugee Day, an annual event that falls on Saturday this year. The poignant ceremony was sponsored by the United Nations refugee agency. Tears flowed as refugees and displaced people shared their harrowing experiences and advocates related what they'd seen in refugee camps. ""I believe we must persuade the world that refugees must not be simply viewed as a burden,"" she said. ""They are the survivors. And they can bring those qualities to the service of their communities and the countries that shelter them."" Jolie spoke of her visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Pakistan. She met a boy about 15 years old in a Tanzanian refugee camp who, without a wheelchair, had to crawl since a shot in the back paralyzed him. His family was killed, leaving him as an orphan. Yet when he spoke with her, he did it with a smile. ""He had this really remarkable, unbreakable spirit,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper after the event at the National Geographic Museum. ""I think of him and I can't complain about anything ... he was grateful and he had nothing and suffered everything."" The boy died a few months after she met him, Jolie said. According to a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees survey of displacement trends in 2008, there are 42 million uprooted people -- 15.2 million were refugees, 26 million were internally displaced people and 827,000 were asylum seekers. Afghans and Iraqis constituted almost half of all refugees worldwide. One out of four refugees was from Afghanistan, and 69 countries accepted Afghan refugees for asylum, agency officials found. Jolie recounted her meeting with a pregnant Afghan refugee. She lived in a small, roofless dirt house in an abandoned refugee camp in Pakistan and could not leave with the others because she was too far along in her pregnancy. Pakistan struggles with the largest refugee population in the world, about 1.8 million, according to the United Nations. The country also has more than 2 million internally displaced citizens, largely because of the fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban since April. Antonio Guterres, head of the U.N.'s refugee agency, elaborated on the plight of displaced people at the event. He said internally displaced people ""face the same plight [as refugees]. They have lost the same as refugees. They don't have the same international protections granted to refugees."" Conflicts like those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia have caused more people to flee their homes, though the number of displaced people declined by about 700,000 in 2008, the report said. Recent fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Somalia last year brought total displacement in each to 1.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively. More than 2 million internally displaced people were in Sudan's Darfur region, according to the report. When a genocide targeting Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 later spilled over into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rose Mapendo, a Tutsi, was caught in the middle. She spoke at the event and described her ordeal. Mapendo, her husband and seven children were thrown into a death camp, where her husband was executed and her children starved, she said through tears. While at the prison, she learned that she was pregnant. She gave birth in silence, on a concrete floor, Mapendo said. To her surprise, she had twins, and to her captors' surprise, she named her newborns after them. Soon after her gesture toward the prison commanders, her family was freed after their 16-month ordeal. Mapendo, named a CNN Hero in October, created Mapendo International, a nonprofit dedicated to identifying, saving and resettling endangered refugees. She was named humanitarian of the year at the event by the U.N. agency. ""I want to encourage the refugees don't give up,"" she said. Giving up ""is not an option.""

"(CNN) -- The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert's words, ""though understandable, were ill-advised and imprudent."" In a letter posted on the team's website Thursday, Gilbert called James' decision to play for the Miami Heat a ""cowardly betrayal"" and a ""shocking act of disloyalty."" James, who joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for his entire career, announced his decision to leave the team during a much-ballyhooed ESPN special Thursday entitled ""The Decision."" In a press conference which was posted on the NBA's website Monday, Stern said that James was ""certainly entitled"" to leave the team, but he would have advised the basketball star to handle his departure and announcement differently. ""I think that the advice that he received on this was poor. But his performance was fine. His honesty and his integrity I think shine through, but this decision was ill-conceived, badly produced and poorly executed,"" Stern said. Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert's letter showed a ""property-owner's mentality."" ""Equally imprudent I believe are the remarks by my good friend Jesse Jackson, which purport to make this into a racial matter... he really is mistaken,"" Stern said. Before deciding to join the Miami Heat, James, a reigning two-time NBA MVP, looked at several teams, including New York, Chicago and Cleveland. He said it came down to one thing. ""The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future."" James said. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison.","NBA fines Cavs owner $100,000 for comments .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- New data released Thursday suggests that the Arctic Ocean will be ""largely ice free"" during summer within a decade. As the Arctic sea ice melts, polar bears face extinction. The report, complied by the UK-based Catlin Arctic Survey and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is the latest research into ice thickness in the Arctic. Researchers predict that within 20 years ice cover will be completely gone during the warmer months. The expedition, which was completed in May, was led by UK explorer Pen Hadow. He and his team collected data by manually drilling into the ice and noting its thickness along a 450-kilometer route across the northern part of the Beaufort Sea. They found that the area surveyed was comprised almost exclusively of first year ice. Scientists think this is significant because traditionally the region has been made up of much older, thicker ice. ""Discovering this area of younger ice provides another body of information that supports the rapidly emerging scientific consensus that it's going to be nearer 10 years from now that we will see roughly 80-85 percent free waters in the Arctic Ocean,"" Hadow told CNN. Measurements taken by Hadow and his team report that the ice-floes were on average 1.8 meters thick -- which, according to scientists, is too thin to survive next summer's ice melt. Professor Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the UK's University of Cambridge said: ""With a large part of the region now first year ice, it is clearly more vulnerable. The area is now more likely to become open water each summer, bringing forward the potential date when the summer sea ice will be completely gone."" Professor Wadhams, who has analyzed the expedition data, added: ""The Catlin Arctic Survey data supports the new consensus view that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer within about 20 years, and much of that decrease will be happening within 10 years.""  Click here to see pictures of the expedition » . Martin Sommerkorn from the WWF International Arctic Program believes that the changes in sea-ice cover in the region are likely to increase global temperatures further. ""Such a loss of Arctic sea ice has recently been assessed to set in motion powerful climate feedbacks which will have an impact far beyond the Arctic itself,"" Sommerkorn said. ""Arctic sea ice holds a central position in our Earth's climate system. Take it out of the equation and we are left with a dramatically warmer world,"" he added. Hadow fears that the current climate models developed by scientists may not be extreme enough. But he is hopeful that this new data will spur world leaders into action. ""We are now in a loss period,"" Hadow told CNN. ""Maybe losing this sea ice, this roof on the top of our planet in going to be an important moment, a big visual aid to the science that in combination can bring about some sort of global agreement on emissions.""","New report says Arctic sea ice will largely disappear in summer within a decade .
