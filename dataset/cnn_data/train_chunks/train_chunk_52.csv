"(CNN) -- Paul Schaefer, a former Nazi who fled Germany in 1961 and founded a cult-like commune in Chile, died Saturday in a prison hospital. He was 88. Schaefer was serving a 20-year sentence at the national penitentiary in Santiago for sexually abusing children at the notorious commune known as Colonia Dignidad (The Dignity Colony). The commune in southern Chile, also called Villa Baviera, was created as a place to safeguard Germanic traditions. Under Schaefer's rule, contact with outsiders was largely forbidden. Some of Schaefer's crimes date to the 1970s and 1980s, during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who had visited the commune. Former members of the colony have admitted that human rights violations and sexual abuse of children occurred there, saying in a 2006 letter published in a leading Chilean newspaper that they were led by Schaefer's influence. Schaefer had been in prison since 2006 when he was extradited to Chile from Argentina, where he had been living in hiding. Schaefer died Saturday morning of cardiopulmonary arrest, the penitentiary said. CNN Chile's Christian Pino contributed to this report.","Former Nazi officer Paul Schaefer dies in Chile of cardiopulmonary arrest .

"(CNN) -- Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said Monday he won't appeal the six-game suspension imposed by the National Football League and apologized to his teammates and fans for a night out that left him under a Georgia prosecutor's microscope. ""Missing games will be devastating for me,"" Roethlisberger said in a statement issued through the team. ""I am sorry to let down my teammates and the entire Steelers fan base. I am disappointed that I have reached this point and will not put myself in this situation again."" Roethlisberger, who led the Steelers to Super Bowl titles in 2006 and 2009, faced the threat of criminal charges after a woman accused him of raping her in a Milledgeville, Georgia, bar during a night of drinking in March. The quarterback's lawyer said no sexual assault took place, and prosecutors decided earlier this month that they could not prove a crime had been committed. But NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell slapped the quarterback with a six-game suspension for ""conduct detrimental to the NFL"" last week, ordering him to undergo a ""comprehensive behavioral evaluation by medical professionals,"" follow their recommendations and ""avoid situations that can cause legal or other problems."" If Roethlisberger complies, the suspension could be cut to four games, or it could be extended if he doesn't, the league said. In his statement, Roethlisberger said the suspension imposed last week ""speaks clearly that more is expected of me,"" and he promised to ""make the necessary improvements"" in his behavior. ""Though I have committed no crime, I regret that I have fallen short of the values instilled in me by my family,"" he said. ""I will not appeal the suspension and will comply with what is asked of me -- and more."" The 28-year-old quarterback owns a home at a lake near Milledgeville, Georgia, about 115 miles southeast of Atlanta. Fred Bright, the district attorney in Milledgeville, told reporters at a news conference announcing the decision that Roethlisberger should ""grow up."" But he added, ""We do not prosecute morals. We prosecute crimes.""","Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback won't appeal six-game suspension .

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- A man who acted as a legal adviser to the American missionaries arrested on child kidnapping charges in Haiti is himself facing allegations of human trafficking in El Salvador and human smuggling charges in the United States. An international arrest warrant was issued Saturday for the legal adviser on sex-trafficking charges. Salvadoran police raided a home in May that turned up passports and an ID card in the names of both Jorge Torres Puello and his alias, Jorge Torres Orellana. Each of the documents bore photos of the same man. His wife was arrested in that raid and charged with sex trafficking, and her trial is pending. In a phone interview with CNN on Sunday, Jorge Torres Puello acknowledged he is the same man wanted by Salvadoran authorities. He denied the charges against him. Full coverage of the earthquake aftermath in Haiti . According to the warrant, Torres Puello is accused of running an international sex trafficking ring that lured women and girls from the Caribbean and Central America into prostitution with offers of modeling jobs. A wanted poster released by Interpol, the international police organization, includes crimes against children as one of the offenses that Torres Puello is being sought for. ""I never did anything,"" Torres Puello said Sunday. ""I started helping a Dominican pastor helping a lot of people who were stranded to get back to their home countries. We once gave some Nicaraguan and Costa Rican women some money to return home and instead they went to the authorities and put in a complaint against us. I never had anybody against their will."" Torres Puello also denied Salvadoran allegations that he ran a brothel out of his home with wife Ana Josefa Ramirez Orellana, who remains jailed pending trial, according to Salvadoran police. ""I want to clear the Salvador matter up and I am hiring a lawyer to do that,"" he said. ""I know I am innocent and I want to clear my past."" His mother, Soledad Puello, told CNN Sunday that she first heard of the Salvadoran accusations when her son called to tell her of his wife's arrest. She said her son told her he had known about the sex ring, but wasn't involved in it. Soledad Puello led CNN to believe that her son remained in the Dominican Republic, but she would not say where. Torres Puello, who said he was born in Yonkers, New York, in 1977 to a Dominican mother and a Puerto Rican father, also said he is wanted in the United States on charges of smuggling people between Canada and the United States, which he also denied. He said he spent 18 months in a Canadian jail pending what he called an unsuccessful extradition request by U.S. authorities. He has served jail time in the United States before, he said -- one year in 1998 for handling funds related to a drug-trafficking operation, and was jailed again briefly between late 2001 and January 2002 for violating parole. He denied the drug charge. Both his mother and Torres Puello say he served briefly in the U.S. Army in a military intelligence unit, and Torres Puello said he also worked undercover with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. A family photo shows Torres Puello in a military uniform alongside a truck with the words ""U.S. Military"" printed across the bumper. CNN was unable to reach government officials to confirm his claims of working with the military, the DEA and Homeland Security. Torres Puello's statements regarding the charges against him could not be immediately verified. But on Sunday, four men showed up at his mother's home while CNN reporters were present. The men said they were from the U.S. Embassy and looking for Torres Puello. One of the men told Soledad Puello that her son has three outstanding arrest warrants -- two in the United States and one in El Salvador. He did not specify the charges. One of the men was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""U.S. Marshals Service, Fugitive Task Force."" Torres Puello said he made contact with the Central Valley Church in Idaho and their family representatives and offered to provide legal assistance to the American missionaries shortly after they were jailed in January after trying to cross the Dominican border carrying 33 children without proper documentation. Family representatives in Idaho did not give the exact date when they were contacted by Puello but said it was ""shortly after their arrest"". Hiram Sasser, attorney with Liberty Legal of Plano, Texas, sought to distance his client, Jim Allen, from Torres Puello. He stated in an e-mail to CNN: ""No attorney has ever been authorized to represent Jim Allen other than our team, which includes Mr. Lissade. The only spokesperson for the Allen family has been me and our team."" Haitian attorney Louis Gary Lissade showed up at court in Port-au-Prince on February 9 to represent Allen, one of the 10 Americans. Another of Allen's U.S. defense team, Reginald Brown, said he, Sasser and other U.S. attorneys were only hired to represent Allen on Super Bowl Sunday -- nine days after the Americans were arrested. In a February 9 letter from Brown to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Brown stated: ""It's our understanding from press reports ... that all 10 Americans were represented by a single Haitian attorney. ... We're not able to confirm if that counsel was independently chosen by Jim [Allen]."" Until February 7, Torres Puello said he had been appointed legal adviser to all 10 Americans and Haitian attorney Edwin Coq said he was handling the case in Port-au-Prince on behalf of all 10. Coq, who was the attorney Brown referred to in his letter to Clinton, says he resigned on February 6 over a dispute about payments. Torres Puello said he had fired Coq. Torres Puello turned up at court Monday, February 8, saying he was there to organize legal representation for all 10 Americans after Coq left the case. Torres Puello said he read about the case and decided to offer his services for free. However, Torres Puello's stepfather, Franco Ceminara, said the arrested Americans' families had already wired more than $40,000 to his stepson. A receipt provided by Torres Puello's family to CNN showed the Haitian lawyers are charging $40,000 to represent the Americans. The receipt, for an advance payment of $10,000, was signed by Aviol Fleurant, one of the Americans' Port-au-Prince-based defense team that also includes Lissade. Family and church representatives in Idaho, where most of the 10 Americans are from, told CNN earlier in the week that they had not paid money to the man they know as Jorge Puello. Regarding the American missionaries, Torres Puello said: ""Prior to this earthquake I never knew those people [the Americans]. When I read about their case I just decided to help them. I'm in the real estate business and was working with a team of lawyers.""","Jorge Torres Puello acting as legal adviser to 10 Americans charged with kidnapping .

"(CNN) -- I wish the titans of Wall Street could meet Mark Dalton. Not that it would be likely to change anything. But I wish the leaders of Goldman Sachs and of the other big banking firms could talk to Mark Dalton for just a few minutes. They might learn a few things about how to better connect with the American people. I didn't know Dalton's last name until a few days ago. For almost two years, I've held onto something he mailed to me. There was no reason not to throw it out, yet I had a feeling that someday I'd want to refer to it. That day is now. With the public's wariness of Wall Street growing, with Goldman Sachs being accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (even as Goldman was announcing first-quarter profits of $3.46 billion, nearly twice as much as in the first quarter a year ago), with investors wondering if they're being given a fair shake by the firms to which they have entrusted their money, Mark Dalton's way of doing business might be worthy of at least a moment's attention. I came across him quite by chance. I occasionally purchase used books -- titles that have gone out of print. Sometimes I will place my orders through Amazon.com, which offers an online marketplace for local used-book merchants around the country. In 2008, I found a book I was looking for on that Amazon marketplace, and submitted an order. The price was more than reasonable: $6.95 for the used hardcover. Used books are not shipped by Amazon itself, but by the local booksellers. A week or so after I placed the order, the package arrived, from High View Books in Smithfield, Rhode Island. The book seemed to be in good shape. I was pleased. But with it was a personal letter to me. It said: . ""Thank your for your recent book order. I have enclosed a check to you for $2.95. The reason for this is that this book is only in 'Very Good' condition, while I mistakenly described it as being in 'Near Fine' condition in my listing. Please accept my apologies for the error. (Also, please note, the soiling that you see on the dust jacket is actually on the Mylar and not the dust jacket itself.)"" He wrote that he hoped his apology and the refund were satisfactory. Sure enough, tucked into the book was a check made out to me, for $2.95. I was surprised by the gesture. Yes, in his online listing for the book he had said it was in ""Near Fine"" condition, but who really knows what those designations mean? You see them all the time describing used books: ""Fair,"" ""Good,"" ""Very Good,"" ""Near Fine,"" ""Fine""-- they would seem to be approximations. I had no complaints about the condition of the book I had bought from him. If I had paid $6.95, and he had refunded $2.95, and Amazon had taken its commission, how was he supposed to make a living? I mailed his check back to him, thanking him for it and telling him how impressed I was with the way he did business. I told him I could not accept the refund. And for some reason, I couldn't toss the letter. It made me feel hopeful about certain things. With Wall Street losing people's confidence in recent days over the way it is alleged to treat its customers' money, I got the letter out again. He had just signed it ""Mark at High View Books""; I was able to find him in Smithfield, which is how I found out that he was Mark Dalton. He seemed as surprised to be hearing from me as I was when I had gotten his refund check. He's 42 years old; High View Drive is the street on which he lives, and his used books -- about 4,000 of them at last count -- are kept in his garage. Business, he said, is not so good. ""I'm pretty small-time,"" he said. ""When I first started doing this about three years ago, I was selling 15 or 20 books a day. But now, that's down to 15 or 20 books every few days."" He said that his wife is a schoolteacher; without her salary, he couldn't make it. He said he tries to run his business professionally and in good faith, but is finding that the results ""are pretty pathetic, dollar-wise."" I asked him the question that had been in the back of my mind since I first heard from him: As he was struggling to make a living, why, exactly, on my $6.95 order, had he decided to send me that refund check for $2.95? He couldn't have been making much of a profit on the order in the first place. ""I just try to do things right,"" he said. ""When I went to mail that book to you, I must have noticed that it wasn't in as good a condition as I had promised on my Amazon listing. I want my customers to be happy and to believe I'm being fair with them."" Such a simple proposition. Yet with the financial news we've become conditioned to reading about. . . . I asked Dalton if he had been following the recent reports from Wall Street. He said he had. ""I suppose if you're in charge of a multi-billion dollar bank -- billions in profits, millions in bonuses -- maybe you can lose sight of where you came from,"" he said. As for his own business: ""I know I'm doing it right in how I treat my customers, and that gives me peace of mind, but it's not generating the results I had hoped."" He said he is considering looking for some other kind of work. I thanked him again for that letter he had sent to me two years ago, and he thanked me again for remembering. By his own admission, as a businessman he lacks the killer instinct, the appetite for working the angles; he would undoubtedly be an abject failure on Wall Street. If only it weren't so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Wall Street is being accused of shady business practices .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York taxi driver pleaded guilty Friday to involvement in a plot to blow up crowded subway trains. After entering his plea Zarein Ahmedzay delivered a message: ""I strongly urge the American people to stop supporting the war against Islam,"" he said, adding, ""I am thankful for myself that I did not do anything to harm anyone but fear someone else will do the same thing."" Prosecutors said Ahmedzay and another man, Adis Medunjanin, conspired with Najibullah Zazi on the attack in mid-September 2009, which authorities thwarted. Zazi pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with authorities, investigators have said. Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty. During Ahmedzay's hearing, prosecutors for the first time revealed the names of the two al Qaeda leaders who, officials said, ordered the plot: Saleh al-Somali, head of international operations for al Qaeda, and Rashid Rauf, a key operative. U.S. officials said both al Qaeda figures were killed in drone in attacks in Waziristan, the tribal region along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Rauf was reported killed in a drone attack in Waziristan in November 2008; al-Somali was reported killed in December 2009, U.S. officials said. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a written statement, said the facts disclosed Friday ""add chilling details to what we know was a deadly plot hatched by al Qaeda leaders overseas to kill scores of Americans in the New York City subway system in September 2009. This plot, as well as others we have encountered, makes clear we face a continued threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates overseas."" ""Prosecution underscores the importance of using every tool we have available to both disrupt plots against our nation and hold suspected terrorists accountable,"" Holder said. Ahmedzay previously pleaded not guilty to making false statements to the FBI about the plot. But Friday, appearing before before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold in U.S. District Court, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use a weapon of mass of destruction against people in the United States; conspiracy to commit murder; and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Ahmedzay told the court that he, Zazi and a third man traveled to Pakistan in August 2008 to join jihadists fighting in Afghanistan, but they were turned away. But al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan told the group they would be more helpful to the jihad cause if they conducted suicide attacks in New York. ""We discussed the matter amongst ourselves, and we agreed to go forward with the plan,"" he said. ""I personally believed that conducting an operation in the United States would be the best way to end the wars."" At one point, Ahmedzay said, he began to have second thoughts but ultimately committed to the plan. He said his primary input was to develop targets because he was a taxi driver and knew the city well. Eventually, the three settled on an attack on subway trains during the month of Ramadan, but abandoned that plan when they believed law enforcement was watching them. Ahmedzay concluded his statement to the court with his belief that ""Zionist Jews"" are ""the real enemies of this country"" who are ""destroying this country from within"" and ""want a permanent shadow government within the government of the United States."" He faces a sentence of up to life in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced at the end of July. ""Ahmedzay's plea makes clear that he betrayed his adopted country and its people by providing support to al Qaeda and planning to bring deadly violence to New York,"" said FBI Director Robert S. Mueller in a written statement. Robert Gottlieb, attorney for Medunjanin, said Friday's developments do not change his client's plans to proceed to trial. ""The evidence and the facts as they pertain to him will come out in court,"" Gottlieb said. No trial date has been set for Medunjanin. CNN's Jennifer Rizzo, Susan Candiotti and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Zarein Ahmedzay pleads guilty to conspiracy, faces possible life sentence .

"(CNN) -- Mikkel Kessler is the new World Boxing Council (WBC) super-middleweight champion after out-pointing Briton Carl Froch in a bruising encounter in his native Denmark on Saturday night. Despite being previously unbeaten after 26 fights, the 32-year-old Froch never looked comfortable against his durable opponent, who was given the decision on all three of the judges scorecards after 12 brutal rounds in front of a partisan and passionate crowd at the MCH Messecenter in Herning. Froch had Kessler on the canvas in the fifth round, but the referee ruled that the Dane had slipped, and the challenger eventually wore the champion down with a combination of hooks and jabs to take the belt by a margin of 117-111, 115-113 and 116-112. The result means 31-year-old Kessler, who has lost just twice in 45 fights, is a world champion again just five months after losing his World Boxing Association (WBA) title to Andre Ward. Although gracious in defeat, Froch questioned if the decision would have gone Kessler's way if the fight had taken place in his hometown of Nottingham, England. ""I feel terrible that I lost my title, absolutely gutted,"" Froch told ringside reporters after the fight. ""I don't want to make a mockery of anything but I feel if it was at home in my town, the decision would have gone the other way."" He added: ""I took some big punches off a big puncher and I've got to give Kessler the credit he deserves. He stayed in there and is a strong, proud warrior.""","Mikkel Kessler defeats Carl Froch to win the WBC super-middleweight title .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bush administration lawyers who wrote ""torture"" memos have been cleared of allegations of professional misconduct after a Justice Department internal investigation, which recommends no legal consequences for their actions. The report by the Justice Department concludes the high-ranking lawyers who developed controversial legal guidance on waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques may have exercised poor judgment, but not professional misconduct. The conclusion resulted from a decision by top career Justice Department executive David Margolis to reverse a recommendation of investigators that found the two lawyers' legal memos did constitute professional misconduct. That tentative conclusion, which was overruled by Margolis, said the lawyers should be referred to their state bar associations for potential disbarment. But in the final report, the examination of the legal guidance written by Justice Department lawyers John Yoo and Jay Bybee found they did not constitute a professional breach that could have led to state disbarment. The report by the Justice Department ethics office, called the Office of Professional Responsibility, also examined and cleared attorney Steven Bradbury. He headed the Office of Legal Counsel, which provided legal guidance to the executive branch during President George W. Bush's second term. The often-delayed release of the report came late Friday after it was sent to lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary committees, who made the findings public. In addition to the content itself, the constantly delayed release of the politically sensitive report had become an issue. Issuance of the report was repeatedly postponed for more than a year, prompting lawmakers and civil liberties groups to press for publication of the investigation's findings. In November, Holder told Congress the report would be made public ""by the end of the month."" Reaction to the Justice Department investigation largely fell along party lines, with liberal Democrats unhappy with the conclusions, and highlighting criticism of the Bush Administration lawyers. ""While the report concludes the lawyers did not breach their minimal professional obligations, I certainly hold top lawyers at the Justice Department] to a higher standard than that, as all Americans should,"" said Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan. Conyers, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee focused on the lawyers' ""poor judgments,"" and said, ""Today's report makes plain that those memos were legally flawed and fundamentally unsound."" Meanwhile, conservative lawmakers applauded the decision not to recommend action against the Bush administration officials who proposed enhanced interrogation techniques. ""It is important that future government lawyers know that their efforts to protect Americans will not be criminalized by future administrations,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. ""We know that the decision of these attorneys to approve enhanced interrogation tactics in the wake of 9/11 saved lives,"" he declared.","DoJ: No professional misconduct by lawyers who wrote ""torture memos""

"Moscow, Russia (CNN)  -- Thousands of opposition demonstrators marched in front of the parliament building in Kiev, Ukraine, Saturday, protesting a deal reached earlier this week to extend Russia's military presence in the former Soviet Republic, national news media reported. Parliamentary opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko -- the former prime minister who lost to Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential election run-off in February -- told protesters Saturday that the ratification of the treaty must be prevented at all costs. She claimed that Yanukovych is ""selling out"" Ukraine, has ""openly embarked on the path of destruction of [Ukraine's] national interests, and has actually begun the process of eliminating the state's sovereignty,"" according to a transcript of the speech on her website. After the deal was signed Wednesday by Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Tymoshenko said it violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution, which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017. Saturday, protesters reportedly adopted a resolution calling the agreement an ""unprecedented act of national treason and disgrace,"" and calling on all opposition groups to unite against it. According to Tymoshenko's website, some 10,000 people gathered at the rally. But Ukrainian national news agency UNIAN estimated the number of protesters at 5,000. The deal extends Russia's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Ukraine, for an additional 25 years, in exchange for a 30 percent cut in the price of natural gas that Russia sells to Ukraine. The agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices, which culminated in Russia turning off the pipeline to Ukraine. The dispute affected not only Ukrainians, but many Europeans who depend on Russian gas pumped through Ukraine. The two countries had been at odds ever since the ""Orange Revolution"" swept Yanukovych's fiercely anti-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2005. Throughout his time in office, Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol. The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017. ""The prolongation of the Black Sea Fleet's presence in Sevastopol is essential to Russia,"" Yanukovych said Wednesday. ""We understand that the Black Sea Fleet will be one of the guarantors of security on the Black Sea."" The Kremlin-friendly Yanukovych, who hails from predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, trounced Yushchenko in national elections last January. The Russian president said the new deal added a ""concrete and pragmatic dimension"" to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians. Opposition groups in Ukraine, however, were quick to denounce the agreement. Yuschenko's ""Our Ukraine"" party said the treaty would lead to the ""Russification"" of Ukraine. Opposition activists decided Saturday to stage another protest in front of parliament April 27, when the deal will be put to a ratification vote. CNN's Ivan Watson and Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Opposition demonstrators march in Kiev protesting deal over Russian military presence .

"(CNN) -- The diabetes drug Avandia is linked with tens of thousands of heart attacks, and drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline knew of the risks for years but worked to keep them from the public, according to a Senate committee report released Saturday. The 334-page report by the Senate Finance Committee also criticized the Food and Drug Administration, saying that the federal agency that regulates food, tobacco and medications overlooked or overrode safety concerns found by its staff. ""Americans have a right to know there are serious health risks associated with Avandia and GlaxoSmithKline had a responsibility to tell them,"" said U.S. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat and committee chairman. ""Patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and GlaxoSmithKline abused that trust."" The bipartisan report also was signed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top-ranking Republican on the committee. GlaxoSmithKline rejected any assertions Saturday that the drug is not safe. ""We disagree with the conclusions in the report,"" company spokeswoman Nancy Pekarek told CNN. ""The FDA had reviewed the data and concluded that the drug should be on the market."" Seven clinical trials on the drug prove that it is not linked to heart attacks, Pekarek said. ""None of that data shows a statistically significant correlation between Avandia and myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction [heart attack],"" she said. Ischemia is a condition in which blood flow and oxygen are blocked from going to certain parts of the body. The Senate committee investigation stems from concerns that Avandia and other high-profile drugs put ""public safety at risk because the FDA has been too cozy with drug makers and has been regularly outmaneuvered by companies that have a financial interest in downplaying or under-exploring potential safety risks,"" the report states. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said she is waiting for the recommendations of an advisory committee that will hear reports on the drug this summer. ""Meanwhile,"" Hamburg said in a statement, ""I am reviewing the inquiry made by Senators Baucus and Grassley and I am reaching out to ensure that I have a complete understanding and awareness of all of the data and issues involved."" The Senate report was developed over the past two years by committee investigators who reviewed more than 250,000 pages of documents provided by GlaxoSmithKline, the FDA and several research institutes. Committee investigators also conducted numerous interviews and phone calls with GlaxoSmithKline, the FDA and anonymous whistleblowers. According to the Senate report: . • FDA scientists estimated in July 2007 that Avandia was associated with approximately 83,000 heart attacks since the drug came to market. ""Had GSK considered Avandia's potential increased cardiovascular risk more seriously when the issue was first raised in 1999 ... some of these heart attacks may have been avoided,"" the report states. • GlaxoSmithKline undertook attempts to undermine information critical of Avandia. ""GSK executives attempted to intimidate independent physicians, focused on strategies to minimize or misrepresent findings that Avandia may increase cardiovascular risk and sought ways to downplay findings that a competing drug might reduce cardiovascular risk,"" the report says. As an example, committee investigators say they found that GlaxoSmithKline experts verified an outside study showing the cardiac problem, but the company publicly attacked the findings as incorrect. • Two FDA safety officials sounded a clear alarm in October 2008 writing, ""There is strong evidence that rosiglitazone [Avandia] confers an increased risk of [heart attacks] and heart failure compared to pioglitazone [rival drug on market]."" They concluded and trials comparing the two would be ""unethical and exploitive."" Yet, the trial is still under way, the senators say. GlaxoSmithKline counters that the Senate report relies on outdated information. ""In essence, the report is a compilation of information and events that took place years ago,"" spokeswoman Pekarek said. ""There's no new data there."" The FDA has evaluated at the drug, Pekarek said, and updated product labeling in 2007 to say information on Avandia's relationship to myocardial ischemia is inconclusive. ""The FDA exists to ensure patient safety,"" she said. ""That is their purpose."" Avandia has been under scrutiny for years. The New England Journal of Medicine called the drug's safety into question in 2007. The Journal of the American Medical Association also questioned whether Avandia was safe in 2007. ""Among patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes, rosiglitazone use for at least 12 months is associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure, without a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality,"" the AMA journal wrote, adding that the ""findings have potential regulatory and clinical implications."" ""Regulatory agencies ought to re-evaluate whether rosiglitazone should be allowed to remain on the market,"" the report said. ""Health plans and physicians should not wait for regulatory actions. They should avoid using rosiglitazone in patients with diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular events, especially since safer treatment alternatives are available."" Read the report . In 2007, an FDA panel recommended by a vote of 22-1 that Avandia should remain on the market despite an analysis showing links to increased risk of heart attack. The vote was not binding, but a suggestion to FDA regulators. The panel also voted 20-3 at the same meeting in support of data that showed Avandia increased the risk of cardiac ischemia in patients with the most common type of diabetes. The Senate report does not address the issue of whether Avandia should be removed from the market.

"(CNN) -- When President Obama called for a world free of nuclear weapons in Prague, Czech Republic, this spring, many dismissed this part of his speech as idealistic rhetoric. But the abolition of nuclear weapons is not an unrealistic fantasy. It is a practical necessity if the American people are to have a secure future. President Obama should use his Nobel speech this week to reaffirm his commitment to this essential and obtainable goal. It is essential because a world armed with nuclear weapons is simply too dangerous for us to countenance. Since the end of the Cold War we have tended to act as though the threat of nuclear war had gone away. It hasn't. It is only our awareness of this danger that has faded. In fact, there are some 25,000 nuclear weapons in the world today; 95 percent of them are in the arsenals of the United States and Russia. Just this past weekend, the START treaty limiting the number of U.S. and Russian warheads expired. Negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland, have not yet been able to work out the details of a follow-up treaty. We must hope they will be able to agree to deep reductions. A recent study by Physicians for Social Responsibility showed that if only 300 of the weapons in the Russian arsenal attacked targets in American cities, 90 million people would die in the first half hour. A comparable U.S. attack on Russia would produce similar devastation. Further, these attacks would destroy the entire economic, communications and transportation infrastructure on which the rest of the population depends for survival. In the ensuing months the vast majority of people who survived the initial attacks in both countries would die of disease, exposure and starvation. The destruction of the United States and Russia would be only part of the story. An attack of this magnitude would lift millions of tons of soot and dust into the upper levels of the atmosphere, blocking out sunlight and dropping temperatures across the globe. In fact, if the entire Russian and U.S. strategic arsenals were involved in the fighting, average surface temperature worldwide would fall 10 degrees Centigrade to levels not seen on Earth since the depth of the last ice age 18,000 years ago. For three years there would not be a single day in the Northern Hemisphere free of frost. Agriculture would stop, ecosystems would collapse and many species, perhaps even our own, would become extinct. This is not just some theoretical scenario; it is a real and present danger. On January 25, 1995, we came within minutes of nuclear war when Russian military radar mistook a Norwegian-U.S. scientific rocket for a possible attack on Moscow. President Yeltsin, a man reportedly suffering from alcoholism and other major medical problems, was notified and given five minutes to decide how to respond. Then as now, both the United States and Russia maintained a policy of ""launch on warning,"" authorizing the launch of nuclear missiles when an enemy attack is believed to be under way. We don't know exactly what happened in the Kremlin that morning, but someone decided not to launch Russian missiles and we did not have a nuclear war. January 25, 1995, was five years after the end of the Cold War. There were no unusual crises anywhere in the world that day. It was a relatively good day in a time much less dangerous than our own. And we almost blew up the world. That was 15 years ago and the United States and Russia still maintain more than 2,000 warheads on high alert ready to be launched in 15 minutes and to destroy each other's cities 30 minutes later. Nuclear weapons are the only military threat from which U.S. armed forces cannot protect us. It is urgently in our national security interest to eliminate these instruments of mass annihilation from the arsenals of potential adversaries. If we have to get rid of our own nuclear weapons to achieve this, it is a deal well worth making. Make no mistake, the elimination of nuclear weapons is an attainable goal. These bombs are not some force of nature. They are the work of our hand. We built them and we can take them apart. Some governments falsely see these weapons as safeguards of their security. It will not be easy to convince them that true safety requires that we abolish them. Nor will it be easy to design the verification regime needed to assure that the weapons are dismantled and that no new weapons are built. Yet national security experts in the United States and around the world say that it can be done and it must be done. If politics is the art of the possible, then statesmanship is the art of the necessary. And if ever there was a time that cried out for statesmanship it is now. There are many important issues that demand our attention -- health care reform, energy policy, creating more jobs -- but none is as urgent as eliminating the threat of nuclear war. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ira Helfand.","Ira Helfand: Abolishing nuclear weapons is not an unrealistic fantasy .
Helfand: Threat of nuclear war still real, still terrifying and did not go away with the Cold War .
Helfand: About 25,000 nuclear weapons in world; 95 percent in U.S. and Russia .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Leaders of more than 30 Latin American and Caribbean nations are meeting in Mexico from Monday to launch a group that will serve as an alternative to the Organization of American States. The main difference between the OAS and the yet-to-be-named organization will be that the United States and Canada will not be members. Leaders of Latin American countries have been meeting almost every year since 1986 when the Rio Group was created by countries including Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. This year's summit is intended to take the Rio Group to a new level by creating the organization. Among the main topics to be discussed at the summit is whether to recognize Porfirio Lobo as the legitimate president of Honduras. Lobo, who took office in late January, was elected under a de facto government that resulted from a coup in June against then-president Manuel Zelaya. The ousted leader was then forced out of the country. Other topics on the agenda include the creation of a long-term plan to help Haiti recover from the devastating effects of the earthquake and Argentina's conflict with Great Britain over oil drilling offshore from the Falkland Islands. The Unity Summit of Latin America and the Caribbean will be held in Cancun.","Leaders from more than 30 nations meet at regional summit in Cancun .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- As natural habitats disappear in South Africa, baboons and humans are increasingly coming into close contact, and conflict. In South Africa's Cape Peninsula there has been a large-scale transformation of wild baboons' natural habitat into land for housing, industry and agriculture, according to the University of Cape Town Baboon Research Unit. The result is that wild baboons are surrounded by humans, which the researchers say is causing human-baboon conflict to escalate. But the problem isn't confined only to the Cape, as baboons are increasingly venturing into towns and villages across southern Africa in search of food, often leaving a trail of damage in their wake. In the farming village of Barrydale, a four-hour drive from Cape Town, baboons are a growing problem. While some local farmers say they want to shoot baboons found in the village, others favor a more sustainable solution. Report: Central African gorillas may go extinct . Jenny Trethowan, of advocacy group Baboon Matters, is known as the ""Baboon Lady"" back in Cape Town. She has spent her career trying to protect the primates in the Cape Peninsula, of which there are more than 400. In Barrydale, she sees an opportunity to tackle the problem before it gets out of hand. ""What is so exciting about the Barrydale scenario is the fact that they are being extremely proactive,"" Trethowan told CNN. ""In many of the other areas it's been a long time, where baboons have become habituated and trained. Now in Barrydale they are saying 'let's stop this behavior quickly before it gets started,' and that's enormously exciting for me."" Trethowan has pinned her hopes on implementing a baboon-monitoring program in the village. At the Joshua Baboon Rehabilitation Project, just outside Barrydale, Baboon Matters is training locals to be baboon monitors. The monitors are tasked with patrolling Barrydale and herding baboons away from homes and farms. ""If we can get the monitoring program going quickly before the baboons are habituated I believe we stand a good chance of success here,"" said Trethowan. Nola Frazier runs the Joshua Baboon Rehabilitation Project and supports the village's monitoring program. ""I don't think the baboon problem is going to go away,"" Frazier told CNN. ""It's a learning curve. It's something that's happening here; it's happening all over South Africa."" An existing monitoring program on the Cape is yielding benefits. Statistics from the Baboon Research Unit show human-induced injuries to baboons are at their lowest for five years. Deaths are also down, and the baboon population is up, which means encounters with humans are more likely. African football academy creates future stars . When she's not helping to run monitoring programs, Trethowan takes tourists on walks around the Cape Peninsula to see baboons in what she hopes will be their natural habitat. But despite the monitors' best efforts, the baboons sometimes stray from their natural environment. The smell of cooking, and windows left open, are practically an invitation to hungry baboons, whose food raids can result in damage to property. ""When I take people to walk, I never describe baboons as something they are not,"" said Trethowan. ""They do cause incredible damage, and the ideal thing would be for them to be on the mountain and not in the village. ""The monitors can struggle without a doubt. What's frustrating to me is to see the residents make little effort to help the monitors. If they were working with the monitors more, the monitors would be more efficient."" When it comes to taking on one of the continent's most opportunistic animals, researchers and advocates say there are no easy answers. ""Baboons are definitely incredibly opportunistic and incredibly adaptable, so from a management point of view it makes it incredibly difficult,"" said Trethowan. But she said it's these same characteristics that drew her into a life of advocacy for baboons. ""It is hugely amazing to watch how these baboons will adapt to a situation and will seize an opportunity and work with whatever they've got,"" she told CNN. ""I think we've got a lot to learn from them, in hopes of showing more people the positives in an animal so often labeled a problem.""

"(CNN) -- While the horrors inflicted by the Nazis during World War II are well documented, ""Defiance"" director Edward Zwick wanted to make sure the stories of those who fought back aren't overlooked. Liev Schreiber, left, and Daniel Craig play freedom fighters in ""Defiance."" ""There is this misperception that the Jews only went willingly to the slaughter,"" Zwick said. ""And in fact, the new history and scholarship tells us that there was so much resistance. This is just one instance."" His new film, which goes into wide release Friday, tells the tale of the three Bielski brothers, who led a Jewish resistance group after escaping into the woods of Belarus in Eastern Europe. The movie stars Daniel Craig -- best known for his work as the latest James Bond -- Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell as the trio who took up arms against the Nazis and helped save the lives of more than 1,000 Jewish refugees fleeing occupied Poland. Portraying a slice of Jewish history was somewhat familiar territory for Craig, who plays brother Tuvia Bielski in the movie. He also co-starred as an Israeli agent in Steven Spielberg's ""Munich,"" the dramatization of the murder of 11 athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics. Craig said the characters' religion had nothing to do with his interest; both roles were just fascinating parts that attracted him. ""I think someone said, 'You did something similar to that in 'Munich,' "" he recalled. ""I said, well it's kind of not. It's a different period in history and I don't think religion is something that should hold me back.""  Watch Craig talk about the movie's power » . Schreiber, who is Jewish, said bringing the story of the heroic yet complex brothers to the big screen gave him ""a sense of pride"" and he found inspiration in their bravery. ""It was in these guys' DNA,"" said Schreiber, who plays Zus Bielski. ""But I also think that it is in our DNA as human beings ... that courage exists, that passion exists, that tenacity to love exists. It's just that we don't experience the kinds of tests nowadays that they did in the 1930s in Eastern Europe -- particularly if you were Jewish."" Filming in Lithuania just across the border from Belarus added an element of realism to the role, Schreiber said. ""We shot in the woods in the middle of winter, but I think as an actor you're always grateful of these little reminders of where you are and what you're doing, especially when you're doing something on film when it's so naturalistic,"" he said. ""When your hands are frozen and you can barely load a machine gun then you know you're on to something with the character."" Jamie Bell, best known for playing the title role in ""Billy Elliot,"" rounds out the cast as younger brother Asael Bielski. He said the bleak setting helped him understand ""the minutiae of what these people actually went through."" Bell had considered himself pretty knowledgeable about the Holocaust and World War II before learning about the project. ""But when I read the script I felt kind of embarrassed that I didn't know about the Bielski brothers and about the Jewish resistance across the board,"" he said. Heralding the triumph of the Bielski brothers to those who are unaware is just what director Zwick had in mind. He also had a hand in writing the ""Defiance"" screenplay and is no stranger to heroes in history, having directed the critically acclaimed ""Glory."" With this new film, Zwick said he found inspiration in the courage displayed by the Bielskis, who were fighting against incredible odds. ""You know, that's what's beautiful about their story,"" he said. ""They were unprepared. They were unsophisticated; nothing they had ever done would have led one to expect that they were capable of this. I think that speaks to all of us: what we are able to find within us that is fine, even magnificent within ourselves when called upon.""

"(CNN) -- Kajal Kumar knows the value of a good education. She's a career woman who poured years of her life into studying to become a certified public accountant with an MBA. But after nearly two decades climbing the corporate ladder in New York, the 46-year-old stopped managing employees and began micromanaging her two daughters. Instead of overseeing company accounts, Kumar organizes piano lessons, SAT preparation courses and Advanced Placement class homework assignments. She wants to give her daughters a shot at a top-notch college education. ""I had a very good, promising career,"" Kumar said. ""But it wasn't as important as making sure my kids did well and just setting them up for the future."" Stay-at-home parenting is nothing new. About 5.1 million mothers stay at home full time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. But Kumar's decision to quit her job came at an unconventional time -- when her children were grown teenagers and had entered high school. Unlike maternity leave, think of Kumar's time off as a college-prep leave, say college admissions counselors. She represents a group of highly educated mothers who are sacrificing careers to usher their children through the increasingly competitive college admissions process. There are no statistics counting how many mothers compromise their careers to help their teens with college admissions, but college counselors say they've witnessed more cases of mothers pausing their jobs or completely quitting their jobs. Over the past five years, Jeannie Borin, president of College Connections, says she saw a 10 percent uptick in mothers who quit or postponed their career to get their teens into college. Her counseling company offers services in 32 states. These mothers, who can afford to quit their jobs, may stop working for months, a year or several years leading up to the admission process, say researchers and college admissions counselors. They reduce their full-time hours to part time or request a temporary leave. Because many of them have jobs that require advanced degrees and specific skills, it's usually easier for them to transition back into the work force. ""They know it's going to be an intense year and they take a leave to that effect,"" Borin said. ""The college frenzy has affected the entire family."" Since the mid-1990s, there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of time college-educated mothers are spending with their older children, according to a March study from the University of California, San Diego. Women spent six hours a week on child care in the mid-1990s, but that number jumped to about 12 hours a week after 2005, the study said. Economics professors Garey and Valerie Ramey, who headed the UCSD study, theorized the rising amount of time spent on child care by a parent likely is associated with difficulty in the college admission process and juggling college preparatory activities. They found that college-educated parents have more resources and are better equipped to help their children with the process. ""We were shocked to find other mothers who had graduate degrees and had given up their careers and devoted their time to their children,"" said Valerie Ramey. The panic of getting her 17-year-old daughter into a highly ranked university hit Rebecca Marder hard. Marder, 56, of Los Angeles, California, holds two master's degrees in counseling that took her nearly 5½ years to earn. But a year-and-a-half ago, during daughter's junior year in high school, she put her private counseling practice on hold to help her through the college application process. Junior year is a crunch time for high schoolers, as they compile college wish lists and tour campuses. She became her daughter's college applications manager, scheduling campus tours and researching academic programs. She also became a videographer, recording her 17-year-old at each college visit as she weighed the pros and cons in front of each school. Marder has three older children, ages 25, 23, and 19, but she said this is the first time she stopped working, because she saw that expectations of high school students had grown since her eldest child entered college. Marder said it is a dilemma. ""We can be seen by others and, more importantly, by ourselves, as 'irresponsible' for not taking an active role in our child's application process, or as driven and overprotective if we do get involved."" She was relieved to learn this month that her daughter had been accepted by her top choice, New York University. She immediately reopened her practice, which was crucial, she said, because she had gone into debt during her time off. Managing a child's college application process can be similar to a corporate job, says Hilary Levey, a fellow at Harvard University who specializes in family studies. Levey conducted dozens of interviews with mothers who stopped working and stayed at home for their children. She says she talked to mothers who used their Blackberry devices to organize schedules and help their teens craft resumes. ""Raising the child sometimes becomes a career in itself,"" Levey said. ""Instead of getting a promotion and measuring progress in professional sense, a way to measure how well you are doing is how well your child is doing."" But guiding a teen is a very different experience than raising a newborn or young child, say some mothers who have given up their advanced degrees to become full-time moms. Several moms say their decision to stay at home with their teens as allowed them to strengthen those relationships. Cherie Rodgers, 57, of Santa Monica, California, found herself sharing special moments with her daughter when the stress of writing essays became too daunting. Together, they would take a break and enjoy an episode of a reality TV show together. ""If I had to do it all over again, I would do the same thing,"" said Rodgers, who put her career in family law on hold for four months last fall. She said she considers her decision a success: Her daughter is juggling admissions offers from four selective colleges. Even so, she said, her daughter probably could have gotten through the process without her. For Kajal Kumar in New York, her relationship with her college-bound high school senior also deepened. Kumar does miss getting dressed up for work and commuting into bustling Manhattan, but her decision has eased the stress on her family. Her husband continues to work. ""We wanted to make sure we could give her all the tools she needed to succeed,"" Kumar said. Her eldest daughter is headed to Vanderbilt University this fall. But the family's college admissions process will start all over again when the youngest daughter, who is in high school, begins eyeing colleges. And Kumar will be staying at home.","Some moms with advanced degrees are quitting their jobs to help their teens get into college .

"(CNN) -- The Oklahoma Senate voted Tuesday to override the governor's vetoes and pass two strong anti-abortion measures. One law requires women to undergo an ultrasound examination and listen to a description of what it shows before getting an abortion. Senate President Pro Tempore Glenn Coffee, a Republican, said Tuesday's vote shows lawmakers listened to Oklahoma's residents and ""made a bold statement in support of the sanctity of life."" But Democratic Gov. Brad Henry has called the legislation ""an unconstitutional attempt by the Oklahoma legislature to insert government into the private lives and decisions of its citizens."" Henry vetoed the bill and another abortion-related measure Friday, but the state House on Monday overwhelmingly voted to override both vetoes, with House Speaker Chris Benge, a Republican, lauding his colleagues for moving quickly. The Senate's 36-12 vote Tuesday was the final step required to make the bills laws . ""Those who rallied behind this cause reflected the core values of Oklahoma citizens, and I applaud my colleagues in providing more safeguards for the life of the unborn,"" Coffee said. Henry said he was disappointed by Tuesday's vote. ""It signals the beginning of another costly and possibly futile legal battle for the state of Oklahoma. Both laws will be challenged and, in all likelihood, overturned by the courts as unconstitutional,"" he said. ""I fear this entire exercise will ultimately be a waste of taxpayers' time and money."" In a statement issued after his vetoes Friday, Henry sharply criticized the laws. ""State policymakers should never mandate that a citizen be forced to undergo any medical procedure against his or her will, especially when such a procedure could cause physical or mental trauma,"" Henry said. ""To do so amounts to an unconstitutional invasion of privacy."" Henry said one of the flaws of the ultrasound bill was that it lacked an exemption for rape and incest victims. Henry vetoed similar legislation in 2008. His veto was overridden. The State Supreme Court struck down the legislation because it contained multiple subjects, a violation of the state Constitution requiring measures to deal with a single subject, Bennett said. The Center for Reproductive Rights said it had filed a lawsuit challenging the new law after Tuesday's Senate vote. ""Oklahoma has now passed the most burdensome ultrasound law in the country,"" Nancy Northup, the organization's president, told CNN. ""Until Oklahoma stops harassing women who are seeking abortions, we will continue to sue the state on these unconstitutional restrictions."" Coffee said challenging the new laws in court would go against what Oklahoma residents want. ""The voice of the people has spoken twice now this session in the Senate and twice in the House, and I sincerely hope those who would reverse the people's voice would think twice before acting,"" he said. The other measure approved by legislators Tuesday prohibits pregnant women and their families from seeking legal damages if physicians ""knowingly and negligently"" withhold key information or provide inaccurate information about their pregnancies. Henry, in opposing the bill, said it would be ""unconscionable to grant a physician legal protection to mislead or misinform a pregnant woman in an effort to impose his or her personal beliefs on his patient."" Such an issue would be particularly relevant to fetuses with disabilities. ""By prohibiting recovery of damages in wrongful birth and life malpractice actions, the legislation would allow unscrupulous, reckless or negligent physicians to knowingly withhold information or negligently provide inaccurate information to pregnant women without facing the potential of legal consequences,"" the governor said. The House voted to override the veto of the ultrasound bill by an 81 to 14 vote, well above the three-fourths majority required. State Rep. Lisa Billy, a Republican, said the bill ""does nothing more than give women as much information as possible before they make the life-altering decision to have an abortion."" ""I don't want a single woman to go through the lifelong torture of having an abortion without having all the relevant information,"" Billy said. The House voted 84 to 12 to override the veto over the legal damages prohibition. State Rep. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said the bill ""simply states that a doctor cannot be sued based on the opinion after birth that a child would have been better off if he or she had been aborted."" ""A bipartisan coalition of members supported this bill the first time, and I am pleased they did again today,"" Sullivan said. Benge, the House speaker, said, ""We must move to stop the degradation of human life seen in recent years and stand up for those who cannot defend themselves."" CNN's Joe Sterling and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","One law requires ultrasound, listening to description of what it shows before abortion .

"(CNN) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Monday deflected concerns that the state's new immigration law will hurt economic development, saying many businesses have long wanted tougher action. The new law requires Arizona police to determine whether people are in the United States legally if there is a reason to suspect they aren't. Brewer signed the controversial legislation into law on Friday. ""The bottom line is that when I go about meeting with businesses that come into Arizona ... they want to know that we have a safe and secure environment into which to move their businesses here,"" Brewer said at an Arizona Town Hall event in Tucson. ""They want to know that their employees are going to have a quality of life that they've had in the places where they're moving from to move here."" ""I believe it's not going to have the kind of economic impact that some people think that it might,"" Brewer, a Republican, said. Would you boycott Arizona over immigration law? The law, scheduled to go into effect 90 days after the close of the state's legislative session, would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times. Previously, officers could check someone's immigration status only if that person was suspected in another crime. Critics say the law could foster racial profiling and prompt businesses, conventions and tourists to stay away from the state. The bill has prompted rallies by opponents and supporters, and some prominent politicians in Washington and Arizona have criticized the measure, including Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, who has said he'll file a lawsuit to block the law. People have been protesting the bill outside the state Capitol since Friday, CNN affiliate KTVK reported. ""People are going to be stopped just because of the color of [their] skin. And it ain't right,"" protester Jose Acosta told CNN on Sunday. ""Are they going to be looking for Europeans as well, or is it just the brown people?"" Supporters say the measure is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce its own immigration laws. In Tucson on Monday, Brewer said she has written to the federal government five times about the issue in the past year and a half. ""[The letters] have been met with complete, total disrespect to the people of Arizona. I mean, we don't even get an answer back from our letters in regard to securing our border,"" Brewer said. ""So, given that, I think it was time that Arizonans did step up, and that was one reason why I think that [the new state legislation] was signed."" Brewer emphasized an executive order she issued last week to accompany the law will require additional training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling. ""I want you all to know that racial profiling is illegal. It's the law,"" she said Monday. ""We are going to be very diligent, and we're going to make absolutely sure that that law ... will be implemented properly and respectfully."" Gordon, Phoenix's mayor and a Democrat, said his office hopes the City Council will authorize the city to file a lawsuit Tuesday. ""Convention [and] tourist business groups have already gotten dozens of calls. We're pleading with them not to boycott Phoenix or the state because of [the bill],"" Gordon said Monday on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""There will be court challenges. I'm confident that the federal courts will enjoin it at least until it is determined [whether it's] constitutional and how to enforce it so that officers don't get sued by individuals alleging civil rights violations."" President Obama last week called the legislation ""misguided"" and said the federal government must act on the immigration issue. ""Our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona, which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe,"" the president said in Washington at a naturalization ceremony for 24 members of the military.

"(CNN) -- World number one Roger Federer has crashed out in the second round of the clay-court Rome Masters event, losing in three sets to unseeded Latvian Ernests Gulbis. The top seed looked set to cruise through after taking the opening set, but Gulbis fought back in the next two sets and, despite wasting six previous match points, the world number 40 eventually went through 2-6 6-1 7-5 in a match littered with unforced errors. Federer, who will defend his French Open title at Roland Garros next month, looked woefully out of form and made under 50 per cent of his first serves as he slumped to defeat in just over two hours. The win continued Gulbis' impressive 2010, which has seen him claim his first ever ATP Tour title at Delray Beach in February. ""It's incredible, I was shocked after the match, it's a great feeling: indescribable,"" Gulbis told reporters. It was Federer's first opening round loss at the Foro Italico since losing to Andrea Gaudenzi in 2002 -- and the first time since the 2000 Monte Carlo Masters that the Swiss maestro had lost his first clay-court match of the season. ""I hope I can bounce back, it's usually what I do after a loss like this,"" said Federer. ""When you lose, you understand how difficult it is to dominate this Tour. ""This knockout format is brutal -- one week you are great and the next week you are terrible,""  Federer told reporters. There were no such problems for second seed and 2008 champion Novak Djokovic, who took under an hour to demolish Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-1 6-1. And fourth seed Andy Murray also cruised through, easing to a 6-2 6-4 victory over home favorite Andrea Seppi.

"(The Frisky) -- Actress Amanda Seyfried has been pretty candid about her disdain for dieting.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder David Beckham has revealed he is set to miss the entire Major League Soccer (MLS) season with the Achilles injury that ended his 2010 World Cup dream. The former England captain has said he will not be able to start running on his ankle for another three months, and is now targeting a November return. ""I won't be running for another three months so I won't be playing again until probably November,"" Beckham told American broadcaster ABC. With the U.S. season set to reach its conclusion on November 21, it looks unlikely that the 34-year-old will feature for the Galaxy this term. While Beckham accepts his injury needs time to heal, he admitted there is a temptation to push along his recovery. ""This is an injury that's going to take time to heal,"" he said to MLSsoccer.com. ""I started therapy 10 days ago and I'm just doing that everyday. I kind of want to push it, but with this kind of injury you can't. You just have to wait for it to heal and move on."" The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star also spoke of his frustration at having to wear a protective boot, or use crutches, at all times. ""If I haven't got the boot on, which I didn't today for a few interviews, I have to use crutches,"" said Beckham. ""It's either one or the other at the moment, which is a pain. It's not easy moving around but I have to protect it."" Beckham sustained the injury last month while playing on loan for Italian giants AC Milan, shattering his hopes of playing in a fourth consecutive World Cup finals for England. It led to speculation that the former Manchester United star would retire, but he clearly remains determined to return to action after having surgery on the injury.","David Beckham has revealed he is set to miss the entire MLS season .

"(CNN) -- Famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who died on Thursday at the age of 71, was one of opera's most adaptable and ebullient performers, appearing on stage with singers as varied as Dame Joan Sutherland, U2's Bono and Liza Minnelli. Much as the star power of Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov revived widespread interest in classical ballet in the 1970s and 1980s, Pavarotti's beaming charisma and bravura style captured the attention of the late-20th-century audience for opera. Widely considered the greatest tenor of his time, Pavarotti began his life modestly in Modena, the son of Fernando, a baker and amateur singer, and Adele, who worked at the local tobacco factory. ""I dreamed to become a singer when I was four and I hear my father singing in the church with a beautiful tenor voice,"" he told CNN in a 1991 interview. ""And I say to myself, well, let's try to do something."" The young Pavarotti -- who played soccer with his town's junior team -- joined the church choir with his father and traveled with him to Wales, where the singing group won first prize at the Llangollen International singing competition. Although the experience left Pavarotti enthralled with singing, he graduated from the local teaching institute in 1955 and taught elementary school for two years, then worked as an insurance salesman. He continued his vocal studies, however, working first with with Arrigo Pola and then with Ettore Campogalliani. Then, in 1961, Pavarotti won the prestigious Concorso Internazionale and made his operatic debut at the Reggio Emilia Theater as Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's ""La Boheme."" His fame spread throughout Italy and then throughout the European continent as he made his international debut in Giuseppe Verdi's ""La Traviata"" in Belgrade. When Dame Joan Sutherland brought him on-stage with her during a performance of Gaetano Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" with the Greater Miami Opera in 1965, Pavarotti began his American career. He debuted at New York's Metropolitan Opera House three years later, and eventually marked 379 performances there, including his final opera, Puccini's ""Tosca"" in 2004, in which he performed as the painter Mario Cavaradossi. In between Pavarotti sold millions of records and raised millions of dollars for charity through benefit concerts, often sharing the stage with pop stars as well as other opera singers. Of his recordings, 1990's ""The Essential Pavarotti"" was the first classical album to reach No. 1 on Britain's pop charts, where it remained for five weeks. 1994's ""The Three Tenors in Concert,"" with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras, remains the best selling classical album of all time. Pavarotti joined with Domingo and Carreras in 1990, and although critics complained that Pavarotti's vocal skills were waning, the trio performed together for 14 years. Among his charities were a 1995 ""Concert for Bosnia"" that raised $8.5 million and other concerts that raised $3.3 million for refugees from Afghanistan and $1 million for refugees from Kosovo. In artistic terms, Pavarotti brought to the stage a voice neatly suited to the traditional bel canto, or ""beautiful singing"" style, essential to 17th-century Italian opera. As much about intensity as pitch, bel canto focuses the voice, concentrating the sound with both outstanding warmth and agility. So demanding is this work even of the best singers that Pavarotti in concert recital could be seen rising to the balls of his feet during the most challenging passages. A long, white handkerchief always hung from one hand as he sang, his eyebrows arched high in the effort, forming an expression seemingly of surprise at his own success. From his small beginnings, Pavarotti rose to great heights, performing in front of 500,000 people in New York's Central Park -- a concert seen by millions on television -- and before another 300,000 at Paris' Eiffel Tower. He won countless awards and honors -- including five Grammies -- and was named United Nations Messenger for Peace by then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He launched an international competition, The Pavarotti International Voice Competition, in 1982. He even founded a teaching facility for young singers in his home town. His signature aria, Puccini's ""Nessun Dorma"" from ""Turandot,"" was chosen as the theme music for the 1990 soccer World Cup, hosted by Italy. He also performed the aria at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. The great singer was also known as an equestrian expert, organizing one of the international show jumping circuit's most important competitions, the Pavarotti International, in Modena. Coinciding with that event, Pavarotti also staged an annual charity concert, Pavarotti and Friends. The portly singer retired from staged opera in 2004, but was on a ""farewell tour"" of concerts when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2006 and underwent emergency surgery to remove the tumor. Although the remaining concerts of his tour were canceled, his management said that he hoped to resume the tour in 2007. When cancer finally stopped Pavarotti from singing, it was only the second interruption of his career. ""I think I just stopped for one year when from a kid I become a man and the voice is changing,"" he said in 1991. ""I was an alto and became a tenor and that is the only time I think I remember to have stopped singing. Otherwise I have sung all my life."" E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- One of the great headaches of the American dream is about to get less painful. The road to college promises to be a little easier with the coming shorter FAFSA forms. Millions of parents and students will have much shorter federal applications for financial aid to pay for college. The form, known as FAFSA, is infamous for its detail and is considered by critics to be more painful and complex than a tax return. The Department of Education plans to unveil a shorter FAFSA on Wednesday, cutting out more than a quarter of the questions and slashing the online version from 30 screens down to just 10. And in a partnership with the Internal Revenue Service, many families will be able to automatically download their tax data into online FAFSA forms starting in January. Education Secretary Arne Duncan is expected to announce those changes for the 2010-2011 school year at the daily White House briefing Wednesday, along with a proposal for Congress to cut even more bulk from the FAFSA . In a statement obtained by CNN Radio, the Obama appointee linked the slash in paperwork to the administration's economic push. ""We have to educate our way to a better economy,"" Duncan said. ""Young people and adult learners deserve the chance to go to college and to know the money they need is available."" The changes to the FAFSA are often commonsense, dropping obscure specifics that affect few students' status, such as ""special combat pay."" Likewise, the agency is cutting through queries dripping in bureaucrat-ese. For example, the question, ""At any time... did your high school or school district homeless liaison determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?"" will instead be, ""Are you homeless?"" The FAFSA overhaul has been a long time in the making. Last year, Democrats in Congress pushed through student loan reforms that included some requirements for shorter, more user-friendly versions of FAFSA. One of the captains of that effort, House Education and Labor Chairman George Miller, D-California, is ready for more. In a statement, Miller said he looks forward to working with Duncan, ""to make college more affordable by making student loans more reliable, effective and efficient for families and taxpayers."" Duncan will need Miller's help. The education chief wants Congress to cut out a number of questions that either affect very few students or are impossible to verify, including a particularly stress-inducing series about parental assets. In addition to lowering blood pressure during student loan season, the effort could save countless hours of work. According the Department of Education, some 15 million parents and students trudge through the FAFSA every year, as a required step toward scholarships, grants and loans.","FAFSA has been dreaded for its complexity and length .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is changing a generations-old policy banning pilots from taking antidepressants, saying the new policy will improve safety by bringing to the surface pilots who either ignore signs of depression or lie about their use of medication for fear of losing their licenses to fly. Beginning Monday, pilots with mild to moderate depression will be allowed to fly while taking antidepressants if they can demonstrate they have been satisfactorily treated for at least 12 months. The FAA also will begin a six-month amnesty period, during which pilots who use antidepressants can step forward without fear of penalties. The pilots will be grounded until they can demonstrate they have been stable for a year, although those who can prove a history of successful medical treatment should be able to fly ""within a few months,"" the FAA said. The new policy will ""absolutely"" improve safety, said Randy Babbitt, head of the FAA and a former airline pilot and union chief. ""The concern that we have today is we have people who are either self-medicating or not seeking a diagnosis. Either of those is unacceptable,"" Babbitt said. ""This change ... will allow those people to get the treatment, allow us to monitor and return them to the cockpit [as] safer, better pilots."" FAA officials said that they do not know the extent of depression among pilots but that pilots are probably representative of the larger population, in which 10 percent are believed to suffer from depression. Nor does the FAA know how many pilots have removed themselves from flying status because they suffer from depression, a condition that now bars them from flying. Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy. Commercial pilots under the age of 40 are required to undergo a medical exam by an FAA-certified physician every year; those over 40, every six months. But the examination focuses largely on the pilots' physical health, and there is no formal assessment of the pilots' mental health. The FAA says pilots have a regulatory duty and professional responsibility to not fly if they know they have a physical or mental condition that makes them unsafe to fly. But the FAA concedes pilots aren't always forthcoming, especially if honesty could cost them their job. ""We know that there are people out there who are not taking antidepressants because they know they would be grounded if they are. We know there are people out there who are taking them and lying to us about that,"" said Dr. Fred Tilton, the FAA's federal air surgeon. ""We think it's safer to [make sure pilots are treated for depression] than to continue to drive it underground,"" he said. Under the new policy, the FAA will, on a case-by-case basis, issue special medical certificates to pilots who take one of four antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro). All four drugs can be used safely without side effects, the FAA said, and other medications will be considered as the agency gains experience and data under its new policy. FAA officials say that they have been studying the issue for a decade, and that the change comes with improvements in medication and as the stigma of depression has diminished. One of the concerns is the risk of suicide by airplane. Between 1993 and 2002, there were 16 ""aircraft-assisted suicides,"" according to a National Transportation Safety Board report, as recounted in a recent FAA medical bulletin. All involved smaller aircraft. In addition, the NTSB ruled that in 1999, the pilot caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 by forcing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean, although the board could not determine the pilot's motives and did not use the term ""suicide."" The pilot's medical certificate had been renewed 10 days before the crash. All 217 on board were killed. ""Depression is a disease, and it's treatable just like any other disease. And there is a stigma out there that we want to remove. We want to make the skies safer, and we believe that this change in the policy will benefit that and achieve that,"" Babbitt said. Said Tilton: ""We believe it's the right thing to do. We also have support from all of the scientific organizations that understand the treatment of depression and the safety of the airspace."" The new policy is consistent with recommendations from a host of aviation and medical organizations, including the Aerospace Medical Association, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the Air Line Pilots Association, the FAA said. Babbitt acknowledged that pilots face some risk by stepping forward, but he said they also face risk if they don't. ""If it [unauthorized use of medication] was ever discovered, it would be the end of their license and their career, period,"" he said. The FAA said the policy is being posted on the Federal Register, where the public can make comments until May 3. Officials said because it is changing a policy, and not a rule, pre-publication in the Federal Register was not necessary.","FAA cites safety concerns, says policy applies to pilots with mild to moderate depression .

"(CNN) -- The average temperature in Bloomington, Minnesota, in January was 6.4 degrees Fahrenheit. But that didn't stop Adam Frey from grilling outdoors and burning through 80 pounds of charcoal during the month. Leroy and Judy McMillin of Spring, Texas, own three Big Green Eggs and built an outdoor kitchen to house them. Frey received a Big Green Egg -- a ceramic cooker that serves as a smoker, grill and oven -- for Christmas last year. Since then, he has devotedly grilled six or seven days a week. ""Extreme cold isn't an issue as long as you dress warm,"" Frey said. ""I have and will continue to cook out every day if possible."" The oval-shaped grill has amassed a cult-like following since it was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1974. Fans of the grill call themselves Eggheads. Tell us about your grill of choice . Frey began grilling more than 20 years ago but got his first Egg in 2008. ""It changed everything,"" he said. He now owns two Eggs and calls himself a ""grill junkie."" ""When you find yourself waking up, thinking about what you're going to grill that night, you're pretty addicted,"" Frey said. iReport.com: See photos of Frey's grilled meals . With a hefty price tag and weight -- some Eggs cost up to $900 and weigh more than 200 pounds -- the uninitiated may question whether the cookers are worth it. Eggheads, though, are quick to spread the gospel. Frey, who shared his story on iReport.com as part of CNN's ""grill masters"" assignment, wasn't the only one to express devotion to the ceramic cooker. Other iReporters shared photos, videos and stories about their egg-centricity. ""I am an Egghead. They should pay me, because I constantly encourage people to buy one,"" joked Brad Cates. Cates, an insurance and financial consultant in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, raves about the ease of heat control and versatility of his Egg. Fueled by charcoal, the Big Green Egg can reach up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit to sear a steak within minutes or cook a slow and low brisket for hours. ""It is better than any other grill or smoker I've had,"" Cates said. ""I've had numerous gas grills, and there is absolutely no comparison there."" Cates tends to ""cook in spurts,"" firing up the grill for two or three days some weeks. Ribs, covered in his secret homemade rub, are his specialty. ""I try to do at least three racks at a time, and they are gone within minutes,"" he said. Thanks to Cates' enthusiasm, co-worker John Lindsey decided to purchase a Big Green Egg. Now he, too, raves about it. ""The grill is like no other,"" Lindsey boasted. ""I have owned all types of grills, from the tiny charcoal grill to the giant stainless steel gas grills. But the BGE is by far my favorite."" Lindsey, 34, grills three or four times a week. His specialty is ""pork in general""; baby back ribs, pork tenderloin and pulled pork are some of his favorite dishes. He owns an XL Egg, which, according to the manufacturer, can cook 24 burgers, 12 steaks or 11 whole chickens at a time. iReport.com: See some XL Egg creations . More than a million Eggs have been sold since the company began, spokeswoman Donna Myers said. ""Word of mouth literally made the Egg what it is today,"" Myers said. She noted that BGE founder Ed Fisher began the company with little advertising revenue. ""For many years, these devoted Eggheads became the company's primary sales force,"" Myers said. Perhaps the biggest Eggheads in the iReport community are Leroy and Judy McMillin of Spring, Texas. The couple owns three Eggs and built an outdoor kitchen to house them. ""I think it's easy to see that we love our Eggs,"" Leroy McMillin said. McMillin bought his first Egg, which he calls Lily, in 1999. He has two smaller versions -- named Shirley and Maggie -- that he purchased in 2006 and 2007, respectively. His three ovoid ""girls"" are housed in their own hand-built outdoor kitchen called ""The Coop,"" complete with a sink, mini refrigerator, countless chicken decorations and a red light to indicate when the grills are in use. McMillin and his wife keep the chicken/egg theme going by referring to themselves as ""Spring Chicken"" and ""Spring Hen."" iReport.com: Take a video tour of ""The Coop"" McMillin, 68, is retired and considers himself one of the elder Egg enthusiasts. ""There are a few Eggheads older than me and a whole bunch younger than me,"" he said. ""I envy their enthusiasm and creativity. They seem to want to take 'Egg'n' to the next level."" The McMillins recently attended a nearby Big Green Egg demonstration and cookout. Leroy, wearing his ""I'm an Egghead"" shirt, proselytized to potential buyers. ""We just wanted to pass on to any prospective Eggheads how enjoyable cooking on the Egg can be,"" McMillin explained. In fact, he says, many friends have purchased their own green grill, thanks to his encouragement. The couple is headed to Atlanta in October for the annual EGGtoberfest, an annual event where more than 1,000 Eggheads converge to share recipes, meet fellow fanatics and purchase additional Eggs. McMillin says he enjoys both barbecuing and grilling and uses his Eggs, on average, six times a week. His wife, Judy, joins in the action, too.

"London, England (CNN) -- UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described himself as a ""penitent sinner"" on Wednesday after personally apologizing to a voter he described as a ""bigoted woman."" Brown visited the home of Gillian Duffy in Rochdale, northwestern England, after he was caught on microphone describing in blunt terms his encounter with the 65-year-old widow whom he met on the election campaign trail. The Labour party leader had had a discussion with Duffy about the size of Britain's national debt, tax and immigration. Brown then got into his car and was driven away but he was still wearing a radio microphone, allowing broadcasters to pick up his conversation with an aide. ""That was a disaster,"" Brown said about the encounter seconds earlier. ""Should never have put me with that woman -- whose idea was that?"" He added: ""She was just a sort of bigoted woman."" Why Brown's gaffe could get worse . The woman, Gillian Duffy, told reporters she wanted an apology from Brown over his ""very upsetting"" comments. Brown later visited Duffy at her home, emerging to tell reporters: ""I am mortified by what has happened. I have given her my sincere apologies. I misunderstood what she said. She has accepted that there was a misunderstanding and she has accepted my apology. ""If you like, I am a penitent sinner."" The encounter was immediately seized on by users of social networking sites, with opinions polarized between those who said it would damage Labour in the May 6 general election and those who believed it could help the party, currently trailing the opposition Conservatives in opinion polls. One Twitter user, Thermalsocks, said: ""Gordon Brown has created a total survailance society. Glad to see he got caught out, now he knows how we all feel."" Another user, urbantaoist85, said: ""Anyone else up for making all politicians wear a microphone at all times?"" Ririnyan added: ""I wonder if that was the final nail in the coffin for Labour this time."" Andy_Francis said: ""I think GB has just kissed goodbye to any chances Labour had left."" However CupCate wrote: ""I'd be more concerned if Brown had said, ""What that brilliant woman said about all those damn immigrants, too right!"" After his public apology, Brown telephoned Duffy to apologize personally. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""Gordon has apologized to Mrs. Duffy personally by phone. He does not think that she is bigoted. ""He was letting off steam in the car after a difficult conversation. But this is exactly the sort of conversation that is important in an election campaign and which he will continue to have with voters."" Asked about Brown's comments, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who has surged in the opinion polls following his appearance in the televised election debates with the other two leaders, told the Press Association: ""You should always try to answer the questions as best you can."" He added: ""He has been recorded saying what he has said and will have to answer for that."" But one Twitter user, SusanCalman, spoke for many when she said: ""I feel sorry for Gordon Brown. If people I've met knew half the things I'd said about them when I left I would be stabbed and left for dead.""","UK PM Gordon Brown describes woman who spoke to him as ""bigoted""

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- At a vigil protesting the passage of Arizona's tough new illegal immigration law, a young man in Army fatigues and a beret lit a candle at a makeshift shrine. Pfc. Jose Medina, an Army medic, came to the Arizona capitol while on leave, to express his sadness over the law, signed by Arizona's governor on Friday. ""I'm here because this is something that's close to my heart,"" said Medina. ""I went off to protect this country, to protect my family. That's what hurts."" The new law requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect that they're in the country illegally. Critics fear the law will result in racial profiling. The bill ""strengthens the laws of our state. It protects all of us, every Arizona citizen, and everyone here in our state lawfully. And it does so while ensuring that the constitutional rights of all in Arizona remain solid, stable and steadfast,"" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said. Medina, 20, is from El Mirage, a working class Latino community northwest of Phoenix. ""When I first joined the military, they would ask us where you from, and I would say 'I'm from the great state of Arizona,' "" Medina reflected. ""I was raised here, I grew up here. Now I don't know if I can say that so proudly. I don't know if I want to live here anymore."" Medina says he came to the United States from Mexico illegally when he was 2 years old. When he was 11 years old he became a legal resident of the United States and now has a green card. ""I felt I had a huge debt to this country that's given me so much,"" Medina said. ""When I heard the law that passed, I couldn't believe it. Because the America I know, freedom, liberties we enjoy, are for everyone and then this law passes and I'm like 'wow.' It's a shame; it's a state that doesn't even want you here? If I take this uniform off I'm just another person who came here illegally."" Just six hours before shipping off, Medina's family and friends gathered for a farewell feast. The Mexican barbecue could be smelled a block away. Impassioned conversation about the controversial law could be heard over the scratching of forks and knives on plates of tangy barbecue. ""You may go to Afghanistan, you may go to Iraq,"" said Medina's close family friend Victor, who did not want his full name used. ""After this night man, we may not see you again. You can give your life for this country. But your mom may be stopped by Joe Arpaio (the Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff known for aggressive policing.) ""That's true,"" Medina answered. ""But it's my duty to go."" ""You're Mexican,"" Victor said. ""I am of Mexican descent,"" said Medina. ""But I have grown to be an American."" Ricky, 22, a friend who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, is white and stops eating. ""We are all brothers over there,"" said Ricky, who did not want his full name used. Before the sun rose over Arizona on Sunday morning, Medina left El Mirage for deployment to Germany. Jose Medina wondered if some of his family members or friends, some of whom are undocumented, would still be in El Mirage when he returned. ""I worry will my family live in peace,"" he said. ""What good is keeping us safe here ... if we lose a part of what makes America so great? If we drive fear into our own peoples' hearts?""","Pfc.

"(CNN) -- Hungary awoke Monday to a new political landscape after the center-right opposition Fidesz party took decisive election victory, ending eight years of Socialist rule. Fidesz won two-thirds of the votes in Sunday's second round of parliamentary elections, gaining 263 of the 386 seats -- enough to allow it to govern without forming alliances. Fidesz leader Viktor Orban characterized the vote -- which also saw gains by the far-right -- as a ""revolution"" in the Eastern European country that was under Soviet control from 1945 to 1991. ""Today there was revolution in the polling booths,"" Fidesz leader Viktor Orban told a crowd of supporters, according to Hungary's MTI news agency. ""Hungarians have overthrown the system and created a new one. The old system of leaders misusing their power was replaced by one of national unity."" While the Socialist party took second place with 59 seats, it was closely followed by the far-right Jobbik party, making its parliamentary debut. Jobbik has come under international criticism for what many perceive as anti-Semitic statements and for its verbal attacks on the country's gypsy, or Roma, minority. Ahead of the vote, the Socialists has seen their support dwindle as they struggled to push through a broad reform program, tackling the country's education and health care systems. Their problems were compounded when the global recession hit Hungary hard. In late 2008, it had to borrow $27 billion from the International Monetary Fund as unemployment climbed into the double digits and the economy shrunk. The party was also derailed by scandals and accusations of corruption. In 2006, Hungarian radio played a leaked tape where former Prime Minister and Socialist Party member Ferenc Gyurcsany admitted that his party lied to the public to win that year's general election. Journalist Fanny Facsar contributed to this report.","Fidesz won 263 of the 386 seats in parliament. The Socialists won 59 .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney insists he will be fit to lead England's charge for the World Cup after injury curtailed the Manchester United striker's English Premier League season. The 24-year-old is currently sidelined with a groin injury but after picking up the Premier League's player of the year award -- voted for by his fellow professionals -- he said there is no way he will miss out on the tournament in South Africa. Rooney has been in lethal goalscoring form this season, netting 40 goals for club and country, and has been pinpointed as the key player in England's bid to lift the World Cup for only the second time in their history. ""The groin will be fine for the World Cup, there are no worries about that,"" he told the Professional Footballers' Association awards in London. ""I'm hoping to play for United in the last game of the season."" It is the first time Rooney has won the PFA award, though he has twice scooped the young player of the year award. He said: ""I remember coming here in 2005 and 2006 to win the young player of the year award. I saw the players winning the main one and it's something I've aimed for since."" Rooney paid tribute to his club manager, Alex Ferguson, who insists he has no plans to retire from the game, at 68. ""Sir Alex is a great manager who has really brought me on as a player since I joined United, Rooney said. ""His hunger passes through to the players. ""It's great to see that he's pushing 70 and he hasn't changed a bit. I'm sure he'll be at United a long time yet."" Rooney is hoping Manchester United can secure a fourth straight Premier League crown, but they remain one point behind Chelsea after Carlo Ancelotti's side thrashed Stoke 7-0 on Sunday. Chelsea travel to Liverpool next weekend in a game that could have a huge bearing on the destination of the title and Rooney is confident the Reds can do his side a favor. ""I'm sure Liverpool will want to beat Chelsea,"" said Rooney. ""The pride they've got and the history they've got, I'm sure they'll want to win that game. They are fighting to get into the Europa League.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court has certified the largest class-action employment lawsuit in U.S. history, in a long-standing dispute against retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. over alleged gender bias in pay and promotions. The divided 6-5 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday allows the combined multiparty litigation to move ahead to trial, where a decision against the company could result in billions in damages. The Arkansas-based chain of stores has the option of appealing Monday's ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court for review. At issue is whether more than a million current and former Wal-Mart employees can band together in their claims of discrimination, which they say has occurred over the past decade, at least. The plaintiffs allege that women were paid less than, and were given fewer opportunities for promotion than, their male counterparts. They seek back pay and punitive damages against the world's largest retailer. The lawsuit alleges that the company's ""strong, centralized structure fosters or facilitates gender stereotyping and discrimination."" The workers bringing suit also say women make up more than 70 percent of Wal-Mart's hourly work force but in the past decade made up less than one-third of its store management. The suit was first filed by Betty Dukes, a store greeter in Pittsburg, California, along with five of her co-workers in 2001. ""It has taken a very long time, and a tremendous amount of work, but it looks like we're finally going to get our day in court,"" Dukes said after the ruling was announced. ""That's all we've ever asked for."" ""We disagree with the decision of the sharply divided 6-5 court to uphold portions of the certification order, and are considering our options, including seeking review from the Supreme Court,"" Wal-Mart said in a statement. ""We do not believe the claims alleged by the six individuals who brought this suit are representative of the experiences of our female associates. Walmart is an excellent place for women to work and fosters female leadership among our associates and in the larger business world."" The federal appeals court concluded that there was enough merit in the claims to proceed to trial on a class-action track. Since the lawsuit was filed, both sides of the dispute have held so-called discovery hearings, in which preliminary testimony was taken to establish facts. Judge Susan Graber of the appeals court said that although ""the size of this class action is large, mere size does not render a case unmanageable."" The company has protested the size of the class action, which it called ""historic"" in scope, saying it would be too onerous to litigate. The company has more than 3,400 stores in 41 regions. Declaring class-action status for the lawsuit raises the financial and judicial stakes considerably, since more individual plaintiffs can now join, and creates greater potential liability for the company being sued. In federal courts, such certification must generally follow well-established principles to ensure that it does not become so large as to be impracticable and allows the parties to fairly represent the common interests of the larger class of plaintiffs. ""Wal-Mart tries to project an improved image as a good corporate citizen,"" said Brad Seligman, a Berkeley, California, lawyer representing the female workers. ""But no amount of [public relations] is going to work until it addresses the claims of its female employees."" Wal-Mart has been accused in separate lawsuits of discrimination against African-American truck drivers and workers with disabilities. In 2001, the company settled 13 lawsuits by paying out $6 million. Beyond this particular suit, most workplace discrimination lawsuits fail to reach a court for resolution, according to data compiled by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In 2003, when the Wal-Mart litigation was in its preliminary court stages, about 27,000 sex discrimination claims nationwide were resolved administratively by the EEOC, little changed from the prior decade. More than 57 percent -- 15,000 claims -- were ruled administratively to have ""no reasonable cause,"" and those usually were dismissed. Just over 10 percent were judged to have merit, resulting in a total of $94.2 million in settlements, or $34,200 on average per case, according to the data, which include all such claims, not just those involving Wal-Mart. The current case is Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (04-16688)","NEW: ""Walmart is an excellent place for women to work,"" company says .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Less than a day after Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency and scolded the country's media for being too ""negative,"" police stormed the offices of a television station early Sunday, AAJ-TV's director of news and current affairs said. Pakistani policemen patrol the streets of Islamabad, Pakistan, Saturday. Armed with guns, the two dozen police said they had orders to take the station's equipment, including a van that the station uses to broadcast live coverage, Talat Hussain said. ""We resisted,"" Hussain said. ""We said show us the papers."" The police didn't have proof their demands were legitimate, he said, adding the officers said only that they had orders ""from the highest authority."" ""They said, 'We'll do it the nice way or the other way,' "" Hussain said. A brief scuffle between the policemen and about 40 journalists in the station followed, but no one was hurt, he said. During the confrontation, two AAJ journalists were able to drive the news van away from the station, Hussain said. Police later left the building, but remained outside, Hussain said. The raid followed a government directive to the media, warning journalists that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000, Hussain said. Earlier, in a Saturday night televised address to the Pakistani public aimed at explaining why he had declared a countrywide state of emergency and suspended the constitution, Musharraf was critical of the country's media, saying they had ""added insult to injury."" ""The media could not lend a helping hand to improve the situation,"" Musharraf said, describing ""the situation"" in Pakistan as fraught with tension and constrained by the spread of terrorism. ""I said frequently that the media should not be negative,"" Musharraf said. Shortly after private networks reported Saturday that Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency was imminent, most media channels went off the air in an apparent blackout, although some flickered off and on.

"Mount Everest, Nepal (CNN) -- Even from more than 21,000 feet up the world's tallest mountain, 13-year-old Jordan Romero couldn't resist the opportunity to greet his mother in a live television broadcast Monday. ""Hi, Mom,"" Romero said with a wave of his hand during the interview broadcast on CNN from the advance base camp on Mount Everest in Nepal. The interview followed the first day of real climbing in Romero's attempt to become the youngest person ever to reach the summit of Everest, 29,028 feet (8,847 meters) above sea level. Accompanied by his father and his father's girlfriend, and backed by a team of sherpas and yaks that helped transport their 2,000 kilograms (4,400 pounds) of gear, Romero needed 13 days just to reach the point where real climbing began. Paul Romero, Jordan's father, said the first day of the actual ascent Monday required technical climbing in tough weather conditions, including ice and snow. For Jordan, it's all part of the journey. ""It could take ... a couple of weeks or a couple of years,"" he said, sitting in a tent wearing a parka and fluorescent yellow cap, and with a blue sleeping bag over his legs. ""This is the first of many attempts."" His initial impressions? The trip is both hard and great. ""It's Mount Everest. It's a tough mountain. The altitude is tough,"" Romero said. ""It's both physically and technically hard. There's a lot of new things."" At the same time, ""I've been able to see Mount Everest from wherever I go. I'm already happy with that."" In addition, Romero said, he was learning ""a lot about culture, politics, religion, people, everything about Nepal and China."" ""So it's been such a great trip, and I've learned so much from it,"" he said. Paul Romero praised his son's climbing Monday, noting that they spent 10 hours on ice and snow. ""Knock on wood, everybody's healthy,"" the elder Romero said, adding: ""Jordan today had a stellar day."" Before they started, Jordan said he wanted to climb Everest for himself and to inspire more young people to get outdoors. ""Obese children are the future of America, the way things are going,"" he said on April 9 in Kathmandu. ""I am hoping to change that by doing what I do: climbing and motivational speaking. I want to motivate children and inspire them to get outdoors."" With a smile, he added: ""I am doing this a little for myself, too, to do something big."" Romero has climbed five of the seven highest peaks on seven continents, known as the Seven Summits. Having a very encouraging father and his girlfriend, who have gone around the world participating in climbing expeditions and competing in endurance racing competitions, certainly helps. ""This is not an isolated vacation,"" Paul Romero said before the climbing began. ""This is a lifestyle. We travel everywhere and climb together."" The family started tackling the Seven Summits in summer 2005. Jordan was just 9 when they climbed the 19,341 feet to the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Since there is a debate about whether the tallest mountain in Oceania is Kosciuszko in mainland Australia or Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, Jordan and his family climbed both. The only peak left for the adventurers to climb after Everest is the Vinson Massif in Antarctica; a trip is planned for December. The idea to climb the Seven Summits came to Jordan when he saw a mural of the mountains in the hallway of his school when he was 9. Before sharing his dream with his father, he did all the necessary research and only two weeks later told him of his ambition. ""I was very shocked he even knew what the Seven Summits were,"" Paul Romero recalled. ""But then, he is a complete nature fanatic."" Jordan's father and his girlfriend, Karen Lundgren, went to Kathmandu for the first time last year to see whether Jordan could make the Everest summit from the south face in Nepal. They decided instead to start their climb in the north, in China. ""The mountaineering world and Jordan may have their concerns about Jordan's age, but the boy is as strong and skilled a mountaineer as many of the people climbing,"" Paul Romero said. ""There is a proficient support and safety system about him."" The highest peak Jordan has climbed is Aconcagua in Argentina, which stands at 22,841 feet. He spent weeks preparing for the ascent of Everest. ""I have been exercising hard, concentrating on cardio training and endurance training,"" Jordan said before the trip. ""I have been sleeping in an altitude simulator tent for the past month to get my lungs ready."" Jordan has been an outdoor person all his life and takes kids to climb mountains in the Big Bear region of California, where he lives. Despite his achievements, Jordan wants to be seen as a regular kid. ""I try to seem like an average kid who happens to be climbing,"" he said this month. ""But I'm not really fitting in.""","13-year-old Californian aims to become youngest to climb world's highest mountain .

"(CNN) -- Sweden's parliament on Wednesday approved same-sex marriage legislation, according to the parliament's Web site. Previously, two people of the same sex could register their partnership, but with this vote, sex will no longer matter when two people want to get married. The new ""sex-neutral"" law will take effect on May 1. Couples who already had a registered partnership can now either stay in that union or transform it into a marriage if they wish, the Web site said. The ""yes"" votes numbered 261, while 22 members of parliament voted ""no"" and 16 chose not to vote. The Christian Democrats was the only party opposed to the new law. ""Unfortunately this is not an April Fool's Day joke, this is reality,"" Yvonne Andersson, member of the Swedish parliament for the Christian Democrats, wrote on the party's Web site following the vote. The party had instead proposed a law that would remove the word ""marriage"" from Swedish law and replace it with a legally binding union between two persons, thus separating it from the Christian ceremony that the church conducts. Asa Regner, secretary general of the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education, told CNN that Wednesday's vote meant a very important change in Swedish law. ""This was the last area where same sex couples were treated differently,"" she said.","Sweden's parliament approves legislation allowing same-sex marriage .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court on Monday affirmed the conviction and life sentence for convicted terrorist and 9/11 co-conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. Moussaoui had agreed to plead guilty in 2005 to six criminal conspiracy charges arising from the al Qaeda terror plot to use commercial aircraft to strike key U.S. targets on September 11, 2001, in the worst domestic terror attack in American history. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit concluded Moussaoui's trial was fair, despite the defendant representing himself against the advice of the trial judge and his own lawyers. The judges said a life sentence imposed by the jury was appropriate. ""Moussaoui, having pled guilty, has waived all nonjurisdictional errors leading up to his conviction except those affecting the adequacy of his pleas,"" the panel said. Moussaoui has been held by the government since August 2001, and was the first person charged in the United States in connection with the 9/11 attacks. He was indicted in December 2001, accused of being part of a broader terror conspiracy in the months leading up to 9/11. Several other accused top al Qaeda officials -- including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- are awaiting transfer into federal custody and future prosecution in civilian courts, the same as Moussaoui. Government sources have told CNN that three top al Qaeda detainees have told their interrogators that Moussaoui was not meant for the 9/11 plot, but for a future terror operation. Moussaoui had said as much in open court, admitting allegiance to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, but denying he was to have been part of the 9/11 hijacking of planes. Prosecutors had questioned the validity of some of his claims. The 41-year-old faced the death penalty, but was instead given life in prison, and serves his sentence at the so-called ""Supermax"" correctional facility in Colorado. His trial was delayed for many months over whether the French citizen of Moroccan descent had the right to introduce testimony from the three top al Qaeda leaders who he said may have evidence that could clear him. The court agreed but said no direct access was allowed, only written summaries of the interrogations. That evidence was the key basis of Moussaoui's current appeal. ""We find it significant that Moussaoui never sought to rescind the admissions he had just made"" at his March 2005 guilty plea, wrote the judges, ""nor to withdraw his guilty plea during the nearly three-year long period that elapsed between his [initial] appeal and the conclusion of the sentencing proceeding."" Moussaoui tried to use bin Laden's own words to help his case. The Saudi leader -- reportedly in hiding in Pakistan or Afghanistan -- said in an audio message, ""I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers -- Allah have mercy upon them --- with those raids ... and I did not assign brother Zacarias to be with them on that mission."" Those 19 Muslim men were the al-Qaeda members aboard the planes that crashed one 9/11. At the same time, the defendant also claimed he was supposed to fly a fifth plane into the White House, and that Richard Reid, the so-called ""shoe bomber"" was supposed to be on his hijacking team. Only four planes were involved in the 9/11 attacks. But after his May 2006 sentencing, Moussaoui claimed he lied on the stand. His erratic behavior at trial, including his frequent outbursts and threats and his insistence of representing himself for a time, led to calls for a mistrial by his legal team. In his last public appearance at his sentencing, Moussaoui waved the ""V"" victory sign, and attacked the United States. ""We will come back another day,"" Moussaoui told the court. ""As long as you don't hear, America, you will feel. ... God curse America. God bless Osama bin Laden. You will never get him."" Moussaoui now has the option of asking the full appeals court to hear his case or of going directly to the Supreme Court. The justices had earlier refused to stop his trial from going ahead. The case is Moussaoui v. U.S. (06-4494)..","Convicted terrorist and 9/11 co-conspirator remains in maximum security prison .

"(CNN) -- Thailand and Cambodia have called for dialogue as tensions continued to escalate over an ancient border temple on disputed land. Cambodian soldiers stand guard near Preah Vihear temple, close to the Thai border. The countries agreed to meet Monday even as each side deployed more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple, the national Thai News Agency reported Thursday. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962, but the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Last week, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing.  Watch Thai villagers block anti-government demonstrators » . A Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama. He had endorsed the application. Cambodia, meanwhile, is preparing for general elections on July 27. And Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph. The current flare-up began Tuesday, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the trio refused to leave the territory, the Thai News Agency said. The Cambodian state-run news agency, AKP, said that Thailand sent troops to retrieve the men and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies the charge, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory. The standoff continued Thursday, with each side asking troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon, the news agencies said. Thailand has put its Air Force on standby to evacuate its nationals from Cambodia if tensions worsen, TNA said. So far, the only casualty has been a Thai soldier who was injured Tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the Khmer Rouge occupied the area. The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, won power through a guerrilla war. It is remembered for the deaths of as many as 1.5 million Cambodians.","Both agreed to meet as each side deployed more troops to Preah Vihear temple .

"(Mental Floss) -- Having a disease named after you is a decidedly mixed bag. On the one hand, your scientific developments are forever commemorated. On the other hand, though, you're stuck with the knowledge that no patient will ever be happy upon hearing your name. Who are the scientists and doctors behind some of our most famous diseases and conditions, though? Here are a few of the physicians and their eponymous ailments: . 1. Crohn's disease . The inflammatory digestive disease could just have easily ended up with the name Ginzburg's disease or Oppenheimer's disease. In 1932, three New York physicians named Burrill Bernard Crohn, Leon Ginzburg, and Gordon Oppenheimer published a paper describing a new sort of intestinal inflammation. Since Crohn's name was listed first alphabetically, the condition ended up bearing his name. 2. Salmonellosis . Yes, the salmonella menace that haunts undercooked chicken is named after a person. Daniel Elmer Salmon was a veterinary pathologist who ran a USDA microorganism research program during the late 19th century. Although Salmon didn't actually discover the type of bacterium that now bears his name -- famed epidemiologist Theobald Smith isolated the bacteria in 1885 -- he ran the research program in which the discovery occurred. Smith and his colleagues named the bacteria salmonella in honor of their boss. Mental Floss: Margherita pizza, other foods named after people . 3. Parkinson's disease . James Parkinson was a busy fellow. While the English apothecary had a booming medical business, he also dabbled in geology, paleontology, and politics; Parkinson even published a three-volume scientific study of fossils. Following a late-18th-century foray into British politics where he advocated a number of social causes and found himself briefly ensnared in an alleged plot to assassinate King George III, Parkinson turned his attention to medicine. Parkinson did some research on gout and peritonitis, but it was his landmark 1817 study ""An Essay on the Shaking Palsy"" that affixed his name to Parkinson's disease. 4. Huntington's disease . George Huntington wasn't the most prolific researcher, but he made his papers count. In 1872, a fresh-out-of-med-school Huntington published one of two research papers he would write in his life. In the paper, Huntington described the effects of the neurodegenerative disorder that now bears his name after examining several generations of family that all suffered from the genetic condition. 5. Alzheimer's disease . In 1901, German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer began observing an odd patient at a Frankfurt asylum. The 51-year-old woman, Mrs. Auguste Deter, had no short-term memory and behaved strangely. When Mrs. Deter died in 1906, Alzheimer began to dissect the patient's brain, and he presented his findings that November in what was the first formal description of presenile dementia. Mental Floss: 4 people with super memory . 6. Tourette syndrome . Credit George Gilles de la Tourette for his modesty. When the French neurologist first described the illness that now bears his name in 1884, he didn't name it after himself. Instead, he referred to the condition as ""maladie des tics."" Tourette's mentor and contemporary Jean-Martin Charcot renamed the illness after Tourette. Tourette didn't have such great luck with patients, though. In 1893, a deluded former patient shot the doctor in the head. The woman claimed that she lost her sanity after Tourette hypnotized her. Tourette survived the attack. 7. Hodgkin's lymphoma . British pathologist Thomas Hodgkin first described the cancer that now bears his name while working at Guy's Hospital in London in 1832. Hodgkin published the study ""On Some Morbid Appearances of the Absorbent Glands and Spleen"" that year, but the condition didn't bear his name until a fellow physician, Samuel Wilks, rediscovered Hodgkin's work. 8. Bright's disease . The kidney disease bears the name of Richard Bright, an English physician and colleague of Hodgkin's at Guy's Hospital. Bright began looking into the causes of kidney trouble during the 1920s, and in 1927 he described an array of kidney ailments that eventually became known as Bright's disease. Today, doctors understand many of the symptoms historically clumped together as Bright's disease are in fact different maladies, so the term is rarely used. 9. Addison's disease . Guy's Hospital was apparently the place to work in the 19th century if you wanted to have a disease named after you. Thomas Addison, a colleague of Bright and Hodgkin at Guy's Hospital, first described the adrenal disorder we call Addison's disease in 1855. On top of this discovery, Addison also published an early study of appendicitis. Mental Floss: 11 celebrities who overcame dyslexia . 10. Tay-Sachs disease . Although both of their names are attached to this genetic disorder, Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs didn't work together. In fact, they didn't even work in the same country. Tay, a British opthalmologist, first described the disease's characteristic red spot on the retina in 1881. In 1887 Bernard Sachs, a colleague of Burrill Crohn at Mount Sinai Hospital, described the cellular effects of the disease and its prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews. 11. Turner syndrome . The chromosomal disorder got its name from Oklahoma doctor Henry Turner, who first described the condition in 1938. 12. Klinefelter's syndrome . The genetic condition in which males have an extra X chromosome bears the name of Harry Klinefelter, a young Boston endocrinologist who published a landmark study while working under the tutelage of endocrinology star Dr. Fuller Albright in 1942. Albright pushed his young protégé to be the lead author of the paper that described the condition, so the young Klinefelter's name is forever associated with the syndrome. 13. Asperger's syndrome . Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger first described the syndrome that now bears his name in 1944 after observing a group of over 400 children who suffered from what Asperger described as ""autistic psychopathy."" Interestingly, since Asperger's research was all written in German, his contributions to the literature went unrecognized until much later. The term ""Asperger's syndrome"" didn't come into widespread usage until 1981. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com . Entire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday approved the extradition of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to France, where he faces a 10-year sentence on a conviction in absentia on money-laundering charges. Manuel Noriega, in a 1989 file photo, leaves his headquarters in Panama City, Panama. Magistrate William Turnoff agreed with the government's case for extraditing Noriega to France and issued a ""certificate of extradability."" Noriega's lawyer, Frank Rubino, said he would continue to fight the extradition. He had said Noriega hoped to return to Panama to be closer to his family. The issue has emerged because Noriega is scheduled to complete his Florida prison term on September 9. The former Panamanian strongman was captured in the 1989 U.S. military invasion of Panama and was convicted in 1992 of racketeering for accepting bribes to allow drugs to be shipped through Panama destined for the United States. His attorneys had argued that his status as a prisoner of war meant he should be returned to Panama, but a separate court ruling last Friday rejected that argument. ""This court never intended for the proclamation of defendant as a POW to shield him from all future prosecutions for serious crimes he is alleged to have committed,"" Senior U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler wrote in Friday's 12-page opinion. ""It appears that the extradition proceedings should proceed uninterrupted."" Hoeveler noted that Noriega ""has not always sought repatriation,"" and had, at one time, asked to be allowed to go to a third country. Noriega also faces possible prison time in Panama, where he is accused of kidnapping, extortion and the murder of political opponents. Though the charges are more serious, if the 69-year-old Noriega is convicted of murder, he would likely serve much of his sentence under home detention in Panama. Panamanian law provides home detention for anyone 74 years old or older. The Panamanian constitution would also forbid his extradition to France. Next month, Noriega will have served nearly 17½ years of an original 40-year sentence in the United States. The sentence was later reduced to 30 years, and further shortened for good behavior.

"(CNN) -- Authorities believe that a registered sex offender who this month admitted killing two California teenagers attempted to follow an 11-year-old girl walking home from school the day before one of the teens disappeared, according to documents filed in the case. John Albert Gardner, 31, pleaded guilty April 16 to killing Chelsea King, 17, and Amber Dubois, 14. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of assault with intent to commit rape in a December incident involving a third woman. King was last seen leaving Poway High School in suburban San Diego, California, on February 25. Her car, with her cell phone inside, was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park. King was known to run on the park's trails. Her disappearance triggered a massive search that ended a few days later, when King's remains were found in the park. Dubois disappeared in February 2009 while walking to school in Escondido, California. She was considered a missing person for more than a year until her remains were found in March. Prosecutors said Gardner led police to Dubois' body after being assured that it would not be used against him in court. Gardner avoided the death penalty with his guilty plea but will be sentenced June 1 to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, under terms of the plea deal with prosecutors. On February 24, a day before King went missing, an 11-year-old girl reported that she was walking home from school when she heard a vehicle slowly approaching her from behind, according to an affidavit requesting a police search of Gardner's home, posted on the website of CNN affiliate KTLA-TV. The documents were unsealed Monday, KTLA reported. The girl told police the vehicle drove past her and then parked about 30 feet in front of her, the documents said. The driver stayed in the vehicle, the girl said, and did not attempt to speak to her. But a woman pulled up next to the girl and told her the person in the vehicle ""seemed very suspicious"" and offered to follow her home, according to the affidavit. The man, who was in a black car, then made a U-turn and left, and the woman followed the girl the remaining two blocks to her house, the documents said. The girl's mother called police after her daughter told her what happened. The girl's mother told authorities that after seeing a photo of Gardner following his arrest in the King case, her daughter said Gardner was ""the guy in the car,"" the affidavit said. Gardner's girlfriend drives a black 2002 Nissan Sentra, according to the documents. The documents also detail the December assault on the third woman near where King's car was found at the park. She told authorities she was on a hiking trail and a man walked past her, the affidavit said. She told him, ""Good morning,"" and he returned the greeting, but then tackled her from the side as he passed her, knocking her to the ground on her back. The man pinned her to the ground, and she screamed while struggling with him, the affidavit said. He told her to ""shut up,"" and she said, ""You're going to have to kill me."" ""That can be arranged,"" he responded. The man then demanded money from her, the affidavit said. She was able to sit up and used her elbow to strike him in the nose, telling police she felt ""the crunch of cartilage."" The man let go of her and grabbed his nose, she said, and she ran. A woman also told police that she saw Gardner on the jogging trails near the park on the day King disappeared, the affidavit said. She said he was sitting and drinking a beer and had several empty beer cans around him. He warned her about a rattlesnake that was nearby, and they spoke briefly. The woman said she ran past the man and then talked to him some more on her return trip. The man was wearing blue jeans and a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt, she said, according to the affidavit. A second woman also recalled seeing a man in the Hard Rock Cafe shirt on a trail that day about 3 p.m., about an hour and a half after the first woman said she saw him, the affidavit said. The same woman believes she saw King on the trail as well. Both women told police they were 100 percent sure the man they saw was Gardner, the affidavit said. The area where the second woman recalled seeing Gardner was ""300 yards from where the panties of Chelsea King were found and about a mile from where the body of Chelsea King was found,"" the affidavit said. At the time of his arrest, Gardner was a registered sex offender. In 2000 he was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 and a count of false imprisonment, according to a probation officer's report. The victim in that case was a 13-year-old girl, who was molested and beaten when she tried to resist, the report said. ""The defendant ... manifests marked predatory traits and is not seen as a suitable candidate for sex offender treatment insofar as he refuses to accept any responsibility for what he has done,"" according to the 2000 report. Gardner knew the girl and was a former neighbor of hers, the report said. ""The fact that he would try to force himself on her sexually is indefensible but then to beat her as he did out of frustration ... represents a qualitative leap to extremely serious criminal behavior."" The report recommended that Gardner be sentenced to six years in prison. KTLA reported that he served five years before being paroled.","Officials say John Albert Gardner III followed girl, 11, but was scared off .

"New York (CNN) -- Two men have been arrested in a bold and bizarre jewelry store robbery involving crooks who disguised themselves in Hasidic Jewish attire, complete with hats and false beards, police announced Tuesday. But all was not as it seemed, according to police. The heist was actually an elaborate inside job set up by the store's owners, who were $1 million in debt and six months behind on their rent, police said. The New York Police Department announced Tuesday that Atul Shah, 43, and Mahaveer Kankariya, 43, both of New Jersey, have been arrested on charges of grand larceny, insurance fraud and falsifying business records. The two men, co-owners of the Dialite Imports jewelry store in Manhattan's diamond district, are in custody, authorities said. The costumed robbers connected to the crime remain at large. According to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne, two armed men casually walked into the commercial office building where Dialite Imports was located on the afternoon of December 31, 2008. They were dressed in traditional looking Orthodox-style clothing and quickly gained access to the store's safe, spray-painting two security cameras in the process. The two thieves appeared to make off with about $4 million in diamonds and other jewels. Immediately after the robbery, Shah told the New York Post that his insurance company had instructed him to refrain from commenting about the heist. ""They told me I cannot say anything right now,"" he said at the time. But police said Tuesday that investigators became suspicious of the incident when it was discovered that Shah and Kankariya got a new insurance policy just before the apparent robbery. The owners of the jewelry company hired the two men ""to play the armed robbers and dressed them up as Hasidic Jews to avoid causing suspicion,"" Browne said. The robbery and security camera footage of the two supposed orthodox outlaws gained particular attention because of the similarities between the staged robbery and the 2000 movie ""Snatch,"" in which diamond thieves donned similar outfits for their burglary.","On New Year's Eve 2008, two people disguised as Hasidic Jews robbed jewelry store .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- During emergency drills at Deer Creek Middle School, teacher David Benke used to tell his students that if anything ever happened, he wanted to be able to ""do something about it."" When he saw a man shooting at students as they were leaving the Littleton, Colorado, school on Tuesday, ""What was going through my mind,"" Benke said, ""was that I promised."" Benke tackled the gunman, who had shot and wounded two students, and with the help of another teacher and some bus drivers, was able to hold him until police arrived. ""I noticed that he was working a bolt-action rifle,"" he said. ""I noticed that and realized that I had time to get him before he could chamber another round."" Still, Benke told reporters Wednesday, ""it bothers me that I was a little bit late. It bothers me that he got the second shot off"" and struck a second student. Authorities identified the suspect as Bruco Strongeagle Eastwood, 32. Eastwood, who police said had been a student at the school in the 1990s, was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder. He appeared in court via video link from jail Wednesday morning. CNN affiliate KUSA reported a judge ordered him held on $1 million bond. If he does post bond, the court ordered that he have no contact with anyone under 18 and said he must seek mental health treatment, KUSA reported. It also said that if he posts bond, he cannot possess alcohol, drugs or firearms and must be monitored by GPS. The affiliate said Eastwood's next court appearance is March 2. Authorities released no information about a motive in the shooting, saying the case was still under investigation. Deer Creek is two miles from Columbine High School, site of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, where 12 students and one teacher were killed in 1999. The two gunmen, both Columbine students, then turned their guns on themselves. The students wounded Tuesday, a boy and a girl, were taken to Littleton Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, a sheriff's office spokeswoman said. Principal Rob Hoover said one is doing well and the other was ""progressing well"" but was still hospitalized. Both students were eighth-graders, the school district said. KUSA reported one was Reagan Weber, who was treated and released from Littleton Adventist Hospital. The other, Matthew Thieu, was in serious condition at Children's Hospital. In a written statement, his mother expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support, but asked for privacy as she focuses on his recovery. She said her son was recovering from a fractured rib and a lung injury. Eastwood's father, War Eagle Eastwood, told KUSA that his son had struggled with mental illness, was behind on bills and couldn't hold a job because of his ""not really knowing what he's doing half the time."" His son, who heard voices, tried to seek help, he said, but had no money to pay for it. Bruco Eastwood had been cooperative with investigators, said Jefferson County sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley. Eastwood had been living with his father for about five years, and was unemployed other than working as ""kind of a ranch hand"" for his father, she said. He had been attending a community college attempting to get his GED. The rifle used belonged to Eastwood's father, she said. Authorities found additional rounds around the school property. School officials could not give many details to reporters Wednesday because of an ongoing police investigation, but Hoover said the suspect had come inside the school earlier and signed in. ""We know he did that much, but then we know he left, and that was all we knew at that point."" Assistant Principal Becky Brown told reporters she ran outside after hearing ""the pop"" and saw Benke tackle the suspect. ""When I saw Dr. Benke and the look on his face, I knew that we needed to help,"" she said. While Benke and the suspect struggled on the ground, she grabbed the gun ""and got it out of there,"" she said. Benke said the suspect threatened to sue him during the struggle, saying he was using excessive force. Asked why she ran toward gunshots when others might flee, Brown grew emotional as she said, ""Those kids are my kids, and it's important, and my teachers, we're like family."" ""You're just doing what you can do to try and protect your kids,"" Benke said. CNN's Andy Rose contributed to this report.","Teacher says he promised students he'd protect them if something happened .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain was touting U.S.-Canadian economic and energy ties in a visit north Friday, while Sen. Barack Obama hammered his GOP opponent for embracing offshore drilling and other energy policies. Sen. John McCain is in Canada on Friday, while Sen. Barack Obama talks to Democratic governors. Obama, speaking to Democratic governors in Chicago, Illinois, hit McCain hard for his support of the gas tax ""holiday"" as well as drilling off the U.S. coasts. Obama told the 16 governors attending an economic summit at the Chicago History Museum that McCain ""has essentially embraced"" President Bush's energy policy. ""When I hear McCain say that he is now in favor of the same oil drilling off the coast that he was opposed to just a week ago, what he doesn't tell you is that George Bush's own energy department has said that this would have no impact on consumers until 2030,"" he said, ""no appreciable impact for the next 22 years. Something they're not telling consumers.""  Watch more of Obama's speech » . At an afternoon news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, Obama continued to lash out at McCain's oil drilling policy. ""John McCain's proposal, George Bush's proposal to drill offshore here in Florida, and other places around the country, would not provide families with any relief, this year, next year, five years from now,"" he said. ""Believe me, if I thought there was any evidence at all that drilling could save people money who are struggling to fill up their gas tanks by this summer or the next few years, I would consider it, but it won't."" At the Chicago summit, several governors touched on the economic woes affecting their respective states. ""There is a deep recession, and frankly, I believe it's actually gathering momentum. I don't think we're halfway through this,"" New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine said. Ted Strickland, governor of the swing state of Ohio, pledged his support to Obama to ""make sure that you're the next president."" The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said, ""What you need, I believe, is a partner in Washington that understands your people, understands the hopes and dreams of the American people, and is not expected to solve every one of their problems but is willing to give them the tools they need to succeed and prosper and live out the American dream."" Also Friday, the Obama camp announced he would make a campaign appearance with Sen. Hillary Clinton on June 27. The campaigning will follow a Democratic fundraiser Thursday that will mark the first time the former rivals have appeared together publicly since the New York senator ended her presidential bid.  Watch more on next week's campaign event » . This week, Obama said, ""I have not had conversations with Sen. Clinton because she has been getting a well-deserved vacation. And we will be speaking, I think, in the next few days, certainly within the next week, and we'll be having an ongoing conversation."" The Obama campaign said details of the pair's itinerary would be released later. Meanwhile, the presumptive GOP nominee was in Canada on Friday, focusing on U.S. relations with its northern neighbor. At the Economic Club of Toronto in Ottawa, McCain said that although there ""aren't any electoral votes to be won up here in the middle of a presidential election ... there are many shared interests that require our attention today, and many Canadians here I am very proud to call friends."" ""And today, the strength of that partnership is more vital than ever. The economic community we have founded, together with our alliance and the values we hold in common, have served our people for decades and has served us well. It will fall to the next president to strengthen these ties still further, adding to the security and prosperity of all of North America.""  McCain said he will seek to expand trade and diplomatic ties if elected.  Watch more on McCain's speech in Canada » . David Axelrod, chief strategist for the Obama campaign, blasted McCain's policy speech in Canada. ""Sen. McCain is making his case in Canada. He ought to come and make it here in the United States and listen to what people around this country are saying,"" he said. McCain also talked about energy and environmental problems, including global warming. ""We must also work to ensure reliable energy supplies and increase sources of renewable energy. ... Canada is America's largest energy supplier. Not only does Canada have the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world, 60 percent of the energy produced in Canada is hydroelectric, clean energy. We stand much to gain by harmonizing our energy policies, just as we have gained by cooperating in trade through NAFTA."" While McCain supports the North American Free Trade Agreement, it has remained a hot-button issue for Democratic voters. Before the Ohio primary in March, the battle between Obama and Clinton morphed into a fierce debate over free trade, a clash that seemed to hinge on which candidate could appear more anti-NAFTA. But in a recent interview with Fortune magazine, Obama appears to be backing off his tough talk on trade. ""Sometimes during campaigns, the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified,"" he said. McCain insisted several times after his speech in Ottawa that the trip was not political, and he refused to answer any questions about Obama. Asked how the trip could be deemed nonpolitical when his campaign organized and executed it, McCain said the visit took place in the middle of campaigning and he didn't want taxpayers to pay for it. Meanwhile, a new CNN ""poll of polls"" released Friday evening shows Obama leading McCain by 6 percentage points, 46 percent to 40 percent. The national general election ""poll of polls"" consists of three surveys: Newsweek (June 18-19), Gallup tracking (June 16-19) and Fox News/Opinion Dynamics (June 17-18). The poll of polls does not have a sampling error.

"(CNN) -- Iran should release seven Baha'i prisoners accused of espionage because it does not have any evidence against them, their lawyer Shirin Ebadi told CNN on Saturday. Attorneys Abdolfattah Soltani, left, and Shirin Ebadi, shown in Tehran in 2004. ""In the files, in the case basically, there is nothing, no reason that basically convicts them,"" said Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The trial will begin Tuesday despite the fact that one of their lawyers is behind bars and Ebadi is outside the country. Other attorneys can be appointed, Hassan Haddad of the Prosecutor's Office in Tehran told the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. But the court must recognize the replacements, who are colleagues of Ebadi at her Tehran-based Defenders of Human Rights Center, not appoint other lawyers, Ebadi said. The imprisoned lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, is a well-known advocate with the human rights center. He was arrested in the aftermath of Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election and is being held at Evin prison, the same place where his clients are detained, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights. He is being held on charges of taking ""measures against national security,"" Ebadi said. ""Mr. Soltani is completely innocent."" Soltani had an opportunity to leave prison, but under conditions he chose not to accept, Ebadi said. Along with not giving any interviews after his release, Soltani would also have to end his work with the human rights center and no longer support Ebadi, she said. In another attack on the law firm, a lawyer was arrested after agents entered the center with guns, searched each room and then declared that they found opium on the premises, Ebadi said. That lawyer, whose family had been harassed by police, accused the agents of planting the opium, she said. Ebadi was on a speaking tour when Soltani was arrested and has not returned to Iran. The firm founded by Ebadi took up the case of the seven Baha'is last year. They are accused of spying for Israel, spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and committing religious offenses. The Baha'i International Community, which has a delegation to the United Nations, denies the allegations. The evidence against the defendants includes communication from Israel, but that is because the Baha'i World Center has its headquarters in Israel, said Kit Bigelow, director of external affairs at the American Baha'i Community. Prosecutors are calling that communication espionage, she said. Human rights groups have demanded the release of the prisoners and accused the government of targeting them because of their religious beliefs. The Baha'i faith originated in 19th-century Persia, and while modern-day Iran does not recognize it, the government denies any mistreatment of the members of the largest non-Muslim religious minority. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran has reported a rise in persecution of Baha'is in recent years, including cemetery desecration, arbitrary detention, home raids, property confiscation, work expulsion and denial of basic civil rights. The case of the seven Baha'is has drawn global attention. Roxana Saberi, the Iranian-American journalist freed from Evin prison earlier this year, spoke on their behalf, as have Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan federal commission. The defendants face the death penalty if convicted. Six of the defendants were arrested in May 2008 at their Tehran homes, and one was arrested in the eastern city of Mashad in March 2008, said Diane Ala'i, the Baha'i International Community's representative to the United Nations. The defendants were held under solitary confinement for the first five months of their incarceration, she said. The investigation into the charges against the prisoners concluded months ago and the trial was initially scheduled to start in July. Iran has continued to hold them in Evin prison without access to their lawyers and with minimal contact with their families, Ala'i said. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Seven Baha'i prisoners accused of espionage to go on trial Tuesday in Iran .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Police in Belgium arrested 14 Muslim extremists on Friday after uncovering a plot to free an al Qaeda suspect from prison using weapons and explosives. Nizar Trabelsi appeared before a correctional court in 2005 for assault and battery against a prison warden. Security across the small European state was stepped up in the wake of the alleged conspiracy, a spokeswoman for Belgium's federal prosecutors told a news conference. Lieve Pellens said the conspirators planned to liberate Nizar Trabelsi, a Tunisian terrorist suspect who has been in custody since his arrest two days after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001. Trabelsi, a former professional soccer player in Germany, was jailed for 10 years in 2003 for planning to blow up a NATO military base in Belgium that housed American soldiers. The 37-year-old admitted planning to drive a car bomb into the canteen at Kleine Brogel, an air base where about 100 American military personnel are stationed. Trabelsi, who testified to a Belgium court that he intended kill American soldiers, claimed to have met Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan after joining anal Qaeda  group. Pellens said most of the arrests were in the capital Brussels. In the wake of the arrests, she said extra police were being deployed on transport networks, at railway stations and airports and commercial centers to guard against a terrorist attack over the busy holiday period. ""Since it is not excluded that this group developed other projects and because the state of emergency in this period of the year is higher, the federal prosecutor and the examining magistrate decided to take no risks and intervene in the biggest possible way,"" Pellens told the news conference that was broadcast on Belgium television. On its Web site, the U.S. Embassy in Brussels issued an alert to American citizens in Belgium to maintain a high level of vigilance, especially in crowded public places. However, it said it had ""no information to indicate that U.S. citizens or facilities are an intended target.""

"(CNN) -- The Catholic bishop of South Bend, Indiana, will not attend graduation ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame because he disagrees with the stem-cell research and abortion views of the commencement speaker -- President Obama. The University of Notre Dame says its invitation doesn't mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions. Bishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Fort Wayne, Indiana, as well as the university town, said Tuesday in a written statement that ""after much prayer"" he has decided not to attend the ceremony. ""President Obama has recently reaffirmed, and has now placed in public policy, his long-stated unwillingness to hold human life as sacred,"" D'Arcy said. ""While claiming to separate politics from science, he has in fact separated science from ethics and has brought the American government, for the first time in history, into supporting direct destruction of innocent human life."" Earlier this month, Obama reversed a federal ban on embryonic stem-cell research. Many scientists say the research could lead to advances in treating conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, while some abortion opponents believe destroying embryos in the research amounts to ending a human life.  Watch Obama called ""premier promoter of baby-killing"" » . In January, Obama lifted a Bush administration restriction on funding for organizations that provide or promote abortion overseas. D'Arcy's announcement comes as anti-abortion groups have launched campaigns attempting to persuade the Catholic university to rescind Obama's invitation. In a letter to Notre Dame, Anthony J. Lauinger, National Right to Life Committee vice president, called Obama ""the abortion president"" and said his invitation ""is a betrayal of the university's mission and an affront to all who believe in the sanctity and dignity of human life."" The conservative Cardinal Newman Society has launched a Web site -- notredamescandal.com -- that, according to the site, has drawn 50,000 signatures to a petition opposing Obama's appearance at the May 17 ceremony, at which Obama also is to receive an honorary degree. A White House statement released Tuesday said Obama is honored to be speaking at the university and welcomes the exchange of ideas on the hot-button topics. ""While he is honored to have the support of millions of people of all faiths, including Catholics with their rich tradition of recognizing the dignity of people, he does not govern with the expectation that everyone sees eye to eye with him on every position,"" the White House said. ""[T]he spirit of debate and healthy disagreement on important issues is part of what he loves about this country."" Obama will become the ninth sitting president to give the commencement speech at Notre Dame. Most recently, presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush have spoken there. In a written statement on Tuesday, Notre Dame President John I. Jenkins noted that the university has been host to Democratic and Republican presidents and said the invitation does not mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions. ""We will honor Mr. Obama as an inspiring leader who faces many challenges -- the economy, two wars, and health care, immigration and education reform -- and is addressing them with intelligence, courage and honesty,"" he said. ""It is of special significance that we will hear from our first African-American president, a person who has spoken eloquently and movingly about race in this nation. ""Racial prejudice has been a deep wound in America, and Mr. Obama has been a healer."" On abortion and stem-cell research, Jenkins said he views the invitation as ""a basis for further positive engagement.""","Bishop John D'Arcy cites Obama's views about stem-cell research, abortion .

"(CNN) -- More than 50 children have been abducted in Haiti since the beginning of the year, adding to a trend of kidnappings in countries affected by violence, according to a United Nations Children's Fund report. Haitians demonstrate June 4 in Port-au-Prince against the kidnappings and acts of violence in Haiti. ""It is everyone's duty to ensure children are safe from harm, and governments have a responsibility to enact and enforce measures that provide a protective environment for all children,"" the agency said in a statement released Friday. In countries torn by war, like the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iraq, food shortages and poverty have added to the already hellish conditions children live in. The youngest in unstable countries have become primary targets for armed groups who see them as commodities, the agency said. In Haiti, UNICEF and local officials report that kidnapped children are being raped, tortured and murdered. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti has been working with the national police force to try to halt such crimes. They suspect that criminal gangs are responsible. The agency reports that as many as 2,000 children a year are trafficked to the Dominican Republic, often with their parents' support. And about 1,000 children are working as spies, messengers or soldiers for armed gangs in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. Earlier in the month, a demonstration was held in Haiti's capital after a 16-year-old hostage was murdered and other hostages had been raped and lynched, including infants, UNICEF said. The agency urged officials to take action. ""There is no acceptable motive or rationale for these crimes, as there is no acceptable excuse that they should be allowed to continue with flagrant impunity,"" UNICEF's Haiti representative, Annamaria Laurini, said in a statement. The agency recently received reports that Iraqi children have been recruited by militia and insurgent groups. ""Girls are increasingly subject to murder, kidnapping and rape, or are being abducted and trafficked within or outside Iraq for sexual exploitation,"" according to the report. In the Central African Republic, the agency reports that armed gangs terrorize farms and communities, kidnapping children and holding them for ransom. Souleimane Garga, in Paoua, recounts to UNICEF how bandits broke into his home nearly two years ago and kidnapped his wife, newborn baby and two other children -- Harouna and Beldo -- after killing older family members, including an uncle and a grandfather. ""It was two in the morning when they came. There were many of them, and they knocked down the doors,"" Garga tells UNICEF in a video posted on the agency's Web site. Garga was shot in the back during the attack, UNICEF said. ""They had Kalashnikovs, and the bullets came down like rain,"" he said. For two years, now-5-year-old Harouna and his 7-year-old sister, Beldo, were held in bush camps because their father couldn't afford to be in a position where he might have to pay a ransom. It had financially broken him when he paid to free his wife and newborn baby, UNICEF said. Garga tells UNICEF that the children lived in horrible conditions that included beatings. ""Harouna still wakes up at night; he shouts and cries."" When someone mentions kidnapping, Beldo stops talking. ""Whenever she hears that word, she stops talking; she tells us to 'keep quiet of such things' and asks for peace,"" her father said. ""We were afraid, but we kept thinking our father would come soon,"" Harouna told the agency. ""'I'm happy to come back home. ... Thanks, we're free.'"" Although some children are returned to their homes, other kidnapped children may never return. They are instead used as muscle behind rebel militias in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The agency added that many children are also held in captivity and used as sexual slaves. In a July 2006 UNICEF report on child soldiers in the nation, the agency reported that ""as many as 30,000 children may be associated with armed forces or groups as fighters, sexual slaves and camp-followers."" Of those children, the report estimates, ""30 to 40 percent of children associated with armed forces are girls.""","UNICEF: Children are often victims of murder, kidnappings in war-torn nations .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Jackie Chan: A-list Asian megastar, iconic kung fu hero to millions and basically a really famous guy. We had been pursuing an in-depth interview with him for months through ""The JC Group,"" Jackie's all-conquering management company. Gaining access to Jackie Chan's personal ""museum"" uncovered many gems during filming. Schedules conflicted, dates came and went - then finally a breakthrough. He was setting aside an afternoon in between a dizzying array of international commitments. Better still, we would be filming in Jackie's Hong Kong den -- his office which is home to a private ""museum"" of memorabilia and awards collected over the years. Jackie Inc. is a sprawling, multi-tentacled empire with offices all over the world - but his hideaway is in a particularly charmless area of Hong Kong. Once inside the dreary office block, you pass a team of people working on JC merchandise and into Jackie's inner sanctum. The first thing that confronts you is the ordered chaos in his suite of rooms. Clearly incapable of throwing anything away, his office is littered with props, costumes, trophies (including several for his bowling skills), CDs, and -- some might say -- junk. He is also a compulsive collector. As he later tells us, if a friend gives him a gift such as a tea cup, he begins amassing tea cups until he has to build glass display cases to house his out-of-control collection. Another obsession is antique locks, including one vast, heavy model he hand-carried back from Turkey. Our first sighting of Jackie is odd. We were told he is a very late riser and the main challenge of the shoot for his staff was getting him out of bed. Instead, he arrives early, unannounced and on his own - a rarity with film stars. We are still setting up and he stares at us blankly through thick glasses, then disappears into his gym without a word. We begin to wonder if he actually knows about the interview. Introductions are finally made and the effusive, likeable Jackie Chan is alive and well. He throws himself into the idea of us filming him working out - putting on a bright yellow sweat suit, then pouring out the sweat from his sleeve after 40 minutes on the cross trainer. During the interview, he is animated and a great story teller, discussing brushes with the triads and the last time he saw Bruce Lee alive. As China's Olympic poster boy, he was clearly uncomfortable discussing Tibet and drew the distinction between sport and politics currently favored by the IOC. Our eventual guided tour took in his room of autographed film star photographs (Robert De Niro his most treasured) and his personal walk-in wine chiller, which was naturally behind a false wall. His business drive is evident. His merchandising arm produces clothes, glasses and Jackie Chan action figures, while he also dabbles in gizmos that interest him - he owns the distribution rights to the Segway in Hong Kong and cheerfully taught Anjali how to ride one. Exhausted, we took our leave after a five hour shoot while Jackie still appeared to be warming up. The following day he left for Japan - ahead of Olympic duties on the Great Wall of China and a quick skip over to India. Unarguably ""the hardest working man in showbusiness"" -- when awake.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Felony fraud charges against actor Randy Quaid and his wife, Evi, were dropped Wednesday after she accepted a deal on a misdemeanor offense, a California prosecutor said. The Quaids were facing felony charges of defrauding an innkeeper and skipping out on a $10,000 hotel bill in Santa Barbara, California, in September 2009. The couple have paid the bill in full, according to Santa Barbara County Deputy District Attorney Arnie Tolks. After Evi Quaid entered a plea of no contest to one misdemeanor count of defrauding an innkeeper, she was sentenced to three years probation and 240 hours of community service, Tolks said. The Quaids were first arrested in Texas in September on a warrant issued by a Santa Barbara judge. They missed several court dates since then, prompting the judge to order them to jail on Monday unless they posted $100,000 bail each, which they did. After the couple showed up for a court hearing on Monday, their lawyer negotiated a plea deal. While investigators had circumstantial evidence against Randy Quaid, they could not prove his direct involvement in dealing with the hotel or the credit card transaction, Tolks said. Evidence showed it was Evi Quaid who handled the business with the hotel, he said. Quaid, 56, is known for his roles in several films, including the ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" movies, ""Kingpin"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" His younger brother is actor Dennis Quaid. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Felony charges dropped against actor and his wife .

"(CNN) -- Former Weather Underground militant Bill Ayers will appear at the University of Wyoming on Wednesday after a federal judge ruled he can't be barred from speaking on campus. U.S. District Judge William Downes ordered Tuesday that the university must take ""all prudent steps"" to guarantee Ayers' security at his lecture. The university had argued that ""serious threats"" prompted it to cancel the appearance by Ayers, who is now a University of Illinois education professor. Downes' two-page order requires university officials to take ""all prudent steps to maintain order and provide for the security of participants and spectators."" University officials won't appeal the order, said spokeswoman Jessica Lowell. University President Tom Buchanan said the school ""will do everything in our power to provide a safe and secure environment for his visit."" Ayers became a footnote to the 2008 presidential campaign because of his history of violent opposition to the Vietnam War and his acquaintance with then-candidate Barack Obama. Some prominent Republicans suggested that Ayers was a shadowy influence on Obama during his 2008 presidential bid. GOP presidential candidate John McCain urged Obama to ""come clean"" about his relationship with Ayers and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin accused Obama of ""palling around with terrorists."" Ayers and Obama served on the Annenberg Challenge board and on the board of another Chicago, Illinois, charitable foundation, the Woods Fund, in the 1990s. A CNN review of the two men's history found nothing inappropriate in their dealings, and Ayers later called the attacks ""a profoundly dishonest narrative."" David Lane, a lawyer for Ayers and University of Wyoming student Meghan Lanker, called Tuesday's ruling ""inspirational"" and ""a huge victory for the First Amendment."" Ayers was scheduled to speak on education issues at the university in early April, but the longstanding invitation drew controversy as the date neared. Republican candidates for governor condemned the school for inviting him, and in court papers Lanker stated she was told Ayers' appearance ""would inflame public sentiments"" and hurt the university. But university officials said they pulled the plug because they had ""serious threats and other information concerning potential violence"" and argued that Ayers could speak freely somewhere else. ""The UW administration did not bar Ayers from campus, but denied permission to rent space for a large event on university property because of serious security concerns,"" Buchanan said on the school's website. Ayers was a leader of the Weather Underground, a radical anti-war group that claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon and about 20 other targets. No one died in those attacks, though three Weather Underground members blew themselves up building another bomb in 1970. Ayers and his wife, fellow Weather Underground member Bernadine Dohrn, spent a decade on the run before surrendering to authorities in 1980. The charges against him were dropped due to illegal wiretaps and prosecutorial misconduct.","Federal judge orders university to allow ex-radical William Ayers to speak .

"University Park, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The fatal explosions at the Upper Big Branch coal mine in West Virginia and the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the Louisiana coast drive home important truths about our country's energy supplies. The first is that energy extracted from these sources is so valuable for our society that companies can afford to pay their workers premiums to risk their lives in dangerous circumstances. Massey Coal was extracting coal at Upper Big Branch at a cost of $35 per ton, and selling it for $60 per ton. BP and Transocean were extracting oil from Deepwater Horizon at a cost of $50 per barrel and selling it for $80 per barrel . The second is that there are no simple solutions to U.S. energy challenges. Wherever we get our energy, the price we pay for it is high. We should consider this seemingly obvious fact when we talk about moving toward an economy that uses less carbon in order to combat climate change. Make no mistake: This move will be costly and is not likely to happen any time soon. Scholars at Resources for the Futures, a Washington, D.C., environmental think tank, estimate that enactment of the Waxman-Markey bill (the American Clean Energy and Security Act) currently pending before the Senate will cost the average ratepayer anywhere from $136 to $413 per year. The reality is our economy is set up to burn coal for electricity and gasoline for cars, and moving away from this will be difficult, time consuming, and will compel consumers to decide whether they think it is worth it. Almost half of the electricity produced in the United States comes from coal, which is cheap, plentiful and secure. Yet besides the dangers to coal miners, coal comes with its own costs. Burning it for electricity creates sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. Scientists and engineers are working on making coal cleaner. One promising approach is carbon sequestration, in which carbon is separated out after burning coal. But once the carbon is separated, it is not clear what will be done with it. The best ideas involve storing it underground in former natural gas reservoirs. Making such storage facilities viable, however, will involve laying pipelines to transport highly compressed carbon dioxide hundreds of miles, likely against strong local opposition. Thus, for the foreseeable future, we are going to be using a lot of dirty coal. Oil has its own deficiencies in terms of pollution and safety of extraction. Burning oil creates a variety of noxious chemicals, as well as carbon dioxide. And, as the oil spill from Deepwater Horizon demonstrates, we will never be able to eliminate environmental threats from drilling. But right now, it is the only thing we have to propel most of our cars. Someday, electric cars may be able to take us farther than the local shopping mall. But even then, we'll have to get the needed power from an already overburdened electricity grid. Many have held up wind and solar power as the saving solutions for our energy future. But these energy sources, which provide about 2 percent of the nation's electricity, have their own drawbacks and hurdles. For example, promising offshore wind projects have been canceled because of local environmental concerns. Indeed, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar is scheduled to make a decision on a wind power project off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts this week that has faced opposition from fisherman, local Indian tribes and tourism concerns. After years of discussion, there have still been no offshore wind turbines built in the U.S. And by itself, solar power is clean. But the needed rare-earth elements (such as dysprosium and terbium) are extracted through processes that are less than green. For example, extracting the elements from the raw materials mined requires a great deal of difficult-to-dispose-of and highly dangerous acids. (Rare-earth elements are also used in hybrid car motors.) Further, these elements come from China, giving the Chinese government power over our energy policies. But beyond that, there may be limits -- at least for the foreseeable future -- to how much our electricity grid can depend on wind and solar power. This all revolves around a particular word: ""intermittency."" A modern society requires that nonstorable electricity be available at all times to meet electricity demand, without a significant threat of blackouts. Unfortunately, wind and solar power are intermittent -- they depend on weather conditions, which can vary. Given this, there is a serious question as to how much the electricity grid can rely on these energy sources. Whether consumers will be willing to pay for green energy remains an open question. One example comes from Pennsylvania's restructured electricity markets. In these markets, residential customers have the option of paying for ""green"" power, mostly from wind sources, and somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of residential customers do so. This green power, however, raises electricity bills about 15 to 20 percent. Moving toward a greener economy will further raise these costs, as it will become harder and harder to find green power sources. If we want to address our country's energy concerns, we have to be willing to face one important fact: that creating such solutions will not be cheap. Different forms of energy are available, but using them will result in raising our electricity and gasoline bills significantly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Kleit.","Andrew Kleit says recent coal and oil extraction disasters point up truth of our energy needs .
Coal mining, oil drilling are costly, dangerous, but economy bound to it, he says, for cars, electricity .
Switch to low-carbon sources not imminent, he says; it's expensive, has own problems .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congressional Republicans offered what they call a ""centrist, practical"" plan to overhaul the U.S. health care system Tuesday, one they say would be the cheapest of any option proposed so far. House Republicans say their health care plan is a better package than the Senate version. Illinois Rep. Mark Kirk said the package put together by moderate Republicans in the House of Representatives would be far cheaper than a plan being drawn up in the Senate. A preliminary review of that plan by the Congressional Budget Office found it would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years to extend health insurance to 16 million people who otherwise would not be covered -- about a third of the roughly 45 million now uninsured. ""I think this plan that we put forward is more centrist, more bipartisan and would be at significantly lower cost,"" Kirk said. He said no cost estimate had been prepared for the measures he put forth Tuesday, but asserted its elements would require less money from taxpayers than other proposals. The package announced by the GOP ""Tuesday Group"" includes some perennial Republican favorites such as regulatory relief, an individual tax break for purchasing health insurance and limits on malpractice lawsuits. It also would encourage insurers to pool their coverage to a greater extent than currently allowed, which Kirk and other supporters say has worked well in California. But it also emphasizes preventive care, computerizing patient records and reducing ""defensive medicine"" by promoting treatments proven effective -- all principles the White House has endorsed, as well. The centerpiece of the plan, Kirk said, is a ""Medical Rights Act"" that would keep government out of ""decisions made by you and your doctor."" He said the plans were drawn up during four months of talks with dozens of groups, including patient advocates, doctors, nurses, employers and ""other interested groups."" The proposal came as the conservative GOP leadership in the House stepped up attacks on the proposal being drafted by Senate Democrats. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Monday's budget office report showed ""millions of Americans"" would lose their current insurance. ""President Obama says the problem with our health care is that we spend too much, and if you look at all the proposals, clearly they are going to spend trillions of dollars of additional money that we don't have -- that we're going to have to borrow -- in order to finance their scheme,"" Boehner told reporters. The report projected that the number of people covered by employer-based health care plans would fall by about 15 million by 2017. In the same year, about 39 million people would be covered by policies purchased through a health insurance ""exchange"" of the type Obama has proposed. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Tuesday that a bill is still being drafted and ""has many twists and turns to go."" ""One incomplete older proposal I don't think is indicative of where we are now,"" he said.","Rep. Mark Kirk says GOP proposal would be far cheaper than Senate plan .

"(CNN) -- The aid package being negotiated to bail out Greece is worth 120 billion euros (about $160 billion) through 2012, according to Vassilis Papadimitriou, a spokesman for Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou. But the International Monetary Fund and European Union are demanding further austerity measures as a price for the bailout, according to a top Greek labor union official. Greece will be required to cut civil servants' salaries, freeze their pay increases, reduce their pension payments, change tax rates and increase the value-added tax consumers pay on purchases, according to Ilias Iliopoulos, the general secretary of the public sector union ADEDY. The International Monetary Fund did not respond immediately to a CNN request for confirmation of the value of the package. Its head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said Wednesday the agency did not release information about deals in the works until they were done. ""Until we reach this point there is no precise information to give because the information doesn't exist,"" he said. Greece's credit rating has been slashed twice in the past two weeks -- most recently being downgraded to ""junk"" -- raising fears for the euro currency used by 16 nations across Europe. Markets worldwide tumbled when Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece earlier this week. It's the first European country to fall below investment grade. What Greece's debt rating downgrade means . The downgrade -- which makes it harder and more expensive for a country to borrow money -- was a major problem for Athens as it struggles to crawl out from beneath the country's massive debt. The national debt of 300 billion euros ($394 billion) is bigger than the country's economy, and some estimates predict it will reach 120 percent of gross domestic product in 2010. Germany is expected to contribute the lion's share of EU funding to bail out Greece. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday her country will do what it can to help Greece out of its financial crisis, ""but also Greece has to do its part."" She was meeting with Strauss-Kahn to hammer out specifics of the deal. ""Obviously what Greece has to do is a difficult thing, but I think they are committed to doing it,"" he said in an appearance with the German leader. Merkel is being pulled in two directions -- toward bailing out Greece in order to stabilize the euro, and away from forking out cash because it is unpopular with German voters, with local elections coming up soon. Former Greek Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said Thursday that German taxpayers have nothing to worry about. ""German taxpayers are going to make money"" when Greece repays the loans, he said on CNN's ""Quest Means Business."" ""Greece will never default,"" he added. He said the country needed the aid package because it no longer had the options it used to have for raising funds. ""The markets have closed, we cannot rely on the markets as we have relied on the markets for so many years,"" he said. Standard & Poor's slashed Spain's debt to a ""AA"" rating Wednesday, down from ""AA+,"" as Merkel and Strauss-Kahn focused on Greece. Who are the credit rating agencies? Spain's economy is among the largest in the European Union, significantly bigger than Greece's. Greek civil servants and private sector workers are planning a 24-hour strike May 5 to protest government austerity measures, the unions announced Wednesday. Sporadic demonstrations have already taken place in several cities, with sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters angry about the coming changes. Journalist Mary Retiniotis contributed to this report.","IMF, EU are seeking further austerity measures, Greek spokesman says .

"(CNN)  -- Green living is a spiritual calling for a group of Christian women in the upper Midwest. Call it a heavenly approach to being good stewards of the Earth. While most people don't think about sustainable buildings in a spiritual light, the Benedictine Women of Madison, Wisconsin, believe they should. The ecumenical order's new Holy Wisdom Monastery scored the highest number of points ever awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system for new construction. Holy Wisdom Monastery is run by three Benedictine sisters.  The idea that they wanted to build the most sustainable, cutting-edge, eco-friendly building in the United States is surprising to some; but given the order's mission, it's an obvious fit for the women. ""People who know us see it as falling out of our mission. They see it as something they would expect from us,"" Sister Mary David Walgenbach said. One of the order's core values is ""Care for the Earth."" ""People who don't know us, who come into the building, are surprised by its elegance and simplicity. And they ask the same question: 'Why would a small community of women do such a thing?'"" said Walgenbach. ""But when we talk to them about who we are and why we think it's important to do this, and, in our day and age, why it's even more important that our religious people think about caring of the Earth, then they're very open to that."" Also surprising: the building's sustainability statistics. Holy Wisdom Monastery sits on 130 rural acres, just outside Madison. The original building, once a Catholic high school for girls, was torn down and 99.75 percent of the material was either reused or recycled. Hoffman LLC designed and built the monastery at a cost of $246 per square foot, or just over $7.5 million for demolition through construction. ""There's a long list of reasons this building is the greenest in the U.S. right now,"" said company owner Paul Hoffman. ""For one, the building is projected to save at least 60 percent on energy costs alone."" That's because the heating and cooling systems are powered by 39 geothermal wells, closed-loop wells sunk deep in the earth. Hoffman says the geothermal wells work so efficiently that on some days, the monastery actually sells energy to the utility, instead of buying it. Photovoltaic lights, which are cells that convert sunlight into electricity, are used in the parking lot. Another set of photovoltaic cells on the monastery's roof generates 15 percent of the building's energy needs. Eventually the monastery hopes to generate all of its own energy from on-site renewable sources. The windows in the monastery are unique. They were specially designed for the building using a new technique. ""We used Andersen wood windows and they developed a special highly sustainable window with special glazing,"" Hoffman said. ""So there's absolutely no blinds, shades, or draperies in the building because the glass is the thing that transmits the light, but eliminates the glare, yet grabs the solar heat gains."" Hoffman hired the green consulting firm Vertegy, based in St. Louis, Missouri, to help coordinate the many complex aspects involved in constructing a sustainable building and completing the very complicated U.S. Green Building Council LEED certification process. Construction methods for a green building are very different from traditional ones, according to Thomas Taylor, Vertegy's general manager. ""The person who designs the structure of the building, the person who designs the mechanical systems like the air conditioning, the people who design the plumbing, and even the outside landscape, they all have to work together,"" he said. ""In recent times in design and construction, they haven't worked together. They've worked kind of in a bubble."" Then, Taylor added, ""one person brings it all together, puts it on a drawing and then the contractor goes out and builds it."" That process doesn't work very well for green projects, he said. ""This is a situation where we tried to take the talents of all those people, integrate them so they're doing their work at one time, and they're really being mindful of each other and supportive of each other's disciplines and needs, in order to maximize the energy efficiency, the water efficiency, the impact on the environment that their own discipline might have"" as the building is being constructed, Taylor said. While the monastery officially opened last August, the Benedictine sisters just found out last month their building achieved the highest LEED Platinum rating ever awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council for a new construction building, 63 out of a possible 69 points. And that gives the Benedictine sisters a heavenly end to their monastery construction project.","Benedictine Women in Wisconsin win award for greenest new building in U.S.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Ailing President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua has returned home to Nigeria, though it was not immediately clear whether he was well enough to resume duties. Abdullah Aminchi, Nigeria's ambassador to Saudi Arabia -- where Yar'Adua has been receiving medical treatment since November -- said the president's health had improved considerably and that he went back to Nigeria on Tuesday. He was treated for inflammation of tissue around the heart, a condition that was diagnosed last fall after he complained of chest pain. He was taken to King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he had undergone his last checkup in August, his doctor said . His absence had created a power vacuum in Africa's most populous nation, observers said. It also sparked demonstrations in the nation's capital, Abuja, where protesters demanded a constitutional order on his absence and evidence about his true state of health. Explainer: Will Nigeria's leader return to power? As a fix, Nigerian lawmakers voted earlier this month to install the country's Vice President Goodluck Jonathan as head of state. A statement from the U.S. assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of African Affairs Wednesday welcomed the news of Yar'Adua's return, but said he hoped that it was not ""an effort by his senior advisors to upset Nigeria's stability and create renewed uncertainty in the democratic process."" ""Nigeria is an extraordinarily important country to its friends and partners, and all those in positions of responsibility should put the health of the president and the best interests of the country and people of Nigeria above personal ambition or gain,"" said the statement from Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson.

"(CNN)  -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday approved the nation's first offshore wind farm, signing off on a project that has bitterly divided Cape Cod over the last nine years. The 130 turbines are to be located several miles from the Massachusetts shore in the iconic waters of Nantucket Sound. The interior secretary said Cape Wind, as the project is known, is the start of a ""new energy frontier."" ""The United States is leading a clean energy revolution that is reshaping our future,"" Salazar told reporters in Boston. ""Cape Wind is an opening of a new chapter in that future, and we are all part of that history."" ""Cape Wind will be the nation's first offshore wind farm, supplying clean power to homes and businesses in Massachusetts, plus creating good jobs here in America,"" he said. ""This will be the first of many projects up and down the Atlantic coast."" ""Thank you for this decision,"" said Gov. Deval Patrick. ""With this project, Massachusetts will lead the nation. This day has been a long time coming."" The location of the wind farm has stirred heated emotions over the years. Cape Wind became one of the most heavily vetted energy projects in the world. Seventeen state and federal agencies weighed in, reviewing everything from its impact on shipping, aviation and fisheries. Salazar visited the Cape earlier this year. At the time, he pledged to cut through the nine years of regulatory red tape and make a final decision by the end of April. At Wednesday's news conference, the interior secretary said the process took far too long and future offshore projects would follow a ""more rational and orderly"" process. There is no reason, he said, ""why an offshore wind permit should take a decade to review and approve."" The most notable opponent of Cape Wind was the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a champion of green energy who, to the dismay of environmentalists, fought against the wind farm. The Kennedy compound will have a view of the wind turbines. See how the views on the Cape will change . Other opponents ranged from billionaire energy giant William Koch to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. American Indians in the region also objected, saying the wind farm would be located on sacred ancestral grounds and disturb important sunrise ceremonies. ""I am strongly opposed to the administration's misguided decision to move forward with Cape Wind,"" Sen. Scott Brown said Wednesday. ""While I support the concept of wind power as an alternative source of energy, Nantucket Sound is a national treasure that should be protected from industrialization."" In announcing his decision, Salazar said Cape Wind must follow stringent measures during construction, and it must conduct additional marine and archeological assessments of its impact. The company must also explore ways to make the wind turbines less visible from shore. ""The smart responsible development of wind potential on Horseshoe Shoal need not conflict with the history and tradition of Nantucket Sound,"" Salazar said. Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and nearly every major environmental group in the nation supported the project, saying it's necessary in moving the nation forward. Six governors in the region also backed Cape Wind. ""Even though we enjoy overwhelming majority support, it's not a popularity contest,"" Cape Wind CEO Jim Gordon told CNN. ""This decision needs to be made on the merits. And the record shows that it is in the public interest."" In an editorial today, the Boston Globe said simply: ""Make clean energy a reality; approve Cape Wind now."" The New York Times earlier this week also endorsed the project. ""Offshore wind farms are a common sight in Europe but not here,"" the Times wrote. ""Cape Wind would be this country's first -- sending, finally, a signal to the world about America's resolve to fight global warming and reduce its dependence on foreign oil."" The wind farm would bring hundreds of jobs and provide up to 75 percent of the power needed by the Cape and islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, according to Cape Wind. Estimates of the project have ranged from $800 million to $1 billion; Cape Wind has not released how much it believes the wind farm will cost. See the location of the wind farm . The 130 turbines, spaced a third- to a half-mile apart, will cover about 25 of the 500 square miles of Nantucket Sound. They will stand more than 40 stories tall, well over 10 times bigger than nearly every other structure around the Cape. Cape Wind has said the project will not necessarily bring cheaper energy, but will bring cleaner electricity and become a model for offshore wind energy. The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, the project's chief nemesis, has vowed to file suit to continue to try to block it. The project already has withstood multiple court challenges. Buddy Vanderhoop, a member of the Wampanoag Tribe, harshly criticized the decision to go ahead with the project. ""This is a federal embarrassment and a slap in the face not only to the tribes ... but it's also a slap in the face to the people who make their living"" off fishing in the area of the wind farm's location, Vanderhoop said. Barbara Hill has long supported Cape Wind as the executive director of the grassroots organization Clean Power Now. ""We're going to be partying later on tonight,"" she said. ""We applaud Secretary Salazar for his vision and leadership in making this landmark decision and look forward to the day when the wind farm in Nantucket Sound will be producing the majority of the electrical needs of the Cape and islands."" Wind farms produce roughly 2 percent of the nation's energy, all from land-based facilities in California, Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming and a few other states. Locations offshore are considered optimal because the winds are stronger and more consistent. A 2008 Energy Department report calls for ""20 Percent Wind Energy by 2030."" It said 18 percent of the nation's wind energy should come from offshore sites. Cape Wind first sought a permit in fall 2001. During that time, China built its first offshore wind farm. Nine other countries have offshore farms: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. On Wednesday, Gov. Patrick said Cape Wind will now allow the United States to join the offshore wind race.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Glynis McCants looks at Michael Jackson's life, she sees the number five. Numerologist Glynis McCants says that with his numbers, Jackson was a draw to fans. Jackson's talent was discovered when he was 5 years old, he came to fame as a member of the Jackson 5 and he planned a series of 50 concert dates in London, England, as part of a comeback tour before he died on June 25 at the age of 50. For McCants, a noted numerologist and author, those facts are very telling: ""Five is the number for drama, and it was in his life his whole life."" For many fans, the lure of Michael Jackson as a performer and pop icon was magical. Those who deal in the paranormal are tuned in to that magic. Numerology deals with the influence of numbers on personal characteristics and human affairs. McCants -- who has appeared on nationally syndicated television and radio shows and is known as the ""Numbers Lady"" -- said that by taking Jackson's birth date (August 29, 1958, or 8/29/1958) she could chart his personality. His was ""six life path,"" she said, meaning he was magnetic and drew people to him. That, coupled with the fact that he was born on a two day made him irresistible, she said. ""If you are born on a two day and are a six life path then America and the world seem to fall in love with you,"" McCants said. ""It's almost as if you always get a shot with that energy if you shoot for stardom, and then you can sabotage it,"" McCants said. ""Britney Spears was born on a two day, and she's a six life path; Lindsay Lohan was born on a two day, and she's a six life path; and Sarah Palin was born on a two day, and is a six life path."" Such people, McCants said, thrive on the attention. Psychic Eddie Conner said Jackson couldn't help but attract such attention, even if it resulted in a life of isolation. ""He's an old soul with an enormous amount of creative artistic energy that pours to him and from him,"" said Conner, who works as a ""soul intuitive"" in Los Angeles, California, and whose clients include celebrities he declines to name. ""Whenever he's doing his magic he's untouchable, and I think that's the reason everybody gravitates toward him."" And despite all of Jackson's troubles, Conner said he believes the star will have an opportunity at success and fame again. Unlike other souls that stay in the nonphysical realm anywhere from 70 to 150 years, he said, he believes the singer's soul will return quickly -- within the next 20 years -- because Jackson was such a perfectionist that he will want to ""pick up where he left off."" ""If not as a performer, then a Quincy Jones/Michael Jackson/whoever, the top producers that get mass [music] out to the world to uplift them,"" Conner said. Fans continue to gravitate toward Jackson even as they try to make sense of his passing because mourning him reinvigorates the energy and attention surrounding him, Conner said. ""He was untouchable when he was connected to his soul and what he came to this planet to do,"" Conner said. ""The average person looks at that and they believe that if they can touch it -- or have him touch them -- then maybe some of it would rub off."" The desire for such a connection can cause devastation now that Jackson is gone, said psychic consultant Jack Rourke, who has worked extensively in paranormal research and consulted for major Hollywood studios. ""Even though we've never met Michael, people create a symbiotic relationship with this image or this person,"" Rourke said. ""We project all of the positive aspects of ourselves, all of the wonderful things onto this image of perfection or near perfection that we see, and we imagine subconsciously that this person is in agreement with the deepest part of ourselves. ""When this is no longer possible because this person is gone, it creates a vacuum within us, so people need to maintain a psychological or even a spiritual stability by creating a fixed image of Jackson,"" he said. Rourke said he fully expects people to come forward claiming to have communicated with Jackson, but that any credible professional psychic or medium will not attempt to connect with Jackson for at least six months to a year and will only do so at the behest of a family member or an intimate friend of the singer. In the meantime, Conner said fans can still reach out to the singer's energy in a simple way: ""The greatest way to connect with Michael is through listening to his music.""","Numerologist says Michael Jackson's numbers add up to charisma .

"(Oprah.com) -- In 1977, my friend Brenda and I went for dinner at a little Chinese restaurant called Empress Garden. She had the lemon chicken, I had the shrimp har kow, and we each had an egg roll because in 1977 you could eat sugar and fat and deep-fried everything without its signifying that the apocalypse is at hand. Our waiter placed the entrées in front of us and ceremoniously lifted the shiny silver domes. Brenda's chicken was crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside, lemony all over, and I knew in an instant that I'd made a hideous error in judgment --I should've gone with the chicken. I tell you this story to illustrate my willingness to admit when I've made a mistake. In fact, I've rarely ordered a breakfast, lunch, or dinner I didn't regret; at this very moment, I'm wishing I had an iced tea instead of a Diet Coke. But aside from the food thing and one very adorable guy in the early '80s who was all you'd want in a man except for the fact that he was also looking for all you'd want in a man, I am never, ever wrong. Now, I'm not saying I always take my own advice or trust my own instincts. I'm merely suggesting that the world would be a much better place if everyone else were to do exactly what I tell them to do. Arrogant? You bet. Narcissistic? I suppose. But c'mon, admit it, you've had the very same thought kicking around for years. Still, I'm the one with the column -- so now without further ado ... Everything I know about the world and how you (yes, you!) should live your life: . 1. If you can't get a babysitter, for the love of God, stay home! I don't want to be sitting next to little Charlotte and Duncan as they fight over a Raisinet at the midnight screening of Atonement. You wanted kids, so suck it up, walk it off, subscribe to Netflix. 2. If your outgoing phone message is longer than, let's say, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian of the Year segment of the Oscars®, it's time to rerecord. 3. Calling to let your friend know you're running late does not excuse your constantly running late. 4. I'd like to say a few words to every crabby traveler who responds with disgust whenever a baby cries on an airplane. Perhaps you don't know how babies work, but there's been a study, and it turns out that giving a 4-month-old the stink eye doesn't actually accomplish anything. Either have a little compassion or a little Ambien. 5. Here's something for any gentleman who may be reading this: If you look good in a Speedo, you will look even better in virtually any other kind of swimsuit. 6. I am a cynic. I am a pessimist. I came of age with the Watergate hearings playing on the tiny TV in our avocado green kitchen. But every four years, I wrestle my apathy into submission, read up on the issues, and cast my ballot. You must vote. I don't care who you vote for (that's not really true -- I think you should be penciling in my name), but you've gotta get in the game. 7. One word: Floss. 8. Any man who begins a conversation with, ""I don't want to hurt your feelings ... "" is about to hurt your feelings. It's the kind of phrase that's never followed by, ""... but I just don't think you're eating enough. Please have more lasagna while I get you a brownie."" Other opening gambits that pretty much scream duck-and-cover include: ""Don't take this the wrong way... ,"" ""You can feel free to say no ... ,"" and the always popular ""Look ... "" 9. Enough with celeb gossip. The problems of Britney and Jamie Lynn Spears should not be competing for the headline space in our brains. We have to be smarter than that, and if we're not, we have to pretend that we are. 10. Get so excellent at something (long division, friendship, Parcheesi, removing cranberry juice stains, decoupage -- it doesn't matter what) that your genius will be impossible to ignore and your legendary expertise at removing cranberry juice stains while dividing six-digit numbers by 37 will either bring you glory beyond your wildest dreams or, at the very least, help you feel vaguely competent as you make your way through the world. 11. Allow me to demystify the entire real estate market for you: Gracious means ridiculously small. Quaint means a total wreck and ridiculously small. Spacious, airy, luxurious, and grand all mean ridiculously small. 12. I like a plastic bag and a bottle of water as much as the next self-involved me monkey, but it takes 430,000 gallons of oil to manufacture 100 million grocery bags, and if I were capable of doing even the most basic arithmetic, I'd say -- well, who are we kidding? I'm not capable of doing even the most basic arithmetic -- just know that we're in great danger of making Al Gore really, really mad. 13. Words matter. It's time to stop prettifying the ugly stuff. Spousal abuse means wife beating. Global warming means the Earth is toast. Enhanced interrogation means torture. And here's a bit of trivia for you: The Bush administration did not coin the phrase enhanced interrogation. Nor did it come from Jack Bauer on ""24."" Nope, it was the Gestapo that originated that little bon mot back in 1937. 14. To quote Elmer Fudd, ""Be bwave, widdoe wabbit."" Take a chance, wear your heart on your sleeve, ask the most attractive man in the room to dance, say what you want, demand what you're entitled to. There's a pretty decent chance that you won't get it, but who will you be if you never even try? Note: Only attempt the dance invitation if there's actual music playing. 15. Sometimes I worry that we've all become workaholics -- because getting through life can be really hard work. But (with apologies to the fine people who pay my salary every week here at the fabulous Hearst Corporation) we need to log off, go home, and remember what it is to have dinner, conversation, and sex ... not necessarily in that order.

"(CNN) -- Peter Jackson, the Oscar-winning writer and director of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, was knighted in his native New Zealand. The knighthood was conferred on Jackson on Wednesday for his services to film at a ceremony at the Premier House in Wellington. New Zealand's head of state Gov. Gen. Sir Anand Satyanand honored Jackson in place of Queen Elizabeth II. New Zealand's knights and dames are sanctioned by the queen, the country's official head of state.

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- As president of the Pentagon Memorial Fund, Jim Laychak has been involved in nearly aspect of the project's planning. Stainless steel benches are oriented according to whether the victim was on the plane or in the Pentagon. The only thing he has not done is visit the bench dedicated to his brother, Dave Laychak, who died on September 11, 2001, when a passenger airplane hit the Pentagon. ""I want to hold off and go and see his bench and touch his bench that day,"" said Laychak. ""I wanted to save something special for me personally on September 11 when we dedicate the memorial, so I can spend some time with it then."" Laychak is one of many looking forward to the dedication of the memorial, which is being built to honor the 184 people killed when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. ""This is hallowed ground for a lot of the family members, and the essence of this place will be about them, those that we lost,"" Laychak said.  Watch how visitors react to the memorial » . After more than five years of fundraising, the organizers are about $13 million short of their goal. They plan to have the memorial finished and dedicated on the seventh anniversary of the attacks. The park, which cost $22 million to build, needs another $10 million in endowment funds to make sure it's always properly maintained. So far, the Pentagon Memorial Fund has raised $19 million from sources as diverse as former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, NBA star [and Navy veteran] David Robinson and the government of Taiwan. The focus of the memorial is 184 cantilevered benches built over a pool of lighted water. Each bench is engraved on the end with the name of one of the 184 people who died on board Flight 77 or in the Pentagon that day. The benches are arranged by age, with the bench of the youngest victim, 3-year-old Dana Falkenberg, in the far southeast corner and the bench honoring 71-year-old John Yamnicky in the northwest corner. For Wendy Ploger, whose father and stepmother died aboard Flight 77, the benches add special meaning to the memorial. ""I don't know how to describe it, but it tells the story of what happened, which is sort of what helps me to heal,"" said Ploger, whose relatives were on their honeymoon when they died. The benches for the 59 victims on board the plane are arranged so that someone reading the name on the end of the bench will face the sky where the plane came from. The 125 benches for the victims inside the Pentagon face the opposite direction, so someone reading the name will look up and see the south facade of the Pentagon, where the jet hit that day. ""The way the bench is facing, my father's bench, if you read his name on the end of it, you are facing the same direction that the plane was flying [from] as it impacted the Pentagon,"" said Ploger, whose parents were originally scheduled to take a different flight but changed their plans. ""At first I felt a little strange sitting on it. But then, it's comfort and it feels good and I feel like I'm close to my loved one,"" she said. Some of the original plans have changed since construction started in June 2006. Originally, the benches were to be made of aluminum. But aluminum can oxidize, leaving pits and white residue. The builders chose to use marine-grade stainless steel, which won't rust and can withstand the elements. The benches are inlaid with black and gold granite mined in Spain and cut in Canada. A perimeter wall around the park is built of the same Spanish granite. Black granite was originally chosen for the top of a perimeter wall around the park, but builders learned the hard way that on warm and sunny days, the black granite gets so hot ""it could burn your tuchis,"" one worker said. Ploger and Laychak say they are not sure how others will respond to the memorial, but for them, it brings a sense of peace. ""For me, it just makes it so real,"" Ploger said. ""This is sort of the closest I've been to the event and to that day.""","Pentagon memorial slated for dedication on seventh anniversary of attack .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan came from behind to win for the second time in a week to keep their Italian title hopes alive with a 3-1 victory over relegation-threatened Atalanta on Saturday. Jose Mourinho's team followed up the stunning midweek victory over European champions Barcelona to move two points clear of second-placed Roma, who host Sampdoria on Sunday. But key Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder is in doubt for the second leg of the Champions League semifinal in Spain on Wednesday after coming off at halftime with a thigh injury. Atalanta, third from bottom with three matches to play, took a shock fifth-minute lead through Simone Tiribocchi but Inter hit back with three unanswered goals as they did against Barca. Argentina striker Diego Milito scored his 20th Serie A goal of the season to level with a lob in the 24th minute, then Kenyan midfielder McDonald Mariga scored his first for the defending champions with a shot that deflected in off teammate Sulley Muntari. Cristian Chivu, playing at left-back in a revamped defense due to absent Brazilian right-back Maicon's dental problems, sealed victory with 13 minutes to play with a super long-range shot to extend the Nerazzurri's unbeaten home run to 40 league games. The Romanian was delighted after scoring his first goal for Inter following his move from Roma in 2007. ""We're pleased with the victory. It wasn't easy because we were behind, but we knew how to react,"" he told the club's Web site. ""It was an important goal for me and the team: for me because it hasn't been an easy period for me, and for the team because we have to keep winning until the end. Roma's game tomorrow? I won't watch it. The last time I watched Roma, they won. ""From tomorrow we will start thinking about Barcelona. It's a historic moment for us. We have to give our all."" Third-placed AC Milan crashed to a 3-1 defeat at European hopefuls Palermo in Saturday's late match, and now trail their city rivals by nine points with three matches to play. Palermo moved above Sampdoria into fourth spot after going 2-0 up in the first 18 minutes with goals from defender Cesare Bovo and Uruguayan striker Abel Hernandez. Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf pulled one back for the visitors 10 minutes after halftime, but striker Fabrizio Miccoli restored the Sicilians' two-goal cushion on 66.","Inter Milan go two points clear of second-placed Roma with 3-1 win over lowly Atalanta .

"(CNN) -- A rabbi walks into St. Peter's Square, meets the pope, and tells the Holy Father that one way to defuse the sex abuse scandal plaguing the church is for the Vatican to begin promoting a secular version of Shabbat dinner, the traditional Jewish Friday meal. It's no joke. A prominent American rabbi, Shmuley Boteach, spoke briefly to Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday about encouraging parents to eat dinner with their children as a way for the Vatican to re-establish its pro-family image, which has been battered by the priest sex abuse scandal, Boteach said. The brief exchange came after the pope's regular Wednesday address at the Vatican, during which Boteach was seated on a dais along with other Vatican guests. When he met Benedict on a receiving line afterward, Boteach pitched him on his family dinner initiative, called ""Turn Friday Night into Family Night."" ""I said ... 'If the church embraces an initiative like this, which is positive, it could put a lot of the scandal behind it,'"" Boteach said, recounting his chat with the pope. ""People will see the church doesn't just speak about opposition to gay marriage and abortion.'"" The pope appeared to be receptive to the idea, Boteach said. "" 'We have to work together on this, we have to work together on this,' "" Boteach quoted the pope as saying. But, Benedict did not make a firm commitment to the family dinner initiative, the rabbi said. The Vatican was not immediately available for comment. ""The church is now perceived as not being a champion of families because the scandal has hit with so much force,"" Boteach said. ""I came (to the Vatican) as a friend and as someone who is critical as well. Because my criticism is real, the church knows my friendship is real."" Following his talk with the pope, Boteach said he was invited to meet with Cardinal Walter Kasper, who spearheads the Vatican's Jewish outreach, with whom Boteach fleshed out his criticism of the church's response to priestly sex abuse. Boteach was invited to the Vatican to look over documents related to Pope Pius XII, the Holocaust-era church leader who Benedict has signaled he would like to move closer to sainthood. The rabbi has been a spiritual adviser to Michael Jackson, who died last year, and a frequent guest on Oprah Winfrey's talk show. A number of recent Vatican actions have caused tensions between the church and the Jewish world. Last year, Benedict lifted the excommunication of a Holocaust-denying bishop, Richard Williamson. Earlier this month, the pope's personal preacher compared the fury over sexual abuse within the church to anti-Semitism, though the priest, the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, later apologized. But Boteach has been impressed by the Vatican's overtures to him and to other Jewish leaders. ""I thinks he's a friend to the Jews -- a very close friend,"" Boteach said of the pope. Boteach said that the Vatican had shown him documents from its private archive showing that Pius XII, a controversial figure among Jews, rescued Italian Jews during the Holocaust. But Boteach remains critical of Pius, saying he displayed ""absolute silence in condemning the Nazi Holocaust outright, which might have gone to great lengths to prevent it."" The church has said that Pius would have put more Jews in danger by publicly condemning the Holocaust because it would have provoked the Nazis.","American rabbi Shmuley Boteach spoke to Pope Benedict XVI about dinner idea .

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho claims Barcelona's ""obsession"" with winning the Champions League on the ground of their arch-rivals Real Madrid will hinder their chances of beating his side in their semifinal second showdown. Inter hold a 3-1 lead going into Wednesday's match at the Nou Camp and Mourinho could not resist a pre-match swipe at the Catalan giants, who would become the first side to retain the Champions League in its present format. But Mourinho, an acknowledged master in pre-match ""mind games"", is convinced that the pressure of expectation will work against last season's triple winners. ""We have a team of older players, with many over 30, and we hope that we will be able to cope with the atmosphere. It is one thing, though, to follow a dream and it is another to have an obsession,"" he told gathered reporters. Schalke's Magath set to work a new miracle . ""For Barca it is an obsession,"" added Mourinho, who was accompanied by tight security as he returned to the club where he began his coaching career under Bobby Robson. ""A dream is more pure than an obsession, an obsession is more about pride. Barca achieved a dream winning the Champions League in Paris and Rome last year but this time it is more about Madrid and playing at the Santiago Bernabeu, this is an obsession."" Mourinho, who claimed the Champions League during his spell at Portuguese giants Porto, realizes that Inter are also desperate to triumph in Europe's premier club competition having last won it in 1965. ""I can't say for me it is a personal dream as I have won it before but I want to win it for Inter as it is more than 40 years since they got to the final. ""If I can help Mr Moratti (the Inter president), if I can help the players and if I can contribute a little bit as coach to achieve this dream then I would be very happy."" Inter will be without the suspended Dejan Stankovic but Mourinho indicated that he would likely take a gamble on key midfielder Wesley Sneijder, who has a slight hamstring strain. ""We will see if he can play for 90 minutes as there is still a small problem. We have other important games in the league but I am ready to risk him as everything will be decided tomorrow,"" said Mourinho. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said his team were merely focused on earning a final clash against Bayern Munich, who beat Lyon 4-0 on aggregate in the first semifinal. ""It's a game of football, not a magic night, and we have to be ourselves -- we will go out and try to generate as many chances as we always do,"" he said. ""We don't know if we are capable of turning this around, but we will give everything against a great team to try and get to the final,"" he added.","Inter Milan hold 3-1 lead ahead of Champs League semifinal 2nd leg against Barcelona .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A disabled punk band has launched a campaign to fight for the rights of disabled people to be able to party late. Heavy Load are a UK-based punk band with three out of five members who are disabled. ""Heavy Load,"" describe themselves as an ""anarcho-garage-punk"" band and are  made up of five musicians, one of whom has Downs Syndrome and two who have unspecified learning disabilities. Their campaign, ""Stay Up Late,"" encourages carers to support disabled people who want to stay out past 10pm. Heavy Load's manager and bass guitarist, Paul Richards, 39, told CNN: ""The Stay Up Late"" campaign is to raise awareness, and tackle the issue where disabled gig-goers end up going home at 9pm, therefore missing most of the evening, because their support workers finish their shifts at 10pm. ""We started the campaign because we'd be playing a gig and something strange happens at 9pm when people would start to go home. We were also frustrated with asking to go on earlier in the evening so that our fans would still be there. It's not very punk to go on at 8.30pm,"" he added. ""Stay up Late"" has received widespread support from disabled people and the UK government, Richards said. Even carers who may be required to work later if the campaign is successful have offered their support. ""So far, we've only had one or two support workers say that they don't think they should be required to work unsociable hours,"" Richards said. The group has also partnered with the UK's leading learning disabilities charity Mencap, who they say have really helped to relay their message to a wider audience. Mencap and Heavy Load teamed up last week where the band headlined a concert in London for people with learning disabilities, giving them an opportunity to be involved in running a club night.  See images from the concert » . They concert was held in conjunction with London venue Proud Camden, and around 400 people attended the event which finished at 1am. Everyone at the event, from the door girl, to bar staff and cloakroom attendants, were people with learning disabilities, venue owner Alex Proud told CNN. ""It's the first event of its kind for people with a learning disability and there was a real buzz about how people with learning disability are an untapped source in the entertainment industry."" He said: ""At these nights there is a lack of inhibitions. They tend to let their hair down and really know how to party; it's a hell of a lot of fun for all involved. Proud is eager to put on events that include people with a learning disability and to make the public more aware of this often overlooked group. ""Young people with learning disabilities want to go out, but they are not catered for in the entertainment industry,"" he added. Heavy Load have been together for 13 years since meeting at the Southdown housing in England, a non-profit assisted-living community for people with learning disabilities. Vocalist Jimmy Nicholls, 62, posted an advert and a week later the band including Michael White, 47 (drums) Simon barker, 37 (lead vocals) and Mick Williams, 47 (guitar and vocals) was formed. Since then the band has gained many disabled and non-disabled fans and a successful documentary, ""Heavy Load,"" has been made about their lives. Now they are looking forward to setting up the ""Stay Up Late"" campaign around the world. Richards said: ""When we visited New York last year we were surprised to find that it's an issue for people with learning disabilities to get out much at all -- so there is definitely a need there. ""We've also been asked to go to Russia, Serbia, other parts of the U.S., Scotland and Czech Republic to play and promote the campaign -- which we'd love to do, but money's tight, "" he added. However, Richards insists the campaign is not about partying late every night. ""We don't insist on people staying up late against their will -- just having the choice to do what they want to do!""","Disabled punk bank Heavy Load have launched the ""Stay Up Late"" campaign .

"(CNN)  -- Glasgow Rangers won their 53rd Scottish title and ninth under manager Walter Smith as a 1-0 win over Hibernian on Sunday gave them an unassailable points advantage over city rivals Celtic. Kyle Lafferty scored his third goal in four games to secure the three points for Rangers, who were the defending champions. Earlier, Celtic beat Dundee United 2-0 with Senegalese striker Diomansy Kamara and Robbie Keane, with a last-minute penalty, scoring the goals. It was their fifth straight league win under interim manager Neil Lennon, but Rangers' title triumph was a formality which was confirmed later at Easter Road. Lafferty was on target after 17 minutes as Kenny Miller set him on his way to score with an angled drive. Smith, who won his first seven Scottish titles with Rangers in his first spell at the club, savored the latest victory which has come against the backdrop of financial worries and uncertainty over the future ownership of the famous club. ""You always feel grateful for the fact that you've won a trophy and you are in this position, as Rangers teams are a lot of the time,"" he told gathered reporters. In Bundesliga action on Sunday, Europa League semifinalists Hamburg were thrashed 5-1 at Hoffenheim. Strikers Chinedu Obasi and Vedad Ibisevic both scored twice for the hosts in the rout which followed Hamburg's goalless draw with Fulham in the first leg of their last four Europa clash on Thursday and ahead of next week's return. In Spain's La Liga, Valencia kept their third grip on third place with a 1-0 win over Deportivo la Coruna as David Villa scored a first half penalty. Athletico Madrid warmed up for their Europa League semifinal second leg against Liverpool by beating Tenerife 3-1, with Sergio Aguero scoring their third. Atletico lead Liverpool 1-0 going to Anfield on Thursday. A dramatic late penalty from Daniel Parejo gave Getafe a 4-3 victory over Sevilla in the late match in Spain. Sevilla could have taken advantage of Mallorca's surprise 1-1 draw against Malaga to claim fourth place.

"(CNN) -- In Pennsylvania, Tyler Dix, a 16-year-old movie buff, is wide awake by 7 a.m. to cook breakfast for his younger siblings. Moranda Hern and Kaylei Deakin started Sisterhood of the Traveling BDUs, or battle dress uniforms. In Georgia, Tucker Simmons, a 14-year old novice guitarist, prepares ice packs for his mother whenever her chronic lower back pain kicks in. In California, Kaylei Deakin, an avid 17-year old rock climber, disciplines her little sisters when they act out. Tyler, Tucker and Kaylei are three teenagers from across the country who have very different interests, but one experience that bonds them: They grew up fast -- sometimes too quickly -- to fill the shoes of mom or dad when their parent was shipped off to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the death toll from the two wars has risen over the last eight years, the fight has also affected a growing number of children left at home to cope without a parent. Whether it's raising their siblings or getting an after-school job, teens with parents in the military feel pressure to step up. ""These teens are expected to take on the responsibility the deployed parent used to take care of,"" said Mary Carolyn Voght, director of programs for Our Military Kids, a nonprofit organization that provides support to children with a deployed parent in the National Guard. ""There's usually the expectation that they will pitch in and help out more."" More than 30,000 teens between 12 and 18 have at least one parent in the National Guard deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense. When all military branches are taken into consideration, the American Psychological Association estimates about 700,000 children under the age of 18 have a parent deployed overseas for military duty. Playing mom and dad . ""This is nothing,"" said Tyler Dix modestly, describing his daily task of taking his 9-year-old sister Tayana to ballet and violin lessons and being a crying shoulder for his 13-year-old brother, Tevin, when he misses dad. ""It's a lot of responsibility, but I don't really have a choice. My dad told me I am the man of the house, and I have to act like it,"" he said. Last December, Tyler's father, Darryl Dix, was called to serve in Iraq. The family had a tearful goodbye at the Olive Garden, his father's favorite restaurant. Tyler talks to his father by phone, from once a week to several times, updating him on how the rest of the family is doing. If military teens adjust well to deployment, they can be more adaptive and resilient than their peers, said Angela Huebner, associate professor of human development at Virginia Tech. The wars have changed the military course for National Guard members, many who joined under the slogan ""one weekend a month, two weeks a year."" Guard member families say they anticipated their loved one would be gone occasionally to help with domestic disasters, but not to an international war that has lasted this long. Reserve Guard members are serving for longer periods of time -- up to 15 months -- and sometimes have multiple deployments. ""Multiple deployments have multiple effects,"" said Darrell Partee, chief of the service support division in the Georgia National Guard. ""It's not like this is a latchkey kid or a parent who is traveling on business. We may not know for a long time what kind of impact these deployments are having on our children."" Fifteen-year-old Tucker Simmons'  father was sent to Iraq in 2007 for three months, and will leave again next month. While his father was gone, he learned to fix leaky plumbing in the house. He comforted his younger sister Julia when the family cat passed away, holding her hand all the way home from the vet. Tucker says he missed hanging out with his father, joking around and playing Xbox games together. ""We chose the perspective that it's our duty to share our daddy,"" Tucker's mom Joy Simmons said. ""That feels much better than being sad all the time. But of course we miss him."" Coping without a parent . Deployment can cause a child to become depressed angry and isolated, some studies show. Last year, Department of Defense documents showed a spike in the number of military children who have undergone out-patient counseling since 9/11. Dealing with a parent's absence is no easier for teenagers, who are already confronting the growing pains of adolescence. ""All across the board, these kids are carrying an enormous burden,"" explained Patricia Barron, who runs the youth initiative programs at the nonprofit National Military Families Association. Kari McLevy of Jacksonville, Florida, recalled going through trouble after her mother, a single parent, was deployed to Iraq in 2007 for a year. Kari, 16 at the time, and her younger sister were sent to live with a family friend. Kari became reclusive and confused. It didn't help that the media was blitzed with images of war. Just a few months after her mother left, she was arrested for shoplifting. ""I pretty much realized I had to stop being a child,"" said Kari, who has graduated from high school. When her mother was at war, she got a job at a deli, saving up money to get her own apartment and attend community college. ""I can't just rely on my parents and I have to learn to do it myself."" The Sisterhood of the Traveling BDUs . Having a parent in the National Guard comes with its own challenges. National Guard members live civilian lives, so their families are often geographically isolated from others like them -- but the children of career military members live near and attend school with other kids whose parents may be sent overseas. High school student Kaylei Deakin of California remembered being teased when she wore her father's jacket to school after he was deployed to Afghanistan in April 2007. Jokingly, students without parents in the military asked her, ""Was your dad shot at?"" Kaylei felt alone, thinking no one could understand her, especially when her mother became depressed shortly after her father left. But Deakin said she kept busy babysitting her sisters, 8 and 3 at the time. ""I was emotional but I tried not to be in front of my sisters,"" Kaylei said. This summer, while their friends were busy deciding what to wear to the pool, Kaylei and Moranda Hern, another 17-year-old California teen with a father deployed to Afghanistan with the National Guard, created the Sisterhood of the Traveling BDUs, short for ""battle dress uniform."" They've planned a 2010 conference that will bring together 400 military girls from across the state to address the issues of being a military child. In organizing the conference, the two assumed responsibilities many college students have yet to experience: filling out tax exemption forms, developing a curriculum for participants, soliciting donations from major companies. ""If you pass by us, we don't really have a normal teenage conversation,"" said Moranda in a high-pitched bubbly voice. She's been working on the project the entire summer. ""We sound like 35-year-old businessmen.""","Children of parents deployed to wars overseas assume adult responsibilities .

"(CNN) -- The Chinese government has lifted a 20-year-old rule that banned foreigners with HIV and AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and leprosy from entering the country, according to the country's state news agency. State-run news agency Xinhua reported Tuesday that China's State Council decided to repeal the ban after realizing it did little to prevent the spread of disease and caused problems when the country was hosting international events. The revision came days before the opening of the six-month Shanghai World Expo, which organizers expect will draw 70 million people. The government had previously lifted the ban temporarily for other large-scale events, including the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Xinhua said the health ministry estimates the number of people living with HIV in China had reached 740,000 by October 2009, with deaths caused by AIDS totaling 49,845 since the first case was reported in 1985. China's decision comes several months after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed HIV infection from the list of diseases that prevent non-U.S. citizens from entering the country. Until January, the U.S. was one of seven countries with laws barring entry of people with HIV, according to amfAR, an AIDS research organization.","China lifts ban on foreigners with HIV, AIDs, sexually transmitted diseases, leprosy .

"(CNN) -- Springwood teenagers Dean, Kris, Jesse, Nancy and Quentin are having trouble not sleeping: They're knocking back coffee, popping pills, anything to delay another date with their dream stalker (which may explain why these high school students look like college grads). When one of them does drop off, the bedsheets turn red. Wes Craven's 1984 slumber party massacre started from scratch -- it was a low-budget item from what was then a genuine independent studio, New Line -- and became the iconic horror franchise of the decade. With his battered fedora, a striped sweater, a razor-glove and a face like Sal's Famous, Freddy Krueger was the most personable boogie man Hollywood had come up with in a long time, so what if he was also a child abuser? A recurring nightmare who stalked teenagers as they slept, Freddy preyed on the defenseless and played fast and loose with physics: If Salvador Dali had created a slasher movie villain, he might have come up with someone like Freddy. After eight movies, a TV series and a comic book, you might think Mr. Krueger had been done to death. It's been seven years since Freddy put Jason Vorhees in his place (in ""Freddy vs Jason""). But you can't keep a good bad guy down, and at the rate Hollywood is cannibalizing its horror back catalogue, we'll be seeing remakes of the remakes any day now. Directed by pop video director Samuel Bayer and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer, the new ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is actually a lot like the old one. So much so, for a while you wonder why they didn't just re-release it. (You'll wish they had.) Surprisingly, Bayer doesn't go the Michael Bay route and give it a high-gloss, ADD tempo, but in duplicating the most memorable bits from the original (the glove in the bath, for instance, and the face coming through the wallpaper), he fails to put his own stamp on it. As Freddy, Jackie Earle Haley, who was Oscar nominated for playing a sex offender in ""Little Children"" (and who went on to play Rorschach in ""Watchmen"" and the battered psychopath Noyce in ""Shutter Island"") finds Robert Englund a tough act to follow. Haley drops his voice an octave and comes on heavy -- this Freddy mostly keeps his quips to himself -- but he's significantly shorter than Englund, and the make-up suggests nothing so much as Ray Bolger in ""The Wizard of Oz"": the scarecrow who didn't even scare the crows. iReporter gives new ""Nightmare"" an ""A"" Branching out tentatively toward something new, the film toys with repressed memory syndrome and the intriguing suggestion that maybe Freddy was innocent; that he has every right to be angry about the lynch mob that incinerated him. I'll leave you to imagine how far the filmmakers go with that radical notion, but maybe a prequel would have been a more rewarding way to go? The new ""Nightmare"" also proudly introduces a clinical-sounding term called ""micro-naps,"" a side effect of sleep deprivation that handily justifies more shock effects even as the number of survivors is whittled down to two (gratifyingly, they're the least synthetic of the young cast members). But is it scary? Barely. In the wake of ""Paranormal Activity,"" Freddy's grandstanding theatrics seem pretty old hat. There is nothing about this redundant remake to give anyone sleepless nights, unless it's threat of yet more of the same old same old. Enough with the ""re-imagining,"" Hollywood; just imagine!","Director Samuel Bayer struggles to put own stamp on Wes Craven's 1984 original .

"Washington (CNN) -- An Iranian navy plane that approached a U.S. aircraft carrier last week was flying as low as 300 feet as it neared the USS Eisenhower, U.S. military officials said Wednesday. The incident, first reported by CNN on Tuesday, came as Iran was beginning a series of military exercises last week meant to show off their military prowess. The Eisenhower was on duty in the Gulf of Oman in the northern Arabian Sea, in support of the Afghanistan war efforts, when the Iranian maritime patrol aircraft flew within 1,000 yards of the vessel, according to military officials. While the encounter was not threatening, it was unusual. U.S. navy ships have regularly encountered Iranian aircraft in the Persian Gulf in recent years, but this encounter took place in the Gulf of Oman, in an area where Iranian jets are seen much less frequently, several Navy officials said. The officials declined to be identified, citing the extremely sensitive nature of any U.S. military interaction with Iranian forces. Adm. Gary Roughead, the top Navy officer, confirmed the April 21 incident. The Iranians were ""not provocative or threatening. As long as they are professional and not threatening or reckless, it's international space,"" he said. Radar on the Eisenhower and other U.S. ships in the vicinity closely tracked the Iranian aircraft as it approached the aircraft carrier to ensure it maintained a nonthreatening path, Roughead said. A senior U.S. military official said the Iranian plane was tracked by U.S. units for nearly 100 miles before it reached the Eisenhower. The Iranian aircraft was a Fokker F27 that was unarmed, officials said. It remained in the vicinity of the Eisenhower for about 20 minutes before leaving the area, according to the senior official. The Eisenhower had just finished a series of carrier aircraft flight operations and a resupply at sea mission. U.S. officials believe the Iranians wanted a close look at the carrier, but they could not say if the Iranians took photos of the ship. One of the officials also said Iran may simply have been trying to demonstrate its aerial capabilities to the United States. U.S. military officials continue to emphasize that recent encounters with Iranian naval forces in the Persian Gulf have been professional and without confrontation or problems. The U.S. Navy takes great care to try to stay out of the way of any Iranian forces in the region, officials said.","U.S. officials believe the Iranians wanted a close look at the carrier .

"Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee plans to unleash a withering attack Wednesday on private contractors working for the company formerly known as Blackwater in Afghanistan, accusing them of flouting regulations and endangering the U.S. mission. Key to beating the Taliban in Afghanistan will be the ability of U.S. forces to win support from the Afghan people, many of whom do not distinguish between U.S. contractors and the U.S. military, Sen. Carl Levin will say, according to an advance text of his remarks. ""If we are going to win that struggle, we need to know that our contractor personnel are adequately screened, supervised and held accountable -- because in the end, the Afghan people will hold us responsible for their actions,"" the Michigan Democrat will say. ""If we don't fix the problems of oversight and make sure contractors like Blackwater play by the rules and live up to their commitments -- we'll be doing a disservice to our troops by making their already difficult and dangerous job even more so."" See agenda of 9:30 a.m. Wednesday hearing . Though more than 100,000 contractors operate for a variety of contractors in Afghanistan, Levin singled out Paravant, a company that had ""no meaningful distinction"" from the company formerly known as Blackwater, which is currently known as Xe Services, he said in the advance text. Shooting at Camp Darulaman . Levin cited a December 9, 2008, shooting at the U.S. military's range at Camp Darulaman during which a Paravant program manager carrying an AK-47 got on the back of a moving car, then shot and wounded a Paravant trainer on his team when the car hit a bump, Levin said. Though the program manager lost his job, the others on his team who allowed his activities did not, he said. Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan, a multinational military formation that trains the Afghan National Army, did not appear to have investigated the incident, he said. Had it done so, the U.S. Army ""would have seen that Paravant personnel were using weapons improperly and unsafely, with inadequate supervision, and that they were carrying weapons that they weren't even supposed to have,"" according to Levin. Two civilians killed . He also cited a widely reported May 5, 2009, incident in which two Paravant personnel fired their weapons, killing two Afghan civilians and wounding a third. The two men have been charged with murder in the shootings. An Army investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had ""violated alcohol consumption policies, were not authorized to possess weapons, violated use-of-force rules and violated movement-control policies,"" said Levin, who cited as his source the man who then led the Combined Security Transition Command -Afghanistan. Paravant's contract required it to ""ensure that its personnel ... behave at all times in accordance with the highest professional and ethical standards,"" Levin said. Records for the two men responsible for the May 5 shooting show the company failed to properly vet them, Levin said. One man's military record ""apparently included assault, insubordinate conduct, absence without leave, failure to obey order or regulation, larceny and wrongful appropriation,"" he said. And his criminal record showed convictions for reckless driving, disturbing the peace, assault and battery, driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest and trespassing. The other man was cited in a news report for having been discharged from the U.S. military after being absent without leave for 22 days and testing positive for cocaine, Levin said. Other Paravant personnel were fired for alcohol use and drug use, he said. Company looks forward to testifying . In a written statement, a spokesman for Xe Services said the company is looking forward to testifying Wednesday. ""Xe's new management was taking steps to address shortcomings in the Paravant program when the tragic May 5 incident occurred,"" said Mark Corallo of Corallo Comstock Communications. ""One of those shortcomings discovered was that the former management of Paravant had provided weapons to personnel for personal protection without first obtaining the proper authorization from DoD. ""Though Raytheon, the prime contractor, and the DoD customer were both aware of Paravant management's decision, and were working to obtain authorization, contractors should not have been armed without the proper approvals. That said, the individual independent contractors' actions the night of May 5 clearly violated clear company policies and they are being held accountable."" After the May 2009 shooting, Raytheon -- which had subcontracted the work to Paravant -- accused the company of having failed to properly oversee its personnel. Paravant responded that it would need more money to do that, Levin said, calling the company's response ""deeply troubling"" since its contractual obligation already called for that. In addition, Paravant called its personnel ""independent contractors,"" despite ""compelling evidence"" that they were company employees, Levin said. That meant that the company withheld no income taxes and paid no Social Security, Medicare or unemployment tax for them, he said. The Internal Revenue Service is considering Paravant's classification. U.S. Army also criticized . Levin also took to task the U.S. Army for ""apparent lack of contractor oversight."" Before last May's shooting, the Army said it had no contracting officer representative in the area, telling the committee that it relied on a Dutch contractor to oversee the project. The Army said it also monitored the contractors from an office in Florida by calling the chief of training and education for the Afghan National Security Forces at Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan. But the chief has told the committee that he did not travel to the training sites to observe Paravant's personnel, Levin said. On December 3, 2008, before the first shooting incident, Raytheon told the Army by e-mail that Paravant workers had weapons without authority, Levin said, but the Army ""apparently failed to take action."" A separate report released earlier this month by the inspectors general of the Department of Defense and the State Department criticizes the State Department for its oversight of Afghan training contracts, specifically a $1 billion contract to train Afghan National Police. The State Department failed to keep track of the money and materials, including weapons, and failed to prepare the police to fight off insurgents, the report said. Additionally, Levin said a key mission of U.S. forces in Afghanistan is to train and equip Afghan security forces to take the lead in the war, adding that they use a U.S.-operated facility near Kabul to store weapons for the Afghan forces. Though no policy exists that allows contractors or subcontractors to use weapons stored at the site, called Bunker 22, Blackwater personnel ""acquired several hundred weapons, including more than 500 AK-47s, from the facility on multiple occasions,"" Levin said. Though the company said last June that it had returned them all, Levin said that was not the case, citing one AK-47 that was not returned until late last month. ""These are weapons that belonged to the Afghan National Police -- not Blackwater,"" he said. ""And it is only on the eve of this hearing that the company is giving the majority of them back to the Afghan government."" Levin concluded the advance text by saying that the contractors need to understand that they have an impact on how the U.S. military is perceived. ""Even one irresponsible act by contractor personnel can hurt the mission and put our troops in harm's way,"" he said. ""If we don't fix the problems of oversight and make sure contractors like Blackwater play by the rules and live up to their commitments -- we'll be doing a disservice to our troops by making their already difficult and dangerous job even more so.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Some of the most powerful leaders in American politics came together Thursday to remember Dorothy Height, a woman who dedicated her life to civil rights and justice for the least powerful members of society. President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder led mourners at a memorial service for Height at a packed National Cathedral. Height, a civil rights pioneer, died last week at the age of 98. She had been chair and president emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women and worked alongside civil rights leaders including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., future U.S. Rep. John Lewis and A. Philip Randolph. She was on the platform when King delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the 1963 March on Washington. Height's life was an ""unambiguous record of righteous work,"" Obama said in the service's eulogy. She ""deserves a place of honor in America's memory."" She was a woman of ""quiet, dogged, dignified persistence."" Height was born in an era when ""Jim Crow ruled the South (and) the Klan was on the rise,"" Obama said. ""Progress came slowly. That progress came from the collective efforts of multiple generations of Americans. ... Men and women like Dr. Height took it upon themselves -- often at great risk -- to change this country for the better."" ""May God bless Dorothy Height and the union that she made more perfect,"" he said. Mourners at the service participated in renditions of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and the gospel song ""We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder."" Referred to as the ""godmother"" of the civil rights movement, Height was at the center of countless heated debates over social justice in a changing country beginning in the early days of President Franklin Roosevelt's administration. Among other awards, Height received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994 from President Clinton and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004. Height led the National Council of Negro Women from 1957 to 1988, when she became the group's chair and president emeritus. She was also a key figure in the YWCA beginning in the 1930s. Height was born in Richmond, Virginia, and grew up in Rankin, Pennsylvania. Her civil rights work began in 1933 when she became a leader of the United Christian Youth Movement of North America. She fought to stop lynchings and worked to desegregate the armed forces. Under Height's leadership, the council worked to help women and low-income families by promoting programs to alleviate hunger and build more affordable housing. The organization also spearheaded voter registration drives and started ""Wednesdays in Mississippi"" in which female interracial groups helped at Freedom Schools, institutions meant to empower African-Americans and address inequalities in how the races were educated. She experienced personal discrimination, writing in her memoir about being rejected from New York's Barnard College because she was black. ""Although I had been accepted, they could not admit me,"" she wrote in ""Open Wide the Freedom Gates."" ""It took me a while to realize that their decision was a racial matter: Barnard had a quota of two Negro students per year, and two others had already taken the spots."" At its 1980 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Height its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.","Memorial service held for civil rights icon Dorothy Height, who died last week at 98 .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Unemployment in Spain has reached 20 percent, meaning 4.6 million people are out of work, the Spanish government announced Friday. The figure, from the first quarter, is up from 19 percent and 4.3 million people in the previous quarter. It represents the second-highest unemployment rate in the European Union, after Latvia, according to figures Friday from Eurostat, the EU's statistics service. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told Parliament on Wednesday he believes the jobless rate has peaked and will now start to decline. The first quarter of the year is traditionally poor for Spain because of a drop in labor-intensive activity like construction, agriculture and tourism. This week, Standard & Poor's downgraded Spain's long-term credit rating and said the outlook is negative. ""We now believe that the Spanish economy's shift away from credit-fuelled economic growth is likely to result in a more protracted period of sluggish activity than we previously assumed,"" Standard & Poor's credit analyst Marko Mrsnik said. Gross domestic product growth in Spain is expected to average 0.7 percent annually through 2016, compared with previous expectations of 1 percent annually, he said. Spain's economic problems are closely tied to the housing bust there, according to The Economist magazine. Many of the newly unemployed worked in construction, it said. The recession revealed how dependent public finances were on housing-related tax revenues, it said. Another problem in Spain is that wages are set centrally and most jobs are protected, making it hard to shift skilled workers from one industry to another, the magazine said. Average unemployment for the 27-member European Union stayed stable in March at 9.6 percent, Eurostat said Friday. That percentage represents 23 million people, it said. The lowest national unemployment rates were in the Netherlands and Austria, which had 4.1 and 4.9 percent respectively, Eurostat said. -- CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","Government says 4.6 million people are out of work in Spain .

"(CNN) -- A body found Monday beside a North Carolina road is that of 5-year-old Shaniya Davis, who was reported missing a week ago, police said Tuesday. The official cause of death was undetermined as of Tuesday afternoon, Fayetteville police said in written statement. An announced afternoon media briefing was rescheduled for Wednesday morning. Earlier Tuesday, police said additional charges are expected in connection with the case and any charges will be made public as soon as they are filed. Shaniya's mother, Antoinette Nicole Davis, has been charged with human trafficking and other offenses. Davis was ""prostituting her child,"" police spokeswoman Teresa Chance said after Davis' arrest over the weekend. Another suspect, Mario Andrette McNeill, has been charged with kidnapping in the case. Shaniya's father, Bradley Lockhart, made a tearful appeal before reporters Tuesday afternoon, asking that ""everybody makes it a point not to ignore, to look past a situation where a person, a child, or anybody might be in danger ... so that we don't have another tragedy like Shaniya."" He said authorities have given him limited information, but he was to meet with them later. ""It's not the result I wanted, it's not the result any father or family would want for their children,"" he said. ""But God has a greater calling for all of us."" Shaniya's mother reported her missing from their Fayetteville home in a mobile home park on November 10. According to police, surveillance video taken that day from a hotel in Sanford shows Shaniya in the company of McNeill. ""The investigation at this point indicates that Shaniya Davis was alive at the time she left the Sanford hotel,"" police said in the statement Tuesday. The road where the body was found is near Sanford, which is about 30 miles northwest of Fayetteville. Shaniya's half-sister, Cheyenne Lockhart, said on HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" Monday that she found it difficult to believe Davis had treated her daughter so poorly. ""She seemed like the sweetest woman. She didn't come from much, but ... she had the sweetest voice, she had the sweetest personality, and especially toward me.

"(CNN) -- An icy asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Saturn is adding credence to theories that Earth's water was delivered from space, according to a report published in the new issue of the science journal Nature. Two teams of scientists found their evidence when looking at 24 Themis, a asteroid about 479 million kilometers (300 million miles) from the sun, or roughly three times the average distance from Earth to the sun. Using the infrared telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii, they were surprised to find not only water on 24 Themis, but organic compounds as well. Asteroids were thought to be devoid of water because they sit too close to the sun, while comets have been the water bearers of the universe because they form farther out in space. ""Astronomers have looked at dozens of asteroids with this technique, but this is the first time we've seen ice on the surface and organics,"" astronomer Andrew Rivkin of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, told Nature.com. The scientific teams from Johns Hopkins and the University of Central Florida that looked at 24 Themis speculate that the ice may be held in a reservoir under the asteroid's surface. They speculate that the water is brought to the surface as small bodies in the asteroid belt hit the surface of 24 Themis. The findings on 24 Themis lend weight to the idea that asteroids and comets are the source of Earth's water and organic material. Geochemists believe that early Earth went through a molten phase that would have removed any organic molecules, meaning any new organic material would have had to come to the planet at a later time, said Humberto Campins at UCF. ""I believe our findings are linked to the origin of life on Earth,"" he added. Scientists now plan to scan the asteroid belt for more evidence of water and organic materials, hoping to determine if 24 Themis is just an interloper -- possibly a comet that got caught in the asteroid belt -- or the first of many water-bearing asteroids that will change the way astronomers look at the solar system. ""The old-fashioned picture of the solar system in which asteroids are asteroids and comets are comets is getting harder to sustain,"" Rivkin said.","Report: Scientists find first evidence of water on asteroid .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to fast food, the big chains can't help going over the top. April brought consumers the Double Down heard around the world -- a bunless bomb o' meat from KFC touting the slogan ""It's real."" Bloggers taste-tested it, The New York Times's restaurant critic reviewed it, it was a top trending topic Twitter alongside the likes of Justin Bieber - and after two weeks, did the company's Double Down wager pay off? The stakes are high indeed, especially after KFC's sales fell 5.8 percent in 2009, according to food industry research firm, Technomic. ""Unfortunately, we are not able to provide sales information,"" KFC's Public Relations Manager, Rick Maynard, told CNN. Those numbers only become available from Yum! Brands, the chain's parent company that also owns Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, during its quarterly reporting. ""It [the Double Down] continues to generate a tremendous amount of online buzz, from videotaped taste tests on YouTube to real-time, in-store reviews via Twitter. If social media is an indication, the Double Down is developing quite a cult following."" Maynard said. But does the adage ""any publicity is good publicity"" hold true? ""Stunt food has been a part of restaurant life probably since the first time a chef put a napkin over a customer's head in order to serve him a whole, rare, roasted ortolan,"" (a legendarily decadent meal of a fatty bird, bones and all) wrote Sam Sifton, The New York Times restaurant critic. If the past is any indicator, the Evil Knievels of the fast food realm have worked. Though their calorie count is a lot more Evil than Knievel. St. Louis-based Hardee's Food Systems Inc. rolled out its now-infamous Monster Thickburger in 2004. The self-proclaimed ""monument to decadence"" features two 1/3 pound Angus beef patties, four bacon strips, three slices of American cheese, and mayonnaise on a buttered sesame seed bun - and clocks in at approximately 1,420 calories and 107 grams of fat. For Hardee's, the sales for the fast food chain have risen steadily since it found its niche in behemoth burgers. The Monster Thickburger produced an 8 percent growth in sales during its first year alone. ""And I have to give KFC credit for doing something to get rid of all that grilled chicken,"" said Jenna Petroff, public relations and social media manager of Hardee's Food Systems. ""Oh, and we've been doing that non-bread-as-a-carrier-thing since 2003 with the Low Carb Thickburger and Low Carb Six Dollar Burger."" Lettuce replaces the bun in these creations. In 2005, Burger King went against the fast food industry trend of offering more healthy choices by introducing the Enormous Omelet Sandwich -- two eggs, two slices of cheese and three slices of bacon and sausage on a large bun. The 760-calorie no-utensils-required meal helped increase Burger King's breakfast sales by 20 percent. The sandwich has since been discontinued in United States stores. Though these successes contain one thing the Double Down is fairly modest in: calorie count. The Double Down weighs in at 540 calories, 32 grams of fat, and 1,380 milligrams of sodium. While that's still well over half the average adult's recommended recommended daily allowance of sodium and nearly half a day's fat intake, it's practically a novelty compared to other chains' dietary assaults. According to Advertising Age, this type of product could muddy KFC's image after the chain heavily promoted the ostensibly healthful release of its grilled chicken in 2009 and most recently, its ""Buckets for the Cure"" affiliation with cancer-fighting charity powerhouse, the Susan G. Komen Foundation. ""The series of stunts drove buzz and the introduction of grilled chicken spiked short-term sales, the moves also contributed to a lack of consistent brand positioning and a distraction from KFC's flagship product -- both of which have hurt the chain,"" said Emily Bryson York. Despite the buzz, the Double Down is still planned for a limited time only release -- through May 23.","KFC launched its a bunless bomb o' meat -- but did Double Down boost sales?

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico City, the country's capital, is one of the world's important cultural centers -- showcasing Latin America's rich history and traditions. ""I love its uniqueness,"" CNN's Armando Talamantes said of the city where he lives and works. ""The weather is never too hot and never too cold."" What's just right is the city's endless supply of music, local food and art museums. With a population of 8.8 million people, Mexico City is one of the most densely populated areas in the country and one of the richest cities in the world. It's also a huge attraction for soccer fans and bullfighting enthusiasts. From eating out any time of the night to enjoying a day in the ""Mexican Venice,"" or Xochimilco, to visiting the pyramids just outside the city, Talamantes says Mexico City is a constant surprise and delight. Here, he offers some insider tips on traveling to his hometown: . Where can you get the best view of the city? If you're downtown, go to the top of Torre Latinoamericana. It was the tallest skyscraper in Mexico City for many years. Now, it's kind of old but keeps its charm. If you're on Reforma, Mexico's most beautiful avenue, try to step into Piso 51 in Torre Mayor, the tallest skyscraper in Latin America. Beware: It is a private club, and you will be asked to join. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Taberna del León in Plaza Loreto offers traditional Mexican cuisine in a cozy environment. It's managed by Mónica Patiño, the famous Mexican chef. Where is the best place to people watch? Try barrio La Condesa -- its streets are full of bars and restaurants attracting a very interesting crowd, especially on nights and weekends. Also, you can go to Emilio Castelar, a street in Polanco full of life and good-looking people. What is your favorite neighborhood? Why? Colonia Roma is becoming the ""Mexican Soho,"" with lots of galleries, restaurants, bars, boutique hotels, fountains and squares. It is antique, so you can find old buildings, but it's also transforming into a more modern area. It is close to La Condesa, which is also a very cool place, full of young people. What's the biggest misconception about your city? You won't believe how many trees are in the city. And the robberies aren't that common, either. Where do you go to relax? Espacio Escultórico at the UNAM, Mexico's biggest university campus, offers a collection of sculptures by famous artists. That is a little farther south of the city. If you're not willing to travel that much, go into Bosque de Chapultepec's audiorama, where you can sit on a bench and listen to some good music. What essential thing should visitors see or experience if they have only a few hours? Go inside Museo de Antropología, which showcases the very DNA of Mexico. If you don't want to step into a museum, go downtown to see El Zocalo (Mexico City's main square) and Templo Mayor, the remains of an ancient Aztec temple. What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? The biggest tourist trap is Plaza Garibaldi, were the mariachis are awful and you can get mugged. A trap that could be worth seeing is the area called Xochimilco, often called ""Mexican Venice"" because of a series of canals. Where was your most memorable meal? Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? Zinco bar, on Cinco de Mayo Street in downtown, has great jazz music and a very cheerful crowd. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Not really. Just stick to the tacos and tequila as if you were any place in Mexico. If you want something fancy, try duck enchiladas in Izote restaurant on Avenue Presidente Masaryk, Mexico's most expensive street. What is a good local souvenir? Rag dolls sold by the local natives in the streets.","Espacio Escultórico at Mexico's biggest university campus has a relaxing collection of sculptures .

"New York (CNN) -- Protesters rallied in downtown New York City Thursday to voice their anger over what they perceive as the roles Wall Street and big banks played in America's economic crisis. Marching from City Hall to Wall Street, the protesters chanted ""good jobs for all,"" and held signs with messages including ""Hold banks accountable,"" ""Make Wall Street Pay,"" and ""Reclaim America."" The AFL-CIO organized the rally, and union President Richard Trumka addressed the crowd, saying, ""How long will we allow the spirit of greed to continue to drive us into economic holes?"" The National People's Action, a group that was involved in organizing the protest, said in a news release that demonstrators represented unemployed workers, foreclosure victims and community activists. Protester Gerard Pettine said he just wants Wall Street to be held accountable for its involvement in the economic collapse. ""They need to have some integrity and some honor and do the right thing,"" Pettine told CNN. Protester Elizabeth Soto, who came with her brother to the rally, was concerned about the lack of job creation. ""We are here to say Wall Street's got to help Main Street,"" she said. ""We supported the stimulus bill, which bailed out Wall Street, but we expected the jobs to come back to Main Street."" The New York Police Department estimated that 6,000 people participated in the rally. Earlier Thursday, as part of a larger ""day of action"" against Wall Street, protesters descended upon the headquarters of two New York City banks -- JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo -- leaving letters for the banks' chief executive officers. The letters, according to the news release from the National People's Action, said that the banks have an opportunity ""to step up to the plate and be leaders in rebuilding the American economy."" JP Morgan spokesperson Mike Fusco declined to comment on the letter, but said that there were a ""couple dozen"" protesters who were in the building for less than a half hour. Fran Durst of Wells Fargo said that about 100 protesters flooded their building's lobby and tried to deliver their letter to the bank's CEO. Durst said the event didn't cause a major disruption to the bank. Other protests were scheduled in San Francisco, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the National People's Action news release. CNN's Mary Snow, Jennifer Rizzo, Cassie Spodak, and Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.","Thousands of protesters hit streets, demand Wall Street accountability .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will deliver the eulogy Thursday at the funeral of civil rights leader Dorothy Height, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. Height's funeral is set for 10 a.m. ET Thursday at Washington National Cathedral. Height died last week at the age of 98. The lasting impact of her life was reflected Tuesday evening by the hundreds of people who came out to pay their respects at her viewing at the National Council of Negro Women, an organization that she served as national president for 41 years. People lined three city blocks in Washington to attend the viewing and praised Height as a leader. ""To me she's a part of history for women's rights and the civil rights movement,"" Delores Levalle said while waiting to enter the building. Many of the people attending the viewing emphasized how inspirational she was as a woman and as a leader of the civil rights movement, a woman who stood beside Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Patricia Green, who worked with Height in the 1970s, said she believes ""this outpouring of affection for her is an understanding of the unique contribution she has made not just to African-American history, but to American history in general.""

"(CNN) -- Amid all the talk about storm clouds gathering over the U.S. economy, it's easy to forget there are other places in the world where the sun is still shining. A shortage of housing is contributing to an inflation rate of almost 14 percent in Qatar . Take Qatar, for example; a small emirate in the Gulf whose economy is booming. When the final figures come in, Qatar's economy is expected to have grown 17.8 percent in 2007. Qatar National Bank predicts growth to slow in 2008, but at 16.5 percent who could complain? Well, consumers for one. While growth has steamed ahead, so has inflation. At the end of 2007, Qatar's official inflation rate was nearing 14 percent -- the highest in the region. Three major factors are contributing to Qatar's soaring inflation rate: High levels of government spending; growing demand for housing, which is pushing up house prices and rent, and the riyal's peg with the dollar, which is pushing down interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve exacerbated the latter problem by slashing U.S. interest rates twice in the past eight days to three percent. Gulf States with currencies linked to the U.S. dollar were under pressure to follow suit. Qatar reduced its deposit rate to 3.5 percent, but left its lending rate at 5.5 percent. Liz Martins, Head of MENA, Business Monitor International says Qatar is facing a serious problem. ""You've huge a amount of monetary easing and if you think that that's not even going to feed through properly for six to nine months then, you've got a really dangerous inflationary outlook,"" she says. ""The only policy option really that they have is to revalue the exchange rate."" Kuwait did just that in May, ditching the dollar-peg for a basket of currencies, and speculation is growing that other GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries will do the same. Tristan Cooper, Vice President and Senior Analyst at Moody's Middle East, says the argument for revaluation is becoming more convincing. ""The economic justification for revaluation is growing stronger as inflation multiplies and the government increases expenditure."" He says any move by Gulf governments to curb public spending would not be welcomed by locals facing higher living costs. In Qatar's instance, new housing stock is expected to come onto the market to help ease inflation in the rental market. ""There is some hope that prices will begin to slow as that supply comes onto the market, but that's not guaranteed,"" Tristan Cooper says. So that leaves a currency revaluation. ""The easier policy option would presumably be to revalue, but that also has political difficulties. It involves to some extent coordinating with GCC members."" In the past, Saudi Arabia has ruled out any change to its dollar-peg. Qatar has made it clear that it prefers any move to be made with a GCC consensus. In an interview with Marketplace Middle East, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani said that the emirate is ""studying all options"" in relation to the dollar-peg. ""Every country has to see its way out of this, but only after a consultation with the GCC,"" he said. ""For us, our wish is that it's a policy to be taken by the whole GCC, to either basket or revalue our currency. I cannot see a decision. Even in Qatar, we have no decision up to now."" This week, one of Qatar's leading economic advisors was quoted as saying any policy change would have to be substantial. In an interview with Reuters news agency, Ibrahim Al-Ibrahim said, ""change should be major; minor change won't solve the problem."" He ruled out any potential moves to float the Qatari riyal. ""As a small country we cannot float our currency... it has to be tied,"" he said. One of the main reasons GCC members are reluctant to abandon their dollar link is because they're working towards their own monetary union. A policy diversion now may make it more difficult to unite again under a common currency by the nominated deadline of 2010. There's widespread skepticism that that deadline can be reached. ""The timeframe of 2010 is rather unlikely now, and the project itself seems to be facing increasing difficulties given the pressure on individual states to go their own way and revalue,"" Tristan Cooper says.

"(CNN) -- Early each morning, millions of farmers around the world rise to toil in their fields. By night, gangs of mobsters scheme and legions of poker players shuffle up and deal. Sure, none of it's real. But the overwhelming popularity of so-called social gaming -- simple games that let people play with their friends on networking sites such as Facebook -- is changing the face of video games, experts say. And as the maker of popular titles like FarmVille and Mafia Wars, San Francisco, California-based Zynga has ridden the games' skyrocketing popularity to the top of that emerging market. For Zynga founder Mark Pincus, the formula for gaming success on Facebook, MySpace and other sites was as simple as it might seem counterintuitive: create simple games that people like but can easily set aside. ""We built the games so they could be played in a tab on your browser while you're on a conference call,"" said Pincus, a veteran Web entrepreneur who created Zynga in 2007. Of course, they've been helped by the massive growth of Facebook, where the games are so popular they've spawned ""fan"" pages devoted to complaining about having to watch friends play them. Facebook, with its 400 million users, is where the vast majority of people play FarmVille and Mafia Wars along with other Zynga titles like FishVille, Vampires, Café World, YoVille and Zynga Poker. In all, more than 65 million people play Zynga games every day, according to media tracking company Developer Analytics. Zynga's top title, FarmVille, is played by an estimated 75 million people each month --  roughly equal to the number who have played the classic arcade and desktop game Tetris during its entire existence. The massive growth was satisfying but not altogether surprising to Pincus, whose previous startups had included Freeloader, a Web-based information-gathering service; tech-support company SupportSoft; and Tribe.net, an early social networking site from 2003. He said that starting the game company, which he named after his late English bulldog, was an effort to fill what he considered a surprising void in most people's daily Internet use. ""I thought in 2007 that something had gone oddly wrong with the whole Internet experience,"" Pincus said. ""I would have thought games would have been one of the top two or three experiences people had on the Internet."" What Pincus got right, according to gaming expert Scott Steinberg, was a sort of return to the ""golden era"" of games like Pac-man and Super Mario Bros. ""Video games actually appealed to a huge cross-section. They appealed to everybody,"" said Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com. ""What happened is, as we went through the mid-'80s to the mid-2000s, you started to see gaming become more incestuous in terms of 18- to 34-year-old males making games for people just like them."" By contrast, three of Zynga's top five games -- FarmVille, Café World and FishVille -- have mostly female players, with many players outside the traditional 18- to 34-year-old range. Those games all operate on the same basic premise. Starting with a simple farm, fish tank or restaurant, the player works to make it bigger and fancier, sharing items with friends and helping each other along the way. Some of Zynga's early titles simply mirrored existing board and card games. It was Mafia Wars -- in which players team up to whack other gangs -- that first exhibited what would become the hallmarks of social gaming: simple, single-player action that's enhanced by teamwork. With FarmVille, that formula would become complete. Players plant virtual crops that can be harvested hours, or days, later. Along the way, they invite online friends to become their neighbors and help each other by sending gifts or helping with the farming. There's no way to ""win,"" but players take satisfaction in building big, fancy farms that they can showcase to their friends. ""A farm is something that is internationally understood and known. It's cross-cultural, cross-gender, cross-age,"" Pincus said. ""A great social game should be like a great cocktail party. If you want it to appeal to absolutely everyone you invite, it has to be broad in its content so that everyone gets it."" Not that Zynga's success has come without criticism. With hundreds of smaller companies vying for a piece of the social gaming market, some rivals have accused Zynga of using its hefty venture capital to crowd out less-financed competitors. Many of its most popular games, including FarmVille, are similar to pre-existing games from smaller companies, a fact Pincus dismisses by noting that video games have always fallen into genres with similar titles from competing companies. Psycho Monkey LLC, the makers of Mob Wars, filed a lawsuit claiming that Mafia Wars ripped them off. Zynga settled that case in August, said a spokeswoman for the company. Zynga also was hit with complaints and lawsuits over its original business model, which let players earn in-game rewards for things like signing up for a credit card or video-rental membership. Critics said some of the offers amounted to scams, leading players to download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for memberships that appeared stealthily on their phone bills. Pincus has acknowledged not being vigilant enough with the automated ads that appeared on Zynga games during the company's early days. ""We were playing whack-a-mole,"" Pincus said. ""Every time we found one of these or got a complaint, we would take them down. Eventually ... we realized we had to take a much more aggressive stance than a normal Web site."" In November, Zynga removed all ""lead-generating"" ads, relying for revenue instead on the roughly 1 to 3 percent of the player base that pays for in-game items, such as a barn in FarmVille. It has since been putting the advertisements back in, with a new system that lets it more closely monitor what kind of ads show up, Pincus said. ""We'll see where this goes for the entire industry,"" Pincus said. ""It was really important to us to maintain a trusted position with our users. We wanted to do the right thing, and I think we did."" Pincus offers a ray of hope for another vocal group of critics: the social-media users who say they're tired of seeing all of their friends' updates about Zynga and other social games. On Facebook, a group called ""I dont care about your farm, or your fish, or your park, or your mafia!!!"" had more than 5.2 million members recently. ""Please. No more of this stuff,"" wrote one member. ""I've had all I can take. About to hang up FACEBOOK. Just want a nice cozy place to talk with my friends!"" Pincus said he hopes that messages from games can eventually be targeted to a more select audience. ""We have to evolve,"" Pincus said ""I think it's heading to a place that's more narrow-casting. I think you'll get to a place where Facebook will be better about showing feeds to people who have a registered interest in them."" For example, he said, there might eventually be a way to send game notifications only to people who play social games themselves. ""It's not just games. It's going to be true for music, for pictures, for status updates,"" Pincus said. ""I think, over time, these networks are going to start to shape more to ... your [registered interests]."" Meanwhile, Zynga will be among the developers continuing to change how people look at video gaming. It's a change that Steinberg, the gaming guru, says will be for the better. While heavyweights like Electronic Arts and the popular Civilization series are making inroads into social gaming, Steinberg said, the genre is also opening up opportunities for smaller developers. ""We're seeing, in many ways, a second renaissance for games,"" Steinberg said. ""There's been an epiphany among the developer community saying, 'Look at these millions of users that we've forgotten to speak to for years.' This can only be a good thing for the gaming industry in the end.""","Zynga games like FarmVille, Mafia Wars are played by millions every day on Facebook .

There was no tsunami damage ""though there may be slight sea level changes from now on,"" it said, referring to the areas affected by the advisory -- the Okinawa Islands, the Amami Islands and the Tokara Islands. The quake was centered 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep and struck at 5:31 a.m. (3:31 p.m. ET Friday) about 85 kilometers (53 miles) from Okinawa. The quake was felt on Okinawa, with shaking that lasted about 15 seconds, said Lt. Col. Daniel King of the U.S. Pacific Command. He told CNN that commanders in Japan and Hawaii were trying to get damage and casualty reports from U.S. military stations on Okinawa, but had heard nothing in the immediate aftermath. About 20,000 U.S. troops -- mostly Marines, along with Navy and Air Force personnel -- are stationed on eight bases on Okinawa, he said. Are you there?

"The Hague, Netherlands (CNN) -- Prosecutors in the long-awaited war crimes trial of Radovan Karadzic said they will push ahead Tuesday, though the Bosnian Serb leader is expected to be a no-show once again. On Monday -- the opening day of the trial -- the court was forced to adjourn after Karadzic refused to appear, saying he did not have enough time to prepare. Karadzic, who is accused of masterminding the worst massacre in Europe since World War II, is representing himself. ""Obviously, it is the court's preference for Karadzic to attend,"" said Nerma Jelacic, spokeswoman for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. ""But if he chooses not to attend, then some facility will be provided to him to allow him to watch the court's proceedings from his prison cell."" The court cannot force a defendant to appear. Karadzic, as a ""self-representing accused,"" is the only one who can cross-examine witnesses and speak in court about the substance of the charges against him. However, judges can impose a lawyer on Karadzic if he continues to refuse to cooperate. Karadzic faces 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats and other non-Serbian civilians during the brutal and bloody dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Bosnia and Herzegovina were a part of Yugoslavia at the time. The conflict introduced the phrase ""ethnic cleansing"" into the lexicon describing war crimes, as different factions in multi-ethnic Yugoslavia sought to kill or drive out other groups. Karadzic was arrested last year after more than a decade on the run and was found to have been living in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, and practicing alternative medicine in disguise. In a letter dated Wednesday and made public Thursday, Karadzic complained to the International Criminal Tribunal that he had not received the relevant case material on time. He also said there was too much material to go through, even had he received it promptly. ""I ask Your Excellencies -- why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to literally bury me under a million of pages, only to start disclosing relevant material many months after my arrest?"" he wrote. ""Why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to file its final indictment against me on the eve of the planned trial date?"" He promised to continue his preparations in ""the most intensive way"" and inform the court when he is ready. The genocide charges against Karadzic stem partly from killings in Srebrenica, the most notorious massacre of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Memories of the massacre remain raw. Watch the video . Prosecutors at the U.N. war crimes tribunal accuse Karadzic of responsibility. ""On 8 March 1995, Karadzic instructed Bosnian Serb forces under his command to create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival for the inhabitants of Srebrenica, amongst other places,"" the tribunal said in a statement this month. The Hague indictment also said Karadzic committed genocide when forces under his command killed non-Serbs during and after attacks in more than a dozen Bosnian municipalities early in the war. Karadzic, who faces life in prison if he is convicted, denies the charges. The court cannot impose the death penalty. The 1992-95 Bosnian war was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations. Karadzic was removed from power in 1995, when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office. Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague.","Court spokeswoman: Radovan Karadzic can watch trial from cell .

While more college students opt to do volunteer work on their breaks (and you can certainly find a family volunteer project, too) families have discovered that it is easier -- and often cheaper -- to get away in the spring than in the summer when camps and summer jobs -- not to mention work schedules and peak travel season perils -- wreak havoc with family vacation planning. That's why despite the recession you can expect to see parents and kids racing down ski slopes all around the country. In Vermont, try a smaller, less expensive area like Bolton Valley. California's Northstar-at-Tahoe offers deep family discounts. Kids can ski two days here for $30 and you get half-off a second kids' ski lessons. Or choose instead to cheer on your favorite teams at spring training games in Florida and Arizona. Look for deals like at the InterContinental Tampa, which is close to George Steinbrenner's Legends Field. Here you'll save 25 percent on the best rate and get a ""Fan Tool Kit,"" which includes a baseball for signing, a box of Cracker Jack and a lot more. (The kids will love this!) In Arizona, the historic Wigwam Golf Resort & Spa offers an overnight spring training escape package starting at just $219, plus resort credits, while the W Scottsdale Hotel & Residences, a hip downtown property, promises the chance to mingle with the players at practice, suite accommodations, signed baseball gear and buy-one-get-one tickets -- as long as you can afford $1,000 per night. Throughout March and April, look for deals in Hawaii like those at Maui's Honua Kai Resort & Spa. Honua offers up to 35 percent off the room rate, which starts at just $260/night for a one-bedroom suite. Or try the Caribbean (look for kids up to 15 free deals available now at Club Med as long as you book by March 1.) If sailing is more your style, share dinner with grandparents on mega cruise ships while happily comparing notes at what a great deal you scored. ""In past years, many of these ships and categories would be sold out by now,"" according to Heidi Allison-Shane from Cruise Compete.com. She notes that while prices are up from last year, they still remain 10 percent lower than 2008 with especially good deals on the ultra deluxe liners. ""There is great availability right now as consumers are waiting until the last minute to book,"" she adds. You certainly don't have to bust the budget either. Take a short cruise, for example, from a port near your home (Norwegian Cruise Line is launching Nickelodeon-themed cruises from New York City in late April) or head to a ski resort touting free nights and lift tickets (The Canyons, for example, in Utah gives two lift tickets for every room booked). Take the train (kids travel at a deep discount on Amtrak) and explore a nearby city. Go with one child if the others have to stay home. Go solo if your significant other can't get away. Use the opportunity to try something new. Learn to scuba dive or snowboard, explore a museum devoted to sport like the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, where basketball was first invented, or music (the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio,) or spies (the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C.). So many families come to Orlando for spring break -- 2.6 million visitors in March and April -- that you'll see more kids here than at any other time of year, except summer. And it won't be nearly as hot. (Check out the new Super Deal program and new Magicard offers on everything from Disney World attractions to accommodations and restaurants). Buy three nights and get two more free, including a week's unlimited admission to Universal Studios' two parks where the much anticipated ""Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" will open later this spring -- less than $800 for two adults and two parents. You may even score free admission to see The Mouse himself at Walt Disney World, if your family spends a day volunteering. Look for hotel packages in Orlando and elsewhere, especially for families. In honor of Holiday Inn Club Vacations in Orlando, Florida's, first anniversary, for example, guests can score an upgrade to a two-bedroom villa, a $250 resort credit, lazy river tubes, mini golf and more. Or you can avoid hotels entirely. One friend checks www.craigslist.com for apartment rentals in cities where she wants to visit and proposes what she'd like to pay, typically scoring a deal -- at half the going rate, she boasted. Also try sites like www.vrbo.com and www.homeaway.com where you can also negotiate directly with a homeowner or check out www.perfectfamilyvacation.com for good deals on digs in resort locales with multi-bedrooms. Travelocity has more than 100 hotels for under $100 per night. Hotels are where the values are this spring with rates down 10 percent or more in destinations like Orlando, Cancun, Honolulu, South Florida and Tampa/St. Petersburg, reports Travelocity's Genevieve Brown. Last spring break -- my daughter Mel's last before she went away to college -- I let her lead the way straight to Austria's Oetztal Valley, about an hour from Innsbruck. We holed up in the Hotel Regina, a small, quaint hotel, and skied every day, traversing glaciers, viewing the Alps and stopping at traditional wooden huts for hearty lunches of homemade sausage and apple strudel. Mel, an avid skier, was thrilled by the mountains and by the fact that she could drink legally. I was thrilled to have her all to myself for a few days. ""Good bonding time,"" she told me. Exactly what a spring break should be -- wherever you go.","Families have discovered it's often easier and cheaper to vacation in the spring .

"(CNN) -- Four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said Thursday they will challenge Arizona's new immigration law, which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Arizona and the National Immigration Law Center held a news conference Thursday in Phoenix to announce the legal challenge. ""The Arizona community can be assured that a vigorous and sophisticated legal challenge will be mounted, in advance of SB1070's implementation, seeking to prevent this unconstitutional and discriminatory law from ever taking effect,"" said Thomas A. Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, known as MALDEF. ""This law will only make the rampant racial profiling of Latinos that is already going on in Arizona much worse,"" said Alessandra Soler Meetze, executive director of the ACLU of Arizona. ""If this law were implemented, citizens would effectively have to carry 'their papers' at all times to avoid arrest. It is a low point in modern America when a state law requires police to demand documents from people on the street."" Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the law last week. It goes into effect 90 days after the close of the legislative session, which has not been determined. Brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts. ""Racial profiling is illegal,"" Brewer said after signing the bill Friday. ""It is illegal in America, and it's certainly illegal in Arizona."" The National Coalition Of Latino Clergy & Christian Leaders said Sunday it also planned legal action. ""Our churches and pastors in Arizona are outraged about the significant threat this anti-immigrant law will have in the lives of Arizona's Latinos,"" said the Rev. Miguel Rivera, the group's chairman. ""This policy violates the rights of American citizens, particularly the fast-growing Latino population of Arizona, by eliminating the basic right of due process, which we are certain that the courts will agree,"" Rivera said. The law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. The measure makes it a state crime to live or travel through Arizona illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. In addition to signing the law, Brewer also issued an executive order that requires training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination. ""This training will include what does and does not constitute reasonable suspicion that a person is not legally present in the United States,"" she said. Some officials in Arizona have expressed their displeasure with the measure. Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon said Thursday that he is ""very disappointed."" He said he is concerned that calls to boycott Arizona businesses and tourism will harm the state. ""I'm very incredulous that our state leaders -- our so-called leaders -- have allowed our state to be split when we're suffering economic hardships,"" Gordon told CNN. Other critics say the bill is unconstitutional and will trample residents' civil rights. ""Quite simply, this law is a civil rights disaster and an insult to American values,"" said Mary Bauer, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""No one in our country should be required to produce their 'papers' or demand to prove their innocence. What kind of country are we becoming?"" But a national Republican leader said Thursday that Arizona is just filling a void left by the federal government. ""I think the people of Arizona have a right to pass their laws under the 10th Amendment,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner said. ""I think it is clearly a result of the federal government's failure to secure our border and to enforce our laws."" Gordon said the real solution is comprehensive immigration reform that would allow more immigrants to legally enter the United States. ""This law doesn't accomplish that,"" he said. ""It doesn't do anything on that."" President Obama has called on Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law this year. CNN has learned that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democratic senators will unveil the outlines of that legislation late Thursday. But Boehner said at a briefing Thursday that ""there's not a chance"" that Congress will approve the measure this year, especially after the recent passage of a health care reform bill. ""I've been out here for a little while and know that in the middle of an election year, after we've had bills like health care shoved down our throats and the process twisted, tortured, pressured, bribed, you cannot do a serious piece of legislation of this size, with this difficulty, in this environment,"" he said. ""And it's nothing more than a cynical ploy to try and engage voters, some segment of voters, to show up in this November's elections."" The Arizona measure has drawn sharp criticism from the Mexican government, which issued an advisory to its citizens this week. The secretary general of the Organization of American States and some member states also expressed concerns about the law Wednesday. ""This is an issue of concern to all citizens of the Americas, beginning with the citizens of the United States, a country with a very rich tradition of immigration and respect for immigrants who have come to lead a better life,"" OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza said. ""The rich tradition we all admire, of recognizing immigrants in the United States, has been harmed, undermined."" The uproar caused by the law has even spread to the nation's pastime. Protesters plan to demonstrate against the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team Thursday outside Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. In Arizona, two popular singers also will voice their opposition. Grammy Award-winning Colombian singer Shakira is scheduled to meet with Gordon on Thursday evening. Singer-songwriter Linda Ronstadt, an Arizona native of Mexican and German descent, also attended the Thursday afternoon rally with the immigrant rights groups. ""What Gov. Brewer signed into law last week is a piece of legislation that threatens the very heart of this great state,"" Ronstadt said. ""We must come together and stop SB1070 from pitting neighbor against neighbor to the detriment of us all."" Federal officials estimate there are about 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the United States, of which about 6.6 million come from Mexico and 760,000 from the rest of Latin America. About 1 million come from Asia. Arizona, which is on the Mexican border, has about 460,000 undocumented immigrants, the federal government says. At least five other states, including California, with 2.6 million, have more undocumented immigrants, the government says. The other states with more illegal immigrants than Arizona are Texas, Florida, New York and Georgia. A Pew Research Center survey late last year found that Americans believe Latinos are discriminated against more than any other major racial or ethnic group in American society. The Pew survey also indicated that about one-third of the nation's Latinos say they or someone they know has experienced discrimination. About 9 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status in the year before the survey. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said they worried that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported.","NEW: 4 groups announce legal challenge in Phoenix .

"(CNN) -- A major winter storm walloped the Northeast on Friday, a day after heavy snow closed schools and roads and caused dangerous conditions. The storm knocked out power to nearly 240,000 homes and businesses in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, slowed traffic and could prompt authorities to cancel up to 1,000 flights at airports serving New York and New Jersey. The storm also frustrated people such as Lulis Leal, a medical office manager who was working from her home in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. She was planning to help her son move into an apartment when she peered out the window Friday morning to see her car covered in snow. ""I can't even move it out of my driveway,"" she said. ""The snow is up over my knee."" She ventured out amid the snow Thursday, saw several wrecks and added a half-hour to her trip by avoiding a snow-covered hill. ""It's very pretty to look at, but it's like, come on, enough already,"" she said. ""I'm very much looking forward to spring."" The rough weather prompted officials to suspend bus service in northern New Jersey. About 225,000 homes and businesses were without power Friday in New York, said Jim Denn of the New York State Public Service Commission. The storm left 10,638 homes and businesses without power in New Jersey and knocked out electrical services to about 3,000 homes and businesses in Pennsylvania, officials in those states said. A snow-covered tree limb fell Thursday in New York's Central Park and killed a 46-year-old man. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation warned residents to stay out of city parks after the death. Forecasters said parts of New York state could get up to a foot of snow, and public schools were closed Friday in New York City. ""The heavy, wet snow will be sufficient to bring down trees and power lines and could also cause roof collapses,"" the National Weather Service said. The storm is the third to hit the region this month. Early Friday, American Airlines had canceled 42 flights out of New York, a spokeswoman said. Delta Air Lines canceled 300 flights from airports in New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. U.S. Airways had canceled 80 flights from airports in and around New York, a spokesman said. Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said authorities expect roughly 1,000 flights to be canceled from the three major airports serving New York and parts of New Jersey. More cancellations were expected for other airlines Friday, according to airport officials. The storm prompted the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights at New York-area airports Thursday, said Port Authority spokesman John Kelly. Buried in snow? Send pictures, video . Parts of New York had received from 22 to 30 inches of snow by Thursday evening, the weather service said. Massachusetts was averaging 22 inches across the state. Parts of Pennsylvania had as much as 12 inches. Areas in Vermont received as much as 38 inches of snow. For some, any more snow was just too much. ""I've just been shoveling,"" a weary man told CNN affiliate WBRE-TV in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. ""And it looks like I'll be doing some more shoveling.""

Although Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani refuted the quotes from Berlusconi on Italian television, a denial from the prime minister has not yet been forthcoming. At a news conference on Friday Leonardo told reporters: ""I don't know what Berlusconi said but, aside from this, I can't deny that our relationship is difficult.

But the relationship will go forward. ""I have never spoken about the future because I have never considered it to be the moment for obvious reasons, and I don't consider it to be today either."" Leonardo has been linked with a return to South America but he insisted he has received no offers to return to Brazil.

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- An Egyptian real estate mogul and a former police officer pleaded not guilty Saturday to the murder of a rising Lebanese pop singer who was found slain in her United Arab Emirates apartment. Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim was found slain in her apartment in Dubai in July. Prosecutors allege that Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a Parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party, paid Muhsen el Sukkari $2 million to kill Suzanne Tamim. Both have denied the charges. Tamim, 30, was found in her Dubai apartment in July with her throat slit. Moustafa's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer, but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it not unusual for men -- such as Moustafa, a married father of three -- to take on additional wives. The prosecutors say the murder was a ""means of taking revenge"" but have not elaborated.  Watch report on murder trial » . ""It did not happen and I have presented all the evidence that I am not guilty,"" Moustafa said in the courtroom Saturday, according to Reuters. ""It did not happen,"" Sukkari said, according to Reuters. ""By Almighty God, my blood is innocent of her."" Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates, the Egyptian judiciary is trying the case in Cairo because Egyptian law does not allow its citizens to be extradited for trials in other countries. The defendants appeared Saturday in cages -- as is typical in Egypt -- before three judges in a crowded downtown courtroom. Heavy security surrounded the building, amid a crush of reporters and onlookers. The case, with its high-profile victim and defendant, has captivated Egypt and the region. After his arrest in September, Egyptian authorities indicted Moustafa, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company. The case will resume on November 15.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A series of bomb attacks disrupted voting as the polls opened in Iraq's national elections Thursday, leaving a total of 12 people dead and another 47 wounded. There had been warnings of insurgent attacks around the vote, which is intended to install a 325-member parliament and select Iraq's next government. Early voting began Thursday for those who will be unable to cast their ballots in Sunday's election, including thousands of army and security personnel. In the first of three attacks, five civilians were killed and 22 injured when a bomb went off in the Hurriya neighborhood of northern Baghdad, an interior ministry official said. The bomb had been placed about 500 meters (546 yards) away from a polling center that was going to be used Sunday, but was not open for Thursday's early voting, the official said. It was not clear whether the polling center was the target, as hundreds of them will be open Sunday, most within 500 meters of each other. Are you voting in Iraq? Send us your story, images . In the al-Mansour district of western Baghdad, at least three people were killed and 25 wounded in a suicide bombing outside a polling center, an interior ministry official said. Most of the casualties were Iraqi army soldiers, the official said. The suicide bomber struck the forces as they were assembling outside the polling center to vote, the official said. The bomber was disguised as an Iraqi police officer and stopped before reaching the polling center, according to a U.S. military statement. A second suicide attacker struck another Iraqi army gathering on its way to vote in the Bab Al-Muadham area of central Baghdad, the ministry said. Four soldiers were killed and 10 others wounded in the attack. Thousands of army and security personnel are among those taking part in Thursday's voting, which is for those who will unable to cast their ballots Sunday. Others voting Thursday include detainees, hospital staff and patients. As many as 700,000 security forces are expected to vote, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission to Iraq. There was heavy security around polling centers Thursday, with Iraqi forces blocking streets around them and not allowing any vehicles in. At one polling center, voters and personnel entering on foot had to go through a number of body searches. Iraqi Air Force helicopters have been active in the skies all day and snipers can be seen on rooftops near polling centers. A public holiday began Thursday and will run until Monday because of the elections. U.S. and Iraqi officials had warned of expected violence ahead of the vote. On Wednesday, three suicide attacks in Baquba, northeast of the capital, killed at least 33 people and wounded dozens more. It is Iraq's fifth nationwide vote since 2003, but only the second for a full four-year-term parliament with its 325 seats. ""The conduct and outcome of the election will be the most decisive moment for Iraqis' future since 2003,"" Ad Melkert, the head of the U.N. mission in Iraq, said Monday. Authorities on Iraqi state television announced special measures for the days surrounding the vote. Since Monday, there has been a ban on motorcycles and bicycles in Baghdad until further notice, and a two-day ban on any vehicles in cities begins Sunday, they said. Provincial borders will be sealed, preventing movements between provinces, from Saturday to Monday. And international borders and all airports will be shut from midnight Saturday. A curfew will be in place in cities from midnight to 5 a.m. on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, officials said. Civilians may not carry weapons on those days, they said.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's punch lines targeted a diverse group Saturday -- from teen sensations the Jonas Brothers to comedian Jay Leno, whom he described as the only person with worse ratings than his. ""Jonas Brothers are here tonight,"" the president said at the annual White House Correspondents' dinner. Daughters ""Sasha and Malia are huge fans. But boys, don't get any ideas. Two words: predator drones."" Obama said he was happy to address the crowd before Leno, who headlined the annual event. ""Glad to see the only person whose ratings fell more than mine last year. ... I'm also glad that I'm speaking first,"" he said. ""We've seen what happens when someone takes the time slot after Leno,"" the president added, referring to comedian Conan O'Brien leaving NBC after an unsuccessful stint hosting ""The Tonight Show."" Members of the Obama administration, including Vice President Joe Biden and chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, were not safe from the zingers either. Former rivals and volatile current issues were also part of the stand-up. The president noted that Arizona Sen. John McCain did not identify himself as a maverick this year -- a title he frequently touted when he was running for presidency against Obama. ""And we all know what happens in Arizona when you don't have an ID. ... Adios amigos,"" Obama said. The president's quip referred to a new immigration law requiring officers in the state to question people about their immigration status if they think they're in the country illegally. Arizona is McCain's home state. Leno also took a dig at the Arizona law. ""I got stuck behind the Arizona congressional delegation -- luckily all their papers were in order so I didn't have any trouble getting in,"" the comedian said while describing the event's tight security. On the president, Leno said he's not as antisocial as some critics accuse him of being. ""He loves to socialize ... health care, car companies, things of that nature,"" Leno said. The first White House Correspondents' Association dinner was held in 1920 to boost communication between the press and the president, according to the association's website. It was open only to men until 1962, when President John F. Kennedy said he would not attend unless women were invited.

"(CNN) -- Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, will be formally admonished Friday by the House's ethics committee for violating rules on receiving gifts, the committee announced Thursday. The issue centers on who paid for his and several other members of the Congressional Black Caucus' 2007 and 2008 travel to the Caribbean. While the committee found that the other five caucus members committed no wrongdoing, Rangel ""violated the House gift rules by accepting payment for reimbursement for travel to the 2007 and 2008 conferences,"" it said in a written statement. Rangel's staff knew corporations had given money to the Carib News, which sponsored the events, the statement said. That fact had not been divulged to the ethics committee when Rangel asked for and received approval to accept the trip, the statement said. The ethics committee also found that Rangel did not know of the contributions. Nonetheless, he would be held responsible. ""The committee does not find sufficient evidence to conclude, nor does it believe that it would discover additional evidence to alter its conclusion, that Representative Rangel had actual knowledge of the memoranda written by his staff. However, the report finds that Representative Rangel was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties."" The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- the lead body for writing tax law in the House -- will have to repay the costs of the trips, according to the statement, which did not indicate how much that would be. ""I don't want to be critical of the committee but common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing or mistakes or errors of staff unless there's reason to believe that the member knew or should have known,"" Rangel told reporters late Thursday night. ""And there's nothing in the record to indicate the latter."" Rangel told reporters he would meet with his lawyer to discuss the report -- which calls itself a service of ""public admonishment"" -- and how it is that he is being held responsible for his staff's actions. He will refund the costs as directed by the ethics committee, Rangel spokesmen Elbert Garcia and Emile Milne said in a written statement. Two staff members knew of the corporate funding and one was ""discharged,"" Rangel said. He did not provide further details. Asked about the matter, House Minority Leader John Boehner said he didn't know all the facts. But, when reminded that he had previously called for Rangel to step aside, he said: ""He should step aside until all this stuff in the ethics committee is resolved."" An aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, ""It's to soon to say anything"" regarding whether Rangel will stay chairman of the committee. ""We have received nothing from ethics,"" said Brendan Daly. A nonprofit ethics group voiced its opinion on the statement Thursday, saying Rangel shouldn't be the only person admonished. ""The ethics committee's decision makes no sense,"" Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington's Executive Director Melanie Sloan said in a written statement. ""There is simply no reason for Rep. Rangel alone to be held accountable for taking this trip when a number of other members were also present."" The ethics committee first announced its investigation into the Caribbean travel in June. The five other Congressional members investigated -- Reps. Bennie Thompson, Yvette Clarke, Donald Payne, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick and Donna Christensen -- did not ""knowingly violate"" rules because they were provided false information, the statement said. They will still have to repay the costs of their trips. For Rangel, the Carib News affair follows a string of entanglements with the ethics committee over several issues, including failure to report assets and pay taxes. CNN's Brianna Keilar contributed to this story.","Rep. Charles Rangel will be formally admonished Friday by House, Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of protesters in cities across the United States waved American flags as they rallied Saturday against Arizona's tough new immigration law and pushed for national immigration reform. ""Si se puede,"" ""Yes we can"" and ""Boycott Arizona"" were common refrains for groups protesting from Los Angeles, California, to New York City. May 1 is traditionally a rallying day for supporters of immigration reform. But protesters across the country said they were galvanized by Arizona's recent passage of a law cracking down on illegal immigration. The new Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they are in the United States illegally. Critics say it will lead to discrimination and racial profiling. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has said the law is necessary because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to move into the state. She said changes to the law she approved Friday, which clarify that police could only stop suspected illegal immigrants while enforcing some other law or ordinance, should eliminate concerns about racial profiling. But criticism of the law was clear among tens of thousands of protesters flooding the streets of Los Angeles on Saturday, where organizers said they hoped to send a strong message with the number of people turning out. ""Does my face look illegal?"" one sign read. Karen Rayner, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said 50,000 people marched at the demonstration's peak. Rayner said the rally was ""very peaceful"" and no one was arrested. Police arrested about 20 protesters -- including a U.S. congressman -- at Saturday's rally in Washington. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, was among a group of protesters who were arrested for blocking the sidewalk outside the White House in what they said was a planned act of civil disobedience. The protesters wore T-shirts that read ""ARREST ME NOT MY FAMILY"" and ""ARREST ME NOT MY FRIENDS."" A smaller group of about 200 people rallied outside the State Capitol in Phoenix, protesting the new law and asking the federal government to step in to stop it. About 1,000 people gathered in New York City's Union Square on Saturday afternoon. Cesar Mack, an international studies student at City College of New York, told CNN he was an undocumented immigrant from Peru. ""I've been living in this country six years and I'm still fighting for immigration reform,"" he said. CNN iReporter Julio Ortiz-Teissonniere said he saw signs in Arabic, French, Spanish and English at the New York rally. One sign in the crowd particularly caught his eye: ""Todos somos Arizona"" -- ""We are all Arizona."" ""They were trying to convey that message that it's a city and nation based on immigration. Everybody came from somewhere else,"" he said. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ted Rowlands, Ione Molinares and Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Rallies unfold in cities across the U.S. against Arizona's new immigration .

"(CNN) -- When animal rights activist Jasmin Singer found herself face to face with a scientist who conducts animal testing, a cupcake was exchanged instead of harsh words. ""A good vegan cupcake has the power to transform everything for the better,"" Singer said. ""It's almost like a political statement with icing."" Singer was co-hosting a vegan bake sale in New York last week as part of the second annual Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale. More than 120 groups across six continents are holding vegan bake sales from April 24 through May 2. Bake sale participants see the sweet treats as a way to introduce those unfamiliar with a vegan diet to some of the flavorful foods they can eat. While vegetarians stay away from meat but may consume dairy and eggs, vegans give up all animal products. Some people become vegan for animal welfare reasons. Others view it as a way to reduce their carbon footprint. Still others choose the plant-based diet as part of a healthier lifestyle. Ruxandra Costescu, of Bucharest, Romania, said most attendees at the bake sales she helped organize weren't vegan. One person who showed up couldn't decide what he wanted, so he took one of everything, she said, adding that he came back later to buy more of his favorites for his family. ""It's really nice to have people who eat anything really appreciate the vegan treats,"" Costescu said. ""Usually people are amazed that they're so tasty."" In Sydney, Australia, Amanda Salles was inspired to start regularly holding vegan bake sales after joining the first worldwide bake sale last year. She has never gone to an animal rights rally, but she tries to make a difference by baking vegan desserts like gingerbread cookies. ""I know a lot of people probably think it's not enough or that you should be going to protests or demonstrations,"" she said. ""But it's a good way to participate. It's not very aggressive."" Some approaches to vegan outreach are less subtle. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has had half-naked activists campaign against meat consumption by covering themselves in fake blood and lying in human-sized meat packages. PETA's theatrics may seem a far cry from a bake sale, but the organization sees the sales and protests as means of reaching the same goal. ""Even if [people] don't like the medium that we're using to get things across, we really just try to make sure they understand why we're doing it,"" said PETA senior campaigner Ashley Byrne. Gary Loewenthal, director of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale, said he believes bake sales can be a nice change of pace for people used to more confrontational forms of activism. ""I liked it because it combined this time-honored, well-liked tradition with vegan outreach,"" he said. He started planning last year's event from his home in Falls Church, Virginia, after brainstorming fundraising opportunities with Compassion for Animals, the animal advocacy group he helps run. Loewenthal sent invitations to cities all over the world and soon generated a buzz online. In 2009, the event had close to 100 participants and raised more than $25,000. Each group decides where to direct the proceeds of its own bake sale. While the money is not required to go to any specific type of organization, many opt to donate to nonprofit groups. Two events in Seattle, Washington, last week raised $1,770 for Pigs Peace Sanctuary, where Edgar, a potbellied pig, is being treated for a broken leg. Funds from a vegan bake sale in California on Sunday will benefit breast cancer research and education through the Avon Foundation. A group in Louisiana will send its proceeds to Food For Life, a vegan hunger-relief organization. When Loewenthal started researching vegan bake sales in 2008, a Google search yielded few results. Now, he says, one can find at least a handful of them taking place in any given month. In late January, more than 25 U.S. cities held vegan bake sales to raise money for Haiti hurricane relief. They were able to donate more than $75,000, according to organizer Isa Moskowitz, author of a number of vegan cookbooks. The growing popularity of vegan bake sales makes Loewenthal think about the future of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale. ""We've got some ideas going forward about how to keep it fresh,"" he said. ""But we're also prepared for it to be obsolete. ... We can call it a success and go on to something else.""","Second annual Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale runs from April 24 to May 2 .

"LINCOLN, Nebraska (CNN) -- Lincoln Industries looks like a typical blue-collar plant: workers cutting, bending, plating and polishing steel for products such as motorcycle tailpipes and truck exhausts amid the din of machinery. Howard Tegtmeier, right, leads co-workers in stretching before their shift starts at Lincoln Industries. But the 565-employee Nebraska company is different. Lincoln Industries has three full-time employees devoted to ""wellness"" and offers on-site massages and pre-shift stretching. Most unusual of all: The company requires all employees to undergo quarterly checkups measuring weight, body fat and flexibility. It also conducts annual blood, vision and hearing tests. ""When you get the encouragement from somebody to help you with nutrition and to help with a more active lifestyle, it makes it easier to be able to attain a lifestyle that most people want to attain anyway,"" says Hank Orme, president of Lincoln Industries. The program has been in place 16 years. The company ranks workers on their fitness, from platinum, gold and silver down to ""non-medal."" To achieve platinum, they must reach fitness goals and be nonsmokers -- and the company offers smoking cessation classes. For employees, reaching platinum means a three-day, company-paid trip each summer to climb a 14,000-foot peak in Colorado. This year, 103 qualified, the most ever. And 70 made the climb. For the company, the payoff is significantly lower health-care costs. The company pays less than $4,000 per employee, about half the regional average and a savings of more than $2 million. That makes the $400,000 Lincoln Industries spends each year on wellness a bargain.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta on wellness at work » . ""The return on investment is extraordinary,"" Orme says. The investment in ""wellness"" pays other dividends, according to Orme. He says fitter workers are more productive, have better morale and are safer. As evidence, he points to worker's compensation claims. Ongoing safety training and an increasingly fit work force have pushed worker's comp costs down from $500,000 five years ago to less than $10,000 so far this year. Seven years ago, shift leader Howard Tegtmeier was in the non-medal category. The 49-year-old smoked, drank, was overweight and took 12 pills a day to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. ""I just made the decision it was time to change my life, and the wellness program showed me ways to do that,"" Tegtmeier says. Tegtmeier says he no longer smokes or drinks. His weight is down from 230 to 180, thanks to diet and exercise. His cholesterol and blood pressure are also down, and he says he no longer needs medication. Tonya Vyhlidal, Wellness and Life Enhancement director, says Lincoln Industries doesn't pressure workers who don't want to participate. But sooner or later, she says, the company's ""culture"" attracts most employees to live healthier lives. The company sponsors  races, helps with gym memberships or exercise equipment, offers healthy choices in the vending machines and hosts classes on health and nutrition. ""There's a way to engage everyone. Even those that are really resistant,"" Vyhlidal says, adding that she'll offer employees suggestions based on what makes them feel fulfilled: ""Do you like to ride a bike? Ride a bike. Do you like to cook? You may need a different cookbook."" This month, Tegtmeier and 69 co-workers climbed Mount Bierstadt, a 14,060-foot mountain. All of them reached the summit. It was Tegtmeier's fourth climb with the company. ""The view up here is wonderful,"" he said.","Nebraska company grades employees on how healthy they are .

"(CNN) -- Drug violence in the Mexican state of Chihuahua left 24 people dead in the span of 24 hours this weekend, the state attorney general's office said Sunday. The killings were scattered over four locations throughout the state, with eight dead in Juarez, 10 killed in the capital of Chihuahua, five killed in Cuauhtemuc and one killed in Parral. All the slayings occurred in public places, with the killings in Cuauhtemuc occurring in a bar, said Carlos Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general. The killings took place between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, Gonzalez said. The victims -- all male -- ranged in age between 18 and 25 years old. No other details about the killings or the victims were immediately available. ""This is an indicator of the incrementally increasing war between the two cartels battling for Juarez Plaza, the state's drug trafficking corridor,"" Gonzalez said, referring to an ongoing battle between the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels for dominance in the area. Juarez Plaza is a major thoroughfare through the area. ""I can't give you a reason why the violence is picking up the last week of April going into this month,"" Gonzalez added. Some Mexican news organizations have reported that the Sinaloa Cartel had defeated the rival Juarez organization but Gonzalez said, ""There is no winner to this war."" The spate of weekend killings followed another bloody week in the Ciudad Juarez area. On Wednesday, at least 15 people were killed in drug-related violence in Juarez, authorities said. The slayings included four people whose bodies were found at one location, another three -- one of them a woman -- who were found slain at a second location, and another eight victims who were killed at a bar, police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. On Tuesday, 10 people were killed, Seguro said, including three who were shot outside a supermarket. Another victim was killed outside a shopping mall. In all, 25 people were killed between Tuesday and Wednesday, Seguro said. Ciudad Juarez is the most violent city in Mexico, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. No official numbers are available for this year, but more than 500 killings have been reported by local media. Some reports have the figures as high as 810 in Juarez this year. According to a report released in April by the Mexican government, Chihuahua state is Mexico's hardest-hit state by drug violence, with 6,757 people killed since the start of the drug war at the end of 2006.","Killings scattered over four locations throughout Mexican state of Chihuahua .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods admits his personal problems are affecting his game, but the world's top golfer refused to blame media intrusion on his life for his disastrous return to the PGA Tour this week. Woods defied expectation when he tied for fourth on his comeback last month at the Masters, one of golf's four major events, but struggled at the Quail Hollow Championship in North Carolina as he missed the halfway cut for only the sixth time in 14 years as a professional. On Friday, he slumped to a seven-over-par 79 that saw him miss the weekend rounds by eight shots -- and a massive 17 behind leader Billy Mayfair. It was his second-worst single-round score behind the 81 he carded at the 2002 British Open, and his highest 36-hole total meant he missed the cut in a non-major for the first time since 2005. The 34-year-old, who took a five-month break from playing following the scandal over his admitted marital infidelities, admitted he was feeling pressure due to continued questioning about his private life. ""Well, I get asked every day. Every day I do media, I get asked it, so it doesn't go away. Even when I'm at home, paparazzi still follow us, helicopters still hover around,"" Woods told reporters in quotes carried by his personal Web site. ""Does it test you? Yes, of course it does. Is that any excuse? No, because I'm out there and I have the same opportunity as everybody else here in this field to shoot a good number, and I didn't do that."" Woods will hope to address problems with his game ahead of the Players Championship at Ponte Vedra Beach in Florida starting next Thursday. ""It'll be interesting because I'll probably get home and hit balls on the range, and I'm going to have to get up there to Ponte Vedra a little early to putt because Isleworth is all torn up,"" he said. ""My short game was terrible. I three-putted there twice back-to-back, and you can't do that. I didn't get up-and-down at six and chipped the ball off the green at seven. Those shots, you're just throwing away shots when you do stuff like that. ""You have to let it go. It's like baseball, you go 0 for 4 two days in a row like I did, you've got a whole new tournament next week, which is great."" While Woods struggled at Quail Hollow, the 43-year-old Mayfair shot his second successive 68 to claim a one-shot lead from Argentina's Angel Cabrera. Last year's Masters champion, who played his first two rounds with Woods, fired a 67 featuring an eagle, four birdies and two bogeys. Current Masters champion Phil Mickelson also carded 68 to be in a tie for third another shot back on 138 along with fellow Americans J.P. Hayes (64), Dustin Johnson (65) and Paul Goydos (70). Meanwhile, England's Mark Foster will take a three-stroke lead into the final round of the Spanish Open in Seville. The world No. 363, seeking his second victory on the European Tour, carded a three-under-par 69 in his third round on Saturday. Spanish duo Alvaro Quiros (67) and Carlos Del Moral (70) were tied for second along with Frenchman Raphael Jacquelin (71).","Tiger Woods admits personal problems are affecting his golf, but refuses to blame media .

"(CNN) -- A male University of Virginia lacrosse player was charged with first degree murder Monday after a member of the school's women's lacrosse team was found dead in her apartment, police said. Police were initially called to the off-campus apartment by a roommate who reported ""a possible alcohol overdose,"" said Tim Longo, chief of police in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It was quickly apparent to them this young lady was the victim of something far worse,"" Longo said. Police identified the dead student as Yeardley Love, 22, a senior from Cockeysville, Maryland. Investigators ""fairly quickly"" focused on George Huguely from Chevy Chase, Maryland, as a suspect, Longo said. Huguely, a senior, is on the men's lacrosse team and was charged with murder, he said. Police are interviewing friends of Love and Huguely to determine what their relationship was, he said. ""That she appears now to have been murdered by another student compounds this sense of loss by suggesting that Yeardley died without comfort or consolation from those closest to her,"" University of Virginia President John Casteen said.

"(CNN) -- Myanmar's Supreme Court rejected Friday an appeal by pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to overturn her house arrest. A diplomat who attended the hearing and spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that the appeal was unsuccessful. Suu Kyi, 64, has one final avenue for appeal to a special court in Myanmar's new capital, Naypidaw. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's house arrest was extended by 18 months last August after an incident in which uninvited American John Yettaw stayed at her lakeside home. Myanmar's ruling military junta accused Suu Kyi of breaching the terms of her house arrest. She has been imprisoned or under house arrest for much of the past two decades, since her party the National League for Democracy won a landslide election victory in 1990. The junta has never recognized the results, but has promised to hold fresh elections this year, although no date has yet been set. Suu Kyi is disqualified from standing because she was married to a foreigner. The NLD has still to clarify whether it will participate in the vote.

"(CNN) -- When the January 12 earthquake hit Haiti, I watched hour upon hour of coverage on CNN. Like everyone else in the world, I saw images that were among the most horrifying caused by a natural disaster in our time. I had never been to Haiti at the time. Like many, I have friends and even family members of Haitian descent. But what occurred to me and most others were the questions: ""How could this happen and be so destructive?"" ""Why the lack of infrastructure?"" ""Why the lack of preparation for disaster?"" No country could be totally prepared for that kind of disaster, but Haiti and its people seemed to be particularly disadvantaged against Mother Nature's might. Click to find out more about CNN documentary ""Rescued"" I immediately got on my computer and began doing research, reading about Haiti's history. Admittedly, my American history dates were a bit foggy, so I tried to give myself a brief refresher. In school, we learned very early on about the abolition of slavery and Abraham Lincoln. But I was never taught that there was a small black nation in the Caribbean that had defeated Napoleon's army in 1803. That was the same year the French decided to sell their only other colony in the Western Hemisphere: Louisiana. Had the slaves, led by Toussaint L'Ouverture, not overthrown the French Army in Haiti, would the French have sold Louisiana to the United States? The Louisiana Purchase instantly doubled our country's size. Now, I have spent my time in Louisiana. I graduated from Louisiana State University. But I never linked these two events. I am sure historians do, but does the average American know that the Haitian revolution possibly played a large role in the history of the United States of America? So, I ask myself, had Toussaint L'Ouverture not lived, would America be the America it is today? If his army and the slaves had not defeated the French, would the French have wanted to sell their only other colony, so close to Haiti? So, the earthquake made me begin to read about history and look at events a little more closely. I do not understand why a country so close to some of the richest economies in the world could be in this position. I am not a political person by nature. But it does make you wonder how politically and historically, Haiti's own government and those of nearby countries have shown no accountability. That same day, I began to get calls from many organizations, people I do business with, friends asking for financial assistance and donations. I kept responding: ""Get back to me on what to do for the children."" ""Call me on what we can do with the schools."" ""Can someone find me someone dealing with the orphan situation?"" ""Are these kids going to be out on the streets being sold into God knows what?"" I continued to be overwhelmed with requests, and to be honest, was very concerned about people taking advantage, or looking for their ""moment in the spotlight to look like a savior,"" or that conversations seemed premature or were losing focus on the big picture. You could not be human and look at the images and hear the stories and not feel helpless and complete empathy for those who were suffering. Amid the chaos of what was unfolding on television, I tried my best to put myself in the place of the people and children who were living this reality. What does it feel like to lose a family member, or many family members and friends all at one time? Parents? Children? What does it feel like to be trapped inside a building that has fallen around you, in many cases for days, waiting for someone to find you and dig you out. What does it feel like to be hungry and without water for days at a time, not knowing if you will ever taste anything again? Now, months later: What does it feel like to be abandoned? What does it feel like to have a leg amputated, no parents, and live in a tent outside an orphanage that you cannot go inside? I can only imagine. I cannot walk in the shoes of those who lived it. I also realized that I know nothing about emergency response, foreign aid or medical care. What I do know is that I can be effective in keeping the light on a problem -- a problem that will not be solved for a long, long time. This is a country full of young children who will be permanently affected by this catastrophe. It is our responsibility to help Haiti solve this problem, as long as it takes to do it. We must not only rebuild the country, its roads, its buildings and its government. We also have to rebuild its children. It is an emergency to get these children back in schools. It was already an emergency before January 12, when a large percentage of children were not in school. It is an emergency to protect their human rights, it is an emergency to give them health services and prevent diseases that have long-term impact. We must treat these children like children. They need music and arts and sports. They need trained teachers who can educate and protect them during the school day. They need to have safe places to play. They need access to computer labs, technology and modern education tools. I decided this is what I would focus on. How could I lead in contributing for immediate needs -- but also for those that linger? A bed to sleep in and a roof over their heads. Schools. Computers. Teachers. Books. Soccer fields. Basketball courts. Parks. That is it. Our team traveled to Port-Au-Prince and Jacmel over the past few weeks, and we are returning again this month. We have joined in partnership with the United States Foundation for the Children of Haiti. The team met with the most amazing woman, Gladys Thomas, who has been serving the children in her homeland of Haiti since 1981. Thomas has led the foundation in developing a full spectrum of services for the growing number of children brought into her care. We will support her organization and work to support La Foundation Pour les Enfants d'Haiti, a nonprofit and nongovernmental Haitian organization. Our foundation O'Positive, along with Greenhouse International, will support the ongoing need to rebuild the infrastructure and buildings for School of Good Shower, Hope Hospital and Children's Hope Village, which both serve Haitian orphans in her care. O'Positive and I will also be working on a partnership with Save the Children and Harvard University Innovation Lab in Haiti to help provide infrastructure and quality education, teacher training and supplies the children need to succeed. So many people have already given so much. But this effort is just  beginning. It has been four months since that horrible day. One-third of a year. Thousands of children are sitting in tents each day, with nowhere to go and nothing to do. It is easy to forget about what is no longer on the front page or staring you down on your TV or computer. We get back to our normal lives. But remember, these children cannot resume their normal lives. We must not forget that in order to rebuild Haiti, we must rebuild its youth. We must not leave them behind. Their lives cannot end at the hands of an earthquake. Let's find the light in the storm, and build a future for the children.

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan stayed on course for the treble after beating Lazio 2-0 on Sunday to open up a two-point gap over Roma in the Serie A title race. It completed a superb week for Inter, who reached the final of the Champions League with an aggregate win over Barcelona on Wednesday. They also face Roma in the Italian Cup final next Wednesday having leapfrogged the capital side with their latest victory. Lazio, fighting a relegation battle, were no match for Jose Mourinho's high-flyers, who are bidding for a fifth straight league title. Argentine defender Walter Samuel headed in the opener just before halftime from a Wesley Sneijder cross. Inter continued to press after the break and Thiago Motta scored the second from a Maicon corner in the 70th minute. Roma had briefly led Serie A after their 2-1 win at Parma on Sunday with both teams now having two matches left to press their title claims. Earlier, Sampdoria and Palermo both won to stay locked in the battle for the fourth and final Champions League qualifying place. Sampdoria, who lead Palermo by two points, beat already relegated Livorno 2-0 while the Sicilians beat Siena 2-1. The defeat sends Siena down. In other games, Napoli and Juventus booked Europa League places. Napoli won 2-1 away to Chievo while Juve dropped to seventh, but secured their spot with a 1-1 draw at Catania. At the other end of the table, Bologna drew 1-1 with Atalanta to improve their chances of surviving the drop. In the Netherlands, FC Twente sealed the Dutch title with a 2-0 win over NAC Breda to leave them one point ahead of Ajax, who beat NEC Nijmegen 4-0. It is a remarkable triumph for a side managed by former England boss Steve McClaren who could not match the spending power of their Amsterdam rivals. Bryan Ruiz and Miroslav Stoch scored the Twente goals to clinch the championship and a Champions League place.","Inter Milan beat Lazio 2-0 to regain lead in Serie A from Roma .

"(CNN) -- Spain striker Fernando Torres may not be fit for the start of the World Cup, according to his English club Liverpool. The forward scored 18 goals in 22 games in the Premier League before his season was cut short by a knee injury. Torres had surgery to repair a torn cartilage in April and is now racing to be fit for Spain's opening game at the finals with Switzerland on June 16. Peter Brukner, Head of Sports Medicine and Sports Science at Liverpool, says the 26-year-old may not have recovered in time to launch his country's charge for the trophy. He told Liverpool's official Web site: ""You can't be absolutely certain of anything but at this stage, if he continues to progress the way he is, he should be fit to play at some stage during the World Cup. ""Whether he'll be fit for the first game or not is uncertain. We're anxious not to hurry him along too much because we want the long-term benefit, but we're aware he's got the short-term goal of playing in the World Cup."" Meanwhile, Germany coach Joachim Loew has been dealt a double blow ahead of the World Cup after goalkeeper Rene Adler and midfielder Simon Rolfes were ruled out of the tournament through injury. Adler has been told he needs surgery on a rib injury, aggravated while playing for his club Bayer Leverkusen during their weekend German Bundesliga draw with Hertha Berlin. He has been the country's number one since Robert Enke committed suicide in November 2009, and has nine caps to his name. ""This was the hardest decision of my life,"" Adler told the German Football Association's Web site. ""The pain is so great that I would not have been able to perform at my best over the longer term both in training and during matches. ""In such a long and intensive tournament, that is unacceptable. You need players who are totally fit."" Rolfes, who also plays for Leverkusen, has been out of action since an operation on a knee injury back in January and will not be adding to his 21 caps at the finals in South Africa. He said: ""I am very pleased with the healing process but it is now definitively clear that the World Cup finals for me make no sense. ""My plan is now to look to start the new Bundesliga season fully fit. Missing out on the World Cup is not easy. It only remains for me now to wish the team every success in South Africa."" Meanwhile, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has been left out of Holland's provisional World Cup squad, but coach Bert Van Marwijk says it doesn't necessarily spell the end of his World Cup dream. The 33-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward is currently playing for Hamburg in the Bundesliga. ""As for Ruud, I'm giving myself until May 11 to decide,"" Van Marwijk was quoted as saying in a story on FIFA's Web site.

"(CNN)  -- Here's a solid bet: At a few minutes after 6 p.m. on Saturday, Chef Jo-Jo Doyle will have goosebumps on his arms, and he'll be in dire need of a nap. The 35-year-old chef will have been at Churchill Downs since 5 a.m., working with his teams to prep, among other Southern treats, 1,892 sheets of Derby Pies, 18,000 barbecue sandwiches, 9,700 pounds of chicken, 11,520 Niman Ranch sausages (including a bourbon version specially made for the event) and 120,000 mint juleps to be served to more than 150,000 guests at the 136th annual Kentucky Derby. This isn't Chef Doyle's first time around the track, though. He's worked in the Churchill Downs' kitchens for four years, and this is his second stint as executive chef. He's learned to pace himself. ""It's basically like a family reunion,"" Doyle told CNN. ""The food is coming in waves all day long. There's breakfast, then second breakfast, then first lunch ... we're taking our hats off to Grandma here. You don't know what to do with yourself, so you just keep eating,"" Doyle said. Behind the scenes, hopefully, things will gallop right along. Read preview of the Kentucky Derby . ""I thrive on the energy in the kitchen, and I've learned it's like climbing a mountain. We train, test, pace, work and plan,"" he said. That's especially important this year, with his addition of some innovative new dishes alongside his family's classic succotash recipe and the track's standard barbecue, hot dogs and shrimp salad. The Alabama native collaborates closely with nearby farmers to be able to introduce some fresh -- as in picked 15 to 20 minutes earlier -- new flavors in the form of ""living greens,"" which are sponge-grown lettuces plucked from their roots right before they're served alongside Kentucky blue cheese. And ""Oh my goodness!"" he raves about local tomatoes from Kentucky Hydro. ""Fresh is best. I'm taking what chefs are doing every day. I'm just doing it for thousands and thousands of people."" He's also thrilled to be working with meat supplier Niman Ranch, which raises all their animals hormone-free, humanely and sustainably on family farms. Now about those juleps ... The track's staff will go through approximately 475,000 pounds of shaved ice, 7,800 liters of bourbon and 2,250 pounds of mint to quench loads of thirsty racegoers. Doyle notes that everyone has their own method. Some people use simple syrup, and others steep mint on their bourbon. But when the silver cup is in his hand, he'll grab a quantity of fresh Kentucky mint and, ""I muddle really well with sugar -- which does a really good job of releasing the oils. And I like crushed ice because it makes it cold quicker."" And he's got his crushing method down cold. No ""chewy"" little bits for him; he takes a couple of cubes in the palm of his hand and strikes them with the back of an ice cream scoop. So when does he finally get a chance to chill out? He'll step out of the kitchen, right before post time and listen to the crowd sing ""My Old Kentucky Home."" It's his favorite part of the whole day, and he gets goosebumps every time. The moment it's all over, it's back to the races. He assesses the day's performance and begins planning next year's menu, without pausing to take a victory lap. Like he says, ""Not everyone gets to be the chef at Churchill Downs."" Here are a few of the recipes used by Kentucky Derby fans: . Simple Mint Julep . Ingredients: 1 tsp sugar, handful of clean mint leaves and additional mint sprig, crushed ice, 3 oz of bourbon . Note: Juleps are traditionally served in silver cups because they retain an even chill. If you don't have one, a chilled tumbler will do just fine. Spoon the sugar into the bottom of the cup. Place the leaves on top of the sugar and crush, pushing down and twisting with a muddler or wooden spoon until slightly pulped. Fill the cup with crushed ice, pour the bourbon over the ice, garnish with the mint sprig and serve. Kat's Bourbon Slush . Bourbon slush was standard on party buffet tables when I was growing up in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, but I've rarely -- if ever -- seen it served outside of Northern Kentucky. That's a real shame. Here's a fairly standard recipe that packs a solid, sneaky alcohol wallop, as it goes down so very smoothly. It's easy to double, triple  or quadruple, but fair warning -- you can never have enough on hand, because no one ever has just one. My husband and I sampled it at our annual Derby Day party as well as our wedding. Now guests to subsequent soirees barely say hello upon arrival. Even the most demure bee-line for the freezer to scoop out a drink and then start in with the pleasantries. Ingredients: 12 ounces of lemonade, frozen concentrate; 6 oz of orange juice, frozen concentrate; 2 cups sugar; 2 cups hot strong tea; 2 cups bourbon; 7 cups water; ginger ale or lemon-lime soda to taste. In a lidded, freezer-proof container or two (Tupperware and Rubbermaid pitchers work well), stir together all ingredients except ginger ale until thoroughly blended. The concentrate should not be prediluted with water, and plain tea like Lipton or Red Rose works well. Place the container(s) in the freezer overnight or for at least 4-6 hours depending on the make and model of your appliance. It should be firm all the way through, but it will not freeze completely solid. Scoop around half to three quarters of a cup of the slush into a tumbler, top with ginger ale or lemon-lime soda to taste and serve. And did I mention how sneaky it is? Keep an eye on your guests, lest they slip too far into the slush pile. Note: Don't splurge on the good stuff for this. Save your Woodford and Booker's for sipping and juleps (and hand your Van Winkle on over this way). Evan Williams is cheap, respectable and gets the job done.","Chef Jo-Jo Doyle has worked at Churchill Downs' kitchen for four years .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo continued his sensational scoring form with a hat-trick on Wednesday night to keep Real Madrid's Spanish title hopes alive going into the final two matches of the season. Real trail Barcelona by one point after matching the defending champions' 4-1 victory over Tenerife the night before, coming from behind to defeat European hopefuls Mallorca. While world player of the year Lionel Messi took his tally to 44 goals with two more on Tuesday, Ronaldo is proving to be just as important to Real's chances. The Portugal forward, who became the world's most expensive player when he signed for $130 million from Manchester United in pre-season, has now scored 36 times this campaign. He followed up his double from Sunday's last-gasp 3-2 victory against Osasuna with another superb solo display, canceling out Aritz Aduriz's 16th-minute header with an opportunist effort 10 minutes later as he beat goalkeeper Dudu Aouate to a long ball by Sergio Ramos. Ronaldo put Real ahead 11 minutes after halftime with his 24th league goal this season, again combining with Ramos as he chested down the Argentine's pass and prodded the ball past Aouate. He made it 3-1 with 18 minutes to play as he skipped past two defenders on the left-hand edge of the penalty area and calmly slotted a low right-foot shot past the keeper to seal his first treble for the club. Gonzalo Higuain capped the victory 10 minutes later with a superb deft chip over Aouate after running clear for his 26th goal in La Liga this season, putting him behind only Messi's 31. This weekend, Real will host Athletic Bilbao while Barcelona travel to Sevilla, who reclaimed fourth place from Mallorca with a 5-1 victory at Racing Santander. Striker Alvaro Negredo followed up his weekend double with two more goals as Santander, who had Mohamed Tchite sent off for two bookings after he made it 3-1 on the hour, were left just a point above the bottom three. Eighth-placed Athletic Bilbao failed to return to the top six after a 1-1 home draw with Malaga, who moved above Santander on goal difference. Atletico Madrid kept up the fine end-of-season form that has seen Real's city rivals reach the finals of the Europa League and Copa Del Rey by defeating second-bottom Valladolid 3-1. Goals from Juanito, Jose Manuel Jurado and Diego Forlan put the ninth-placed hosts 3-0 up before a 78th-minute consolation by Jonathan Sesma as relegation-threatened Valladolid suffered a first defeat under former Spain coach Javier Clemente. Deportivo La Coruna were leapfrogged by Atletico after losing 3-1 at Osasuna, and now cannot qualify for the Europa League. Real Zaragoza moved five points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at home to Espanyol, who are a point above in 13th place, thanks to a second-half penalty from in-form striker Adrian Colunga.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores his first hat-trick for Real Madrid in 4-1 win at Mallorca .

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather will cement his position as the most bankable boxer in the world in Saturday night's non-title welterweight fight against fellow American Shane Mosley in Las Vegas. The 33-year-old, whose nicknames include ""Money,"" has already generated $292 million in revenue in six pay-per-view fights for broadcaster HBO, from 5.5 million buys. He is expected to take home $58.5 million for himself if the battle with veteran Mosley achieves two million subscribers. Mayweather is already fourth on the broadcaster's all-time list behind Oscar De La Hoya ($610.6 million on 12.6 million buys from 18 events), Mike Tyson ($545 million on 12.4 million buys, 12 bouts) and Evander Holyfield ($543 million on 12.6 million buys, 14 fights). De La Hoya and Tyson have both retired, while the 47-year-old Holyfield last month kept alive his unlikely dream of winning the world heavyweight title for a record fifth time by claiming the little-regarded WBF crown in front of just 3,000 people in Vegas. Mayweather's 2007 victory over De La Hoya earned a record $120 million for a single pay-per-view event from 2.15 million buys, and HBO told CNN that his fight with the 38-year-old Mosley is set to qualify as a true ""megafight."" ""In boxing, megafights are those that reach one million buys,"" HBO Pay-Per-View senior vice-president Mark Taffet said. ""By every indicator -- ticket sales, closed circuit television sales, views of video on the Internet, and the number of viewers of HBO's 24/7 series -- Mayweather-Mosley is on track to becoming a true PPV megafight. ""Whether on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, Internet, Facebook, MySpace, iTunes, Youtube, HBO, or at retail stores across the country, fans everywhere are surrounded by this great event. The Mayweather-Mosley buzz is everywhere."" Mayweather is undefeated in 40 fights, and has won six world titles at five different weights. However, he has lost his No. 1 ranking as the highly-regarded Ring Magazine's world's top pound-for-pound boxer to rival Manny Pacquiao. The two were due to clash earlier this year but the Filipino pulled out due to Mayweather's demands for Olympic-style blood-testing. ""Floyd Mayweather is a bonafide PPV superstar,"" Taffet said. ""He is one of most prolific performers in PPV history. ""But it takes two to make a true megafight and, like Floyd Mayweather, Shane Mosley is a future Hall-of-Famer and one of the most recognizable boxing stars of this era. Shane is a critical ingredient in the megafight status of Mayweather-Mosley. ""While Shane and Floyd definitely have very passionate fan bases in their hometowns [Lynwood, California and Grand Rapids, Michigan respectively], both Mayweather and Mosley are national figures with broad and diverse fan bases throughout the entire U.S. ""As the 'Who R U Picking?' polls indicate, fans everywhere are talking about this matchup and it is virtually a 50-50 split as to who the fans think will win."" While many pundits expect Mayweather and Pacquiao to agree to fight by the end of this year, the American has taunted the Filipino by saying he is not enough of a box office draw. Pacquiao's fights with De La Hoya and Juan Marquez brought in significantly fewer buys than Mayweather's clashes with the duo. ""He needs to learn how to do numbers like I'm doing,"" Mayweather, who shunned the chance of winning the WBA belt against Mosley as he did not want to pay the sanctioning fees, told Boxingscene.com. ""He needs to step his game up. I'm not worried about this [Mosley fight]. I know I'm going to do crazy numbers. I should walk away with about $40 million. With or without Pacquiao I'm going to be able to go out and make $20 million or $30 million a night.""","Floyd Mayweather is fourth in all-time list of revenue earners in pay-per-view fights .

"(CNN) -- A suspect charged in the failed Times Square car bombing is a Pakistani who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2009 and used to work as a financial analyst in Connecticut. Faisal Shahzad, 30, most recently of Bridgeport, Connecticut, was arrested Monday night at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York as his flight to Dubai was about to take off, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities had put him on a no-fly list earlier in the day, with investigators having determined that he had purchased the vehicle used in Saturday's failed bombing attempt, FBI Deputy Director John Pistole said Tuesday. Customs and Border Protection agents reacted quickly to the name match and made the arrest, Pistole said. Shahzad has been charged with five counts in connection with the case, according to documents filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York. According to the documents, he admitted to law enforcement officials that he attempted to detonate the bomb and that he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan region of Pakistan. Also according to the complaint, Shahzad returned to the United States via a one-way ticket from Pakistan on February 3. He had told immigration officials upon his return that he had been visiting his parents in Pakistan for the previous five months, the complaint said. Shahzad has a Karachi identification card, a sign of Pakistani residency, and his family is from northwestern Pakistan, according to Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik. His father is a retired senior officer in the Pakistani Air Force, Shahzad's cousin, Kafayat Ali, said on Tuesday. The father, Bahar Ul Haq, a former air vice marshal, lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad in Pakistan. Shahzad came to the United States and attended college, earning a bachelor's degree in computer applications and information systems from Connecticut's University of Bridgeport in 2000. He earned an MBA at the school in 2005. He started working as a junior financial analyst for Affinion Media Group in Norwalk, Connecticut, in 2006, leaving voluntarily in June 2009, according to Affinion spokesman Michael Bush. Before what the court document says was Shahzad's trip to Pakistan, he lived in Shelton, Connecticut. A woman who said she had lived next door to him in Shelton told CNN on Tuesday that the man she knew didn't say much and claimed to work on Wall Street in New York. ""He was quiet. He would wear all black and jog at night. He said he didn't like the sunlight,"" Brenda Thurman said. She said Shahzad, his wife and two children and his wife's two sisters lived next to her for about three years, moving out in July 2009. People whom she believes were plainclothes law enforcement officers appeared to be staking out the house Monday, Thurman told CNN affiliate WTNH-TV. The neighbor said she often saw Shahzad leaving the home in the morning and returning in the evening. She also saw him in his yard with his children, a boy and a girl, and the family usually wore traditional Muslim attire, she told WTNH-TV. She said she never suspected he might be involved in a possible terror attack. ""I didn't think he was capable of doing something like that. ... I'm very shocked,"" she said. Thurman said her daughter often played with Shahzad's daughter, but she herself didn't have much contact with the family. Shahzad's wife spoke English, but was apparently so insecure about her language ability that she told people she did not, Thurman said. ""I never knew she spoke English until it was time for her to move,"" Thurman said. Shahzad's wife told Thurman in July 2009 that the family was moving to Missouri. A few weeks after they left their home, the lender foreclosed on the property and changed the locks, the neighbor said. At the Bridgeport residence where authorities say he lived most recently, agents with the FBI and local police, including members of a bomb squad, conducted a search, and investigators removed filled plastic bags. Cell phone calls conducted for the purchase of the vehicle used in Saturday's bombing attempt helped lead police to the suspect, law enforcement sources said. Sources said investigators got cell phone information from the daughter of the Nissan Pathfinder owner. She sold the vehicle to Shahzad on behalf of her father. She had been talking on the phone to Shahzad in arranging the purchase of the SUV, which was advertised for sale on Craigslist. The Nissan Pathfinder was parked in Times Square containing propane tanks, fertilizer and gasoline on Saturday night. After police retrieved the vehicle identification number of the Pathfinder, they located the registered owner of the vehicle. The sources said the owner's daughter had met with Shahzad at a Stratford, Connecticut, grocery store, for the sale. Shahzad took the car for a test drive in the parking lot and bought the vehicle for $1,300 in cash. Bridgeport is a working class city of 130,000 on Long Island Sound, 66 miles northeast of New York City. Per capita income there is 26 percent below the national average, and 27 percent of its residents are foreign-born, more than twice the national average, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The edges of the massive Gulf Coast oil slick grazed the barrier islands off Louisiana's Chandeleur and Breton sounds Tuesday as the company responsible for cleaning up the spill faced tough questions from members of Congress. With a damaged undersea well still spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana's coastal parishes made new plans to keep the oil from moving into Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain, which flank New Orleans. Winds that complicated efforts to fight the spill died down Tuesday, making cleanup work easier, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said. ""It's a gift of a little bit of time,"" she told reporters. ""But I'm not resting."" The spill threatens wildlife, beaches and livelihoods along the Gulf Coast. Already federal officials have banned fishing in the affected area until at least May 12, curtailing a commercial seafood industry that brings in about $2.4 billion to the region every year. The leading edge of the slick was reported to be lapping at the edge of Louisiana's Chandeleur Islands early Tuesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said. ""Let's make no mistake about what's at stake here. This is our very way of life,"" Jindal told reporters. ""This is our fishing communities, these are some of our coastal communities. We're talking about keeping this oil out of our fragile wetlands."" But as of mid-afternoon, no oil had been found washed up on the islands, said Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP, which owns the damaged well. ""To give you a sense of our ability to respond, we launched 22 vessels,"" Suttles told reporters at a news conference in Mobile, Alabama. Twelve of those vessels were shrimp boats whose skippers have volunteered to assist in the cleanup, he said. ""They've been in the area ever since trying to locate that oil and make sure it actually doesn't reach shore,"" Suttles said. The edge of the slick was reported to be about 20 miles off the Mississippi Coast, and Landry said it was about 30 miles off the shores of Alabama. Suttles said BP workers expected to close off one of the three leaking points Tuesday, but added, ""I don't believe that will change the total amount of oil that will be leaked."" Stephen Herbert, chef and owner of Abita Springs Cafe on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, said the potential impact was ""tremendous."" But Herbert, who holds a degree in fish biology and lived in the marshes for 10 years before entering the restaurant business, expressed surprise that the story has become a national one. ""I'm really astounded that the rest of the people in the United States really give a flip about this,"" he said. Louisiana's coastal marshlands have been shrinking at the rate of two football fields a day for a quarter-century, he said, ""and nobody gave a flip about that."" Herbert's 16-table restaurant, located 25 miles from New Orleans, specializes in Cajun food, and at least half of his orders are for meals that contain fish. In anticipation of rising prices, he ordered an extra gallon of shucked oysters and another case of shrimp, but that was all his refrigerators could store, the 56-year-old restaurateur said. The estimated 210,000-gallon-per-day flow of oil from the damaged well continued unabated Tuesday, 12 days after the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon sank off Louisiana. The break in the winds kept the slick from advancing much toward the coast, but Jindal said the weather is expected to turn unfavorably Thursday. The first oil was not expected to reach the shores of the U.S. mainland for another three days, Suttles said. As owner of the well, BP is responsible for the cleanup and its costs. It blames Transocean, which it hired to drill the well, for the failure of a critical piece of equipment that was designed to shut off the well in case of emergency. Across the Gulf Coast, emergency workers and volunteers helped string floating booms across inlets and beaches in an attempt to fend off any advancing oil. Chocolate-colored streaks of oily water could be seen off Dauphin Island, on the Alabama coast. And crew boats that normally supply oil wells were laying booms around Ship Island, off the shores of Mississippi and about 10 miles north of the spill's leading edge. But Capt. Louis Skrmetta, who runs excursions out to the Mississippi Sound barrier islands, said efforts to protect the islands and waterways were inadequate. He said Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour -- who called the spill ""a manageable problem"" Monday -- was doing less to combat the oncoming slick than his counterparts in Alabama and Louisiana. KNOE: Community rallies around rig families . ""The governor's leaving it up to BP. They're just not doing enough,"" Skrmetta said. BP hopes to place a four-story-high metal container over part of the leaking drill pipe, a step it says could corral about 80 percent of the leaking oil. The oil would then be pumped to a drill ship on the surface. Suttles said the 70-ton box could be ferried out to the site of the leak by midnight Wednesday, but it will take another two days to place the device on the seabed. Then it must be connected to the drill ship. ""Hopefully, we'll be operational within about about six days,"" he said. Hundreds of thousands of feet of booms have been strung around the estuaries of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and far western Florida in recent days. But an aerial tour conducted by the Coast Guard on Tuesday showed some have already given way, and high winds in recent days have driven oil past others. The Deepwater Horizon caught fire April 20 and burned for two days before sinking, with 11 workers presumed dead. Executives from BP and Transocean Ltd., looked ""like deer in the headlights"" when they briefed members of the House Energy and Environment committee about the accident and response on Tuesday, said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas. KATC: Gulf shrimp season to temporarily close . Barton is a strong supporter of offshore drilling, and told reporters he didn't want the accident to reverse support for more exploration off the U.S. coasts. But he said he had hoped for ""more concrete"" answers from the oilmen. ""I have concerns in this particular case about the attention to safety, the attention to maintenance, the attention to using best available control technology and best monitoring practices,"" Barton said. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, said the situation could get dramatically worse. ""One of the questions which I asked was what would happen if a worst-case scenario did unfold?"" he told reporters after the hearing. ""I was told that the amount of oil per day could actually rise from 5,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day, although in a worst-case scenario, the most likely number was in the 40,000 barrel range, which only reinforces the necessity of us acting as quickly as possible, for BP and all responsible, for shutting off this catastrophic leak of oil."" But Dave Nagel, the executive vice president of BP America, said the company is ""doing everything we can to respond to this incident."" ""That's our complete focus right now -- to stop the leak at the scene, to disperse the oil the best we can and protect the beaches and mitigate the impact,"" he said. ""That's what we're doing."" That may not be enough to satisfy lawmakers, said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida. ""Privately, I've gone up to some senators who have been for drilling and I have sarcastically said to them, in a whisper, 'Drill, baby, drill,' and they roll their eyes as if in mock horror at the possibilities of what could happen as a result of this disaster."" CNN's Mark Biello, Dave Rust and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Oil laps islands that hold national wildlife refuge, says Louisiana governor .

"(CNN) -- What really motivates us? And what motivational techniques lead us to work smarter and live better? Those are questions that behavioral scientists around the world have been exploring for the past half-century. Their answers might surprise you. In laboratory experiments and field studies, a band of psychologists, sociologists and economists have found that many carrot-and-stick motivators -- the elements around which we build most of our businesses and many of our schools -- can be effective, but that they work in only a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances. For enduring motivation, the science shows, a different approach is more effective. This approach draws not on our biological drive or our reward-and-punishment drive, but on what we might think of as our third drive: Our innate need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. In particular, high performance -- especially for the complex, conceptual tasks we're increasingly doing on thejob -- depends far more on intrinsic motivators than on extrinsic ones. Read more about Daniel Pink's talk at TEDGlobal2009 . With these conclusions in mind, here are a few ways to tap your third drive and enlist the science of motivation at work, with your children and in your personal life. WORK: Try a FedEx Day . The Australian software company Atlassian has an ingenious method for stoking innovation. Once a quarter, on a Thursday afternoon, they allow their developers to work on anything they want, any way they want and with whomever they want. The only requirement is that people have to show what they've created to the rest of the company at a fun and spirited meeting 24 hours later. Atlassian calls these sessions ""FedEx Days"" because people have to deliver something overnight. These one-day bursts of autonomy have produced an array of fixes for existing software and ideas for new products that might not have emerged otherwise. This isn't management through carrots and sticks. It's innovation through autonomy. You can give this a whirl at your organization. Set aside an entire day when employees can work on anything they choose, however they want, with whomever they'd like. Make sure they have the tools and resources they need. And impose just one rule: People must deliver something -- a new idea, a prototype of a product, a better internal process -- the following day. The results might amaze you. CHILDREN: Give your children an allowance and some chores -- but don't combine them . In the peculiar world of human motivation, sometimes adding two positives can give you a negative. Take the case of chores and allowances. Both are good. Chores show kids that families are built on mutual obligations and that all members need to help each other. Allowances teach kids to be responsible for, and manage, their own money. But combining the two is a big mistake. By linking money to the completion of chores, parents turn an allowance into what I call an ""if- then"" reward (as in ""If you do this, then you get that."") The science is very clear that ""if-then"" rewards, while effective in some circumstances, can trigger an avalanche of unintended consequences. In this case, the carrot of payment sends kids a clear (and clearly wrongheaded) message: In the absence of cash, no self-respecting child would willingly set the table, empty the garbage or make her own bed. It converts a moral andfamilial obligation into just another commercial transaction -- and teaches that the only reason to do a less-than-desirable task for your family is for payment. So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs. PERSONAL: Find your sentence . Clare Booth Luce, one of the first women to serve in Congress, once said, ""a great man is a sentence."" What she meant was that anybody who ever achieved anything of enduring significance wasn't running in 17 directions at once. Those who leave left a lasting imprint -- not just on their country, but also on their families and communities -- are animated by a singular purpose. One of the best ways to find your purpose is to ask yourself a variation of Luce's question: What's my sentence? When all is said and done, how to do you wanted to be remembered? How will the world be different because of your presence on it? Your sentence need not be George Washington-esque in its scope. (""He led a revolution from tyranny and helped guide a young democracy."") Maybe it's ""she served every patient who came into her office whether or not that person could pay."" Maybe it's ""he taught two generations of children how to read."" Maybe it's ""she raised four children who are now happy and healthy adults."" There are few better navigational tools than to find your North Star of purpose. So ask yourself: What's my sentence? You might find the answer motivating. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Pink.","Our traditional idea of motivation is to reward good behavior with money, Daniel Pink says .

He says many people motivated by need to be creative, productive, independent .

"(CNN)  -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late headed winner as Real Madrid stayed a point behind leaders Barcelona in the Spanish title race after a dramatic 3-2 win over Osasuna on Sunday night. Real had to come from behind twice in the Bernabeu with former World Player of the Year Ronaldo grabbing a double. Trailing by four points after Barcelona's 4-1 win over Villarreal on Saturday, Real made a disastrous start as a poor back pass by Raul Albiol allowed in Carlos Aranda to give Osasuna an early lead. Ronaldo then came to the rescue for the first time as he equalized with a fine strike from just outside the penalty area, but Real were soon behind again as   Krisztian Vadocz struck home Osasuna's second. But with time running out in the first half, Marcelo headed Real level again. Osasuna refused to lie down and substitute Masoud Soleimani missed the easiest of several chances for the visitors as Real pushed forward for a winner. The game appeared to be headed for a draw, which would have severely dented Real's title hopes with games running out, until Ronaldo popped up to score an 89th minute goal from a cross by Gonzalo Higuain. A double from Lionel Messi had helped Barca to rebound from their Champions League exit at the hands of Inter Milan to leave them on course to defend their La Liga crown with a fine win over Villarreal. In other action on Sunday, Alvaro Negredo scored two penalties to give Sevilla a 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid to lift them into the fourth and the final Champions League place. The match was a forerunner to the Copa del Rey final later this month. Atletico, who are also in the Europa League final, fell behind to a Luis Fabiano strike after five minutes. Tiago Cardoso equalized for Atletico who were then undone by Negredo's two spot kicks. A double from substitute Nicola Zigic saw Valencia beat Espanyol 2-0 to keep a tight hold on third place. Getafe were held goalless by Valladolid and Tenerife beat Racing Santander 2-1 but remain in the drop zone as Malaga drew 1-1 with Sporting Gijon.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice including a late headed winner for Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- The 2009 snooker world champion John Higgins has said his ""conscience is clear"" following allegations of match fixing. British newspaper The News of the World claimed the 34-year-old accepted a $398,000 bribe to throw frames in future matches during a meeting with undercover reporters in Kiev, Ukraine. However, in a statement read out on the BBC, the Scotsman denied ever intentionally losing a match or taking a bribe at any point in his career. ""My conscience is 100 percent clear,"" said Higgins. ""I have never been involved in any form of snooker match fixing ... I have never deliberately missed a shot, never mind intentionally lost a frame or a match."" Snooker's governing body -- The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) -- announced through an official statement that Higgins had been suspended from future tournaments pending an investigation. The same statement confirmed his manager, Pat Mooney, resigned from his position on the board of the WPBSA after he was alleged to have been at the meeting with Higgins in Kiev. The three-time world champion claimed clearing his name will be the biggest challenge of his career and he will assist snooker authorities with the forthcoming investigation. ""Today is the start of the biggest match of my life. I will co-operate fully with the snooker authorities. I have built my reputation on honesty and integrity."" Higgins is one of the most successful snooker players in history and has won game's top prize on three occasions, taking last year's championship in addition to previous triumphs in 1998 and 2007. This is not the first time controversy of this kind has hit the sport. In 2006 Australian Quinten Hann was given an eight-year ban from the sport when he was found guilty of breaking rules relating to match-fixing. Match fixing in sport is frequently linked to illegal betting syndicates, where bribes are offered to influence the outcomes of sporting events. Simon Clare, a spokesperson for British-based bookmakers Coral, believes worldwide regulations on gambling would prevent illegal betting. ""The sports betting market is absolutely immense, it's millions [of dollars] a week being bet.

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly two weeks after an explosion aboard an oil rig caused a leak from an undersea oil well off Louisiana, the impact is just beginning to unfold. Though the widening pool of oil remained offshore Monday, it was already a presence for some coastal areas. John Kelly, administrator of Gulfport, Mississippi, said he had been able to smell it since Friday. ""I got $3 million worth of boats sitting here,"" said Capt. Louis Skrmetta, who ferries tourists from Gulfport to the state's pristine barrier islands. ""What am I going to do with them?"" BP's ruptured undersea well continues to spew about 210,000 gallons -- or 5,000 barrels -- of crude per day into the Gulf of Mexico. Efforts to contain or curtail the spill have been unsuccessful. The sheen extends up to 60 miles across and threatens the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That's an area nearly as large as the state of Delaware. The slick was nine miles off the Louisiana coast Monday, said Adm. Thad Allen, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard and incident commander. BP chief executive Tony Hayward vowed that the oil giant would ""absolutely be paying for the cleanup operation"" of the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. ""Where legitimate claims are made, we will be good for them,"" he told NPR's ""Morning Edition."" The U.S. government was leaving little to chance. Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that Justice Department employees were in the Gulf region ""to ensure that BP is held liable."" Allen said BP ""is the responsible party"" and ""will bear all the costs"" of the cleanup. Still, the promises failed to quell the fears. ""I hope we can weather the storm,"" said Keith Delcambre, owner of seafood market Bozo's in Pascagoula, Mississippi. WLOX: Pass Christian Harbor in Mississippi prepares for oil . He said the nature of the current disaster could exact more of a toll on seafood than  Hurricane Katrina, which savaged the Gulf Coast in August 2005. ""We weathered Katrina, but shrimp after Katrina was good,"" he said. ""Seafood after Katrina was good. With all the oil out there, I don't know what to expect. This is brand new."" In Gulfport, officials worried that a drop in tourism from the slick would chill the city's post-Katrina rebound, which includes half a billion dollars in new construction, $30 million of which has been spent on the harbor. ""This could not have happened at a worse time in our history,"" Kelly, the city's administrator, said. Katrina left equipment operator Daniel Schepens out of work for a month, but the oil slick could prove worse, he said. ""The warehouses are empty. No trucks, no imports, no exports."" ""If it threatens the commercial sea lanes, that's a concern, because if ships don't come in and ships aren't able to go out, that stops commerce,"" said Donald Allee, CEO of the Mississippi State Port Authority. WWL: Fishermen try to help contain oil slick . For now, the harbor is being used as a loading point for hundreds of miles of booms that are intended to defend against the slick's arrival. But the booms may not protect the coast any more than the levees protected New Orleans during Katrina: Rough seas have already broken apart some of the booms. WDSU: Rush to save Lake Pontchartrain . Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist on Monday extended a state of emergency to 13 coastal counties in his state and said he might extend it to two more on Tuesday. He had issued an emergency declaration last week for six counties on the western end of the Florida Panhandle; Monday's declaration added the rest of the Panhandle, and counties on the Gulf Coast of the main Florida peninsula as far south as Sarasota. ""In the event that the oil does come to our shores, I want us to be ahead of it as much as humanly possible,"" he told reporters. Preparations continue on strategies to stop the leak, though each plan has drawbacks. One plan is to lower a dome over the wellhead next week to capture the spewing oil, said Florida Secretary of Environmental Protection Michael Sole. ""That would stop the flow -- if successful,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it's never been tried at 5,000 feet below the surface of the water."" Officials warn of possible catastrophe . BP also is having a contractor drill a relief well that would allow workers to plug the first well. ""Unfortunately, that's a two- to three-month operation,"" Sole said. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Obama White House officials met Monday afternoon with Hayward and BP America President Lamar McKay to discuss the response efforts. On Sunday, federal officials banned fishing for at least 10 days in the northern Gulf of Mexico from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to waters off Florida's Pensacola Bay. The Gulf Coast's commercial fishing industry brings in about $2.4 billion to the region. WDSU: Oil spill closes fishing waters . The spill cast a pall over the annual boat blessing ceremony in St. Bernard, Louisiana, where fishermen have observed the tradition for decades to usher in the shrimp season. On Monday, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, joined Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser on a conference call with President Obama and Coast Guard officials. Officials are fighting the spill on three fronts, Napolitano said Monday. ""One is to cap the well"" that is leaking the oil, she said. Authorities are also fighting the slick at sea before it reaches land, and preparing to clean it up immediately if it does make landfall, she said. In Venice, Louisiana, Obama told reporters Sunday that his administration has launched a ""relentless response"" to the spill, but the problem might not be solved for many days. WDSU: Fishermen to help oil cleanup . The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on BP contractor Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform left 11 men presumed dead. The spill will have ""a multidecade impact,"" a ""long-term poisoning"" of the area, said Richard Charter of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Booms were strung across the mouths of delta estuaries in Louisiana and inlets along the Mississippi coast. In Alabama, National Guard troops helped lay them out off Dauphin Island, at the southern end of Mobile Bay. The cause of the blast remains unknown. BP says a device known as a ""blowout preventer"" failed and has not responded to repeated attempts to activate it using remotely operated submarines. How the oil spill crisis could affect BP . Frustration with BP has been growing across the Gulf states, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said the company's response has been inadequate. Some 200 vessels, including skimmers, tugboats and nine remotely operated underwater vehicles are on or near the site, BP's Chief Operating Officer Douglas Suttles told reporters. BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said the company was trying to use the submarines to activate the blowout preventer at the ocean floor and spreading dispersants on and under the water to break up the slick. The company has put out about 300,000 feet -- roughly 60 miles -- of floating booms to keep the oil away from ecologically sensitive shorelines, she said. But she said efforts to skim oil off the surface were put off because of bad weather. ""Some of the vessels can't get out,"" she said. ""But they are still making the effort.""

"(CNN) -- For most of American history, a Supreme Court with no Protestant Christian judges would have been unthinkable. Nearly three quarters of all justices who've ever served on the nation's high court have been Protestant. And roughly half of all Americans identify themselves as Protestant today. But since John Paul Stevens announced his retirement last month, legal and religious scholars have begun entertaining the unprecedented prospect of a Supreme Court without a single Protestant justice. Besides Stevens, who is Protestant, the current Supreme Court counts six Catholics and two Jews. ""It's an amazing irony given how central Protestantism has been to American culture,"" said Stephen Prothero, a religion scholar at Boston University. ""For most of the 19th century, Protestants were trying to turn America into their own heaven on Earth, which included keeping Jews and Catholics from virtually all positions of power."" Many religion scholars attribute the decline of Protestants on the high court to the breakdown of a mainline Protestant identity and to the absence of a strong tradition of lawyering among evangelical Protestants. ""Mainline Protestantism isn't a pressure group,"" said Prothero, ""It's not like the National Council of Churches is lobbying Obama to get a Lutheran appointed to the Supreme Court."" And while Judaism and Catholicism have their own sets of religious laws that date back millennia, many branches of Protestant Christianity do not. For much of the last 150 years, evangelical Christianity has stressed an emotional theology of ""heart"" over ""head"" -- not a recipe for producing legal scholars with eyes fixed on the Supreme Court. ""Evangelicals have put more effort into getting elected than in getting onto the bench,"" said Michael Lindsay, a Rice University professor who has studied evangelical elites. ""Electoral politics is more similar to the style of rallying of around revival campaign than it is to the arduous journey of producing intellectual giants that could be eligible for the Supreme Court."" President Obama is expected to nominate Stevens' replacement early this month. Of the three candidates who are reported to lead Obama's short list, two -- Solicitor General Elena Kagan and federal appeals judge Merrick Garland -- are Jewish, while one, federal appeals judge Diane Wood, is a Protestant. Obama's first Supreme Court appointee, Sonia Sotomayor, is Catholic. One explanation of Catholics' and Jews' high court hegemony is that members of both traditions have long pursued legal degrees as a way to assimilate into a majority Protestant country. ""Most American Catholic law schools were not formed to be elite institutions of lofty legal scholarship, but as way to respond to the fact that other law schools were excluding Catholics,"" said Richard Garnett, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. ""It was a vehicle to get Catholics into the middle class."" ""Early on, those schools admitted a lot of Jewish students who were being discriminated against,"" Garnett said. Today, Catholic law schools at Georgetown University, Fordham University, and Notre Dame are considered among the best in the country. Evangelical Protestant colleges, meanwhile -- including Regent University and Liberty University, founded by Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, respectively -- have opened law schools only since the 1980s. And law schools with Protestant roots -- like Harvard and Yale -- shed their religious identities a long time ago, part of the broader fading of a distinct mainline Protestant identity in the U.S.. Some legal and religious scholars say the dearth of qualified evangelical candidates for the Supreme Court came into sharp relief in 2005, when President George W. Bush nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers to the high court. An evangelical Christian who the White House promoted strenuously among evangelicals, Miers' nomination was brought down largely by conservatives -- nonevangelicals, mostly -- who said she was not qualified for the position. In the last couple of decades, however, more evangelicals have begun pursuing legal degrees, including at elite colleges. ""There are now vibrant Christian fellowships at Harvard and Yale,"" said Lindsay. ""Ten years from now, it will be entirely possible to see an evangelical Protestant on the Supreme Court."" Rachel Heflin, a senior at Patrick Henry College -- a Virginia school whose students are mostly evangelicals from homeschooling backgrounds -- said many of her friends are heading to law school next year. ""When your circle of friends is comprised of aspiring lawyers, the joke is about who's going to make it to the high court first,"" said Heflin, an evangelical Christian who will be attending George Washington University Law School on scholarship. Which means that a Protestant Supreme Court resurgence may not be too far off.","Current Supreme Court has six Catholics, two Jews and one Protestant .
Absence of a strong tradition of lawyering among evangelical Protestants .
Only one of the Supreme Court candidates on Obama's short list is a Protestant .

"(CNN) -- The medals have been presented, the caldron extinguished and the crowds dispersed, but there's one record from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics that may have been overlooked: Most condoms distributed at a Winter Games. It's hard to say this conclusively, and judges from other host cities may demand a recount, but Clay Adams of Vancouver Coastal Health said the word on the public health street is that Vancouver is king of the prophylactic winter rings. Over the course of 17 days, the health agency doled out 100,000 condoms, supplied by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. And after buzz, some based on rumors, grew that there was a shortage -- ""We were not getting calls from people saying, 'Help, I need condoms,'"" Adams laughed -- an emergency shipment of 8,500 additional rubbers came in from the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research. Some media outlets reported that the supply was strictly for Olympic and Paralympic athletes and officials, totaling about 6,500 people according to the Vancouver Organizing Committee. That would suggest an average of at least 15 condoms per person, and rampant sex of Olympic proportions. But Adams, spokesman for Vancouver Coastal Health, clarified and said the free condoms were available not just to athletes and game officials. They were on the cruise ships that housed security, support staff and volunteers. They were in washrooms at public venues, including the downtown pavilions where visitors gathered for free concerts. They were handed out by volunteers and readily available in clinics. The mass distribution of rubbers was part of a greater effort to improve HIV and AIDS awareness, Adams said. Lots of people don't have the same kind of access to public health messages about disease prevention, and ""when you've got a global audience like this, it's a huge opportunity to educate the world,"" he said. Since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, condoms have been distributed free to athletes. About 40,000 of the original 100,000 in Vancouver were for those staying in the athlete villages in Vancouver and Whistler, Adams said. How many of them were actually used is an impossible question to answer. Some say condoms were snagged as souvenirs, although Adams said they were not branded with Olympic rings. He said he did hear stories of athletes from countries with inferior condoms stuffing their suitcases with the coveted rubbers. But no matter what happened to the condoms, the public health effort in Vancouver is one that makes him proud. ""Indications are that Vancouver topped the podium for Winter Olympics,"" Adams said. ""Although we recently heard that they issued 35 million condoms for Mardi Gras in Rio, so I suppose we all have a long, long way to go to reach that mark.""","Other may want a recount, but it seems Vancouver's tops for Winter Games condoms .

"(CNN) -- Some of the worst flooding the mid-South has seen in decades is thought to be responsible for at least 11 deaths in Tennessee, the Nashville and state emergency management offices said Sunday. Five of the deaths were in Davidson County, which encompasses Nashville, according to the Nashville mayor's Office of Emergency Management. The rains have closed interstate highways, displaced thousands from their homes, prompted evacuations of hotels and nursing homes and turned city streets and parking lots into raging rivers. Parts of the state have been drenched with up to 20 inches of rain, with more expected. iReport: Experiencing the Tennessee floods? Send photos, video . On Sunday night, multiple vehicles were trapped by water on Interstate 40 with water rising around them and with authorities working since the afternoon to get to the cars, according to the Office of Emergency Management. Authorities have recovered bodies from a flooded house in Nashville and from an upside down vehicle floating on a flooded road, among other places, the mayor's office said in a release Sunday night. Two young men who'd gone tubing on a flooded creek on Sunday evening were missing, the mayor's office said. Also on Sunday night, authorities were working to evacuate more than 500 residents from the MetroCenter in north Nashville. ""All of our major creeks and the Cumberland River are near flood level, if not at flood level,"" Nashville Mayor Karl Dean said at a press conference Sunday, referring to the waterway that bisects Nashville. ""The ground is entirely saturated, and the rain continues to fall. There's nowhere for the water to go."" The western two thirds of Tennessee has seen between 6 and 20 inches of rain since Saturday, with flooding spreading to Kentucky on Sunday. In Nashville alone, more than 600 people were rescued from the water this weekend, Dean said. Dean said Sunday that more rain has fallen in Nashville in the last 24 hours than has ever been recorded in the city. Video: Nashville resident captures 'practically a class two rapids' on her neighborhood streets . ""We are still at this point in rescue stage and will be until the water begins to subside,"" he said. Dean urged residents to stay home Sunday and, if they could, to skip work on Monday, when Nashville schools will be closed and public transportation will be suspended. Two of the three temporary shelters -- which can each house 200 people -- opened by the Nashville mayor's office had reached capacity by Sunday evening. The Red Cross reported approximately 400 people in 22 shelters throughout Tennessee. The floods shut down parts of interstates 24, 40 and 65 around Nashville on Saturday and Sunday. The floods left 36,000 houses around Nashville without power on Sunday, while all Davidson County residents were asked to use water for essential purposes only after flooding closed one of the city's water treatment plants. Flooding also led to the evacuation of three area nursing homes, affecting more than 250 patients, Dean said. Opryland Hotel expected to lose power Sunday night and staffers planned to ask their guests to evacuate, according to Janel Lacey, a spokeswoman for the Nashville mayor's office. While some streams around Nashville were starting to recede on Sunday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was planning to release dammed upstream water Sunday night, which could cause more flooding around Nashville, city emergency management chief Stephen Halford said. The water needed to be released to keep the Army Corps equipment safe, Halford said. The National Weather Service issued a civil emergency message Sunday to central and western Tennessee, telling people to stay off roads because too many are closed and people are getting stranded. The weather service also issued a flood emergency Sunday for much of central Kentucky -- where tens of thousands were trying to get home after this weekend's Kentucky Derby -- and in south central Indiana. In Louisville, Kentucky, the National Turnpike and Gene Snyder Freeway were closed on Sunday. In addition to flooding fatalities, one Tennessean died over the weekend in a tornado in Hardeman County, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said Sunday. The mayor's Office of Emergency Management in Nashville announced Sunday night that it had confirmed five fatalities in Davidson County -- which encompasses Nashville -- thought to be flood-related.","NEW:  Bodies recovered from a flooded house and an upside down vehicle on a flooded road .

"New York (CNN) -- A Picasso painting fetched nearly $106.5 million at auction Tuesday, a record for any single work of art, Christie's New York said. ""Nude, Green Leaves and Bust"" sold for $106,482,500 to an unidentified telephone bidder, the auction house said in a news release. ""Silence fell over the packed saleroom as Christopher Burge conducted nine minutes of bidding that involved eight clients,"" it said. ""Christie's lead auctioneer took bids from a client in the saleroom as well as those on the phone before the competition settled down to two bidders at the $88 million mark and a one-on-one battle ensued. The final bid was hammered down at 7.32 p.m. at $95 million."" The buyer's premium -- the additional fee paid to the auction house -- took the price of the painting to $106.5 million. ""Nude, Green Leaves and Bust,"" or ""Nu au Plateau de Sculpteur,"" is from the collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody, who died last November and was the wife of the real estate developer Sidney F. Brody. The collection, amassed primarily during the 1940s and 1950s, had been in the family's home since. Experts had referred to the 1932 work as ""lost"" because it had never been published in color. It shows Picasso's muse and mistress, Marie-Therese Walter. The previous highest price for a work at auction was $104,327,006 paid for ""L'Homme Qui Marche I, bronze"" (Walking Man 1), 1960, by Alberto Giacometti. It sold during an auction at Sotheby's to an anonymous telephone bidder in February, 2010.

"(CNN)  -- A month after announcing plans to expand offshore drilling, President Obama visited ground zero of the Gulf Coast oil disaster and warned that residents could be facing a ""potentially unprecedented environmental disaster."" ""The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf states and it could extend for a long time. It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home,"" Obama said Sunday in Venice, Louisiana. The president reiterated that oil company BP is responsible for the leak and will foot the cost of the cleanup.  He pledged to ""spare no effort to respond to this crisis for as long as it continues."" Obama's remarks were a stark contrast from his late March proposal to open swaths of U.S. coastal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico to oil and natural gas drilling. Obama said then that the decision did not come lightly, but it was one that he approached with confidence. ""The bottom line is this: Given our energy needs, in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs, and keep our businesses competitive, we are going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable, homegrown energy,"" he said as he unveiled his plans. Obama said the federal government would begin the process of leasing some areas off the coasts of Virginia, Alaska and possibly Florida to oil companies for drilling. New offshore drilling in most U.S. waters has been banned since the early 1980s, when mounting public pressure pushed lawmakers into action. A disastrous oil spill off the California coast in 1969 sparked protests that grew into a broader environmental movement, which eventually forced a drilling moratorium. But as the environmental impact of the Gulf Coast spill comes ashore, the appetite for Obama's offshore drilling plan and the enthusiasm from administration officials appear to have subsided. CNNMoney: Oil spill may threaten offshore drilling plans . ""All he has said is that he's not going to continue the moratorium on drilling,"" White House senior adviser David Axelrod told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Friday. ""No domestic drilling in new areas is going to go forward until there is an adequate review of what's happened here and of what is being proposed elsewhere."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that moving ahead on offshore drilling is ""going to require a balancing act."" ""That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills,"" she said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Sunday that the Gulf Coast disaster ""sends out the clarion call that we need to diversify our energy resources."" ""Our intention is to move forward thoughtfully, looking at how we can protect the resources of the United States and making thoughtful decisions,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" noting that deep-water drilling has been done thousands of times without incident. Time.com: Obama promises help, but containing spill is still talk . Obama said Friday he still believes that domestic oil production is an important part of the strategy for energy security, but he added, ""I've always said it must be done responsibly, for the safety of our workers and our environment."" The president ordered Salazar to conduct a review of the oil spill and report back in 30 days on what precautions, if any, should be required to prevent future accidents. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida has asked Obama to shelve his proposal, at least until the cause of the current spill is fully investigated. In a letter to the president, Nelson also said he would file legislation ""that would, for the time being, prohibit the Interior Department from acting on your administration's plans to expand offshore drilling, including seismic testing and other exploratory operations."" Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who in the past has been a proponent of offshore drilling, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that such drilling has ""got to be tabled, for sure."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs indicated last week that Obama's offshore plans aren't set in stone. ""I think our focus right now is, one, the area, the spill, and two, also to ultimately determine the cause of it and see the impact that that ultimately may or may not have,"" he said, noting that Obama's announcement was the beginning, and not the end, of a longer process.

"(CNN) -- Actress Lynn Redgrave died Sunday after a seven-year battle with breast cancer, according to her family. Redgrave, 67, was surrounded by her children at her Connecticut home when she died, the family said in a statement Monday morning. The star of stage, film and television was twice nominated for an Academy Award: for best actress in 1966 for her role in ""Georgy Girl"" and for best supporting actress in the 1998 film ""Gods and Monsters."" ""She lived, loved and worked harder than ever before,"" the family said. ""The endless memories she created as a mother, grandmother, writer, actor and friend will sustain us for the rest of our lives. Our entire family asks for privacy through this difficult time,"" the statement said. Redgrave is from ""a family of actors, embracing as it does more than five generations,"" she wrote on her official website. She is the younger sister of Oscar-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave and the aunt of the late actress Natasha Richardson. Her parents, Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, were British stage and film actors. Her paternal grandparents, Roy Redgrave and Margaret Scudamore, were stage and silent film actors. Redgrave teamed with daughter Annabel Clark in 2004 to produce the book ""Journal: A Mother and Daughter's Recovery from Breast Cancer."" ""I thought I was living very fully before this happened,"" she said in 2005. ""But in comparison, no, I really wasn't. I wasn't taking the time to notice things. I didn't see things as brightly or as sharply or as memorably as I do now. ""I really don't let a moment slide by. I just don't. It's a big price to pay, isn't it, to have to have cancer to learn that? But it is in the end, I have to say, a price worth paying,"" Redgrave said. Redgrave's professional acting debut was in 1962 at London's Royal Court Theatre in a production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" A year later, she was invited to join Britain's National Theatre for its inaugural season under the direction of Sir Laurence Olivier, according to her personal biography. Her first film performance came in ""Tom Jones,"" a 1963 movie co-starring Albert Finney and her mother. Redgrave's ""Georgy Girl"" role three years later, opposite James Mason, earned her a best actress Golden Globe and the Academy Award best actress nomination. Her portrayal of a wisecracking young woman was a box office hit. Other early film roles included ""The National Health,"" ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex,"" ""The Happy Hooker"" and ""Getting It Right."" Redgrave enjoyed a revitalized film career late in life. She won a second Golden Globe and her second Oscar nomination for her comedic role in ""Gods and Monsters."" She continued to make movies despite her illness, including her last film role in ""Confessions of a Shopaholic,"" which hit theaters a year ago. Redgrave debuted on Broadway in 1967 in ""Black Comedy."" The first of three Tony nominations came in 1976 for ""Mrs. Warren's Profession."" She was nominated again for her Broadway roles in ""Shakespeare for My Father"" in 1993 and ""The Constant Wife"" in 2005.

"(CNN)  -- I spent a restless night, worrying that another man-made disaster might devastate my beloved hometown, New Orleans, just as its post-Katrina motto ""Recover, Rebuild, Rebirth"" was becoming real. The oil spill couldn't come at a worse time. Everybody was so up, waiting for the inauguration of our newly elected Mayor Mitch Landrieu. The BP oil spill threatens New Orleans and the entire Gulf Coast in a way that's more insidious than Hurricane Katrina. After all, the failure of the levees and the response from the previous administration, widely criticized for incompetence and indifference, followed an act of nature: the destruction, immediate; the impact, obvious; and the pain and suffering, visible to all. The BP disaster has only one cause: human greed, and the almost inevitable result, negligence. The immediate tragedy was that 11 people died. But the destruction that will result from BP's ""crude river"" will be long-term and the impact far from obvious. The ""crude river"" will spawn streams of suffering: economic, environmental and emotional. So as the ""Big Muddy"" fights the ""Big Cruddy,"" how do we assess the players? And what actions should be taken against rigged disasters, both once and future? First, we must hold BP accountable and responsible. Was it an accident? Only if we define ""accident"" as negligence. The failure of the ""shear ram,"" the set of steel blades intended to slash through a pipe at the top of a well and close off the flow of crude, should not have surprised BP or the corporations that work for it. Eight years ago, the Minerals Management Service found that 50 percent of the shear rams tested failed. So calling the failure of the ""last resort device"" an accident is like calling the damage caused by a drunken driver an accident. Failure to take the proper precautions is not an accident; it's negligence. BP has rightly accepted responsibility. We may grant the company a skeptical benefit of the doubt regarding its willingness to pay for the cleanup and the damages. We should, however, monitor its PR-to-payout ratio. But we should not lose sight of the role of companies like Halliburton, under investigation because it was responsible for the cement seal that apparently leaked; Cameron International, which supplied the rig's blowout prevention system; or Transocean, which manufactured the rig. As the federal government begins its investigation, it should ask not only who was negligent, but why. To what extent did profit preclude prudence? Since BP can't contain the spill -- rather, the river, which is what it really is -- government at all levels must do what it's supposed to do, and do it right. For example, officials should carry out Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser's plan to deploy local fishermen with booms on movable platforms in the Gulf, ready to ""draw a line in the sand,"" depending on how the oil moves. Gov. Bobby Jindal has approved. Already the response from the Obama administration exceeds that of the federal response to Katrina, and the oil hasn't yet begun to cause the catastrophic damage we all fear. The morning after the explosion, Deputy Secretary of the Interior David J. Hayes was sent to the Gulf. The morning after the explosion, Deputy Secretary of the Interior David J. Hayes was sent to the Gulf. President Obama began monitoring the situation, staying in contact with the governors of the five Gulf states, making sure every available resource be at their disposal and ordering a coordinated Cabinet-level response. Here are a few authorizations the president has made, before his personal visit. • The U.S. Coast Guard; the Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce and Interior; and the Environmental Protection Agency immediately began directing and overseeing BP's response. • The Navy is using advanced technology and working with the Coast Guard to contain and disperse the oil. • The Departments of Homeland Security and Interior will be investigating the cause and inspecting all platforms and rigs in the Gulf. • The secretary of defense is authorizing the Louisiana National Guard to help communities in the cleanup and to protect critical habitats from contamination. But Obama has to let people know what's being done, what will be done, and that he takes this personally. He needs to express, perhaps as only he can, that the federal government gets it. He gets the plight of the fishermen, the restaurants, the waiters, the taxi drivers -- the economic ripple effect and the environmental tide of disaster. This is a visual and visceral crisis. If he handles it right, it will be known as a sign of Obama's competence. Obama can't split the sea, but he must help to plug the Gulf. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Oil spill comes as her hometown of New Orleans is on the mend .

"(CNET) -- The imagined inventions of Victorian-era French novelist Albert Robida may be coming closer to reality. Who, you ask? Robida was an illustrator and writer for popular science-fiction magazines, and is sometimes compared to Jules Verne. In his 1890 novel ""Le Vingtieme siecle. La vie electrique,"" he described something called a ""telephonoscope."" Since then, we've seen telephonoscopes -- basically videophones -- in everything from ""The Jetsons"" to ""Blade Runner."" What we haven't seen is the videophone in our living rooms. That may finally be changing. The common use of videophones could happen through three technologies that separately aren't exactly considered bleeding edge today: high-speed Internet, a television, and Skype. Samsung says it will put the VoIP calling service Skype as an application on its televisions, allowing phone calls to be made on camera right from a couch, just like Jane Jetson talking into her TV set. The Samsung Skype-enabled TV follows similar announcements from Panasonic and LG at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. The models will range from to $1,200 to $2,000 for Panasonic's set. Samsung and LG have not yet announced how much they will charge. The Skype on TV application should work similarly on all three models, which in turn should closely mimic the version of the application that many people use to make free PC to PC calls, or for a fee, PC to landline. Skype accounts are free to set up and can be activated using the TV's remote control right on the screen. The video calls will also be free, as will voice calls between Skype users. Using Skype to call traditional landline and mobile phones is a few cents per minute. Calls can be answered while watching a program, but it's not yet possible to both talk and continue to watch uninterrupted. By the time these models actually hit stores in late spring there should be three TV makers offering Skype on their TVs. And not just any three TV makers, but the world's largest overall (Samsung sells practically one of every five TVs sold), the leader in plasmas (Panasonic), and LG, which is close behind Samsung, selling 15 percent of all TVs. While Robida wrote about the idea, AT&T did the most to advance the idea from the pages of Victorian sci-fi to actuality. Unfortunately its 1960s videophone system, known as the Picturephone, was a bust. Few ever signed up for the service because you had to reserve call times and pay a whopping $16 per minute. The idea, however, was at least on the right track: making videophones accessible to normal folk. Today teleconferencing is a common tool for companies to put employees in different locations virtually, if not physically, in the same conference room. But the high cost of the fancy systems from companies like Cisco and Hewlett-Packard doesn't make them consumer-friendly. Cisco also announced at CES it would be offering a home version of its telepresence software sometime this year, and did not yet mention a price. Videophones for the home have never really caught on in the way they have at businesses. Even versions of the concept built into a corded telephone didn't really generate much excitement. Usually this was a small screen attached to a phone base station and conversations had to take place wherever the phone was plugged in, which tended to be places like a dresser or a kitchen counter. Video calls today can be made online. They're easy and cheap, and of course don't require the purchase of an pricey new TV. A computer with a built-in Webcam and a voice-over-IP service like Skype or a chat application like Yahoo Messenger usually suffice, but it is still an activity that's attached to a computer, and therefore going to be intimidating to people who either don't like or have trouble with technology. TVs are far more accessible though. Now with major companies like Samsung, Panasonic, and LG pushing the idea of the TV as videophone, the concept does at least have the chance to catch on. Consumer surveys show that people are beginning to buy Internet-connected TVs, which allow not just Skype calls, but also other activities on the TV that are normally confined to the computer. That includes accessing Internet radio and video streaming from services like Pandora and Netflix, and social sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. A survey of 800 U.S. consumers who bought TVs in January found that 27.5 percent of them have connected their new sets to the Internet, either through the TV itself or via an external device such as a game console or digital video box, according to iSuppli. And of those, almost 42 percent recently purchased a Web-connected TV. And Skype likely won't be a brand new concept to a lot of those new TV owners. Skype already has over 521 million registered accounts, so there's a built-in audience who is already signed up and knows how to use it. But the quality may not be what some people expect, says DisplaySearch analyst Paul Gagnon. ""Teleconferencing is inherently kind of a low-quality experience, especially in a consumer home. On a computer it works OK, but blown up to the size of the TV, I wasn't terribly impressed with some of the demos at CES,"" he said. And quality aside, even in terms of logistics, there's a lot to consider. Even with an Internet-connected TV, you still need a decent Internet connection, and for a two-way video call, you have to have people on the other end with the same set up. In other words, ""it's really early,"" Gagnon said. Time will tell if videophones are just a fad or about to become an integral part of the modern idea of the ""connected living room."" The tools are there, but it's entirely possible that people don't want to use their TVs like that. Either way, even if the latest incarnation of Robida's telephonoscope doesn't gain widespread acceptance, he still has a decent track record for his prognostications. Other things he predicted in the same 1890 novel? The use of submarines, helicopters, and biological warfare. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- President Obama said Sunday his administration has mounted a ""relentless response"" to the oil spill unleashed by the sinking of an offshore drill rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Obama met with local, state and federal officials involved in the cleanup in southeastern Louisiana, the closest stretch of coastline threatened by the massive spill. Afterward, he said that despite ""the most advanced technology available,"" the spill may not be stopped for many days. ""I'm not going to rest, and none of the gentlemen and women who are here are going to rest or be satisfied, until the leak is stopped at the source, the oil on the Gulf is contained and cleaned up and the people of this region are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods,"" he said. ""We will spare no resource to clean up whatever damage is caused."" Obama met with the commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. Thad Allen; EPA administrator Lisa Jackson; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; and the presidents of several parish governments after arriving, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. The president's briefing included an update on the procedures being attempted to cap the well and the economic and environmental impact of the spill, Gibbs said. After landing in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Sunday, Obama joined Jindal on a two-hour drive to Venice, a staging ground for efforts to fight the growing slick. Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Allen warned that the leaking oil from a rig explosion could continue for weeks with dire consequences. ""It potentially is catastrophic,"" Salazar said. ""I think we have to prepare for the worst."" That would mean oil damaging sensitive coastal wetlands and industries, including a vital fishing sector that was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Obama initially planned to fly over the affected area by helicopter, but weather conditions prevented the flight. Before his trip, Cabinet officials warned he would find a dire situation. Officials warn of possible catastrophe . Salazar blamed the explosion that caused the spill on a failure in rig technology intended to prevent so-called blowouts. ""There is no doubt at all here that what has happened is the blowout prevention mechanism at the bottom of the well ... is defective,"" Salazar said. ""While there have been blowouts in the past, we have never seen anything that has been quite of this magnitude."" The well is owned by oil company BP. Lamar McKay, president of BP America, told ABC's ""This Week"" that the company doesn't know why the blowout preventer failed. All three officials interviewed by CNN repeatedly emphasized that BP is legally responsible for spill and clean-up efforts. They avoided direct criticism of the company, but said BP must do more to try to cap the gushing well. Allen called the spill ""one of the most complex things we've ever dealt with,"" and said it was impossible so far to predict how much oil will eventually leak. ""If we lost a total well head, it could be 100,000 barrels or more a day,"" he said. BP said two Louisiana communities, Venice and Port Fourchon, will likely be the first places hit by the oil slick. Nearly 1 million feet of booms have been deployed in an effort to protect precious estuaries and wildlife, even as thousands of barrels of crude oil continued gushing into the water. Drilling new wells to stop the flow would take a month or two, and it was unclear if the leak could be contained or slowed before then. WDSU: Rush to save Lake Pontchartrain . McKay said the company is building a containment system to prevent the leaking oil from spreading, but it may take another six to eight days to deploy it. Meanwhile, the company is working to battle the slick offshore and to clean up any oil that reaches the coast. ""We're still working hard, still working hard on the blowout preventer and see if we can actuate this piece of evidently failed equipment,"" he said. But he compared that to ""doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot-controlled submarines."" Sen. Mary Landrieu and Rep. Charlie Melancon, both of Louisiana, said they want the government to put more pressure on BP to find a solution. ""Our government needs to get somewhere between 'drill, baby, drill' and 'spill, baby, spill,' "" Melancon said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Landrieu told the same program that the government should force BP to immediately start drilling remedial wells at the site ""and hope that one can fix this."" The slick has already taken a toll on life along the Gulf Coast, bringing fishing and tourism to a halt in many places and threatening to cripple those industries for weeks to come. ""I'm pretty much on pause right now. ... It's just a big waiting game,"" said David Boola, a fisherman who operates boat trips for tourists out of Venice. WDSU: Oil spill causes empty shrimp nets . Allen noted BP was deploying its top technology such as the remote operation vehicles, which the government doesn't have. At the same time, Napolitano and Salazar said the Obama administration had reacted quickly to what they called an escalating situation. Napolitano noted the incident was first an explosion and fire, with a search-and-rescue effort for missing rig workers. It then worsened when the rig sank two days later, followed by the increasing oil leak, she said. While BP was the first responder, the Coast Guard reacted right away to the situation and deployed 70 vessels and 1 million feet of boom for possible service, Napolitano said. Salazar noted that the Obama administration has ordered inspections of ""blowout preventers"" on other Gulf rigs. The government's job was to ""keep the boot on the neck"" of BP to ensure it meets its obligations in stopping the spill, dealing with the oil slick and paying for all costs and damages. Also on the CNN program Sunday, Florida's Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio called the oil slick a ""crisis"" but withheld judgment on the administration's response. According to Rubio, it appeared that much of the early information provided to the federal government by BP had been ""either inaccurate or shortcoming."" In recent days, Rubio said, ""We've seen the administration move aggressively, and I hope aggressively enough."" BP partnered with government officials to hold town hall meetings throughout the region Saturday to respond to concerns about the spill's consequences. But Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal suggested the response to the oil slick has so far been inadequate. ""We continue to be concerned with BP's ability to respond to this incident,"" he said. Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the oil leak could cause damage that would last decades. ""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" Charter said. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ""You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area,"" he said. ""Ultimately, this will have a multidecade impact."" The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on the BP contractor Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform. Eleven oil-rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana, and the untapped wellhead is gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said Saturday.","NEW: President Obama briefed on procedures used to cap well, impact of the spill .

"Livingston, Wisconsin (CNN) -- It's the end of the day in rural southwest Wisconsin, and the Trocke family wanders through a ditch along a county road, their eyes fixed on the earth. Dan and Laurie Trocke, and their three kids, are on a mission for fragments of rock that came from about as far away as one can imagine. ""We're not finding a lot, but that's beside the point really,"" Laurie Trocke says.  ""We're not professionals. It's purely for fun."" It all began the evening of April 14, when what looked like a giant fireball came crashing through the atmosphere. ""It just lit up the whole sky,"" she says. ""You thought it was thunder and lightning, but it just kept going and going and going."" ""It really didn't sound natural,"" Dan Trocke adds. What they were witnessing was a meteor -- and a pretty spectacular one at that. Watch the video . Michael Farmer, whom the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois, calls the ""world's top meteorite hunter,"" said that as soon as he saw video of the display, he hopped a flight to Wisconsin. ""Most of them don't make a light show or a sound show,"" Farmer said. ""When this one came in, the energy released was like nuclear bomb-type energy. ... [I knew] there would be thousands of pieces on the ground."" By definition, those pieces are what scientists call meteorites: the remnants of the meteor that don't burn up along the journey and instead make it all the way to the ground. Farmer headed to the sleepy Wisconsin village of Livingston, which was about to become ground zero for the latest meteorite hunt. Livingston, with a population of 597, was the town nearest to where the otherworldly bits were turning up. Soon, everyone wanted a piece of the action -- from internationally known experts to the locals, like 7-year-old Jackson McCluskey. Jackson, along with dozens of other students at Iowa Grant Elementary School in Livingston, learned about the meteors from geologists and meteorite-hunting experts at a school assembly.  Later that day, the kids combed the school grounds for meteorites during recess. McCluskey found a rock that one of the experts confirmed was a meteorite, weighing 35 grams.  He sold it to a collector, but they wouldn't say for how much. On average, prices for pieces of this particular space rock have been set at about $10 to $20 per gram, according to Farmer. He added that a meteorite's worth can vary, depending on the amount of buzz surrounding an event and how much media attention has been devoted to it. It's easy to compare it all to a mini gold rush. Most folks aren't hunting with the mere hopes of winning bragging rights.  Brian Nodolf, who lives on a farm near Livingston, said his wife found a meteorite weighing about 100 grams. ""I'm told it's worth maybe a thousand dollars,"" Nodolf said. So far, about two dozen pieces had been found, one expert hunter said.  But there's no way of knowing for sure, since many don't announce it when they do find one. But what do the residents think about the influx of people to their small town? They've welcomed them with open arms -- primarily because it's a boost to the economy. Who needs a government stimulus when you've got money falling from the sky? ""We've gotten business we never would have had,"" said Tom Brown, village president. ""I mean, who was going to come to Livingston? It's off the map."" Tim Loeffelholz, owner of The Friendly Place, a local gas station and convenience store, says business is up by about 30 percent since folks started finding meteorites. ""It's what we needed, a little boost,"" Loeffelholz said. ""It's been great for the town, great for the whole area."" His store has become a pseudo-trading post, where people looking for or wanting to sell meteorites have put their contact information on signs along the counter. If and when the Trocke family gets their hands on a meteorite, they say it won't be from a want ad. They'll do it all on their own. As 11- year-old Connor put it, ""It's a sense of pride to find one.""","Livingston, Wisconsin, is the town nearest to the April 14 meteor strike .

"(CNN)  -- Her adopted brood included a Russian immigrant who had lost an eye to cancer and a family whose father was killed by a suicide bomber on a bus. Clara Chaya Hammer, a Jerusalem great, great-grandmother who endeared herself to thousands by making sure the city's needy received a proper meal on the Jewish Sabbath, died in March just shy of her 100th birthday. Known around the world as ""The Chicken Lady of Jerusalem,"" Hammer spearheaded a fund that provided free chicken to her charges every week -- or a substitute, if they happened to be vegetarian. She once quipped, ""Just because they're vegetarian, I don't have to punish them."" One of Hammer's daughters and great-granddaughters will carry on ""The Chicken Lady's"" legacy. ""We decided in the family we have to continue what she started 30 years ago,"" said daughter Chana Homnick in Jerusalem. ""We're continuing the Clara Hammer Chicken Fund to feed over 250 families."" The monthly butcher bill tallies about $10,000. Hammer, a widow and retired Hebrew teacher, made it her job to give the neighborhood butcher plenty of business. It all began when she stood in line at the butcher shop to buy chicken for the Sabbath herself. She noticed a young girl in front of her receiving a plastic bag full of chicken fat and skin. Curious, she asked the butcher: ""How many cats or dogs does that family have?"" He explained the family had many children and the father was on dialysis. They had run up a tremendous bill, so the butcher just gave them fat and skins for a soup for Friday dinner and a cholent, or stew, for Saturday lunch. Hammer declared: ""You give them every week two chickens and a half kilo of turkey, and I will pay for it."" Soon the butcher, rabbis, social workers and friends began telling her of other families who needed help, and the fund grew. At first, Hammer's family helped her foot the bill. Then the cause took wing, with donors from around the world sending money. All received a handwritten thank-you card from Hammer and a copy of an article about the effort. For nearly 30 years, Hammer single-handedly ran the operation from her dining-room table. She would have been 100 on May 19. Born in Russia in 1910, she survived a pogrom in the Ukraine and fled with her family to Romania. Enduring hunger, illness and imprisonment, they made their way to Palestine and lived in a tent for three years. With no hospital care available, they were advised to leave for the United States. Her mother, who had contracted tuberculosis, died two years later, when Hammer was 14. Decades later in Israel, Hammer reflected: ""I have a tremendous amount of sympathy, what we would call 'rahmanut,' for people who are hungry, thirsty, in pain, have any type of needs."" Among her many awards were an honorary ""doctorate in kindness"" from Yeshiva University at age 98 and the Jerusalem Prize for Good Citizenship at age 90. ""My mother did so many wonderful things for so many people. Instead of being called 'The Chicken Lady,' she should be called 'The Mitzvah Lady.' The main thing is she wanted everyone to feel good. She was very special,"" said Homnick, one of Hammer's three daughters. Other survivors include nine grandchildren, 35 great-grandchildren and 24 great, great-grandchildren. Ralph Resnick, a nephew in Los Angeles, California, remembers Hammer as a larger-than-life personality. ""I think the ripples of her mitzvah, of her good deed, have emanated far and wide. It's a wonderful lesson of how something like that can start and influence so many people -- and not just the people she helped. It's almost like 'Pay It Forward.' It really happens in real life too.

"(CNN) -- Governments and charities have spent billions to try to wipe out poverty, but award-winning economist Esther Duflo says we really don't know if that money has been well spent. But as a result of Duflo's pioneering work, we may be getting some answers to that question. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor has led the way in showing how the scientific method can be applied to determining what policies actually work. Duflo last month won the John Bates Clark Medal, which is awarded to an American economist under the age of 40 who has made the ""most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge."" In her talk at the TED2010 conference in Long Beach, California, Duflo pointed out that Africa has received a great amount of development aid, but the African economies have not made a lot of progress in improving their gross domestic product. ""If we don't know whether we are doing any good, we are not any better than the medieval doctors and their leeches. Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies. Is it the leeches? Is it something else? We don't know."" Read more about Esther Duflo on TED.com . In three areas, Duflo said her research techniques can help answer vital questions: . • Giving away bed nets treated with insecticide to prevent the spread of malaria works, despite fears by some that free nets would not be valued by recipients and might be used instead as fishing nets. • If you want to enhance the effectiveness of the educational system in a developing country, you can sometimes have a great impact by indirect means. For example, if the nation is one where children suffer from intestinal worms, spending $100 on deworming the children can be many times more effective in getting them educated than simply spending the $100 on paying for teachers, school meals and other school expenses. • In the Indian state of Rajasthan, Duflo found that by creating a monthly camp and giving away kilo-sized bags of lentils, there was a significant increase in the number of parents who brought their children to be immunized with potentially life-saving vaccines. Duflo said, ""It's not the Middle Ages anymore. It's the 21st century. And in the 20th century, randomized, controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don't work. And you can do the same randomized, controlled trial for social policy. You can put social innovation to the same rigorous, scientific tests that we use for drugs.""","Esther Duflo: We don't know if billions in aid to fight poverty actually worked .

"Washington (CNN) -- It was my first chance to spend some quality time at dinner with First Lady Michelle Obama, so I decided to do what my pal Ali Velshi would probably do in the same situation: get her hooked on Twitter. I was sitting with the first lady and Jay Leno at the head table for Saturday night's White House Correspondents Association Dinner because I'm a member of the association's board, a front-row seat to the slew of celebrities who walked up to gawk at Mrs. Obama and the president, who was a few seats from me. Teen sensation Justin Beiber, famous-for-being-famous Kim Kardashian, comedian Chevy Chase and actor Morgan Freeman all walked up to the rope line separating the head table from the rest of the ballroom to send the first couple a shout-out. I was snapping pics of the celebrity parade on my iPhone and posting them to my Twitter account, @edhenrycnn, during dessert, just a few minutes before the president and Leno would take their turns at telling some jokes. Leno, a social media skeptic, finally turned to me with squinted eyes and said in a conspiratorial tone, ""Are you tweeting right now?"" I confessed to Leno that I was, sparking Mrs. Obama to ask me whether journalists find value in social media or whether it's mostly trivial. I said I find it helpful to get feedback, good and bad, from people who follow my tweets. When Mrs. Obama mentioned that she had never tweeted, I noted that the president had sent out his first tweet a few months ago from a Red Cross account to promote relief to Haiti and wondered aloud: ""Why don't you send out your first tweet on my iPhone?"" The first lady laughed and said her press staff wouldn't be happy if she went rogue like that. Besides, she said, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs would have to sign off first. Noting that Gibbs was sitting at the other end of the head table, I stood and told the first lady I'd ask him. To my surprise, Gibbs instantly told me it was a fun idea, on one condition: I had to first send out a tweet saying he had endorsed it, so that colleagues on Mrs. Obama's staff were not blindsided. I typed out a tweet saying, ""i am trying to coax First Lady to do her first ever tweet. Gibbs @presssec just gave his blessing."" Then I walked back to Mrs. Obama to tell her the good news. But she told me good-naturedly, ""Gibbs did not say that; you're lying!"" I assured the first lady I would not tell her a fib, which prompted Leno to jump to his feet to say he'd go get Gibbs to sort this out once and for all. A laughing Gibbs came over and advised the first lady it would be a harmless exercise, but she was skeptical until the commander in chief finally weighed in. Hearing the light-hearted argument playing out a few seats down, the president asked, ""What's going on?"" The first lady explained her dilemma, but the president waved his hand as if to say ""no big deal"" and told her to go for it. I handed the first lady my iPhone, but it quickly became apparent that she had very little experiences with this smartphone. Like many people, she said, ""How do you type on this?"" Gibbs, who was looking over our shoulders, suggested that I type it out, so I told Mrs. Obama to start dictating the note. I started my typing ""from flotus,"" as in ""first lady of the United States."" She joked about the pressure of coming up with something interesting to say. She started simply with how she was at the dinner and dictated, ""this is officially my first Twitter"" and added her thoughts about the comedy acts about to perform. I knew Mrs. Obama should have called it her first ""tweet,"" but I didn't want to be in the uncomfortable position of correcting the first lady -- my mom would be appalled -- and sounding like a tech know-it-all. She asked Gibbs for his opinion on what she had dictated, and he said the proper way to say it was that it was her first tweet. Mrs. Obama grilled me on whether Gibbs was right, and I said he was but I didn't want to be the one changing her words, so she politely asked me to change it so that she sounded as hip as possible. The final version, for the history books: ""from flotus: 'here at dinner this is officially my first Tweet. i am looking forward to some good laughs from the potus and jay'"". Some of my followers were particularly amused that Mrs. Obama referred to her husband as ""the potus"" -- as in the president of the United States -- and started re-tweeting it. It also got me a few more followers, which brings me back to Ali Velshi.

I bet it will be a smart way for her to push her initiatives, just as former first lady Laura Bush now has a Twitter account to help sell her memoirs and talk up her pet causes, too.

"(CNN) -- A Maryland funeral home has lost its license after investigators found about 40 bodies stacked on top of each other, leaking fluid, in a garage, a state official said. The state Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors revoked the license of Chambers Funeral Home & Crematorium in Riverdale, Maryland after an April 26 visit to the site. Hari Close, president of the the state funeral board, told CNN Tuesday that some of the bodies were cadavers who had been donated to a local university for research. Other bodies came from other funeral homes, Close said. The bodies were supposed to be cremated, but investigators were alarmed at how they were stored in the garage while they awaited cremation. ""Even somebody who donates their body to science, they still should be treated with dignity,"" said Close. ""Not to mention the health and safety issues with the body fluids flowing out."" William Chambers, co-owner of the funeral home, told CNN-affiliate WJLA said that he hopes to work with the state to resolve the alleged violations. When investigators inspected the funeral home they were warned by an employee, who told them, ""Don't get upset about all the bodies in there,"" according to documents released by the state funeral board. Inside the room was a ""large pile, approximately 12 by 12 feet, of body bags containing human remains strewn on the floor of the garage in front of a removal van. There was visible leakage from the body bags as well as a pungent odor,"" the documents said. ""The investigator also observed writing on some of the body bags,"" they said. ""However, fluid leakage from the body bags caused the writing to smear and become illegible. As a result, it was not immediately possible to determine the identity of the remains."" There will be a hearing at the end of the month to determine whether the funeral home will get its license back, Close said. CNN's Patty Lane contributed to this report.","Investigators found about 40 bodies stacked atop each other awaiting cremation .

"Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Ben Stone knows quite a bit about disasters. Five years ago, a 28-foot storm surge from Hurricane Katrina flattened his house and almost wiped out his hometown of Gulfport, Mississippi. Now, if a rapidly growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico comes ashore -- as some expect -- Stone will be able to see it from the front porch of his newly-built house. ""You can get mad about this,"" he said. ""I'm very disturbed about it."" Like residents along the coast of Alabama and Florida Panhandle, it is a waiting game for Gulfport. Already a heavy smell of oil hung over the Mississippi beaches. ""This could not have happened at a worse time in our history,"" said John Kelly, the town's chief administrative officer. The city has undertaken half a billion dollars in new construction since Katrina. Of that, $30 million is being spent on developing the harbor -- the third largest container port on the Gulf Coast. ""Well, it if it threatens the commercial sea lanes, that's a concern because if ships don't come in and ships aren't able to go out, that stops commerce,"" said Donald Allee, the CEO of Mississippi State Port Authority. Equipment operator Daniel Schepens knows all too well what that will mean. After Katrina, he was out of work for a month. He is worried the fallout from the spill could be worse. ""No ships, the warehouses are empty, no trucks, no imports, no exports,"" he said. Federal officials closed a portion of the northern Gulf of Mexico to fishing Sunday, curtailing a billion-dollar business as high winds and choppy seas hampered efforts to corral a rapidly growing oil spill. The spill cast a pall over the annual Blessing of the Fleet in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, one of many towns that make their living from the Gulf. Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana attended a boat blessing in St. Bernard, Louisiana, where fishermen have observed the tradition for decades to usher in the shrimp season. ""Louisianians are resilient and understand that in times like these, it is our traditions that tie us closer together and provide the strength we need to face the challenges ahead,"" he said. ""This tragic oil spill has reminded everyone about the valuable connection between our residents and our wildlife, fisheries and coastline."" In Venice, Louisiana, a rain-spattered President Obama told reporters his administration has launched a ""relentless response"" to the spill, but said the problem might not be solved for ""many days."" A ruptured undersea well off Louisiana is spewing about 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico, and efforts to shut off the flow have been unsuccessful since the late April explosion that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon. The leading edge of the slick has grown closer to the coast of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Adm. Thad Allen, the commandant of the Coast Guard, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the slick was still nine miles off the Louisiana coast, but seas of 6 to 10 feet have made deploying booms to fend the spill off the coast ""somewhat problematic."" Oil giant BP, which owns the well at the heart of the problem, said it had prepared massive boxes to be lowered over the leak points, but deploying them would take about a week. The minimum 10-day fishing restriction imposed Sunday by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration covers an area between the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to the waters off Florida's Pensacola Bay. ""Balancing economic and health concerns, this order closes just those areas that are affected by oil,"" NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a statement announcing the decision. ""There should be no health risk in seafood currently in the marketplace."" The Gulf Coast's commercial fishing industry brings in about $2.4 billion to the region. Thomas Rodi, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Mobile, officiated at Sunday's event in Bayou La Batre and said the spill could have ""widespread effects"" on the area -- ""not only the livelihood of people, but an entire way of life."" Among those taking part in the blessing was Maurice Ryan, who said, ""You have to put your trust in someone."" ""I really feel like, with the church and the bishop, I've got my life in good hands,"" Ryan said. ""BP certainly isn't helping me."" The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on BP contractor Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that left 11 men presumed dead. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said. ""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" said Richard Charter of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective."" The spill will have ""a multidecade impact"" -- a ""long-term poisoning"" of the area, he said. Booms were strung across the mouths of delta estuaries in Louisiana and inlets along the Mississippi coast. In Alabama, National Guard troops helped lay them out off Dauphin Island, at the southern end of Mobile Bay. In Pascagoula, Mississippi, a steady stream of customers stocked up on bags of freshly boiled crawfish, oysters and shrimp. The weekend trade was good, but owner Keith Delcambre said he was worried about the future if the oil slick hits the coast. ""All I know is seafood,"" he said while sorting crawfish in a small workroom behind the kitchen. ""I don't know what we'll do if this hits. It feels like a hurricane is coming, but what can you do to stop oil?"" The cause of the blast on the Deepwater Horizon remains unknown. BP says a device known as a ""blowout preventer"" failed and has not responded to repeated attempts to activate it using remotely operated submarines. Frustration with BP was growing across the Gulf states, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said the company's response has been inadequate. But BP America's president, Lamar McKay, told ABC's ""This Week"" that its focus ""is dealing with the source of the oil, dealing with it on the surface, and dealing with it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs."" McKay said the company has built a containment system to prevent the leaking oil from spreading. But it may take another six to eight days to deploy that system, which is made up primarily of massive boxes designed to capture the crude. BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said the company is trying to use remote-controlled submarines to shut off the well at the ocean floor, about 5,000 feet below the surface, and spreading dispersants on and under the water to break up the slick. The company has put out about 300,000 feet -- roughly 60 miles -- of floating booms to keep the oil away from ecologically sensitive shorelines, she said. But she said efforts to skim oil off the surface were put off because of bad weather. ""We're hampered because the weather is so bad. Some of the vessels can't get out,"" she said. ""So that slows us down a little bit. But they are still making the effort. We did get some photos back this morning that showed quite a bit of success."" CNN's David Mattingly, Brian Todd, Sarah Hoye, Mark Biello and Richard Lui contributed to this report.","Heavy smell of oil already hangs over Mississippi beaches .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United returned to the top of the English Premier League with a 3-1 victory over in-form Tottenham on Saturday but the champions' title hopes suffered a blow with the news that top scorer Wayne Rooney may miss the rest of the season. The England striker sat out the home win, which put United two points clear of Chelsea, with a groin injury suffered in training and he may miss the final two matches of the season. England coach Fabio Capello will be hoping that United take no risks with the 34-goal forward, who will be one of his key players at the World Cup in South Africa starting in mid-June. ""I think he'll probably take two to three weeks to recover,"" United manager Alex Ferguson told match broadcaster Sky. ""We'll try to get him back, he'll obviously be desperate to get back himself. We'll just have to wait and see."" Earlier this month, Rooney made a sooner-than-expected return from an ankle injury to play in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against Bayern Munich, then missed the 0-0 draw with Blackburn before a below-par outing in the 1-0 win over Manchester City that kept his side in the title race. United face mid-table Sunderland and Stoke in the climax to the season as the club seek a fourth successive league crown, while Chelsea hosts Stoke on Sunday before a trip to Liverpool and a home clash with lowly Wigan. Tottenham, who upset third-placed Arsenal and Chelsea in the two preceding matches, have not beaten United since 1989 and have not defeated one of the ""big four"" away from home in 66 matches. Harry Redknapp's team still retained fourth place in the table as Manchester City drew 0-0 at Arsenal in Saturday's late match. The Londoners looked like matching United at Old Trafford when defender Ledley King equalized in the 70th minute, but Portugal midfielder Nani snatched victory for the hosts with a delightful chip on 81 and then won a penalty for Ryan Giggs' second spot-kick of the game five minutes later. The 36-year-old Giggs had never scored a penalty in his near 600-game career for United, but coolly took over Rooney's duties in the 58th minute after Benoit Assou-Akotto brought down Patrice Evra in the box. United lost Evra to the lingering effects of his pre-match illness and winger Antonio Valencia went off with injury, while Spurs rallied with the return of England midfielder Aaron Lennon from long-term injury as a substitute. Defender King headed in Gareth Bale's corner as United fullback Rafael strayed from his position on the post and could not clear the ball to give the visitors hope of a point. But Nani raced onto substitute Federico Macheda's pass to beat goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes with an exquisite finish, and the Brazilian was again beaten by Giggs after a clumsy challenge from behind by Wilson Palacios. Manchester City trail Tottenham by a point in the battle for the fourth Champions League place, with the two teams to meet in their penultimate game of the season on May 5. City boss Roberto Mancini surprisingly left Emmanuel Adebayor on the bench after the Togo striker's ill-advised goal celebrations in front of his former club's fans when the teams last met in the league in September. Adebayor made an impact when he came on in the second half, but the match was most notable for a season-ending shoulder injury suffered by City's Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given that allowed Gunnar Nielsen to become the first Faroe Isander to play in the Premier League. The 23-year-old was largely untested as Arsenal's faint title hopes were finally extinguished, with the Londoners now seven points behind United with two matches left. Nielsen may have to fill in for the rest of the season, with Given's deputy Stuart Taylor injured and England international Joe Hart on loan at Birmingham. City next take on sixth-placed Aston Villa, who can keep their own Champions League hopes alive with victory at home to Midlands rivals Birmingham on Sunday. West Ham moved six points clear of the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over fellow strugglers Wigan that keeps Gianfranco Zola's team in the top flight for another season. Captain Scott Parker struck a 77th-minute winner from long range as West Ham recovered from an early own-goal by United States defender Jonathan Spector, with Brazilian striker Ilan and Czech midfielder Radoslav Kovac putting the London side 2-1 up at halftime. Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega leveled seven minutes after the interval with a bundled effort as Victor Moses flicked on a cross from first-goal provider Ben Watson, but Kovac headed against the bar before midfielder Parker celebrated his return from suspension with a fine winner. The result sent third-bottom Hull down to the second division after the Yorkshire side lost 1-0 in an ill-tempered home clash with Sunderland that saw both teams reduced to 10 men. Darren Bent put Sunderland ahead in the seventh minute from close range after strike partner Kenwyne Jones headed Alan Hutton's cross into his path for the England World Cup hopeful's 25th goal this season. Hull should have leveled after the club's former defender Michael Tuner brought down Geovanni, but Jimmy Bullard hit the post with his penalty attempt. Hutton was sent off just before halftime following an ugly exchange with Hull striker Jozy Altidore, which saw the Scot receive a headbutt after throwing the ball in the face of the United States international, who was also red-carded. Wolverhampton Wanderers will be safe for a second season in the Premier League if fellow promoted side Burnley fail to beat Liverpool on Sunday, having moved eight points clear of the second-bottom side with a 1-1 draw at home to Blackburn. Blackburn captain Ryan Nelsen put the visitors ahead in the 28th minute, with the New Zealand defender diverting in Morten Gamst Pedersen's corner, but substitute Sylvain Ebanks-Blake headed an 81st minute equalizer from Stephen Ward's cross. Relegated bottom club Portsmouth came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Bolton, as Ivory Coast striker Aruna Dindane netted a second-half double for the FA Cup finalists to cancel out first-half efforts by Kevin Davies and Ivan Klasnic.","Manchester United return to top of English Premier League with 3-1 win over Tottenham .

"Washington (CNN) -- White House advisers are considering recommending alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed be tried in a military court instead of a civilian one in New York City, a senior administration official told CNN on Friday. In November, Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to try Mohammed in a New York civilian court. ""I am confident in the ability of our courts to provide these defendants a fair trial, just as they have for over 200 years,"" Holder said last month. ""The alleged 9/11 conspirators will stand trial in our justice system before an impartial jury under long-established rules and procedures."" A firestorm of opposition erupted from both New York officials and top Republicans after Holder's announcement. New York police have estimated the cost to the city would exceed $200 million per year in a trial that could last years. They have said, among other things, that they would need to install more than 2,000 checkpoints in Lower Manhattan. Also, some congressional leaders have argued Mohammed should not be entitled to all the protections and privileges a defendant receives in civilian court. Last month, several lawmakers tied funding to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to holding a military trial for Mohammed and other suspected terrorists. To try Mohammed and others ""as common criminals, giving them the constitutional rights of American citizens in our courts, is justice according to 'Alice in Wonderland,'"" said Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut independent. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, argued that ""our military justice system is best able to protect the American people."" Holder said last month the Justice Department ""will have to take into account"" the views of other political leaders and residents. ""At the end of the day, wherever this case is tried, in whatever forum, what we have to ensure is that it's done as transparently as possible and with adherence to all the rules."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday the administration was evaluating its options ""based on New York City logistical and security concerns."" Gibbs and senior presidential adviser David Axelrod have said previously that President Obama believes the trial should take place in a criminal court instead of before a military tribunal. The senior administration official emphasized that no final recommendation has been given to the president and therefore no final decision regarding the 9/11 terror trial has been made. The official said administration advisers hope a decision will be made before the president leaves for an overseas trip on March 18. Progressive activists blasted the potential administration switch. ""If this stunning reversal comes to pass, President Obama will deal a death blow to his own Justice Department, not to mention American values,"" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""If the president flip-flops and retreats to the Bush military commissions, he will betray his campaign promise to restore the rule of law, demonstrate that his principles are up for grabs and lose all credibility with Americans who care about justice and the rule of law.""","Obama administration insisted 9/11 trial in New York would be symbol of U.S. rule of law .

"(CNN) -- They are everywhere, Haiti's precious and beautiful children. They make up more than a third of the country's 10 million-plus population. You see them on rooftops -- where there are rooftops -- flying kites. You see them gathered in small circles on the ground --where the ground is not muddy -- playing marbles. You see them skip around where the ground is muddy, sometimes bathing in water from manholes. You see them link hands and run in a circle while singing a song associated with the won, the Haitian equivalent of ""Ring Around the Rosie."" You see them fight for a turn at jumping rope. You see them twirl a bicycle wheel with a bent rope hanger and in that act you can see the dream of one day actually driving the rest of the bike, or a motorcycle, a car or an airplane. You see them carry gallons and buckets of water on tiny heads that have no place to rest. You see them suddenly appear in the middle of Port-au-Prince's impenetrable traffic and, dressed in dirty rags, plop an even dirtier rag on the hood of your car. You see them file in and out of the same traffic wearing striking school uniforms with different color plaid tops. Sometimes you see them wearing their Sunday best in the middle of the week. For more about CNN's ""Rescued"" documentary, read here . You see them packed into tents made of sticks and bedsheets -- and if they're lucky, tarp or plastic -- and some of them appear listless, their bloated bellies and reddened hair competing for your attention. If you say hello, some will answer you but they will avoid your gaze, both out of respect for you and shame at their condition. You see them stand in lines, backs straight even while the sun beats down on their heads and sweat rolls down their faces, as they wait for a bottle of water or a plate of food. You see them wobble on makeshift crutches for their newly amputated limbs even as they wince from pain that even some adults would find difficult to bear. Nevertheless they are children, Haiti's future. The January 12, 2010, earthquake changed their lives. Many watched loved ones die, lost family members and other caretakers, one or both of their parents, siblings. Many were stuck in the rubble of their homes and were rescued several days later. Yet in spite of everything, they dream, they laugh, they live, they love. Like most other children, they adore seeing their faces reflected in the back of a digital camera. ""Madame, Madame,"" they will say respectfully if they want to ask or tell you something. During such a conversation, I tell a little girl who is the same age as my eldest daughter, Mira, ""At home I have one exactly like you."" ""There is no one exactly like me,"" she replies. She's right. No child is exactly like any other, but all children want and need some basic things: food, shelter, safety, education, love. Ti moun se richès, says the Haitian proverb. Our children are our treasures. Some of them are diamonds in the rough. Some of them are brilliant, nearly illuminated beings. Now some are also scarred, both physically and psychologically. In one large tent city, I find the 7-year-old son of a man I knew growing up. The boy is in the camp with his mother while his father is in Miami, Florida, with his baby sister, whose hip was broken during the earthquake. ""I sleep during the day,"" he says, ""because the thieves come at night."" The child he plays with most often is an orphan who was taken in by a neighbor. After the earthquake, people kept asking me, ""Why don't we see Haitians adopting Haitian kids? Why is it always the blan, the foreigners, the missionaries?"" Many Haitians adopt informally. If they didn't you would see many more abandoned children on the earthquake-ravaged streets of Haiti's capital and in the countryside. Some kids do fall prey to the local restavèk system of child labor, but others are taken into loving homes, sharing equally the little bit their guardians have. Haiti's children have suffered more than any child, or adult, should have to, yet they still represent the best that Haiti has to offer. The potential for a better country rests on their shoulders. The survival of Haiti's children means the survival of Haiti. Their success guarantees the country's future. Like children all over the world, Haiti's children are resilient and brave, but they are also children, our children. If, as the African proverb states, it takes a village to raise a child, it will take several villages to raise these children. When it was discovered that the ""orphans"" who were being taken to the Dominican Republic by the 10 Idaho missionaries had parents, some people asked me how Haitian mothers and fathers could simply give their children away. I offered them the answer that a mother who turned her child over to an orphanage years ago recently gave me. ""It's like the way they were cutting up people's limbs to save their lives after the earthquake. I cut my heart out by letting my child go. Even if it means I have to cry every single day for the rest of my life, I want my child to have a future."" That future sometimes seems illusive. But it is as real as the children themselves. Worn out perhaps, but not totally defeated, dreaming, laughing, playing, living with a glint of hope and promise in their eyes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edwidge Danticat.","Edwidge Danticat says Haiti's children are brave and resilient .

"(CNN) -- The city councils in two of Arizona's largest cities have voted to file suit over the state's controversial new immigration law, which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency. The Tucson City Council voted 5-1 to file suit, and the city council in Flagstaff approved a similar measure 7-0. Both votes occurred Tuesday. Members of the Phoenix Suns basketball team, meanwhile, plan to wear jerseys that say ""Los Suns"" in a playoff game Wednesday as ""a way for our team and our organization to honor our Latino community,"" managing partner Robert Sarver said in a statement. Opposition to the law continued Wednesday, with some civil rights and labor organizations saying they will announce a boycott Thursday. Joining in Thursday's announcement will be the National Council of La Raza, which bills itself as the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States; the Asian American Justice Center; the Center for Community Change; the Service Employees International Union; and the United Food and Commercial Workers, the groups said in a release. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the immigration measure April 23. It is scheduled to go into effect this summer. Critics say the law will lead to racial profiling. Brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts. The city councils said they passed the measures because of concerns over enforcement costs and negative effects on Arizona's tourism industry. Opponents of the immigration law have called for a boycott of Arizona tourism and urge that no one engage in any commerce with businesses located in the state. In Tucson, council member Regina Romero introduced a motion for ""the city attorney to bring a legal challenge"" because the immigration bill is ""a bad law, which could cost the city millions of dollars in lawsuits and is unconstitutional."" ""This bill opens the door to racial profiling, and it puts Latinos in Arizona in automatic suspect mode,"" Romero said. Tucson Mayor Bob Walkup said up to 38 percent of retail sales in the city come from legal Mexican visitors. The state immigration law threatens those businesses, Walkup said, just when ""the city is just beginning to recover from the economic downturn."" The Mexican government issued an advisory to its citizens last week to avoid travel in Arizona. The Organization of American States expressed its concern about the law last week, and presidents of South American countries meeting in Argentina for a gathering of the Union of South American Nations condemned the law Tuesday. Well-known Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes recommended this week that dark-skinned people, men with mustaches, women who use shawls, or anyone who does not speak English well should not go to Arizona because the state has ""officially declared itself racist,"" the government-run Notimex news service reported Wednesday. The Phoenix Suns basketball team also criticized the new law. ""The frustration with the federal government's failure to deal with the issue of illegal immigration resulted in passage of a flawed state law,"" managing partner Sarver said. ""However intended, the result of passing this law is that our basic principles of equal rights and protection under the law are being called into question, and Arizona's already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks at a time when the state can ill-afford them.""","NEW: Civil rights and labor organizations say they'll announce boycott on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people across the globe took to the streets on Saturday in annual demonstrations for May Day, the annual event marked by demonstrations demanding better working conditions. Known as International Workers' Day, the holiday draws thousands to peacefully protest. Others, as in Athens, Greece, clashed with police amid growing anger over the government's stiff plans to grapple with the country's debt. About 12,000 people in Athens were on the streets, waving red flags and at times surging toward a line of police, who wore helmets and carried riot shields. Those disturbances led to injuries and arrests. A satellite truck was torched and two ATMs, the glass frontage of a bank and a car were damaged. In Russia, more than 2.5 million people participated in traditional May Day celebrations in 900 cities and towns, the country's trade union federation said. The largest gatherings took place in Krasnodar, Yakutsk, Vladivostok, Izhevsk, Moscow and St. Petersburg. The people spoke out in favor of decent salaries and stable employment.

"(CNN) -- A man coolly and calmly approached the screening area outside the Pentagon Thursday evening and opened fire, grazing two Pentagon police officers before they returned fire, critically wounding him, officials said. The incident happened at 6:40 p.m., when the man wearing a coat -- with ""no real emotion in his face"" -- approached the officers outside the Pentagon Metro station, said Pentagon Police Chief Richard S. Keevill. ""As the officers started to ask him for his pass to get into the Pentagon, he drew a weapon from his pocket and started shooting immediately at the officers"" from a few feet away, Keevill told reporters. ""He drew a gun and just started shooting immediately."" The two Pentagon Force Protection Agency officers returned fire with their semi-automatic Glock .40-caliber weapons and the suspect, thought to be a U.S. citizen, was critically wounded, Keevill said. He praised the police officers for acting ""quickly and decisively to neutralize him as a threat"" without hurting anyone else. Asked how many shots were fired, he said, ""Many."" Keevill would not identify the man. The Pentagon Force Protection Agency is the Pentagon's police department. Pentagon entrances were locked briefly but all were reopened with the exception of the Pentagon Metro entrance, the Pentagon said in a statement. Lisa McDonald, a spokeswoman for George Washington Hospital, said three people were being treated there -- both officers and the suspect.

"(CNN) -- The suspect in the killing of a University of Virginia student was arrested in a 2008 incident in which he threatened a police officer and was shocked with a stun gun, according to a police statement. George Huguely, 22, was arrested on suspicion of murder Monday, hours after a roommate found Yeardley Love's body in her off-campus apartment in Charlottesville, Virginia. Huguely, who was also a UVA student until resigning after his arrest, and Love played on the men's and women's lacrosse teams, respectively. CNN affiliate WDBJ got a police statement recounting an encounter between an intoxicated Huguely and Lexington, Virginia, Police Officer R.L. Moss. Affidavit: Lacrosse player killed in fight after breakup . According to the statement, Moss came across Huguely as he stumbled into traffic outside of a fraternity house at Washington and Lee University in Lexington. After ignoring the officer's calls to stop, Huguely was approached by Moss who, after speaking with Huguely, decided to arrest him for public drunkenness, the statement says. At that point, Huguely started making threats, including death threats, against the officer, according to the statement.

"(CNN) -- Faisal Shahzad had two faces, investigators and people who knew him say. He was a suburban father in Connecticut, married to an American citizen educated in Colorado. Wife Huma Mian, pretty and smiling in a Facebook picture, wore a traditional Muslim head scarf and posted on her page that she loved to shop. Shahzad, a Pakistani who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2009, worked as a financial analyst in Connecticut before leaving that job last June. His neighbors describe him as quiet and nice, but a little odd -- a man who liked to jog at night wearing all black and who once remarked that he didn't like the sunlight. Shahzad is suspected of trying to blow up a Nissan Pathfinder in Times Square on Saturday. He was arrested Monday night at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York as his flight to Dubai was about to take off, law enforcement officials said. Shahzad, 30, has been charged with five counts in connection with the case, according to documents filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York. The documents say he admitted to law enforcement officials that he attempted to detonate the bomb and that he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan region of Pakistan. Shahzad returned to the United States via a one-way ticket from Pakistan on February 3, according to a criminal complaint. He told immigration officials upon his return that he had been visiting his parents in Pakistan for the previous five months, the complaint said. Shahzad has a Karachi identification card, a sign of Pakistani residency, and his family is from northwestern Pakistan, according to Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik. His father is a retired senior officer in the Pakistani Air Force, Shahzad's cousin, Kafayat Ali, said on Tuesday. The father, Bahar Ul Haq, a former air vice marshal, lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad in Pakistan. Pakistani authorities in Karachi picked up for questioning  Iftikhar Mian, the father-in-law of suspect Faisal Shahzad, and Tauseef Ahmed, Shahzad's friend, on Tuesday, two intelligence officials said. An intelligence source said Wednesday that a different associate of Shahzad also was detained on Tuesday. That associate allegedly was instrumental in making possible a meeting between Shahzad and at least one senior Taliban official in Pakistan last July, a senior Pakistani official said Wednesday. It's unclear where Faisal Shahzad's wife, Mian, is now, although he told immigration officials in February that she was in Pakistan. Shahzad came to the United States and attended college, earning a bachelor's degree in computer applications and information systems from Connecticut's University of Bridgeport in 2000. He earned an MBA at the school in 2005. He started working as a junior financial analyst for Affinion Media Group in Norwalk, Connecticut, in 2006, leaving voluntarily in June 2009, according to Affinion spokesman Michael Bush. In October 2008, Shahzad reported getting married to Mian, who graduated from the University of Colorado-Boulder with a degree in degree in business with emphasis in accounting, university spokesman Bronson Hilliard said. A student from 2000 to 2004, Mian lived in a dorm the first few years, and then in family housing with her sisters her last two years at the school. Mian's Facebook page, which has apparently been disabled, had a picture with her smiling and wearing a hot pink head scarf. Shahzad, Mian and two children and Mian's two sisters lived in Shelton, Connecticut, for about three years, moving out in July 2009, according to neighbor Brenda Thurman. Mian spoke English, but was apparently so insecure about her language ability that she told people she did not, Thurman said. ""I never knew she spoke English until it was time for her to move,"" Thurman said. Thurman saw him in his yard with his children, a boy and a girl, and the family usually wore traditional Muslim attire, Thurman told WTNH-TV. Thurman said her daughter often played with Shahzad's daughter, but she herself didn't have much contact with the family. ""He also came out and played with them on occasion. He really loved his kids,"" Thurman told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Tuesday. She said Shahzad gave her daughter an old computer of his. Investigators were in the process of confiscating the computer on Tuesday, she said. Shahzad's wife told Thurman in July 2009 that the family was moving to Missouri. A few weeks after they left their home, the lender foreclosed on the property and changed the locks, Thurman said. At the Bridgeport, Connecticut, residence where authorities say he lived most recently, agents with the FBI and local police, including members of a bomb squad, conducted a search, and investigators removed filled plastic bags.

"OSLO, Norway (CNN) -- A week of events to mark the presentation of the Nobel Peace Prize to former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari continues Thursday with a stellar concert in Oslo to be broadcast on CNN.com Live. Former Finnish president Martii Ahtisaari was cited for his work in Namibia and Aceh, Indonesia. Actors Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson are due to host the gala event which features performances from Diana Ross, operatic quartet Il Divo and Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn. The concert will be carried by CNN.com live beginning at 2 p.m. ET Thursday (7 p.m. GMT Thursday). In an interview Wednesday, Ahtisaari called for a fresh Middle East peace initiative and warned that western powers risked losing credibility unless they acted to solve the conflict. Ahtisaari told CNN's Jonathan Mann that peace was a ""question of will."" ""All conflicts can be settled and there are no excuses for letting them become eternal,"" said Ahtisaari, who was cited for his work promoting Namibian independence in southern Africa and for his ""central role"" promoting peace in the conflict-stricken Indonesian province of Aceh. ""It is simply intolerable that violent conflicts defy resolution for decades, causing immeasurably human suffering and preventing economic and social development."" Ahtisaari said that finding a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians was crucial to the future development of the entire Middle East and Muslim world. ""As Western nations we are losing our credibility... because we can't keep on talking, year after year, that we are doing something. And no one sees any results,"" he said. ""People are suffering on both sides, and the saddest thing is that if we don't help the parties to solve those problems that are in the way of getting the agreement in the Middle East, the situation will become even worse for both parties."" Ahtisaari also called for fresh efforts to eradicate world poverty: ""We must all be able to contribute to our future and to the future of our communities. If the present trend continues, we will be faced with a situation where hundreds of millions of young people will be out of work in countries that are in the early stages in development. ""If nothing is done, we will be creating an effective breeding ground for crime, instability and war.""","Nobel Peace Prize events continue with gala concert in Oslo, Norway .

"(CNN)  -- Lionel Messi netted a double as Barcelona moved ever closer to retaining the Spanish league title with a 4-1 win over Tenerife at the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. The strikes were the 30th and 31st for the La Liga top scorer and the victory puts the pressure on arch-rivals Real Madrid for their tricky trip to Real Mallorca on Wednesday. It left Barcelona four points clear of Real, who must win their game in hand to keep their own title hopes alive. Argentina ace Messi put Barcelona ahead after 17 minutes and added a second in the final minute to seal victory against relegation-threatened Tenerife, who stunned the champions by equalizing just before half-time through Roman Martinez. It followed a mistake by home captain Carles Puyol, but Barca upped the pace after the break with goals from Bojan Krkic just after the hour mark and substitute Pedro Rodriguez giving them a comfortable cushion. Messi's late goal gave the scoreline a flattering look in a match played in driving rain, as Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes conceded. ""It was a difficult night due to the weather and the fixture list is already taking its toll but we gave our all,"" Valdes told AFP. ""It is a very competitive league and we have won our game and now we just have to wait."" Barcelona will be hoping Mallorca can come up trumps with their strong home record because they face a tough trip to Champions League hopefuls Sevilla on Saturday. Meanwhile in other action on Tuesday, Valencia clinched their place in the Champions League qualifying round, by clinching third spot, with a 3-1 home win over bottom club Xerez. Spanish international Juan Mata equalized a first half goal for Xerez with a superb free kick then added a second after the break. Mata then set up David Silva for Valencia's third.","Lionel Messi scores 30th and 31st league goals of the season for Barcelona .

"(CNN)  -- Chelsea King, 17, was a straight-A student, a high school track star and she loved to volunteer. Now, she's been killed, the latest victim of what you could call ""junk justice."" When Chelsea went running in a San Diego, California, park, it's doubtful she had any idea that another young female runner had been attacked in that very same park just a couple of months before. That first victim said she feared her attacker was going to rape her. She managed to get away by elbowing the large man in the nose. If there were falling rocks in that park, a warning sign would be up. If a hungry coyote had been spotted scrounging for food, a warning sign would tell you.  But there was no warning at all that a human predator, on the hunt for young women, might be in the park. If there had been a sketch of this suspect, or a warning posted, Chelsea might not have gone running alone there. Police said DNA on Chelsea's underwear led them to 30-year-old John Gardner III. They showed his picture to the first runner and she said, ""He's the same guy."" Now he's been charged with Chelsea's rape and murder. The suspect was a registered sex offender. In 2000, he lured a 13-year-old girl into his home on the pretext of watching the movie ""Patch Adams."" Once he got her inside, he molested her and beat her to a pulp before she escaped. Before Gardner was sentenced, a psychiatrist warned that he showed no remorse and would likely attack a young girl again. He recommended ""the maximum sentence allowed by law."" The courts sentenced Gardner to six years; he got out after five. Five years for pummeling a 13-year-old girl in the face and fondling her. That is ""junk justice."" If Gardner had been prosecuted to the full extent of the law then, he would have been behind bars when Chelsea went for a run on February 25. Her grieving mom spoke directly to this point to Larry King Thursday night...""I mean how many times do our daughters need to be raped before we put these monsters behind bars forever? I just don't -- I don't get it. Change has to be made. And I know that there are people out there that are -- that are trying to, you know, get this change in place. And Brent and I are committed for the rest of our lives to be a part of that."" We need to switch our focus from punishment to prevention. Our system only kicks into high gear after the fact. In this case, a warning sign, something that simple, would have cost a fraction of the millions it might take to prosecute and house the killer. A warning sign that a woman had been attacked in the park could have possibly saved Chelsea's life. In California, for every one parole officer there are 70 criminals.  Companies like Google, FedEx, and eBay use high-tech systems to track packages and information. We already have the technology in the form of ankle bracelets to track the sex predators so why not use it? Think about this. We can carefully track the delivery of a package across the country but don't keep track of a sex offender who weighs more than 200 pounds. It's time that we demand the most basic freedom of all, and that is freedom from fear.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan took the first step toward becoming the only Italian team to clinch a hat-trick of titles in one season by beating 10-man rivals Roma 1-0 in the final of the Italian Cup on Wednesday night. Diego Milito's first-half goal was enough to separate the two teams, who are only two points apart in the race for the Serie A title with two games to play. The Argentina forward fired his 26th goal this season five minutes before halftime to give Jose Mourinho his second trophy since taking charge of the Italian league leaders two years ago. Milito ran onto a fine pas from midfielder Thiago Motta, who made some amends for his red card in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal against Barcelona, and shrugged off a challenge to blast a shot past Roma goalkeeper Julio Sergio. Roma, who won the cup in 2007 and 2008 but saw city rivals Lazio lift the trophy last season, were reduced to 10 men with two minutes to play when veteran striker Francesco Totti received his second booking in the space of 25 minutes. Totti, usually the team's captain, had come on as a substitute at halftime. Mourinho had to make an early change when Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder went off injured in the fifth minute, to be replaced by young striker Mario Balotelli. Milito had the ball in the net in the 17th minute, but it was ruled out for offside. Meanwhile, Marseille won the French league title for the first time in 18 years with a 3-1 victory against Rennes on Wednesday night. The home victory put coach Didier Deschamps' team eight points clear of Lille and Auxerre with two matches to play. Lille claimed second on goal difference with a 2-0 win at Toulouse, while Auxerre lost 2-1 at fourth-placed Lyon.","Inter Milan take first step to becoming only Italian team to clinch a treble of titles in a season .

"New York (CNN) -- Faisal Shahzad made a practice run in Manhattan the day before he allegedly tried to blow up a car bomb in Times Square, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of his questioning. Last Friday, Shahzad drove his white Isuzu from Connecticut through Times Square, where he staked out potential locations for the following night's planned attack, the source said. He then parked the Isuzu several blocks away from Times Square, though the precise location was unclear, and took a train back to Connecticut, the source said. On Saturday night, with his recently acquired Nissan Pathfinder loaded with his makeshift explosives, Shahzad drove southbound along Manhattan's East River on FDR Drive to the 49th Street exit, the source said. Shahzad then pulled over and reached into the Pathfinder's rear compartment where he attempted to set into motion the process needed to set off the homemade bomb, the source said. The source, who did not explain how Shahzad had attempted to set off the bomb, said he then took a number of turns and wound up entering Times Square by driving south down Seventh Avenue. The source said Shahzad told investigators he turned right onto 45th Street toward Eighth Avenue because he saw a place to pull over. It's unclear why Shahzad left the Pathfinder's engine running and hazard lights blinking. But because of an incredible goof, Shahzad couldn't use his escape car. He had accidentally left the keys to that vehicle in the Pathfinder that he thought was about to blow up, the source said. He apparently went to a train station, where he boarded a Metro North train back to Connecticut. Another law enforcement source said investigators found a train receipt used by Shahzad that is stamped about 7 p.m., a half hour after a witness notified authorities that the car in Times Square was filing with smoke. Sources say investigators believe he ran to catch the train that pulled out around 7 or 7:15 Saturday night. The source added that police investigators have discovered a surveillance video of Shahzad walking in Shubert Alley -- which runs between 44th and 45th Streets just west of Broadway -- moments after witnesses saw the smoky SUV. In the video he is wearing a white baseball cap. Efforts also continued Wednesday to determine what may have motivated Shahzad. An official familiar with the investigation said Wednesday that Shahzad felt Islam was under attack. Any grudge Shahzad may have held against the United States appears to have developed recently, according to a senior U.S. official who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly. The investigation has found nothing to indicate that Shahzad had any long-standing grudge or anger toward the United States, the official said. ""What we know is, the dynamic appeared to have changed in the last year,"" the official said. Investigators have not determined whether Shahzad had any training from Pakistani groups in anything, the source said. Additionally, the official suggested, detentions in Pakistan have been carried out to collect information and not because officials had reached any conclusions about their guilt or ties to any groups. ""They are reaching out to people, bringing them in and doing their due diligence, but 'arrest' suggests a strong connection to the guy. While anything is possible, they haven't arrived at any conclusion,"" the source said. Authorities in Pakistan have rounded up a number of people for questioning, as U.S. law enforcement sought Wednesday to piece together the actions and motivations of Shahzad. Iftikhar Mian, the father-in-law of Shahzad, and Tauseef Ahmed, Shahzad's friend, were picked up in Karachi, Pakistan, on Tuesday, two intelligence officials said. An intelligence source said Wednesday that Muhammed Rehan, an associate of Shahzad, also was detained on Tuesday. Rehan allegedly was instrumental in making possible a meeting between Shahzad and at least one senior Taliban official, a senior Pakistani official said Wednesday. The official said that Rehan drove Shahzad on July 7 in a pickup truck to Peshawar, Pakistan. At some point, they headed to the Waziristan region, where they met with one or more senior Taliban leaders, the official said. Rehan is believed to have links to the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, which is close to al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban, the official said. Several officials in Karachi said Rehan was picked up in Karachi's North Nazimabad district. They said others were taken into custody for questioning on Wednesday, but could not say how many, who they were or where they were seized. A senior U.S. official said investigators were looking into possible links between Shahzad and Pakistani groups and had found none, ""but that doesn't say there is no connection."" The official added that there was nothing to indicate Shahzad is from an extremist family. Asked whether Shahzad was a ""wannabe"" who may be inflating his contacts, the source said, ""It is going to take a little more time for the investigation to gel."" Investigators have uncovered no evidence that Shahzad had U.S.-based associates related to the plot, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday. Investigators believe he handled the logistics himself, from purchasing the car to buying the materials for the bomb, the official said. Investigators are looking for any associates who may be overseas, the official said. The federal law enforcement official said Wednesday that Shahzad was still cooperating with the FBI and had waived his right to a lawyer. The official did not provide details about what Shahzad has been saying. The official acknowledged that the FBI lost contact with Shahzad while conducting surveillance of him prior to tracking him down aboard a plane set to take off from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, but the official did not say for how long. The official said agents had not wanted to tip off Shahzad that he was under surveillance, that the situation involved multiple locations and that Shahzad was aware of news reports that a suspect had been identified. ""There were a lot of traps out there to catch him if he did flee and, in the end, it worked,"" said the official. Shahzad, a 30-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Pakistan, was arrested late Monday at JFK airport after boarding a flight bound for Dubai, United Arab Emirates. His final destination was to have been in Pakistan. When authorities did track him down, Shahzad apparently was unsurprised. ""Are you NYPD or FBI?"" he asked. A Customs and Border Protection agent exposed his badge and said, ""CBP,"" an administration official said. In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that ""the Pakistanis are fully cooperating in the investigation. They recognize, as we do, that this is a shared responsibility and a shared threat."" The charges paint him as a terrorist who received explosives training in Pakistan's volatile Waziristan region, where government forces have been working to root out Taliban militants. The Pakistani Taliban, a major militant group in the region, praised Shahzad but denied any link to him. Read complaint filed in federal court Tuesday (PDF) Shahzad has been charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, and three other counts in connection with the incident. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison. Shahzad admitted he drove a Nissan Pathfinder into Times Square on Saturday night and attempted to detonate the vehicle, which was packed with gasoline, propane tanks, fireworks and nonexplosive fertilizer, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York. Court documents said that, after receiving bomb-making training in Pakistan, Shahzad returned to the United States via a one-way plane ticket February 3. Upon his return, Shahzad qualified for secondary, or more detailed, screening under Customs and Border Protection criteria and was interviewed, the administration official said. He told immigration officials that he had been visiting his parents in Pakistan for the previous five months, according to the documents. He also told officials that his wife remained in Pakistan. CBP, following protocol, sent a report to the FBI and other intelligence agencies that included Shahzad's passenger information, the official said. Included in that report were phone numbers associated with his travel, when he bought his ticket, and when he filed a customs form, the official said. Last weekend, as they investigated the failed bombing attempt, FBI agents turned up a telephone number but no name in connection with Shahzad's purchase of a Nissan Pathfinder. When agents searched databases containing the numbers called by or to that phone, they found the number on the CBP report, the official said. That is how they came up with Faisal Shahzad's name. The court documents show that Shahzad apparently maintained contact with people in Pakistan after returning to the United States. He received 12 phone calls from his country of birth in the days leading up to the incident -- five on the day he bought the Nissan Pathfinder used in the attempted attack. Those calls ceased three days before the failed bombing, the documents show. Authorities began focusing on Shahzad after tracing the sale of the Pathfinder to him. Shahzad has a Karachi identification card, a sign of Pakistani residency, according to Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik. Shahzad's father, Bahar Ul Haq, is a retired senior officer in the Pakistani Air Force. The former air vice marshal lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad, according to Kafayat Ali, whose father is a first cousin of Shazad's father. Shahzad lived at his father's house in Hayatabad when his father was posted in Peshawar, Ali said. Shahzad, his elder brother Amir and their two sisters moved with the father and received their education in the cities where the father was assigned. Ali said Shahzad's hometown is Mohib Banda, a village about 78 miles (124 kilometers) northwest of Islamabad, Pakistan. Ul Haq has farmland in Mohib Banda, and Shahzad and his siblings visited there during vacations and to attend relatives' weddings. Ali said Amir is a mechanical engineer living in Canada, where he is married and lives with his family. Both sisters are married; one is a doctor and the other is a housewife.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion advised. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Recently, VBS headed to Naples, the capital of the Campania region in southern Italy, to shoot two documentaries about the Camorra, the most powerful but least understood of the Italian crime cartels. One piece was about the peculiar world of the Camorra's homegrown Neapolitan pop stars, known as Neomelodics. The other, excerpted here, focused on the environmental emergency brought on by the Camorra's manipulation of garbage disposal in the region. Each proved to be a strange and infuriating experience. The daytime hours were spent visiting housing blocks where every family had reported at least one case of cancer because of illegal toxic waste dumps behind their homes. Our evenings, however, were spent at town square celebrations sponsored by the Camorra two blocks away and attended by the same families we had met earlier that day. The Camorra, it was suddenly clear, was dumping toxic waste in people's backyards and then hosting Neomelodic pop concerts in their front yards. See the rest of Toxic: Napoli at VBS.TV . Today, the Camorra's Naples is Italy on steroids, and it's the result of a marriage of convenience between two powerful Italian forces. Neapolitans we met were, on the one hand, fed up with the garbage situation. On the other, very few had any interest in pointing fingers at the Camorra. The Gerlando family is a prime example. On one of the last days of our shoot, we spent an afternoon with sheep farmers Patrizia and Mario Gerlando at their home in the Campanian countryside. The Gerlandos were forced to leave their home in the town of Acerra (a suburb of Naples) because all of their sheep were mutating and dying due to the high levels of dioxin in the pastures where they grazed. Despite Acerra being the most well-documented case of the Camorra's involvement in Campania's environmental crisis, after the cameras were packed away, Mario and Patrizia told us that the Camorra had nothing to do with anything and that it would take someone like Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to come fix the situation.","VBS finds documenting powerful Italian crime cartel ""strange, infuriating""

"(CNN) -- The Grand Ole Opry House is closed for repairs after record amounts of rain sent water 2 feet above its historic stage, damaging instruments, memorabilia and archival tapes at the country music landmark. Gaylord Entertainment Chief Executive Officer Colin Reed said he did not know how long the facility will be closed. The neighboring Gaylord Opryland Resort, a 2,881-room hotel, also is closed for restoration but will be open before the end of 2010, he said. ""We're going to do everything in our power to restore the stuff that's been damaged by water,"" Reed said Friday. He said that quick thinking by Opry management Sunday saved much of the memorabilia there. Shows scheduled at the facility will move to other Nashville venues during repairs, he said. Massive flooding has caused more than $1.5 billion in property damage in the Nashville area, city officials said Friday. Investigators were still searching for two people reported missing and surveying the damage in the city and surrounding Davidson County. The flooding damaged at least 1,952 residential properties, city officials said in a statement. Cleanup crews have collected about 80 truckloads of debris from flooded neighborhoods. Most of the water that inundated several neighborhoods in Nashville receded by Friday, seven days after heavy rain swelled the Cumberland River. One of the city's main water treatment plants remained closed because of the flooding Friday, prompting officials to tell residents to put off washing dishes and to limit toilet flushing. Last weekend's storm system devastated Tennessee and neighboring states, leaving at least 31 people dead in three states, authorities say. Twenty-one people have been confirmed dead in hard-hit Tennessee. One person died in a tornado in Hardeman County that was spawned by the storms, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The same storm system killed six people in Mississippi and four in Kentucky, emergency management officials said. The death toll could rise as rescue crews continue to search for several people who have been reported missing, including two kayakers in Kentucky and several people in Tennessee, officials said. ""Nashville has obviously been hard-hit, and it's a well-known city, but there are so many other counties in the state and areas ... that have been hit very hard as well,"" Gov. Phil Bredesen said Thursday morning. ""A lot of people who didn't have flood insurance, because they never thought floodwaters would ever come anywhere near their home, are really looking at a total loss of their home,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Conflicting reports emerged Sunday about whether Adam Gadahn, a U.S.-born spokesman for al Qaeda, has been arrested in Pakistan. A senior Pakistani government official told CNN that Gadahn was arrested Sunday in Karachi, and a second senior Pakistani government official later confirmed the arrest. But a U.S. intelligence official said there appears to be no validity to the reports that Gadahn was in custody, and other U.S. officials also said they have no indication that Gadahn has been captured. Reports of the arrest came hours after Islamist Web sites posted video of Gadahn praising the November massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. On the video, Gadahn said the U.S. Army major charged with gunning down 13 people ""lit a path"" for other Muslim service members to follow. Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, has  routinely posted lengthy videos on Islamist online forums. In 2006, he was indicted on charges of treason and providing material support to terrorists. The U.S. government has offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his capture. Authorities have targeted several key Islamist figures in Karachi, the populous port city and financial capital of Pakistan. For some time, it has functioned as a hideout for Taliban and al Qaeda sympathizers. One of the figures, top Taliban leader Agha Jan Motasim, was arrested on Friday. Motasim's capture came on the heels of the arrest of the Taliban's No. 2 figure and overall military commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Last month, Taliban and government sources confirmed that Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud had died. A government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of a January 14 unmanned drone attack in North Waziristan; other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi. A city of 13 million -- with some estimates of 100,000 new arrivals a month -- Karachi as seen an influx of Pashtuns from the tribal border region with Afghanistan. Many fled there during fighting and offensives in the Northwest Frontier Province and Waziristan, making it a comfortable place for the Taliban to blend in and count on a network of supporters. ""I think its become apparent ... that al Qaeda doesn't really have a base of sanctuary inside Afghanistan, at least not one where its leaders feel safe,"" CNN's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson said. ""They've taken to hiding inside Pakistan."" Gadahn's reported presence in Karachi ""is an indication of how easily it is for al Qaeda sympathizers and Taliban sympathizers to hide in that city,"" Robertson said. Gadahn, 31, grew up on a California farm and was home-schooled until 17. A year later he moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were secular Jews. He converted to Islam at the Islamic Society of Orange County, California, but was banned from the mosque two years later after hitting its chairman, Haitham Bundjaki. In 1997 Gadahn began working for a California charity suspected of having ties to al Qaeda. He moved to Pakistan in 1998. His family has said they last heard from him in 2002. In 2004, the FBI identified him as part of an al Qaeda cell that was planning attacks aimed at disrupting that year's presidential election in the United States. In October 2004, he began appearing in disguise in al Qaeda videos. Gadahn dropped the disguise in 2006. In 2008, he renounced his U.S. citizenship and destroyed his passport in another al Qaeda video. In his video message posted online Sunday, Gadahn says Muslims should emulate the alleged Fort Hood shooter. ""I believe that defiant Brother Nidal is the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" Adam Gadahn says in English in the video. Maj. Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist and a U.S.-born citizen, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder in the November 5 killings. Hasan is also facing 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder and is eligible for the death penalty. ""The Mujahid brother Nidal Hasan is a pioneer, a trailblazer and a role model who has opened a door, lit a path and shown the way forward for every Muslim who finds himself among the unbelievers and yearns to discharge his duty to Allah and play a part in the defense of Islam and Muslims,"" Gadahn says in the video. Gadahn also cites in Sunday's video the U.S. and allied buildup in Afghanistan, where the United States is in the process of adding about 30,000 troops. ""It is rapidly becoming clear that this already-hot global battle is about to get even hotter,"" he says. ""This is a war which knows no international borders and no single battleground, and that's why I am calling on every honest and vigilant Muslim in the countries of the Zionist-Crusader alliance in general and America, Britain and Israel in particular to prepare to play his due role in responding to and repelling the aggression of the enemies of Islam."" In December, Gadahn released a video message in English offering condolences to ""unintended Muslim victims"" killed in attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere. It was a rare example of al Qaeda offering condolences to the families of those killed in the group's own attacks. CNN's Zain Verjee contributed to this report.","NEW: Two Pakistani officials say Gadahn arrested; U.S. intelligence official casts doubt .

"(CNN) -- So, let's say you're flying into town for the beginning of your trial and you're running a little late. What do you do? A. Call the Court. Or, . B. Ask your twin brother to go to court and pretend he is you. It doesn't appear to be a difficult question, but in Clearwater, Florida, one defendant made the wrong choice, and two brothers are now in jail. According to court officials, 40-year-old Matthew Mauceri was due in court Tuesday morning for the beginning of his trial on scheming-to-defraud charges. But, court officials said, he was flying in from out of town and when he realized he wasn't going to make it on time, he called his twin brother, Marcus, for help. So, Marcus Mauceri showed up in the courtroom of Judge Joseph Bulone, with Marcus claiming he was Matthew, according to the officials. It was Matthew Mauceri's defense attorney who judged that something was amiss, court officials said, and he alerted Bulone. In the judge's chambers, defense attorney James Thomas told Bulone he had represented both brothers previously, and that the right brother might not be present in court. Bulone put Marcus Mauceri under oath, and according to court transcripts, Marcus swore that he was Matthew. The judge launched a quick investigation. ""One of our fingerprint technicians was called by the judge to do a print comparison,"" said Sgt. Tom Nestor of the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. ""They made a comparison and said, 'No, this is not Matthew,'"" Nestor said. Bulone then appointed a public defender for Marcus and, according to a court transcript, declared, ""I'm just going to find that by Marcus pretending to be Matthew ... that perpetrates a fraud upon the court."" Marcus Mauceri was charged with criminal contempt and sentenced to 179 days in jail. Marcus told the judge he would appeal, and that he would hire his own attorney. ""As usual, perpetrators of crimes don't usually think the consequences through, and as is often the case, it doesn't work out for them,"" court spokesman Ron Stuart said. Later, Matthew Mauceri appeared and was cited for failure to appear and contempt of court. His $100,000 bond from his original case was revoked. Court officials said the twins were remanded to the county jail -- in separate cells.","Man running late for trial asks twin brother to stand in for him, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Germany captain Michael Ballack is used to the huge pressure soccer can bring after a long career competing for major honors on the domestic and international stage. The midfielder has won four league titles in Germany, three while at Bayern Munich, and can boast two English Premier League successes and two FA Cup's with current club Chelsea. Yet there is one thing missing from Ballack's impressive CV: success with his national team. The 33-year-old was in the German team beaten to the trophy by Brazil at the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, then on home soil in 2006 his side were knocked out in the semifinals by eventual winners Italy. Ballack also skippered Germany to second place at the European Championships in 2008, losing 1-0 to Spain in the final. But, as he told CNN Sport's Alex Thomas, he is hoping to lead his side to glory in South Africa in what will be his last World Cup. CNN: There have been so many great German footballers down the years, it must be hard when you become first of all an international, and then captain of your country. It's not the same as being captain of a smaller country -- Germany has such a record, do you feel that extra weight and pressure? Ballack: To be honest it's not a pressure, it's an honor to be captain of Germany and when I became it in 2004 I was really proud that I could make the step to be captain after Oliver Kahn. There were so many good captains during the years, we have such a great history in the country and to be part of this makes me proud. Also it's pressure because you have to have success, you have to win games, you have to win titles and that's what it's all about in our country because it has a great history. Hopefully we can carry on. CNN: Does it make you laugh, you play your football in England now and we're always up in arms if England make it to a quarterfinal or a semifinal, and Germany seem to make it to the final every time. It's completely different. Ballack: Not every time, but most of the time we can do it. A lot of people in England ask me how can you do this with your country because sometimes we go into a tournament and we are not the favorites but we can always do well, and that's a quality we have. I don't know where it comes from, maybe the history, but we can be really concentrated during the tournament, and especially in the big events most of the time we've done really well. CNN: You're coming up to your third World Cup, how has the experience in 2002 and 2006 affected how you will approach the next one? Ballack: Experience is always important. I played in 2002 and 2006, once I finished second, once I finished third, so one place improvement maybe. When we get into a tournament it's always step by step, we have to think from round to round. Obviously it's the last one I will play so it gives me big, big motivation to play a good tournament this year. I think it's a bit similar to the past that when we go in the tournament we have a good team. We played a good qualification, but we are not one of the top favorites so maybe it plays a little into our hands. We have quite a young team, and if there is not too much pressure on the team maybe it will help the team a little bit. CNN: You've had two great honors now, or you will have. You've had playing a World Cup on home soil in Germany and we're coming up to the first World Cup to ever be held in Africa -- you've been lucky with how your career's been timed. Ballack: Yeah, absolutely. To play a World Cup in your own country as a captain is not normal. When we saw the draw in 2001 or 2002 that we had the World Cup in 2006 we were all really excited because it was a big chance to play a World Cup in your own country. If I look back, it was a great tournament for us, it was a great few weeks. Everybody was so excited in the country, big parties all over the cities and now it's a different thing. It's the first World Cup in Africa, it's a little bit new for everybody. Germany was so well-organized, everybody expects the same now, but it's a totally different thing now. The fans have a different mentality, it will be a lot different but in a good way hopefully. That's why I think everybody is looking forward to it. CNN: What do you make of your group opponents? Ballack: We have a tough group. Australia, Serbia and Ghana, they're all really physical teams. So it will be really tough for us. CNN: You're on 98 caps, assuming Germany do well in the World Cup you'll be well over the 100 mark and really among some of the top players that have ever played for Germany. I think no-one's going to catch Lothar Matthaus, who has 150, are they? But is that important to you, how you're remembered in the history of your country's players? Ballack: It's always nice if you can be part of the history and well-recognized. I mean that's what everybody wants, but the most important thing for me is that I'm happy with myself. When I finish my career I can say I did well, I gave my best, and if a few more caps come it makes me happy. There's not really a target, 100 is a big number and hopefully I can reach them soon. What comes after I will see. I've really enjoyed the times I've played for Germany, every game is special for me, so hopefully I can play a few more. CNN: I asked everyone in the office, I said Michael Ballack has played 98 times, how many goals do you think he has scored for Germany, and they all said 10, 15, 18 and I said 42. They couldn't believe it. Why is your strike rate so good for your country? Ballack: I don't know 100 percent, but I was always a midfield player with a lot of determination in the box. I want to score goals. I always scored a lot of goals when I was young, I've scored in every position in my career, from a defender to a striker when I was young. I think I learned it when I was young, I had it in the blood a little bit to score goals. That's what I always try to do for my country and I'm really proud that I could score so many goals. CNN: Is the World Cup still the biggest tournament for players? Ballack: I think so. You play for your club every year, week in week out, so it makes it exciting and special, but the World Cup is something bigger. You play it every four years, the best teams in the world playing each other. Even the atmosphere during such a big tournament, you go in the bus driving to a game and you see all your fans supporting you. They feel so excited even you feel something special.","Germany midfielder Michael Ballack talks to CNN Sport about the 2010 World Cup .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Karen Richardson may not have known where she would end up, but she has always known that with hard work, anything is possible. Karen Richarson, a White House staffer, says anything is possible in America. Richardson, 30, works as a White House staffer on what the Obama administration sees as the most pressing issue of the day: health care reform. She meets with President Obama several times a week and expresses the same kind of determination and sense of hard work to her job. ""You have to continue to plow forward and just keep working until it gets done,"" she explained. ""I stay focused on the job at hand and I'm committed to getting this done."" Richardson didn't always want to work at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  As a student at Howard University, a historically black college, she developed a passion for international affairs and originally wanted to follow the path set by another African-American woman. ""Watching [former Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice at the prime point of her career, [I began] thinking, 'I can do this.' "" So Karen moved to Italy and started working for UNICEF. But then she got a call from someone asking if she might be interest in interning for ""this new guy, Barack Obama."" Watching the news from abroad, she didn't know much about Obama, a senator at the time, except that he was the guy ""with Kenyan roots,"" as she put it.  So she decided to put her dreams of international field work on hold and give Capitol Hill a try. ""I thought, 'Well, I've never done anything on Capitol Hill, I've never worked over on Capitol Hill.' "" Karen recalled, ""So this would be a great opportunity and let me just go see what this is about and learn as much as I can while I'm there,"" What was supposed to be a six-month internship with Obama's Senate office became a full-time position after only three months, and she followed that trail all the way to Pennsylvania Avenue. Although Karen's journey to the White House was never ""inconceivable"" to her, she still takes time to appreciate how far she has come. ""I don't want to lose sight of what it took to get here, what it means to be here and what an extraordinary honor it is to be working for President Obama,"" Richardson said. ""I have those moments every day and I really do try to remind myself every single day why I'm here and what an extraordinary privilege it is."" She also tries to go back to her alma mater to speak to students, particularly African-Americans who might not think they, too, can work at the White House someday. ""It gives me the opportunity to go back and speak about my path because it can inspire them,"" Richardson explains. ""It's changing a perspective for them in light of what it is they can achieve."" ""The American dream is accessible to anybody,"" Karen said. ""Your options and the possibilities in life are really limitless.""","Karen Richardson, 30, is a graduate of Howard University in Washington .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic overcame current top-ranked player Serena Williams in an epic clash to reach the final of the Italian Open on Friday. However, hopes of an all-Serbian showdown were dashed when the return to form of another previous No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, was ended by Spaniard Maria Jose Martinez-Sanchez in the other semifinal in Rome. Jankovic, who won the clay tournament in 2007 and 2008, followed up her quarterfinal victory over Serena's fourth-seeded older sister Venus by triumphing 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5) in two and three-quarter hours. The seventh seed fought back from 3-0 and 4-2 down to save a match-point in the deciding tie-breaker as she overcame what seemed like delaying tactics by the American when serving on a vital point. ""I was just getting ready to serve and I was serving and all of a sudden she wasn't ready,"" Jankovic told reporters. ""For me when the server comes to play the receiver has to be ready -- that's the rules. ""But unfortunately I had to hit another serve, regroup and refocus because I didn't want to waste my energy on that."" Williams was seeking to repeat her 2002 Rome triumph in what was her first tournament since winning the Australian Open in late January, injuring her knee in doing so. ""I almost feel like I won that match. I can't be really upset, but I am,"" she said. ""I feel I should have won -- I could have won. But I can't beat myself up over it, I've just come back and hadn't played a match since January."" Ivanovic, who has slumped to 58th in the rankings since winning the French Open in 2008, was seeking to reach her first WTA Tour final since March 2009. But she was unable to show the form that this week knocked out ninth seed Victoria Azarenka and Olympic champion Elena Dementieva as she was crushed 6-4 6-2 by world No. 26 Martinez-Sanchez. Her 27-year-old opponent followed up her own upset win over world No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday by reaching her third WTA Tour final. She won minor clay tournaments in Colombia and Sweden last year, and lost in the final in Barcelona the year before. Martinez-Sanchez has played Jankovic only twice, winning on hardcourt in 2001 when the Serbian retired hurt and losing on clay last year in the Fed Cup teams event.","Jelena Jankovic beats world No. 1 Serena Williams in three-set epic to reach Italian Open final .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A London department store has started selling coffee for $100 a shot. Civet cats: The coffee beans are collected from the animal's faeces. If the price sounds unappealing, shoppers also have to overcome the unusual method of cultivation, which sees the coffee beans harvested from the feces of an Indonesian jungle cat. Even so, the Peter Jones store says the luxury blend -- called Caffé Raro -- is one of the world's rarest and most premium coffees. Made by the Italian company De Longhi, Caffé Raro combines Jamaican Blue Mountain and Kupi Luwak, two extremely rare coffees. The beans of Kupi Luwak are harvested after being ingested by civet cats, and only about 260 kilos (about 573 pounds) of the coffee is produced each year. ""The cats select the best beans to chew. It's rather like a natural filtering process,"" said Carie Barkhuzen, a spokeswoman for the upmarket store in London's upmarket Sloane Square. The coffee, which went on sale Thursday, is available at $100 for a shot at the Peter Jones Espresso Bar, or shoppers can buy 100g (3.5-ounce) packs of the coffee beans to take away for the same price.  Watch some willing to try the coffee, others not » . ""It's not exactly flying off the shelves -- it's very expensive, after all -- but customers are buying it,"" Barkhuzen said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A 19-year-old Jordanian bent on committing ""violent jihad"" was arrested Thursday after undercover FBI agents foiled his attempt to bomb an office tower in Dallas, Texas, authorities announced late Thursday. Authorities say a suspect tried to set off a bomb attached to a vehicle at the base of the Fountain Plaza tower. Federal officials said Hosam Maher Husein Smadi, who entered the U.S. illegally and lived in Texas, tried to set off an improvised explosive device attached to a vehicle at the base of the 60-story Fountain Plaza office tower. Counterterrorism officials arrested Smadi on Thursday before publicly disclosing a similar, but unrelated, terrorism sting arrest in Springfield, Illinois, Wednesday. A federal law enforcement official familiar with the cases said authorities feared word of the Illinois arrest could tip off the Texas suspect of an undercover sting operation. In a criminal complaint filed with Smadi's arrest, counterterrorism officials said the suspect had been under ""continuous surveillance"" because of oft-stated determination to inflict damage and death against the United States, which he deemed to be an enemy of Islam. ""The identification and apprehension of this defendant, who was acting alone, is a sobering reminder that there are people among us who want to do us grave harm,"" said James Jacks, the top federal prosecutor in Dallas. After casing a Wells Fargo Bank in the office tower in July, Smadi told an undercover agent he would target the facility, according to authorities. Initially Smadi told the agent he wanted to conduct the bombing on September 11, but decided to wait until Ramadan ended September 20, authorities said. ""Unbeknownst to Smadi, the FBI ensured the [vehicle-borne IED] contained only an inert/inactive explosive device, which contained no explosive materials,"" the Justice Department said in a written statement. Smadi will make his first court appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Dallas on Friday. The charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction carries a potential sentence of up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. Justice Department officials said the Dallas case was unrelated to the similar FBI sting in Springfield, Illinois, a day earlier when FBI undercover agents foiled a plot to bomb that city's federal building. In neither case did authorities find ties to known terrorist groups.","Authorities: Man, 19, tried to set off bomb at the base of 60-story office tower .

"London, England (CNN) -- The United Kingdom spent a second day suspended in uncertainty Saturday as leading politicians met to resolve a national election that failed to yield an outright winner. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, whose party came in third after Thursday's voting, held meetings with fellow party members Saturday to discuss a possible deal with either of the two largest parties, Labour and the Conservatives. Clegg also met with Conservative leader David Cameron Saturday night, local media reported, while a broader meeting between Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party is scheduled for Sunday morning, a Liberal Democrat spokeswoman told CNN. During a break in the talks with his own party, Clegg addressed hundreds of protesters in London who were demonstrating in favor of proportional representation, a system supported by the Liberal Democrats. Send iReport your stories, videos, photos . The Lib Dems say the current electoral system is unfair and leaves them under-represented in Parliament. They say the number of seats they have in the House of Commons fails to reflect the number of votes they won across the country, and they believe each party's allocation of seats should reflect the percentage of the national vote they get. For example, the Conservatives got 36 percent of the vote and 306 of the 650 seats in Parliament. Under proportional representation, they would have gotten 234 seats. The Lib Dems got 23 percent of the popular vote but won only 57 seats. Proportional representation would have given them about 150 seats. ""I never thought I'd see Londoners protesting for proportional representation,"" Clegg said. ""Take it from me, reforming politics is one of the reasons I went into politics. I campaigned for a better, more open, more transparent new politics every single day of this general election campaign. ""I genuinely believe it is in the national interest, it is in the interest of everybody in Great Britain, to use this opportunity to usher in a new politics."" Before he went into the meeting with members of his party Saturday morning, Clegg said ""politicians have a duty to speak to each other."" ""People deserve a good, stable government, and that's why I'm very keen that the Liberal Democrats should enter into any discussions with other parties, as we're doing, in a constructive spirit,"" he explained. What happens next for UK politics? The Liberal Democrats planned to meet with the Conservative Party at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) Sunday, according to a Liberal Democrat spokeswoman. When asked, a spokeswoman for the Conservative Party declined to give a timeframe for a possible deal. Why UK politics needs to get used to horse trading . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who leads the Labour Party, and the Conservatives' Cameron both offered on Friday to form an alliance with the Liberal Democrats as they jostled for power after the election in which the Conservatives gained the most seats in the House of Commons. Clegg told reporters Saturday morning that he remained focused on four priorities as he discussed the idea of a deal with another party: tax reform, education reform, a ""new approach"" to the economy, and ""fundamental political reform."" Full election coverage . ""It's precisely those four changes which will guide us in the talks ahead,"" Clegg said. In an e-mail to Conservative supporters on Saturday, Cameron made a case for the party to work with the Liberal Democrats. ""I ... believe there are many areas of common ground between us and the Liberal Democrats -- such as the need for education reform, building a low-carbon economy, reforming our political system, decentralizing power, protecting civil liberties and scrapping ID cards,"" Cameron wrote. It's unclear how far Cameron will go on the Liberal Democrats' main priority, electoral reform. But he said in his e-mail that he is willing to compromise on some issues. ""There are also areas where I believe we in the Conservative Party can give ground,"" he wrote, ""both in the national interest and in the interests of forging an open and trusting partnership. For example, we want to work with the Liberal Democrats to see how we can afford to reduce taxes on the lowest paid."" Brown, who remains prime minister even though Labour lost its parliamentary majority, said Friday that he would be willing to negotiate with any party leader. What role does the queen play now? Official returns Friday showed it would be impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats, resulting in what is known as a hung parliament. The Conservatives came in first, with at least 306 seats in the 650-seat parliament, followed by Labour with at least 258. The Liberal Democrats came in third, with at least 57. The Conservatives must forge some kind of deal with a smaller party in order to reach a voting majority in Parliament, and they are most likely to turn to the Liberal Democrats, analysts have said. Parties smaller than the Liberal Democrats hold too few seats in Parliament for them to be realistic choices for the Conservatives, analysts have said. It's also easier for the Conservatives to seek a partnership with just one party rather than many, said Joe Twyman, director of political polling at YouGov. Such a partnership, however, does not necessarily have to take the form of a coalition, Twyman said. ""My personal opinion is that the most likely scenario is the Conservative Party forming a minority government and going into some sort of leg-by-leg association with the Liberal Democrats,"" Twyman told CNN on Saturday. ""The Conservatives hope that will give them the support they need to get across their economic policies, which are the most pressing."" Anger at polling stations . Though they are dubbed the kingmakers, because their support could be crucial to either of the two big parties, the Liberal Democrats also don't have much room to play with, Twyman said. The last time Britain had a hung parliament was in February 1974, when Edward Heath's Conservatives gained more votes but fewer seats in Parliament than Labour. Unable to form a deal with the Liberal Party, the Conservatives stayed on in a minority government, but found themselves back at the polls by October. ""As the Lib Dems are reported to have significantly less financing than the other two parties, they would have the most to lose from another election being called very soon, because elections are an expensive business,"" Twyman said. CNN's Melissa Gray, Richard Greene and Paul Armstrong in London contributed to this report.","No party won a clear majority in British election, resulting in hung parliament .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- When Shay Kelley lost her marketing job she got worried. When she lost her home and her car she got mad.

""I was like, 'Just tell me what my purpose is, tell me why I'm here and if you'll just tell me I'll work harder than for anything I have ever worked for anything else in my entire life.'

She began to meet homeless people as she dropped off the canned goods, and she says they have surprised her with their generosity. She met Donald, a retired Navy sailor, at a library in South Carolina. ""He invited me to go to lunch to buy me a hot meal because I had been eating PowerBars for three days,"" Kelley says.  ""I found out after he left -- after he paid the tab and paid my meter -- that Donald was homeless, that he was actually living in the shelter.""

She posts her pictures on her website and Facebook page as she goes. She has more than 1,000 Facebook fans following her travels. See more of Kelley's photos . One of those Facebook followers is Laurie Holleman Sherrod, who contacted Kelley with an unusual request: . She asked Kelley if she could find her son, Trey. The last time she heard, he was living on the streets in Santa Cruz, California. ""I thought that's crazy, how do you find one homeless person in an entire city?"" Kelley recalled. But she agreed to try and sure enough a few weeks later she happened upon a nice young man on the streets of Santa Cruz. ""And then here I am sitting around the table with Trey shooting a video for his mother who lives in South Carolina."" As with everything that has happened to her so far, she credits her faith with guiding her. ""It is so important to me that God remains in the forefront of my life,"" she says. ""He leads me.

"(CNN) -- The only surviving gunman in the 2008 attacks on Mumbai that killed more than 160 people was sentenced to death by hanging on Thursday. Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted on Monday of murder, conspiracy, and waging war on India. He was sentenced to death on five separate counts, and life imprisonment on five others. On receiving the sentence, Kasab lowered his head. He was silent when the judge asked him if he wanted to say anything. Kasab is the only man to have been sentenced in connection with the three-day siege in November 2008. During the raids, 10 men attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks. India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility. Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack.

"(CNN) -- It's difficult to overestimate Quincy Jones's contribution to American music. Over the last 60 years he has excelled as a musician, composer, record producer, arranger, conductor and media company executive. Quincy Jones has won 27 Grammy awards during his extraordinary career. In a career studded with landmarks, Jones produced Michael Jackson's multi-platinum albums ""Off The Wall,"" ""Bad"" and ""Thriller"" -- the best selling album of all time -- and produced and conducted ""We Are The World,"" one of the biggest-selling singles in history. Quincy Delight Jones Jr., known to his friends as ""Q,"" was born on March 14, 1933, in Chicago. He moved to Seattle as a child and began playing trumpet aged 12. When he was 14 he befriended a young Ray Charles, who taught him how to arrange music, and Jones was soon playing bebop in nightclubs, backing up the likes of Billie Holiday. In 1951, Jones won a music scholarship at prestigious Schillinger House, in Boston, but he abandoned his studies to tour with bandleader Lionel Hampton. By the mid-50s, he was arranging and recording for the likes of Sarah Vaughan, Duke Ellington and his old friend Ray Charles. In 1956 he toured with Dizzy Gillespie's Big Band, recording his first album as a leader in the same year. In 1957, Jones moved to Paris to study music composition and theory, taking a job with Mercury Records' French distributor to pay for his studies. After a European tour proved a financial disaster, the president of Mercury offered him a position at the record label and Jones soon became vice-president at the company. In the 60s, Jones worked as a conductor and arranger for Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. He also began scoring music for films, including ""In the Heat of the Night,"" ""In Cold Blood"" and ""The Pawnbroker,"" which featured his hit ""Soul Bossa Nova,"" later re-used as the theme to the ""Austin Powers"" movies. Jones would go on to score 33 movies during his career and he also composed the themes for TV shows such as ""Ironside,"" ""The Bill Cosby Show"" and ""Roots,"" which earned him an Emmy award. Having made his name as a composer and arranger in the 70s, he moved away from jazz to record a series of hit albums of his own soulful music. See photos of Quincy in Seattle » . Jones's career was dramatically put on hold in 1974, when he suffered a severe aneurysm, but it did little to stall his incredible drive. In the 80s, as well as producing three Michael Jackson albums and ""We are the World,"" he co-produced and scored the Steven Spielberg movie ""The Color Purple,"" and formed multi-media company Quincy Jones Entertainment. In his role as CEO he was executive producer of TV series ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" and published ""Vibe"" and ""SPIN"" magazines. His 1989 album ""Back On The Block"" won Album Of The Year at the Grammys and 1993's ""Miles and Quincy Live At Montreux"", featuring Jones conducting Miles Davis, earned another Grammy. All in all, Jones has won 27 Grammys, been nominated for seven Academy Awards, and has added to his business interests with Quincy Jones Media Group and Qwest Broadcasting. Perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle, Jones has long been involved in social activism. He supported Martin Luther King's Operation Breadbasket, which promoted economic development in the inner cities, and worked on Reverend Jesse Jackson's People United to Save Humanity project. Jones founded the Listen Up! Foundation, which has worked on youth projects in Los Angeles and South Africa, and he helped launch the We Are the Future project, which helps children in poor and conflict-ridden areas. He is also one of the founders of the Institute for Black American Music (IBAM), which raises money to establish a national library of African-American art and music. Over the course of his incredible career, Jones somehow found the time to marry three times and father seven children. In 1990, his life was chronicled in the movie ""Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones"" and in 2001, Jones published ""Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones.""  Watch Quincy Jones on My City_My Life » . Of his own career, which has taken him from being a teenage musician in the clubs of Seattle to a world-famous music mogul, Jones says, ""You have to turn all of your drunken dreams into sober realizations. I think I was blessed with the ability to see things and make them happen before everybody else saw them.""","Quincy Jones has excelled as a musician, composer and record producer .

Goldie made a name for herself starring in romantic comedies that highlighted her sense of humor as well as her acting chops. If that sounds familiar, it's because it's the same exact career trajectory her gorgeous daughter Kate Hudson chose to take. Along with loads of talent, these two also share a love for a laid-back California-girl style. Blythe Danner and Gwyneth Paltrow . Acclaimed actress Blythe Danner passed along regal good looks and a whole lot of talent to her Oscar-winning daughter.

Eva's racking up the acting credits with stints on Californication and How I Met Your Mother and drawing all eyes on the red carpet in boldly hued designs by pal Chris Benz. It's no wonder Eva should befriend the fashion elite -- her mother took her to Todd Oldham and Diane von Furstenberg shows when she was just a kid. Jane Birkin and Charlotte Gainsbourg . Seeing as how her mother had an Hermes bag named after her (the Birkin), it's no surprise that Charlotte Gainsbourg has become a style icon herself.

"(CNN) -- There are few sports that are so dominated by a single person like the way the women's pole vault is ruled by 26-year Russian Yelena Isinbayeva. Eyes on the prize: Yelena Isinbayeva has often complained about a lack of real competition in her event. Every time the world and Olympic champion competes it is expected that she will spring to new heights and push women's pole-vaulting to new levels. She has broken the world record 16 times, almost equaling the feat of the great Sergey Bubka, who broke the men's outdoor pole vault record 17 times between 1984 and 1994. Since jumping to her first world record in 2003 and becoming the first woman to jump over 5-meters in 2005 she as also become something of a glamorous sporting celebrity. After setting five new world records in 2005, it took almost three years for her to set a new mark of 5.04m in July 2008, a fallow period that made her pursuit of world records a personal matter. After setting her world record mark in July this year at a competition in Monte Carlo, she told press: ""I wanted to improve my personal best and that's what I did. I see this world record as a personal one."" A driven and focused competitor, she has also become famous for her coolness under pressure. Before her latest world record jump she was driving around the track in the back of a vintage car with sprinter Asafa Powell, while her fellow competitors had already started the competition. Not shy of media and publicity, her sporting achievements, athleticism and looks have made her a pin-up for women's athletics and attracted a number of big-name sponsors. While her achievements can be allied to that of Bubka it has been noted that her media- and sponsor-friendly attitude makes her more akin to compatriot Maria Sharapova. Her celebrity status is a world away from her modest background. Born in Volgograd in 1982 it was only until a couple of years ago that she lived with her parents and younger sister in the city of her birth, before moving to Monte Carlo. She trained first of all as a gymnast until the age of 15 when her coach decided she was too tall. Commentators and fellow competitors have noted that her gymnastic training has helped give her an extra edge in the event. After defending her title in Beijing, her place in the sporting pantheon of great female athletes seems secure. While emulating Bubka, Isinbayeva has said before that closing the gap between the heights the men and women can jump is another of her personal challenges, and with her own talent and the help of Bubka's former coach she may go a long way towards achieving that.","World and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva dominates her sport .

"(CNN) -- The man credited with making Chicago's Metra commuter train line one of the best in the country is an apparent suicide, killed Friday by the train he himself rode five days a week for more than two decades. Shortly before 8 a.m., Phil Pagano drove to a parking lot about two miles from his home in unincorporated Crystal Lake in suburban Chicago, walked onto a track where someone had committed suicide three years ago and stepped in front of an oncoming Metra train, McHenry County Sheriff Keith Nygren told reporters. The train's lone engineer ""saw a man standing on the tracks turning and looking at the train,"" Nygren said. ""There was eye contact, he felt, between himself and the victim."" Pagano, Metra's executive director, made no attempt to step off the tracks, and the train, which was traveling between 45 mph and 55 mph, could not stop in time, Nygren said. None of the 27 people on the train was hurt. They included 24 passengers, two Metra employees, and the engineer, a Union Pacific employee. The passengers completed their trips in taxis; no other trains were delayed as a result of this incident, Nygren said. ""We have secured evidence at the scene and at the victim's residence that would indicate that this was an intentional act on his part,"" he said. A deputy on routine patrol came across the body within a minute of the incident, Nygren said. He described the scene as ""very gruesome."" Pagano's death came a week after Metra announced it was investigating whether the 60-year-old married father of two daughters got an unauthorized vacation payout last year of $56,000, said Metra spokeswoman Judy Pardonnet. It also came two hours before the Metra board was to have met to hear from an independent investigator about the allegation against Pagano, who was on paid administrative leave from his $269,000-per-year job. The meeting was delayed, Pardonnet said. She said the apparent suicide was out of character for a man who cared deeply for his job and his co-workers -- so much that he made sure train personnel received counseling after witnessing similar incidents. She credited her former boss with having transformed the Chicago rail system from one that in the 1980s was ""dilapidated and rundown"" to one that is now ""the top among commuter railroads."" ""This is a man who had an absolutely impeccable record and, honestly, was viewed as probably the premiere leader of commuter rail in the country."" Metra, for which Pagano had worked since its formation in 1984, moves 300,000 passengers per day along 11 lines over 550 miles of track serving six suburban communities in an area the size of Connecticut, she said. Before that, he held several positions at the Regional Transportation Authority in Illinois. On-time performance, according to Pardonnet, is routinely at or above 97 percent, the best of any major city in the country and a record that area residents have grown to count on. ""We literally get e-mails from people who say, 'My train was four minutes late twice this week, and I find that unacceptable,' "" Pardonnet said. ""He's had a fabulous and unprecedented career and that makes it even more tragic."" ""Phil served this agency with distinction for many years,"" Metra said in a written statement. ""Today, we shall remember the good work he achieved with our board of directors and the men and women of Metra. He was dedicated to our passengers and he always considered the men and women of Metra his family and there is a tremendous sense of loss within the agency."" Deputy Executive Director Bill Tupper was named appointed acting executive director of Metra, which after New York is the nation's second-largest commuter rail system, said Meg Reile, another Metra spokeswoman. The investigation was initiated after Metra officials received a tip from Greg Hinz, a reporter for Crain's Chicago Business, about the claim, Pardonnet said. ""Phil Pagano surely didn't go to work for Metra to grab money he wasn't entitled to,"" Hinz wrote Friday on his blog. ""Nor do reporters get into the news business to provoke suicides."" He added, ""I and others I've talked to who were involved in the matter are, frankly, rattled. Writing about this is part of my job, and the job needs to be done. But that doesn't mean you don't feel bad. I do. I am sorry it had to end this way.""","Phil Pagano made Chicago's Metra commuter train line one of best in country, many say .

"(CNN) -- A major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to cause substantial environmental damage along the Louisiana and Florida coastline. Here CNN's Jim Boulden explains the circumstances behind the leak and the consequences for oil giant BP as efforts to limit the disaster get underway. What caused the oil spill? It seems workers on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling rig (not owned by BP) were attempting to cap this new exploratory well when it suffered a ""blow"" causing the fire and sinking of the rig and the rupture of the line which brings extracted oil to the shore. Investigators will want to see what caused the explosion. iReport: How is the oil spill affecting you? What are BP's offshore operations?  BP took over two big American oil companies in the 1990's, ARCO and AMOCO which gives BP access to many U.S. oil fields and refineries. There has been a slew of new oil and gas finds in the Gulf of Mexico in deep water. BP, like many of its competitors, is drilling exploration wells there to gauge the oil and gas potential. The well, known as Mississippi Canyon (MC) Block 252, is in the 'Macondo prospect'. The well in question is 65 percent owned by BP and has other oil companies as minority partners. It's the norm these days for competitors to invest in these speculative wells. Will BP have to foot the bill for the clean up?  BP CEO Tony Hayward has said BP will take full responsibility for the spill and that they will honor ""legitimate"" claims for compensation. In a press release Monday the company said: ""BP is committed to pay legitimate and objectively verifiable claims for other loss and damage caused by the spill - this may include claims for assessment, mitigation and clean up of spilled oil, real and property damage caused by the oil, personal injury caused by the spill, commercial losses including loss of earnings/profit and other losses as contemplated by applicable laws and regulations."" As of May 10, BP said the clean up has cost it $350 million which includes money for the failed dome, also a $100 million block grant to four states and $100 million to drill that relief well. Its not clear if BP has received any money from its partners Anadarko and Mitsui, which together control 35 percent of this particular project. BP is also expected to try and recover some costs from Swiss-based Transocean which own the rig that caught fire and sank. How much will all this cost? The clean up and the lawsuits together could total $3 billion, according to a research note Friday from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. But even that figure could be higher if the incident hits BP's reputation to the point where other firms no longer want to do business with them or if future oil exploration is limited as a result of the spill. Will anyone face legal action over the spill?  This is the United States after all. What effect has it had on BP's share price?  BP shares are like an oil tanker most days -- they don't move much and tend to trend with the oil price. But BP shares have been falling for days and at last count the company's shares have lost some 8 percent last week. Why does something like this impact on share price?  BP may have to spend billions of dollars to make this right. Also, BP could cut its very generous dividend to preserve cash, if it comes to that. The Texas City Refinery fire in 2005 has cost BP some $1.5bn and counting. Will it have an impact on BP's profits?  This was not a working well, so BP will not lose any amount of oil and gas in its portfolio. But at some point it will have to""'book"" the costs of all this and that will have an impact on its bottom line. Having said that, BP earns $5-7 billion from ""ongoing activities"" EVERY quarter ($27.7 billion in total for 2009). It had a $5.5 billion ""replacement cost"" profit in Q1 2010. It can afford this.","BP took over U.S. oil companies ARCO and AMOCO in the 90s .

"(CNN) -- Veteran goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt has received his first international call-up since 2003 as Germany coach Joachim Low named seven players from Bayern Munich in a preliminary 27-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa. The 35-year-old Butt will be competing for a starting place with Schalke's Manuel Neuer and Werder Bremen's Tim Wiese as Bayer Leverkusen's Rene Adler has been ruled out with a rib injury. Captain Michael Ballack, who plays for English club Chelsea, is the only man selected who does not feature in the German Bundesliga. Stuttgart's Brazil-born forward Cacau is included, but his former clubmate Thomas Hitzlsperger misses out despite the absence of injured Leverkusen midfielder Simon Rolfes as he has not been playing regularly for his Italian club Lazio. ""This was a very difficult decision for me,"" Low told reporters on Thursday. ""Thomas has never disappointed us and made a key contribution in helping us qualify. ""He is a reliable player, but he barely played in the last few months before he left Stuttgart and has also played very little at Lazio."" Low will reduce the squad to 23 by the June 1 deadline for submission ahead of the tournament's kick-off 10 days later. Butt, who has won three caps, will not be able to feature in next Thursday's friendly against Malta as he will be needed by Bayern in the German Cup final against Bremen in Berlin on May 15. His clubmates Holger Badstuber, Mario Gomez, Miroslav Klose, Philipp Lahm, Thomas Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger will also sit out the Malta game in Aachen along with Bremen's Wiese, Per Mertesacker, Marko Marin and Mesut Ozil. The 21-year-old Badstuber has yet to win a cap for Germany and made his senior debut for Bayern in the first game of this season, covering at left-back despite being a central defender. Attacking midfielder Muller, 20, will seek to add to his sole cap after also impressing this season, scoring the first hat-trick of his career in the 3-1 win over Bochum last weekend which effectively gave Bayern the league title. Ballack will also be away playing for Chelsea in the FA Cup final on May 15, before joining the squad in Sicily with the Werder quartet, while the Bayern players will not be in camp until after the Champions League final on May 22. Bayern, who had eight players in the squad that finished third on home soil four years ago, can complete the first leg of a potential treble by clinching the Bundesliga title this weekend, when Louis Van Gaal's side face bottom club Hertha Berlin. Germany will face Hungary in Budapest on May 29 and then Bosnia-Herzegovina in Frankfurt on June 3 before heading to South Africa. Germany squad: . Goalkeepers: Manuel Neuer (Schalke 04), Tim Wiese (Werder Bremen), Hans-Jorg Butt (Bayern Munich).

"(CNN)  -- Chelsea routed 10-man Wigan Athletic 8-0 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday to dethrone Manchester United as English Premier League champions. United, who needed Chelsea to slip up in the final match of the season, beat Stoke 4-0 at Old Trafford, but it proved academic as Chelsea brushed aside Wigan in ruthless fashion. First half goals from Nicolas Anelka and Frank Lampard from the penalty spot effectively sealed the title for Carlo Ancelotti's high-scoring team, but they turned on the style after the break to delight their fans. Wigan, a man light after Gary Caldwell was sent off just before halftime in conceding the penalty, were overwhelmed as Didier Drogba hit a second half hat-trick. His strike partner Nicolas Anelka added a second, with Salomon Kalou and England left back Ashley Cole also on target. Big-spending Chelsea have had to play second fiddle while United have won three straight titles and it was a sweet moment for their captain John Terry. ""Magnificent, it's been a hard three years to see Manchester United lift it,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It's been up and down all year and we went away to Wigan and got beat, but after we went ahead 1-0 today it was the first time I thought that the title was ours,"" he added. Chelsea can complete the domestic double with victory over cash-strapped Portsmouth in the FA Cup final at Wembley next weekend, while for United there was bitter disappointment as they remained a point adrift. Wayne Rooney also sparked a World Cup scare when he limped out of the easy win at Old Trafford with what appeared to be a recurrence of the groin problem he first picked up at Blackburn last month. Before that, Darren Fletcher and Ryan Giggs scored before the break. A Danny Higginbotham own goal and Park Ji-sung's late diving header doubled their advantage but it was all in vain. Rooney had gone into the match level with Drogba on 26 league goals in the race for the Golden Boot, but could not add to his tally. Ivory Coast international Drogba had been denied the chance to take Chelsea's first half penalty as regular taker Lampard ushered him away. He openly showed his disappointment, but after the break all was forgotten as he finally got on the scoresheet, including a penalty, with Lampard this time making way as the victory was assured. Drogba's first and Chelsea's fifth took them to 100 goals for the season, the first time this has been achieved since the Premier League was created. But Ancelotti revealed that he had to speak with Drogba at halftime to tell him to calm down. ""It was my decision, if there was a penalty, to give it to Lampard,"" he told Press Association. ""I told him to stay calm and quiet because he'd have opportunities to score in the second half. I said: 'Quiet. You can score in the second half.""' In other action on the final day of the season, Arsenal clinched third spot with a 4-0 home win over Europa League finalists Fulham while north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur stay fourth after losing 4-2 at relegated Burnley.","Chelsea thrash Wigan Athletic 8-0 to clinch English Premier League title .

"London, England (CNN) -- Conservative Party leader David Cameron said it was ""clear that the Labour government has lost its mandate to govern this country,"" as exit-poll predictions put his party on course to win more seats than it had for 80 years. He said the Conservatives had fought a ""positive and energetic"" campaign. It was clear from the results that ""the country wants change"" and ""that change is going to require new leadership."" Exit polls suggest the Conservatives are on pace to win 305 seats -- though this would be 21 short of a majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave no indication early Friday that he would step down after being returned to parliament by his constituents in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. Full election coverage . The ""outcome is not yet known but my duty .. is to play my part in Britain having a strong, stable and principled government,"" he said. ""I will not let you down. ""I am very determined and have been through quite a lot in my political career and in my personal life, and I am used to difficulties."" If the predictions are borne out by results, the UK is heading for a ""hung parliament"" in which no single party controls an overall majority. The leader of the largest party traditionally gets the first chance to form the government and become prime minister. But if no party has a majority, the sitting prime minister has the right to stay in office and try to win a confidence motion in parliament. ""The sitting prime minister and the incumbent government are given the first chance to create a majority that commands the confidence of the House of Commons, and if they fail to do that it passes to the leader of the opposition,"" top Labour politician Peter Mandelson told CNN. Brown arrived at Labour Party headquarters in London early Friday after flying in from Scotland. He smiled and shook hands as he entered the building with his wife, Sarah, but said nothing to waiting cameras and reporters. Several high-profile incumbents lost their seats overnight, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, of Labour; Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, leader of the Democratic Unionist party; and Liberal Democrat Lembit Opik, who had been in parliament for 13 years. All had been implicated in last year's parliamentary expenses scandal. Robinson's loss could hurt the Conservatives, robbing them of a potential supporter in the Commons should the party need to form a coalition. The Green Party, which favors environmental and social justice policies, gained its first-ever member of parliament when Caroline Lucas was elected in Brighton, in southern England. There were some scenes of voter anger across the country over long lines to cast ballots or polling stations running out of ballot papers, but it was not immediately clear how widespread problems were. Anger at polling stations . ""We will be doing a serious and thorough review of this and making recommendations to parliament and the government,"" Electoral Commission Chairwoman Jenny Watson said. The United Kingdom's system of voting is ""Victorian, antiquated, left over from an era when less people had to vote"" and not designed to cope with mass participation, she said, adding that the system is now ""at breaking point."" It's very unusual for no party to get an absolute majority of seats in the Commons. The last time it happened, in 1974, voters were back at the polls within months. After the election there will be 650 seats in the Commons, four more than in the previous parliament. Voters chose representatives for only 649 seats, however, because the death of a candidate in northern England postponed that election to May 27, local officials said. Under the British electoral system, the candidate who receives the most votes in a constituency wins. The system, known as ""first past the post,"" is praised for its simplicity and the strong ties it forms between voters and representatives, but critics dislike its failure to provide proportional representation. CNN's Zain Verjee, Richard Greene and Paul Armstrong in London contributed to this report.","Exit poll projects David Cameron's Conservatives winning 305 seats .

"(CNN)  -- Porto striker Hulk has been called up to the Brazilian squad for friendly internationals next month against England and Oman. Hulk, whose full name is Givanildo Vieira de Souza, has starred for the Portuguese giants since joining them last year following three seasons in J-League football in Japan. He scored twice to give Porto a 2-1 Champions League win over APOEL Nicosia of Cyprus last week. Hulk will be battling for a starting place with established stars such as Kaka of Real Madrid and Sevilla's in-form Luis Fabiano. Brazil coach Dunga is using the friendlies to try out fringe players ahead of next year's World Cup finals in South Africa. He is also giving a chance to Liverpool's Favio Aurelio, Lyon's Michel Bastos and Carlos Eduardo of Bundesliga side Hoffenheim. Manchester City's Robinho also returns to the 24-man squad after recovering from an ankle injury which caused him to miss the final round of South American Group qualifiers. But there is not place for AC Milan pair Ronaldinho and Alexandre Pato while Dunga has not picked players from the domestic Brazilian league such as forner World Cup hero Ronaldo and ex-Inter Milan star Adriano.

"Washington (CNN)  -- The man charged in the failed Times Square bombing was working with the Taliban movement in Pakistan, the U.S. attorney general said Sunday. ""The evidence that we have now developed shows the Pakistani Taliban directed this plot,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said, describing the investigation into suspect Faisal Shahzad during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""We know that they helped facilitate it, we know they helped direct it, and I suspect we're going to come up with evidence that shows they helped to finance it,"" Holder said. John Brennan, the assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the Pakistani Taliban -- also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban, or TTP -- is closely allied with al Qaeda. The group has pledged to carry out attacks outside of central Asia, including the United States, Brennan said Sunday. Shahzad has been charged in the May 1 attempted bombing in Times Square. He was arrested while trying to fly out of New York on Monday night, two days after he allegedly attempted to set off a car bomb in Times Square. The bomb failed to detonate. It was the second case in the past six months of a bungled terrorist attack in the United States, following the failed bombing of a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day. Brennan said U.S. counterterrorism efforts had degraded the ability of groups such as al Qaeda and the Taliban to launch successful attacks. ""They're trying to find vulnerabilities in our defenses,"" Brennan said, noting the attempts have been ""unsophisticated."" Shahzad, a Pakistani-American, had traveled to Pakistan several times in recent years, Brennan said. ""He was captured by the murderous rhetoric of al Qaeda and TTP,"" Brennan said of the suspect. Preventing attacks by individuals, especially American citizens such as Shahzad, is a ""very difficult challenge,"" Brennan said. The case raised new questions about whether terrorism suspects should be read the Miranda warning that advises them of their rights to remain silent and obtain legal representation. Critics have accused the Obama administration of losing interrogation opportunities by giving Miranda warnings to terrorism suspects, including the alleged Christmas Day airplane bomber and Shahzad. Brennan said Shahzad was interrogated for four hours under an exclusion to the Miranda warning involving public safety. Authorities then advised Shahzad of his rights, as required by law, Brennan told the ""Fox News Sunday"" program. ""It did not impede our ability to continue to acquire very important intelligence from him,"" Brennan said. ""It was, I think, a very good example that law enforcement, operating within ... the existing system, were able to leverage the opportunities that they had to get this information."" Also on the Fox program, Republican Rep. Peter King of New York argued a change in the Miranda warning was necessary. ""If there's another 10, 15, 20 plots out there, that to me is more important to get all the intelligence we can on that,"" King said. ""So I think we may have to work on revisions."" One idea, King said, would set up ""separate system of justice dealing with American citizens who are allied with a foreign army or a foreign enemy."" Holder also said Sunday that he was considering possible changes to the Miranda warning. Asked whether international terrorism made the current Miranda warnings too limited, Holder told the ABC program ""This Week"" that some adjustment may be necessary. The system is working so far, Holder said, but ""we also want to ... make determinations as to whether or not we have the necessary flexibility, whether we have a system that can deal with the situation that agents now confront."" ""We're now dealing with international terrorism,"" Holder said, adding that his department would work with Congress ""to come up with a proposal that is both constitutional, but that is also relevant to our time and the threat that we now face.""","NEW: Faisal Shahzad linked to Pakistani Taliban, U.S. attorney general says .

"Washington (CNN) -- CNN has reported President Obama has personally met with four leading candidates for the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy. The president is expected to announce his nominee in coming days so the Senate can complete the confirmation process in time for the new Supreme Court session in the fall. Justice John Paul Stevens, who turned 90 last month, announced that he will retire shortly after the Supreme Court's term ends in late June. Here are summaries of the four people believed to be finalists for the Stevens seat, and a list of arguments for and against their nominations: . Elena Kagan . U.S. Solicitor General . Year born: 1960 . Hometown: New York (Manhattan) Experience: Solicitor general; Harvard Law School dean; White House associate counsel . Education: Princeton University; Oxford University; J.D., Harvard Law School . Fun fact: Former law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, who nicknamed her ""Shorty"" Top cases argued as solicitor general (in support of federal laws or executive action): . • Campaign finance reform (Citizens United v. FEC, 2009): Congressional efforts to restrict ""independent spending"" by corporations and unions in federal political campaigns. Supreme Court ruled against the government in January. •  Terror support (Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 2010): Whether the government's power to criminalize ""material support"" of a terrorist organization goes too far in restricting civil liberties. Supreme Court ruling pending. •  Religious monuments (Salazar v. Buono, 2009): Can a war memorial shaped like a cross remain on government parkland, or does it violate the constitutional separation of church and state? Justices ruled for the government, saying the cross should remain. Why she may be chosen: Her lack of a substantive paper trail on hot-button issues may blunt initial conservative criticism over where she stands on these topics. She has a reputation as a political pragmatist and consensus-builder who enjoys the support of liberal and conservative academics. That perceived ability to reach across the aisle could help Kagan on a divided high court. Her relative youth (she would be the youngest member of the court) could give Obama a longer judicial legacy. She also would provide greater gender diversity to the bench. Why she may be passed over: That lack of judicial experience may raise concerns about whether she would be a ""reliable"" vote on the left. Some liberal groups have also raised concerns that Kagan -- as solicitor general -- has articulated a more robust defense of executive power by the White House than many civil rights and human rights groups would like. Judge Diane Wood . 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Chicago, Illinois . Year born: 1950 . Hometowns: Plainfield, New Jersey; Houston, Texas . Experience: Federal appeals judge; University of Chicago law professor; government lawyer in the Carter, Reagan and Clinton administrations . Education: B.A., J.D., University of Texas . Fun fact: Talented oboe player who plays in local orchestras . Top cases as federal appeals judge: . • Abortion protests (National Organization for Women vs. Scheidler, 2001): Wrote the opinion allowing extortion and anti-racketeering (RICO) laws to be used against a group of anti-abortion protesters. The case was reversed twice by the Supreme Court, 8-1 and 8-0. • First Amendment (Doe v. Lafayette, 2004) -- Dissented in a case that ruled a convicted sex offender could be banned from an Indiana city's parks. The offender admitted observing minors there but left without molesting them. • Religious displays (Bloch v. Frischolz and Shoreline Towers Condominium Association, 2008): Disagreed in a ruling allowing a condominium association to prevent a Chicago family from putting up a Jewish decoration on their doorpost. Her strong dissent prompted Wood's entire court to reconsider, which then reversed and adopted her views on the issue. Why she may be chosen: Sharp intellect and consensus-building skills have served her well on a court dominated by conservative judges. Her gender, Midwest base, non-Ivy league education and long academic record would bring diversity to the high court. She also would be the only Protestant on the bench. Wood's working mother status would be seen as a political plus for a White House courting female voters. Why she may be passed over: Her judicial record on abortion, religion and immigration cases could present serious roadblocks. Conservatives have privately said she would be the least acceptable of the top contenders, and vow a political fight over her nomination. Her age (she turns 60 on July 4) also could hurt her chances. Judge Merrick Garland . D.C. Circuit, U.S. Court of Appeals, Washington . Year born: 1952 . Hometown: Chicago . Experience: Federal appeals judge; Justice Department lawyer in the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations . Education: B.A., J.D., Harvard University Law School . Fun facts: Met President Richard Nixon as a 17-year-old high school student as part of Presidential Scholars program. Later, as a top government lawyer, supervised the prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombing and Unabomber defendants. Top cases as federal appeals judge: . • Terror detentions (Parhat v. Gates, 2008): Wrote opinion that concluded the government improperly classified a Guantanamo detainee as an enemy combatant. • Discrimination (Barbour v. WMATA, 2004): Allowed a Washington, D.C., government worker to sue for disability discrimination. He was supported in the ruling by then-colleague and good friend John Roberts, now chief justice. • Environment (Rancho Viejo v. Norton, 2003): Parted ways with Roberts by refusing to rehear a case over federal protection for the rare arroyo toad, and sided against a California developer who challenged the Endangered Species Act. Why he may be chosen: Little controversy is noted in his personal and professional lives. Colleagues call him a brilliant legal mind, well-respected by nearly everyone. He is viewed as a liberal moderate, and many conservative activists say they could support his nomination. That tacit endorsement could erase any protracted political fight, if the White House seeks a smooth, swift confirmation. Why he may be passed over: Many liberals question his ideological credentials, and fear that as the replacement for the left-leaning Stevens, Garland could move the court incrementally to the right on a number of key issues. He would add little diversity to the court, being a white male with an Ivy League background. Judge Sidney Thomas . 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, San Francisco, California; he is based in Billings, Montana . Year born: 1953 . Hometown: Bozeman, Montana . Experience: Federal appeals judge; private attorney . Education: Montana State University; J.D., University of Montana Law School . Fun fact: Enjoys skiing and hiking with his wife and two sons, friends say . Top cases as federal appeals judge: . •  Strip searches (Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 2006): Wrote opinion striking down San Francisco's body-cavity strip search policy for all newly arrested inmates. Full appeals court later reversed. •  Student rights (Harper v. Poway Unified School District, 2006): Supported a San Diego high school that banned a student from wearing a T-shirt reading ""Homosexuality is Shameful,"" saying such expressions are disruptive and that gay students and school personnel have a right to be free of such messages, especially in school campus settings. •  Terror prevention (Public Citizen v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 2009): Dissented in this national security case, where the majority said federal regulators could not be ordered to require greater safety measures at nuclear power plants. The commission ""owes the public a rational and reasonable explanation why it would exclude from its [safety] rule consideration of terrorist air attacks,"" Thomas said. Why he may be chosen: Western roots would add real regional diversity to the court, and his home-state education may be seen as a plus for a bench dominated by Ivy leaguers. Little is known about him inside the Beltway, but colleagues praise his low-key demeanor, plain-talking intelligence and quiet sense of humor. Why he may be passed over: On a court with a majority of five white males, Thomas would not add much diversity, if the president deems that an important quality. His low profile may not give him many strong supporters among the president's closest aides. Friends privately say Thomas himself is downplaying his chances, and that he is surprised just to be considered among the finalists and to have had a personal meeting with Obama on the vacancy. CNN Political Research Director Robert Yoon contributed to this report.","Elena Kagan known as a political pragmatist, but lacks judicial record .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has test-fired two ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, the military said Saturday. Both the Shaheen-1, which can hit a target 400 miles (650 kilometers) away, and the Ghazvani, with a range of 180 miles (290 kilometers), were fired successfully, Pakistan military officials said. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, who witnessed the event with several senior military officials, said that the nation had developed a strong nuclear deterrence capability, according to a government statement. He said that Pakistan's armed forces were ""fully capable of safeguarding Pakistan's security against all kinds of aggression,"" according to the statement. Gilani mentioned last month's Nuclear Security Summit hosted by President Obama in Washington, an event aimed at enhancing international cooperation to prevent nuclear terrorism. Much of the event focused on Iran's nuclear program, which has drawn deep concerns from the West. However, the international community also has had concerns about the stability of the Pakistani government and the security of its nuclear arsenal, questioning whether it's safe from the hands of the Taliban. Gilani on Saturday said the world can now move ""beyond safety and security concerns,"" the statement said. ""These were laid to rest at the Nuclear Security Summit where Pakistan forcefully projected a forthright stance on the issue and the world expressed satisfaction at Pakistan's nuclear security arrangements."" Estimates of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal currently range from 60 to 100 weapons. It first declared its status as a nuclear power in 1998, testing five bombs in an exchange with its south Asian archrival, India.","Pakistan successfully tests two nuclear-capable missiles, military says .

"(CNN) -- Hall of Fame football linebacker Lawrence Taylor was charged Thursday with rape and patronizing a prostitute in a case involving a 16-year-old girl, police in Ramapo, New York, said. Taylor's attorney said the former New York Giants star denied the charges and will fight them. ""My client did not have sex with anybody. Period,"" Arthur Aidala said, adding: ""Lawrence Taylor did not rape anybody."" Taylor appeared at an afternoon court hearing where a judge set bail at $75,000. Taylor was not asked to enter a plea and left the courthouse after posting bail. Seeing television cameras outside the courthouse, Taylor said, ""I'm not that important"" as he walked away. Taylor, 51, was arrested in a Holiday Inn room a few hours after the alleged rape took place, according to Christopher St. Lawrence, the town supervisor and police commissioner in Ramapo, about 30 miles northwest of New York City. Police Chief Peter Brower said Taylor was charged with third-degree rape, a felony, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone younger than 17. Taylor also was charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage victim $300 to have sex, Brower said. According to Brower, the rape charge carries a possible four-year prison term, and the patronization charge, a misdemeanor, could bring up to a year in prison. Asked whether Taylor knew that the victim was underage, Brower said ""ignorance is not an excuse"" for having sex with a minor. Aidala said after the bail hearing that Taylor ""is denying and preparing to fight each and every one of those charges."" Aidala said that ""no violence, no force, no threat, no weapons"" was involved in the case. He noted that the rape charge against Taylor was for consensual sex with a minor and said Taylor denied it. St. Lawrence and Brower said the alleged victim, since March a runaway from New York's Bronx borough, was allegedly brought to Ramapo by a pimp on Wednesday night. When the pimp and the girl returned to New York early Thursday, she texted an uncle who notified the New York police, St. Lawrence said. New York police arrested the pimp and called Ramapo police, and Taylor was arrested in his hotel room at around 4 a.m., according to St. Lawrence. The alleged victim had facial injuries that police determined occurred before she entered the Holiday Inn room, St. Lawrence said. Detective Lt. Brad Weidel said police knocked twice on Taylor's hotel door and identified themselves before entering the room. Weidel and St. Lawrence said Taylor was cooperative with authorities. Taylor was a 10-time All-Pro linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981 to 1993 after earning All American honors at the University of North Carolina. A punishing tackler and pass rusher known by his initials ""L.T.,"" he was on two Super Bowl champion teams and was inducted into the National Football League's Hall of Fame, which noted that he ""redefined the way the outside linebacker position was played."" However, Taylor was twice suspended by the NFL for substance abuse and battled a cocaine addiction long after retirement, resulting in several arrests and a downward spiral that he chronicled in a 2003 autobiography. After kicking drugs, he worked as a sports commentator and appeared as a contestant on ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" in 2009. Taylor and his dance partner on the program, Edyta Sliwinska, were eliminated in the seventh week of competition. Brower said that police found a bottle of alcohol in Taylor's hotel room but that Taylor showed no sign of inebriation. Brower said that no drugs were found in the room. Mark Lepselter, Taylor's agent, said Taylor was very upset about the charges against him. ""He's worked very hard over the last 12 years to change perceptions about him,"" Lepselter said. CNN's Ross Levitt and Alan Chernoff contributed to this story.","Taylor leaves courthouse after posting $75,000 bail .

"(CNN) -- President Obama named Solicitor General Elena Kagan as his nominee to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. CNN.com asked legal experts and commentators the significance of Obama's selection, what to expect from Kagan as a Supreme Court justice and what lies ahead in the confirmation hearings. Patricia Millett, a partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld in Washington, D.C, who co-chairs its Supreme Court practice. She has practiced extensively before the Supreme Court, where she has briefed approximately 70 cases and argued 28 cases. She spent 11 years appearing before the court as an assistant solicitor general during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations: . While many have said that President Obama's replacement of Justice Stevens will not affect the direction of the court, it must be remembered that Supreme Court nominations are long-term investments for a president. In that regard, Elena Kagan is an excellent investment. If she follows her predecessor's lead, she will spend four decades serving the nation on the court. While I agree that her arrival is unlikely to shift the court's jurisprudence significantly in the short term, she will likely remain on the court long after some of its leading conservative justices have retired. Her brilliant intellect, affable personality, persuasiveness in oral and written advocacy and proven ability to build bridges and develop common ground among very independent thinkers (such as Harvard Law School faculty) will make her a true judicial leader on the court and will ultimately have a weighty influence on the development of the law throughout her tenure. Even in the short term, her powerful reasoning and consensus-building will likely influence the outcome of some cases. Remember that 90 percent of the court's decisions are workaday rulings that do not capture headlines, yet that is the field in which the justices' inter-relationships and patterns of dialogue are forged. Finally, like all of the female justices who have preceded her on the court, Elena Kagan has impeccable qualifications and ability. I sincerely hope that, with her appointment as the court's third sitting female justice and fourth in history, we will find ourselves coming to the point where the female gender of a nominee is no longer a novelty. It is past-due time for the appointment of women on the court to be accepted as a commonplace. Julian E. Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School in New Jersey: . With a year under his belt, we can now say that Elena Kagan is a quintessential Obamanian pick. Foremost, she has impeccable academic credentials; Obama likes to fill positions with the best and the brightest. When she appears before the Senate, her knowledge of the law will be impressive and can put senators on the defensive. Furthermore, her positions are difficult to characterize politically. Like Obama, she is somewhat elusive. Kagan has enough on her record, such as supporting certain expansions of executive power, to concern the left and enough on her record, such as her position on military recruitment on campuses, to anger the right. This will make her more difficult for Republicans to target effectively during the confirmation hearings. Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies and editor-in-chief of the Cato Supreme Court Review at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.: . Kagan is not the worst choice, but other short-listers would have been better in various ways. While any Obama nominee would have similar views on hot-button issues like abortion and gay rights, Diane Wood would have been great on antitrust and complex commercial litigation, for example, and Merrick Garland would bring a stronger understanding of administrative law. Generally, there is no indication that the solicitor general is anything but a standard modern liberal, with all the unfortunate views on the scope of federal power that that entails. Another concern is her mediocre performance in her current position. I question the choice of arguments she made in Citizens United and United States v. Stevens, for example -- in the first case abandoning the court's rationale in the precedent she was defending, in the second asserting that protection for speech varies inversely on the speech's social value. But she may be better suited to a judicial rather than advocacy role. With Democrats holding a large Senate majority, Kagan's confirmation is in little doubt.  More interesting will be the debate over constitutional limits on government. Guy-Uriel Charles is a law professor at Duke Law School in North Carolina, where he is the founding director of the Center on Law, Race and Politics. He is Haitian-American and blogs at http://www.coloreddemos.blogspot.com/// . We know a lot about Elena Kagan's biography and background. She was an academic, the first woman dean of Harvard Law School, worked for President Clinton, and is the current solicitor general. But we know very little about her views. With the exception of some strong comments about military recruitment at Harvard, she has not expressed or taken any positions on the significant public policy issues of the day. She has not developed or communicated any ideas about the role of the Supreme Court in a democratic society. She has not been at the forefront of legal thinking on any difficult constitutional matter. Indeed, the fact that we know so little about her views is apparently one her qualifying characteristics. Her nomination thus sends a very clear message to aspirants to the Supreme Court: If someday you wish to be nominated to the Supreme Court, say nothing of substance. We have created a process by which our most thoughtful leaders, individuals such as Harvard's Lani Guinier, University of California Irvine's founding dean Erwin Chemerinsky, University of Chicago's Geoffrey Stone, Stanford's Pamela Karlan and so many others, would be deemed unqualified for the court simply because they have dared to substantively and courageously engage the issues of their time. Would Thurgood Marshall or Ruth Bader Ginsburg be nominated under this current framework? One wonders whether a game that promotes politics over principle is worth the candle. Ed Whelan, a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit organization that describes itself as an ""institute dedicated to applying the Judeo-Christian moral tradition to critical issues of public policy."" He served during President George W. Bush's first term as principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel in the U.S. Department of Justice: . President Obama claimed he was searching for a Supreme Court justice who would protect the concerns of American citizens. By that standard, Elena Kagan is a very strange pick. While American soldiers were fighting Islamic terrorists abroad and defending our national security, Elena Kagan kicked military recruiters off the Harvard law school campus. In doing so, she elevated her own ideology above what Congress, acting on the advice of military leaders, had determined best served the interests of national security. Kagan has no judicial experience, hardly any real-world legal experience and a scant record of legal scholarship. She's been adept at cultivating the powerful, as her paid role as a Goldman Sachs adviser shows. Her primary advantages over the other contenders for the nomination were that she's an Obama insider and that she's largely succeeded in hiding her legal views. Her nomination deserves rigorous scrutiny. Renée M. Landers, faculty director and professor of law at Suffolk University Law School in Boston, Massachusetts: . The nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan for the Supreme Court reflects President Obama's characteristic preference for caution and conciliation rather than political confrontation in dealings with Congress. First, the president is calculating that it will be difficult for the same senators who voted recently to confirm Kagan as solicitor general to decide that she should not be confirmed as an associate justice on the Supreme Court. Second, even though she does not have judicial experience like every other sitting member of the court -- and while if confirmed, she would become only the fourth woman to serve on the court -- in educational background and her work as a law professor and presidential appointee, Kagan's experience will not add diversity to the court. Third, her views of presidential power (expressed in her writings and particularly in the path that the Obama administration has pursued on the Guantanamo detainees and on trials for those suspected of ties to terrorist organizations) would not seem to cause concerns among senators on national security grounds. As solicitor general, however, Kagan recently declined to pursue an appeal in Limone v. United States, the case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld a damages award of more than $100 million to four men who spent decades in prison because the FBI framed them for a murder they did not commit. Two of the men died in prison. Kagan's decision indicates not only a careful review of the law, but the implicit judgment that the government cannot use any and all means in pursuit of its law enforcement objectives, especially when those means involve a deliberate disregard for the rights of innocent individuals. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the authors.","Obama has nominated Solicitor General Elena Kagan to fill empty Supreme Court seat .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama is ""very concerned"" about Greece's economic crisis, sees mounting threats against the United States from non-state actors and wants to resolve the dispute with Russia over adoptions, he said in an interview released Saturday by the White House. ""I am very concerned about what's happening in Europe,"" Obama told the Russian television station Channel Rossiya in the wide-ranging interview, responding to a question about the Greek economic crisis. ""But I think it is an issue that the Europeans recognize is very serious,"" he said. ""Greece is taking some very difficult measures -- at least they've put forward a plan that calls for difficult measures."" This week, Greek lawmakers approved a package of budget-cutting measures to help the country's battered economy -- measures that were required to meet the terms of a 110 billion euro ($140 billion) bailout. European Union leaders called for a ""stabilization mechanism"" on Saturday in hopes of easing markets shaken by Greece's economic crisis before they re-open Monday. Obama said the Greek crisis and the resulting global economic fallout point to a new breed of non-state-based threats facing the United States and other powerful nations. ""The real threats against Russian well-being or U.S. well-being to a large degree are at this point much more aligned than they've ever been, "" Obama said in the interview, which was taped Thursday at the White House. ""It has to do with non-state actors. ""It has to do with the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It has to do with environmental catastrophes. It has to do with an integrated economy in which if you see a crisis in Greece taking place, that can affect world markets."" Obama invoked terrorism as another of those threats. ""We just recently had an attempted terrorist act in New York,"" he said, referring to the failed car bombing of Times Square last Saturday, ""and it's a signal I think that whether these activities are happening in Moscow or they're happening in New York, that countries have to work together to make sure that these terrorists are apprehended, that their networks are destroyed, that their sources of financing dry up."" Speaking about U.S.-Russia relations, Obama said he wants the U.S. Senate to ratify a major nuclear arms treaty between the United States and Russia before November's midterm elections. President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- known as START -- in April. The agreement reduces the number of nuclear weapons held by the United States and Russia by about one-third, among other provisions. ""Our hope,"" Obama said in the interview, is that the Senate ""will be able to review it quickly."" Speaking further about international nuclear arms reduction, Obama called North Korea and Iran ""two outliers"" but said he's ""very heartened"" by other nations' receptivity to his call for new sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. Obama also said that U.S. and Russian officials are working toward an agreement regarding American adoptions of Russian children after an uproar last month over a Tennessee woman sending a 7-year-old Russian boy she adopted back to his home country. Russia said it was freezing American adoptions of Russian children after the incident, but a senior State Department official said this week that Russian authorities continue to approve U.S. adoptions. ""What happened with the small number of children who have been adversely affected is terrible,"" Obama said. ""And we can't minimize what's happened."" But Obama said that ""there have been tens of thousands of Russian children adopted by U.S. families. The overwhelming majority are leading happy, healthy lives."" ""We want to make sure that we preserve the best of the system while eliminating these abuses,"" he said. Obama spoke in personal terms about his relationship with Medvedev, the Russian president. ""I've been very impressed with him,"" Obama said. ""I think he is a strong leader, a good man, very thoughtful."" ""I find it very easy to do business with him, and I think we've established a relationship, a real trust that can be hopefully bearing fruit in the negotiations and conversations that we have in years to come."" Obama said that he had invited Medvedev to visit the United States in June and that he hoped the trip would showcase steps the United States and Russia are taking to strengthen economic ties between the two nations. ""It's important to recognize that the whole concept of reset between U.S. and Russian relations is not just on issues of security,"" Obama said. ""One of the things that President Medvedev and I have discussed is how can we really ramp up our commercial, our trade, our economic ties.""","President Obama troubled by Greece's economic woes .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Marie, a Haitian mother, couldn't have been more grateful. ""Thank you God for TPS,"" she recently told an attorney helping her fill out forms that will protect her from deportation. She was referring to temporary protected status, which will allow her to work legally, help Haiti and support her two young children. It's the sentiment that we hear most these days. As longtime advocates, we at Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center  were gratified when the Department of Homeland Security  granted temporary protected status to unauthorized Haitian immigrants after the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti. Temporary protected status will allow perhaps 100,000 Haitians to legalize their status for the next 18 months. They'll be able get work permits and driver's licenses and send more money to loved ones struggling in Haiti's ruins. Such people-to-people help is one of the best forms of foreign aid. Remittances encourage Haitians to stay and rebuild Haiti, rather than attempt treacherous sea voyages that more often than not end in tragedy. Today, Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center and other pro bono groups are working furiously to help Haitians apply for temporary protected status and warn them away from ""raketè,"" scammers who will rip them off. It's a mammoth job in South Florida, home of the nation's largest Haitian-born population. The six-page temporary protected status application includes complicated questions and must be translated for non-English speakers. Many Haitians also need help filling out work-permit and fee-waiver forms. Without a waiver, applicants ages 14 to 65 must pay $470 in fees and $50 for a younger child. Frankly, temporary protected status is the least our government can do after decades of denying Haitians just immigration treatment. No previous administration had granted temporary protected status to Haitians despite numerous occasions when deportees would have been unsafe due to political conflict or natural disasters, conditions that typically trigger temporary protected status. Indeed, we had been actively pushing for temporary protected status since four killer storms demolished 15 percent of Haiti's gross domestic product in late 2008. The history of discriminatory treatment goes back much further. Since Haitians started coming to U.S. shores nearly 50 years ago, they routinely have been denied the fundamental protections promised to refugees of virtually every other nationality. Finally more attention is being paid to the need to help the Haitians. As a key neighbor, the United States needs to prepare for a long-term commitment in which U.S. Haitians play a key role. Many of these Haitians wish to travel to support relatives in Haiti and contribute to reconstruction. But for Haitians with temporary protected status, those trips could lead to dire consequences. Though they may travel legally, some may face problems coming back home and, thus, should consult with an attorney before leaving. Many U.S. citizen and resident Haitians also are trying desperately to bring relatives here from Haiti, but some face daunting delays because of archaic immigration processes. Given the substantial moral and material help that Haitians in our country offer Haiti, Homeland Security should find solutions to permit travel and expedite relative reunification. We are hopeful, too, that Homeland Security will address concerns regarding Haitians who have arrived here since the earthquake with no or improper visas. One glaring example is the dozens of Haitians who were flown here on military planes after the earthquake, only to be detained. Many lost their parents, siblings and children; one of our clients lost his twin 9-year old daughters. Virtually all had U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident relatives awaiting their release. Their prolonged detention only exacerbated the terrible trauma they suffered before fleeing Haiti. During their detention, most showed signs of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center's attempts to get permission for a psychotherapist to meet with the Haitians were repeatedly rebuffed. When everyone in the world was offering to help the Haitians, Immigration and Customs Enforcement kept our clients in detention for more than two months. They only released them after a front page New York Times story ran and the Haitians agreed to be deported whenever ICE wants. Haitian orphans also raise tough questions. While many caring Americans would like to adopt, there is real danger that Haitian children may be trafficked or improperly separated from their parents. For this and other thorny problems, no easy solutions exist in the midst of Haiti's crisis. This crisis in fact has exposed cracks in our deeply fractured immigration system. We know Haiti will not be ready for an influx of deportees when temporary protected status expires in July 2011 or for a long time to come. Frankly, this country wouldn't have large populations of immigrants who need temporary protected status if we adjusted immigration flows to meet the real demands of its families and our economy. The best solution would be for Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform that includes a legalization plan and future immigrant flows attuned to the needs of our labor markets. The path to legal status should be offered, not only to Haitians, but also to millions of unauthorized immigrants without criminal records, who pay taxes, raise U.S. citizen kids and have contributed to their communities for years. Reform that calibrates incoming immigration flows to labor needs and ensures workers rights would raise wages throughout the U.S. economy. Such immigration reform could add $1.5 trillion to the nation's GDP over 10 years, according to a study released in February by the think tanks Center for American Progress and Immigration Policy Center. Clearly, enforcement-only immigration policy is not enough. Piecemeal fixes have not worked. The United States needs a 21st century immigration system that will benefit all Americans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cheryl Little.","Cheryl Little says giving protected status to Haitian immigrants was wise .

"(CNN) -- Legendary singer, dancer, actress and civil rights activist Lena Horne, 92, died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. No other details of her death were made public. Horne was the first African-Americans to sign a long-term movie contract with a major Hollywood studio when she joined MGM in 1942. Horne's expressive and silky voice made her a singing star, known best for her hit ""Stormy Weather,"" after Hollywood failed to give her roles that might have made her a big screen starlet. Horne complained she was used as ""window dressing"" in white films, mostly limited to singing performances that could be easily edited out for play in southern theaters. The light-complexioned Horne refused to go along with studio plans to promote her as a Latin American. She later said she did not want to be ""an imitation of a white woman."" Horne, whose parents divorced when she was 3, lived a nomadic childhood traveling with her actress mother. She spent much of her time growing up in Brooklyn, New York, where she was born in 1917. Horne was 16 when she began her show business career as a dancer at Harlem's Cotton Club. She later became a singer there, playing to packed houses of white patrons, with band leaders Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. She began taking singing lessons in 1935, and eventually landed a part in the all-black Broadway production ""Dance With Your Gods."" Her work as a feature singer with touring bands and in nightclubs increased. She became the first African-American singer to tour with a white group in 1940, according to her official biography. Her first film role came in 1938 in ""The Duke is Tops,"" but her next movie didn't come along for another four years. She was given a screen test by MGM and signed to a seven-year movie contract after a studio scout saw her performing in a New York club. Her stepfather, Miguel Rodriguez, negotiated with MGM head Louis B. Mayer for her to never be cast as a maid or ""Tarzan extra."" ""I think the black boy that cleaned the shoes and me were the only two black people except the maids who were there working for the stars,"" Horne said in a CNN interview. ""And it was very lonely and I wasn't very happy."" Still, Horne said she was grateful that her World War II era films -- including black musicals ""Cabin in the Sky"" and ""Stormy Weather"" -- were seen by black and white soldiers. ""But after I realized I would only go so far, I went on the stage,"" Horne said. With only subservient roles available for a black actress in Hollywood in the 1940s, Horne turned to recording top-selling songs. Horne said performing for live audiences was what she loved most. ""I'm always happy when I'm surrounded by people to react and feel and touch,"" she said. While traveling with a USO tour during the World War II, she walked out on a show because German war prisoners were seated in front seats, ahead of African-American troops. After the USO withdrew her from the tour, she used her own money to travel to sing for the troops. She has a son and daughter from a first marriage that ended in 1944. Horne married again in 1947 to Lennie Hayton, who was then MGM's music director. She kept the marriage secret for several years, since Hayton was white. When it was made public, the couple received hate mail and threats of violence, according to her biography. Radio, television, film and nightclub jobs were harder for Horne to find in the McCarthy era of the 1950s when she was blacklisted. That ended in 1956 when RCA gave Horne a new recording contract and she earned a guest spot in the movie ""Meet Me in Las Vegas."" Horne returned to Broadway in 1957 for her first starring role there. ""Jamaica"" ran for 555 shows. She became active in the civil rights movement after she was involved in a public altercation following a racial slur in a Beverly Hills, California, restaurant in 1960. She was an active supporter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights movement. Horne was there when King delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the Lincoln Memorial steps in 1963. Variety television shows welcomed Horne as a musical performer, especially in the 1960s. She appeared on numerous episodes with Perry Como, Dean Martin and Flip Wilson. She returned to film for a final role in 1978 as Glinda the Good Witch, opposite Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, in ""The Wiz,"" an adaptation of ""The Wizard of Oz."" She got a special Tony Award for her 1981 one-woman Broadway hit ""Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music."" She also won two Grammys for the recording of the show. Horne was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, and she also won a Grammy in 1995 for best jazz vocal performance for her album ""An Evening With Lena Horne."" In her later years, Horne said she found peace. ""The best time in my life I guess is now because I'm quiet and I'm logical and I accept without flying off the handle -- sometimes I do,"" Horne said with a laugh.","She was one of the first African-Americans to sign a long-term movie contract .

"(CNN)  -- Roma captain Francesco Totti scored two late goals as his side beat Cagliari 2-1 to ensure the Serie A title race goes down to the last week. But treble-chasing Inter Milan edged out Chievo 4-3 to hold a two-point lead going into the final round. Andrea Lazzari gave Cagliari the lead with a 73rd minute strike from a free kick but Tottie soon had Roma level in the Stadio Olimpico with a neat turn and shot. An 83rd minute penalty from Totti wrapped up three points in a dramatic turnaround. Inter also lived dangerously at the San Siro after a late Chievo fightback led to a nervy finish for Jose Mourinho's men. Thiago Motta's own goal gave the visitors the lead before Andrea Mantovani also put through his own net to see Inter level. Esteban Cambiasso, Diego Milito and Mario Balotelli then scored further goals for Inter who were in total command until late strikes from Pablo Granoche and Sergio Pellissier for battling Chievo. Inter must now beat lowly Siena in their final match to wrap up the title as they bid for a Champions League, Italian Cup and Serie A treble. ""We have a true final at Siena,"" said Inter's top scorer Diego Milito. ""We have two days to rest and then we will prepare for this game."" AC Milan's poor end to the season continued as they were beaten 1-0 at Genoa. Giuseppe Sculli's 56th-minute goal settled the match while Milan, who will finish third, had Mathieu Flamini sent-off in the closing moments. The battle for the fourth place and final Champions League spot will also go to the last weekend after fifth-placed Palermo and fourth-placed Sampdoria drew 1-1 in Sicily. Samp went ahead against Palermo through a Giampaolo Pazzini penalty in the second half but Fabrizio Miccoli equalized from the spot as well with 20 minutes left. Like Roma, they are two points adrift with a game remaining. In other action on Sunday, Atalanta's relegation was confirmed with their 2-0 defeat at Napoli with two goals from Fabio Quagliarella. Siena and Livorno were already down. Juventus's 3-2 defeat at home to Parma continued their poor season with a record 14th Serie A defeat and the match was marred by crowd trouble. The defeat ensures Juve will finish in seventh place and have to play in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League next season.","Inter Milan beat Chievo 4-3 to stay two points clear of AS Roma in Serie A .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's ailing President Umaru Yar'Adua, who gave amnesty to armed militants in the troubled oil-rich Niger Delta region, died Wednesday, the country's information minister said. He was 58. Yar'Adua had not been seen in public since November, when he went to Saudi Arabia for treatment of an inflammation of tissue around his heart. He was diagnosed with that condition, acute pericarditis, last fall after he complained of chest pain. He returned to Nigeria in February but had remained out of sight. Vice President Goodluck Jonathan has served as the country's acting leader since Yar'Adua fell ill. Yar'Adua took office in 2007 in an election mired in controversy and accusations of vote-rigging. ""There was ballot snatching, voters were molested, voters were beaten ... and also payment inducement to vote for certain candidates,"" said Eneruvie Enakoko of the Civil Liberties Organization, a human rights group in Lagos. The president, a soft-spoken and unassuming figure who did not bask in the media spotlight like past leaders of the West African nation, pledged to fight to improve the country of 150 million people despite the accusations. ""Our collective goal is to deliver for our children a Nigeria better, stronger, more peaceful, more secure and more prosperous than we met it,"" Yar'Adua said. President Barack Obama issued a statement late Wednesday expressing his condolences to Yar'Adua's family and the Nigerian people. ""President Yar'Adua worked to promote peace and stability in Africa through his support of Nigerian peacekeeping efforts as well as his strong criticism of undemocratic actions in the region,"" Obama said in the statement. ""He was committed to creating lasting peace and prosperity within Nigeria's own borders, and continuing that work will be an important part of honoring his legacy."" His election followed wide support from his predecessor, leading critics to label him a puppet of the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. After he was elected, Yar'Adua replaced some of Obasanjo's top officials, including the head of the army, a move analysts said was aimed at shedding off his predecessor's influence. One of Yar'Adua's biggest successes was offering amnesty to militants in the troubled oil-rich Niger Delta region, a move that brought fragile peace to the area after years of conflict. The well-armed Niger Delta rebels have been battling Nigeria's armed forces over oil profits, which they say are unequally distributed. While he has hospitalized in Saudi Arabia, the militants called off the truce, dealing a blow to plans to end violence that has crippled oil production in the nation. Analysts say he did little to institutionalize reform in a country where two-thirds of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. ""Because many people feel disillusioned economically and as long as they have those sentiments -- I think the risk of radical uprisings in places like northern Nigeria and certainly southern Nigeria in the Delta will continue regardless of who is in power,"" said Rolake Akinola, an analyst at Control Risks West Africa. Yar'Adua, a former chemistry teacher, was married twice and has nine children. CNN's Faith Karimi and Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Nigeria's information minister says President Umaru Yar'Adua has died .

"New York (CNN) -- Lil' Wayne was sentenced Monday to a year in prison. The rapper, whose legal name is Dwayne Carter, pleaded guilty in October to felony gun charges as part of a deal with prosecutors. The charges stem from his arrest in 2007 outside New York City's Beacon Theater. According to police, Carter had a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. His attorney said it belonged to someone else. His sentencing was delayed twice -- first so he could get dental work done, including removal of his diamond-studded braces, then because of a fire at a Manhattan courthouse. At Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday, the room was packed with onlookers, while more people crowded outside. Carter was offered the chance to make a statement but declined, shaking his head. His attorney requested that Carter have protective custody while he is incarcerated. The attorney also requested medical attention because of his recent dental surgery. As Carter was leaving the courtroom, a fan said to him, ""Keep your head up, Weezy,"" using the rapper's nickname. Another man wore a T-shirt that said ""Free Weezy."" Carter also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in Arizona. Lil' Wayne is a multiplatinum-selling and Grammy-winning rap artist. His hits include ""The Block is Hot"" and ""Lollipop."" His album ""Tha Carter III"" was the top selling disc of 2008. His latest album, ""Rebirth,"" was released last month.

"(CNN) -- Togo may be allowed to take part in the next African Nations Cup after world soccer's governing body FIFA stepped in to mediate the row arising from the team's withdrawal from this year's event. The Togo Football Federation was fined $50,000 and excluded from the 2012 and 2014 tournaments after pulling out ahead ahead of the start of the Angola edition in January due to a deadly gun attack on the team's bus. National captain Emmanuel Adebayor decided to quit international football due to the trauma of the incident, which saw rebels fire on his players and kill three people. Togo appealed the Confederation of Africa Football's decision to the Sport of Arbitration for Court, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter subsequently brought in to mediate the hearing. As a result, the president of the CAF, Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, will ask the African ruling body's executive committee to lift the ban at its next meeting on May 15. As part of the deal, the TFF admitted that it had not complied with CAF competition regulations when it withdrew the team, known as the Sparrow Hawks. ""I am very pleased that we have been able to find a solution which is satisfactory for both parties,"" Blatter said in a statement on Friday. ""Today marks a victory for the whole football family, particularly for African football. This shows that we can solve internal disputes within the football family for the benefit of all those who are involved in our game, and in particular for the players."" The CAS, an independent tribunal that deals with sports disputes, was also relieved that it had been able to broker a deal. ""Considering the emotional circumstances surrounding this case, it was very important for the parties to find a reasonable solution in order to put an end to their dispute,"" Secretary General Matthieu Reeb said.","Confederation of Africa Football's president will ask for Togo's suspension to be lifted .

"Pensacola, Florida (CNN) -- As the ""H2O Below"" charter boat leaves the dock and heads into Pensacola Bay, it is chock full of divers. But there's not a single paying client aboard. The boat is carrying a team of local dive industry professionals -- along with an underwater cameraman -- who arranged Wednesday's trip to show that the Gulf oil spill has not affected the prized dive site, the USS Oriskany. ""We're going to go out look at the ship, assess the marine life on it and find that there's no oil anywhere around,"" said Jim Phillips, who owns a dive shop in the area. Aside from its beautiful white sand beaches, Pensacola is home to the only aircraft carrier that has been turned into an artificial reef. Divers travel from all over the world to see the USS Oriskany not just because it's the world's largest manmade reef.  The ""Great Carrier Reef"" as it is sometimes called is also an important piece of history. ""It has a long history in the Korean War [and] it was also the last piece of American soil that [U.S. Senator] John McCain saw before he was shot down,"" said Douglas Hammock, the owner and captain of H2O. McCain's aircraft flew off of the Oriskany in 1967 before it was shot down during a bombing mission over Hanoi, Vietnam.  McCain was held as a prisoner of war until 1973. A year before McCain's mission, the USS Oriskany suffered an onboard fire that killed 44 sailors -- one of the worst fires to engulf a ship since World War II. In 2006, the ship was purposely sunk in an upright position to create the reef, which has attracted nearly 40 different species of fish. The $20 million project was intended not only to serve as a habitat for marine life, but also to boost tourism in the Pensacola region. Now, the historical dive site is threatened by the leaking oil rig more than 100 miles away that continues to spew an estimated 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude into the Gulf every day. Phillips said he's been assuring his customers that, as of now, there is no need to cancel their scheduled dive trips to the USS Oriskany, which is about an hour-long boat ride from the shore. ""The marine life in our area I'll put it up against anywhere in the world as far as the quantity and quality and variety,"" says Phillips. As of Wednesday afternoon, the oil spill was stretched from the northeast side of the Mississippi Delta to about 60 miles off Pensacola, Florida, according to Charlie Henry of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Phillips said some of his clients have cancelled their dive trips, but most people are just calling and asking about the water conditions. So the Pensacola team plans to post video of Wednesday's dive on the Internet to show people that the oil spill has not impacted this Gulf Coast community. Not yet anyway. No oil was expected to impact the shores of Pensacola beach and beyond through the weekend, Escambia County's disaster response team said Thursday. Wednesday was a perfect day for filming an underwater dive. The Gulf of Mexico looked like a lake, the sun was bright and marine life could be seen as the boat made its way to the dive site. Sea turtles were sunning themselves on the water's surface. A few dolphins jumped in and out of the water. In the air, the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels team flew across the clear blue sky. As the boat anchored at the USS Oriskany site, Hammock calmly waited for the news from the divers.   He had calculated that the oil was still about 90 miles away. Share your stories from after the oil spill . About a half hour after entering the water, the divers emerged. ""How was it?"" Hammock asked. They all had similar answers. The divers say the marine life looked amazing. There were all types of tropical fish on the wreck, as well as the resident octopus, a lot of barracudas, and a sea turtle. Even better news: there were no signs of oil. Hammock is encouraged by the news, but repeated the words of so many business owners on the Gulf Coast. ""This oil will be devastating to us,"" he said. ""If this oil shows up here it will definitely shut down a big industry in the panhandle.""","Local divers assessing the waters off Pensacola, Florida for oil .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Just days before his death, the Brooklyn, New York, middle-school student who died from an antibiotic-resistant staph infection had visited a hospital with skin lesions and was treated with allergy medicine, according to the family's lawyer, Paul Weitz. Omar Rivera, 12, a New York seventh-grader, died of drug-resistant staph on October 14. Omar Rivera's mother, Aileen, took the 12-year-old boy to Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn because she had been dissatisfied with the treatment he received at a clinic, Weitz told CNN. He said the hospital treated him with Benadryl, a common anti-allergy medicine. According to hospital spokeswoman Hope Mason, Omar did not show signs of a staph infection when he was treated at the hospital. ""I can confirm the child was brought to the emergency room after midnight on Friday, October 12. He was treated for non-MRSA-related conditions and was released,"" said Mason. ""We will be closely examining whether more could have been done to detect the infection at that time."" MRSA is short for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and is responsible for more deaths in the United States each year than AIDS, according to new data. The germ resists all but the most powerful antibiotics. Omar, a seventh-grader at Intermediate School 211, was pronounced dead on October 14 at Brookdale Hospital. Twenty-five to 30 percent of the population carry the staph bacteria -- one of the most common causes of infection -- in their bodies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While such infections are typically minor, invasive MRSA infections can become fatal, because they are caused by drug-resistant staph. E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama tapped a former Army general Monday to lead the Transportation Security Administration. Obama nominated Robert A. Harding, a retired major general with 33 years in the Army, to become the TSA administrator. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the nomination with Harding by her side. ""The TSA administrator is among the most important, unfilled posts in the Obama administration,"" Napolitano said. ""The president and I both believe that Gen. Harding has the experience and perspective to make a real difference in carrying out the mission of this agency."" ""If there were ever a nominee that warranted expedited, and detailed, consideration in the Senate, this is it,"" she said. Obama announced the nomination in a White House news release. ""I am confident that Bob's talent and expertise will make him a tremendous asset in our ongoing efforts to bolster security and screening measures at our airports,"" Obama said. ""I can think of no one more qualified than Bob to take on this important job, and I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead."" The TSA has been under the leadership of an acting administrator since Edmund ""Kip"" Hawley resigned at the end of the Bush administration. In September, Obama nominated Erroll Southers, a Los Angeles airport police department official, to the head the agency. But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, spearheaded GOP efforts to block the nomination based on concerns Southers would unionize airport screeners. Southers withdrew his nomination in January after lawmakers questioned his changing explanation about a personnel action taken against him decades ago. Harding would be the TSA's first African-American administrator. Southers is also black. Harding has served as CEO of Harding Security Associates, a defense and intelligence government contracting firm he founded in 2003 and sold in July 2009. From 1996 to 2000, Harding was director for operations at the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he was the Defense Department's senior human intelligence officer. Before that, he was director for intelligence for the Army's Southern Command. The TSA was created in the months after the September 11, 2001, attacks and soon took over security at the nation's airports, including screening commercial airline passengers and luggage.

"(CNN) -- Tuesday marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" on November 24, 1859. All 1,250 copies of the initial print run of the book were scooped up by readers eager to see the British naturalist going rogue with his radical new theory of evolution, ""By Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life,"" in the book's full title. How important is this book? Thomas Henry Huxley (""Darwin's bulldog"") proclaimed that ""On the Origin of Species"" was ""the most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of knowledge which has come into man's hands since Newton's 'Principia,' "" and lamented to himself: ""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that."" The Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr, arguably the greatest evolutionary theorist since Darwin, asserted: ""It would be difficult to refute the claim that the Darwinian revolution was the greatest of all intellectual revolutions in the history of mankind."" The Harvard paleontologist and historian of science Stephen Jay Gould called the theory of evolution one of the half dozen most important ideas in the entire history of Western thought. Why, then, do so many Americans not accept the theory of evolution? A 2001 Gallup Poll found that 45 percent of Americans agree with the statement ""God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so,"" while 37 percent preferred a blended belief that ""Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God guided this process,"" and a paltry 12 percent accepted the standard scientific theory that ""Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process."" These percentages have remained largely unchanged in subsequent surveys, although most scientists would prefer that the questions were asked without reference to God since the science of evolutionary biology stands or falls on its own whether God directed the process or not, or even if there is a God or not. There are at least six reasons that make people resistant to accepting evolution. 1. The Warfare Model of Science and Religion. The belief that there is a war between science and religion where one is right and the other wrong, and that one must choose one over the other. 2. Belief that evolution is a threat to specific religious tenets. Many people attempt to use science to prove certain religious tenets, but when they do not appear to fit, the science is rejected. For example, the attempt to prove that the Genesis creation story is accurately reflected in the geological fossil record has led many creationists to conclude that the Earth was created within the past 10,000 years, which is in sharp contrast to the geological evidence for a 4.6 billion-year-old Earth. 3. Misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. A significant problem is that most people know so little about the theory. In the 2001 Gallup Poll, for example, a quarter of the people surveyed said they didn't know enough to say whether they accepted evolution or not, and only 34 percent considered themselves to be ""very informed"" about the theory. Because evolution is so controversial, public school science teachers typically drop the subject entirely rather than face the discomfort aroused among students and parents. 4. The fear that evolution degrades our humanity. After Copernicus toppled the pedestal of our cosmic centrality, Darwin delivered the coup de grâce by revealing us to be ""mere"" animals, subject to the same natural laws and historical forces as all other animals. 5. The equation of evolution with ethical nihilism. This sentiment was expressed by the neoconservative social commentator Irving Kristol in 1991: ""If there is one indisputable fact about the human condition it is that no community can survive if it is persuaded -- or even if it suspects -- that its members are leading meaningless lives in a meaningless universe."" 6. The fear that evolutionary theory implies we have a fixed human nature. The first five reasons for the resistance to evolutionary theory come almost exclusively from political conservatives. This last reason originates from liberals who fear that the application of evolutionary theory to human thought and action implies that political policy and economic doctrines will fail because the constitution of humanity is stronger than the constitutions of states. All of these fears are baseless. If one is a theist, it should not matter when God made the universe -- 10,000 years ago or 10 billion years ago. The difference of six zeros is meaningless to an omniscient and omnipotent being, and the glory of divine creation cries out for praise regardless of when it happened. Likewise, it should not matter how God created life, whether it was through a miraculous spoken word or through the natural forces of the universe that He created. The grandeur of God's works commands awe regardless of what processes He used. As for meanings and morals, it is here where our humanity arises from our biology. We evolved as a social primate species with the tendency of being cooperative and altruistic within our own groups, but competitive and bellicose between groups. The purpose of civilization is to help us rise above our hearts of darkness and to accentuate the better angels of our nature. Believers should embrace science, especially evolutionary theory, for what it has done to reveal the magnificence of the divinity in a depth never dreamed by our ancient ancestors. We have learned a lot in 4,000 years, and that knowledge should never be dreaded or denied. Instead, science should be welcomed by all who cherish human understanding and wisdom. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Shermer.","Shermer wonders why so many Americans don't accept the theory of evolution .
He comes up with six reasons why not, including misunderstanding and fear .
But he says, divine creation cries out for praise regardless of when it happened ."
(CNN) -- AC Milan and Roma played out a goalless draw in Italy's Serie A in a result which does little to enhance the title ambitions of neither side. The result left Inter Milan three points clear at the top of the table and they will be able to increase that lead to six if they claim victory over Genoa at the San Siro on Sunday night. Roma began the brighter of the two sides and Cristian Abiatti saved well from a Julio Baptista shot while Daniele De Rossi screwed a shot wide when well placed. The visitors were much improved after the half-time break and controlled possession but were unable to create many chances although Marco Borriello squandered a good chance when he opted to shoot instead of passing to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. John-Arne Riise's dangerous cross was met by the head of Mirko Vucinic in the 74th minute but the Montenegro striker was unable to direct his attempt on goal. Brazilian Ronaldinho also went close with a header from David Beckham's cross in the dying stages as the match ended in a stalemate. In Saturday's other game Juventus moved back into the top four in Serie A thanks to a narrow 2-1 victory over Fiorentina at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. The Turin giants were under pressure following a defeat to Palermo last weekend and coach Alberto Zaccheroni got the response he requested from his players. Juventus took the lead through Brazilian playmaker Diego in only the second minute of the game when he took the ball round Fiorentina goalkeeper Sebastian Frey and fired home after collecting an intelligent through-ball from Antonio Candreva. Fiorentina responded positively and gained a deserved equalizer when former Juventus midfielder Marco Marchionni headed past stand-in goalkeeper Alex Manninger in the 32nd minute. Marchionni then missed a chance to put his side ahead moments before the break when he fired a shot when well placed inside the penalty area. Juventus improved after the interval and David Trezeguet tested Frey with a volley before the visitors took the lead for the second time in the 68th minute when Fabio Grosso crashed a shot into the top corner. Zaccheroni's side could have extended their advantage in injury time but a superb double save from Frey denied Claudio Marchisio.,"AC Milan and Roma played out a goalless draw in Italy's Serie A .

"(CNN) -- The LPGA have confirmed that 25-year-old golfer Erica Blasberg has been found dead. Blasberg has played on the LPGA Tour since 2004, and had recently participated in her first event of 2010 in Mexico where she tied for 44th in the Tres Marias Championship. A native of California, Blasberg turned professional in 2004 and claimed one victory on the Duramed Futures Tour before qualifying for the LPGA Tour in 2005. Blasberg's best performance was in 2008 when she recorded a joint eighth position at the SBS Open in Hawaii -- a career-best -- and claimed over $113,000 prize money. The details of her death are not yet known, according to the LPGA. Blasberg's agent, Chase Callahan of REP 1 Sports Group told the LPGA's official Web site: ""We are devastated to learn of the passing of Erica Blasberg. ""To most of the world, Erica was known as a professional golfer, but she was more than that. She was a loving daughter to her parents and a compassionate and loyal friend. ""Erica had a good heart, was extremely kind and very thankful for what she had in her life. She lived out her dream of playing professional golf on the highest level on the LPGA Tour, allowing her to help inspire others. ""We are proud of Erica for everything she accomplished.

"Washington (CNN) -- As a young working mother in the the early 1980s, Diane Wood, like many of her generation, struggled to balance work and family. The future judge and Supreme Court contender had just accepted a job teaching law in Chicago, Illinois, while pregnant with her second child. Soon after David was born, the professor went into anaphylactic shock and was rushed to the hospital with post-pregnancy complications. Despite her serious condition, she recovered quickly, but really had no choice. Friends say that with two young kids and a new job, no maternity leave was offered, and her male colleagues at work were mostly clueless over how to deal with her. ""People had no idea what to do with the fact that I had these two tiny children,"" she told an interviewer last year. Overcoming institutional and social challenges to become a nationally recognized legal heavyweight and high court contender, colleagues say, is a testament to Wood's intellectual and personal fortitude. Her long, relatively liberal judicial record presents both a measure of certainty about the kind of justice she would become, and a political challenge getting her confirmed. ""Diane Wood is among the most respected federal judges on the left,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a Supreme Court legal analyst and founder of scotusblog.com. ""Being a woman is a political plus, but she has decided cases on abortion, affirmative action, religion, and the like. That will generate more of a political firestorm."" Wood has sat on the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago since 1995. Considered one of the sharpest minds on that bench, she has known President Obama from their days as part-time instructors at the University of Chicago. They have remained casual friends since then. She will turn 60 in July and is among the oldest candidates being given serious scrutiny for the high court. Aware of her liberalism, progressive groups have been quietly urging the White House to nominate Wood, saying she also enjoys the support of conservative members of her court, and would be confirmable. Wood was born in 1950 in New Jersey, and as a teenager moved with her parents to Texas, where her father worked as an Exxon accountant. After finishing first in her class at Houston's Westchester High School, Wood had her choice of colleges, including the Ivy Leagues, but chose in-state University of Texas, mainly due to financial considerations. She was weeks from beginning graduate studies in literature at Yale when, on a whim, she pulled out and decided to take up law at UT, where her future husband was studying. If nominated and confirmed to the high court, she would be the only person on that bench without an Ivy League law degree, and the only Protestant. She clerked for Justice Harry Blackmun in 1976-77, just three years after he issued the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. She was one of only three female Supreme Court law clerks that year. She later worked as a government lawyer in the administrations of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. In between were brief stints in private practice and as a law professor at Georgetown and the University of Chicago, where she started in 1981 as the only full-time female faculty member. She later became associate dean and helped craft the school's first sexual harassment policy, which took several years to implement. ""You put your batting helmet on when you go to work for the University of Chicago,"" Wood said last year. ""It's a hard-hitting place."" The retiring Justice John Paul Stevens also attended the school as an undergraduate, and Wood still teaches a class in civil procedure on a part-time basis. Students privately describe her courses as tough but very fair, and say Professor Wood is a knowledgeable, hands-on teacher and good listener. Twice divorced with three grown children, Wood is now married to a neurologist and lives in a Chicago suburb. Judge Richard Posner, a conservative member of the 7th Circuit and a close Wood friend, officiated at her 2006 wedding. Friends describe her as keenly interested in world affairs, and she has traveled the globe extensively promoting American concepts of the rule of law. She has made international trade her legal specialty; she speaks French, German, and some Russian. Among her many interests are the oboe and French horn, and she is good enough to play in several area orchestras. Wood's judicial record reflects a mainstream liberal jurisprudence, tempered by a respect for precedent and a narrow focus on the facts at hand. Absent are any detours into ideological rants and asides. In her 15 years on the court, she has often served as an intellectual counterweight to leading conservative judges Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner. She has written more than 50 dissents, and concurrences in dozens more. She became only the second woman at the time to sit on the 7th Circuit, recommended to the job by the late Sen. Paul Simon, D-Illinois. Like many of the top contenders being considered by Obama, Wood has earned a reputation as a consensus-builder on her court. Her rulings on abortion have attracted the most criticism from conservatives. • In 2002, she dissented from a court opinion upholding the constitutionality of an Indiana statute requiring women to wait 18 hours and receive counseling and additional information before obtaining an abortion (A Woman's Choice-East Side Women's Clinic vs. Newman, 2002). • In 1999, she dissented from a ruling upholding the constitutionality of Illinois and Wisconsin statutes banning a late-term procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion (Hope Clinic vs. Ryan, 1999). The high court a year later affirmed her views, throwing out a similar restriction on the procedure in Nebraska. • In 2001, Wood wrote the opinion upholding a lower court decision that applied anti-racketeering laws against a group of anti-abortion protesters. The case was reversed twice by the Supreme Court, 8-1 and 8-0. The only dissent by the high court in support of Wood's views was Stevens himself (National Organization for Women vs. Scheidler, 2001). Wood has expressed admiration for her former boss's views on abortion. ""Justice Blackmun articulated in Roe,"" she wrote in a 1993 law review article, ""the important insight that a core set of individual rights exists that neither the states nor the federal government may trample."" Hours after Stevens announced his retirement in April, abortion opponents made their intentions clear: . ""A Wood nomination would return the abortion wars to the Supreme Court,"" Americans United for Life announced in a statement. ""Judge Diane Wood would be a very polarizing and divisive nominee,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis network. ""She's got cases on abortion, the most extreme abortion cases out there, she's got some very difficult opinions just to square with the American people. And so she is pretty far out on the left. But if that is what the president wants to go for, we are ready for a fight."" Church-state disputes are another area that may cause difficulty if Wood is nominated. • She ruled against a church that claimed O'Hare International Airport's acquisition of church-owned land under eminent domain laws violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment (St. John's United Church of Christ vs. City of Chicago, 2007). • She argued in a dissent that Indiana taxpayers had legal standing to challenge the legislative prayer practices in the Indiana General Assembly (Hinrichs vs. Speaker of the House, 2007). • She issued a dissent in favor of allowing a public university to revoke the charter of a Christian student organization that refused membership to gays and lesbians (Christian Legal Society vs. Walker). The high court last month heard a similar case from the same group, over denial of official recognition by a California law school. And in 2008, she dissented in a ruling allowing a condominium association to prevent a Chicago family from putting up a Jewish decoration on their doorpost. The Blochs challenged the rule against placing ""objects of any sort"" in the hallways. Mezuzahs are often placed on doors, and contain a small parchment with biblical sayings. Wood disagreed with the majority's conclusion the rule was neutral in respect to religion. In a long, detailed dissent, she wrote: ""The [condo] Association might as well hang a sign outside saying 'No Observant Jews Allowed.'"" She also criticized the condo board for filing an appeal accusing the homeowners of trying to get a ""pound of flesh"" from the board. She noted the phrase comes from Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice,"" and refers to the shady actions of Shylock, a Jewish moneylender. ""This is hardly the reference someone should choose who is trying to show that the stand-off ... was not because of the Blochs' religion, but rather in spite of it."" (Bloch v. Frischolz and Shoreline Towers Condominium Assn., 2008). Amazingly, because of her powerful dissent, the entire appeals court agreed to rehear the case and reversed unanimously, adopting Wood's original position. A 2005 law school lecture also raised concerns from conservatives over her views on whether current courts should broadly interpret the original text of the Constitution, and the rights and privileges it confers on citizens. She said of the framers of the 1789 document, ""There is no more reason to think that they expected the world to remain static than there is to think that any of us holds a crystal ball,"" she wrote. ""The only way to create a foundational document that could stand the test of time was to build in enough flexibility that later generations would be able to adapt it to their own needs and uses."" Many conservatives believe judges should adhere to the strict wording of the Constitution, and not try to read into rights that do not exist, such as, they contend, the ""right"" to an abortion. Wood was interviewed by the president last year, a finalist for the high court seat that went to Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Colleagues privately say Wood was pleased with the rapport she established in the one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. She has given few media interviews over the years, and has been generally reticent about stating her views off the bench. When approached by CNN last year in Washington, where she had gone to meet Obama, Wood was polite but firm about her chances. ""I'm not answering anything on that,"" she said, smiling and apologizing she could not say more. In an interview last fall with her alumni magazine, Wood said, ""As a judge you don't campaign for such things. I'm in the luxurious position of knowing that the people who count know that I am here, and if they are interested, they'll let me know.""","Diane Wood has a long, relatively liberal judicial record .

"(CNN) -- The Billings, Montana, City Council will take up the issue of regulating medical marijuana on Monday night in a meeting expected to be intense in the wake of the firebombings of two of the city's medical marijuana storefronts in the last two days. The southern Montana city's dispensaries legally provide marijuana to medical patients who use it for maladies from glaucoma to nausea to lack of appetite. In the latest incidents, the phrase ""Not in our town"" was spray-painted on the businesses, police say. Police Sgt. Kevin Iffland said Big Sky Patient Care was hit early Sunday morning and Montana Therapeutics was the target early Monday. Both had a rock thrown through the front door, followed by a Molotov cocktail. In both cases, Iffland said, the fire was put out swiftly and damage was not extensive. Iffland said Billings police are working with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and that the two firebombs are being handled as felony arsons carrying sentences of up to 20 years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The attacks on the storefronts come as the Billings City Council considers a moratorium on licensing new dispensaries while it works up a regulatory ordinance. Sixty-two percent of Montanans voted in 2004 to allow caregivers to grow marijuana for qualified patients, but the state law said nothing about distribution. In that absence, municipalities and county governments began licensing the establishments on their own. But, Iffland said, Billings was ill-prepared for the number of applications and has very little regulation in place. Billings, he said, is a town of about 100,000 and has had nearly 90 applications for medical marijuana storefronts -- and some residents are angry. He fully expected a heated council meeting. Meanwhile, investigators are still reviewing evidence in the firebombings and are working with one of the businesses that has surveillance video but is reluctant to hand over the tape because of privacy concerns. While the investigation is ongoing, police have stepped up patrols in the areas where the medical marijuana storefronts are located, Iffland said.","""Not in our town"" was spray-painted on the businesses, police say .

"(CNN) -- Tea Party activists and other conservatives are planning rallies next month in support of Arizona's tough new immigration law, which has come under attack from Democrats, Latino groups and some maverick Republicans. But a growing chorus of conservative evangelical leaders has broken with their traditional political allies on the right. They're calling the Arizona law misguided and are attempting to use its passage to push for federal immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The group, which includes influential political activists such as Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's public policy wing, and Mathew Staver, dean of the Liberty University School of Law, will soon begin lobbying Republican leaders in Washington to support comprehensive immigration reform under President Obama. But a big part of their job is to first persuade rank-and-file evangelicals to get on board. ""There's a misconception among people at the grass roots that the pathway to citizenship is amnesty, and it's not, but we have to overcome that,"" said Staver, who heads the law school at the university founded by Jerry Falwell. ""There's a lot of work to be done."" Staver and Land have partnered with the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, an influential Hispanic evangelical figure, and Rick Tyler -- former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's longtime spokesman and head of Gingrich's new values-based organization -- to try to draft a consensus evangelical position on immigration reform. ""After securing our borders, we must allow the millions of undocumented and otherwise law-abiding persons living in our midst to come out of the shadows,"" reads a recent draft of the document, which is still being finalized. ""The pathway for earned legal citizenship or temporary residency should involve a program of legalization for undocumented persons in the United States. ..."" Many conservatives say illegal immigrants should be forced to return to their home countries and start the process of legally coming to the U.S. from scratch. Rodriguez, who heads the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference -- which represents about 16 million Latino evangelicals in the U.S. -- says he'll soon start presenting the document to Republican leaders like Gingrich, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Florida Senate candidate Marco Rubio in hopes that they sign on. ""If the conservative evangelical community looks to the Republican Party and says, 'We demand integration reform, we demand a just assimilation strategy,' that may be the tipping point in getting substantial Republican support for comprehensive immigration reform,"" Rodriguez said. The conservative evangelicals pushing comprehensive immigration reform say that undocumented workers should have to pay fines, clear background checks, learn English and take a civics class before being granted citizenship. Many evangelicals say their push for immigration reform is biblically based, citing passages urging respect for civil laws and concern for migrants and the vulnerable. ""Discussion of immigration and government immigration policy must begin with the truth that every human being is made in the image of God,"" the National Association of Evangelicals said in a recent resolution backing comprehensive immigration reform. ""... Jesus exemplifies respect toward others who are different in his treatment of the Samaritans."" But evangelical leaders are also working to convince Republicans that the party will lose Hispanic voters -- a fast-growing bloc -- if they take a strident line on immigration. The Southern Baptist Convention's Land said that Hispanics, like non-Hispanic white evangelicals, generally take a conservative approach to social issues like abortion and gay marriage, but that they often vote for Democrats because of the immigration issue. ""Hispanics are hard-wired to be like us on sanctity of life, marriage and issues of faith,"" said Land, describing political similarities between Hispanics and white Southern Baptists. ""I'm concerned about being perceived as being unwelcoming to them."" The last time Washington attempted immigration reform, under President George W. Bush in 2007, the project failed, largely because many conservatives and Republicans said the plan's inclusion of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the U.S. was tantamount to amnesty. Most major evangelical groups sat out the 2007 fight over immigration reform, but many, including the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents 30 million Americans, have since taken up the cause. Trying to apply the political lessons of 2007, the evangelical leaders now pushing comprehensive immigration reform stress that the borders need to be secured as part of any reform package. ""I look at the Arizona law as a cry for help from a state that's being inundated as a result of the federal government refusing to enforce its laws,"" Land said. But, he added, ""I think the Arizona law is the wrong way to attack the problem."" Passed last month, the Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question someone about their immigration status if they are in the process of enforcing some other law or ordinance. Critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling, though supporters say a package of changes to the law signed by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer addressed those concerns. Many evangelical leaders promoting comprehensive immigration reform say the law's passage gave new urgency to their campaign, which had been under way since last year. Rodriguez says he declined to join other Latino groups in calling for a boycott of Arizona because he thought it would alienate white evangelicals at a time when he's trying to win their support. Still, Rodriguez and the handful of conservative evangelical leaders promoting comprehensive immigration reform have yet to persuade some of the country's most powerful evangelical groups -- including Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council -- to come on board. ""We've been looking into this deeply but aren't ready to discuss our position, assuming we'll get to one,"" Tom Minnery, vice president of public policy at Focus on the Family, said in an e-mail message last week. Even if such groups join their campaign, evangelicals backing comprehensive immigration reform may face another challenge: Persuading the White House to move forward with the plan after the bruising fight over health care reform.","Some conservative evangelical leaders call Arizona's new immigration law misguided .
They want federal reform that includes path to citizenship for illegal immigrants .
They're trying to persuade rank-and-file evangelicals to get on board .

"Washington (CNN) -- A narrowly passed committee measure that recommends the United States recognize the 1915 killings of ethnic Armenians in Ottoman Turkey as genocide will likely not get a full vote in the House of Representatives, according to a senior State Department official. The official said Friday that the State Department has an understanding with House leadership on the issue, and, ""We believe it will stop where it is."" The measure passed 23-22 in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday. In response, Turkey ordered its ambassador to the United States home for ""consultation,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Burak Ozugergin told CNN. The nearly century-old issue has placed both Congress and the White House in the middle of a political minefield, balancing moral considerations with both domestic and international concerns. The Obama administration had urged the House Foreign Affairs Committee not to pass the resolution, warning it could damage U.S.-Turkish relations and jeopardize efforts to normalize relations between Turkey and its neighbor Armenia. The two do not share formal diplomatic relations. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Friday that ""the Obama administration strongly opposes the resolution that was passed by only one vote in the House committee, and we'll work very hard to make sure it does not go to the House floor."" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters ahead of the vote that the United States was concerned about the impact the vote could potentially have on U.S.-Turkish relations. Turkey, among other things, is considered a strong American ally and is home to a critical U.S. air base. Armenia's foreign minister, Edward Nalbandian, said his country highly appreciates the committee's vote. ""This is another proof of the devotion of the American people to universal human values and is an important step toward the prevention of the crimes against humanity,"" he said. The Armenian National Committee of America said the passage of the measure shows that ""Turkey doesn't get a vote or a veto in the U.S. Congress."" Turkish officials vehemently oppose the measure. ""Turkey is saddened by the bill that has been accepted in the Foreign Affairs Committee today [Thursday],"" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Web site said. ""We condemn this bill that accuses the Turkish nation of a crime it has not committed. The people who support this bill have adopted a wrong and unfair attitude, ignoring the differences of opinion of expert historians and historical facts. The bill has been prepared with tangible historical mistakes regarding the 1915 incidents and with a completely subjective attitude,"" the statement said. A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman recently issued a public warning that passage of a resolution labeling the World War I killings as genocide ""would harm U.S.-Turkish relations."" Turkish officials have also warned that passing the resolution could hurt a historic agreement aimed at normalizing relations between Turkey and Armenia, and efforts to reopen their long-closed border. ""It would harm the normalization process,"" spokesman Ozugergin said. ""And it is wrong. The substance is also wrong."" Turkey officially denies a genocide took place in the last days of the crumbling Ottoman Empire. Ankara instead says that Muslim Turks and Christian Armenians massacred each other on the killing fields of World War I. Historians have extensively documented the Ottoman military's forced death-march of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians into the Syrian desert in 1915. Every April 24, Armenians worldwide observe a remembrance day for those killed. The killings decimated the Armenian population in what is modern-day eastern Turkey. The government in the Armenian capital of Yerevan and influential Armenian diaspora groups have been urging countries around the world to formally label the events of 1915 ""genocide."" ""I don't pretend to be a professional historian,"" Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman, D-California, said ahead of Thursday's vote. ""But the vast majority of experts ... agree that the tragic massacres of the Armenians constitute genocide."" Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-New York, acknowledged that Turkey is an ""important, strong [and] necessary ally of the United States."" But ""overriding all of that,"" he said, ""is the issue of justice and the issue of history. ... History has to be righted."" Opponents of the resolution had expressed sympathy toward the victims of the 1915 killings, but said current political concerns took priority. Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana, praised the committee's ""sincere effort"" to illuminate ""a dark chapter in history,"" but said the committee should not pass the measure. ""I do not minimize the horror that took place,"" he said. But ""now is not the time for this committee of the American Congress to take up the measure that is now before us."" Turkey is a strategic partner of U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Furthermore, the logistical support provided by the U.S. base in Incirlik, Turkey, is a ""staple"" of American power in the Middle East, he asserted. ""In a time of war,"" the United States should not ""take the relationship [with Turkey] for granted."" Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, argued that Congress should not do anything to undermine the Turkish government, which is a ""secular alternative model for the Muslim world."" ""I hate this vote,"" he said. ""The United States has a great deal at stake in the Turkish relationship."" Congress shouldn't ""pontificate on this issue"" and then pretend ""there will be no consequences,"" he warned. Last year, the foreign ministers of Turkey and Armenia signed a series of protocols aimed at establishing embassies in Ankara and Yerevan. The U.S.-, European- and Russian-backed agreement also called for the creation of an international committee of historians to examine archives and ""restore mutual confidence between the two nations."" In October 2009, Armenia's president traveled to Turkey to attend a historic soccer match between the two countries' national teams. Despite this round of ""football diplomacy,"" the diplomatic overture between the two capitals has slowed in recent months. A previous resolution recognizing the Armenian ""genocide"" was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee In 2007. The Turkish government protested by temporarily recalling its ambassador from Washington. The resolution did not make it to the House floor. CNN's Ivan Watson, Elise Labott and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Measure: U.S. should recognize 1915 killings of Armenians in Turkey as genocide .

"New York (CNN) -- When Alec Baldwin closed out the Academy Awards on Sunday night by slapping director Kathryn Bigelow squarely on the backside, that pretty much said it all. It was Ladies' Night in a Boys' Town. Yes, the opening routine by Baldwin and Steve Martin was very funny; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording, the program moved briskly enough. But did the orchestra need to follow Bigelow's win of her long-deserved best director prize, for ""The Hurt Locker,"" by playing the old Helen Reddy song ""I Am Woman""? When Zoe Saldana and Carey Mulligan arrived on stage to present the Best Original Song award, did they have to be intro-ed with ""Thank Heaven For Little Girls""? And in addition to being groped by Baldwin, did Bigelow have to be so muscled-in-on by her fellow producers when she was picking up the best picture award for her film, ""The Hurt Locker""? 'The Hurt Locker' wins six Oscars . Maybe that wacky Elinor Burkett had a point: The producer of ""Music by Prudence"" -- which had just won the Oscar for best documentary short -- barreled on stage, saying ""Let the woman speak!"" and commandeering the mike from her director, Roger Ross Williams. She provided a classic moment of Oscar craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes. Burkett seemed boorish, sure. But that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year: Vote for the future, or make up for the past. Years from now, it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that ""Avatar,"" one of the biggest movies ever -- and, more importantly, the one that indicates where movies are going -- didn't win the top prize when Hollywood had a chance to bestow it. Instead, the Oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize. What helped make it all so complicated was not that there's been a long, long history of overlooked genius female directors that the Oscars had to atone for. The sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct. Predictably, Bigelow didn't have to be as good as the boys, she had to be better. And she was. But earning your Oscars and actually getting them are two different things. Fortunately for Bigelow, she had history on her side last night. James Cameron didn't. The billions being made by ""Avatar"" will probably be some consolation, but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy, which is what the Academy voters like. In fact, the big-hearted, sentimental acceptance by best actor Jeff Bridges (""Crazy Heart""), and the rather elegant, funny remarks by best actress Sandra Bullock (""The Blind Side""), are exactly what we all want Oscar night to be. That, and a few good jokes, which is what Martin and Baldwin provided, arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring Neil Patrick Harris that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer Alan Carr and the notorious Rob Lowe/Snow White musical overture of 1989. Looking back on Oscar's 'train wreck' Nothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night, although there were a few moments of bad choices, bad manners and a strategy that was, at best, elusive. For all the changing characters and categories on Oscar-watchers' betting pool ballots, there are certain things we bet on no matter what: one, that the show will be interminable; two, that it will last at least until midnight (ET) no matter how they try to contain it; and, three, that there will be moments in the show itself that, although planned by seemingly sane individuals, will be inexplicable, if not grotesque. Last night did not disappoint. While someone like poor Tivi Magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra (after he and Joachim Back won best live action short for ""The New Tenants""), the show's producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable, unspeakable interpretive dance number, this one devoted to the evening's musical scores. More painful, at least to this viewer's eyes, was an overlong salute to the late director John Hughes, featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players, a few of whom -- Molly Ringwald, for instance, and Judd Nelson -- looked positively shell shocked. The only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category: The Argentine ""El Secreto de Sus Ojos,"" beat out the favored ""White Ribbon,"" thus continuing the Oscar tradition of giving the foreign-film prize to something few have even seen (a foreign-film Oscar doesn't do much good, one should remember, for a movie that's already opened and closed). The other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer Sandy Powell accepted her ""Young Victoria"" Oscar. ""I've already got two of these,"" she said, before dissing her coworkers and, by extension, the Academy in toto. Brusque dismissal is not a quality Oscar tolerates very well and it's not likely Ms. Powell will be back, unlike Martin and Baldwin, who were the funniest Oscar hosts ever, proving there's power in numbers, the sum often can be more than the parts, and that it's always good to have an extra pair of hands, as long as they stay off Kathryn Bigelow's butt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Anderson.","Oscar had to atone for history of overlooked female directors, says critic John Anderson .

The islands, which lie 28 miles off Land's End, the UK's most westerly point, are connected to the UK mainland by a single electricity cable which means that power usage in the experiment can be measured efficiently. All of the 2000-strong community who are spread across five islands have been encouraged to join in. The energy savings made will be compared against the previous day's usage with updates appearing online regularly. The E-Day Web site keeps track of costs and kWh usage providing up-to-the-minute information about how much electricity is being used in island-wide as well as individually monitoring Five Islands School on St Mary's Island and the electricity consumption of one family. ""We've fitted the family and the school with special energy monitors so they can accurately monitor what appliances use the most electricity,"" Prescott told CNN. Studies suggest that families who use these sorts of energy monitors can cut their electricity bills by up to 20 percent. At the time of writing, the family's consumption had dropped dramatically, down 35 percent on the previous day, which Prescott estimates is a saving of around £300 ($475) on their annual electricity bill. Sadly the figures for the school and the island as a whole weren't quite so impressive. The school was up six percent on the previous day, while the island as a whole saw a two percent rise in usage. Prescott put these small rises down to the notoriously fickle British weather. ""Yesterday was lovely and sunny,"" he said. ""So far, today it has been rainy."" The damp and gloom have meant more lights being switched on but despite these meteorological setbacks, Prescott remained upbeat about the success of the experiment. ""Before the family left home this morning they turned off everything they could, so their reduction in usage is a fantastic result,"" he said. Visitors to the the E-Day Web site can also play the""5 Things"" game to find out what all sorts of household appliances cost to run and how much they cost you and the environment. ""The E-Day experiment will hopefully prove that the small things can make a big difference, especially when we work together and try to save energy,"" Prescott said. Prescott is also the founder of ""Ban the Bulb"" -- an energy efficiency campaign which is helping phase out the use of incandescent light bulbs in 30 countries. The event has been organized as part of a four-day Earth Summit event which has seen the Isles of Scilly play host to fellow islanders from Samoa, The Galapagos Islands, Madagascar and the Carteret Islands -- whose inhabitants are some of the first people being displaced by rising sea-levels.","UK's Scilly Isles take part in a day-long experiment monitoring electricity consumption .

"(CNN) -- Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger: On January 15, 2009, the airline captain, along with co-pilot Jeff Skiles, guided US Airways Flight 1549 into the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 people on board. In his autobiography, ""Highest Duty,"" the celebrated flier wrote that the landing was not a miracle, but rather the result of decades of practice and training. On Wednesday, Sullenberger, 59, announced his retirement. In the statement he released, he spoke of his passion for the profession, and he mentioned Skiles by name. He wrote, ""Each generation of pilots hopes that they will leave their profession better off than they found it. In spite of the best efforts of thousands of my colleagues, that is not the case today."" Sullenberger wrote that he would remain an advocate for aviation safety and for piloting. ""I will work to remind the entire industry -- and those who manage and regulate it - that we have a sacred duty to our passengers to do the very best that we know how to do."" Flight attendant Doreen Welsh, who served on Flight 1549 with Sullenberger, also announced her retirement from US Airways yesterday. Final flight for 'Sully' 'Miracle on Hudson' pilot retires . Whitney Thompson: California's Arnold Schwarzenegger, like many governors across the nation, faces severe budget problems. Schwarzenegger has called for ""draconian"" spending cuts to deal with a shortfall of nearly $20 billion. The state's public education system has been feeling the pain, and students and teachers are screaming loudly. Last fall, students held a series of protests on the UC Berkeley campus after the announcement last summer of a 32 percent tuition hike throughout the state's university system. Those protests grew into a movement, and Thursday, rallies, marches, demonstrations and teach-ins are scheduled across the state under a ""Day of Action"" banner. There are also protests planned in more than 30 other states to fight further budget cuts, layoffs and furloughs. Whitney Thompson, 23, from Yuma, Arizona, is a ""super-senior"" at Fresno State University. She plans to get her degree in history next fall. She is part of a statewide organization called Students for a Quality Education. Thompson will be speaking Thursday at a rally on the Fresno State campus. ""We're being denied access to quality affordable, education,"" she told CNN on Wednesday. It keeps worsening every year. We're paying more and getting less. They eliminated 1000 classes on my campus alone, including four I was enrolled in, and I had already paid for them. And then on top of that, I had to pay 32 percent more in tuition."" Students across U.S. plan to protest education funding cuts . Protests of tuition increase continue on California campuses . Patricia Overy: The 40-year-old accounting technician and mother of four announced Monday at the City of Lathrop, California, council meeting that she was voluntarily giving up her job. The Manteca Bulletin reported that Overy made the decision in order to save the job of a 60-year-old coworker, Sharon Singleton. The city's budget deficit is $648,000, and Overy told CNN Wednesday that 11 city jobs needed to be eliminated. She had long discussions with her husband, Robert, about her seven years at work and how close she had become with her coworkers. ""There are a lot of mothers with kids,"" she said. ""You know what their favorite crayon colors are. You talk about what you ate for dinner. I thought that I could possibly cope with the loss of a job better than my coworkers."" So her last day was Tuesday, and she's looking forward to spending time with her kids -- ages 14, 7 and 4-year-old twins -- before she looks for work again. ""I feel happy for what I did. I feel that I am so blessed,"" she said. ""I care about people, and that's how I was raised,"" she said. ""Everyday I live my life and think about what positive influence I could have. I'm not perfect, but I try to do my best."" Singleton's last day on her job would have been Thursday. The Manteca Bulletin: Worker's unselfish act . Matthew McCabe: Reps. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, and Dan Burton, R-Indiana, will be joined at a news conference Thursday by accused Navy SEAL Matthew McCabe, as well as more than a dozen retired Navy SEALs, to renew calls for the exoneration of the ""Navy SEAL 3."" In September 2009, McCabe, Petty Officer 1st Class Julio Huertas and Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonathan Keefe were part of the SEAL team that captured and allegedly mistreated al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Hashim Abed, considered one of the most wanted terrorists in Iraq. Abed is the suspected planner behind the 2004 killing, burning and mutilation of four American contractors in Fallujah, Iraq. Abed complained to investigators that the SEALs punched him during his detention. There were arraigned in military court on charges of giving false statements to investigators and abusing Abed. In January, a judge ruled that Keefe and Huertas will have their cases heard in Iraq next month. Petty Officer 2nd Class McCabe, 24, faces a special court martial on May 3 at the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia. The case against the Navy SEALs sparked outrage that the sailors are being tried at all for handling a suspect in the contractors' murders, one of the most notorious incidents in the war. The killings got widespread news coverage when the burned bodies of two of the contractors were paraded through the streets of Fallujah and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered. At today's news conference, Burton and Rohrabacher will present signed petitions of support from more than 100,000 Americans calling for the SEALs' exoneration. If found guilty, the SEALs face a maximum sentence of a year in a military prison, demotion to the lowest Navy rank, a cut in pay and a bad conduct discharge. Yesterday, McCabe's attorney, Neal Puckett, told CNN that his client is pleading not guilty. ""He continues routine training where he works in the Norfolk area. He's completely supported by the chain of command and all of the other SEALs. He's hoping for a good outcome,"" Puckett said. ""He's in good spirits and believes he'll be acquitted."" 2 Navy SEAL cases moved to Iraq . Jose Theodore: The goalie of the Washington Capitals hockey team talked for the first time this week to the Washington Post about the death of his 2-month-old son who died last August from respiratory complications. Chace Theodore was born five weeks early with a neuromuscular condition that has defied diagnosis. To breathe, he was put on a ventilator. Jose and his wife spent most of their son's 54 days at Washington Children's Hospital Center at a time when Jose was trying to win back his starting position with the Capitals. The newspaper reports that he had lost the position when he was replaced by a rookie last spring. Sports psychologist Joel Fish says that being a goalie requires ""the highest level of concentration and focus."" Theodore, an intensely private athlete, said, ""I can remember sometimes, it could be a 2-2 game, and you start thinking about your son, or you start thinking about different stuff."" After his son died, Theodore was named No. 1 goalie again, and he started a ""Saves for Kids"" campaign. He will donate $2 for each save, $100 for each win and $500 for each shutout during the regular season and more during playoffs to a children's medical center.

There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.","'Miracle on Hudson' pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger retires .

"OFF THE BAHAMAS (CNN) -- As the lights come up, Third Day lead singer Mac Powell is a little stumped. He's asked the packed house for requests, but the band can't do the two of the most popular suggestions. Third Day has earned praise from mainstream publications but is still pigeonholed as ""Christian rock."" The first is a song by another popular Christian music group, and the band has never performed it live. The other suggestion is ""Born Again,"" a ballad on their latest album. They have never played it live, either, and have not practiced it as a group in a long time. The album version also includes vocals by Flyleaf's Lacey Mosley, and she's not here. After a people shout out a few more suggestions, Powell looks at the band and changes plans. It's karaoke time. One by one, they bring up fans to sing some of the oldies but goodies. The fans love it, even though the vocals are, well, not concert-worthy. It's moments like this that make Third Day one of the most popular contemporary Christian music bands and the headliner for the 3,000 fans on this Christian-music-themed voyage, the K-Love Friends and Family Cruise. ""It's always fun for the audience and for us,"" drummer David Carr said. ""Every now and then, we are really surprised by what we hear. Both pleasantly -- and not."" The members of Third Day, which has won three Grammy Awards and an American Music Award, are having as much fun on the ship as any of the fans, who are getting a chance to vacation side-by-side with the rockers and 12 other bands. They have brought their families along and -- aside from playing two one-hour gigs -- have been able to be music fans, too. It's a needed break between tours -- the next one begins March 5 -- but the band is intrigued by the fact that at both shows on the cruise, fans have demanded ""Born Again,"" which is scheduled to be the next single from their 10th studio album, ""Revelation."" ""That's going to go into our set list now,"" bassist Tai Anderson said. The band is also enjoying an increase in fame. In June, they became the first Christian band to make the cover of Billboard magazine. "" 'Revelation' should appeal to Third Day's core Christian music audience while expanding its fan base in the mainstream rock arena,"" the magazine said. The crossover success hasn't materialized, but that hasn't disappointed the Atlanta, Georgia-based band. They plan to continue to focus on Christian-music fans even while their new management company looks at other opportunities. ""Getting to lead people in a worship or just even entertaining them is always a reward,"" Carr said. ""I hope that Third Day continues to explore new territories as a band and still keep our core sense of who we are."" They say they were more focused on giving their fans an album with the Southern rock sound that has made the band famous in Christian music while trying to be a little more creative. For ""Revelation,"" Third Day worked with mainstream producer Howard Benson (Daughtry, Hoobastank) in Los Angeles, California, rather than a studio in Atlanta. Anderson says the band pushed itself harder than ever, and even when the record company wanted a finished product, the group pushed back and continued to work and write songs, including the title track. The result, the band believes, is a collection of songs that is lyrically among their best tunes and musically more than what fans were expecting. Carr acknowledges that it sounds clichéd for a band member to tout their latest work as their best. Still, he says, this album is as good as any Third Day has produced. ""Having been a band as long as we have [since 1991] and having put out as many albums as we have, it seemed really apparent that this album had to be great,"" he said. ""If you take time out of the equation and just stacked all of our albums together and set them out there and really compared them, I really feel like this is the best one."" It's also important to give a great concert, the band members say. In this economy, Anderson says, it's extremely important to make fans feel like they aren't seeing or hearing the same old thing. ""No one's gonna feel sorry for musicians, but we have to plan budgets. We're very aware of the production,"" Anderson said. ""We're trying to make sure we give people a good value."" On the K-Love cruise, an annual event that has grown exponentially in popularity, the band gave fans a chance to see their new music DVD, a 75-minute production stuffed with concert footage and backstage scenes. There was a little hitch: It wasn't the final edit. The band thought it had the most recent version but brought along an earlier copy and had to reburn it to get it to play on the ship's video board. Still, the Lido Deck was packed with fans eager to get a closer look at the life of the band. Third Day also added scenes with their families to the DVD. ""Since our fans are so cool and respectful, we'll give them that,"" Anderson said. Anderson says the band is ""antsy"" to produce new music but wants to be careful about what songs they include in their 75-minute concerts. He thinks it's important to listen to the audience suggestions during the request periods and what the karaoke singers want to sing, as well as talking to cruisers about what tunes inspire them. He knows there are still unreleased singles from ""Revelation"" that fans coming to the arena shows are expecting to hear, and it's now obvious that ""Born Again"" is one of them. There are other ballads he expects to click with radio audiences. ""I think we have a lot of life left in this record,"" he said. ""We came out [with singles that were] rocking. It's when there start to be 'heart moments' that Christian records really take off.""","Third Day is first Christian rock band to make cover of Billboard .

"Lisbon, Portugal (CNN)  -- Pope Benedict XVI made one of his strongest statements to date on the sex abuse scandal sweeping the Roman Catholic Church, saying Tuesday the reality he has seen is ""terrifying."" And he distanced himself from criticism of the media by senior Vatican officials, saying the most important attacks on the church don't come from the outside, they come from the sins of the members of the church, CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen said. Benedict was speaking on his plane en route to Portugal, where he is making a four-day visit. He has said very little in public about the scandal, which has swept Western Europe this year, leading bishops to quit or offer to quit in Ireland, Germany and Belgium. Hundreds of people have come forward this year saying they were abused by priests or other Catholic authority figures there and in Austria, Netherlands and the United States. He said three weeks ago he was ""greatly moved"" by meeting victims of abuse in Valletta, Malta. He said he gave the victims ""assurances of the church's action"" after the April 18 meeting. It is not clear if he plans to meet victims of abuse in Portugal, which has not been as badly shaken by the scandal as many other European countries.","Pope Benedict XVI says reality of church child abuse scandal is ""terrifying""

"(CNN)  -- This week is Nurses Week and hospitals across the country, I'm sure, will celebrate it the same way mine does -- by not doing much. Last year we all got goodie bags that held confetti, hard candies and a small candle that was symbolic of helping us light our way. Another year all nurses who had worked five years or more got a beach towel emblazoned with the hospital logo. A beach towel! Who wouldn't be excited about that, especially in land-locked western Pennsylvania? The point isn't the swag, or lack thereof, but the paltriness of the gestures. Hospitals do not function well without nurses, and yet our institutions routinely devalue our work. A 2002 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, led by University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing professor Linda Aiken, revealed that as hospital nurses are assigned more and more patients to care for, the number of patients who die also goes up. Aiken's study assumed a ratio of four patients to every one inpatient nurse, and found that for every additional patient ""in the average nurse's workload,"" the odds of a patient dying increased by 7 percent. New data just released by the same authors in Health Services Research confirms the earlier findings. In a tri-state analysis,  the researchers found that adding a patient to nurses' workloads increased patient mortality by 6 percent in Pennsylvania, 10 percent in New Jersey and 13 percent in California. The thinner nurses are spread in hospitals the greater the number of patients who die. It's that simple. Improved nurse staffing keeps more patients alive because nurses are the canaries in the coal mine, or what Aiken's article in JAMA called ""an around-the-clock surveillance system."" Fewer patients per nurse means that when a patient develops a serious problem, the nurse will be more likely to notice it and have time to address it: page the doctor, make sure needed drugs get ordered, suggest appropriate scans, and above all, continue to monitor the situation -- be ready to call a condition or ""code"" if needed. Hospital patients are sicker than they were 20 years ago because advances in technology and improvements in overall care have meant that more very ill patients survive and end up in hospitals. These unstable patients can spiral down quickly. To ensure patient safety we nurses have to be vigilant, and we need time to do that well. With the advent of managed care, hospitals cut back on their nursing staffs as a way to save money and increase profitability, but that meant they cut back on patient safety, too. So, we nurses don't want towels or party favors for Nurses Week. The best present of all would be hospital floors that always have enough nurses. A serious effort to reduce the amount of required documentation, giving us more time with patients in exchange for less time in front of the computer, would also be a welcome Nurses Week change. Or how about lunch? Research by Dr. Ann Rogers and colleagues in the Journal of Nursing Administration in 2005 showed that nurses routinely work through their allotted lunch breaks in order to provide patient care. Indeed, on my floor, ""lunch"" often means eating in front of the computer while we chart, shoveling down food before running off to give pain medication to a patient who needs it, or putting aside all thoughts of food while helping a patient who's ""having trouble breathing."" Additionally, in many hospitals, nurses are not paid for the 30-minute lunch break we often work through. A quick Google search on ""nurses lunch unpaid"" turns up multiple hits detailing class-action lawsuits filed against hospitals where nurses are not paid for a 30-minute ""lunch,"" even though they spend that time working. Not paying nurses for a half-hour lunch break during which we all typically work is in conflict with the Fair Labor Standards Act, but hospitals must save millions of dollars a year by cheating nurses out of lunch. They save even more money by cutting back on nurse staffing in general. The unpaid and untaken lunch break is a symptom of nurses' work being taken for granted. It represents the chasm separating the life and death value of our work, and the lack of institutional respect we are often accorded. Never forget that the flip side of an overworked nurse, with more patients than she can safely manage, is a dead patient who might have lived otherwise. So, what I would really like for Nurses Week is to have enough nurses to keep as many patients as possible alive. But I'm a realist; I'm willing to start small. Let's give nurses a real break during the day, or pay up for that half hour we work. This week is Nurses Week. It's time for hospitals to stop getting a free lunch. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Theresa Brown.","Theresa Brown: This is Nurses Week, but hospitals don't do much to honor nurses .
Brown: Studies show that as hospitals cut nursing staff, more patients die .
Better staffing, she writes, means more attention can be paid to patients .
Best gift for nurses would be enough staff -- or at least a paid lunch, she says ."
"New York (CNN) -- The suspect in the Times Square bombing attempt was caught as he was seeking to flee to Pakistan, a nation that analyst Fareed Zakaria calls the ""epicenter of Islamic terrorism."" ""It's worth noting that even the terrorism that's often attributed to the war in Afghanistan tends to come out of Pakistan, to be planned by Pakistanis, to be funded from Pakistan or in some other way to be traced to Pakistan,"" said Zakaria. He added that Pakistan's connection with terrorist groups goes back decades and has often been encouraged by that nation's military for strategic reasons. Faisal Shahzad, a 30-year-old naturalized citizen of Pakistani descent, had recently been trained in bomb making in Pakistan's Waziristan province, according to a federal complaint filed in court Tuesday. CNN reported Tuesday that Faisal Shahzad's father is a retired vice-marshal in the Pakistani Air Force. Shahzad was arrested around 11:45 p.m. ET Monday at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport just before he was to fly to Islamabad, Pakistan, by way of Dubai. Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" spoke to CNN on Tuesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: Based on what we know so far, what lessons can be learned from this incident? Fareed Zakaria:  This does not seem to be part of a larger and more organized effort to penetrate the United States. That doesn't mean such efforts are not under way....it does make you realize just how open we are as a country and how open we are as a society.  There is always a level of vulnerability that comes from being an open society and this guy, Mr. Shahzad obviously took advantage of that openness. CNN: Apparently he traveled to Pakistan on a number of occasions. Does that signal that Pakistan isn't vigilant enough about terrorism? Zakaria: Well it certainly signals something that we have known for a while, which is that Pakistan is the epicenter of Islamic terrorism. ... The British government has estimated that something like 80 percent of the terror threats that they receive have a Pakistani connection. So there's no question that Pakistan has a terrorism problem. It has radical groups within the country that have the ability to recruit people and have access to resources that makes for a very combustible mixture. It should remind us that even when looking at the war in Afghanistan, ultimately  the most important place where jihadis are being trained and recruited is not in Afghanistan but in Pakistan. And there's no other part of the world where you have quite the same concentration of manpower, resources and ideology all feeding on each other. CNN: What feeds the ideology that drives the terror effort? Zakaria: Pakistan has been conducive to this kind of jihadis for a number of reasons. For the last three or four decades, the Pakistani government, the Pakistani military has supported, funded many of these groups in a bid to maintain influence in Afghanistan, in a bid to maintain an asymmetrical capacity against India -- in other words, to try to destabilize India rather cheaply through these militant groups rather than frontally through its army. So it has found it useful to have these militant groups and to support them. It has always assumed that these groups will not attack Pakistanis and therefore was not a threat to Pakistan itself. And to a large extent that's true, these groups by and large have attacked people in Afghanistan, India, in the West but not in Pakistan. But that is changing, because these groups are so intermingled and often sufficiently ideological, and also because the Pakistani military is beginning to take them on. But fundamentally the reason this has gone on is that there has been a policy of the Pakistani state and particularly the Pakistani military, to encourage these groups, to fund them, to ignore their most pernicious activities. And some of it goes back even further than four decades. In the 1965 war against India, the Pakistanis used Islamic jihadis... And the great hope now is that finally the Pakistani government is getting serious about this. Frankly it remains a hope. CNN: Why do you say that it's only a hope? Zakaria: Over the last few years, it appears that the Pakistani government has begun to understand that these groups all meld together, that they are a threat to a stable and viable modern Pakistani state. But when I talk about the Pakistani government you have to realize that there are different elements in it. The Pakistani civilian government really does understand the danger that Islamic terrorism poses to Pakistan, but the civilian government in Pakistan appears quite powerless. Most power lies with the military. The military in Pakistan has a somewhat more complex attitude. It does believe that these militants have gone too far. It does believe that it has to take on the militants. And it has actually battled them quite bravely over the last few years. CNN: So what's the reason for thinking the military supports militant groups? Zakaria: It still holds within it the view that at the end of the day, the United States will leave the region and that they will have to live in a neighborhood which will have a very powerful India and an Afghanistan that is potentially a client state of India's -- and that in order to combat this Indian domination, they need to maintain their asymmetrical capabilities, their militant groups. It is interesting to note that Ahmed Rashid, who may be the most respected Pakistani journalist, has reported on the way in which Pakistani government  has thwarted and put obstacles in the way of any kind of talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The message it has sent to the Afghan government is very clear. If you want to have any negotiations with the Taliban, you have to understand that since we are the critical intermediary -- since the Taliban leadership all lives in Pakistan -- the Pakistani military's terms to the Afghan government are, we want you to push back on Indian influence in Afghanistan, we want you to shut down Indian consulates in various Afghan cities. In other words, the Pakistani government is still obsessed with the idea of an Indian domination of the region, and they're using their influence with the Taliban to try to counter Indian influence. This is the old game that the Pakistanis have played. That's what makes me skeptical that there's been a true strategic revolution in Pakistan... There are still people who believe that there are good terrorists and bad terrorists, and some you can work with to further Pakistan's goals. CNN: In the attempted car bombing in Times Square and the Christmas Day attempted bombing, you have two failed plots that don't appear to be highly sophisticated. Does that tell us anything about the terror groups? Zakaria: At some level, that tells you about the weakness of the terror groups. You do not have highly organized terrorist groups with great resources and capacity that are able to plan spectacular acts of terrorism the way they were in the 1990s and on 9/11. What you have now are more isolated, disorganized lone rangers and while they're obviously very worrying and one has to be extremely vigilant, it is also at some level a sign of the weakness of an organization like al Qaeda that it is not able to do the kind of terrorist attacks it used to. To be sure, it's important to be very vigilant and make sure you have groups like al Qaeda on the run. But I don't know that in a free society, you will ever be able to prevent an individual with no background in terrorism who's broken no laws and is radicalized from attempting to make some kind of trouble.","Naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent charged in Times Square bomb probe .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Copenhagen, Denmark, is 5,000 miles away from New Orleans, Louisiana. But representatives of the 192 nations gathering this week at the climate change conference need to keep the memory of a flooded New Orleans in mind. Two years ago this month, the Make It Right Foundation was launched to help the families of New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward rebuild their lives and community. That was already two years after Katrina, and the once-vibrant neighborhood was still in ruins, failed by government and frustrated by a lack of progress. Working with the Lower 9th Ward community, with families who lost everything in Katrina, with cutting-edge architects and inventive builders, we learned some truths and made some discoveries we would like to share with the climate change negotiators in Copenhagen: . We need urgent action. Climate change is real and happening now. The world already is reeling from the consequences -- rising sea levels, more violent storms, more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts. Hurricane Katrina, the killer heat wave in Europe, China's floods and the enduring drought in Australia are not anomalies, they are harbingers. It is not enough to attack what causes global warming; we also must prepare to live with it. We must reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the changing climate. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped increasing today, the climate would continue to change for generations because of the gases that are already in the atmosphere. People will go home, even if home is in harm's way. The pull of family, friends and happy memories proved irresistible for many in the Lower 9th Ward. The common history and culture of any community will keep people living in flood plains, along earthquake faults, and on shorelines, if those places are home. More people are moving into harm's way. The number of people who live at the water's edge will continue to grow. The Lower 9th Ward is not unique -- more than 50 percent of America's population lives within 50 miles of a coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The same percentage applies to the world's population. In the United States, NOAA  predicts the number will rise as high as 75 percent by 2050 or sooner. Governments were formed to protect their citizens -- and not just from armed marauders. Solutions exist to protect people and allow them to live safely in their homes. The consequences of climate change require every community to make changes that will increase safety and survivability. In post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, we are building affordable homes designed to use less energy, reduce carbon emissions and run on solar power, as well as weather the next storm. Our storm-resistant features include high foundations to keep homes well above base flood levels; hurricane-resistant fabric to protect windows; increased structural durability to withstand 130-mph or higher winds; and access to the rooftop -- because so many of Katrina's victims died trapped in their attics. This approach should be adopted by coastal-area builders around the globe. Government has a unique and powerful role to play. Individual actions add up, but they pale compared to the reach and resources of government. We saw firsthand after Katrina how deadly and devastating it can be for a government to fail its citizens. Today, we still see boarded-up houses, razed landscapes and blighted neighborhoods across New Orleans -- over four years after the Army Corps of Engineers-built levees failed. There are large-scale solutions that only governments can provide -- such as setting emissions standards and initiating adaptation measures. These options are available to the participants in Copenhagen. It is time for the world's governments to step up. We are facing the most serious challenge to the health and well-being of the world since World War II. But instead of putting shoulders to the wheel, the leaders of the world are busy lowering expectations and tempering outcomes. Instead, we ask them to act with urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and embrace solutions that will help our children survive and thrive in a changing climate. They have the power to put the planet on a smarter, safer path to a low-carbon future and to protect us and generations to come. We ask them to use it. To quote Richard B. Alley, a climate-change expert from Penn State University, ""This is real, this is real, this is real. So act now, the ball's in your court.""

"(Mother Nature Network) -- Mother's Day poems come in all shapes and sizes. Many address the poet's memories of his mother. Others describe the poet's gratitude for his mother. Some are very short. Some are very long. Sometimes the mother-child relationship is complicated and the poet discusses the good times along with the bad. Other times, it's a straightforward message of love and gratitude. If nothing else, the poet almost always acknowledges the significant role a mother plays in the lives of her children. Needless-to-say, with Mom being portrayed so many different ways in poetry, there are several avenues for approaching a selection of poems appropriate for Mother's Day. Well, we're here to help you. Here's a list of selected works to get you started with Mother's Day poems: . Mother Nature Network: Mother's Day song guide . ""To My Mother"" by Robert Louis Stevenson . The Scottish poet evokes childhood memories in this four-line ode to Mom. It appeared ""A Child's Garden of Verses,"" a collection of 65 poems by Stevenson first published in 1885 under the title ""Penny Whistles."" You too, my mother, read my rhymes For love of unforgotten times, And you may chance to hear once more The little feet along the floor. ""Kaddish"" by Allen Ginsberg . Ginsberg, one of the leading voices of the Beat Generation, wrote this lengthy poem following the 1956 death of his mother. It was published as part of a collection, ""Kaddish and Other Poems: 1958-1960."" Its title refers to the traditional Jewish prayer recited during times of mourning. ""To My Mother"" by Christina Rosetti . Rosetti, a 19th century English poet best known for her lengthy poem called ""Goblin's Market,"" wrote this short piece about her mother in 1842: .

""Mother o' Mine"" by Rudyard Kipling . The Nobel laureate, who lived from 1865 to 1936, wrote about the undying love of a mother in this 11-line poem: . If I were hanged on the highest hill, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! I know whose love would follow me still, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! If I were drowned in the deepest sea, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! I know whose tears would come down to me, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! If I were damned of body and soul, I know whose prayers would make me whole, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! ""Mother to Son"" by Langston Hughes .

"(CNN) -- Margaret Sanger opened the first American family-planning clinic in 1916, and nothing would be the same again. Since then the growing proliferation of birth control methods has had an awesome effect on both sexes and led to a sea change in moral values. And as I've grown older over the past five decades -- from 1960 to 2010 -- and lived through this revolutionary period in female sexuality, I've seen how it has altered American society -- for better or worse. On the upside, by the early 60's The Pill had made it easier for a woman to choose to delay having children until after she established herself in a career. Nonetheless, for young women of childbearing age (I was one of them) there was a need for some careful soul searching -- and consideration about the long-range effects of oral contraceptives -- before addressing this very personal decision. It was a decision I too would have to face when I discovered I was pregnant at age 19. Even though I was married to the baby's father, Jim Welch, I wasn't prepared for this development. It meant I would have to put my career ambitions on hold. But ""the choice"" was not mine alone to make. I had always wanted to have Jim's babies, but wasn't at all sure how he would react. At the time, we were 19-year-old newlyweds, struggling to make ends meet. But he was unflinching in his desire to keep our baby and his positive, upbeat attitude about the whole prospect turned everything around. I have always loved Jim for how he responded in that moment. During my pregnancy, I came to realize that this process was not about me. I was just a spectator to the metamorphosis that was happening inside my womb so that another life could be born. It came down to an act of self-sacrifice, especially for me, as a woman. But both of us were fully involved, not just for that moment, but for the rest of our lives. And it's scary. You may think you can skirt around the issue and dodge the decision, but I've never known anyone who could. Jim and I had two beautiful children who've been an ongoing blessing to both of us. Later, I would strike out on my own, with my little ones, as a single mother to pursue a career in the movies. It was far from ideal, but my children didn't impede my progress. They grounded me in reality and forced me into an early maturity. I should add that having two babies didn't destroy my figure. But if I'd had a different attitude about sex, conception and responsibility, things would have been very different. One significant, and enduring, effect of The Pill on female sexual attitudes during the 60's, was: ""Now we can have sex anytime we want, without the consequences. Hallelujah, let's party!"" It remains this way. These days, nobody seems able to ""keep it in their pants"" or honor a commitment! Raising the question: Is marriage still a viable option? I'm ashamed to admit that I myself have been married four times, and yet I still feel that it is the cornerstone of civilization, an essential institution that stabilizes society, provides a sanctuary for children and saves us from anarchy. In stark contrast, a lack of sexual inhibitions, or as some call it, ""sexual freedom,"" has taken the caution and discernment out of choosing a sexual partner, which used to be the equivalent of choosing a life partner. Without a commitment, the trust and loyalty between couples of childbearing age is missing, and obviously leads to incidents of infidelity. No one seems immune. As a result of the example set by their elders, by the 1990s teenage sexual promiscuity -- or hooking up -- with multiple partners had become a common occurrence. Many of my friends who were parents of teenagers sat in stunned silence several years ago when it came to light that oral sex had become a popular practice among adolescent girls in middle schools across the country. The 13-year-old daughter of one such friend freely admitted to performing fellatio on several boys at school on a regular basis. ""Aw come on, Mom. It's no big deal. Everyone is doing it,"" she said. Apparently, since it's not the act of intercourse, kids don't count it as sex. Can any sane person fail to make a judgment call about that? Seriously, folks, if an aging sex symbol like me starts waving the red flag of caution over how low moral standards have plummeted, you know it's gotta be pretty bad. In fact, it's precisely because of the sexy image I've had that it's important for me to speak up and say: Come on girls! Time to pull up our socks! We're capable of so much better.

"(CNN)  -- Diego Forlan scored a dramatic extra time winner as Atletico Madrid beat Fulham 2-1 in Hamburg to win the Europa League final on Wednesday night. It was the second of the match for Forlan, who had put Atletico ahead after 32 minutes with Simon Davies equalizing for the English Premier League side six minutes later. Atletico created the better chances in normal and added time with Sergio Aguero a constant threat and it was the Argentine star who set up the winner for his strike partner with four minutes remaining in the second period of extra time. He found space on the left of the Fulham defense and his low cross was diverted past Mark Schwarzer by Forlan's clever touch which took a slight deflection off Brede Hangeland. Fulham, who had upset the odds more than once to reach the final, could not force a second equalizer and it was Atletico, so often in the shadow of their city neighbors Real, who were left to celebrate their second major European club trophy after a gap of 48 years. Fulham manager Roy Hodgson took a chance on the fitness of star striker Bobby Zamora, who is struggling with an Achilles injury that has ended his England World Cup hopes. But it was Atletico who had the best of the early skirmishes and Forlan saw an effort thud against a post. But he was on target just after the half hour mark as an Agueuro scuffed effort fell into his path and he beat Schwarzer to open the scoring. Zamora was clearly less than fully fit, but his burst caused chaos in the Spanish defense and when Zoltan Gera crossed from the right a slight deflection saw the ball fall perfectly into the path of Davies, who volleyed home. Uruguay star Forlan pulled a fine save out of Australian international Schwarzer before halftime but the other side of the break saw Davies nearly add to his tally. Zamora went off to give way to Clint Dempsey and both sides had promising attacking moments as players tired. In extra time, Atletico again looked the more threatening and when Raul Garcia cut the ball into the path of Aguero he looked certain to score but put his effort into the side netting. Penalties loomed until Aguero did superbly to keep control of the ball down the left and his cross found Forlan the more alert to end Fulham's dream.","Diego Forlan scores both goals as Atletico Madrid beat Fulham 2-1 in Europa League final .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional hearings into the massive oil spill growing in the Gulf of Mexico will start Tuesday, as winds continue to push the crude closer to the Mississippi Delta. BP America President Lamar McKay and Transocean President Steven Newman will appear before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the morning and then the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the afternoon. BP leased from Transocean the oil rig that exploded off the Louisiana coast last month, starting the spill. Senators are expected to quiz McKay and Newman about the precautions taken before the blast that set off the underwater gusher and the steps being taken to stop the spill. Experts also are expected to testify on the possible impact of the spill on fishing, tourism and local economies. Also on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano plans to travel to Mobile, Alabama, ""to inspect ongoing operations to minimize the Deepwater BP Oil Spill's impact on public health, the environment and the economy,"" the Deepwater Horizon Joint Information Center said in a statement. Napolitano and Alabama Gov. Bob Riley plan to talk with reporters late Tuesday afternoon, the center said. A change in the weather could push more oil from BP's Deepwater Horizon site into the Mississippi Delta region and areas west of the river, according to Gov. Bobby Jindal, who called the development ""bad news for Louisiana."" Louisiana has been mostly spared since the oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana. The catastrophe is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico each day. Most of the slick has been centered in an area east of the environmentally sensitive delta. ""We've said all along that the oil coming west of the river would pose a whole new set of challenges,"" Jindal said at a Monday news conference. He detailed efforts to place booms and other restraining devices into four passes near Grand Isle to prevent the oil from reaching land. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters had warned over the weekend that the Mississippi Delta and areas to the northeast of it -- including Breton Sound, the Chandeleur Islands and the mainland behind them -- could see oil hit the coast by Tuesday. So far, the spill has had little impact on wildlife, said Mark J. Musaus, deputy director of the Southeast region for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at Fort Jackson, Louisiana, he said. Two of them, a gannet and a pelican, were released Monday back into the wild. Another oiled pelican was still in the treatment center, as was a green heron, he said. The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living from fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The government has closed parts of the Gulf to fishing. The affected area, which is east of the Mississippi Delta, comprises about 4.5 percent of the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA said. Hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the Gulf coastline. Thousands of workers and volunteers also have been skimming the water's surface.","Presidents of BP, Transocean to appear before two Senate committees Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Italian manager Gianfranco Zola has been sacked by English Premier League club West Ham, while former England boss Steve McLaren has joined German side Wolfsburg. The Hammers announced in a statement on their official Web site that they had terminated Zola's contract after a season in which they finished just one place above the relegation zone. West Ham's new owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, who took control of the club in January, made clear there would be changes at the end of the season, and they have been true to their word. The official statement read: ""West Ham United confirm that they have terminated the contract of Gianfranco Zola. ""The Board of Directors would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him well for the future. The Club will now be focusing its efforts on seeking a replacement."" Meanwhile, ex-England coach Steve McLaren has been confirmed as Wolfsburg's new coach. McLaren led Dutch side FC Twente to their first ever league title last season and will become the first English coach to take charge of a German side. A statement on Wolfsburg's official Web site said: ""Steve McClaren is to take over as new trainer at VfL Wolfsburg. The 49 year old will start work on July 1st under a two year contract to keep him in Wolfsburg until June 30th 2012."" Former Netherlands and Ajax coach Marco van Basten has ruled himself out of the running to become the next boss of Italian giants AC Milan. Media reports in Italy claim current coach Leonardo will leave the club in the summer but according to the UK Press Association, Van Basten told Italian television that a serious ankle injury would rule him out of contention. He said: ""I am still not ready. I still have an ankle problem and I must resolve it. I can't do a big job like that of a coach as for that your mind has to be clear. ""I have read the reports about Milan and me. It's a good idea. Milan and the people of Milan are kind to me, but right now I have this problem with my ankle and it doesn't seem right to see a coach limp on the pitch.""","Gianfranco Zola has been sacked by West Ham United .
