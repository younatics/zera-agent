"A 93-year-old World War II veteran who left high school to enlist in the Army has finally received his diploma. Domenic Giarrusso was honored Thursday with a ceremony and received the qualification he would have received when he quit to join the war effort in 1940. During hid service he worked as an airplane mechanic and earned his GED when he returned to Rhode Island. But he didn't have a graduation ceremony. Scroll down for video . Domenic Giarrusso was honored Thursday with a ceremony and received the qualification he would have received when he quit to join the war effort in 1940 . As his daughter and grandson looked on in the library at Cranston High School West, Giarrusso was handed the framed document by Providence School Supt. Susan Lusi. She told him his degree was earned not only in the classroom but in the experience of his life. After the brief ceremony, Giarrusso said he's come 'full circle in life. Life is complete.' 'I enlisted into the service because I felt that there was a job that needed to be done."",' he told ABC 6. His work with airplanes has left him hard of hearing but as he flashed his still mint condition bomber jacket for reports it was clear his hear and spirit were still strong. Before receiving the diploma he gave the school a special talk about his wartime experience. During hid service he worked as an airplane mechanic and earned his GED when he returned to Rhode Island. But he didn't have a graduation ceremony . Though his daughter and grandson were there, his wife was sadly not. 'My wife passed away two and a half years ago which I miss greatly. Wish she were here,' he said. Grandson Steve Giarrusso called it a proud moment. 'I hear all the stories of him being in the service, not so much from when he was in school; now I know why. And so very proud of him to have it come full circle for him,' he said. The elder Giarrusso left students with some words of wisdom. 'It's not about me; it's we. We gotta depend on each other to accomplish things,' he said.","Domenic Giarrusso was honored Thursday with a ceremony and received the diploma he would have received when he quit high school in 1940 .

"Hundreds of desperate Venezuelans are being forced to beg for medicine on Twitter because the crumbling economy has left the country unable to import basic medical supplies. Using the hashtag '#ServicioPublico', Venezuelans are pleading with foreigners to send them treatments for all manner of conditions - including blood disorders, viruses and infections. Things have got so bad in the country that experts are claiming that 15 per cent of those who die of cancer would have had a chance of survival had proper radiotherapy treatment been provided. Supply: This  photograph shows the inside of a refrigerator storage area at a blood bank in Caracas. A year ago, the blood bank was open for 12 hours every day. Now, it only takes donations on weekday mornings . Decline: A patient is seen resting at the Central Hospital in Maracay, Venezuela. Legions of ailing Venezuelans are being neglected by a national health care system that doctors say is now collapsing . One tweet using the #ServicioPublico hashtag was sent on behalf on 22-year-old Vanessa Chacón, who desperately needed 10mg of Infalgan solution for use in injections to treat her severe coronary condition, according to Ozy. The tweet itself was sent by her uncle Nelson Jaimes who, despite being a pharmacist with good contacts, has had no luck obtaining his niece's medicine himself. 'My niece is very sick. We haven't been able to locate the drug in pharmacies or in hospitals,' he said. 'We who are inside the pharma business can't locate the products. What can a regular citizen expect to find?,' he added. The lack of medicine in Venezuela has got so bad that businesses who used to regularly deal with pharmaceutical companies have now severed their relationships as there simply isn't enough medicine available to make the industry profitable. Pharmacy shelves lie empty, with even basics like vitamin C, folic acid, headache pills and remedies for mosquito bites almost entirely unavailable in the capital Caracas. Not enough: Using the hashtag '#ServicioPublico', Venezuelans are pleading with foreigners to send them treatments for all manner of conditions - including blood disorders, viruses and infections . Ill: Evelina Gonzalez  is on a list of 31 breast cancer patients waiting to have tumors removed at one of the country's biggest medical facilities, Maracay's Central Hospital. The hospital's physicians sent some 300 patients in need of cancer operations home last month . Every day several hundred people take to Twitter to beg total strangers for help in obtaining the medicine their loved ones so desperately need. The vast majority of these posts go unanswered, and those replies that are received are usually just messages of support or sympathy, not help. Shockingly the crisis is only getting worse as Venezuela's economy  crumbles and a lack of foreign currency in the country means internal distributors have no way of paying international suppliers. Medical shipments have dried up as Venezuelan pharmaceutical companies seek to pay off their combined debts of well in excess of $245 million, rather than bring in additional expensive products. A black market in goods is understood to have been established, with drugs being smuggled in from neighbouring Colombia, but the supply ins't nearly enough to provide medicine for all who need it. The only response from the Venezuelan government to the developing crisis so far had been to issue an directive stating: 'It is strictly prohibited for patients or their families to bring medicines or medical supplies for their treatment, even if hospitals don't have the necessary supplies.' The government is said to have clamped down on hospitals discussing the shortage of medical supplies and there were reportedly arrests made when protesters took photographs of a long queue outside a pharmacy in the capital.

Shockingly the crisis is only getting worse as Venezuela's economy crumbles and a lack of foreign currency in the country means internal distributors have no way of paying international suppliers . This morning Venezuela's bolivar currency plunged during the debut of a new exchange rate system aimed at easing the country's crippling economic crisis. The central bank said the bolivar averaged 170 to the U.S. dollar in the first day of trading on the new market where businesses and individuals can circumvent decade-old currency controls and now legally buy greenbacks. That compares with 6.3 and 12 bolivars per dollar for priority imports and 190 bolivars on the black market. President Nicolas Maduro is counting on the new currency system to better allocate dollars that have become scarcer as a result of a plunge in oil prices. But economists say that with fewer dollars overall entering Venezuela shortages will remain widespread and inflation already running at over 60 percent could worsen.","Venezuelans are pleading with foreigners to send them medicine using the hashtag '#ServicioPublico'

"Australia had more fatal shark attacks in 2014 than any other country, according to a global study released by the University of Florida. However, the two deaths and the 11 overall unprovoked attacks by sharks in Australian waters last year were in line with the average over the past decade. George Burgess, curator of world shark attack data at the University of Florida's Museum of Natural History, says the steady numbers in Australia are 'often lost in the resultant media feeding frenzy' when an attack occurs. He says beachgoers are more likely to win the lottery than encounter a shark. Australia accounted two-thirds of fatal shark attacks in the world last year, according to a new global report . 'It's amazing, given the billions of hours humans spend in the water, how uncommon attacks are,' Burgess said. The report describes the Western Australian government's cull of endangered white sharks as 'ill-conceived'. South Africa had a 'low contact' year, with one fatal incident and two overall attacks, well below the recent 10-year average of 4.3 attacks per year. There were single incidents reported in New Zealand, Reunion, Japan, Spain, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and the Galapagos Islands. Three people died worldwide from shark attacks in 2014, far below the average of 6.3 deaths per year over the past decade. Australia's 11 attacks were lower than its 12.5 attacks per year average over the past 10 years . There were four shark attacks in South Australia, three in NSW, two in Western Australia, and single incidents in Queensland and Victoria . Burgess attributes the downward trend in fatalities to advances in beach safety, medical care and awareness of how to avoid attacks. There were 72 attacks worldwide, down from 75 in 2013. Australia's 11 attacks were lower than its 12.5 attacks per year average over the past 10 years (2004-13) and the two fatalities were in line with its 1.5 yearly average over the same time period. The Australian Shark Attack File, released with Florida's international study, was compiled by curator John West for the Taronga Conservation Society Australia. There were four shark attacks in South Australia, three in NSW, two in Western Australia, and single incidents in Queensland and Victoria. In the 1990s, the average number of 6.5 unprovoked cases per year in Australia has risen to an average of 13 per year over the past decade. The 11 cases reported in 2014 were below the 10-year average. Australia had more fatal shark attacks in 2014 than any other country, according to a new global study . Beach closed sign at Shelly Beach in Ballina, NSW after a 41-year-old man dies following a shark attack . In Australia in 2014, there were seven unprovoked attacks on surfboard and bodyboard riders, three on swimmers (one fatal), and one fatal attack on a snorkeller. White sharks were involved in eight of the 11 cases of unprovoked attacks in Australia with six on surfboard riders, one fatal attack on a swimmer, and one fatal attack on a snorkeller. A bull shark attacked a swimmer, inflicting severe injuries, and a wobbegong caused minor injuries to a swimmer in shallow water. A suspected bronze whaler bit a surfboard rider on the leg, leaving only minor teeth marks. The attacks in Australia were spread across the year, with six in cooler winter months and five in warmer summer months. Attacks in Australia were spread across the year, with six in cooler winter months and five in  summer months . A shark warning sign is seen posted on the beach in the northern NSWcity of Newcastle on January 17, 2015 . Unprovoked attacks are defined as incidents where an attack on a live human by a shark occurs in its natural habitat without human provocation of the shark. Burgess said the overall trend decade on decade has been a steady increase in attacks worldwide, but not because sharks are getting a taste for humans. As the human population and the popularity of aquatic pastimes grow, humans are more likely to be where sharks are feeding. 'I am willing to predict that there will be more attacks in the second decade of this century than there were in the first,' Burgess said. Worldwide in 2014, surfers and others participating in board sports accounted for 65 per cent of cases, with swimmers/waders at 32 per cent, and snorkellers, three per cent. There were no attacks on scuba divers in 2014.","Australia accounted two-thirds of fatal shark attacks in the world last year .

"Tony Abbott's wife Margie has revealed the unexpected chivalrous side of the Australian Prime Minister, speaking candidly about her husband's small acts of love- which include taking his shoes off. Mrs Abbott said that when she complained to her husband that her heels were hurting her feet at the end of the couple's annual Christmas party, he suggested that she take her shoes off. 'If it makes you feel any better I’ll take mine off,' he said. Tony Abbott's wife Margie said that the Prime Minister has a secret chivalrous side . Despite chastising him for slipping off his RM Williams because it wasn't dignified, Mrs Abbott maintains that the gesture reflected the Prime Minister hidden gentlemanly nature. 'Absolutely. It was like trailing your coat over a puddle,' she told The Daily Telegraph. She also added that her husband had 'a lot of grace', a quality which she said he needed during last Monday’s leadership spill vote. The couple's daughter Frances reflected on the backlash Mr Abbott had faced from the media and rebel backbenchers, defending him as 'still doing a great job, which is that of our father.' Speaking at the Myer Autumn/Winter show in Melbourne on Thursday, the fashion graduate said it was hard to see his name pulled through the mud on a regular basis. 'It always effects you when people you love are slammed in the media, it's not fun, but it's the nature of the beast... It's happened before and will happen again,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Mrs Abbott said that when she complained to her husband that her heels were hurting her feet at the end of the couple's annual Christmas party, he suggested that she take her shoes off . Margie Abbott said that that her husband had 'a lot of grace' Mr Abbott's daughter defended him as 'still doing a great job, which is that of our father.' 'For him, it's how he gets back up from that that will be a measure of his character. We will always support him.' Earlier this month the garrulous brunette spoke candidly about her relationship with her father, admitting that just like any daughter she constantly worries about him,  despite living in another city they are always in touch. She moved from Sydney to Melbourne to focus on her career and, of course,  her father is based in Canberra. ‘My standard text message is: “You’re doing an amazing job.”’ And he’ll reply: “Thanks angel,”’ she explained to Daily Mail Australia. She also added: ‘I’m always thinking about him, especially with everything that’s happened recently with terrorism.' ‘My standard text message is: “You’re doing an amazing job.”’ And he’ll reply: “Thanks angel,”’ she explained to Daily Mail Australia.

The middle of Mr Abbott's three daughters, Frances, who works as an assistant buyer for the children's department in Myer, wen on to reveal the moment she got her 'A' tattoo, which she said he father wasn't originally supportive of. In 2013 she spoke to Who Magazine about the tattoo, explaining her father wasn't too happy about it at first. 'I gave [mum and dad] a warning. I said, ""I am getting one,"" and Dad said, ""You are mutilating your body."" Then I went and got it done and they thought it was pretty.' 'I know my family name won't be carried on as my father didn't have any sons, so I thought I'm going to get it permanent on my back.' The brunette was not accompanied by her boyfriend Lindsay Smith, who also works for Myer, revealing he was having supper with his family. It seems there are more hidden adornments on the Prime Minister's daughter's body. She has also cheekily admitted to having more than just one inking on her body telling Daily Mail Australia: 'I might [have more tattoos] but you won't be seeing them.'

Fashionista: Frances, sitting in the front row of the Autumn/winter show in a pink crop top, spoke candidly about her father at the annual parade . Last year Frances was embroiled in scandal when it was revealed that she received a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister. She accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors. The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said. Mr Abbott had not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events.

"His father might be a Manchester United and Real Madrid legend but Brooklyn Beckham is well on his way to a stellar career at Arsenal. The 15-year-old, already a Gunners fan, signed for the club's youth team late last year and has been showing off his sporting prowess on social media. Much like his father, who was famous for his ability to strike a ball with his right foot, Brooklyn has been blessed with similar talent. Scroll down for video . Brooklyn Beckham shared an Instagram video of himself in action for Arsenal's youth team this week . In a video posted on his Instagram account, the fledgling footballer is seen in his No.15 shirt booting a half-volley, which the opposition goalkeeper just about saved. The teen, who previously had trials with Chelsea, Fulham, Manchester United and Queens Park Rangers, was first reported to have signed a short-term deal with Arsenal in November. Victoria and David Beckham's eldest son was said to have impressed several clubs, but decided to go with the Gunners. Brooklyn’s brother Romeo, 12, has also been playing for the club’s under-13s, while youngest son Cruz, nine, has been representing the club’s under-10s. Beckham Jnr received the ball from the right inside the area before controlling the ball to set up a shot . Brooklyn sends a powerful right-foot volley towards the goal in a bid to score for Arsenal's young side . The 15-year-old was close to scroing a goal but the opposition goalkeeper did well to tip the ball onto the bar . Despite inheriting his father's accurate right foot, Brooklyn is apparently embarrassed to be seen at training with his dad. Speaking in a recent interview, David revealed that the 15-year-old asks to be dropped off around the corner, so no one sees them together. Asked how he would be celebrating his upcoming 16th birthday, Beckham told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that his son was likely to celebrate with his friends separately revealing that he has been asked to stay well away from the school gates. He said: 'He’s at the age now where he does not want me to drop him off outside school. He does not want too much affection but, yes, I still kiss him. Brooklyn Beckham poses with his Arsenal team-mates in a snap the youngster shared via Instagram . Brooklyn takes to the Old Trafford pitch as a youngster following Man United's Premier League title triumph . 'He [said to me] ""Can you drop me round the corner?"",' continued the proud father. 'As he was walking into school, I wound down the window and shouted ""I love you"" to him. 'He was not happy but it made him smile a few days later.' Talking about to his son's 16th birthday celebrations on the 4th March, Beckham revealed it will be a low key - and family free - affair. 'I think he wants to go for a dinner with his friends,' said Beckham. 'He’ll have a separate dinner with his family because he’s at the age now when he doesn’t want me to drop him outside the school and things like that - which I definitely do anyway!'

"At least 24 pilot whales have died on a New Zealand beach after 198 of the sea creatures became stranded on Friday. Authorities have expressed concern for the remaining whales on Farewell Spit at Golden Bay in the country's south island, as weather conditions proved too warm for the animals,The New Zealand Herald reports. An attempt to re-float the whales during high tide at about 5pm failed, with many whales becoming re-stranded. At least 24 of the 198 whales stranded on a New Zealand beach are reported to have died on Monday . Up to 500 volunteers are predicted to be needed to keep the animals cool and wet on Saturday . The Department of Conservation's (DoC) Golden Bay Conservation Services Manager Andrew Lamason asked the public to leave the rescue to trained volunteers, most of whom are from the community group Project Jonah, due to the risks involved in refloating operations. However, he estimated up to 500 volunteers would be needed to keep the whales cool and wet until the next high tide on Saturday. 'We'll just keep on trying,' Mr Lamason told the New Zealand Herald. 'Re-floating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job, so it's important we have the right people on the ground tonight trying to get these whales back to safety,' he said on Friday. However, he added that there was a possibility the whales would need to be euthanized if they remained stranded. Stranded whales can become dehydrated quickly, suffer sunburns and can die from their own weight crushing their organs. The stranded pod, which includes many young whales as well as adults, are beached up to 6km up the shoreline. 'It's like a hapu or a village. It's a whole mixed family group,' Mr Lamason said. Attempts to refloat the whales during a high tide failed, with volunteers planning try again at the next high tide . Both young and adult whales are part of the pod that are stranded up to 6km up the beach . The reason that whales become stranded is not completely understood, however it is considered a natural phenomenon. 'Possibly the leader is sick or disoriented and the herd simply follows the leader or a young whale may strand by accident and the rest of the herd try to come to the rescue,' the DoC's website states. 'They may run into problems when the shoreline is gently sloping; sand and mud absorb the sonar signals they use for navigation, giving a false indication of deeper water.' Mr Lamason said the shallow hook-like nature of the beach was likely to have influenced the event. 'People should bring buckets, spades and old sheets. A bus will be put on from Triangle Flat at the base of Farewell Spit. People need to be prepared with sunscreen, hats, water, food and warm clothing if they want to assist,' he said of Saturday's operation. The reason whales become stranded are not completely understood by scientists .","A total of 198 pilot whales are stranded on New Zealand's south island .

"A homeless man has been arrested for allegedly breaking into a Georgia funeral home and having sex with a woman's body. Domonique Smith, 26, was arrested on Monday when he was found with a bike stolen from the Hill Watson Peoples Funeral Service in Columbus during a burglary. Further investigation revealed that a body of a dead woman had been disturbed when the burglary occurred on December 29, police said. Domonique Smith, 26, was arrested on Monday when he was found with a bike stolen from a funeral home in Columbus during a burglary. He was later charged with necrophilia . 'The results of our investigation and the forensic examination gave us probable cause to believe that this individual had indeed sexually assaulted a dead body,' said Columbus Police Major Gil Slouchick. Smith matched the description of a suspect in the crime, police said. Captain Gordon Griswould said that Smith was found in a vacant home with other stolen property, including TVs and guns, according to the Ledger-Inquirer. Investigations revealed that a body of a female victim had been sexually assaulted during the December burglary of the Hill Watson Peoples Funeral Service (pictured).  Smith matched the description of a suspect in the crime, police said. He would not comment on the alleged sexual act nor would he identify the victim, but he said the family has been informed of the charges and ongoing police investigation. Griswould added that necrophilia charges were 'extremely rare' in Columbus. Smith pleaded guilty to burglary, entering an unoccupied dwelling, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and theft by receiving stolen property, according to the newspaper. He is currently in jail. It's unclear if Smith has an attorney. He is expected to appear in court on the necrophilia charge Monday. If convicted, he could serve up to ten years for necrophilia.","Domonique Smith, 26, was arrested on Monday in Columbus, Georgia .

"A jealous ex who tried to kill his former girlfriend's new partner as he slept in a savage machete attack  has been jailed for 22 years. Gary Johnson had burst into Holly Dobson's house and began punching then hacking at  Christopher Spinks, 27, as he lay in bed, a court heard. Slashing at his face and body, the vicious attack left the victim with serious injuries including one blow which went down to the bone, and another which split his ear in two. Jealous Gary Johnson (left) had burst into his ex-girlfriend Holly Dobson's house and started to punch and hack at her new partner Christopher Spinks (pictured right, after the attack) with a machete . Newcastle Crown Court heard how the 26-year-old broke into Holly Dobson's home in  Stanley, County Durham, at around 4.45am on August 9 last year. Ms Dobson, 31, said she tried to stop the attack on her new boyfriend of three weeks by grabbing Johnson's shoulders but she was unable to move him. Sarah Mallet, prosecuting, told the court during the trial: 'Christopher Spinks was still asleep naked in bed when he was attacked. 'Holly Dobson was panicking, she was unsure whether to stop the attack or find her phone and ring the police. Her partner's ear was split open, his leg was split open and she could see the bone.' Johnson replied to her pleas to stop attacking the victim by saying: 'I'll kill him, I am going to kill him.' Mr Spinks sustained major injuries with his ear cut in two after Johnson broke attacked him with a machete while he was asleep . When Ms Dobson dialled 999, Johnson allegedly ran from the house taking the machete with him before being arrested by police. She later told police: 'It was absolutely horrendous, he was like a caged animal. 'I tried to pull him off when he was punching him but I couldn't move him.  He was fixed on hurting him.' 'I wish I had never met him,' she added in her victim statement. The court heard during the trial how Johnson was in a relationship with Ms Dobson for two years before she broke up with him due to his possessive behaviour. Johnson was sentenced after he was convicted by a jury of attempted murder. Mr Justice Males, sentencing, said the attack could easily have killed Mr Spinks. The judge said: 'The injuries which Christopher Spinks suffered were very severe. He had deep cuts to his nose and right cheek, a deep cut down to the bone on the left side of his scalp, and a cut to his left ear which split it in two. 'He also had deep wounds on his left leg, one of which was right down to the bone, which caused significant damage to his muscles and an important nerve. The victim also sustained deep wounds on his left leg, one of which was right down to the bone, which caused significant damage to his muscles and an important nerve . 'These were serious injuries on a defenceless man which could easily have killed him.' The court heard how Johnson, 26  from  Chester-le-Street, had a stormy relationship with his ex-partner for about two years. He had a conviction for violence on Ms Dobson, and he was 'intensely jealous' of any contact she had with other men, the judge said. The unprovoked attack with the 'vicious looking machete' left Mr Spinks suffering from panic attacks, having thoughts of suicide and requiring a leg brace, the judge said. Johnson, who has a young daughter, had sent a series of threatening text messages to his ex-partner in the hours before he travelled five miles to her home. He wrote: '(Mr Spinks) wants to hope he's not at our house like defo', and, 'tell him I'm waiting for him even if I have got to wait for ages'. The judge said: 'So there was a degree of planning and deliberation about your conduct and you wanted Holly Dobson to know what you were doing.' He imposed a life-long restraining order preventing Johnson from going within 100 metres of his ex-girlfriend or Mr Spinks. Outside court, Detective Inspector Gavin Heckles said: 'This was a savage and premeditated assault on Mr Spinks, which left him with serious psychological as well as physical injuries. The judge said the attack could easily have killed the defenceless Mr Spinks (now recovered after the horrific assault) 'Johnson showed no remorse at any time during our investigation and interviews with him, and the comments from the judge summed up perfectly just how serious this was. 'I hope the substantial sentence will provide at least a measure of comfort to Mr Spinks and his family.' Mr Spinks, who suffered serious, gaping flesh wounds, said he had gone to bed on the evening of the attack and woke up in hospital. 'They told me that someone tried to kill me in my sleep. I didn't know how to take it. I couldn't believe it, I was laughing when they first told me. I thought I was dreaming. It was a big shock.' He branded his attacker a 'coward' in a victim statement to the court and speaking after the verdict said his life had been 'ruined' by the assault. 'I have suffered leg injuries, facial injuries and I had one of my front teeth kicked out. I had to stay in hospital for a couple of days while I got stitched up so I could come out. 'I am still recovering now. I have to keep my leg in a brace. The attack has made me scared all the time. 'Holly and I split up because of the attack but we stayed good friends. Our relationship was good up until that point. 'I'm happy he can't hurt anyone else.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"An office worker who lost 13 stone thanks to a gastric bypass says the saggy skin left by the operation makes it impossible for her to attract a boyfriend. After ballooning to  24 stone, Leeanne Collins, 25, had a gastric bypass operation in a bid to improve her health, and lost more than half her body weight afterwards. She was delighted to shrink from a size 28 to a size 12 – but her happiness soon faded when she was left with mounds of saggy skin which she says have utterly destroyed her confidence. Now, Miss Collins is terrified to bare her body in front of men and is desperate for the NHS to pay for a tummy tuck so she can find love. Leeanne Collins, 25, ballooned to 24st (left) after gorging on crisps, chocolates and fizzy drinks. After a gastric bypass in 2009, she lost 13st, more than half her body weight (right) After the procedure, Miss Collins was left with a huge apron of saggy skin she says no amount of exercise will fix (left and right). She says the skin has ruined her confidence and is desperate for a procedure on the NHS to remove it, but her application has been turned down twice already . Miss Collins, who is pictured before her weight loss, used to eat a typical meal of chips, chicken and curry sauce for lunch washed down with fizzy drinks. Now she eats a chicken salad sandwich and water . Miss Collins, of east London, said: 'No amount of exercise would shift my saggy tummy and I've been turned down twice by the NHS for a tummy tuck. She said: 'I have no trouble attracting men with my clothes on but I daren't let them see my body in the buff.' Miss Collins has struggled with her weight since she was nine years old, when she developed a habit of secretly eating sweets and cakes. She said: 'My mum always fed me healthy food at home but at school I ate whatever I wanted. 'Over the years it got worse and worse. I was eating crisps, sweets, cakes, fizzy drinks and chocolate in secret.' The crunch point came when she was 16. On a school trip, staff told her to leave a rollercoaster as she was too fat to ride it, embarrassing her in front of her whole class. Miss Collins now weighs 11st (pictured left and right), shrinking from a size 28 to a size 12. But she says her saggy skin has ruined her confidence with men. She said: 'I have no trouble attracting men with my clothes on but I daren't let them see my body in the buff.' Miss Collins developed sleep apnoea and asthma as a result of being obese (she is pictured, left, at 24st). Her health problems disappeared when she lost weight after the gastric bypass procedure . She said: 'I was mortified - I was sat on the ride and the safety bar couldn't close over my stomach. 'Staff made me get off, as I walked away everyone in the queue fell silent and my cheeks burned with shame. 'I was a confident person and I tried to shrug it off. Losing weight will be the answer to many people's prayers. But they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side-effect: excess skin. This hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin, the dermis, which contains two proteins: elastin, which helps it retract, and collagen, for strength. When the skin is stretched too much through weight gain, these proteins tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength. Unfortunately, while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat, the skin cannot retract. It is linked unpleasant health problems, from infections to back pain. Doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body. Factors that affect how much skin is left include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had. Many patients patients develop an 'apron' of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs. This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems. One of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry. Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery. 'On the surface it seemed like my weight didn't bother me, I wouldn't listen when people called me names. But inside I was really unhappy with my body.' In adulthood Miss Collins began suffering with asthma and sleep apnoea - a condition where the walls of the throat relax during sleep and interrupt normal breathing - because of her obesity. Desperate to change, she applied for a gastric bypass on the NHS. In August 2009 Miss Collins went under the knife and within a year of having the operation had lost six stone. She said: 'It took a long time to adjust to eating less, but after a while it became normal. 'I feel fantastic now - my sleep apnea and asthma have gone. People don't realise how different your life is after a dramatic weight loss - almost nothing can stop me now.' Before her weight loss Miss Collins would typically eat a big bowl of sugary cereal for breakfast, chicken with curry sauce and chips for lunch and a large cottage pie for dinner. Throughout the day she would gorge on crisps, sweets and pour herself fizzy drinks. After the gastric bypass procedure she radically changed her diet, and now eats a slice of toast for breakfast, a chicken and salad sandwich for lunch and fresh fish with steamed vegetables for dinner. Throughout the day she snacks on fresh fruit, yogurt and crackers, drinking only water. Within two years of having her operation, Miss Collins had shed 13 stone. She now weighs 11 stone, and has managed to ditch her tent-like size 28 clothes for slinky size 12 dresses. But the rapid weight loss left Miss Collins with giant folds of saggy skin. She has applied to the NHS for a tummy tuck twice but her application has been denied both times, and her last hope is to apply for a third time this year. The cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around £15,000. She said: 'I try not to let my saggy skin get me down, but I don't feel like I have my dream body yet. I feel half finished. She says her stomach, legs and arms have lots of saggy skin which is preventing her from finding love. She said: 'I haven't been in a proper relationship since losing weight - I need to get my skin done so I can love my body' 'Both my tummy and legs have lots of really saggy skin - but no amount of exercise will shift it. 'I don't regret losing the weight, I'm so much healthier now, but I long to find love. I just don't know if I'll ever be ready to share the secret that lies beneath my clothes. 'I haven't been in a proper relationship since losing weight - I need to get my skin done so I can love my body. 'You know what they say - you need to learn to love yourself before somebody else will. 'I keep being turned down for the procedure because they want me to show that I have severe depression linked to my saggy skin. But why should I have to lie so they will fix my body? 'I've paid my tax and national insurance since I was 17 - so I've paid my way.'","Leeanne Collins, 25, ballooned to 24st after gorging on sugary junk food .

"Two carers have been jailed for scamming a 91-year-old out of £500,000 with the help of porn star Lisa Bell, pictured today at Bradford Crown Court . Two carers who scammed a 91-year-old Parkinson's sufferer out of more than £500,000 with the help of a porn star have been jailed for almost seven years in total. Wendy Bell, 57, and Amanda Carroll, 44, 'grossly' inflated the cost of Audrey Hammond's care in a 'cruel and heartless' fraud to 'filch' the wealthy widow of her savings. They were sentenced with four others at Bradford Crown Court including Bell's daughter Lisa, 30, who supplemented her income as a carer by running a private porn website. Lisa Bell, Linda Mynott, 60, and Alice Barker, 59, all received suspended jail sentences and a sixth carer, Caron Gilbert, 33, was handed a 12-month community order. Judge Colin Burn told the hearing that Wendy Bell and Carroll played a leading role in the fraud which saw Mrs Hammond pay £35,000 every four weeks for her care. They charged up to £121 an hour for round-the-clock care, roping in friends and family to help and taking over Mrs Hammond's Grade II-listed home in Cracoe, near Skipton, North Yorkshire. Computers were bought for staff, carpets were damaged, expensive cars parked outside and the pair even ran a burger van business from the property, Bradford Crown Court heard. Wendy and Lisa Bell were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud at the trial.  Wendy Bell was also convicted of a charge of fraud and was jailed for three years and six months. Carroll from Shipley, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud and one charge of conspiracy to defraud before the trial and she was jailed for three years and five months. Judge Burn He said: 'Wendy Bell and Amanda Carroll must take the central responsibility for a scheme which exposed Mrs Hammond, wealthy though she was, to massive financial loss resulting from blatant dishonesty.' None of the people employed by Bell and Carroll had any qualifications to care for a patient with Parkinson's disease. They were not appropriately registered and had not undergone checks with the Criminal Records Bureau. Mrs Hammond's late husband amassed a 'considerable fortune' in his coal merchant business and left her land and fishing rights in the Yorkshire Dales. But the carers siphoned off hundreds of thousands by overcharging, putting in fake petty cash claims and claiming for 'ghost' workers. Lisa Bell (left) and her mother Wendy (right) were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud at the trial. Wendy Bell was today jailed for three years and six months . Lisa Bell's website charges visitors more than £20 a month to view racy photos and videos of her either naked or in lingerie . As the widow's health declined, she appointed a solicitor to act as power of attorney and authorised him to write cheques on her behalf, as she was physically incapable of doing so. Giles Bridge, prosecuting, said the defendants 'created the opportunity for some carers to filch money from Mrs Hammond and line their own pockets'. Between February 2010 and September 2012, Wendy Bell and Carroll requested payment from the solicitor for work which had not been undertaken. They also made requests for inflated petty cash payments. By the time police became involved in September 2012, Mrs Hammond was paying £35,000 every four weeks for her care. This was reduced to £20,000 when a professional care company took over. Judge Burn told the court that during the two-year eight-month period, Carroll was overpaid by around £220,000, Wendy Bell by around £139,000, Lisa Bell by around £50,000, Mynott by around £39,000, Barker by around £52,000 and Gilbert by around £16,000. Opening the case last month, Stephen Wood, prosecuting, said: 'There is no doubt that Mrs Hammond was subjected to a cruel and heartless fraud by the greedy. People she trusted to look after her betrayed that trust.' Lisa Bell, from Cullingworth, West Yorks, was handed a 15-month jail sentence suspended for two years. Judge Colin Burn told the hearing that Wendy Bell (left) and Amanda Carroll (right) played a leading role in the fraud . She was also given a four-month curfew order and told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Her porn website charges visitors more than £20 a month to view racy photos and videos of her either naked or in lingerie. Mynott, Gilbert, and Barker all from Keighley, West Yorks, all admitted conspiracy to defraud before the trial. Mynott was handed a seven month jail sentence suspended for two years and was made subject to a four-month curfew order. Barker was given a nine-month prison sentence suspended for two years and told to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work. Detective Constable Shane Martin, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'This was one of the worst cases of financial abuse I have ever seen. 'These so-called carers abused their position of trust and responsibility, provided a poor standard of care and plundered the unsuspecting victim's bank account, believing they would never be found out. 'Their victim was a frail and elderly lady who trusted the women to look after her in her own home, a situation which has to come with a high degree of trust. These women abused that trust with impunity. 'Today's outcome should send a very clear message to those who seek to take advantage of the elderly and vulnerable. Justice will be done and you will be made to face the consequences of your actions.'","Wendy Bell, 57, and Amanda Carroll, 44, inflated cost of 91-year-old's care .

"You can't escape Fifty Shades of Grey at the moment as its promotional machine has been gearing up for the film's release this weekend. But despite the book's huge global success, critics  have called the film adaptation boring, drawn-out and a turn-off. In a report for Time Magazine, Eliana Dockterman attributes this to the fact women, and men, respond differently to  written and visual sexual stimulus. Scroll down for video . In a report for Time, Eliana Dockterman claims the Fifty Shades of Grey film will not be as popular as the book because women, and men, respond differently to written and visual sexual stimulus. This is due to the way their brains are hardwired to find a partner. Dakota Johnson as protaganist Anastasia Steele is pictured . The film centres around 'naive' virgin and English student Anastasia Steele and her relationship with billionaire business owner Christian Grey. Mr Grey enjoys sadomasochism and the books feature numerous sex scenes between the two involving handcuffs, whips and other bondage materials. In 2012, the first book in E.L James' trilogy became the best-selling book of all time. But is the film just a poor adaptation, or does the problem lie in the way the brains of men and women are wired? A recent study found the Fifty Shades trilogy can have a dramatic effect on the personalities of young women. The researchers said young adult women who read the book are more likely than non-readers to exhibit signs of eating disorders and have a verbally abusive partner. As part of the study, more than 650 women aged 18 to 23 were surveyed about their relationships and sexuality. Those who read the first Fifty Shades novel were 25 per cent more likely to have a partner who yelled or swore at them; 34 per cent more likely to have a partner who demonstrated stalking tendencies; and more than 75 per cent more likely to have used diet aids or fasted for more than 24 hours. Those who read all three books in the series were 65 per cent more likely than nonreaders to binge drink – or drink five or more drinks on a single occasion on six or more days per month – and 63 per cent more likely to have five or more partners during their lifetime. 'There's a scientific reason women prefer to read about sex rather than see it,' explained Ms Dockterman. She quotes Ogi Ogas, a neuroscientist who said that men base their sexual decisions on visual clues about whether a woman is healthy and attractive. This is because, biologically and evolutionary-speaking, men are wired to impregnate as many women as possible to ensure their genes are passed on far and wide. On the other hand, women are hardwired to select fewer, more specific partners based on a wider range of criteria such as long-term security, intelligence and other genetic traits. As a result men get more pleasure from visual stimulus, including pornographic pictures and films, but women are more aroused by reading and learning about male characters over time. Ms Dockterman added  this isn't a new phenomenon, however, and books including Jane Eyre and Gone with the Wind used similar characters and narratives - albeit much more tame in graphic content compared to the Fifty Shades trilogy. 'What is he thinking? Will he be here for the long haul? These are not questions you can get immediate answers to,' Mr Ogas told Time. 'That's why a  book is better suited to this fantasy than a video. It perfectly replicates that puzzle.' This has also been seen to a certain extent in the reviews written by male and female critics. Neuroscientist Ogi Ogas said men base their sexual decisions on visual clues about whether a woman is healthy and attractive. But women are hardwired to select fewer, more specific partners based on a wider range of criteria. Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Ms Johnson as Anastasia Steele are pictured . Many of the male reviewers have criticised the film for not having enough sex and shots of genitals, while women have slammed the chemistry between the two lead actors. This suggest men are more interested in the visual aspects of the film, on average, but women are more concerned with dialogue and the relationship . Many of the male reviewers have criticised the film for not having enough sex and shots of genitals, while women have slammed the chemistry between the two lead actors and how believable the relationship appeared. For example, Peter Bradshaw from the Guardian said: 'There are no glimpses of a penis in this film, not in any state. It's primly off-camera. Or maybe the smoulderingly sado-obsessed hero does not have a penis.' Firefighters in London announced last week they anticipate an rise in in call-outs when the Fifty Shades of Grey film is release. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it was 'concerned' the film could lead to a 'spike' in people being stuck or trapped in handcuffs. Since April it has attended 393 incidents of this nature. LFB said people should use 'common sense' but call 999 if it is a genuine emergency. Dave Brown from LFB said: 'The Fifty Shades effect seems to spike handcuff incidents so we hope film-goers will use common sense and avoid leaving themselves red-faced. While the Daily Mail's Jan Moir wrote: 'Part of the difficulty is the lack of sexual chemistry between the two leads. 'This is a particularly acute problem in a tale of two lovers exploring a relationship that takes in the wilder shores of bondage, submission, dominance and terrible dialogue.' This suggests men are more interested in the visual aspects of the film, on average, but women are generally more concerned with dialogue. This was even the case before porn became more widespread. A 1920s study of American men and women, for example, found that 65 per cent of men compared with 20 per cent of women had carried out 'voyeuristic acts', which included peering through bedroom windows. In Helen Fisher's book The First Sex, she explained men use pornographic materials more frequently than women do. And when they fantasise, they conjure up more images of sex and genitalia. She continued that although women are also excited by visual erotica, to an extent, they are more aroused by 'romantic words, images, and themes.' This makes them twice as likely to think about a partner's emotional characteristics and when they imagine sex, they are more concerned with the sounds and smells of the experience than men are. Mark Kastleman, author of The Drug of the New Millennium-the Science of How Internet Pornography Radically Alters the Human Brain and Body, agrees. He said: 'Men are able to separate information, stimulus, emotions [and] relationships into separate compartments in their brains, while women tend to link everything together. A recent study that found the Fifty Shades trilogy (pictured) can have a dramatic effect on the personalities of young women. The researchers said young adult women who read the book are more likely than non-readers to exhibit signs of eating disorders and have a verbally abusive partner . 'Men see individual issues with parts of their brain, while women look at the holistic or multiple issues with their whole brain.' He continued that men have as much as '20 times more testosterone in their systems' than women which makes them more narrowly focused on the physical aspects of sex. 'In men, the dominant perceptual sense is vision, which is typically not the case with women. All of a woman's senses are, in some respects, more finely tuned than those of a man,' he concluded. The emotional power of Fifty Shades of Grey was also  highlighted by a recent study that found the book can have a dramatic effect on the personalities of young women. The researchers said young adult women who read the book are more likely than non-readers to exhibit signs of eating disorders and have a verbally abusive partner. Bookmakers Paddy Power has released a series of special odds surrounding the Fifty Shades of Grey film. For example, the firm is offering 20/1 odds of Anastasia being the top baby girls name in 2015. This increases to 25/1 for Christian to be the top baby boys name in 2015. By 16 February, Paddy Power are giving odds of 20/1 that the UK will declare a shortage of the morning after pill and the same odds for shortage of condoms. Women who read all three books in the series are also at increased risk of engaging in binge drinking and having multiple sex partners, the study found. 'All are known risks associated with being in an abusive relationship, much like the lead character, Anastasia, is in 'Fifty Shades,' said Amy Bonomi, the study's lead investigator. The researchers studied more than 650 women aged 18 to 24. Compared to participants who didn't read the book, those who read the first 'Fifty Shades' novel were 25 per cent more likely to have a partner who yelled or swore at them; 34 per cent more likely to have a partner who demonstrated stalking tendencies; and more than 75 per cent more likely to have used diet aids or fasted for more than 24 hours. Those who read all three books in the series were 65 per cent more likely than non-readers to binge drink - or drink five or more drinks on a single occasion on six or more days per month – and 63 per cent more likely to have five or more intercourse partners during their lifetime. Ms Bonomi said she is not suggesting the book be banned but added it is important women understand that the health behaviours assessed in the study are known risk factors for being in a violent relationship.","Report claims the Fifty Shades of Grey film won't be as popular as the book .

"The boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown has told friends of his anguish at being banned from visiting her as she fights for life. Nick Gordon has been in hiding since his girlfriend was discovered lying face down in a bathtub on January 31. Detectives have launched an investigation into how the daughter of the late singer Whitney Houston was found with injuries on her chest, as well as additional bruises on her mouth and face. But Gordon,25, has insisted it was wrong to blame him for the 21-year-old heiress's condition and that he desperately wanted to be allowed to see her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . It has emerged that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found . Sole sighting: Nick Gordon was only seen visiting Bobbi Houston's hospital once, one the day after she was found drowned. He is now pleading to be allowed to see her and denies harming her . Vigil: Bobbi Kristina's relatives, including her maternal grandmother, Cissy Houston (pictured), have been at her bedside since the drowning . Visiting: Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown visits his daughter on Thursday . He told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby. 'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know. 'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.' Gordon has opened up discussions with Bobbi's family to try to persuade them to allow him to see his girlfriend who has described him as her husband, although any marriage has been denied by her family. There has only been one public visit to her bedside by Gordon, one the day after she was found drowned at the home they shared. Since then he has not been seen at the hospital where she is being treated, although her father Bobby Brown, grandmother Cissy Houston and other relatives have been seen arriving or leaving the hospital virtually every day. The source said: 'He is frustrated, missing her and has had to sit back and feels helpless about everything. He just wants to be with her.' Bobbi's cousin Jered Brown claimed Gordon was taking legal action to force the hands of her family to allow him to visit the young woman who has been in a medically induced coma since being found unresponsive at her Atlanta home. But Gordon denied any legal moves last night and was said to be in 'constant prayer' for her recovery. His attorneys Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy released a statement which said: 'In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not. Cissy Houston (left) and Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown (right), are pictured at the hospital . Ms Brown, 21, has been in a coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since January 31, when she was found face down in a bathtub . Lost control of car: Bobbi Kristina Brown was driving a Jeep Liberty on January 27 when she lost control, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another vehicle. She was found unresponsive on January 31. The 21-year-old is seen here in an undated selfie . 'Mr Gordon's only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina . 'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon. Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.' Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. Last year, Bobbi Kristina's maternal aunt Marion Houston sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April. Jered Brown said he had been helping Gordon, who was one of two people who found her in the bathtub, by acting as a liason between him and Bobbi's family. 'We sit down and talk about things he wants my family to know and what we would love for Krissy to know, and that is that he loves her and is just waiting for her to wake up,' he told the station 11Alive . 'To be honest with you, Nick is feeling very emotional right now behind all of this. He's pretty torn about about what's going on.' He said Bobbi still needed ' a miracle' to survive and urged people to continue praying for her. She had been troubled in the days before she was taken to hospital. Four days befoe she was driving and lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty, crashing into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and transported to a hospital, according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Police had also been called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there, but officers found no evidence of an altercation, said Roswell police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Scene: Gordon and a friend discovered Bobbi Kristina in the bathtub at their home in the neighborhood of Roswell, Georgia, pictured, on January 31. She has been in a medically-induced coma ever since . Speaking out: Speaking to Fox News, Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina's aunt, has said she believes the young woman's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, should be charged in relation to her injuries . Whitney Houston was was found in a bathtub at a hotel near Los Angeles on February 11, 2012, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. The inquest ruled Houston's death was an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Bobbi was her only child, although Gordon had been 'adopted' by the singer at the age of 12. It is claimed Bobbi stands to inherit her mother's fortune of around $12 million when she reaches the age of 30.","Nick Gordon tells friends that he is desperate to be reunited with Bobbi Kristina, who is in a coma in hospital after being found face down in the bath .

"A famous tiger temple in Thailand - where Buddhist monks ride the giant cats - has been cleared of mistreating the animals who live there. More than 100 tigers are housed at the Luangtamahabua Buddhist temple in the western province of Kanchanaburi. Wildlife protection officers investigated after claims the monks were drugging the tigers - but after a three-hour inspection, no evidence of mistreatment was found. Scroll down for video . Wildlife protection officers found no evidence of mistreatment at the popular Luangtamahabua Buddhist temple in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Pictured, a monk plays with a tiger at the so-called 'Tiger Temple' Wildlife protection officials said they found no mistreatment of the more than 100 tigers at the temple . However, charges will be pursued for keeping rare birds in the compound after a raid last week found the temple was illegally keeping 38 hornbills and other protected bird species. Around 50 officials from the wildlife department and local religious affairs office, as well as soldiers, inspected the premises of the popular attraction yesterday. The so-called 'Tiger Temple' is famous for its tame-looking big cats which live alongside Buddhist monks. The monks and the veterinarian who takes care of the animals have denied allegations of drugging the creatures to keep them tame. The temple is known for the iconic image of tame-looking big cats living with Buddhist monks . A Buddhist monk feeds water to a tiger at the temple in Saiyok district in Kanchanaburi, west of Bangkok . The 'Tiger Temple' is one of Thailand's most popular attractions for tourists and is essentially a petting zoo . Cherdchai Jariyapanya, director of the regional office of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, said: 'The tigers are living in quite healthy conditions. They are well taken care of. 'They have had microchips embedded in them and the department has been informed every time a new cub is born.' The chips contain information about the lineage and medical history of the animals and are also used to help combat trafficking. Mr Cherdchai said he will report the results of the inspection to the department's director-general, who will decide whether the government will step in to take care of the tigers. He added the cost of handling the animals would be more than 20 million baht ($612,000) a year and a new facility would need to be built to support them. 'We already have a number of confiscated tigers in our custody already,' he added. Animal rights activists have expressed concerns about the welfare of animals at tourist attractions across Thailand, which has popular elephant camps, monkey shows and tiger farms. Mr Cherdchai said the police have pressed charges against the keeper of the exotic birds found on the temple's compound and will watch out for future violations of the wildlife protection laws. 'If we hear of any more complaints, we will strictly follow the law and send officials to search and make an arrest again,' he said. The temple has been accused of drugging the creatures to make them stay calm, an allegation the monks and the veterinarian who takes care of the animals, denied . Around 50 officials from the wildlife department and local religious affairs office, as well as soldiers, inspected the premises of the popular attraction yesterday . Temples in Thailand are traditional sanctuaries for stray dogs, but the presence of the tigers raised concerns . The temple  began keeping tigers in 2001 when it agreed to take care of seven Bengal tigers seized in a wildlife bust nearby. It now houses 143 tigers and cubs. Temples are traditional sanctuaries for stray dogs, but the presence of the tigers raised concerns after photographs emerged showing monks riding the animals. Buddhist monks are supposed to act modestly in all aspects of their lives - but they still come out to play with the animals in what has come to be a show for visitors. Tourists happily pet the tigers and pose for close-up photos with them, while their donations help pay for the tigers' maintenance and improvements to the temple. More than 100 tigers are housed at the Luangtamahabua Buddhist temple now after the monks first adopted seven Bengal tigers in 2001 . Cherdchai Jariyapanya said the tigers are living in 'quite healthy conditions' and are 'well taken care of'.

"The teenager driving a runaway tipper truck which killed four people including a four-year-old-girl had only qualified to drive an articulated lorry a few days before the tragic crash. Philip Potter, 19, posed for a photo holding up his hauliers licence and posted it on his Facebook page on February 4 - a day after his birthday. His father, Frederick, wrote on the website: 'Very proud day of Philip Potter passing his HGV artic test first time day after his nineteenth birthday well done - feeling happy.' Mr Potter had qualified to drive an articulated lorry just days earlier, when he posted this picture  on Facebook . Philip Potter was behind the wheel of the lorry which crashed in Bath this week, killing four. Witnesses said the vehicle's brakes appeared failed before the crash . Mr Potter is understood to have passed his HGV licence three months ago, before passing his articulated lorry licence five days before the accident. The 32-ton Scania tipper truck Mr Potter was driving careered down a steep narrow hill next to a school in Bath, Somerset, on Monday. Witnesses at the scene said it appeared that the lorry's brakes failed in the moments before the accident and Mr Potter frantically sounded his horn to alert drivers and pedestrians. He is said to have used the front walls of nearby homes to slow the vehicle down before it came to halt in a hedge and tipped onto its side. The vehicle hit  Mitzi Rosanna Steady, four, who died instantly, and  her grandmother Margaret Rogers was left fighting for her life. The lorry also collided with a Volvo at the bottom of the steep hill, killing Stephen Vaughan, 34, Phillip Allen, 52, and Robert Parker, 59, who were inside the car. The grieving widow of Mr Vaughan, Sian, has since paid tribute to her taxi driver husband 34, as a 'true gentleman' and said she was 'honoured' to have been chosen to be his wife. The couple  only married last summer in Turkey. 'We are devastated that he was taken away from us so soon,' she added in a statement released by police. Four-year-old Mitzi Steady was killed in the crash in Bath on Monday, when the lorry careered out of control . Chauffeur Stephen Vaughan (left, with wife Sian) and Phil Allen (right) were also among the four victims . Witnesses said the  brakes of the vehicle - which would not be classified as an articulated lorry - failed moments before the accident and it ended up on its side . The family of Mitzi also released a photograph of the little girl and a short statement saying: 'Mitzi Rosanna Steady, aged four, loved and missed by us all.' There are also a growing numbers of floral tributes being left at a nearby 'memorial tree' and books of condolences will be opened at libraries in Weston and Bath as the tight-knit community attempt to come to term with their grief. Mr Potter's parents declined to comment at the family farm today. A relative of Mr Potter, who asked not to be named, said: 'He's a lovely person. He's loyal and a hard working, nice man. Nobody wants to be in this situation. It is all very, very difficult. 'The last thing he would want to be involved in is a situation where there has been an accident. Nobody wants to be involved in that.' 'Steve was infectious; when he smiled, the whole room would smile. 'Myself, Steve's parents and family are very proud of the man he was, a true gentleman and we were so privileged to have been a part of his life. 'We are devastated that he was taken away from us so soon. 'We had only been married six months and I was honoured that he chose me to be his wife. Steve was dedicated to his family and his business which made him a well-respected businessman. 'Even though we are going through our loss, our hearts go out to all the other families that have lost loved ones and we would like to thank the emergency services and the local community for everything that they have done for us at this sad time.' The family member added: 'If you could change yesterday, wouldn't you just? It's like all accidents, we just wish we weren't there at that particular time. We would all change it. 'We all feel very sorry about it all.' Mr Potter, a farmer's son from Brinkworth, Wiltshire, was driving for local firm Grittenham Haulage when the crash happened. The company, whose boss has declined to comment on the incident, is licensed to use five vehicles. Locals  said Mr Potter was working out of a yard used by the haulage firm, just half a mile from his house. It is understood the truck Mr Potter was using had picked up its load of sand from Hills Quarry in Cirencester around an hour's drive from where the crash happened. The truck involved in the accident would have been classified as an HGV rather than an articulated lorry for licencing purposes. The name of the fourth victim, Robert Parker, was released by police yesterday. He, along with his colleague Phil Allen, had been picked up by chauffeur Mr Vaughan to be returned to their homes in south Wales on the day of the crash. All three died when Mr Vaughan's Volvo was hit. Both Mr Parker and Mr Allen were executives at Western Power Distribution, an electricity network firm based in Bristol. A company spokeswoman said today: 'We can confirm the tragedy in Bath on Monday has claimed the lives of two colleagues who were also among our most senior of managers – Phil Allen, our Resources and External Affairs Director – and Bob Parker, our Planning and Special Regulation Projects Manager. 'Both were very well respected by friends and staff alike and we are all deeply shocked by this tragic event. Our thoughts are with their wives and families at this very sad time.' It is thought the truck entered Lansdown Lane, where the crash happened, from the top of the hill, where a 6ft width limit is in force. However, it is understood a sign warning of the limit had been knocked over by a car some weeks earlier during icy weather. An investigation into the crash is ongoing. No arrests have been made. Police are still investigating the incident. The lorry was removed from the scene the night after the crash .","Truck careered out of control before the crash in Bath this week .

"A father-of-three with motor neurone disease, whose ventilator prevents him from being able to speak, has been given the opportunity to communicate independently for the first time in 15 years. Technology and media company, Not Impossible Labs, which was founded by Melbourne born Elliot Kotek and Mick Ebeling from Arizona, made it their mission to ensure Don Moir was able to independently renew his vows on his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife Lorraine. A short documentary explaining the trials and tribulations of their project, captured the heart-warming moment the farmer from rural Canada was able to write his wife a love letter and tell her he loves her for the first time in 15 years. Scroll down for video . Don Moir, a father-of-three with motor neurone disease, was able to independently tell his wife he loved her for the first time in 15 years . Mr Moir was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 1995. The disease forced him to rely on a wheelchair and in 1999 he was fitted with a ventilator to help him breathe. 'I'm not even sure he realised that he wasn't going to be able to speak, but I remember explaining that to him: ""if you go on the ventilator, you won't be able to speak anymore"",' Lorraine said. 'At that point, it was very difficult.' Don's family did their best to adapt to his progressive illness and learnt how to run the family farm according to his instructions, but they remain humble about the emotional toll it has taken on them. 'He's constantly losing abilities every week, like what he could do last week he can't do this week and next week you know it's going to be something else, but you don't know what,' Lorraine said. Technology and media company, Not Impossible Labs, which was founded by Melbourne born Elliot Kotek (left) and Mick Ebeling (right) from Arizona, designed the program to allow Don to communicate independently . Mr Moir was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 1995. The disease forced him to rely on a wheelchair and in 1999 he was fitted with a ventilator to help him breathe . Engineer and Not Impossible volunteer Javed Gangjee was determined to help Don communicate independently after hearing his story, but was set back due to the farmer's lack of experience with technology. His wife explains in the documentary: 'Don has never touched a computer, he doesn't even know how to turn one on'. Undeterred, Mr Gangjee said: 'a year ago I made Don a promise; that I will find an answer that works for him specifically.' 'When I look at Don - that could be my uncle, that could be my dad - what right do I have to do nothing about it.' The Not Impossible team thus created an electronic version of a letter-board chart that Don and his wife had been using to communicate since he first lost the ability to speak. 'I'm not even sure he realised that he wasn't going to be able to speak, but I remember explaining that to him... at that point, it was very difficult,' his wife Lorraine said . Don's family did their best to adapt to his progressive illness and Lorraine (pictured) learnt how to run the family farm according to his instructions, but they remain humble about the emotional toll it has taken on them . 'Don had a letter board that was divided up into four quadrants that enabled him to have a bit of shorthand with his wife and kids because when he looked into the corner on the left it could only be a certain letter that fit to form a certain word,' Elliot Kotek told Daily Mail Australia. 'Due to his technology barrier, the program gave him a very familiar thing to look at because it looked just like his letter sheet and it would calibrate, so it would scroll through these letters and if he then looks to the centre it pulls the letter in to the centre. 'Not only does it speak the word or sentence for him, but it has got predictive text, just like our phones do, which continues to get smarter like our phones do, and that speeds up his communication. 'It's a new piece of technology also based on eye recognition and it's really the software that's the hero here.' After almost three years of development the program was finally complete in August 2014 and Don was able to renew his vows. Engineer and Not Impossible volunteer Javed Gangjee was determined to help Don communicate independently after hearing his story, but was set back due to the farmer's lack of experience with technology . 'Don has never touched a computer, he doesn't even know how to turn one on,' Lorraine said . 'My dear Lorraine, I can't imagine life without you. You have made the last 25 years fly by and the last 20 with ALS more bearable. I am looking forward to the next 25 years. Love Don.' 'He was pretty excited. Lorraine told us: ""he's blinking like crazy!"",' Mr Kotek said. But the beauty of the program does not stop there. The tech geniuses are now working on designing a voice based on Don's actual voice from old film footage of him in order to personalise the computer's voice and minimise the robotic sounds. 'The next stage they're working on is for him to be able to email from the device so that he can keep in contact with friends and people you don't get to see because you're not as mobile as you used to be. He'll be able to communicate with anyone in the world and not just the two people in the room with him,' Mr Kotek said. The Not Impossible team thus created an electronic version of a letter-board chart that Don and his wife had been using to communicate since he first lost the ability to speak . The program is based on his letter sheet and calibrates - scrolling through letters and pulling them into the centre when he looks into the centre. It then speaks the word or sentence for him and also includes predictive text which continues to get smarter and speeds up his communication . Not Impossible Labs will also have the program available for download online by anyone, for free. 'Javed wants to go around the whole country making custom interfaces for all sorts of people. Like, for someone with tunnel vision, he wants to customise the program for them,' Mr Kotek said. 'Don has Lorraine, but not everyone has a Lorraine. We want people to look at all the technology available to them and know that they can use it and adapt it to make life a lot easier and convenient. We still are a really small team of people and we manage to deliver real impact on people's lives and if we can inspire others to help someone in their community then it's huge. 'If we can make it downloadable to use for free then others can look at it and improve it so that there are local answers for people who are lacking communication tools.' Don's Voice is just one of many projects that Not Impossible currently has in the works. Their process of helping people is a simple one: find a problem, solve it by bringing together the best creative minds, get big companies involved to fund the set up costs in exchange for exposure, make it a sustainable solution and then spread the message far and wide. The program allowed Don to independently renew his vows on his 25th wedding anniversary with Lorraine . Not Impossible Labs will also have the program available for download online by anyone, for free. '[Now] others can look at it and improve it so that there are local answers for people who are lacking communication tools,' Mr Kotek said . 'What happens is, people send us stories or we find stories where access has been limited to someone,' Mr Kotek explained. 'It could be physical limitations, like an inability to communicate, it could be geographic, or it could just be financial where the solution is not available because it's just so expensive they can't afford it. As for Don and Lorraine, while his independence has bene given a boost, the technology is only another chapter in their love story. 'When he first used the program to say ""I love you"", Lorraine said to us: ""Oh, you know, he tells me he loves me all the time"",' Mr Kotek said. 'They really are amazing. Her resolve is incredible. It's hard to believe but they seem to really not have missed a beat.' Don's program will be available for download here.","Don Moir can communicate independently for the first time since he was forced onto a ventilator in 1999 due to his illness .

"Police have asked parents in South Florida to check their children's social media after three youths were accused of creating an Instagram account to post naked photos of other minors. Two boys, aged 12 and 15, and a 13-year-old girl were arrested by Pembroke Pines police on Thursday after a 10-week investigation. The trio faces charges of electronic transmission of child pornography. The social media account encouraged its 500 followers to post nude and sexually explicit photos of minors to 'expose' them, police said. Arrested: Three youngsters, aged 12, 13 and 15, have been arrested on child porn charges for allegedly setting up an Instagram page that shared photos of naked minors and including their personal information . The posts included their names and personal information, and many followers posted cruel comments in response to the images. 'The Pembroke Pines Police Department urges the community to pay close attention to their children's online activity,' Sgt. Angela Goodwin said in a news release Thursday. Sergeant Drew Jacobs told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that he didn't know what prompted the investigation, how long the account had been active, or how many young people were exploited. 'All I know is it's multiple,' he said. Another spokesman, Sergeant Carlos Corretjer, said Friday the investigation is ongoing but no other arrests were imminent. He declined to discuss further details of the case. Authorities said the charges could be felonies, depending on what the children are doing in the photographs. Parents who think their children may have been exploited can contact Pembroke Pines police or any other law enforcement agency.","Two boys, 12 and 13, and a girl, 13, were arrested by Pembroke Pines, Florida police on Thursday for electronic transmission of child porn .

"A judge described a teenage rape victim as ‘extremely foolish’ and ‘unwise’ for getting very drunk as he jailed the two men who attacked her. Craig Whitelaw and Kristofer McLaren, both 21, raped the 18-year-old student in an alley after leading her from a nearby nightclub in an ‘inebriated’ condition. Earlier the young woman had been seen ‘stumbling’ around and ‘throwing herself’ at men inside the club, Teesside Crown Court was told. Jailed: Craig Whitelaw, left, and Kristofer McLaren, right, both 21, are beginning nine-year jail sentences for 'a rape of the most squalid kind' after they attacked a woman they had just met on the dancefloor of a nightclub . After her 50-minute ordeal the victim was dishevelled, distressed and covered in blood, with cuts and bruises to her back. Jailing both men for nine years, Mr Justice Males said that the victim was ‘extremely foolish,’ commenting: ‘She became so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation.’ But he also told the defendants: ‘There should be no doubt what you did was still rape, and rape of the most squalid kind. ‘Your victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated. But it was you, and only you, who deliberately took advantage of her condition ... to see what fun you could have with her. 'It's just lasses attention-seeking': What Whitelaw, pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing, said of the victim after he was arrested by police . ‘It was you who decided to treat her body as a plaything on which to act out your sordid fantasies of having a threesome.’ The case comes at a time of huge controversy over the rape laws and the issue – which featured in the conviction of footballer Ched Evans – of a victim being too drunk to consent. The court heard the woman kissed McLaren and Whitelaw, and CCTV showed them ‘leading her outside’ within 15 minutes of meeting her at Club Amadeus in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. Paul Newcombe, prosecuting, told the jury the men saw her as ‘an easy target’ and ignored her pleas that she wanted to go back to her friends as they went outside. The pair bragged to a taxi driver about the ‘threesome’ as they left the scene last August and exchanged jokey texts about what they had done. One described the incident as ‘funny as ****’. Abattoir worker Whitelaw admitted downing more than a dozen pints of lager as well as a vodka and cola. McLaren told police that he had had seven pints. The victim was later found to have blood alcohol levels that were double the legal driving limit. The jury convicted each man of a charge of rape, and Whitelaw of a count of sexual assault. They were cleared of another rape offence. When Whitelaw was arrested, he admitted having sex, but claimed it was consensual, and said: ‘It’s just lasses attention-seeking.’ McLaren, a former sales worker who had been due to study law at university, later admitted having intercourse. He initially told police: ‘I saw what went on, but I had no part in it.’ After the case Katie Russell from Rape Crisis said the judge’s comments about the victim being extremely foolish were ‘unhelpful’. But she added: ‘The judge makes it clear that 100 per cent of responsibility for this crime is down to these two men.’ Inebriated: Whitelaw and McLaren had been drinking for most of the day before going to Club Amadeus, pictured, a popular dance venue in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, where they met their victim . Clare Phillipson, of Wearside Women In Need which supports victims of sexual and domestic violence, said: ‘The only person responsible for rape is the rapist.’ This week research by the Office for National Statistics showed that more than a quarter of the public believe victims of rape or sex attacks are at least ‘a little bit responsible’ if they were drunk. Among 16 to 19-year-olds the proportion rises to one in three. Last month the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must ‘challenge’ the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been ‘drinking.’ The number of recorded sexual offences is at a 10-year high, official figures show. In the year to March 2014 there were a total of 64,205 sex crime incidents across England and Wales, an increase of a fifth on the previous year. Within that, the number of rapes increased 26 per cent to 20,745 incidents, while the number of other sexual offences increased 17 per cent fo 43,460 incidents. The Office for National Statistics said the increases may in part be because victims are more willing to come forward after the high-profile prosecutions of public figures such as Rolf Harris and Fred Talbot. 'While some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the historical crimes reported as part of Operation Yewtree, there is evidence to suggest that there has been a wider ""Yewtree effect"",' the ONS said in a statement. 'This refers to an increased willingness on the part of victims of sexual offences that are not directly connected to Yewtree to come forward to report both historical and recent sexual offences.'","Craig Whitelaw and Kristofer McLaren used their victim 'as a plaything'

It is moved using a pendulum system that shifts its centre of gravity . Guardbot was created by a research team in Stamford, Connecticut, and is currently being tested with the US Marines. The secret to its efficiency is a patented drive mechanism. A controlled pendulum keeps the center of gravity very close to the inside surface of the sphere. At rest, the centre of gravity is close to the ground. To create momentum, a built-in motor raises the pendulum. This changes the center of gravity and GroundBot begins to roll in the direction that the pendulum has been moved. Not only does it take very little energy to drive GroundBot, but virtually no noise is generated either. So GroundBot moves around without drawing attention to itself. Source: Rotundus . According to Defense One, the machine can swim over water at about four miles (six kilometres) per hour, as its low density allows it to float. It can then roll along a beach at up to a 30 degree incline at 20 miles (32km) per hour. It weighs just 55lbs (25kg), with cameras on board allowing a remote driver to see where they are going. The spherical design allows for its interior to be protected, with sand or even dangerous gas unable to get inside to damage the electronics. It runs on a rechargeable battery, with around eight to 16 hours of activity available depending on the mission profile, and it takes about three to four hours to recharge. Its cameras give it a 360-degree field of vision, while it can carry cargo weighing up to 4.4lbs (two kilograms). According to GuardBot Inc, the design was originally intended to be used for a space planetary mission on Mars - but has since been repurposed for use on Earth.

Treads on the sphere (shown) also help it grip the land when it rolls . ‘GuardBot is the only known spherical unmanned amphibious vehicle systems that can navigate upstream,’ the company says on their website. According to Defense One, in order to steer it ‘uses a nine-axis stabilization, “pendulum motion” propulsion system, which moves the bot forward by shifting the center of gravity back and forth and a variety of steering algorithms.’ Amazingly, the whole design is also scalable. A GuardBot could be made as small as four inches (10cm) across, and as large as nine feet (2.7 metres). The prototype, meanwhile, will be six feet (1.8 metres). For now, GuardBot is driven around by a remote operator, but the team ultimately want to make it autonomous so that you can pick a spot on a map, and it can get there by itself.","US company is developing an autonomous drone shaped like a sphere .

"Nearly one-year to the day since the scandal that cost Ray Rice his position with the Baltimore Ravens, the embattled football player begged forgiveness as he left the city he said gave his family the best years of their lives. The statement thanked and apologized to fans, the city of Baltimore, his former team, and even Raven's owner Steve Bisciotti. The statement comes as Rice plans to leave Maryland to return to his home state of New York. Seen here with wife Janay, Rice thanked and apologized to fans, the city of Baltimore, his former team, and even Raven's owner Steve Bisciotti as he prepared to leave town for him home state of New York .

The Baltimore Sun reports that  while Rice has been a free agent since November when the NFL lifted his suspension, he has yet to get close to signing with another team. Rice's career was effectively ended after surveillance video captured a February 2015 incident in which he assaulted now-wife Janay in a casino elevator in New Jersey. The NFL lifted the ban on Rice in November and allowed him to become a free agent but he remains untouched by any team . Rice told his fans that 'one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare' 'Dear Baltimore, . This is not a farewell or goodbye. The last seven years that my family and I have spent in Baltimore have by far been the best of our lives. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all for the love and support you’ve shown my family and I throughout my football career. 'We’ll always be grateful for the love we’ve received from all of our fans and supporters, and for winning a Super Bowl. To all the kids who looked up to me, I’m truly sorry for letting you down, but I hope it’s helped you learn that one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare. 'There is no excuse for domestic violence, and I apologize for the horrible mistake I made. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and I hope to make a positive difference in people’s lives by raising awareness of this issue.

"There are people on the internet who enjoy listening to a cat purring on YouTube. They were, up until now, a niche group, content to listen to their unique choice of soundtrack undisturbed. But now YouTube has targeted cat lovers everywhere by claiming one cat's purr is infringing the copyright of music giants, EMI and PRS for Music. Scroll down for video . YouTube has targeted cat lovers everywhere by claiming one cat's purr is infringing the copyright of music giants, EMI and PRS for Music. The offending piece was an hour-long, audio-only YouTube upload of a cat named Phantom, uploaded in March by Digihaven . The offending piece was an hour-long, audio-only YouTube upload of a cat named Phantom, posted in March by Digihaven. The video was flagged by YouTube's Content ID system as possibly using a song called Focus. TorrentFreak reported that by 'claiming' the video, those rights holders disabled Digihaven's ability to make money from it through advertising. Content ID works by automatically scanning videos for audio and video content deemed 'infringing' by those who own it. Digihaven has since filed a dispute and was partially successful, with EMI lifting its claim.'Phantom is currently independent, but looking to sign on with an indie label,' he said. 'Phantom's lawyer filed a complaint, looking for 10 lbs of catnip in damages' As well as issuing a warning to YouTubers, Content ID immediately starts diverting advertising revenue from the video creator to whoever filed the claim. Last year, the system came under attack after thousands of notices were sent to YouTube gamers, claiming their videos were in violation of copyright, and are owned by someone else. Phantom was accused of a 12-second video loop infringement violation, in the video which had been viewed less than 3,000 times. Digihaven has since filed a dispute and was partially successful, with EMI lifting its claim. 'Phantom is currently independent, but looking to sign on with an indie label,' he said.

The Irish word for film, scannán, was being used as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material . The Irish word for film, scannán, seems innocuous enough to Gaeilgeoirs. But a group of YouTube users has been using it as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material. The issue was highlighted after an Irish media student searched for 'scannán' and the plural 'scannáin' only to find pornographic footage featuring Asian women. The films, disguised using various Irish language titles, were uploaded by four different accounts which were all registered in October. Connemara-based Maitíú Ó Coimín, a journalist with the Irish language website Tuairisc, first reported the issue after his flatmate found the material. 'My flatmate is a media student in Galway who was looking up [the Irish word for film] on YouTube for a project,' Mr Coimín told the BBC. 'I looked a bit further into it, and there were about 15 to 20 films of a questionable nature.' Mr Coimín added that the accounts were probably not owned by Irish speakers – or Gaeilgeoirs - as the phrasing in the description suggests an online translation tool was used.","Offending piece was an hour-long, audio of a cat named Phantom .

"The popular View-Master toy, beloved of children from the 1960s onwards, has got a modern makeover. Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google on the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’. Scroll down for video . View-Master gets a make-over! Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. An illustration of the new device is shown . The plastic body of the device has been given a sleek and less angular look than previous models, but still includes a slot for film reels. To release the phone’s virtual reality features, an Android smartphone running Mattel’s app is needed. The smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel,meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play. The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive. Mattel says that its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ‘engaging field trips’ so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in ‘photospheres’. By pairing an ‘experience reel’ with a smartphone, children ‘will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,’ according to Mattel. According to the View-Master description of the experience on its new website, users of the device will feel like they are inside the scene. It says: 'Move your head. Look around. Embark on immersive 360-degree journeys exploring and learning about the world through stunning visuals. 'Take a virtual field trip to Paris and sit in the shadows of the Eiffel Tower as it soars above you. Visit historic Alcatraz Island and interact with your surroundings to discover fun facts. 'Travel through time and space in ways you never thought possible. Watch as the solar system comes to life on your kitchen table or share with a friend to view the constellations overhead.' Originally conceived in 1938, the View-Master, a handheld device showing 3D slides, was originally aimed at adults, but became a popular toy in the 1960s (an old version of the toy is shown) Children of the 1960s and onwards have marvelled at slides showing everything from 3D scenes of the world (two examples are shown) to cartoon characters though their View-Master toy. New version of the disk to be used in the new device will cost $15 (£10) for a themed pack of four . In 1938, cameraman William Gruber produced 3-D colour slides for stereoscopes - which were popular in 19th century homes – using two cameras strapped together. An encounter with Harold Graves, president of Sawyer's Photographic Services in the Oregon Caves National Monument led to a partnership a year later. They came up with the View-Master – a new way of viewing tourist attractions in America – which was sold to adults in camera shops. It was only in the 1960s that the View-Master became a toy, and afterwards, cheap reels were produced showing scenes across the world, Disneyland and cartoon characters in ‘3D’. Today, the toy is produced by Fisher Price - part of the Mattel group. ‘The View-Master was first introduced at the 1939 World's Fair in New York, giving consumers access to spectacular 3D worlds by simply selecting a reel and looking through a device,’ said Doug Wadleigh, SVP and global brand general manager, Toy Box at Mattel. ‘By working with Google's Cardboard platform, we are now able to take that experience even further bringing the discovery and immersive viewing experience of the View-Master to the digital age. ‘Combining technology and innovation with this classic toy gives kids an enhanced experience allowing for play opportunities not yet imagined through new, digitally curated content.’ The device itself is set to be released in autumn for $30 (£20), with reels sold in themed packs of four for $15 (£10). Mattel told MailOnline the toy will come to the UK early next year. A sample reel that will come with the toy will include a gallery of classic View-Master images, such as a journey into space with a tour inside a space shuttle. Star Wars packs may be in the pipeline, because Mattel senior vice president Doug Wadleigh told USA Today: ‘We're creatively trying to figure out ways to use the old imagery in ways that enhance the new experience.’ Mattel will also work with Google Cardboard developers to create new content. Last week, Google and toy maker Mattel sent out a retro-themed invite that hinted the toy might be getting a hi-tech makeover. Many commentators correctly guessed that Google's Cardboard would be the basis for the new View-Master . South Korean electronics firm LG has also worked with Google to make a plastic virtual reality device based on Cardboard. It will be given away free with the firm’s G3 smartphones from this month, enabling owners to play on VR-compatible apps and games. The smartphone slots into the plastic gadget’s viewer, which has two holes for users to peer through to see action on the phone’s screen. South Korean electronics firm LG has also worked with Google to make a plastic virtual reality device called VR for G£ (pictured) based on Cardboard . The design of ‘VR for G3’ deviceis based on the blueprint for Google Cardboard. The neodymium ring magnet on the side of the VR for G3 works with the magnetic gyroscope sensor in the G3 to select applications and scroll through menus without touching the display. ‘While still in its infancy, this is just the beginning of the virtual reality movement which until recently was expensive and inaccessible to everyday consumers,” said Chris Yie, vice president and head of marketing communications at the LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. ‘By leveraging Google Cardboard, not only are regular consumers able to participate in the VR experience, we’ll be able to introduce this technology to future developers who may one day show us how VR can be used to improve our lives.’ The toy is a tool for Google to get a younger audience into virtual reality. Mike Jazayeri, Product Director for Google Cardboard said that the toy will ‘make immersive virtual reality experiences as accessible as possible for everyone.’ ‘Many of us on the Google Cardboard team grew up playing with View-Master, so we were excited to collaborate with Mattel and to see the viewer evolve and work with Google Cardboard,’ he added. The device was teased in an invite last week, where many commentators correctly guessed that Google would base the toy on its Cardboard project. Last summer, the Mountain View-based tech firm revealed a virtual reality headset made of cardboard, which was given out to attendees of the firm's annual developer conference. It used a mobile phones as the display, with a special app to show 3D images and video. Google seems to be intent of winning the hearts and minds of children, having announced last week that it has acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic. Google has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome, YouTube and search, which are set to be released this year. There was some speculation that Google may have re-focused its ‘Cardboard’ project for children. Last summer, Google revealed a virtual reality headset made of cardboard (pictured) but it wasn't commercialised . What you'll need to make a Google Cardboard virtual reality device...

"A woman who was shot by her stepdaughter's ex-boyfriend because she wouldn't let the girl spend time with him has died . Mary Lou Hutson, 55, died  after a long battle against the injuries she sustained when Preston Pollard, 23, drove 15 hours to her house in Marion County, Florida, early Christmas morning and shot her. After a month and a half in hospital, Mrs Huston died Thursday. The official cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, the Marion County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online. Pollard, an Air Force trainee from Venus, Texas, also shot Mrs Hutson's husband Richard, 36, when he stormed into the house after midnight. Mary Lou Hutson, 55, died after more than a month and a half struggling against gunshot wounds inflicted in an attack by her stepdaughter Rose's estranged boyfriend Preston Pollard, 23 . The man's 18-year-old ex-girlfriend Rose Courter managed to run for help after locking her three nieces in a bathroom to keep them safe. The killer's blue 2002 Honda Civic later careened off the highway and into the wounds after he shot himself in the head when Florida Highway Patrol tried to pull him over going 70mph. Mrs Hutson initially survived the attack, which killed her husband, and was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery. She had opened the door but found no one outside, according to detectives. Pollard was wearing dark clothing and a mask and shot the mother twice after she turned around from speaking to someone inside, the Ocala Star Banner reported. Pollard drove more than 1,000 miles from near Fort Worth, Texas, to central Florida before shooting the Mrs Huston and her husband Richard, 36 . Pollard's blue 2002 Honda Civic later crashed off the highway heading towards Texas after he shot himself in the head when police tried to stop him . Pollard shot Mrs Huston (left) before killing Mr Hutson in their Ocala, Florida, home on Christmas Day just after midnight . The shooter is then thought to have entered the house and shot Mr Hutson. Pollard's father Stephen said that his son had bought a plane ticket for Ms Courter to come to Texas, and later learned that she could not come, according to WFAA. He said that his son, who recently completed Air Force basic training, did not own a gun. The elder Pollard maintained that his son was driving to see his girlfriend rather than going more than 1,000 miles from near Fort Worth to central Florida to shoot the Hutsons. Police found a .22 caliber handgun in Pollard's car after his crash. Marion County sheriff's officials said that the estranged boyfriend had made threats towards the Hutsons and Ms Courter during the month of December. Police say they know who shot the Hutsons, but still have follow up to do for the case. Police believe that Mrs Huston was shot twice after answering the door and originally not finding anyone there .","Mary Lou Hutson, 55, of Ocala, Florida, died from gunshot head wound .

"A mother has slammed her son's Texas middle school for including a question about infidelity in his homework. Patricia Galvan, who helps her 12-year-old son with his school work every night, said she was shocked when she looked over the seventh-grader's science assignment. On a worksheet about genetics, one question read: . 'One of Opal's children is born with shocking red hair. Is Orville the father of this child?

Not happy: Patricia Galvan said she was shocked when her son's seventh-grade science homework included a question about infidelity. Another assignment asked him to set up a fake Match.com profile, she said . 'Inappropriate': The genetics question suggested that the mother of a newborn child had had an affair . The question left her 'appalled', Galvan told WTVR. 'I was very bothered by it,' she said. 'I'm now having to explain to my child about being unfaithful - why do I have to explain that to my 12-year-old?' The boy, who attends Harry F. Byrd Middle School in Henrico, was also given a Social Studies assignment in which he had to study a character from the 1920s and then go 'speed dating' with other class members. As part of the assignment, he also needed to create a Match.com page for the person. 'To even research what is Match.com, that opens up a whole other thing,' his mother complained. Apology: A spokesperson for Harry F. Byrd Middle School agreed the assignment should be changed . A spokesman from Henrico County Public Schools told WTVR that they 'agreed that some of the wording was not appropriate for the classroom'. 'We are thankful that the parent brought the issue to our attention, and we will be working to provide additional reminders that ensure all instructional materials are age-appropriate,' they said.

"For 20 years he has sung out plaintively in search of a friend, without getting any reply. Now an expedition is being planned to find and study the world’s loneliest whale, who is simply known as 52. Despite listening to the animal's abnormally high song of 52 hertz for over 20 years, researchers have never seen what it looks like. Scroll down for video . A team of scientists and documentary makers will attempt to find 'the loneliest whale in the world' in autumn. The creature has been calling out at a frequency not used by any other whales in the North Pacific Ocean for the last 20 years. A stock image of a fin whale is shown . The unknown male whale is called 'lonely' because he appears to communicate at a frequency not used by any other whale in the North Pacific, and so far, it is not thought to have ever got a response to his songs. Possible partners may not be able to hear him, or his song may be so different from their own that they can’t understand it, but this has not stopped 52 singing into oblivion. Experts believe the huge mammal is most likely a fin whale, but he could be a blue whale, or a hybrid of the two species. In order to learn more about the whale, Josh Zeman, a 40-year-old film maker based in Los Angeles, has launched a Kickstarter campaign to find and tag the 52 hertz whale. Together with Entourage star, Adrian Grenier and a team of marine biologists, he aims to raise $300,000. So far the campaign has pulled in $57,465 and backers can receive everything from a 52 ringtone and mix tape inspired by the whale, to signed books, tickets to the film premiere and even a lesson to swim like a mermaid. ‘We will be mounting a 20 day expedition that will take us 400 miles off the California coast out into the open ocean,’ according to the Kickstarter page. ‘Using state of the art technology, our goal is to be the first expedition ever to tag and acoustically monitor a hybrid whale using non-invasive tags. ‘At the same time, we will also be collecting data in an effort to help scientists measure the growing threat of ocean noise pollution that is harming cetaceans all across the planet including whales’ He will also make a documentary about the trip, which is planned to take place in the autumn. The US Navy began passing recordings of whale song to scientists in the late 1980s, Discovery News reported. It picked up the haunting noises when trying to listen for submarines in the North Pacific. In 1989, Dr William Watkins of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution began to sort through the recordings and noticed that one whale's song was much higher in pitch than the others. Most male fin and blue whales sing at around 17 to 18 hertz, which is too deep for humans to hear, but the 'lonely' whale communicates at 52 hertz. When more recordings were released in the nineties, Dr Watkins studied the 52 hertz whale more closely. Dr Watkins' team was able to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season, when whales are at their most vocal and published a paper on his findings in 2004. In order to learn more about the whale, Josh Zeman (pictured left), a 40-year-old film maker based in Los Angeles, has launched a Kickstarter campaign to find and tag the 52 hertz whale. It is supported by Entourage star, Adrian Grenier (right) and a team of marine biologists . Scientists have been listening to the whale for two decades but no-one has seen it, so they are not sure exactly what species they are looking for. Experts believe the huge mammal is is most likely that it is a fin whale (pictured) but could be a hybrid of a blue and a fin whale . The immediate goal is to raise a minimum of $300,000 (£194,851) to cover the costs of a scientific trip. A 20 day expedition will travel 400 miles (644km) off the California coast into the open ocean. It's planned for autumn. Marine biologists hope to tag and monitor the sounds of a hybrid whale. 52 is thought to be a hybrid of a fin whale and blue whale. They will also collect data to help scientists shed light on whether ocean noise pollution is harming cetaceans, including whales. This is when the whale’s love-lorn predicament first captured the world’s attention and the 52 hertz animal was dubbed 'the loneliest whale in the world'. As Dr Watkins sadly died from cancer before his research captured the imagination of the public, his research assistant Mary-Ann Daher has carried on his scientific legacy. She said that the team has never seen the whale they have been studying and do not know what species it is. They do not know if it is medically unusual but she said it is obviously healthy as it has been living for at least two decades. However, when it came to musing about the creature's loneliness, Ms Daher said: 'Is he alone? I don’t know. 'People like to imagine this creature out there swimming by his lonesome, just singing away and nobody’s listening. But I can’t say that.' In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Taylor Swift floated the idea that the whale may enjoy being solitary and used it to comment on her love life. She said ‘…everybody feels so sorry for this whale – but what if this whale is having a great time?’ Mr Zeman decribed the whale as inspirational in an interview with Slate magazine, and said that he wants to find the whale for all the people who think about it. ‘It's not just about jumping in front of him and saying, “Hey, we're here!” And giving him a hug when he doesn't want one. It's more about what it means for us.’ ‘For some people, he's so lonely and for others he’s celebrating his alone-ness.' Most male blue and fin whales (pictured) sing at around 17 to 18 hertz, which is too deep for humans to hear, but the 'lonely' whale communicates at 52 hertz.

"NBC is now looking into claims made by Brian Williams that he met Pope John Paul II while in college and was in Germany for the historic fall of the Berlin Wall. Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor who was present the night the Berlin Wall fell, but it seems that Williams may have claimed he too was there, while working with WCBS-TV. 'I've been so fortunate,' said Williams in a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library according to CNN. 'I was at the Brandenburg Gate the night the wall came down.' And while Williams did witness some of the wall's removal, an NBC source said as a matter of fact; 'Brian arrived the day after the wall came down.' Scroll down for videos . NBC is now looking into claims made by Brian Williams (above) that he met Pope John Paul II while in college and was in Germany for the historic fall of the Berlin Wall . Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor who was present the night the Berlin Wall fell (above) Furthermore, in a 2004 interview, Williams said he 'arrived at the Berlin Wall a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did.' However, at a November 8, 2014 gala he stated; 'Here's a fact: 25 years ago tonight, Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall.' As for his meeting with Pope John Paul II, while Williams did acknowledge the fact the Pope vicited Catholic College while he attended, it wasn't until 2004 that he suddenly said during a commencement speech at the same university that he met he man, and shook his hand. Following his death however, Williams said; 'I was a student at Catholic University, and over the course of two hours, chatted up a Secret Service agent who spilled like a cup of coffee and told me that the pope would be coming our way, straight up the steps of a side door at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. I positioned myself and held out my hand and said, ""Welcome to Catholic University, Holy Father."" And he embraced my hand with both of his, made the sign of the cross, and said a blessing to me.' This as claims he was friendly with the SEAL team responsible for killing Osama Bin Laden during his time in Iraq have been called into question. The embattled broadcaster claims he received a soldier's knife as a gift and was given a piece of the helicopter used in the 2011 operation which led to the former  Al Qaeda leader's death. In interviews he also described flying alongside Navy SEAL Team Six in helicopters a number of times - a tale the U.S. Special Operations Command has disputed because they do not embed journalists with counter-terrorism units. The veteran journalist was also reporting on the conflict from Kuwait at the time he claimed to have arrived in Iraq with the elite team. The new allegations have surfaced just two days after the 55-year-old was suspended by the channel for six months without pay after lying about an RPG attack in Iraq. Shortly after the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks was killed in a secret operation in Pakistan, Williams started talking openly about the unit in interviews claiming he had the 'honor' of flying with them when he first arrived in Baghdad. The embattled broadcaster is seen reporting from Baghdad International Airport. He claimed he arrived three days after the invasion on March 22, 2003. However he was stationed in Kuwait at the time . The Huffington Post reported that during an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman the day after the Bin Laden raid in 2011, Williams said: 'We have some idea which of our special operations teams carried this out. It happens to be a team I flew into Baghdad with, on the condition that I would never speak of what I saw on the aircraft, what aircraft we were on, what we were carrying, or who we were after.' While anchoring NBC's Nightly News the following night he said: 'Now, people might be hearing about SEAL Team 6. I happen to have the great honor of flying into Baghdad with them at the start of the war.' A year later on the chat show he claimed he flew in with the military unit on March 22, 2003, three days after the invasion. However he was in Kuwait for the initial stages of the invasion and did not report from inside Iraq until April 9 - where he used a flashlight to speak to the camera. In another Late Show appearance in 2012, Williams told a soldier he admired his knife while they chatted over a box of Wheat Thins. He then told the host: 'Darned if that knife didn't show up at my office a couple weeks later.' It is allegedly one of the many memorabilia items Williams has been handed over the years - including signed sports memorabilia, autographs and a B-24 control panel from an American Second World War aircraft that was recovered in a field in Great Britain . Eight years after he was gifted the weapon he described how he received an un-signed thank you note with a package containing a piece of fuselage. He claims it was from the helicopter used in the raid on Osama Bin Laden's Pakistan compound. The aircraft was blown up by the commandos after the raid, fearing it contained sensitive material that could have got into enemy hands and used against the United States. In the months after the raid, John Kerry managed to secure a deal with Pakistan that saw some of the tail from the aircraft returned. Replacement: On Wednesday night, Williams' name was taken off the Nightly News' graphics and the program's title was officially changed . United States Special Operations Command spokesman Ken McGraw told The Post Williams could only have received a piece of the helicopter after parts of it had been given back. He added: 'We do not embed journalists with this or any other unit that conducts counter-terrorism missions.' On Tuesday Williams was suspended for six months without pay after he admitted to lying about his time in Iraq. In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, described his puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'. Bosses at the network finally acted after deciding Williams's own decision last week to remove himself from anchoring for 'several days' was not enough. He claimed to have been insidean aircraft when it was hit by an RPG - he was actually around one mile away. On Wednesday, the network changed the name of the broadcast from NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams to NBC Nightly News. Acknowledging that it was 'an enormously difficult story' to report, the show aired a segment about Williams' six-month suspension and pledged to make itself worthy of viewers' trust. Replacement anchor Holt opened the report by saying: 'And now to the story many of you are talking about tonight and one that for us not only hits close to home but in our home.' Holt quoted from statements from Turness and Burke, in which they described Williams' actions as 'wrong and completely inappropriate,' and which jeopardized 'the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News.' Holt then added: 'Now if I may on a personal note say it is an enormously difficult story to report. 'Brian is a member of our family, but so are you, our viewers and we will work every night to be worthy of your trust.' Daily Mail Online has contacted NBC and the Special Operations Command for comment. Scandal: The newest allegations are concerning for Williams (pictured arriving for his appearance on Letterman's show in 2013) who is already facing an investigation by NBC News . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","NBC is looking into claims Brian Williams made in the past about being at the Berlin Wall the night it fell and meeting Pope John Paul II .

"The messy row between the boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown and her family continues, amid claims Nick Gordon has not made any attempt to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend in hospital, where she is fighting for her life in a coma. According to TMZ, Gordon, 25 - who claims he has been barred from seeing Bobbi Kristina and has hired a lawyer - has avoided Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where the daughter of Whitney Houston has been on life support since January 31. Gordon was in their Roswell home when a friend, Maxwell Lomas, 24, found Bobbi Kristina face-down in the bathtub unresponsive. Gordon allegedly staged an appearance 'for the cameras' outside the hospital after Bobbi Kristina was admitted, but never actually went inside, the website reported. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sole sighting: Nick Gordon was only seen visiting Bobbi Houston's hospital once, one the day after she was found drowned. New claims say he staged the visit 'for the cameras' and did not actually go inside . Messy: It was also revealed that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found . Cissy Houston (left) and Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown (right), are pictured at the hospital on Thursday . Pat Houston at the Emory University Hospital on Friday where Bobbi Kristina Brown remains . Gordon has been in hiding since the photos were taken. And on Friday, he released a statement requesting that the media 'cease speaking with unauthorized members of the family.' Detectives have launched an investigation into how Bobbi Kristina was found with injuries on her chest, as well as additional bruises on her mouth and face. Gordon has insisted it was wrong to blame him for the heiress's condition and that he desperately wanted to be allowed to see her. He told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby.' 'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know. 'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.' Gordon claims to have opened up discussions with Bobbi's family to try to persuade them to allow him to see his girlfriend, who has previously described him as her husband, although any marriage has been denied by her family. There has only been one public visit to her bedside by Gordon, one the day after she was found drowned at the home they shared. Supportive: Detectives have launched an investigation into how Bobbi Kristina was found with injuries on her chest. Above, Bobbi's uncle, Gary Houston, is pictured arriving at Emory Hospital in Atlanta on Friday . Uncle: Gary Houston, who was accompanied at the hospital by his wife, Pat, is late singer Whitney's brother .

Pat Houston looks toward the camera in a pair of black sunglasses as she visits her critically ill niece . Couple: Gary (left) and Pat Houston (right) are pictured outside Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday . Since then he has not been seen at the hospital where she is being treated, although her father Bobby Brown, grandmother Cissy Houston and other relatives, such as her aunt and uncle Gary and Pat Houston, have been seen arriving or leaving the hospital virtually every day. The source said: 'He is frustrated, missing her and has had to sit back and feels helpless about everything. He just wants to be with her.' Bobbi's cousin Jered Brown claimed Gordon was taking legal action to force the hands of her family to allow him to visit the young woman who has been in a medically induced coma since being found unresponsive at her Atlanta home. But Gordon denied any legal moves last night and was said to be in 'constant prayer' for her recovery. His attorneys Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy released a statement which said: 'In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not. Ms Brown, 21, has been in a coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since January 31, when she was found face down in a bathtub . Lost control of car: Bobbi Kristina Brown was driving a Jeep Liberty on January 27 when she lost control, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another vehicle. She was found unresponsive on January 31. The 21-year-old is seen here in an undated selfie . 'Mr Gordon's only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina . 'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon. Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.' Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. Last year, Bobbi Kristina's maternal aunt Marion Houston sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April. Jered Brown said he had been helping Gordon, who was one of two people who found her in the bathtub, by acting as a liason between him and Bobbi's family. 'We sit down and talk about things he wants my family to know and what we would love for Krissy to know, and that is that he loves her and is just waiting for her to wake up,' he told the station 11Alive . 'To be honest with you, Nick is feeling very emotional right now behind all of this. He's pretty torn about about what's going on.' He said Bobbi still needed ' a miracle' to survive and urged people to continue praying for her. She had been troubled in the days before she was taken to hospital. Four days befoe she was driving and lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty, crashing into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and transported to a hospital, according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Police had also been called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there, but officers found no evidence of an altercation, said Roswell police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Scene: Gordon and a friend discovered Bobbi Kristina in the bathtub at their home in the neighborhood of Roswell, Georgia, pictured, on January 31. She has been in a medically-induced coma ever since . Speaking out: Speaking to Fox News, Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina's aunt, has said she believes the young woman's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, should be charged in relation to her injuries . Whitney Houston was was found in a bathtub at a hotel near Los Angeles on February 11, 2012, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. The inquest ruled Houston's death was an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Bobbi was her only child, although Gordon had been 'adopted' by the singer at the age of 12. It is claimed Bobbi stands to inherit her mother's fortune of around $12 million when she reaches the age of 30.","Nick Gordon has avoided Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, family claim .

"A bigamist married his second wife on the same beach in Mexico where he honeymooned with the first - who only found out about his latest wedding when she went on Facebook. Adrian Linham, 43, secretly dated Hayley Totterdell for three years while his loyal wife of seven years Liz, 37, thought their marriage was running smoothly. He spent a lot of time away from the couple's marital home near Bristol saying he was working in Bangor, north Wales for his job as a scuba diving instructor. But was actually splitting his time and living just 16 miles away with Hayley - who he then married in Riviera Maya, the same place he had honeymooned with his first wife. Hayley's family and friends were all blissfully unaware he was already married. Liz knew nothing about the ceremony until she received a letter from her mother-in-law saying she was sorry to see they had divorced and Adrian had remarried. Scroll down for video . Adrian Linham married wife Liz in Weston-Super-Mare in 2007 before the couple honeymooned in Mexico . But after several years of marriage, Linham met Hayley Totterdell, who he then married at the same resort he had visited with his previous wife six years earlier . Liz then went online and found dozens of pictures of her grinning husband embracing his new bride - on the same beach where they went on honeymoon. Scuba diving instructor Linham even had the same best man at both weddings. Linham has now been jailed for 18 weeks for bigamy - but new wife Hayley is sticking by her husband. Linham has two children from a previous partner and one with Liz, while Hayley has two children from a previous husband. Mother-of-one Liz said: 'I didn't think stuff like this happened in real life and I certainly didn't think it would ever happen to me. 'I genuinely didn't know what was going on. I never thought for a moment that he'd gone and married someone else. Liz has spoken of the extent of Linham's lies after he was jailed for bigamy this week . 'It has completely altered the way I look at everyone. I look at people now, who I have known and trusted for years, and think 'can I really trust you'?.' Liz and Adrian met at his brother's wedding in 2000 and became an item in July 2006 after he divorced his first wife. They got engaged in 2007 and married just months later at Rookery Manor in Somerset before jetting off to Riviera Maya in Mexico for their honeymoon. But throughout their relationship, Linham would stay at their marital home near Bristol less and less - sometimes coming home as little as once or twice a month. In spite of this Liz thought their marriage was still going strong and she gave up work to look after their daughter, now aged four. 'He would tell me he loved me every day and he'd say how he couldn't be without me,' she said. But she was shocked to discover that he had been leading a double life and had been seeing Hayley Totterdell for more than three years. Liz was aware of Hayley's existence but had been told she was merely the wife of Linham's psychiatrist. Hayley was blissfully unaware that Adrian was already married and only found out about his previous marriage when he was arrested. They are believed to have got engaged in August 2012 after he proposed on the same beach where he honeymooned with Liz. Then, in May 2014, Linham told Liz he was going away for a longer stretch in Bangor to oversee exams - but actually flew back to Mexico for his wedding to Hayley. None of Hayley's family knew he was already married and he is believed to have told best man Mark Stapleton that he had already divorced Liz. After the wedding Adrian returned to the UK and carried on living his double life as if nothing had changed. Liz only found out about the wedding three months later when she received a letter from Adrian's mum, who she had not spoken to for a while. 'I got a letter from his mum on 21 August 2014,' she said. 'It said that she was sorry to hear Adrian and I had gotten divorced and that she hoped I was dealing with it ok.' She then went on to say that she had been on Facebook and seen Linham's wedding pictures to Hayley and hoped that his new marriage hadn't affected me too much.' Linham is believed to have got engaged to Hayley in 2014, when he proposed on the same beach he and Liz had visited shortly after they were married in 2007 . Neither his not Hayley's family were aware of his secret wife at the ceremony at the same resort later that year . She added: 'It was such a huge shock to me, I went on to Facebook and found the pictures pretty much straight away. 'I didn't read the whole letter - I tore it up into tiny pieces and threw it away, I had just picked out certain parts of the letter. 'Those parts of the letter are still whirling around in my head, especially the bit about 'Mrs Hayley Linham' - she took his name.' Liz added: 'I called him to confront him but he yet again denied it - I just went into meltdown. 'He totally denied it and told me not to be so silly. But that was it - I haven't spoken to him since. 'It's just been like a total nightmare. I actually remember saying this is the kind of thing you'd read about in the newspapers and magazines.' Liz has since discovered the catalogue of lies which Adrian told her in order to conduct his secret double life. She recalled how she waited at home all day one Christmas Day for Adrian to return home only for him to arrive late in the evening. Linham told his wife he was away for work but was secreting living at his bride-to-be Hayley's house (pictured) - which is on the other side of Bristol from his marital home with Liz . It later transpired he had spent the day with Hayley before telling her his mum had died in order to duck out and return to his wife. He then returned home to Hayley, describing his mother's funeral in full detail - despite the fact she is still alive. In December 2013 Liz suffered a miscarriage at 7pm one evening but Adrian left her by 7am the next morning to go and see Hayley. The love rat also tricked Liz into redecorating Hayley's second home in Swanage, Dorset - asking her to paint the bedroom, and her children's bedrooms, convincing her it was his boss' home. Liz said: 'I'd always known about Hayley but the way he'd speak of her was just ""oh she's loaded, her and her husband have got more money than sense so I do as many jobs as possible at their house to rinse them"". 'He even took me to Hayley's second home in Swanage on two separate occasions, the first time I actually helped him set up for a party he was throwing for her and the second time I helped him redecorate. 'I painted her bedroom and both of her children's bedrooms as he told me it was his bosses house and we could stay there if we painted.' Liz had no idea her husband was seeing another woman and believed their marriage was still going strong . Linham had the same best man, Mark Stapleton, at both weddings, but Mr Stapleton is believed to have been completely unaware he had not divorced Liz . Liz was so furious she reported his actions to the police and he pleaded guilty to one count of bigamy at North Somerset Courthouse in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, yesterday. Chair of the bench, Peter Searle, sentenced Linham to 17 weeks in prison and ordered him to pay £1,000 compensation and put into place a restraining order. He told Linham, who has two children from a previous relationship: 'The length of deception is nothing short of incredible. You have shown no remorse and have humiliated your wife.' Sue Baker, defending, told the court he admitted bigamy when he was arrested and intended to get divorced from his first wife when he returned from the wedding 'but he was putting the cart before the horse'. Linham has now begun divorce proceedings, the court heard.","Two-timing husband lived double life with wife and girlfriend of three years .

"Taylor McDonnell, pictured outside court, has been cleared of killing Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86 . A young hairdresser who mowed down and killed an elderly couple while on her iPhone at the wheel has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving. Taylor McDonnell, 21, was on her way to see her boyfriend when she knocked over and killed Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, on a poorly-lit road near their home in Ponthir, South Wales. Now the devastated family of the elderly couple claim 'justice has not been done' after McDonnell was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving while on her iPhone. The prosecution had alleged that Ms McDonnell had been distracted by her phone but she told the jury at Newport Crown Court that she began her call in a lay-by and switched to hands-free mode. She broke down as she told the jury that she only saw 'a flash of colour' before hitting the couple, who were walking arm in arm through through the village on their evening stroll. Her trial also heard evidence from road crash expert David Loat, who said that the collision was unavoidable because Mr and Mrs Drew were obscured by a passing car as they crossed the road. Mr Loat, a former Avon and Somerset Constabulary officer, said: 'It is possible that both views [of Ms McDonnell and the Drews] were obstructed by that car. 'You would have got glare from the headlights... anything behind an approaching vehicle becomes very difficult to see.' Newport Crown Court has been told that McDonnell spent 18 minutes of her 20 minute drive making a series of phone calls. But the hairdresser, who was wearing slippers at the time of the accident, denied making three telephone calls while driving. McDonnell told the court: 'I was driving and I remember seeing on my driver's side the colour of something. 'Before I could get my mind to function something hit my windscreen and I slammed on my brakes. Joyce (left) and Denis Drew (right) had been married for 54 years when they went for an evening stroll in November 2013 and were mowed down by McDonnell in her car . 'I remember getting out of the car and grabbing my iPhone and asked my Bampi [grandfather] to help me. At first I thought it was an animal because you don't expect it to be a human.' McDonnell said there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision after the elderly couple 'came out of nowhere'. She said: 'I was driving at 30mph and I was looking straight ahead of me. I was driving carefully and responsibly. It was no different to listening to the radio or chatting to a passenger.' McDonnell said she put her grandfather on speaker phone after talking to him for around eight minutes while pulled over and was still listening to him when the crash occurred. But  McDonnell could not explain how cell site analysis of her phone showed it moving while engaged in a six minute phone call with her father at the start of her journey. She also could not account for how she received a text message from her boyfriend in the village where she struck the couple when she had told police she would have been pulled over miles further back while stationary and speaking on the phone to her grandmother when it arrived. McDonnell was accused of being distracted whilst using her iPhone behind the wheel, but she claimed that she had started her call while stationary and switched to hands-free mode before driving . McDonnell said there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision after the elderly couple 'came out of nowhere' Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said: 'She was grossly distracted by her telephone. 'She wasn't paying proper attention to her driving - which ultimately caused the deaths of two elderly people - because a telephone call was far more important.' Retired RAF airman Denis and teacher Joyce met on a blind date and were married for 54 years before the tragedy on November 13, 2013. Mrs Drew died of her 'massive injuries' in the Royal Gwent Hospital just a few hours after the collision. Mr Drew was too weak to undergo surgery to treat the multiple fractures, lacerations and deep bruising he suffered, and he died in the same hospital six days later. McDonnell broke down as the verdict was read in court today, however, the family of the Drews say they are 'devastated' with the not guilty verdict and are calling on drivers to not drive and use their phones . McDonnell, of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving and a lesser charge of causing death by careless driving, after a jury took eight hours of deliberation. She broke down in tears as the verdict came in and later refused to speak to reporters as she walked free from court and tried to hide her face from photographers as she left. The Drews daughter, Sarah England, said her family was 'shocked' and devastated by the not guilty verdict. Speaking on the steps of Newport Crown Court, she said: 'We are utterly devastated. We are shocked by the not guilty verdict. 'For our beloved parents we feel that justice has not been done. We will never come to terms as to why these gentle souls lost their lives in such a brutal and violent way. The crash happened on a quiet 30mph road in the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales (pictured) A tearful Mrs England, who was flanked by sister Helen Adam, added that her family wanted the use of mobile phones when driving, even on hands-free, to be as unacceptable as drink-driving. 'The only possible good that comes come out of this is to change the universal acceptance of the use of mobile phones while driving. 'We would like public opinion to think of this in the same way as drink driving. Mobile phones - whether hands free or not - means that people are not in control of the car. 'Sanctions should be considerably higher and more strictly enforced. For our family this is a wholly unacceptable outcome.'","Taylor McDonnell was on her way to see her boyfriend and on her iPhone .

"After spending 47 years chasing criminals across London, Britain's longest serving policeman has hung up his helmet. PC Robert Brown joined the Metropolitan Police at the age of 19 in 1968, when officers relished in their £855 annual salaries and marvelled at the recent technological development of personal radios. Some five decades later and having been involved in some of the city's most notorious crimes, the 64-year-old has retired. At a moving ceremony in Croydon today PC Brown shook the hand of more than 100 officers who had turned out to bid him farewell. He arrived at the honour guard in a vintage Morris panda car - used by officers in 1968 - and accompanied by two of the Met's white Sovereign Escort horses. Scroll down for video . PC Robert Brown, Britain's longest serving policeman has retired after 47 years. The 64-year-old was celebrated at a horse guard ceremony in Croydon, south London today (left). He joined the force in 1968 shortly after his 19th birthday as a trainee cadet (right) Asked what advice he would give today's force, he smiled: 'It's all about people, about their problems, and you try and just help them the best you can.' Born in Croydon in 1950, PC Brown was among the first batch of officers to operate under the New Theft Act, still in use today. He spent 13 weeks at the Met's training centre in Hendon before serving at stations in Brent, Norbury, Addington an Sutton. In the late 1990s, he joined the Croydon branch, where he carried out his last day's work to rapturous applause today. Speaking of his commitment to the job, Mr Brown said humbly: 'I always wanted to do something like public service, looking after people. 'And that is what it basically is. Sometimes it's arresting them but other times it's protecting people, looking after them, and that is what I wanted to do. I have been quite content to do that.' Reminiscing about his first few years in service, Mr Brown spoke of how much the strains of his job had changed. 'It was quieter. We didn't always have radios, no panda cars - it was more or less coming on from Dixon Of Dock Green, where you had a whistle, a truncheon, a police box to go into to make calls to the station to say you were safe and pick up your calls from. 'If it was an emergency call they used to flash the light on top to get people to go to the box to answer it - that's what it was all about. 'It was a quieter pace of life. You went out and had a particular beat to do. It actually was checking shop doorways and shops to see they were locked and things like that - that's what you did.' Mr Brown was driven to the ceremony today in a vintage Morris panda car (above) like those used when he first joined the force in 1968 . Mr Brown shook the hand of every police officer who turned out to celebrate him today, greeting more than 100 people in the street . Metropolitan Police officers lined the streets outside Croydon Station to wave PC Brown off this afternoon in a touching ceremony . When PC Brown signed up to join the Metropolitan Police in 1986 as a cadet trainee, a typical salary for an officer of his age was £855 a year. While women had been accepted to the force they earned significantly less at £775, working fewer hours than their male peers. The first black female police officer joined in the year Mr Brown signed up. Her name was Sislin Fay Allen. In 1968, John Waldron was at the helm of the force as commissioner. Many expected his role to be temporary following the sudden death of his predecessor Joseph Simpson. Waldron in fact served until 1972. Most significantly around the year in which Mr Brown joined the force, say historians, is the introduction of new technology. 'Personal radios had just been introduced which is the biggest, most remarkable thing,' Neil Paterson, Manager at the Metropolitan Police Heritage Centre said. 'Of course there was the introduction of the New Theft Act which we still use today.' Another crucial change in the law was implemented in the case of Fagan vs Metropolitan Police. The trial brought about the introduction of mens rea, latin for 'guilty mind', which denotes a defendant's deliberate intention to cause harm. Sislin Fay Allen was the first black female to join the force in 1968 (left). At the time, John Waldron (right) was serving as commissioner . PC Brown joined the force at the time of Dixon of Dock Green, the 1960s programme depicting life as a London police officer and starring (from left to right) Arthur Rigby, Jack Warner, Peter Byrne and Geoffrey Adams . An officer on point duty stops traffic to help a woman pushing a pram cross the road in central London . Five years after signing up he was involved in the high profile shooting of Jewish businessman and Marks & Spencer boss Joseph Sieff who was killed by Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal. In 1978 he worked alongside a special branch during the arrest of Astrod Proll,  a member of revolutionary terrorists the Baader-Meinhof gang, or the Red Army Faction. PC Brown was also on duty during the first Brixton riot in 1981, facing bricks, bottles and burning buildings. Aside from a few short breaks he worked for three whole days as he and his fellow officers struggled to keep order. Perhaps the darkest day of his time in uniform came on February 8 1994, when he and three colleagues responded to an armed robbery at a sub-post office in New Addington. One of them, Sergeant Derek Robertson, was stabbed. PC Brown gave him first aid and watched on desperately as medics tried to save his life to no avail. Of how much the profession has changed since then he added: 'It has had to evolve because society has changed, hasn't it. ""There's a certain amount of more violence. I think police officers need to be protected more and they are protected more, and the equipment's better than it used to be. 'When I stopped working on the streets I was wearing body armour, I was carrying an asp, I had CS gas and everything else, and that's just been brought about because of the amount of violence we are having to face sometimes. 'It is time to go. My job has run it's course and it's time to go to on to pastures new. I didn't want to stay on any longer and I think I've done what I wanted to do. It's time to do something different.' Asked what advice he would pass on to the younger generation of officers, Mr Brown said: 'Listen to people, go with the training, don't always assume that something facing you is the whole story, and ask people what's really going on before you make any decisions. 'And just be patient - you have got to have a lot patience, because you are called names, and the names don't really mean anything. The veteran policeman was accompanied by two of the Met's white Sovereign Horses as he drove towards Croydon Police station today . Throughout his 47-year career the officer has been involved in the arrests of high profile murderers and policing of riots . 'It's all about people, about their problems, and you try and just help them the best you can. That's what I've tried to do all my service, and try and remain cheerful and polite.' Last week the 64-year-old was awarded the Queen's Police Medal at Buckingham Palace, one of the highest honours an officer can achieve. At the ceremony in Croydon today, Chief Superintendent Andy Tarrant, Croydon's borough commander, said: 'For me Bob is the epitome of a good police officer, someone who wanted to serve as long as possible on the front line, and he is an ideal role model to younger serving officers. 'I spoke to an officer recently with 30 years service who dealt with an incident with Bob over the last couple of weeks, and they said they learned something from how Bob dealt with it. 'The fact that Bob could show a really experienced officer how something could be dealt with really pays testament to him. 'We are very proud and we will be sorry to see him go, and I think this police station will be a sadder place because he is retiring.' Mr Brown now plans to spend more time with family in Yorkshire. Tragically his wife Renee died last year, followed by his son, Lee, who died of pneumonia last month. Today his sister and nephew were among those lauding him as a credit to the police force. '(The ceremony) is nothing more than he deserves. He wouldn't have wanted all this but it is just amazing. We are immensely proud of him,' said Robert Brown. Mrs Brown added: 'I can't find the words, really. Our mother was so proud, and had photos of him on the wall and used to tell people, ""that's my Bobby up there.""'","PC Robert Brown has retired from the Metropolitan Police after more than 47 years in service across London .

"The teenagers who were sexually assaulted by former New York Yankee Chad Curtis have filed a complaint  alleging members of the school board were 'devoted to him'  even after his sex conviction. Curtis, 46, is currently serving seven to 15 years in prison after a Michigan jury convicted him of criminal sexual misconduct in 2013 while he was a coach at Lakewood High School. He  sexually assaulted three young girls - two of whom were only 15 at the time  - in the weight room of a high school where he was a volunteer coach. According to the teenagers who have filed the complaint with the U.S. Department of Education members of the school board acted improperly and sent him jail house prayers. Abuse: Chad Curtis, is currently serving seven to 15 years in prison after a Michigan jury convicted him of criminal sexual misconduct in 2013 while he was a coach at Lakewood High School . Forgiveness: In a shocking jail house interview in 2014, from Harrison Correctional Facility in Michigan, the staunch Christian repeated his claims that his victims made the allegations up . Four students have filed a federal lawsuit against Curtis and the school district. Evidence uncovered during that process included text messages and emails that are part of the complaint. According to NBC, the complaint highlights the fact that school board member Brian Potter wrote to Curtis after the first molestation charge was made in 2012. Potter wrote to the ex-outfielder: 'Some words of encouragement that have been running through my mind. 'You have lived and continue to live a righteousness life that no on[e], or no word can take away. Nothing can separate you from our father. Praise God.' During his glittering decade-long career, Curtis received acclaim for hitting a walk-off home run during Game 3 of the 1999 World Series. He also played for a half-dozen teams but has maintained he is innocent and that the girls lied about being groped and violated during secret sports massage sessions. Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32. He was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration. In a shocking jail house interview in 2014 from Harrison Correctional Facility in Michigan, the staunch Christian repeated his claims that his victims made the allegations up. Describing one of his victims, then a 15-year-old sophomore, he declared: 'She'll wake up, throw up her hands and just say, 'I can't do it anymore. And when that happens, I have every intention of forgiving her.' Career: During his glittering decade-long career, he received acclaim for hitting a walk-off home run during Game 3 of the 1999 World Series . Support: Curtis hugged his wife center, and children after the verdict was read out during his trial . But his victims said members of the school board including Potter and fellow board member Gary Foltz also supported him with post-conviction character references. In addition, they acted as members of his 'prayer team.' The victims' lawyer, Douglas Fierberg said that the school board's support for Curtis occurred despite some of his victims being harassed for coming forward about the abuse. This was particularly difficult as two of them still attended Lakewood school. The complaint said Curtis 'was revered at Lakewood both for his celebrity, and for the persona as a 'man of faith' he perpetuated at the school, and at a nearby church. 'This blind devotion to Curtis is evident throughout Curtis's tenure at Lakewood, and in all of Lakewood's dealings with Curtis and Curtis's victims.' In addition the victims said that they did not receive any protection after they made the allegations against him. In response to the complaint, Lakewood Superintendent Mike O'Mara said he could not comment because of pending litigation. However, the school's lawyers told NBC that it had no idea Curtis was molesting the students before they came forward and immediately cooperated with police and barred him from school. A spokesman for the Education Department said an assessment of the complaint is ongoing.","Curtis is serving seven to 15 years in prison for criminal sexual misconduct .

"Tragic: Father-of-two Keith Preece, 62, was killed after being kicked in the head by one of his own cows . A farmer has been killed after being kicked in the head by one of his own cows in a freak accident. Father-of-two Keith Preece, 62, was loading cattle on to a trailer on his farm in Shropshire with his wife when the half-tonne animal kicked out and stuck him on top of the neck. Mr Preece was rushed to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital following the accident in Bridgnorth last Wednesday. Despite the efforts of doctors Mr Preece died from his injuries in hospital two days later. Mr Preece, who was described as fit and healthy before the accident, is survived by his wife and daughters, Debbie and Rachel. Yesterday his heartbroken family spoke about the tragedy for the first time. His wife June said in a statement: 'We are all still reeling from the shock of it all.' 'He was a devoted husband and loving father and grandfather.' Richard Yates, chairman of the Shropshire branch of the National Farmers Union, paid an emotional tribute to his friend. He said: 'He always had a smile on his face and was simply one of life's good guys. 'He was a man of the land, a real countryman and worked every day. He was a traditional, hardworking farmer. 'Keith had a great life in front of him to enjoy and never did anyone any harm. 'It shows how unpredictable each day can be and his passing is such a tragedy.' Mr Preece's family also revealed consultants had likened the accident to the sudden death of cricketer Phil Hughes in November last year. Father-of-two Keith Preece was loading cattle on to a trailer on his farm in Shropshire (pictured) with his wife when the half-tonne animal kicked out and stuck him on top of the neck . Hughes, 25, also tragically died two days after being hit on neck by a ball during a domestic match in Sydney. In both cases the blows had struck the points at the base of the skull causing a vertebral artery - one of the main arteries that leads to the brain - to split and bleed into the brain. Doctors say there have only been one hundred cases worldwide of the 'extremely rare' condition known as vertebral artery dissection. An inquest is yet to be opened into Mr Preece's death.

"A northeast Florida high school has barred a student from saying 'God bless America' while delivering morning announcements on campus after complaints from two atheist students. And the decision has seen locals - mostly parents and church-goers - come together in protest. The atheist students at Yulee High in Nassau County took their complaints to the Appignani Humanist Association - a Washington-based firm - before telling the school and the group's lawyers sent a letter threatening the school with a lawsuit. First Coast News reported that the group said it is 'inappropriate and unlawful' for a public school to use God in an official statement. Not happy: Demonstrators form outside Yulee High School on Friday after a student was told he can no longer say 'God Bless America' during his morning announcements . 'We do not have the right to remain silent': The protesters say they are standing up for the student . Yulee High School received a letter from the American Humanist Organization over the phrase 'God Bless America', which a student had been saying each morning . They said that even though they were the words of a student, they were being made on behalf of the school because it was an announcement. In response, the school district said students were free to express their beliefs all day long, but not during school announcements. That caused demonstrators to form outside the school on Friday. They say they want to stand up for the student who was reprimanded, believing he did nothing wrong. 'We want to let him know he should not be ashamed, that he did the right thing,' local Kathy Parker told News4Jax. 'I don't see what this young man has done wrong. 'We need to stand out here and stand up for him. 'I think everyone has the right of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. 'I hope he does it again.' Complaint: This is the first page of the letter the American Humanist Association sent a letter to the school's principal, threatening legal action if the school did not respond within seven days . The principal, Natasha Drake, hit back at reports the school had ok-ed the 'God Bless America' part of his speech. 'The student on his own accord made the statement,' Drake wrote to the Appignani Humanist Association, according to News4Jax. 'I have called the student in this morning and directed him that at no time is he to add or take away from announcements that have been pre-approved and that if he did it again, he would no longer have the privilege of making the morning announcements. 'I am disappointed that the students who filed the complaint did not do so with me first, as I would have addressed it immediately.' A district representative stressed the student at the center of the issue is not in trouble and has not been removed from the announcements - but he was told not to say 'God Bless America.","Demonstrators gathered Friday at Yulee High in Nassau County, Florida .

"The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Footage that shows the moment when scientists discovered the extent of the injuries suffered by the Plantagenet king - who was the last English king to die in battle - has been released. In the video, Professor Guy Rutty, a forensic pathologist at University of Leicester, is shown discovering two wounds at the base of the skull. Scroll down for video . The blow that killed Richard III was so powerful it left damage inside the skull on the opposite side (above) Looking inside the cranium, however, he finds a large indentation that lines up directly with one of the wounds at the base of the skull. The genetic analysis showed that Richard III almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age. Richard III was depicted by William Shakespeare as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the Tower of London. But scans of the king's skeleton show he wasn't a hunchback, but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle. The notorious description by Shakespeare of a ‘hunchback toad’, a Machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body, a limp and withered arm, was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation, experts claim. Instead, a 3D reconstruction of the king’s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of ‘scoliosis’, or sideways bending of his spine to the right. The condition, which would have developed in his early teens, means he was very far from being a hunchback. Despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs, there is no evidence he walked with a limp. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. It comes two months after genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Dr Jo Appleby, who led the exhumation of the skeleton from the Greyfriars car park, said: 'Following the identification of a major sharp force trauma to the base of the skull, which was probably inflicted by a sword or the top spike of a bill or halberd, we were interested to determine the angle of the blow. “Professor Rutty noted a small traumatic lesion on the interior surface of the cranium, directly opposite the sharp force trauma. 'Careful examination showed that the two injuries lined up with one another, and also with an injury to Richard’s first cervical vertebra. 'The combination of all three injuries provided evidence for the direction of the injury and also the depth to which the weapon had penetrated the skull.' Scientists found injuries in the skull of Richard III lined up (above) to reveal  the blow that killed him in battle . Richard III's skeleton found under a car park in Leicester was found to have 11 injuries sustained in battle . According to findings published earlier by the scientists in the Lancet medical journal, the lethal blows came from one of two devastating swipes to the back of the head. One was delivered by a halberd - a vicious axe-like weapon used in the late Medieval period - and the other by a sword. The researchers found that the skeleton had two additional injuries, which they think may have been inflicted after his enemies tore his armour from his lifeless body. One injury - to the buttocks - probably came as his bloodied body was paraded around the battle ground, the researchers suggest. The medical evidence establishes the most detailed account of Richard’s death ever attempted. The scientists used modern forensic methods to examine the injuries inflicted on Richard III's skeleton . Professor Rutty, who led the examination of the remains and has worked as a Home Office pathologist for 19 years, described seeing the injuries in the skull lined up as a 'eureka moment'. He said: 'I was able to look at the large injury in the base of the skull and, through experience, I was able to identify the key injury.' Professor Sarah Hainsworth, a materials engineer at Leicester University also involved in the study, added: 'Using modern forensic examination, we have discovered that Richard's skeleton sustained 11 wounds at or near the time of his death - nine of them to the skull, which were clearly inflicted in battle. 'The injuries to the head suggest he had either removed or lost his helmet. The other two injuries that we found were to a rib and his pelvis.'","Pathologists at Leicester University found injuries on the base of the skull and inside the cranium lined up, suggesting the same weapon made them .

"A jobseeker was shocked after he was branded as 'irritating', 'rude' and 'obnoxious' in a cutting email accidentally sent to him by a prospective employer. James Allen was told he was an 'old, aesthetically challenged guy with no teeth' by the director of a window and conservatory firm, who sent the note after meeting with him about a job opening. In the email, Sarah Haseler, from Right Price PVCu, also claimed Mr Allen was 'one of the most irritating, rude, obnoxious and arrogant people' she had ever had the 'misfortune' to meet. Cutting: The email, pictured, from Sarah Haseler at Right Price PVCu, also claimed Jame Allen was 'one of the most irritating, rude, obnoxious and arrogant people' she had ever had the 'misfortune' to meet . Ms Haseler said the 'therapeutic rant' was sent by mistake and that she had written a second, more professionally-worded one that was intended for Mr Allen. Mr Allen, a former serviceman, met with Ms Haseler for an informal conversation about an opening for a self-employed labourer at the company, based in Plymouth, Devon. He claims he thought their initial meeting had gone well and that Ms Haseler had agreed to get in touch later that day. When he heard nothing back, Mr Allen sent her an email saying: 'Just a quick email to say that you promised to phone me today. 'You did not. I rang your mobile but you did not answer. I sent a text you did not answer. When you promise something you carry it through.' He then received the e-mail, which contained several expletives. Infomal interview: Mr Allen, a former serviceman, met with Ms Haseler for an informal conversation about an opening for a self-employed labourer at the Right Price PVCu, pictured, based in Plymouth, Devon . One line in the message read: 'I only wish I'd have seen your CV beforehand, to save us both the time, as I would have probably noticed your main job role as professional p****.' The 48-year-old, from Princetown, Devon, said his confidence had been knocked by the personal attack. He said: 'There's no way as a professional, and especially as a director of a company, that you would treat somebody that way. I really didn't expect something as nasty as that.' James, . Sincere apologies for not replying to you today, as it happens I actually have a job, and other things to do with my day other than reply to you, when I had already had the misfortune of wasting 30 very long minutes of my life speaking to; not only the most inappropriate person for this job role, but probably for any role, you will spend the next few years applying for, only to get rejected as soon as they meet you. You are without doubt one of the most irritating, rude, obnoxious and arrogant people I have had the misfortune to meet, and your email just solidifies this. Also, for an old aesthetically challenged guy with no teeth you have an unbelievable amount of confidence! So you say, you didn't notice the word 'professional' on our website... belive me, if I had been anything other than 'professional', I would have told you what I was actually thinking which was 'this guy is an absolute ****, get the **** out'. But no, alas, I stayed 'professional'. I only wish I'd have seen your CV beforehand, to save us both the time, as I would have probably noticed your main job role as 'professional p****'. Good luck for the future . Sarah . Ms Haseler admitted she had sent the wrong email, but defended its message, saying she had been left 'genuinely shocked' by Mr Allen's behaviour, claiming he was 'belittling and offensive'. She said: 'Ironically, I had read something that day which said if you are angry or upset you should write it down and get it all out to move on. 'So that evening at home I did this. I then wrote another email reply to James. 'Unfortunately, I now realise that it was in fact the other email which was sent in error, which was never supposed to be seen by him. 'I must stress this was my personal opinion, and not the opinion of the company, and the email written, although sent in error, was in retaliation to a person insulting me.' Ms Haseler claims the meeting with James was not an official interview as they were looking for a self-employed labourer to help carry out basic tasks such as carrying materials and dig holes. She added: 'James was so unbelievably rude, inappropriate and insulting, towards me personally and also the company. 'I actually thought it was a joke. I was waiting for the hidden camera crew to jump out and say ""ha, got ya"". 'I was genuinely shocked, hurt and angered by his behaviour and attitude, and the things he said. 'We have worked very hard to build this family business up and when someone is insulting the business it does feel like they are hurting a member of your family. 'He was derogatory, belittling and offensive and I felt extremely uncomfortable the entire time he was there. When he left I politely said 'Thanks, I'll give you a ring to let you know'. 'That evening, a few hours later on the same day he came in, he sent an email, which was also rude, insulting and harassing. 'James had therefore rejected the self-employed role in this email, so he was not looking for feedback.

"This is the gipsy couple who married ten minutes after a guest was murdered at their wedding. Barney McGinley, 63, was shot in the chest at point-blank range outside the Catholic church in Northern Ireland where Jimmy O'Connor, 16, and Matilda McGinley, 17, were about to marry. Another guest was shot in the arm and a friend slashed with a machete in the  village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh on Wednesday. Police know the identity of the gunman, who is still on the run after fleeing the scene in a car, with sources suggesting the shooting was part of a long-standing feud between rival traveller families. Just married: Jimmy O'Connor, 16, and Matilda McGinley, 17, pictured in the hours after their wedding, where a guest was shot in the car park . The young couple whose wedding day was marred by the brutal attack were encouraged to continue and walked up the aisle around 10 minutes after the murder. Victim: Barney McGinley, 63, was shot in the chest at point-blank range outside the Catholic church in Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh . Mr McGinley was flown to hospital by air ambulance but could not be saved.  The other two men injured in the attack were not seriously injured but required hospital treatment. Parish priest Father Michael King said he married the young couple at the request of the bride's mother after the mayhem outside left  one man dead and two injured. He said women sprinted into the church 'looking for shelter', screaming: 'There are shots, there are shots, there is somebody shooting'. Father King said that the women and he had pleaded with the men to stop fighting in the church car park before the shooting. He said: 'I was shocked by the events, I'm thinking about them ever since. But in another sense I'm not surprised because there is a subtext in traveller's weddings.' 'There is always something very low simmering beneath the surface waiting to explode and it exploded and the circumstances were tragic.' He added: 'Couples are getting married under 18, this lad was just over 16 and the girl was just over 17. 'The reason they come this way to Northern Ireland, because this bride was from Dublin and the groom was from the Midlands... the reason they came here to get married is because you can get marrie under 18 in Northern Ireland. 'In the south of Ireland you need to be 18, so that's why so many of them come up here'. Dramatic day: The bride and members of the wedding party leave St Mary's Catholic Church in the rural village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, after the service . Police at the scene: The priest said there had been an 'altercation' in the car park before the bride arrived . Carry on: Father Michael King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned . Tributes have today poured in for the murdered man. Cousin Willie McGinley wrote on Facebook: 'R.I.P Uncle Barney. Gone but will never be forgotten. Still can't believe he's gone. God only takes the best.' Eileen Connors posted: 'Rest in peace Barney. May God welcome you into his kingdom where you'll have peace and happiness.' Michaela Dinnegan added: 'R.I.P Barney. May you get the best bed in heaven and look over all your family and help them get through this hard time.' The new couple were also praised online, with one saying of Matilda McGinley: 'I’ve seen brides but I have to give it to her she was the nicest bride'. Another said she looked beautiful. Probe: Forensics officers searched for clues around the grounds of St Mary's Catholic Church . Sinn Féin councillor Thomas O'Reilly told the Irish Daily Mail that there were rumours in the town that a 'jealous lover' turned up at the church but he ended up missing his intended target and shooting two other men instead. He added: 'Everyone in the community is shocked. My condolences to the dead man's family and all injured but this happened next door to a primary school, this is of huge concern. 'People are arriving home from work this evening and no-one can believe what has happened. Apparently the bride was still in the church when the shooting took place,' added Mr O'Reilly. Assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Tom Elliott said the attack was 'horrific'. 'It is very worrying that certain people have access to firearms and are willing to use them for any reason,' he said. 'There is a significant onus on police to ensure that these criminals are caught and that the courts ensure they are locked up for a long period.' Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Detective Chief Inspector Una Jennings, who is leading the murder investigation, urged those responsible to hand themselves in. 'What should have been a day of joy and celebration has been turned in to one of heartbreak and tragedy,' she said. 'We are following a number of very definite lines of inquiry in this investigation, thanks to accounts of events outside the church before the wedding ceremony given to us by other guests. 'We know who they are. It would be better for all concerned if they made themselves available to police as soon as possible so that we can build a complete picture of what happened yesterday and the background to those tragic events.'","Jimmy O'Connor, 16, and Matilda McGinley, 17, married after shooting .

"The grandfather of Alecia Pennington — the 19-year-old girl who 'doesn't exist' — has told Daily Mail Online how he dramatically rescued her from the clutches of her fundamentalist Christian parents. It happened on a regular Wednesday visit for Jim Southworth to see his daughter's family, he said in an exclusive interview at his home in Georgetown, Texas. But since that day in September last year, Jim and his wife — also called Alecia — have had no contact with their daughter and her family. 'How could I not have done it?' Southworth asked. 'She is my granddaughter.' Scroll down for video . Alecia Pennington (above) claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school, taught instead by her mother . The 19-year-old is therefore unable to show proof of her identity, and cannot get a birth certificate . James Pennington (pictured left) responded to his 19-year-old daughter Alecia's claims that she has no proof that she is an American citizen by saying in a YouTube clip that he would help her obtain necessary documents. Her grandfather Jim Southworth said she was doing well in her new life . Alecia has gone public with her story this week, saying she can't get a job, board a plane, get a driver's license, vote or do any number of everyday tasks that the rest of America takes for granted, because there is no public record of her existence. She was born at home in Texas and her birth was never registered. She was home-schooled and has never required hospital treatment, her grandfather confirmed. After a week-long standoff with her parents, her father, accountant James Pennington, has now agreed to try to help her get proper documentation to prove that she is who she says she is, Alecia revealed on Friday on her Facebook page. Jim Southworth, 71, said his granddaughter had texted him before he and his wife went to visit his daughter Lisa Pennington, her husband and their nine children in Kerrville, Texas last year. 'She said she was coming home with us. I texted her back saying she had to speak to her mother about that,' he said. After the day-long visit on September 24, Southworth found Alecia — the fourth of the Penningtons' nine children — in his car with her belongings. 'I told her she had to get out,' he said. 'She was 18 at the time and an adult, but I didn't want to be accused of kidnapping. 'But she was adamant and said she wanted to leave with us. I said we should pray on it overnight, but she insisted she wouldn't get out. I told her she had to speak to her mother and my wife and I got out the car so they could talk it over.' But Lisa Pennington failed to persuade her daughter to stay, said Southworth, and she remained in the car. 'Eventually I told my son-in-law I had to take her, she is my grandchild and that is what she wanted. He said, 'Fine, but you are not welcome back here again.' 'Since that day I have not spoken to my daughter or to my other grandchildren.' However, he said Alecia has kept in contact with her siblings with regular phone calls. Southworth said Alecia is doing fine in her new life and is helping a local family as a nanny until she can get proper documentation so she can get a real job. Alecia's mother Lisa (left with Alecia and her three sisters) claims her daughter is misleading people . He said that even before the day she left he could sense friction between Alecia and her parents — whom he described as 'living off the grid.' Alecia's story has gripped the public's imagination since she revealed her plight on Facebook and YouTube, using the handle 'Help Me Prove It.' On YouTube  the teenager faces the camera and says calmly: 'My name is Alecia Faith Pennington and I am a U.S. citizen by birth. 'However, I was born at home,' she continues. 'And my parents neglected to file a birth certificate or birth record of any kind. They also never got me a Social Security number. 'I was home-schooled my entire life so I have no school records. I have also never been to the hospital so I have no medical records. This leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship. 'I am now 19 years old and I am unable to get a driver's licence, get a job, go to college, get on a plane, get a bank account or vote.' She said she has contacted authorities who have no record of her birth and a judge in the county she was born had refused to issue a delayed birth certificate because she had insufficient proof of her identity. 'But that's all the proof I have,' said Alecia. 'I didn't pick this situation for myself, I just have to deal with the consequences and I don't know how to fix it — I don't know how to get out of this. 'I want to travel, I want to get an education, I want to just be a functioning American,' she adds in the 92-second video, which her grandfather said he did not know she was making. 'But I can't until I can prove citizenship. Her mother Lisa, 49, runs a blog called The Pennington Point. She has posted her own version of Alecia's leaving, but has often removed her stories within minutes. In one post, she said: 'On Wednesday, September 24th my life was changed forever. My 18 year old daughter left home. She gave us no warning, no signs that it was coming. She didn't try to talk to us about it or work with us. She, with the help of my parents, just left. And with her she took pieces of my heart that had been torn to shreds.' In another she said Alecia had been helped by 'a godless woman who has been giving her foolish counsel and encouraging her to deceive and get out.' She added: 'Believe me, James and I are all too aware that we are not innocent in this. We played a part in this problem. 'We made mistakes and we have apologized to her, genuinely repented and are asking the Holy Spirit to guide us through this. It feels impossible to think rationally so we have sought counsel from men who give us Scripture to build us up. Alecia is one of nine children (above with their father), and left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side . 'We are taking each step carefully and trying to hold on to the One who knows us better than we know ourselves. I don't want to paint myself as perfect here. I am as imperfect as I can imagine anyone being.' More recently she wrote how she and her family are 'pulling ourselves together' following Alecia's departure. 'We have been making an effort to find our new normal without her. It has been really hard and we all miss her terribly, but I have learned a lot about how to deal with grief. 'I definitely have days when I feel like I can hardly breathe and just cry for no reason. Like, hard crying. I know that's part of the process. Oh, those crazy stages of grief.' On Friday Alecia said on her Facebook page that her father had now said he would help her prove she is who she says she is. 'I have some wonderful news! My father has begun cooperating with us! He states he is willing to sign any documents, and give me any information he has concerning what I may need as proof.' She then asked her followers 'not to post demeaning comments about my parents. Even though I do not agree with them on many things, I would like their reputation to be protected as much as possible.' She also revealed that she has found an attorney who is willing to help her and set out the steps she has already taken to prove her identity. Among the documents she has managed to collect are a statement from a doctor who said he saw her when she was aged 9, a 2005 statement of Baptism from the Fredericksburg Christian Fellowship that does not give a date of birth, and a notarized document concerning the family's change of their last name from Sublett to Pennington from 2014.","Alecia Pennington, 19, claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school, taught instead by her mother .

"A legally blind university student who was sprayed in the face with pepper spray has said that the experience was more terrifying than being in an earthquake. Police used pepper spray on Anna Amelia, 23, and other students when they gained access inside the Sydney Masonic Centre on Friday morning where they began protesting against Education Minister Christopher Pyne. Ms Amelia, who uses a walking stick, said that she remembered 'a bit of push and shove and the next minute it felt like the entire world was on fire, felt like somebody had set fire to my lungs, my eyes were burning'. Scroll down for video . Anna Amelia, 23, (sitting left) said that the experience was more terrifying than being in an earthquake . 'I didn't know what was happening, I didn't know which way was up, down, left or right. It was just pain,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. The 23-year-old said that the incident was more terrifying than her experience during the 2010 Christchurch earthquake, and that the pepper spray had completely obscured her vision. 'I was really scared and disoriented, and almost panicked. I've been through earthquakes and this was far worse than a 7.5 earthquake,' Ms Amelia said. The international relations and development studies student told ambulance officers who attended the scene that she just wanted to leave and get home. Footage of the incident shows students sprawled across the floor as friends comfort them and pour milk into their watering eyes. The student were protesting against university deregulation, one of Pyne's higher education reforms. Mr Pyne was delivering a speech to several education groups inside the building. Students held up signs saying 'You're sPyneless' and 'Education shouldn't be a death sentence,' reports Nine News. Ms Amelia, who is legally blind, said the pepper spray left her completely disoriented . Ms Amelia (left) and fellow student Bridget Holly were treated by NSW Ambulances . While the protest was initially peaceful, things grew heated when students rushed the main entrance where police used the spray. NSW Ambulances treated at least five people at the scene. NSW police would not confirm if pepper spray had been used, and were preparing a statement on the incident. Ridah Hassan, a spokesperson from the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia the students were undeterred by the incident. 'We will be out in full force on March 25 to protest and make sure our voice is heard,' she said. Hassan said police sprayed about a dozen students, including herself, when they entered the building. 'My face is on fire. It's pretty outrageous the lengths the government will go to marginalise the people,' she said. Police hold back protesters inside the Sydney Masonic Centre on Friday morning .

"The partner of an NYPD rookie cop who shot dead an unarmed black man in the stairwell of an apartment block has been given immunity for testifying against his fellow officer. Officer Peter Liang pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to  manslaughter, official misconduct and other charges in the shooting death of 28-year-old Akai Gurley in Brooklyn last November. Liang, 27, was able to be charged so heftily in part because of the grand-jury testimony of his partner, Officer Shaun Landau, police sources to The New York Post. The rookie cop faces more than 15 years in prison if he is found guilty. Scroll down for video . The partner of cop Peter Liang (pictured left arriving in Brooklyn criminal court on Wednesday). has been given immunity for testifying against his colleague in the shooting of Akai Gurley (pictured with his daughter) On November 20, Liang and Landau were patrolling the Louis Pink Houses, a gritty public housing complex in East New York where reports of violent crime had spiked. The hallways were pitch-black, prompting the officers to use flashlights. Liang, for unclear reasons, had his gun drawn and his finger on the trigger. At the same time, Mr Gurley, who has a two-year-old daughter, was waiting for an elevator with a female companion, Melissa Butler. When it didn't come, he stepped into the hallway to take the stairs and was one floor above when he was struck in the chest by a bullet. Police claim that Liang appeared to accidentally fire a shot when he was about 10 feet from the 28-year-old and without a word. After Liang discharged the bullet, he and partner Landau did not respond to radio contact for six and a half minutes, the New York Daily News reported in December. The Liang's arraignment on Wednesday, prosecutors revealed that Landau argued with Liang over what their next steps should be but did not call for back up or an ambulance, according to the Post. Prosecutors alleged that Liang's first concern was that he 'was going to be fired' while Mr Gurley's friend fought alone to keep him alive and was forced to find a neighbor to call 911. Gurley was taken to a nearby hospital where he died. Liang was released without bail on Wednesday. A Brooklyn grand jury heard the case against Liang for just a few days before they decided to issue an indictment on Tuesday. Gurley's girlfriend, Kimberly Michelle Ballinger, who was with him at the time of the shooting, is seen leaving Brooklyn court on Wednesday . The indictment came after mass protests and calls for reform of the grand jury system nationwide following a Staten Island grand jury's refusal to indict a NYPD cop in the chokehold death of Eric Garner and a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown. The November death of Gurley, 28, was ruled a 'homicide' by the Medical Examiner's office - the same verdict was given in father-of-six Eric Garner's death. The New York Police Department assigns rookie officers as reinforcements in parts of the city that have seen increases in crime. The Louis Pink housing project had been the scene of a recent shooting along with robberies and assaults. The NYPD almost immediately declared Mr Gurley's death a 'very unfortunate tragedy' and Commissioner Bill Bratton described the 28-year-old as a 'total innocent'. Police officials pieced together the details of the shooting from radio reports and interviews with Mr Gurley's friend and the second officer. Liang was placed on desk duty after the shooting. Black lives matter: Protestors hold up signs outside the courthouse before the arraignment on Wednesday of NYPD rookie police officer Peter Liang. It was revealed today that his partner is testifying against him .","Officer Peter Liang pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and official misconduct in the shooting death of 28-year-old Akai Gurley .

"Bruce Jenner has reportedly told police there was no way he could have avoided a four-car crash that left one woman dead and seven injured as the driver of the Lexus in front of him slammed on her brakes without warning. Former Olympian Jenner, 65, smashed his Cadillac Escalade into the back of the victim's vehicle on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on Saturday. The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead. Scroll down for video . Bruce Jenner, driving the black Cadillac Escalade has reportedly told police there was no way he could have avoided a four-car crash in Malibu last weekend, which left one woman dead . Bruce Jenner surveys the crash scene and the damage to the cars which were involved in the horrific smash . A white Lexus was pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead . Yesterday it was reported that rather than a chain reaction causing the victim's Lexus to hit a Toyota Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars. But multiple sources have now told TMZ that the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was unable to say if the Lexus had already crashed into the Prius before his car became involved, because it all happened to quickly. The website also reports that law enforcement believes Jenner may have been driving too close to the car in front of him and that drivers are supposed to leave enough space in between the vehicle they are following to prevent such accidents. Police are still investigating the cause of Saturday's crash and it is thought they have not drawn any conclusions yet as to why it may have happened and are probing all possibilities, including that Jenner may have pushed the Lexus into oncoming traffic. Law enforcement sources have also told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving. It has been reported that a chain reaction caused the victim's Lexus to hit a Toyota Prius, pictured in front of her . The woman who died in the four-car crash was 69-year-old widow Kim Howe, a neighbour of the Kardashians . It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius. TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right. Jenner, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. Jenner's Cadillac Escalade hit the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, which then reportedly hit a Prius before being pushed into the path of a Hummer . An aerial view of the crash scene on Saturday shows the damaged cars, and police markings as they work to establish the cause . If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction. Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision. It is illegal to text while driving in California. The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel.

'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'

"A local news reporter who arrived on the scene of drug bust captured a bizarre interview with a bearded, staff-toting man who lives in a school bus nearby. Channel 9 reporter Joleen Chaney was attending the scene where police found 50 marijuana plants in a house when she ran into Sir John Michael, who wears a ponytail held by rubber bands and a bearskin vest. Police were responding to reports of a gunshot when they smelled cannabis in the house of David Mason and arrested him, according to the Oklahoma City outlet. Scroll down for video . Channel 9's Joleen Chaney (left) met a pony-tailed man in a bearskin vest named Sir John Michael (right) when going to the scene of a drug bust at the house of David Mason . However the attention of police and the news reporter was soon diverted by the strange character who lives in the woods. Sir Michael said that there were no gunshots and that the loud noise came from when he 'busted' the window of his big, yellow home with a crowbar after becoming frustrated when working on the vehicle. He said that soon after the noise 'a half a dozen guys with their guns drawn on me' came out of the forest and told him to put down his gun, though he was just twirling his ponytail. The man wears his underpants over women's leggings and carries a long staff with a crystal on the end. He said that he had previously seen police helicopters circling overhead when he was sunbathing nude. Sir Michael said he made a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot when he became frustrated working on his school bus home and 'busted' a window with a crowbar . At one point in Ms Chaney's interview, the man attempts to impart wisdom and says 'If life gives you lemons, f*** life'. It is not known how he first became called Sir John Michael. He said that he lives in the school bus because of a 'long story' that involves his mother and ex-wife. Sir Michael said he was going to bail his landlord David Mason (pictured) out of jail, but a bail bond company ended up putting up the money . Ms Chaney said that Sir Michael was initially skeptical about doing an interview, but was coaxed into it after she said that he would look crazy on TV if he didn't, the reporter told the Rick and Brad Morning Show. Though he supports legalizing marijuana, the local news celebrity is reportedly not involved with growing marijuana on the property. He did, however, say he was going to bail his landlord, Mason, out of jail. The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office confirmed that Mason had been bonded out of jail on Wednesday, the day after his arrest, for $10,000. A company called Any Bondput forward the money.

"Tributes have been pouring in for Steve Strange, the front man of pop band Visage who died of a heart attack aged 55 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh yesterday. But while he is most remembered for his music, the man who helped bring New Romantic style to the world in the 1980s is still having an impact on wardrobes - and make-up bags. From Cara Delevigne's bold eyebrows to Kim Kardashian's love of contouring and Kelis' wacky approach to facial jewellery, Strange has inspired a generation of daring A-list beauty fans. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian is famed for her contouring make-up that accentuates her features giving her more defined cheekbones and a slimmer face, right. But this picture of Steve in 1981, left,  shows how he knew how to use contouring to full effect long before the reality TV star . Model Cara Delevingne, right, has sparked a trend for dark bold eyebrows but Steve was already rocking the look back in 1985, left . Steve, pictured in 2003, often did his own make-up and outrageous looks like this one with heavy eyeliner and blue lipstick have been copied by Lady Gaga, pictured in 2006, right . His more shocking looks are much copied too. Whether Madonna or Lady Gaga, many of the stars who have tried to make headlines with outrageous make-up have been beaten to it by Strange. Strange himself was no stranger to making headlines for his eye-catching looks, whether it was applying lashings of liquid eyeliner and eyeshadow to long false eye lashes. He pulled off contouring with aplomb to accentuate his cheekbones and make his face appear slimmer - a look that is championed by Kim Kardashian today. When she, or one of the other stars to copy Strange, showcase a look, their legions of fans do so as well, with the result that Strange continues to wield enormous amounts of influence on their make-up bags - and by extension ours. Most notable of all is the return of bold power eyebrows, which have been championed by Cara but rocked by the Visage frontman back in the Eighties before the 22-year-old was even born. Princess Julia, who starred in Visage's Fade To Grey video, told Femail: 'Steve Strange's passion for style and self expression is a legacy that helped shape the 80s, 90s 00s to the present day. His imagination and flair for dressing is something that is apparent and continues to inspire... he became an icon and well deserved. 'We met in the late 70s and became firm friends, then and now. Clubs, fashion and music were our playground. He experimented with music, gender and art creating a fantastical vision. 'Permission to parade the most innovative looks our imaginations could conjure up at the New Romantic club The Blitz may be the thing he will be most remembered for... but his imagination didn't stop there, his love of music spurred him on to create Visage initially a studio project with Rusty Egan and Midge Ure which placed him firmly in the limelight as a pioneer of electronic dance. He was the real deal!' A style icon herself, Julia now works as culture correspondent for iD Magazine and writes for Man About Town. Madonna wrapped black lines across her face for her new album cover - was she inspired by Steve who applied make-up for a similar effect in 2013 when he attended an exhibition at the V&A? The Visage frontman wears orange eye shadow in 2002, left, a look Scarlett Johansson used at the Oscars in 2011 . Speaking about his iconic look to BeautyMART last December, he said: 'I have been lucky to work with great make-up artists Richard Sharah who was responsible for David Bowie's looks and did the Fade to Grey video; Phyllis Cohen in the Eighties and now Lara Himpelman. 'In the early Eighties, at the height of the Blitz Kids days, I usually did my own make-up. I've never used a stylist but for shows, shoots and album covers, it's great to collaborate on the make-up. 'Nowadays, I wear less than I used to - it's mainly sculpting using highlighter and bronzer. I useShu Uemura Cleansing Oil, and skincare. If I've had a night out, I use white kohl to brighten things up a bit. I like Naked Cosmetics, eyeshadows, some lashes and pencils.' Speaking of the legacy left by Steve, Terry Barber, director of makeup artistry at M.A.C Cosmetics said: 'Steve Strange epitomised the cult of the New Romantic in the early eighties. 'He was the Post Punk Peacock, a beautiful mix of Geisha, Picasso and Victorian urchin. He crafted the look of the underground scene, a transformation with porcelain skin, graphic lines and carved contours. His videos with Visage are constantly referenced by make-up artists today. A huge loss.' Steve wears an orange wig in his Eighties heyday, left, a hairstyle singer Nicki Minaj has used when performing in 2010 .

"An incredible video has emerged showing the moment an elderly woman bravely confronted two Islamic State militants, telling them their terror group is cursed and that they are not back by God. The video, which is believed to have been shot in Syria, shows the woman walks up to the fighters' car, brand them both 'devils' and tell them: 'I swear nothing you have done was in the way of God'. Clearly shocked at being confronted, the men initially plead with the woman, telling her to explain what she means and asking if 'everything is good between us?'. The woman chooses to ignore the men's attempts to justify ISIS' brutality, however, and instead attacks their bloodthirsty savagery and accuses them of 'killing each other like donkeys'. Scroll down for video . Condemned: The video, which is believed to have been shot in Syria, shows the woman walks up to the fighters' car, brand them both 'devils' and tell them: 'I swear nothing you have done was in the way of God' Becoming increasingly frustrated, the men eventually tell the woman they are busy and order her to go away . The video begins with the elderly woman walking up to the militants car and berate them for being members of the barbaric terrorist organisation. Repeatedly urging them to 'turn back to God' she tells the fighters that ISIS is cursed and that neither they nor Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime will emerge from the bloodshed victorious. The men initially respond to her berating them by asking her what has prompted her attack. They then try to justify their actions by telling her of their recent prayer sessions. The woman, who wears traditional Arabian clothing, ignores the men and continues her attack, swearing at them at insisting that ISIS' brutality is 'making us go backwards'. Becoming increasingly frustrated, the men change their tone and begin telling the woman they are busy and she should go away. They then resort to mockery when she begins reciting verses from the Koran that warn against fighting and slaughter when it is possible to make peace. 'You don't want this slaughtering, nor do you want this murder,' she says, prompting one of the militants to chillingly reply: ' We have come to you with slaughter'. Angry: The video begins with the elderly woman walking up to the militants car and berate them for being members of the barbaric terrorist organisation . Brave: The men initially respond to her berating them by asking her what has prompted her to say ISIS is cursed. They then try to justify their actions by telling her of their recent prayer sessions . ISIS militants (pictured) have brought a regime of brutal rape and torture to vast swathes of Syria and Iraq . Throughout the video the woman's face twists in fury as she demands they stop killing people. 'Do not slaughter anyone and nobody will slaughter you. It's all forbidden. I swear nothing you have done was in the way of God,' she says. 'God is watching what you are doing. 'Those who deny our verses and are arrogant towards them, the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter paradise,' she adds. The video then comes to an end without showing what became of the brave elderly woman. Yesterday Jordanian air force jets bombed ISIS hideouts in Syria, state television said, resuming the intensified raids that ended at the weekend after three days. The raids are the first the Jordanian military have announced since three straight days of aerial bombing - in retaliation for the killing of a pilot - that ended on Saturday. Mouath al-Kasaesbeh was burned to death by Islamic State militants two weeks ago. 'The airforce has bombed and destroyed select targets of the Daesh criminal gang this afternoon,' it said. 'Daesh' is a derogative Arabic term for the militants. Islamic State hostage John Cantlie has told his family to 'let him go' and 'get on with their lives' - days after appearing on a propaganda video which he ominously warned was the last in the series. In an article released last night for the terror group's magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their 'tireless efforts' campaigning for his release. However, he adds: 'Let it go. Leave it be and get on with your lives, all of you'. In an article released last night for the terror group's magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their 'tireless efforts' campaigning for his release . Referring to an interview given by his partner, the photo journalist says: 'That was my fiancee, whom I hope now has long since forgotten me and moved on. 'What can the remnants of one family, smashed and emotionally exhausted after two years of campaigning, be expected to do by themselves.' In the article, Cantlie, 44, has also been made to criticise the international campaign of air strikes against Islamic State, claiming that 'every bomb dropped in Syria or Iraq serves as a recruitment tool for the Islamic State'. Cantlie - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - said the video released three days ago (pictured) was 'the last in this series' The magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh by IS fighters and claims by the group that US aid worker hostage Kayla Mueller had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the Jordanian's shocking murder. There has been concern for the safety of Cantlie since he was captured in Syria in November 2012 together with the now murdered US correspondent James Foley. Eight international hostages, including two Britons, have been executed by the group but during the period of their murders Cantlie has been used for a series of nine expertly-made propaganda videos by IS.","Two ISIS fighters were sitting in a car when the elderly woman approached .

"The true identity of a tramp known only as 'Tea Cosy Pete' who once walked 12 miles to return a wallet with £300 has been revealed after he died on the streets. Homeless Brian Burford, 66, spent more than 30 years living rough on the streets of Swansea city centre in Wales and was given the nickname by locals for his distinctive woolly hat. But it was only after his death last month that his real name was revealed by a coroner and former classmates and friends came forward - including ex-Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams. Scroll down for video . A homeless man, known as 'Tea Cosy Pete', has had his true identity revealed by a coroner after he died. It was found that the  tramp, who had lived rough on the streets of Swansea, was a friend of Rowan Williams . It was also found that he was a gifted young scholar but his life spiralled out of control after he was rejected from Oxford University and then his younger brother tragically died. Dr Williams said he was 'very sad indeed' to hear of his death and remembered him as a man with 'complete integrity'. The Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, said: 'I remember Brian very vividly from schooldays, and was very sad indeed to hear of his death. 'He was - even as a schoolboy - a distinctive character- very withdrawn a lot of the time, but then capable of making some observation that surprised everyone. He attended Dynevor Grammar School with Rowan Williams. Pictured in their school photograph in 1961 is Mr Burford (third from right, front row) and also sitting in the front row (fourth left) is Dr Rowan Williams . Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said he was 'very saddened' to hear of Mr Burford's death and recalled he was a 'distinctive character' and 'lived his life with complete integrity' 'I still recall a strange little poem he wrote in class about crowds and loneliness - we rather made fun of it at the time, but I realise now how deeply it was felt and meant. 'I think he simply saw and experienced life from a different angle from most of us. 'He often had a smile on his face, but it was a smile that ever so slightly suggested that the joke was on everyone else. 'I think that's how he lived his life - seeing differently, with complete integrity.' He was born in Bath and as a teenager, he went to  Dynevor Grammar School, in Swansea, in the 1960s at the same time as the former head of worldwide Anglican church. A memorial service was held in Swansea city centre for Mr Burford and was attended by hundreds of people . A woman wipes a tear at the memorial service after the homeless man collapsed and died in the city centre . Mr Burford was a talented student from a middle-class background who got eight top grade 'O' Levels and three Grade 'A' A Levels. But his rejection from Oxford University and the early death of his brother Bill sent him on a downward spiral from which he never recovered. Wayne Llewellyn, who grew up close to Mr Burford's family, said: 'He was a very keen runner when he was young and I think he won the Mile race at school and he was very bright. 'He had the best qualifications he could get and made an application to Oxford University and very unfortunately for him he was refused entry. 'I believe his rejection despite his top grades may have contributed to his alternative lifestyle. 'Some years later his much loved younger brother Bill, an outstanding rugby player, was killed as a student in London.' Mr Llewellyn said Mr Burford tried to start as a door to door salesman but drifted to a life on the streets, where he wandered for 35 years, carrying his possessions and refusing to beg. Brian Burford (left) became well-known after he walked 12 miles to return a wallet with £300 inside to a man who had dropped it in the city centre the previous evening. Pictured right are floral tributes from locals . He became well-known in the 1990s after walking 12 miles to Kittle in Gower, to return a wallet with £300 inside to a man who had lost it in the city centre the previous evening and refusing a reward. Mr Burford collapsed from a suspected stroke in Castle Square in the city centre and died later in hospital on January 26. A huge outpouring of public grief followed his death and hundreds gathered in the city centre for a memorial service to pay tribute to his 'integrity and honesty'. More than £3,000 has since been raised for a memorial bench in his memory. A tribute paid to him by a Swansea businessman on Twitter said: 'Tea Cosy Pete offered a certain continuity that made many of us feel at home. 'After long flights from East or South Asia and a train journey from Heathrow, I would often pass through Swansea city centre and see Pete. 'We'd exchange a greeting and I'd immediately feel that I was back in Swansea. 'He was not a multi-billion dollar philanthropist but instead inspired people by his simple, gentle and honest ways which in a world driven by ruthless greed was a breath of fresh air.'

"Notorious murderer Kenny Noye (pictured) could walk free within weeks after being granted a parole hearing . One of Britain's most notorious murderers could walk free within weeks after landing a parole hearing, it was reported last night. Gangster Kenny Noye was jailed for life in 2000 after killing 21-year-old Stephen Cameron during a 'road rage incident' on the M25 at Swanley in Kent four years earlier. The 67-year-old used a 9in knife he kept in his car to stab Mr Cameron as the victim's 17-year-old fiancee, Danielle Cable, looked on in horror. The killing triggered an international hunt for Noye, who had already served 14 years in jail for his part in the 1983 Brink's-Mat bullion robbery. He was extradited from Spain in 1998. But  Noye, who was told he must serve at least 16 years in prison when he was jailed at The Old Bailey in 2000, is due to go before a probation panel in May and could be free in weeks, it was reported this morning. Mr Cameron's mother Toni, 70, said today: 'We're disgusted. We don't think he should be allowed a hearing. Life should mean life for us. He murdered our son. 'We're just speechless. He shouldn't be allowed out. He hasn't shown any remorse for what he did. 'We have written a letter last night to the Home Secretary with our complaint about the hearing. 'We first found out about it before Christmas and wrote a letter then raising our concerns. 'Since this all began we now fear for our safety and the safety of our children and grandchildren. 'The whole prospect of him being released has brought back a lot pain and memories from the time. But if you lose a child that pain never goes away, it's one of the most painful things to go through. 'He has taken away our son and his life. He's taken away the chance of a wedding, any grandchildren.' At Noye's trial, the  father-of-two admitted that he had stabbed Mr Cameron to death but insisted he had acted in self-defence. The jury convicted him of murder after pathologist Dr Michael Heath said the injuries suffered by Mr Cameron were 'considerable' and consistent with murderous intent. Stephen Cameron, 21, who was knifed to death by Noye, with his girlfriend Danielle Cable. He died during a road rage fight at the Swanley interchange in Kent in May 1996 . Mr Cameron's father Ken told The Sun: 'He left my son dying in the gutter and fled to Spain, I don't believe for a minute he has changed his ways. It's a load of old rubbish. He'll always be a dangerous man, people will say anything when they know they are up for parole.' Former probation service union chief Harry Fletcher told the paper: 'The most likely outcome of the hearing would be Noye will be transferred to a category D prison in a few weeks. He will then be released into the community with home visits and working experience. There will be another hearing in around six months' time when he could be released on licence. 'The board will take his notoriety into account and the fact the victim's fiancé is in witness protection.' The multi-millionaire gangland killer fled to Spain after the stabbing in 1996 but was extradited two years later. Noye had previously stabbed to death Detective Constable John Fordham who was involved in the police surveillance in the grounds of his 20-acre mansion in West Kingsdown, Kent, in 1985. He was later acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence. Kenny Noye first came to public attention in the 1980s when he was charged with the murder of PC Fordham. Police at the scene of the M25 'road rage' killing of Stephen Cameron. Noye was later arrested in Spain following the 1996 death . The police officer was hiding in the grounds of Noye's Kent mansion as part of an investigation into the 1983 Brink's-MAT bullion robbery, in which a gang stole three tons of gold. Despite knifing the policeman ten times, Noye told the jury at his 1985 trial that he had acted in self-defence and was dramatically cleared of murder. The following year, he was convicted of handling Brink's-MAT gold and jailed for 14 years. During the infamous robbery, six gunmen burst into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, where they doused security guards in petrol and threatened to set them on fire before escaping with £26million. In 1995, a year after his release, Noye agreed to return £3million believed to be part of the proceeds of the raid. He acted after loss adjusters working for the insurers traced the money to bank accounts in Britain and Ireland. Born in Bexleyheath, south London, Noye left school at 15, but was soon seduced by crime and jailed for receiving stolen cars.","Road rage murderer Kenny Noye may be released from prison within weeks .

Fed up with constant trips to hospital, Mr Eyers opted for the amputation in the hope of finally being able to lead a normal life. 'Growing up with the deformed leg was really hard - I had no muscle structure or knee joint and I walked with a really pronounced limp. 'At primary school I was really into sports but it was hard to join in, and I would get bullied. Better: Mr Eyers became a fitness fanatic and started to look into a career in modelling after the amputation . Work: Mr Eyers has modelled for  fashion retailer Boohoo and starred in ads for Tango and Barclays . 'I remember at the age of around seven saying I wanted to have it amputated but I needed to wait until it stopped growing - it felt like this devil attached to me. When I finally got it removed it felt like I’d been reborn.' Finally rid of the leg that had caused him so much pain, Mr Eyers became a fitness fanatic, and started to look into a career in modelling. He eventually came across Models of Diversity, a company that campaigns for more diversity within the modelling industry. Signed on the spot, his career has  gone from strength to strength, and was even crowned Men’s Health Magazine’s Man of the Year. 'Once I’d had my leg amputated I started to gain confidence and went to the gym,' he explains of his impressive career. 'I initially wanted to join the fire service, but I soon realised that it just wouldn’t be possible as an amputee - so I looked at what else I could do and discovered personal training. Help: He is signed to Models of Diversity which aims to get more disabled models onto the catwalk . Excited: Mr Eyers says he hopes his New York catwalk debut will be an 'amazing' experience . New lease of life: Mr Eyers says having his leg amputated gave him a new lease of life . 'I’d really got into the gym and fitness, and then I remember seeing an article about Models of Diversity in a magazine. 'I went along to a photo shoot with them and everything has just snowballed from there.' Mr Eyers has also appeared in campaigns for online fashion retailer Boohoo, as well as in advertisements for Tango and Barclays. He  recently became the face of the charity, Scope. His focus now, however, is on his ground-breaking appearance in New York. 'The organisers of the New York show, FTL Moda, got in touch with Models of Diversity about me and the work I was doing, and after meeting with them, they offered me a chance to be in the show. 'I could hardly believe it. It still doesn’t feel real, but I can’t wait to get out there and get stuck in. It’s such a massive step for me and the modelling industry.' Speaking about his choice of model, designer Urzi, added: 'For me it’s just an honour to be able to work on this amazing project. 'We are so proud to have the opportunity to enhance the amazing skills of these professional Models of Diversity’s models. 'My publicist and my team are constantly at work to create fashion in a unique and sophisticated way to be embraced from the people of the world.' Impressive: His career is hotting up and he was  crowned Men's Health Magazine's Man of the Year .

"For all of the exotic and far-reaching places on the globe, from the highest of peaks to the most remote beaches, a humble British train is among the most adventurous places to pop the question. Travel guide Wanderlust has listed 10 top locations to ask your loved one to be your one and only one that will ensure your proposal story will be one that lives on forever just in time for Valentine's Day, and the Belmond Royal Scotsman train is the UK's only inclusion. On the list at a not shabby at all eighth place, the Royal Scotsman is not just any train but a brilliant way to see the Highlands and beyond. It is listed by the website behind a top three that includes hot-air ballooning over the temples of Bagan in Burma, Iguazu Falls on the borders of Brazil and Argentina and the Unesco World Heritage-listed parks of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The Belmond Royal Scotsman train has been listed among the most adventurous places in the world to propose . The 'romantic' Royal Scotsman makes its way across the horse-shoe viaduct on the west highland line near Bridge of Orchy in Argyll and Bute . The Royal Scotsman  at the Kyle of Lochalsh station (left) and passing Loch Dubh at Polnish near Lochailort (right) in the West Highlands . 'The Royal Scotsman train is known as one of the most lavish ways to travel in Europe,' raves Wanderlust. 'Mahogany clads the train interior and tartan furnishings speckle the decks. 'Choose from five different itineraries, and just wait for that perfect moment to pop the question... while exploring castles in the Highlands, perhaps, or searching for Nessie at Loch Ness? The train itself, coupled with the incredible Scottish wilderness, makes any journey spectacular.' Talk about getting a marriage off on the right track. As with anything connected to nuptials, even a proposal, the Royal Scotsman isn't a cheap location to get down on one knee with prices ranging from £930 for the two-day 'Majestic England' trip between London and Edinburgh to £9200 for the eight-day Grand Tour of Britain that goes to Scotland, England and Wales. Other set journeys on board the nine-car train include the 'Classic' that goes to the Highlands, castles, the village of Plockton and the Cairngorms, the 'Western' covering Loch Lomond, Ben Nevis, Morar and Isle of Bute, the 'Highlands' overlooking stunning scenery and visiting a famed distillery. The dining car of the Royal Scotsman with its mahogany and tartan design - could this be the ideal table at which to pop the question? The Scotsman traverses some of the most picturesque landscapes in Britain with prices costing from £930 for Edinburgh to London trip . Options for getting down on one knee include the dining cars, named Victory and Raven, the observation car or one of the scenic locations it visits. 'Indulge in afternoon tea while sharing stories with fellow guests as the train journeys on,' goes the Royal Scotsman's promotional spiel. 'Nightfall brings cocktails and candlelit dinners before retiring to your cosy cabin to dream of the next day's adventures.' If that hasn't inspired you or your love of trains isn't worthy of such an auspicious occasion though, here are some more options from Wanderlust. How about in At.mosphere, two levels below the observation deck of the world's tallest building the Burj Khalifa in Dubai? Hot air ballooning over Bagan in Burma is No 1 on Wanderlust's most adventurous places to propose marriage . Ballooning is a popular and spectacular way of seeing the ancient city with a range of tour operators offering flights from about £210 . Iguacu Falls in Brazil and Argentina is best seen from a helicopter which can cost from £147 for a panoramic flight through Viator . A man takes in the view of the Valley of a Thousand Hills in KwaZulu-Natal Province which has two Unesco World Heritage-listed parks . The view at twilight from the At.Mosphere Bar on the 122nd floor of the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building . Or in Finland with the sparkling ring worth several weeks pay sparkling in the colours of the Northern Lights? Some more unusual options include not Paris but the Alps villages of Le Monal, Wanderlust's 'most romantic place in France'. Also listed ahead of the Scotsman is Sungai Lebam, in the wetlands area of the Malaysian Peninsula, where a private boat tour among the mangroves in the moonlight is about as romance-inducing as it gets. Behind hitting the rails in the Highlands is the peak of Morocco's snow-capped Mount Toubkal, north Africa's highest mountain, and the 27-mile-long Matanuska Glacier in Alaska, 'home to some spectacular features like ice falls, moulins, crevasses and ice caves'. The Northern Lights illuminate a lake and could be the perfect slash of colour for a diamond engagement sparkler . Not Paris but the hamlet of Le Monal is the 'most romantic place in France,' says Wanderlust in their list of top places to propose . The cascading Kota Tinggi waterfalls at the Gunung Panti Recreational forest in the wetlands area of the Malaysian Peninsula . North Africa's highest peak, Mount Toubkal in Morocco is also one of its most beautiful and romantic - perfect to pop the question . And rounding out the list, the 27 mile-long and four miles wide Matanuska Glacier in Alaska, the largest glacier in the US accessible by car .","The Belmond Royal Scotsman train is the UK's only inclusion on list of adventurous proposal locations .

"Fitbit devices have once again come under fire for causing painful skin rashes. The California-based company admits that a 'limited percentage' of users have reported skin irritation from constantly wearing the fitness tracker. It is now advising people to take a break from wearing the device - despite the gadget being designed for constant use. The California-based company admits that a 'limited percentage' of users have reported skin irritation (left) from constantly wearing the Charge, Charge HR and the Surge (right) Fitbit trackers . Fitbits are meant to be worn, in order to track your steps, sleep and other health metrics . 'According to our consulting dermatologists, [the rashes] are likely from wearing the band too tight,' Fitbit said in a statement to Dailymail.com. It said other causes could be 'sweat, water, or soap being held against the skin under the device; or from pressure or friction against the skin.' 'They should resolve quickly when users take a break from the device, usually within hours or days. If symptoms persist, contact your doctor.' The Fitbit Surge - which costs $250 - was launched four months ago. Other bands affected include the Charge and Charge HR which cost $130 and $150. 'According to our consulting dermatologists, [the rashes] are likely from wearing the band too tight,' Fitbit said in a statement to Dailymail.com. Pictured is a rash from its Force wristband, which has also caused problems . Last year, the company voluntarily recalled its Force wristband after nearly two per cent of users said they suffered skin irritations . ABC7 news in San Francisco has reported that it had found more than 200 instances of new Fitbit rash complaints on social media. Shaun Ewing posted a picture of his rash on Twitter with the message: 'Having a break from my @fitbit Surge. Might need to stop wearing it - nice rash (and my skin isn't usually sensitive).' Another user, Laura Evans wrote 'I love my new @fitbit minus the awesome, itchy rash that comes with it. Ugh.' This isn't the first time Fitbit users have reported skin rashes. Last year, the company voluntarily recalled its Force wristband after nearly two per cent of users said they suffered skin irritations. 'The reactions we are seeing with new products are different from the allergic reactions we saw with Force, and are not uncommon with jewellery or wearable devices that stay in contact with the skin for extended periods,' Fitbit told DailyMail.com. ABC7 news in San Francisco has reported that it had found more than 200 instances of new Fitbit rash complaints on social media. Laura Evans wrote 'I love my new @fitbit minus the awesome, itchy rash that comes with it. Ugh' 'The reactions we are seeing with new products are different from the allergic reactions we saw with Force, and are not uncommon with jewellery or wearable devices that stay in contact with the skin for extended periods,' Fitbit told DailyMail.com . Force's housing and band were held together with adhesive, which was determined to be the cause of nearly all allergic reactions. The company's newest products - the Charge, the Charge HR and the Surge - are held together with screws. 'We also significantly reduced the amount of surgical-grade stainless steel,' a spokesperson for Fitbit said. 'We have conducted extensive testing with laboratories and consulted with top dermatologists to develop stringent standards.' Fitness bands could be as much as 40 per cent off the mark when it comes to counting the number of calories burned, according to a recent study . The follows the results of a study which suggests wearables may not be as accurate as you think. Researchers tested some of the most popular models, with participants taking part in a number of activities while wearing seven different bands. The results showed the bands could be as much as 40 per cent off the mark when it comes to counting the number of calories burned by the wearer. More than 70 million 'smart' wrist bands, chest straps, ankle trackers and sports watches were sold worldwide last year. And the number is only expected to increase. That is why it is important to determine how accurate the monitors are assessing the energy burned by the wearer, Yang Bai, the lead researcher on the Iowa State University study said. He asked more than 50 healthy participants, aged between 18 and 65, to choose three different activities of varying intensity. Each performed 20 minutes of sedentary activity - such as reading, watching TV, typing - 25 minutes of aerobic exercise on a treadmill, and 25 minutes of resistance exercise, with five minutes of rest between each activity. They wore Fitbit Flex, Polar Loop, Misfit Shine, Nike+Fuelband SE, Jawbone UP on the wrist, Actigraph GT3X+ on the waist, and BodyMedia Core on the left arm. At the same time they were being monitored with the Oxycon Mobile, a portable system that measures calories burnt by analysing oxygen levels in exhaled breath. Results showed the BodyMedia Core was the most accurate device, with the Fitbit Flex coming in second place. This supported a previous study which rated them as the two most accurate.","Rashes have been reported from the Charge, Charge HR and Surge .

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . These shocking images show Chinese vendors who guarantee their customers fresh donkey meat - by bashing the animals to death with a sledgehammer in front of them. Lines of donkeys were seen tethered to the roadside awaiting execution so that the meat could be instantly butchered and sold directly to passing motorists travelling home for Chinese New Year. The pictures, taken in China's northern Hebei province, show the donkeys tethered next to strips of meat and parts of carcasses sitting on bloodstained tables or hanging from poles. And a cut weighing around 1.5kg sells for the equivalent of £10. These shocking images show Chinese vendors who guarantee their customers fresh donkey meat by butchering the animals to order . Lines of donkeys were seen tethered to the roadside awaiting execution in China's Hebei province in order to be sold to customers travelling home for Chinese New Year . The animals that were killed were forced to the ground, and then as one of the men pulled the donkey's head forwards, the second belted it with the sledgehammer. Once unconscious, the donkeys have their throats cut with the blood being collected in plastic barrels. Last week, photographs emerged showing a flourishing trade in roadside dog meat sales - with the animals kept alive and butchered to order from people who want to ensure they get a fresh cut. Sales have been booming ever since people started heading back to their home towns for Chinese New Year celebrations and wanting to take a gift of fresh meat with them for friends and family. Chinese animal rights activist Guo Li, 29, said: 'The law stipulates that animals need to be killed in a hygienic and contamination free location to make sure the meat is safe for eating. 'Even on those grounds alone these roadside offenders should be arrested and locked up. 'But as you can see they are carrying out this sickening trade in broad daylight with nobody doing anything.' He added: 'They argue that in many cases people are sold meat which is not fresh and slaughtering animals live guarantees that it is. The donkeys were forced to the ground and as one person pulls the donkey's head forwards, the second beats it with the sledgehammer . Vendors are aiming to ensure they get the best price possible by selling the meat fresh after killing the animals in front of customers . 'In addition, they argue that people know they're getting donkey meat because they can see it being cut off the bone in front of them.' The pictures were reportedly taken in the city of Baoding and Mr Guo said similar scenes with dogs and donkeys and other animals are seen across the country, particularly at this time of year. He said: 'There is no evidence that these animals don't have disease and in the case of the dogs they are often simply snatched off the streets and butchered to order.' Donkey meat is regarded as a delicacy in China and fetches much higher prices than other cuts of meat. By selling it fresh and killing the animals in front of customers, these vendors are aiming to ensure they get the best price possible.","Lines of donkeys were seen tethered to the roadside awaiting execution .

"Republican leaders again urged President Barack Obama to sign legislation approving the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline at a ceremony on Friday at which House Speaker John Boehner officially lent his own name to the bill. The White House has steadfastly promised to veto the legislation when it arrives at the Oval Office - a vow it reiterated on Thursday. Congressional Republicans hope to use Obama's opposition to building the pipeline that they say would create 42,000 jobs as a cudgel against the Democratic President. After listing the benefits of building the oil transportation system at today's press conference, Boehner told the president, 'Do the right thing. Sign this bill, and help us create more jobs in America and help us create a healthier economy.' Scroll down for video . House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio signs the bill authorizing expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline on Friday on Capitol Hill in Washington. From left are, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. John Hoeven, theSenate sponsor of the pipeline bill, Boehner, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Rep. Kristi Noem, Rep. Kevin Cramer and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton . Boehner is pictured here shaking the hand of North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, who has long fought for approval of the pipeline expansion that would travel through his home state . Boehner's signature is seen on the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act as well as that of Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, President of the Senate Tempore. The hotly debated Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline cleared final Congressional approval and was bound for the desk of President Barack Obama, who has vowed to veto the law . The Republican House Speaker was flanked at the formal enrollment ceremony by Sean McGarvey, President of the North America's Building Trades Unions, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the bill's author, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, among other Republican members of Congress from states that would be directly affected by the realization of the XL portion of the transnational conduit. 'We're hoping common sense will prevail here, and the president will sign this extraordinary jobs bill,'  McConnell said. Both the House and the Senate have OK'd the Keystone expansion multiple times yet never with enough votes to override Obama's promised vetoes. A House vote on Wednesday to pass the latest Senate bill drew 29 Democrats and passed 270 to 152, falling 20 votes short of what was needed. The president first said he would not sign the bill because the pathway of the pipeline was in dispute. Even after a Nebraska court sided with the system's makers, Obama said he would leave it to the State Department to approve or deny TransCanada's permit request. A White House spokesman confirmed on Thursday that Obama had not changed his mind. 'As you know, the approval process for this pipeline is one that predates this administration, and is hubbed at the State Department. We're going to let that process unfold,' Obama spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters travelling with the president. 'The President has announced that he would oppose and veto any legislative maneuvering to circumvent that process. So he will indeed be vetoing it.' The State Department paused its review process last spring as it awaited the verdict of the Nebraska Supreme Court and has not publicly announced plans to restart it. Not gonna happen: The White House has said in no uncertain terms that Obama won't lend his name to the Keystone XL expansion bill and anxious lawmakers will just have to wait for the State Department to resume its stalled review of the permit request for the oil transportation system . Though Boehner signed the bill today he will not immediately send it to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Following Monday's federal holiday, Congress is scheduled to be in recess for the remainder of the week. Hoeven told reporters on Thursday the legislative branch would wait until it resumed its activities to present Obama with the document 'so attention is brought to it' when he rejects it. The White House would not say on Thursday if Obama would make a statement to the press announcing his decision or if he would issue a written statement. Republicans' inability to force the bill into law, despite having majorities in both chambers of Congress and the support of more than three dozen of their colleagues across the aisle, highlighted the struggle the GOP faces during Obama's last two years in office. 'Now we have the Senate and so our constituents think ""now you can stop Obama"". Well we don't have 60,' Florida Rep. Tom Rooney told the Associated Press on Thursday, referring to the number of votes it takes in the Senate to overcome a minority party filibuster. 'Honestly it's going to continue to frustrate not only our side but the people who elected us that nothing is going to change until we get a new president,' he said, acknowledging the virtual stalemate.","Republicans hope to use Obama's opposition to building the pipeline that they say would create 42,000 jobs as a cudgel against the Democrat .

"A holidaymaker who lost his camera overboard while kayaking in Australia six months ago is set to get his holiday snaps back in tact after it was discovered in a river. Traveller Chris Hesford, from Jersey was kayaking with friends off the coast of New South Wales when a rogue wave swept away his GoPro camera. Chris was halfway through a round-the-world trip and lost two months' worth of photos with the camera, which he never expected to see again. British backpacker Chris Hedford, from Jersey, was on an amazing round-the-world trip when he lost his camera . But last week Australian Steve Carmody contacted the 22-year-old out of the blue via Facebook to say he had found his camera - in a riverbed 60 miles away from where it was lost. And despite six months of being dragged underwater, the 32GB memory card was still in tact. Law student Chris, 22, who lives in London, said: 'I got a message out of the blue from an Australian man, who said he'd found my camera. 'I was astonished - I thought it was lost for good. The GoPro contained images of Chris' travels so far and he didn't have any copies of the pictures taken . The backpacker had travelled tgrough America, to Dubai and enjoyed the sunshine in Fiji before arriving in the United States . 'Steve found the camera, and uploaded a couple of pictures to Facebook and started a campaign to try and find its owner. 'I think it took about two weeks, but it went viral and somebody recognised me. 'I couldn't believe it - I thought at first he was pulling my leg, but he wasn't, and now the camera is in the post on its way to me. What a nice guy.' Chris lost his camera near Byron Bay in September last year, but it was found by Australian Steve, who decided to start a campaign to find its owner. Chris Hesford was travelling alone so snapped plenty of selfies at iconic sites like the horse shoe bend in the Grand Caynon . The 22-year-old globetrotter also visited New York City on his travels before heading down to Fiji and Australia . Logging on to Facebook, Steve wrote: 'OK Facebook do your thing. If we can track down this bloke I have 32 GB of precious memories to be returned. 'If you lost a GoPro in the surf at Fingal Rovers SLSC in NSW Australia, the camera has been found on Fingal Beach at the Tweed River mouth. 'Bad news is the GoPro is dead, but your memory stick survives. Inbox me if you know this bloke.' Chris is now waiting for the GoPro and memory card to land in the post within the next couple of days. The Australian, Steve Carmody, who found the camera posted some of Chris' pictures on Facebook in his bid to find Chris . Chris' camera contained a whopping 32GB of pictures and video of his trip, which took in Washington (pictured) New York and Arizona . The iconic tourist snaps were Chris' way to document the once-in-a-lifetime trip but were all lost when his camera fell overboard . The images record his travels across America and Fiji before he arrived in Australia and he had only been in the country for a week before he lost the camera. Chris added: 'I was just in shock, really - I thought they were gone for good. 'The pictures were of my trip of a lifetime, so I was really upset by losing them. 'It's amazing that Steve made such an incredible effort to find me. 'I will be eternally grateful to Steve - and if he's ever in London I'm definitely buying the first pint. 'He's asked for nothing in return - he's just a good Aussie bloke who has really shown the good in humanity.' Despite spending six months underwater and travelling a total of 60 miles, the camera's memory card survived in tact . Chris also travelled via Dubai, where he managed to take a pictures of himself stood by the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel . One of the last pictures taken before Chris lost his camera shows him posing at Sydney Harbour after he had arrived in Australia . Steve's Facebook post was shared by more than 8,000 users, and it is thought an acquaintance of Chris spotted him in the picture and pointed Steve in the right direction. Steve said: 'It's very cool, it just goes to show the power of social media.'","Chris Hesford, from Jersey, was halfway through a round-the-world trip when he lost his camera .

"Gamblers who won $1.5 million at a casino after realizing the cards hadn't been shuffled have been ordered to return the money. State Superior Court Judge Donna Taylor has sided with the Golden Nugget casino in its long-running dispute with 14 gamblers who say the fault wasn't theirs and they should be allowed to keep their winnings. At issue were games of mini-baccarat played in April 2012 using decks of cards the casino had paid a manufacturer to pre-shuffle but that hadn't been shuffled. Once players realized the pattern in which the cards were emerging they drastically upped their bets from $10 a hand to $5,000 and won 41 straight hands. Bummer: Gamblers who won $1.5 million at the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City after realizing the cards hadn't been shuffled have been ordered to return the money . In the ruling, issued Monday and publicized by the casino on Thursday, the judge determined the games were illegal under state law because they didn't conform to gambling regulations specifying the way each game must be played. 'The dealer did not pre-shuffle the cards immediately prior to the commencement of play, and the cards were not pre-shuffled in accordance with any regulation,' the judge wrote. 'Thus, a literal reading of the regulations ... entails that the game violated the (Casino Control) Act, and consequently was not authorized.' She ruled that the gamblers must return any cash paid to them by the casino and any outstanding chips in their possession. The casino in turn must refund the gamblers the money they first put up to play. The Golden Nugget was pleased with the court's ruling, casino general manager Tom Pohlman said. 'We believe it was the right decision,' he said. A lawyer for the gamblers did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the decision. A lawyer for the casino's partner, Landry's Inc., said he expects the decision to be appealed. The Golden Nugget bought what were supposed to be pre-shuffled cards from a Kansas City manufacturer, which acknowledged in court it failed to shuffle them. The casino said its litigation with the manufacturer has been resolved but a confidentiality agreement prevents it from revealing details. The judge's ruling was the latest in a long series of decisions that have seesawed between favoring the casino and favoring the gamblers. The owner of the casino, Texas billionaire Tillman Fertitta, originally decided to let the players keep their winnings, but that offer was contingent on them dropping other claims they made against the casino, which they declined to do. The casino paid out about $500,000 in winnings for the disputed games. About $1 million in chips remains outstanding.","At issue were games of mini-baccarat played in 2012 cards the Golden Nugget had paid a manufacturer to pre-shuffle but that hadn't been shuffled .

He is a living prince . of the Jewish people.' 'He is the face of the murdered 6 million (Jews killed in . the Holocaust). So I think that his view on the prime minister's . speech sounding the alarm as to the Iranian nuclear program . carries a unique authority that transcends some of the political . circus that has affected the speech,' Boteach said. Boteach, the author of books including 'Kosher Sex,' was the . Republican nominee in 2012 for a seat in the U.S. House of . Representatives but lost to Democratic incumbent Bill Pascrell. Wiesel, 86, who has written extensively of his imprisonment . in Nazi camps and was awarded the Nobel in 1986, is the latest to join a fray that has exposed . deep divisions among American Jews over the policy and propriety . behind a speech in which Netanyahu is expected to criticize . Obama's effort to forge an international nuclear deal with Iran. 'Should we not show our support for what might be the last clear warning before a terrible deal is struck?' he asks in the ad. 'As one who has seen the enemies of the Jewish people make good on threats to exterminate us, how can I remain silent?' John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of . Representatives, invited Netanyahu to appear before Congress. Neither Boehner nor Netanyahu consulted the White House before scheduling the visit. Detractors say Netanyahu, . who has long warned the West of the dangers of a nuclear-armed . Iran, is working with Republicans to thumb their noses at Obama, . a Democrat. Some of Netanyahu's critics accuse him of placing ties to Republicans above Israel's relations with the United States, its most important ally. U.S.-born Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to Washington, is a former Republican political operative. This week J Street, a Democratic-leaning pro-Israel group, . started a petition drive opposed to the Israeli leader's speech. J Street said it had gathered more than 20,000 signatures for a petition asking Jews to say 'Bibi does NOT speak for me,' using Netanyahu's nickname, in response to Netanyahu calling himself not just Israel's prime minister but also 'a representative of the entire Jewish people.' Prominent Jewish leader Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation . League denounced that effort as 'inflammatory and repugnant.' Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, said American Jews . had long been divided, with Republican Jews backing Netanyahu's . right-wing government and liberal Jews more in line with the . Israeli opposition. 'Perhaps the biggest mistake the prime minister has made is . allowing his speech to be the wedge that has driven that . argument more public,' Ben-Ami said. He said about 70 percent of Jewish Americans vote Democratic . and roughly a quarter identifies as Republican. 'But today, with a really divided society on both sides of . the ocean, both there and here, it isn't possible any longer for . there to be a single voice representing the views of all Jewish . Americans,' Ben-Ami said. The Republican Jewish Coalition lobbying group launched a petition countering J Street's campaign, titled 'Stand with Bibi,' and has promised to publicize which U.S. lawmakers boycott the speech. More than a dozen Democratic lawmakers have also excused themselves from the remarks, including Jewish Rep. John Yarmuth, who said in a statement, 'We know what he is going to say.' Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and the most senior U.S.senator, said this week he would not attend Netanyahu's speech either and accused Republicans of orchestrating what he called 'a tawdry and high-handed stunt that has embarrassed not only Israel but the Congress itself.' Matt Brooks, the Republican Jewish Coalition's executive . director, countered: 'It's important for the Jewish community to . know that members of Congress have a choice ... whether they're . going to stand with the prime minister of Israel and the Jewish . community in opposition to a nuclear Iran, or whether they're . going to put partisan politics ahead of that and stand with . President Obama.' Not only will the White House not participate in Netanyahu's address to Congress, it won't entertain him at all while he is in Washington that week. Vice President Joe Biden's office has said the VP will be in Central America at the time of Netanyahu's visit and will therefore be unable to preside over the Senate that day. President Barack Obama has said he won't meet with Netanyahu during his trip to Washington as he feels it would be 'inappropriate' with an election in Israel around the corner.","Outspoken New Jersey Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach is funding the ad campaign that will run in two  The New York Times and Washington Post .

"Thai authorities have been mocked for a social media campaign urging teenagers to refrain from having sex on Valentine's Day. Ahead of February 14, the Culture Ministry's Moral Promotion Center issued their usual warning to young people to avoid sex outside marriage. But this year, the ministry's campaign was bigger after a recent survey showed 83% of young people said they planned to have sex on Valentine’s Day. So they also launched a Twitter hashtag in the heavily publicized campaign to urge youngsters to return to their respective homes after enjoying a dinner date. Thai authorities have been mocked for their Twitter campaign urging teens to avoid pre-marital sex on Valentine's Day. File photo . Young people were asked to support the campaign called 'Just a Meal for Valentine's Day' by tweeting #DinnerOnly in Thai - but instead, the request attracted mockery. This year's campaign came amid a morality overhaul initiated by Thailand's military government, which took power from an elected administration following a coup last May. The Ministry of Culture said a recent survey it conducted found 83% of Thai teenagers planned to have sex on Valentine's Day, according to local media reports. Earlier this week, police asked parents and teachers to inform children of the 'dangers' of Valentine's Day and to avoid 'risky behavior'. Police also warned nightclubs across the country not to admit underage customers. Major General Patipat Suban Na Ayuuthaya said that all police units would be on alert until Sunday to 'increase vigilance in risky areas' such as nightclubs. The ministry launched a bigger campaign this year amid concerns after a recent survey showed 83% of young people said they planned to have sex on Valentine’s Day . He urged entertainment venues to call police hotlines to reports cases of youths trying to enter. One all-girl's school in Bangkok took the extra step of holding a Valentine's Day self-defense class earlier this week. Thai media showed policewomen on stage in the auditorium of the Sainampeung School flipping a man before an assembly of hundreds of students. Authorities annually warn youths to avoid 'inappropriate activities' on Valentine's Day, which is widely celebrated in Thailand. Narathip Pumsap, the Moral Promotion Center's director, said: 'Parents and teachers should create correct understanding about Valentine's Day with children. She added that instead of engaging in intimacy, young people should 'show love to their family, society, themselves and the country,' the Khaosod newspaper reported. Despite its reputation as a freewheeling destination for sex tourism, Thailand's socially conservative authorities are on a constant mission to uphold the country's traditional Buddhist values. Hollywood movies are censored with sex scenes and cigarette smoking pixellated out, and Thai soap operas are not allowed to show alcohol consumption.","The Culture Ministry's Moral Promotion Center issued their usual warning .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has caused outrage among MPs less than a week after  surviving a leadership spill - this time for sacking veteran Liberal MP Philip Ruddock as his chief government whip. Mr Abbott's move yesterday not only angered his backbench but could again risk the questioning of his leadership, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Some even went as far as describing Mr Abbott's decision as 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions' amid claims the move was Mr Ruddock's punishment for not seeing off the leadership challenge, the ABC reports. Mr Ruddock is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, as he first elected to  for the seat of Parramatta at by-election in 1973. He went on to hold many titles, including the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs from 1996 to 2003 during John Howard's time in office. Queensland MP Scott Buchholz will be taking over Mr Ruddock's position, which he has held since September 2013. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) sacked chief government whip and veteran Liberal MP Philip Ruddock (left) on Friday . Mr Ruddock is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, as he first elected to for the seat of Parramatta at by-election in 1973 . Queensland backbencher Andrew Laming publicly expressed his disapproval for Mr Abbott's decision, saying it was 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions'. 'We really needed a week of healing, not wounding, and I think it really has set us back a fair bit particularly because Philip Ruddock was such a respected character,' Mr Laming told the ABC. One backbencher, who has not been named, described Mr Abbott's decision on Friday afternoon as 'another disastrous call', the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 'The PM had my vote on Monday even though he refused to get rid of Peta Credlin [the chief of staff],' another MP told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'He has now lost my vote because he had no right to get rid of Philip Ruddock.' Others told The Australian that Mr Abbott felt Mr Ruddock had not been supportive enough of the prime minister. Mr Abbott however denied such claims, saying his decision was based on having 'a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench and that means it was very important to renew and refresh the whips team'. Mr Abbott's move to dump his chief whip on Friday not only angered his backbench but also risks the questioning of his leadership once again . In a statement released yesterday, Mr Abbott did not offer any reasoning behind his decision and instead thanked Mr Ruddock for his contribution. 'As Father of the House, Philip has given over four decades of service to the Australian Parliament and the Australian people. He was a senior minister throughout the life of the Howard government and was shadow cabinet secretary in opposition. Later this year, he will become the second longest serving parliamentarian in our history. No one has done more than Philip helping immigrants to feel at home in their new country and helping members of migrant communities to participate in our national life,' the prime minister said. 'I look forward to his future contribution to the government and to our country. He remains an important counsellor for Coalition members of parliament and will continue to serve as Member for Berowra with distinction. 'These changes will be in place for the next parliamentary sitting period.' This comes nearly a week after Mr Abbott asked his chief whip at the time, Mr Ruddock, to call a special Party Room meeting for 9am on Monday February 9 to consider the spill motion. The announcement was made on Sunday, just after Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull praised Mr Abbott for holding the ballot on Tuesday to give his colleagues time to discuss the matter on Monday before casting their vote. The prime minister held onto his leadership after 61 MPs voted against a spill motion and 39 for it. But soon after surviving the spill, Mr Abbott came under fire after he described job losses under the Labor government as a 'holocaust of jobs' in parliament on Thursday. Mr Abbott subsequently apologised and withdrew the comment. He replaced the word 'holocaust' with 'decimation'.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott sacked chief government whip Philip Ruddock yesterday .

"Chris Rock joined in on the Brian Williams mocking Wednesday night with a filthy routine at a charity event in New York City that kicked off fashion week. The event for amFar, an HIV/AIDS charity, took place at Cipriani's downtown location, which Rock used in his Williams bashing. 'I'm a little late, I went to the other Cipriani,' Rock said. 'I was uptown. Brian Williams told me it was there. Lying bastard.' But Rock wasn't done, reports Page Six. 'Six months' suspension? That's called fired where I'm from': Chris Rock joined in on the Brian Williams mocking Wednesday night with a filthy routine at a charity event in New York City that kicked off fashion week . 'Six months' suspension? That's called fired where I'm from. Got more games [off] than Ray Rice.' Rock also had some fun with his fellow speaker Rosario Dawson. 'I've known Rosario since she was a B-cup,' he said, 'She won our hearts with her...megasmile, her down-to-earth compassion, and the greatest t**s in the business.' In handing Brian Williams a six-month suspension for misleading viewers, NBC Universal chief Steve Burke says his chief anchor deserves a second chance. Whether he actually gets one is an open question. Time is renowned for its healing powers but in this case, time also offers reasons for the split to become permanent. Naomi Campbell, Rosario Dawson, Marina Abramovic and Chris Rock pose at the amFar Gala, the unofficial kickoff for New York Fashion Week . NBC Universal bought time with the suspension, hoping to remove an unflattering spotlight on its most prominent personality after he falsely reported flying in a helicopter hit by an enemy grenade in the Iraq War. Veteran Lester Holt will fill in. With 'Nightly News' atop the ratings for almost all of Williams' decade-long tenure as its lead anchor - and back into the 1990s with Tom Brokaw - Holt will be watched closely to see if he can maintain that lead. If he can, that may lessen NBC's desire to bring back a more costly anchor with doubts cast on his trustworthiness. ABC in the past year maintained and even improved its 'World News Tonight' ratings after replacing well-known anchor Diane Sawyer with David Muir. That indicates viewers care more about the content of the broadcasts than its anchors, said Andrew Tyndall, a consultant who monitors the evening newscasts. 'Not only is (Williams) dispensable, the business model is wrong,' he said.

"The U.S. Air Force is sending 12 of its 'tankbuster' jets back Europe as part of the response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine. The European command revealed the group of A-10s will be deployed as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve which was set up last year after Putin's troops annexed Crimea. They will be stationed at Spangdahlem air base in Germany along with 300 airman so they can be called to action by Eastern European allies at short notice. Senior officials said the unit were being sent to reassure allies their commitment to European security is still a 'priority' following months of tension in the region. Scroll down for video . Increasing presence: The U.S. Air Force is sending 12 A-10, also known as 'tankbuster' jets, back Europe as part of the response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine . According to Stars and Stripes, they will remain in Europe for around six months before another rotation. Designed in the 1970s, the aircraft also known as a Warthog was developed to support ground troops against the armored tanks of the Soviet Union. They can carry a range of bombs and missiles and are fitted with seven-barrel 30 mm Gatling gun that can fire almost 4,000 rounds per minute - enough to blow up a tank. A 'bathtub' titanium shell also protects the pilot from any ground fire. Tom Jones, vice commander, United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa (USAFE), said in a statement: 'The Air Force is increasing rotational presence in Europe to reassure our allies and partner nations that our commitment to European security is a priority.' A release on the USAFE website read: 'The A-10s are being deployed as part of a Theater Security Package in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve. 'While deployed they will conduct training alongside our NATO allies to strengthen interoperability and to demonstrate U.S. commitment to the security and stability of Europe. The A-10s and Airmen are deploying from the 355th Fighter Wing, Davis-Monthan AFB, Ariz.' Tensions: The European command revealed the group of fighter jets will be deployed as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve which began last year after Putin's troops annexed Crimea. Ukrainian soldiers are pictured on a tank in Debalsteve in the east of the country on Thursday . Despite the movment of the A-10s, they are set to be retired by the forces in 2019 and replaced by the F-35s as the main ground support fighter jets. The government has spent nearly $400billion on the updated models. They are also being purchased by NATO allies including the UK, Italy, Australia, Canada and Turkey. Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff told CNN in January: 'It's not about not liking or not wanting the A-10. It's about some very tough decisions that we have to make to recapitalize an Air Force for the threat 10 years from now.' Last year they were forced to ground a whole fleet of the 97 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets to allow for further inspections of the engines following a fire. It is the ugliest aircraft in the Air Force's arsenal. The A-10, often called a warthog, was designed to destroy Soviet tanks and troops on the ground. Officially the Thunderbolt II, it was quickly nicknamed the Warthog for its unusual looks, . It was specifically designed around its main weapon, a 30mm cannon which fires 4,000 rounds a minute. The plane can fly low and slow, coming down to 50ft to shoot at or drop bombs on enemy positions. Its top speed is just above 400mph but it can go as slow as 150mph and 'loiter' for hours above targets making it an effective deterrent as well as an attack plane. The Warthog is covered in 1,200lbs of titanium armor, making it invulnerable to attack from anything but heavy weapons. Even when hit it is designed to fly home on one engine, with no tailfin and half a wing missing. On board the single-seater the pilot has at his controls the cannon, which is accurate to 4,000ft, and fires depleted-uranium shells, as well as Maverick air-to-surface missiles, 500lb free fall bombs, and Hydra air-launched rockets. Despite USAF attempts to retire the fleet, it is expected to remain in service into the 2020s. At one stage when the Air Force suggested retiring its more than 300 A-10s the Army indicated it would take them over as soldiers are so keen on its close support capabilities.

"Billy Jo Kelly, 35, (pictured) threatened to stab a Waitrose worker with a syringe while shouting she had HIV . A Waitrose worker has spoken of the moment a woman threatened to stab him with a blood-filled needle while shouting she was HIV positive. The man approached Billy Jo Kelly, 35, after he noticed her acting suspiciously when she entered the store in Willerby, Hull. When the man confronted her, she waved the blood-filled needle in his face before leaving the shop with a trolley filled with £500 worth of goods. The supermarket worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline: 'A woman came into the shop looking very suspicious. 'I was alerted to the fact she was at the welcome desk trying to exchange products she had clearly just picked up from the shelves. 'When I went over to challenge her she started shouting for someone else and when they didn't appear she pulled out a syringe and threatened to stab me. 'The main thing going through my head was to make sure everybody was safe. A few pounds' worth of stock wasn't worth a staff member getting injured. 'I stepped away and called the police and told the other members of staff to avoid going near her. 'There was another guy who was taking stuff off the shelves and someone waiting in a car outside. 'She then left with a trolley of goods totalling over £500, including a DVD player, hair straighteners, a duvet cover and toiletries. It was a really broad selection of stuff.' He added: 'I have been in retail 20 years and that's the second time someone has pulled a syringe on me. 'The staff are shaken up by what happened.' Kelly threatened the supermarket worker at this Waitrose in Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire . Billy Jo Kelly, from Hull, was jailed for 26 weeks after the theft at the Waitrose store. She fled the scene in a car with co-defendants Mark Kelly and Michael Melville at speeds over 60mph. Mark Kelly, 35, of Hull and Melville, 45, from Hull, were also jailed.

"Paris may be considered the romance capital of the world, but it turns out that Spain is the most amorous nation. Spanish people sent more love-related messages on Viber than any other region last year, ahead of France, Italy and Japan. And this may be linked to the fact the language was recently found to be the happiest and most positive by mathematicians. Spanish users of messaging app Viber sent the most love-related stickers during 2014, and a separate study found that Spanish is the most positive language. People in Spain use words such as ‘love’ and ‘laughter’ more than any other region. Spanish couple Javier Bardem (left) and Penelope Cruz pictured . Viber said its Spanish users sent the most love-related stickers on its messaging app during 2014 and the ‘kissing couple’ sticker topped the list globally. In a separate study, a team of researchers, led by Dr Peter Dodds from the University of Vermont, built a database of billions of individual words from 10 of the most popular languages using online sources. This included Google Books, Twitter, subtitles on films and TV shows, song lyrics and the New York Times in Spanish, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Arabic, Indonesian, Korean, Russian and German. In a separate study, a team of researchers studied 100,000 words across 10 languages (a yellow box indicates the row language is more positive than the column language, and a blue background shows the reverse) Spanish was the happiest (pictured) and Chinese was the most negatively skewed . Once all of these words were plotted, the researchers found that every language studied was inherently positive, and more words fell on the right of centre than left. Three examples are shown in Spanish, English and Chinese (top to bottom). The centre line is the average, yellow is positive and blue is negative . 1. Spanish . 2. Portuguese . 3. English . 4. Indonesian . 5. French . 6. German . 7. Arabic . 8. Russian . 9. Korean . 10. Chinese . From this, the scientists compiled a list of 10,000 most commonly used words in each language and labelled each as either positive and negative. For example, the words ‘lying’ and ‘cried’ were plotted on the negative side, while ‘love’ and ‘laughter’ were positive words. Once all of these words were plotted, the researchers found that every language studied was inherently positive, and more words fell on the right of centre than the left. ‘Using human evaluation of 100,000 words spread across 10 languages diverse in origin and culture, we present evidence of a deep imprint of human sociality in language,’ said the study. ‘The words of natural human language possess a universal positivity bias, the estimated emotional content of words is consistent between languages under translation, and this positivity bias is strongly independent of frequency of word use.' To test these findings, the team applied their analysis to books including Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, (top) Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment (middle), and Alexander Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo (bottom). They mapped the emotional content and plotted peaks and troughs throughout each . And at the top of this list was Spanish, which had the highest skew towards positive sentiment. Chinese was at the opposite end of the scale. Research from money transfer site WorldRemit found that on Valentine’s Day, people send £35 ($54) to £60 ($92) extra on average to loved ones. When it comes to the amount sent, Ghanaians are the most generous, sending an average of £63 ($97) more on Valentine’s Day than on any other day of the month. People from Bangladesh and Zimbabwe were in second and third place, spending an average of £54 ($83) and £52 ($80) extra respectively. English was in third place. To test these findings, the team later applied their analysis to books including Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, and Alexander Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo. They mapped the emotional content and plotted peaks and troughs throughout each. Language used in Crime and Punishment was predominantly positive but ended on a very low point. The Count of Monte Cristo had the lowest dip at around the third-way mark but ended very positively. Moby Dick had the highest peak a quarter of the way, sentiment fell at the half-way mark and the book ended on a low. These peaks and troughs in positive and negative language related to high and low points in the narrative, going someway to prove Mr Dodds' research. The findings were published in the journals Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Separate research from Twitter found that Sweden is the country most likely to tweet 'I love you.' The site has created an interactive ‘World of Love’ map that reflects the volume of tweets mentioning this phrase in 100 different languages. This volume was then related to the total population of each country to establish the ranking. The UK came in at 51 out of the 173 countries that Twitter operates in, and the top five countries were Sweden, Slovenia, Israel, United Arab of Emirates and Norway.

"Two Victoria's Secret models suffered an awkward fashion mishap last night when they turned up to New York Fashion Week's amfAR gala wearing the same dress. Lais Ribeiro, 24, and Heather Marks, 26, both looked stunning - albeit unoriginal - as they arrived at Cipriani Wall Street in their matching teal cut-out Cushnie et Ochs gowns, which retail for $2,395, and even accessorized them with similar black clutches. The New York-based label, launched in 2008 by designers Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochs, is clearly proving popular. On the previous night over in Nashville, Tennessee, models Emily Ratajkowski and Sara Sampaio sported an identical frock by the same designer - this time a $1,495 orange number - at the Sports Illustrated 2015 Swimsuit bash.

Both Ms Ribeiro and Ms Marks stand at 5ft 11in, are represented by Women Management and are based in New York. Brazilian-born Ms Ribeiro, whose ample bosom better filled out her dress, wore her hair tied back and teamed her smoky eyes with red nail varnish; while Canadian-born Ms Marks wore her blonde hair loose and opted for pale make-up and nails. Both models have worked for Victoria's Secret in the past. Ms Marks has appeared in several of the lingerie giant's ads and walked in its 2006 fashion show.

She was scheduled to appear in the 2012 show too but sprained her ankle during rehearsals and had to pull out. Had the girls been lent their Cushnie et Ochs gowns directly from the designers, whose label is favored by the likes of Karlie Kloss and Michelle Obama, they likely would have been warned they would be matching. It is possible, therefore, that they hired the dress from Rent the Runway, where it is currently available costing $300 for a four-day rental.

"A mother who headbutted and then bit part of a woman's nose off in a 'shark-style' attack during a children's pantomime was today jailed for six years. Tina Love, 29, lunged at mother-of-three Julie McDonald, 50, before pinning her down and then biting a chunk from her nose. The 'nasty assault' happened after a 'stupid and childish' disagreement about a table during a Jack and the Beanstalk show at Butlins Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. A 3cm by 3cm piece of the victim's nose was found on the floor after the attack on April 11, 2013. Jailed: Tina Love was today sentenced to six years after violently assaulting mum-of-three Julie McDonald at Butlins in Bognor Regis. She was found guilty of wounding with intent following the vicious attack where she bit part of the victim's nose off and spat it out . Today Love - who attended court with a pre-packed suitcase after a jury took just 48 minutes to convict her of wounding with intent - was locked up for six years. Prosecutor Rachel Beckett said mum-of-three Love had launched a sustained assault, described as like a 'shark attack', which left Ms McDonald scarred for life and suffering low self-esteem. In a victim impact statement read in court, Ms McDonald said the attack had left her living a 'nightmare that I just can't seem to wake up from'. Part of Ms McDonald's nose had to be reattached during surgery following Love's 'appalling' attack on her, prosecutors said. Love, from Dartford, Kent, was found guilty of wounding with intent following a trial which ended last month. Chichester Crown Court heard the day before the assault there had been some 'interaction' between the McDonald family and the defendant. Love's two young children were seen 'laughing' and 'swearing' at Ms McDonald's son, who has 'severe learning difficulties'. During her trial, a jury had heard how on the night of the attack, the whole McDonald family went down to the Centre Stage of the Manhattan Building at Butlins to watch the pantomime. After finding a table, which appeared to be free, the victim sat down but was confronted by Love who said: 'Oi, that's my table'. The defendant then waved her finger in Ms McDonald's face and asked: 'What are you going to do about it?' Love then 'lunged' at Ms McDonald and 'headbutted' her before biting her nose. Ms McDonald, a full-time carer, felt it was like her 'entire nose was being bitten off'. Pantomime: The attack happened at Butlins Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, after a 'stupid and childish' disagreement about a table . Jailing Love, Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith QC said: 'You have been found guilty by a jury on clear evidence in what was a vicious attack on Ms McDonald. 'You undertook this attack with the intent of causing Ms McDonald serious harm. 'This happened in front of a theatre full of children and families at 7pm, looking to enjoy an evening of entertainment watching the pantomime. 'It was in a theatre in front of 450 people - a large number of them children - and virtually all of them were families, so the timing could not have been worse. 'The incident arose from a stupid and childish dispute about whose table was whose. 'You lost control, you wagged your finger in her face and when she started to move you launched a headbutt with all of your might and then bit her nose. 'You bit and bit and you actually bit off a significant chunk of her nose which you then spat out on the floor.' Disgraced: Mum-of-three Tina Love was today sentenced to six years following the assault in April 2013. Victim Ms McDonald described the assault as like a 'shark attack' Ms McDonald, from Aylesbury, Bucks, described the assault as a 'shark attack'. She said: 'She launched herself at me and I felt this person biting my nose with full force. I have never been bitten by a shark but that is the only think I can liken it to. 'It was like being attacked by a shark. There was this person biting my nose with all of her might. It felt like my whole nose was being bitten off. I was completely traumatised.' Today, Love sat in the dock with her head in her hands as the victim impact statement described the toll taken on Ms McDonald, who has a disabled child. Ms McDonald said she was rushed to hospital, and had two black eyes, a scar across the top of her nose and a yellow surgical sponge pinned to her face to hold her nose together. Sleepless nights, anxiety and fear followed the attack, she added, and she cannot breathe easily from her misshapen nose, which she has to cover in sun-screen in all seasons as it reddens. In her victim statement, she said: 'Up until the night of the incident we had enjoyed our stay at Butlins. The children had a great time and we were ready to go home the following morning. 'We attended the theatre that evening looking forward to the pantomime. My two younger children had gone to the front of the stage to watch the show whilst (my daughter) had taken her homework to the show to study for her exams. 'What happened to me next has devastated me beyond words. The assault on me was unwarranted, unprovoked and has left me scarred for life. 'I was left in the theatre covered in blood with one of my children next to me as I screamed out in shock and pain. 'You can't hide from this. It is there every day staring me in the face when I look in the mirror and I have to deal with this for the rest of my life.' Neil Guest, defending, said Love will lose her local authority home and be separated from her three children, aged eight, five and four. Describing her as a 'true, caring mother', he said in mitigation that she had no previous convictions, had not been in trouble since the attack and was at low risk of re-offending. Mr Guest said: 'She's a true, caring mother who helps strangers and gives to charities. What came over her that night we simply don't know. Whatever did happen was totally and completely out of character.'","Tina Love, 28, handed six year sentence after attacking Julie McDonald .

"Secret internal emails reveal Osama bin Laden was washed, wrapped in a sheet and slid into the sea for his burial in accordance with Islamic burial tradition - and no sailors saw it. The heavily blacked out emails sent between U.S. military officers were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and are the first public disclosure of government information about the al Qaida leader's death. Bin Laden was killed on May 1, 2011, by a U.S. Navy SEAL team that attacked his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Shrouded in mystery: New details have emerged about the burial of Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden (pictured) One email, stamped secret and sent on May 2 by a senior navy officer, briefly describes how bin Laden's body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet, then placed in a weighted bag. According to another message from the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier's public affairs officer, only a small group of the ship's leadership was informed of the burial. 'Traditional procedures for Islamic burial was followed,' the May 2 email from Rear Admiral Charles Gaouette reads. 'The deceased's body was washed (ablution) then placed in a white sheet. 'The body was placed in a weighted bag. A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. After the words were complete, the body was placed on a prepared flat board, tipped up, whereupon the deceased's body slid into the sea.' The email also included a cryptic reference to the intense secrecy surrounding the mission. 'The paucity of documentary evidence in our possession is a reflection of the emphasis placed on operational security during the execution of this phase of the operation,' Rear Adm Gaouette's message reads. Recipients of the email included Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General James Mattis, the top officer at US Central Command. Adm Mullen retired from the military last September. Bin Laden was given a sea burial, in accordance with Islamic traditions, after being transported on the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, pictured here in the Arabian Sea .

The compound where U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad on May 5, 2011 . Earlier, Rear Adm Gaouette, then the deputy commander of the navy's Fifth Fleet, and another officer used codewords to discuss whether the helicopters carrying the SEALs and bin Laden's body had arrived on the Vinson. 'Any news on the package for us?' he asked Rear Adm Samuel Perez, commander of the carrier strike group that included the Vinson. 'FEDEX delivered the package,' Rear Adm Perez responded. 'Both trucks are safely en route home base.' Video seized from the walled compound and released by the U.S. Department of Defense shows a man, identified as Osama bin Laden, watching television . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House . Although the Obama administration has pledged to be the most transparent in American history, it is keeping a tight hold on materials related to the bin Laden raid. In a response to separate requests for information about the mission, the Defence Department said in March that it could not locate any photographs or video taken during the raid or showing bin Laden's body. It also said it could not find any images of bin Laden's body on the Vinson. The Pentagon also said it could not find any death certificate, post-mortem report or results of DNA identification tests for bin Laden, or any pre-raid materials discussing how the government planned to dispose of bin Laden's body if he were killed. The Defence Department also refused to confirm or deny the existence of helicopter maintenance logs and reports about the performance of military gear used in the raid. One of the stealth helicopters that carried the SEALs to Abbottabad crashed during the mission and its wreckage was left behind. People who lived near bin Laden's compound took photos of the disabled chopper.","Emails are first public .

"Jailed: Tara Sharrock, 23, was sentenced to two years in prison for setting fire to her own home with her three-year-old daughter inside . A mother who calls herself 'Tarty Tara' has been jailed for two years after setting fire to her own home with her three-year-old daughter inside following a drunken row with her boyfriend. Tara Sharrock, 23, who had been drinking wine and smoking cannabis on the night of the blaze, set light to a sofa  - filling the house with toxic fumes as her child slept in her bed. When her partner Danny Fisher and two police officers rescued Sharrock and her child from the house, she falsely blamed him for starting the fire screaming: 'You have done this, you b*****d. You have torched my f*****g house.' The blaze left the rented terraced property with severe heat and smoke damage  - but miraculously no one was injured. In the run up to the fire, the mother, from Burnley, Lancashire, had been in a drink-fuelled rage following an argument with her boyfriend - in which she claims he threw her 'right through a window'. The pair had earlier been involved in a row outside a florists near their home - which resulted in the store's window being smashed. At Burnley Crown Court, Sharrock, who calls herself 'Tarty Tara - a fully time mummy' on Facebook, admitted arson and being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Her daughter is now in care. Prosecutor Lisa Worsley told the hearing the incident occurred on September 2 last year after two police officers on patrol were flagged down by Mr Fisher, who told them a window had been broken at a florists after Sharrock tried to punch him. One officer remained with Mr Fisher while the other went to check on the welfare of Sharrock. At first she refused to let him in, but eventually unbolted the door allowing him entry. Sat on a sofa in  room at the back of the house, Sharrock, who was smoking, told the officer she was 'f*****g sick' of Mr Fisher who she said had just thrown her 'right through a window'. Scroll down for video . Risked daughter's life: The mother, who had been drinking wine and smoking cannabis on the night of the blaze, set a sofa alight with a naked flame - filling the house with toxic fumes as her child slept in her bed . Drunken row: The mother, 23, had been in a drink-fuelled rage following an argument with her boyfriend Danny Fisher (pictured together right) - in which she claims he threw her 'right through a window' Miss Worsley said: 'The officer noted Sharrock smelled strongly of alcohol, her eyes were glazed and he thought she was very drunk. He also saw Sharrock had some blood on her chin and a minor cut on her right arm. 'The officer told her to wipe the blood off so she wouldn't frighten her three-year-old daughter, who was in bed upstairs. 'The officer left to return to his colleague who had stayed with Mr Fisher minutes away and arrangements were being made to board up the window.' Miss Worsley said that about five minutes later, an officer heard a female voice coming from Sharrock's home shouting 'b*****d'. She continued: 'He went to the street, found no sign of Sharrock and for about 15 minutes, he periodically went back to the street to see if there were any problems. 'At about 11pm, he heard an alarm going off and the sound seemed to be coming from Sharrock's home. 'He went up a side alley by the house and saw black smoke coming from it and heard banging from an upstairs window with Sharrock shouting ""Help, my f*****g house is on fire"".' The prosecutor said the officer tried to get in and failed but was helped by his colleague and Mr Fisher who led Sharrock and her daughter to safety. False accusation: When her partner Danny Fisher and two police officer rescued Sharrock and her child from the house, she falsely blamed him for starting the fire screaming: 'You have done this, you b*****d' An officer noted that the flames were coming from the rear room where the Sharrock had - but she began screaming at Mr Fisher: 'You have done this you b*****d. You have torched my f*****g house.' Miss Worsley continued: 'The officers explained that Mr Fisher had been with them and there was no chance he had set the house on fire.' Sharrock was arrested and taken to the police station and an expert later found the point of origin of the fire was a section of a corner sofa in the lounge. The prosecutor said: 'He noted this sofa contained a safety label saying it was resistant to cigarette ignition.' The blaze released a large volume of toxic fumes, caused severe heat and smoke damage and the heat build-up had made double glazed window units crack. The expert conduced there had been deliberate ignition with a naked flame. Sharrock was not insured for deliberate damage and the cost of repairs to the property was £10,000. There was also a £1,000 loss of rent. Lucky escape: The fire left the rented terraced property in Lancashire (above) with severe heat and smoke damage - but miraculously no one was injured . Mr Jeremy Coleman, defending Sharrock, said a care order had been made in respect of the child, but her daughter might be returned to her after her release. Mr Coleman said: 'This was very much out of character for her. No accelerants were used to start the fire. One way or another she was thrown through a glass window shortly before this incident.' Mr Coleman said his client had been getting hold of the child when someone gained access to her house and pulled her out. He added: 'The child was already in her arms.' The lawyer said Sharrock had 'had a difficult childhood' and had been in foster care - while also having a background of alcohol and cannabis abuse. He continued: 'Whilst being in custody is a controlled environment, it's to her credit that she has made steps to address these problems in constructive manner. It's more as a result of this incident taking place and being remanded in custody.' Condemned act: Jailing her at Burnley Crown Court (above), the judge said: 'You set fire to your house. It could have resulted in the death not only of your daughter, but you and other people along that terrace' But passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Michael Blakey said: 'This was a deliberate ignition with a naked flame.This offence is a serious offence, It's a terrace set of houses, it's 11 o'clock at night. 'You set fire to your house. You had your child with you at the time. It could have resulted in the death not only of your daughter, but you and other people along that terrace.' 'I accept this was a spur of the moment thing, something to do, perhaps, with the fact you had had a fight with your boyfriend and you went back in a temper and did what you did. It wasn't at all a planned attack.'","Tara Sharrock, 23, set sofa alight after drinking wine and smoking cannabis .

"A mother teaching her 14-year-old daughter to drive has been shot in the head in an apparent road-rage attack in Las Vegas. Police believe the shooter followed 44-year-old Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire. The mother-of-four is not expected to survive the attack. Tragic: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in an apparent road rage attack on Thursday . Speaking on Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, told The Associated Press: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive. 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.' Mrs Meyers, 44, let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said. She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. He described the girl as emotionally distraught. Distraught: Mrs Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, said his 14-year-old daughter who was driving is distraught . Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car. Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said. Investigators were looking for the shooter and at least one other person in the vehicle, Garcia said. Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side. Meyers also said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police.","Tammy Meyers, 44, let her daughter take the wheel in school parking lot .

"Two potential jurors in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have expressed sympathy for him, it emerged on Friday. Voicing an opinion which will play a major role in the defense case, both said they wondered whether Tsarnaev was led into participating in the bombings through his admiration for his older brother, Tamerlan, who died days later. The news comes as Judge George O'Toole Jr continues to question members of the public in a bid to secure an unbiased jury. He has so far questioned 193, and 54 have qualified so far. Prosecutors say Dzhokhar, then 19, and Tamerlan, 26, carried out the bombings to retaliate against the U.S. for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. Defense? Two prospective jurors expressed sympathy for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in preliminary questioning . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a gunbattle with police days after the bombings. Many of the prospective jurors have expressed anger over the attack and compassion for the people who were killed and injured in the explosions. But one prospective juror, a self-employed construction contractor, said he has two brothers and three sisters and 'can relate' to looking up to an older brother. He described how his brother liked to drink and how he 'thought that was a really great thing to do.' 'Someone I looked up to led me in that direction,' he said. The man seemed to quickly change course when he mentioned his five-year-old grandson. He said he can't help but think of Martin Richard, the eight-year-old boy who was killed in the bombing. 'It comes back to me that it was a very selfish act of some people to have robbed a child of their life like that,' he said. Another prospective juror, a freelance journalist, said she is opposed to the death penalty and doesn't think she could consider sentencing Tsarnaev to death. 'I'm not sure about his motivation and his psychological state and his relationship with his brother. I know what the media told me, but I don't know the whole story, really,' she said. Suspect: Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 charges stemming from the bombing that left three dead and more than 260 wounded, as well as the later shooting death of a police officer.  He has pleaded not guilty and could face the death penalty if convicted . Later, she said she was sad to know that the only other alternative for Tsarnaev is life in prison without the possibility of release. 'It's sad to me even that there's not a chance of parole for him,' she said. Others questioned on Friday said they could not be impartial because they already believe Tsarnaev is guilty. One man said he has several friends in the Arlington Police Department who participated in the manhunt for Tsarnaev. 'I think just from what I've read and heard and seen prior to being called in as a juror, I think I've formed a pretty strong opinion,' he said. Many people questioned during jury selection have spoken of obvious conflicts, including financial hardships, strong opposition to the death penalty and personal connections to the marathon, victims or first responders who treated those injured in the blasts. Judge George O'Toole Jr. has questioned 193 prospective jurors. He said that as of Friday, 54 people have been provisionally qualified, meaning they will move on to the next round of jury selection. O'Toole has said he wants to provisionally qualify 70 people before prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers will be allowed to eliminate up to 23 people each for strategic reasons. A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be chosen. Jury selection is scheduled to resume on Tuesday. Also on Friday, Tsarnaev's lawyers asked the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston to have the full court hear their request to move the trial out of Massachusetts. A three-judge panel agreed to hold a hearing next week. Tsarnaev's lawyers have repeatedly argued that he cannot get a fair trial in Massachusetts because of the emotional impact the deadly attack had here.

"Pet owners hoping to give their pooches a taste of romance have turned to speed-dating in the hope of finding puppy love. Dozens of dog-owners took their pampered pooches to a pet boutique in Wales for the doggy dates, swapping getting muddy in the park for a civilised meeting. The speed-dating event is the brainchild of pet-lover Leanne Couch, who says both owners and pets prefer making a connection indoors rather than outside in the cold. Dozens of dog owners took their pups to the parlour for the doggy dating night hoping to help their pooches find love . 'It's been absolutely amazing,' said the pet fan. 'My [bichon frise] Lucy has had her eye on a few men.' Couch, who staged the event at her Mucky Pups pet parlour in Cardiff, proclaimed the doggie-dating night to be a huge success. As 'Who let the Dogs Out?' boomed out of the speakers, owners appeared to be enjoying the event almost as much as their pets. One guest said she brought her pooch along because it is 'a great opportunity for her to meet other dogs and hopefully find some love.' These two pups look like they have found their perfect match sharing a kiss after the doggy dating event . These pet owners and their pet pooches take a break from doggy speed-dating and have a drink . In a video of the night, Couch opens proceedings by saying: 'This evening I've held a doggy speed dating event and doggy disco. 'It's the first of it's kind and the first event that we've held.' The event certainly seemed to go down well with the canine guests, with one set of dogs getting very close on the dance floor. What's more, the dogs weren't the only ones to get lucky, with Couch saying afterwards that a few human matches had been made as well. At the doggy speed-dating it was a chance for the dogs, and their owners, to get to know one another . This little puppy looks keen on his new pal who wore a cute jumper to the event .

"Forget give the dog a bone, this little pup wants a slice of ice. YouTube user 4score1957 from California filmed Walter the German Shepherd determinedly trying to get his paws on an ice cube. It takes him just over three minutes to finally get the lump of frozen water inbetween his teeth. At one point he growls at the slippery lump as his frustration mounts. 'Get it Walter!' a woman encourages in the background. After numerous attempts, the pup finally gets his mouth on the prize. His audience give him a big 'good boy' in celebration. Walter was eight weeks old when the ice cube debacle was filmed. He has since grown into an adult size. Apparently he's ditched ice cubes and prefers getting his paws on beer. To date the video of Walter attempting to eat ice has been watched more than 13,000 times. One viewer said their dog had the same reaction when they first came face to face with the chilly blocks.

"One of the three people to win $564.1 million in this week's Powerball was from Puerto Rico. And Twitter went crazy. The Atlantic island has been U.S. territory since 1898, with its inhabitants subject to U.S. taxes. But it seems those facts are well-kept secrets in the mainland. 'WTF .... since when could you win a Powerball jackpot in Puerto Rico? Don't they use the Euro as currency?' exclaimed @Matty_lee87. Scroll down for video . 'If #PuertoRico is too good to be a state, then they don't deserve to win our #Powerball! #Shenanigans' @DillonChance surmised. The lucky Puerto Rican, who has yet to be identified, will be sharing their lot with somebody from Texas and one from North Carolina. While the latter two have been broadly accepted by the cyber world, their islander neighbor came under some flak. Latino Rebels reported that the backlash started when Lisa Sanchez, of KLAQ Morning Show, said on the radio that Puerto Ricans should not be eligible to enter the draw because the island is not a state. Her Twitter account is no longer active. Her comment was followed by hundreds like this from @Sniper, who fumed: 'If I'm the guy from Texas or NC I'm pissed I have to share the powerball with someone from Puerto Rico. Should have to speak English to win.' Reaction: Puerto Ricans hit back at the slew of comments slamming their island as 'foreign' Reacting to the outburst, Julio Ricardo Varela, editor and founder of Latino Rebels, wrote in a blog post: 'This silly story was the perfect storm of so many issues: culture, identity, colonialism, history and oh yeah, the Powerball drawing. 'The hope here is that this post forced the conversation so that more Americans dedicate real attention to Puerto Rico and its people in a way that goes beyond ignorant tweets. 'I know that sounds silly, but when one ridiculous story basically gets more traffic in one day than what this entire page got in 2011 you tend to believe that the topic truly matters, and you just hope this new energy can lead to real dialogue.' The only identified winner so far is mother-of-four Marie Holmes, 26, from Shallotte, North Carolina. Holmes said that she scared her kids, one of whom has cerebral palsy, after she found out she had won and began screaming that they 'didn't have to struggle anymore'. Historic: The Powerball jackpot  reached $500 million for Wednesday night's draw, making it the fifth largest prize in U.S. history . Yeehaw!: The Texas lottery tweeted tonight that they have a Powerball winner somewhere in their state . She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children. The numbers of the fifth largest jackpot in U.S. history were revealed at 11 p.m. on Wednesday. The winning numbers for the $564.1 million jackpot were 11-13-25-39-54. The Powerball red number was 19 and the Powerplay was 3x. The $500 million pot - which equates to a cash value of $337.8 million - had been building steadily for two months. If no one were to win the Powerball then the jackpot for the next drawing on February 14 could have equaled $650 million making it one of the largest lottery game jackpots in U.S. history. To win, the players needed five numbers and the Powerball number. The odds of winning are one in 175 million. Each ticket costs just $2. The lottery is played in 44 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Powerball jackpot was last won on November 29. A Washington woman who bought her first-ever lottery tickets on a whim on Thanksgiving Day won $90 million. February 2014 was the last time that the Powerball reached the current prize amount. Jackpot winners receive either payments over 29 years or a smaller cash lump sum.","One of three winning tickets on Wednesday was in Puerto Rico .

"A rabbi has been accused of secretly videotaping more than 150 nude women at a Jewish ritual bath. Barry Freundel was charged with voyeurism in October last year in relation to recordings of six women while he was at Kesher Israel Congregation in Georgetown. He denies the charges. Following an investigation, it has been claimed Freundel had filmed 152 women. During a meeting with victims Wednesday evening at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, prosecutors discussed the number of victims revealed by an investigation along with the benefits of a plea deal in the case. Voyeurism: Rabbi Barry Freundel is accused of secretly filming women as they showered and changed at the Keshre Israel Congregation . The meeting was closed to the press but three people who attended told The Associated Press what was discussed. Prosecutors told victims, their spouses and some lawyers representing them that an investigation had determined Freundel had filmed 152 women. They said 88 of the women had been filmed within the last three years. They said another 64 were filmed going back to 2009, though a statute of limitations bars prosecutors from charging Freundel with voyeurism based on those recordings. A mikvah is used most frequently by people converting to Judaism and by observant Jewish women seven days after the end of their menstrual cycle as a way of becoming closer to God. Freundel faces up to six years in prison if convicted. Freundel, 63, was a rabbi at the Kesher Israel synagogue in Washington for over 25 years and a prominent orthodox rabbi before his arrest on voyeurism charges. Court documents accuse him of setting up a recording device disguised as a digital clock radio in the changing and showering area of The National Capital Mikvah, a ritual cleansing bath affiliated with Kesher Israel that opened in 2005. Synagogue: Freundel is accused of setting up a recording device disguised as a digital clock radio to film 152 women as they changed and showered at Jewish ritual bath . Police arrested Freundel on October 14 after a person associated with the mikvah discovered the hidden camera. They initially found videos of six women entering and exiting a mikvah shower, and court documents say Freundel appears on film setting up the recording device. A search of his home turned up other media storage devices, and he has since been fired from the synagogue. The next hearing in the case is February 19.

"A row involving some of the most senior legal figures in the country erupted yesterday over accusations that a judge was removed from a trial of journalists to ‘improve the prospect of conviction’. Lawyers representing four Sun journalists accused of illegally paying public officials for stories claimed ‘something funny had been going on behind the scenes’ after a judge who heard their first trial – which ended with a hung jury – was suddenly removed. Judge Richard Marks QC emailed defence barristers following the move saying: ‘It has been decided (not by me but by my elders and betters) that I am not going to be doing the retrial.’ Nigel Rumfitt, QC, speaking on behalf of the accused, demanded an explanation yesterday, saying the secretive ‘backstage manoeuvre’ was highly unusual and unfair. Mr Justice Sweeney, left, denied that Judge Richard Marks, right, was replaced to increase the chance of a conviction during the retrial of four Sun journalists who all deny making unlawful payments to public officials . But one of the UK’s top judges, Mr Justice Sweeney, reacted with fury to the suggestion that Judge Marks had been replaced by Judge Charles Wide QC simply to secure more convictions in a retrial. Judge Wide is the only judge to have presided over a trial where there has been a successful conviction of a journalist over unlawful payments to public officials for stories, after a succession of similar cases have ended in acquittals. Mr Rumfitt told the Old Bailey yesterday that time and money would be saved if Judge Marks continued to handle the case. But Mr Justice Sweeney blasted his submission as ‘absurd’. Raising his voice, he thundered: ‘It might be thought to be a sad day when it is suggested that... a fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that a judge exercising a judicial function had deliberately taken or approved an administrative decision to inappropriately favour one side over the other in litigation of any type. Judge Charles Wide, pictured, will handle the retrial which is expected to start at Kingston Crown Court on September 21. ‘I wish to state, emphatically, that Judge Wide was not chosen, or approved, because of his view to date (on a critical legal issue in the case). Nor was he chosen, or approved, in order to improve the prospects of conviction of these defendants. ‘In any event, the suggestion made is absurd. This is simply the replacement, for good reason as one would surely expect, of one fair judge by another fair judge.’ Mr Justice Sweeney went on to say Judge Marks’s email had been ‘significantly misconstrued’, adding that his words were meant to be ‘light hearted’. He also rejected suggestions that the decision was made in secret, saying Judge Wide was been appointed in an ‘administrative judicial decision’ because Judge Marks was already committed to several trials this year. The Sun’s head of news Chris Pharo, former managing editor Graham Dudman, reporter Jamie Pyatt and former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll all deny unlawful payments to public officials for stories. Last month a jury failed to reach a verdict on the majority of the charges. Judge Marks ordered a retrial and told the court the case would be scheduled at Kingston Crown Court on September 21 and it would be preferable if I was to deal with it’. When he was removed defence barristers objected, pointing out that Judge Marks had made a ruling on a key element on the charges, while the new judge had taken a different view in a case with similar charges. But Mr Justice Sweeney, who took responsibility for the switch as Lead Presiding Judge on the South Eastern Circuit, said the legal issue would be settled by the Court of Appeal.

"An Arizona mother who let her three-year-old son pick out her outfits for five days as part of a fun bonding activity may have brought out her son's hidden talent for style. Summer Bellessa, a mother of two, fashion blogger, and actress  decided to let her three-year-old son Rockwell dress her last week and posted pictures of his daring choices on her blog The Girls with Glasses. When it became clear that Rockwell may have inherited his mother's touch for fashion,  Bellessa let her son choose one final outfit and posted a video to YouTube today of the styling session that almost has over 1,000 views. Scroll down for video . He's done it again!: Three-year-old Rockwell chose this funky gold and polka dot outfit for his mother to wear as she runs her errands . The short video began in mommy's closet crammed with colorful shoes and outfits to choose from. Rockwell was immediately drawn to a pair of matching gold flats in Bellessa's closet. Those that read Bellessa's first blog post on Babble.com might remember that Rockwell sometimes likes to pick out two different types of shoes but now he's moved on to choosing two types of skirts. 'Polka dots!' exclaims Rockwell as he tugs with his little arm on a dress in his mother's closet. Even though Rockwell can pick out his outfits he still needs mommy's help reaching the clothing sometimes. Going for the gold: Rockwell picks his mom a pair of golden flats to wear and then chooses some quirky items to go along with them . Rockwell's next decision is a long sequin skirt for his mother to wear under the dress. Yes, under the dress. Rockwell is no fashion minimalist as proved by the fact that he chooses a flower ring along with three necklace's for his mother to wear. Bellessa explains that one of the necklaces belonged to Rockwell's great grandmother, another testament to the fact that style runs in their family. Polka dots!: Rockwell can't get enough of Minnie Mouse's style so he chose a polka dot dress for mom . Never too much gold: Rockwell pics a long golden sequin skirt for mommy to wear under her dress . As promised, Bellessa takes to the streets to run errands in Rockwell's choice of outfit. Looking quirky, confident, and playful it's no surprise that Bellessa turned heads everywhere she walked. 'I have picked out my son’s outfits almost every day of his three years on this planet. I thought it would be fun to turn the tables and let him pick my outfits out for a few days,' said Bellessa in a blog post she wrote forBabble.com posted recently. Head turning: These pedestrians couldn't help but stop and stare at Summer Bellessa's daring outfit . Switching roles: Summer Bellessa (left) decided to let her three-year-old son Rockwell pick out her outfit for five days to see what looks he could come up with . On day one of the experiment that created a true stylist, Rockwell chose a laid back rock n' roll chic look for his mom. 'The first few items were great: my Bob Dylan tee, with a gray skirt, and tights. I think I’ll put this in my rotation. Fabulous choices, Rock,' wrote Bellessa of the conversation with her son. When Rockwell told his mother to wear nude shoes along with black tights she was a little hesitant but took his advice anyway. When showing the outfit to her husband later that day she expected him to laugh but he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. 'I walked down the stairs to show off my outfit to my husband. I waited for a laugh, but he didn’t notice anything different,' she wrote. On day two Bellessa said that Rockwell chose her favorite outfit so far which consisted of a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, polka-dot leggings, and gold pointy shoes which she says she wouldn't have thought to wear. Rock n' roll chic: Summer Bellessa enjoyed most of her son Rockwell's rocker outfit but was less enthused about the nude heels she normally wouldn't pair with black tights . 'These polka dotted Lula Roe leggings look great with my Mickey T-shirt. And although I wouldn’t have worn it with these shoes, it does have a fun feel to it. It’s almost like homage to Minnie,' she wrote. Day three was a flower filled outfit that sent her son Rockwell through the roof with excitement. 'I like flowers' said Rockwell as he pointed to flowery socks and a petal patterned sundress. 'They both have flowers,' he said. He then enthusiastically paired the outfit with pink striped shoes and a green jacket. While Bellessa said she felt a little self-conscious walking around in her outfit that day one woman actually complimented her. 'Side note: I was a little self-conscious running my errands that day; but again, to my surprise I didn’t get one double-take or stare of curiosity. Instead, I got a woman who stopped me to tell me she liked my socks!' she wrote. Mommy's favorite: Summer Bellessa said that Rockwell chose her favorite outfit on day two which consisted of a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, polka-dot leggings, and gold pointy shoes . Day four proved to be a bit of a challenge for mother and son when Rockwell chose three shirts but no bottoms to go along with it. 'Mommy can’t go outside without any pants on,' said Bellessa. 'How about we switch one of these shirts for a pair of pants?,' she added. Rockwell understood and chose the closest pair of pants along with two different types of leopard print shoes. On day five, Rockwell chose his mother another pair of mismatching shoes, this time two boots: one blue and one brown. Rockwell chose a shirt with arrows on it for his mother and desperately searched for pants with arrows on it as well but later settled for a pair of jeans. 'I guess you have to look for some pants that have arrows on them,' he told his mother with a stern face. Tired and exhausted from choosing his mother's clothes, Rockwell was pleased it was the last day of outfit picking. 'His busy toddler schedule is packed with a lot of fun things and picking out my outfit every day was starting to take too much out of his day. When it came down to it, he’d rather be painting or riding his bike,' wrote Bellesma. Bellessa said that the experience taught her that role reversal with children can be therapeutic. She also said it taught her to take more risks with her wardrobe, though she may not start wearing no pants and mismatched shoes anytime in the near future.

"France's top baguette baker has attacked his country's attitude to work after he was ordered to stop opening his shop seven days a week. Stephane Cazenave has been told he will face a €1,500 (£1,100) fine if he fails to adhere to a law which states that all shops selling bread must close one day a week. Mr Cazenave, who runs a bakery in Saint-Paul-les-Dax, in south-west France, says the 1999 prefectural order means he will lose €250,000 (£185,000) a year and will be forced to lay off some of his 22 staff, who work five-day weeks. Furious: Stephane Cazenave says he will be forced to lay off staff if he is not allowed to open seven days a week. He said: 'I am treated like a thug just because I asked to work. Working shouldn't be a crime in France' The ruling has sparked a debate in France, with many viewing the baker's plight as a symbol of all that is wrong with anti-business regulations. Currently French MPs are debating a bill seeking to cut red tape and inject more flexibility into the French labour market. Mr Cazenave, who won 'best baguette of France' award last year, told TV channel France 3: 'I am treated like a thug just because I asked to work. Working shouldn't be a crime in France. 'I opened seven days a week three and a half years ago. I create jobs and wealth and I don't see why one would hinder me doing so.' He emphasised that all his employees were given two days off a week, and that the ban was on the bakery itself. The Socialist government insisted it is promoting more flexibility, but said bakers themselves helped draw up the rules. Strict: French law states that all shops selling bread must close one day a week . Jean-Pierre Crouzet, head of the national bakers' and confectioners' confederation, said it made sense to uphold the rules to encourage competition by obliging people to buy bread elsewhere at least once a week. He said: 'They aren't to prevent people from working but to ensure a balance, to promote the quality of products.' Cazenave's case has succeeded in galvanising the fractious opposition centre-Right, split over how to deal with the far-Right Front National. 'That work can be seen as a crime in our country and the passion of a craftsman bridled in such a way should be a wake up call for us to the absurdity of our system,' wrote Francois Fillon, a former prime minister with the centre-Right UMP party. A petition called 'Let Stephane Cazenave work' has garnered 30,000 signatures. Francois Bayrou, head of the centrist Modem group, also supported the baker, saying: 'There is perpetual suspicion, an inquisitorial doubt about those who want to work.' In a country whose unemployment has hit record levels, he said: 'One gets the impression that the desire to create new jobs is viewed as something bad in France and is punished.' Alba Ventura, a political commentator on RTL radio, said the theory of 'stopping people who can or want to work more' to create jobs was precisely the same argument as that used for the 35-hour working week, whose effects many see as disastrous.","Stephane Cazenave told he is not allowed to open bakery all week round .

"Pest control budgets have been slashed by a quarter by local authorities, prompting expert warnings of a plague of 'super-rats'. Information released to Labour by councils  has revealed deep cuts in the amounts being spent on controlling vermin. Across 200 local authorities in England, pest control budgets have been cut by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010. There has also been a 16 per cent cut in the amounts spent on street cleaning. Pest control budgets have been slashed by a quarter by local authorities, prompting expert warnings of a plague of 'super-rats' Some authorities insist they have taken steps to provide better value for money, accounting for reductions in budgets. But others admit they have stopped providing pest control services altogether. Traditionally, people have been able to call out pest control officers from their local authorities if their homes are infested with mice, rats, wasps or other pests. Many councils have offered free assessments, and then made subsidised charges for proofing, poisons or other recommended measures. The decline in local authority services means more people are likely to attempt ineffective and sometimes dangerous DIY solutions, increasing the numbers of pests, experts said. Reports this year suggest that rats in the UK are becoming bigger, and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of control. So-called 'super rats' are expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year. Labour MP Hilary Benn said pest control budgets had been reduced by a quarter in real terms . Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that some rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons. In counties including Berkshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Kent, all the rats tested were found to have immunity to poison. Hilary Benn, Labour's shadow communities and local government secretary, said: 'Street cleaning and pest control budgets have been reduced by a quarter in real terms and Eric Pickles has failed to live up to his vows before the last election on waste collection. 'Taken in the round, his failure to work with councils to deal with the reductions in their funding risks undermining the cleanliness that makes us proud to live in our communities. 'This is worsened by the fact that his cuts have been unfairly distributed, with leafy Elmbridge in Surrey seeing an increase in spending power over this Parliament while less wealthy communities – urban and rural – have been hit far harder. 'Labour would devolve power and money to local areas and work with them to find savings through collaboration, allowing them to protect the frontline services residents expect and rely on.' The biggest budget cuts have been seen in the North West, where spending on pest control is down 25 per cent, and the South East, by 24 per cent. The West Midlands, by contrast, has all but maintained spending, with only a two per cent cut since 2010. David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: 'Any reduction in pest control budgets is potentially going to result in more people attempting DIY solutions. Reports this year suggest that rats in the UK are becoming bigger, and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of pest control . 'The big issue around DIY pest control is the pitfalls of untrained people applying pesticides that could potentially cause harm to themselves, neighbours, or, more likely, non-target animals such as domestic pets or other wildlife that may visit a garden where someone is trying to control rats without a full understanding of the repercussions or effects that anticoagulant rodenticides can have further down the food chain. East Midlands 16% . East of England 23% . London 21% . North East 15% . North West 25% . South East 24% . South West 16% . West Midlands 2% . Yorkshire and Humber 23% . 'It is also key to remember that pests are a symptom of a particular environment - while the rats are the obvious problem, they may only be present in a certain area because of issues around fly-tipping or less apparent problems such as drainage defects. The amateur user of a pesticide will probably not understand this, may fail to find the root cause of the problem and may therefore fail to gain control quickly and sustainably - in other words reacting to the rats, rather than taking a more proactive and long term approach to the wider issue.' Communities Minister Brandon Lewis rejected Labour's criticism. He said: 'Under Labour, council tax doubled and bin collections halved. As minister for DEFRA, Hilary Benn was the Labour architect of bin cuts, bin fines and bin taxes - the Torquemada to Labour’s town hall Binquisition. 'Conservatives in Government are supporting weekly collections and abolished Labour's plans for bin taxes which would have see fly-tipping soar. 'Councils need to make savings to help pay off Labour's deficit, but they should do so by protecting frontline services and more joint working, better procurement and cutting waste. By contrast, the Labour Government in Wales now wants councils to empty bins monthly. Labour aren't friends of the Earth, they're friends of the rats.'","Council pest control budgets fall by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010 .

"Labour will reduce Britain to an economic basket case like France if it wins the election, a leading investment bank warned last night. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said it would lead to lower growth, and seriously damage investor confidence in the UK. In a devastating assessment, the world’s fourth-largest investment bank told clients that under a weak Ed Miliband government, possibly propped up by the SNP and Greens, the UK would ‘look increasingly like France’, where growth is almost non-existent and unemployment is almost double the level in the UK. Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured would turn the UK into an economic basket-case like France . Bank of America Mrrill Lynch warned that a Miliband premiership would likely be weak . The report said: ‘A Left-wing coalition around Labour, would, in our view, continue to deliver on fiscal austerity, albeit a milder version than the Tories, with the accompanying cyclical headwind that this entails, while embarking on structural changes which could in the medium run reduce the appeal of the UK as a business location and trigger, ultimately, a deterioration in potential GDP growth. ‘In a nutshell, the UK would look increasingly like France.’ The warning is acutely embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who cosied up to France’s socialist President Francois Hollande after his 2012 victory. At the time, Mr Miliband said the two men were ‘in agreement’ on the economy, and suggested he was looking to replicate the French anti-austerity programme. But Mr Hollande’s socialist experiment, which included a 75 per cent top tax rate, has proved a disaster. Economic growth in the final quarter was 0.1 per cent in France, compared with 0.5 per cent in the UK. Unemployment is 9.9 per cent – way above the 5.8 per cent in the UK. The BAML report warned that Mr Miliband is likely to ‘seriously interfere with the private sector’, adding that, with the public finances still in a mess, Labour may revert to bashing business in order to fund its pledges. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the report showed the danger posed by the Labour Party . ‘If a centre-Left government cannot tackle inequality through social transfers, it will be tempted to focus on fighting “primary inequality”, for instance by imposing a massive increase in the minimum wage,’ said the report. ‘In our estimates, Labour’s pledge to bring this to £8 per hour would put the UK at the level where France is, in terms of distance from the median wage. ‘Re-regulation of working contracts and working time would also be likely. The “energy price freeze” – mooted by Labour last year – and the proposals to introduce a market share cap in the banking sector are other examples of interference with the private sector.’ Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said the report underlined the threat posed by Labour. ‘Labour have no plan for the economy, other than more spending, more borrowing and more taxes,’ he said. ‘The choice is clear – between a competent Conservative government working through its long-term economic plan and the chaos of Labour with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.’","Labour would turn Britain into an economic basket case like France .

"Argentina's president has been formally accused of covering up Iran's involvement in a 1994 bombing at a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires.

Accused: Argentina's president Cristina Kirchner has been accused of covering up Iran's role in a deadly bombing in Buenos Aires in 1994 . Fatal: 85 people died in the explosion at a Jewish centre in Argentina's capital city on July 18, 1994 . The 61-year-old has used her Facebook page to deny the allegations and urge her citizens to look at the positives in Argentina. She wrote: 'You know what? Let’s forget about the hatred, the pain, the insults, the false accusations. 'We have the AUH [an education loan for children of low-income families], pensions, same-sex marriage, more and more human rights, the highest minimum wage in history, nationalized industries, investments in infrastructure, education, universities, scientists, schools and children.' President Kirchner has been under fire since Nisman was found dead in his Buenos Aires apartment on January 18. He accused her of protecting high-ranking Iranian officials from the deadly bombing which left 85 people dead in exchange for oil. The case's new prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita accepted the deceased Nisman's conclusions. He also accused Kirchner, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and other government officials of mounting a cover-up and violating their duties, according to a prosecution statement. He said in a 61-page document: 'An investigation will be initiated with an eye toward substantiating ... the accusations and whether those responsible can be held criminally responsible.' Mr Pollicita will present his finding to judge Daniel Rafecas - the federal magistrate assigned to the case - who will ultimately decide whether to dismiss it or send it on to trial. Nisman, 51, was found in his Buenos Aires apartment with a gunshot wound to the head on January 18. Mysterious: The case's prosecutor Alberto Nisman - who accused the government of secret deals with Iran - died one day before he was due to answer questions in congress . It is still not known if he was murdered or not. His death at the age of 51 was initially labelled a suicide but suspicion has since landed on Kirchner's government. The president has suggested he was manipulated by disgruntled former intelligence agents who killed him to smear her name. She branded Nisman's accusation that she conspired to whitewash his investigation 'absurd.' With eight months to go before Argentina's presidential election, the Nisman scandal has rocked Kirchner's credibility. She is constitutionally barred from running for a third term in office.","The investigation will go ahead even though prosecutor died on January 18 .

"Holidaymakers buying foreign currency at UK airports are being ‘ripped off’ by ‘terrible’ rates of exchange, experts warn. The pound is now worth around 1.35 euros on financial markets – its strongest level for seven years – giving British families more ‘bang for their buck’ on the Continent. But many are losing out by buying euros at airports across the country where tourist rates are among the worst on offer. The pound is now worth around 1.35 euros on financial markets – its strongest level for seven years – giving British families more ‘bang for their buck’ on the Continent . The Moneycorp Bureau de Change at Bristol Airport was yesterday offering customers just 1.06 euros per pound. Experts said families heading to the Continent for half-term can get far better deals if they buy their euros online. ‘It is a rip-off exchanging money at the airport,’ said James Daley, of consumer website Fairer Finance. On average customers get 1.16 euros for every pound they exchange at airports in the UK, specialists No1 Currency found. That compares with an average rate of 1.26 euros per pound on the high street and 1.30 online. It means swapping £500 at an airport would typically get 580 euros compared with 630 euros on the high street and 650 online. Simon Phillips of No1 Currency said: ‘The rates offered by money exchanges at the airports are terrible, targeting travellers who have no option. The clear message is to plan ahead and order online.’ Families are losing out by buying euros at airports across the country where tourist rates are among the worst on offer (file picture) The research also found huge regional variations. Travelex was yesterday offering just 1.1757 euros per pound at East Midlands Airport, 1.1888 at Manchester Airport, and 1.2078 at Heathrow. However, customers ordering online at Travelex.co.uk were offered 1.3139 per pound – and could still collect their holiday money from the airport if ordering at least four hours in advance. Mr Daley said: ‘The thing that will really make people kick themselves is that you can get a much better rate buying online and collecting your money from the airport. ‘Just about the worst thing you can do is change your pounds at the airport. You will get just about the worst rate going. Elvin Eldić, of Travelex, said: ‘The stores we operate at airports offer our customers a premium service open from the first to last flight, 365 days a year. The cost of doing business in airports does incur higher operational costs.’","Pound is worth  1.35 euros on financial markets-  the strongest in 7 years .

"All those who have been wondering what effect the legalization of same-marriage marriage has had on Alabama now have their answer, and all thanks to self-proclaimed 'redneck news reporter' Jeremy Todd Addaway. On Monday, Addaway posted a hilarious video on his Facebook page shot on his property near Red Hill, Alabama, in which he tries – and fails - to find evidence that gay marriage is destroying Blount County. The video, which clocks in at under 2 minutes, begins with Mr Addaway dressed in a camouflage sweatshirt filing a report from the field on the state of his county in the aftermath of a federal court ruling allowing same-sex couples to get marriage licenses. Not your average 'redneck': Self-proclaimed 'redneck news reporter' Jeremy Todd Addaway has made a funny video in which he tries – and fails - to find evidence that gay marriage is destroying Blount County, Alabama . No same-sex couples here! As a way to prove that nothing has changed in his home state in the aftermath of the court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Addaway showed viewers a pile of branches (left) and his shed (right), where he said there were no homosexuals to be found . ‘I read on the news today some information that homosexuals will be getting married in the State of Alabama today, and I wanted to give you a live report from Blount County,’ the intrepid correspondent says into the camera. Addaway's cell phone camera then pans over to a heap of tree branches lying on the ground in his yard. 'This pile of brush is still here, and there are no homosexuals laying on top of it, doing homosexual things,' Addaway deadpans. He then walks over to a cluttered outbuilding, peers inside and says: 'none in the shed either, but we've got to check into this further.' After checking on his 'pile of junk' to make sure it has not been taken over by homosexuals, Addaway concludes that the residents of Blount County are safe. Average Joe: The beer-loving, cigar-smoking Alabaman has become somewhat of an Internet phenomenon since posting the video of his Facebook page . Hunter and gatherer: Despite his penchant for camo clothing and his passion for hunting, Addaway has described himself as a liberal guy . 'We're not gonna be subjected to any kind of plagues of homosexuals falling from the sky,' he says. But Addaway cautions his audience that he did see a couple of squirrels that looked 'kinda suspect.' 'So we should look into that further ‘cause it may be spreading into the squirrel population,’ he quips. As of Friday evening, Addaway’s satirical video has been viewed more than 766,000 times and shared 13,225 times on Facebook. In a follow-up interview with local blogger Josh Phillips, Addaway explained that as a 'liberal type of guy,' he decided to make the video after witnessing a lot of 'backward things' in his home state. ‘Our county is dry and people around here are living in the past,’ he said in the interview. ‘My goal with this video is to show people that the sky is not falling because gay marriage is now legal. ‘No one is going to wake up gay, I woke up this morning straight as ever. Everyone is getting too wound up about it.’ After initial panic sparked by the legalization of same-sex marriage, most counties in Alabama sided with federal courts rather than their own chief justice, a Republican who once called homosexuality an inherent evil. US District Judge Callie Granade issued a strongly worded order Thursday saying that a judge could no longer deny marriage licenses to gays and lesbians, reiterating her ruling striking down the state's ban on same-sex marriage. Progress: Officials in 16 Alabama counties began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples February 13, a day after a federal judge ordered a local official to issue the licenses in accordance with an earlier ruling . Trailblazers: Angela Channell, right, and Dawn Hicks, left, celebrate with a kiss after receiving their marriage license on Friday. They were the first couple to apply for and receive a marriage license from Tuscaloosa County for a same sex marriage . Sealed with kisses: Kim Gebauer, left, and Regina Gebauer both of Daphne, Alabama, get married in a double wedding with Peggy Belcher, second from right, and her partner Louise Lynn, at Government Plaza in Mobile . 'These numbers represent a seismic shift in favor of equality and justice. Resistance to happy, loving and committed same-sex couples getting married is quickly crumbling throughout the state,' said Fred Sainz, a top spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, which has been lobbying to expand gay rights nationwide. ranade's ruling enabling gays to get licenses went into effect Monday after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene. But even then, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore said county judges were not bound by her decision. 'It's my duty to speak up when I see the jurisdiction of our courts being intruded by unlawful federal authority,' Moore insisted in an interview with The Associated Press later Monday. About 20 of Alabama's counties allowed gays and lesbians to wed on Monday. By Friday that number had jumped to at least 47, the Human Rights Campaign said. Other counties said they would revisit the decision next week. Granade's ruling made Alabama the 37th state where gays and lesbians can legally wed. While many Republican politicians in Alabama criticized her ruling last month and tried to link her to Obama administration policies, Granade was appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush. Arc of history: After initial panic sparked by the legalization of same-sex marriage, most counties in Alabama sided with federal courts rather than their own chief justice who once called homosexuality an inherent evil . Granade could have stayed her decision pending a final U.S. Supreme Court ruling, as federal judges in Mississippi and Arkansas did. Instead, she rejected Alabama's argument that keeping gays and lesbians from marrying benefits the state's children. And after Moore urged judges this week to ignore her ruling, she reiterated that they are bound by the U.S. Constitution to treat all couples equally. Moore's stand against federal authority surprised no one in Alabama, where the 68-year-old jurist who twice ran for governor burnished his conservative image a decade ago with a losing fight to keep his Ten Commandments statue inside the Alabama Judicial Building. While Moore again appeared on the losing side Friday, a longtime supporter said the 81 percent of Alabama voters who chose to ban gay marriage in 2006 would appreciate his stand. 'I think this lady judge is scaring the daylights out of these people,' Orange Beach businessman Dean Young said. 'The people are very thankful that Judge Moore is standing up.'","Jeremy Todd Addaway's video shows him reporting on the state of his county in the aftermath of the same-sex court ruling .

"Canadian police have foiled a deadly plot that would have seen at least two people storm a mall and kill as many victims as possible on Valentine's Day before committing suicide, officials have said. A 23-year-old US woman, from Geneva, Illinois, a 20-year-old man, from Halifax, and a 17-year-old boy, from Cole Harbour, were reportedly arrested  on Friday morning following a tip-off to police. Another man, a 19-year-old Canadian, shot himself at his parents' home in Timberlea earlier that day after officers surrounded the property, police said. The suspects are yet to be identified. In a statement, Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commanding Officer Brian Brennan said the deceased man and woman had intended to carry out the murderous plot at a Halifax mall.

Cordoned off: The teenager reportedly shot himself at his parents' home  after officers surrounded the house . Statement: Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commanding Officer Brian Brennan (pictured) said the deceased man and a 23-year-old woman had intended to carry out the murderous plot at a Halifax mall . They had plotted 'to go to a public venue in the Halifax region on February 14th with a goal of opening fire to kill citizens, and then themselves,' he told CBC News on Friday night. According to an anonymous senior police official, the pair had been communicating on a chat stream, were obsessed with killing and death and had numerous photos of mass killings. The alleged roles of the other male suspects are still being determined as part of the investigation. Officer Brennan said the force had received a tip-off about the woman and the 19-year-old man - who posed a 'potential significant weapons-related threat' - from the public on Thursday morning. Police quickly tracked the teenager down to Tiger Maple Drive in Timberlea and surrounded his parents' house. After the man realized he had been cornered, he allegedly shot himself dead. Photos posted on Twitter show armed police crouching in the snow outside the home in the early hours of Friday. Officers reportedly later determined two others were involved in the murder plot.

At around 2am on Friday, police arrested the 20-year-old man and the woman at Halifax Stanfield International Airport. The pair had been due to meet there ahead of the killings, officials said. According to the anonymous official, the woman had earlier tweeted a number of pronouncements that she wished to be posted after her death. The contents of these tweets remain unknown. At about 11am, police arrested the final suspect, the 17-year-old boy, in Cole Harbour. Speaking on Friday night, RCMP Sargent Alain LeBlanc said the plot to kill a large number of people at the mall - which has not been named - is not believed to be related to Islamic terrorism. Officer Brennan also said he wouldn't classify the plan as a 'terrorist event'. Instead, he said the four alleged plotters 'had some beliefs and were willing to carry out violent acts against citizens'. Emergency response: According to the anonymous official, the woman had earlier tweeted a number of pronouncements that she wished to be posted after her death. The contents of these tweets remain unknown . Police at the scene on Friday morning: Officer Brunner said the plot was 'not culturally-based', adding: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there' Scene: The Timberlea home where the 19-year-old reportedly shot himself is seen in the early hours of Friday . He added that the plot was 'not culturally-based', saying: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there.' Speaking to AP, a senior government official confirmed the plot was not terror related. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Police have released no details about the motive. During a press conference on Friday night, Officer Brennan declined to release the exact location of where the four allegedly plotted to attack. 'We believe we have apprehended all known individuals in this matter and have eliminated the threat. We are not seeking any further suspects at this time in relation to this investigation,' he said. On Friday, Mike Savage, mayor of Halifax, applauded the work of police in Canada, describing the arrests as 'a great example of the fine work they do on a daily basis to help keep Canadians safe.' 'We have among the best emergency response in the country,' he told CBC News. 'The good news is they discovered all this and dealt with it very effectively. We always have to be vigilant.'

"Obese people could be forced to get help for their ‘treatable’ condition or have their benefits cut, David Cameron will announce today. He also wants drug and alcohol addicts on welfare to be made to have treatment so they can get a job. The proposed overhaul of the benefits system could save Britain £500million a year in sickness payments. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to pull the plug on benefits for obese people or those with other treatable conditions such as alcoholism or drug addiction in a bid to save £500million-a-year in welfare . Christina Briggs, pictured, claimed that she needed additional help from the taxpayer to lose weight . The Prime Minister, who has asked a government health adviser to ‘rapidly’ review the Conservatives’ plans, will claim it is wrong that people are allowed to languish on welfare as a result of their lifestyle ‘choice’. ‘Too many people are stuck on sickness benefits because of issues that could be addressed but instead are not,’ he will say. ‘Some have drug or alcohol problems but refuse treatment. In other cases, people have problems with their weight that could be addressed – but instead a life on benefits rather than work becomes the choice. It is not fair to ask hard-working taxpayers to fund the benefits of people who refuse to accept the support and treatment that could help them get back to a life of work.’ Under one plan being looked at by the party, almost 2,000 people registered as long-term sick because of obesity would face having their benefits docked unless they agreed to lose weight. Around 56,000 people on the register say their primary condition is alcoholism. Almost 34,000 cite drug dependency. On average these 90,000 people get about £100 a week in sickness benefits and are entitled to other payments, such as housing and council tax benefits. They are already offered treatment, such as courses and medication, to kick their habit and get back to work. But there is no legal requirement to accept the help. Dame Carol Black, chairman of the Nuffield Trust and an adviser to the Department of Health, will now examine whether ‘incentives’ are needed.The proposals are likely to anger disability campaigners, who claim government efforts to get the long-term sick back to work have already gone too far. Dame Carol Black, pictured, will now examine whether 'incentives' are needed to push through the plan . But Dame Carol says: ‘I am deeply interested in trying to overcome the challenges these types of benefit claimants pose. ‘These people, in addition to their long-term conditions and lifestyle issues, suffer the great disadvantage of not being engaged in the world of work – such an important feature of society.’ Mr Cameron will say that the next Conservative government is determined to ensure ‘that the hardest to help’ receive the support they need to improve their lives. ‘That is why I have asked Professor Dame Carol Black to undertake a rapid review into how best to support those suffering from long-term yet treatable conditions back into work.’","The obese, drunks and drug addicts will have to seek help or lose benefits .

"Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio (pictured with his wife Ana) is set to collect a £7million bonus on top of his £4million salary . The Chancellor faces a row over fat cat pay ahead of the general election as the boss of Lloyds prepares to collect a £7million bonus. The state-backed lender is expected to rush out details of the bumper shares windfall for chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio when it publishes its annual results on February 27. It usually publishes senior executives’ pay in its annual report in March, but is hoping to avoid a drip-feed of negative publicity. The shares bonus – almost 50 times David Cameron’s £142,500 salary – stems from a performance-related award given to Mr Horta Osorio shortly after he took the helm in 2011, which was signed off by the Treasury. It comes on top of a pay package worth up to £4million, putting the 51-year-old Portuguese chief on course to rake in £11million. However last night MPs said the size of the payout would ‘stick in the throat’ of taxpayers. Labour’s shadow Treasury secretary Chris Leslie said: ‘I can’t help but feel uncomfortable about the sheer scale of these rewards in a bank backed by taxpayers. ‘Until Lloyds is standing on its own two feet, I don’t think it should be lavishing its managers with so much money. The job is still only partially done.’ Lloyds has defended the award, pointing out that Mr Horta Osorio has hit strict performance targets – which include returning the bank to profit. The bank’s share price has also rocketed from 26p in 2011 to more than 75p, and taxpayers’ stake in the lender has reduced from 40 per cent to 25 per cent. But Labour’s plea for restraint was echoed last night by Conservative MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the influential Treasury Committee. ‘I consider myself to be a red-blooded capitalist,’ he said. ‘But this is such an unimaginable amount of money to 99 per cent of the world’s population that it does slightly stick in the throat.’ Chancellor George Osborne is desperate to avoid a row over pay at Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland ahead of the general election. For the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, both lenders are expected to post an annual profit when they announce their results for 2014. Lloyds is expected to post profits of more than £2billion. Lloyds is expected to rush out details of the bumper shares windfall for Mr Horta Osorio when it publishes its annual results this month . This will be used to support Mr Osborne’s claims that the two bailed-out lenders have been nursed back to health under his watch. However a £7million windfall for Mr Horta Osorio will be seized on by Labour as evidence that the Government has not managed to rein in the banks’ excesses. Mr Horta Osorio is thought to be determined to collect his bonus. But Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, joined calls for him to wait. ‘While by all accounts Mr Horta Osorio has done a good job, the bank needs to show serious restraint until it’s back in the private sector,’ he said. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We’ve consistently said that rewards at Lloyds need to be linked to improving its performance and the taxpayer getting its money back. We’ve ensured that the chief executive’s remuneration is linked to strict targets on these points.’","Lloyds chief executive is preparing to collect a £7million bonus .

The more the listener enjoyed what they were hearing, the stronger the connections were. 'When people listen to a piece of music they have never heard before, activity in one brain region can reliably and consistently predict whether they will like or buy it,' said researcher Valorie Salimpoor of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. 'This is the nucleus accumbens which is involved in forming expectations that may be rewarding.' Previous research has found that listening to new music can boost the brain and give it a chemical 'reward' similar to sex .","Spotify studied 28 million ‘love’ playlists and  2.5 million ‘sex' playlists .

"Manchester United striker Robin van Persie was pulled over by police on Thursday morning while on his way to the club's training ground. The Dutchman, who scored in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League win against Burnley on Wednesday night, was stopped in his Range Rover as he made his way to the Premier League side's Aon Training Complex.

"Queen of Shops star Mary Portas revealed last night that the genetic father of her young son is in fact her brother. Miss Portas and her civil partner Melanie Rickey had previously kept their sperm donor's identity anonymous. Miss Rickey, 42, gave birth to the couple's first child in 2012 following IVF treatment. They had desperately wanted Miss Portas, 54, to also have a genetic link to their child. Miss Portas revealed the extraordinary circumstances behind the birth of her son Horatio in a newspaper interview to promote her memoir, Shop Girl. Scroll down for video . Queen of Shops star Mary Portas with her civil partner Melanie Rickey and their child Horatio, whose father is Miss Portas' younger brother . She revealed that she had asked for help from her younger brother, Lawrence Newton, who said he would be 'honoured' to assist. Miss Rickey subequently became pregnant on her second round of IVF. Miss Portas said she informed Mr Newton of Horatio's birth via text. The couple's son, now two, calls Miss Portas 'Mama' and Miss Rickey 'Mummy'. Mr Newton is referred to as 'Daddy'. Miss Portas told The Times of Horatio's birth: 'Lawrence was the first one there [with us] and he picked him up and it was just very emotional. He and I walked out into the sunshine holding him. I remember we were round the back of the hospital and I said to him 'thank you!' and he said, 'It's my pleasure', and we just held each other. 'That was it, you know? It's amazing. And now, when I look at Horatio, he is a complete mix of [Mel] and me.' Miss Portas and her partner Melanie Rickey had previously kept their sperm donor's identity anonymous . She added: 'Of course, now I know that it could only ever have been Lawrence who was Horatio's father.' Miss Portas – who had only told close family and friends about Horatio's genetic father – is one of a growing number of women in same-sex relationships who have asked siblings to assist with fertility treatments. The star of Mary Queen of Shops said of Horatio: 'He is extraordinarily charming, so full of life. He's slept since he was five months old. He loves kicking a ball, he loves puzzles, music – I think because there is so much joy and easiness around him. We are all calmer … but we still get that thing at 6.30am when he shouts out 'Mama! Mama!'.' Mr Newton, 52, who has no wish for a family of his own, is living with his sister, her partner and their son for three months before he emigrates to Bermuda to be with his girlfriend. Miss Portas has two elder children – Mylo, 21, and Verity, 18 – with her ex-husband Graham Portas, a chemical engineer. The couple split in 2003 before Miss Portas met Miss Rickey at a dinner held at the Royal College of Art. The couple entered into a civil partnership in 2010. She shot to fame with her TV series Mary Queen of Shops, pictured with her clothing range . Miss Portas started out in 1989 as a shop window-dresser at London department store Harvey Nicholls, rising to become creative designer with a seat on the board. She came to fame with her TV series Mary Queen of Shops, which ran from 2007 until 2010. She and Mr Newton are the youngest of five children. Their mother died when the siblings were mere teenagers; on Desert Island Discs in 2010, she told how she looked after Mr Newton by visiting the local butcher and asking what her mother would have bought. Miss Portas, who also runs a communications agency and a string of charity shops, admitted that Miss Rickey wants another child – but said she does not have the energy to raise one. 'God, I couldn't have another one!' she said. 'I'm tired. I also like balance in my life.' Fertility expert Simon Fishel said the increase in same-sex relationships had led to more instances of sibling donations. He told The Times: 'It would have been more unusual ten years ago. Now that kind of situation pops up once a month. 'If they can go for a family donor, that will be preferable and then it would be to a known donor. There's a very close relationship. You know where the genes are coming from. They are trying to keep it in the family.' The couple converted their civil partnership into a marriage at Westminster City Hall in 2014 .","Mary Portas, 54, revealed genetic father of  son Horatio, two, is her brother .

"The Church of England is expected to advise Christians to vote for parties that are in favour of scrapping Britain's nuclear deterrent, file photo . The Church of England is preparing to publish an extraordinary document advising Christians on voting in the general election. The document – which will provoke yet another row with the Government – suggests Trident should be scrapped, proposes more EU integration and questions parts of the Coalition’s austerity programme. It claims to offer advice for the country’s 30million Christians on how to ‘approach the general election’ in May. Billed as a ‘letter from the Church of England’s House of Bishops’, it is ‘addressed to all members of the Church’. Last night Conservative MPs said the ‘manifesto’ was littered with errors and questioned the wisdom of the Church intervening in the political debate so close to an election. The bishops insist it is ‘not a shopping list of policies we would like to see, it is a call for the new direction that we believe our political life ought to take’. But it goes on to offer commentary on a string of political issues. One of the most controversial sections is on Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Trident, which the Tories say they want to retain but others, including the resurgent Scottish Nationalists, want scrapped. The document says: ‘The sheer scale of indiscriminate destructive power represented by nuclear weapons such as Trident was only justifiable, if at all, by appeal to the principle of mutually assured destruction. Shifts in the global strategic realities mean that the traditional arguments for nuclear deterrence need re-examining.’ The document will also propose more European integration. ‘After the Second World War, the nations of Europe sought to rebuild for prosperity through a shared determination that never again would global neighbours resort to mass slaughter,’ it says. ‘English churchmen worked tirelessly to promote understanding and cooperation … That history is not an argument for the structures and institutions of the EU as they now exist. But it is an enduring argument for continuing to build structures of trust and cooperation between the nations of Europe.’ The Church is also expected to recommend even closer integration within the European Union, file photo . Conservative MP Conor Burns, pictured, criticised the Church's intervention in the election campaign . On the economy, the Church says unemployment ‘has not risen as high as was predicted’. In fact, it has not risen under the Coalition, falling by 596,000 since 2010, with 1.75million more people entering work. The document also says Britain has ‘seen the burgeoning of in-work poverty’ – another questionable claim, since the latest figures show that the proportion of people in in-work poverty is the same as in 2010. The document claims that ‘the greatest burdens of austerity have not been born [sic] by those with the broadest shoulders’. But the Treasury has published figures suggesting that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction. The document does praise some government policies including its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product on foreign aid as a way to mitigate ‘grotesque inequalities of wealth and power’ between rich and poor countries. Conservative MP Conor Burns said: ‘It is deeply disturbing that the Church appears to be entering the political arena based on a series of clear misrepresentations of facts. ‘The call to abandon our nuclear defence in increasingly uncertain times and for more EU integration with no consultation of the British public will rightly cause concern.’","The Church is preparing a document to advise its flock how to vote .

"The British sons of Guantanamo Bay detainee Shaker Aamer pleaded for his release yesterday – as his supporters marked the 13-year anniversary of his detention. In their first interview, Mr Aamer’s young sons told how their hopes for their father’s freedom had been raised and dashed during years of delays in which he has twice been cleared for release. The father-of-four has been held without charge in the notorious US-run detention camp for exactly 13 years today. Scroll down for video . The British sons of Guantanamo Bay detainee Shaker Aamer pleaded for his release yesterday. Pictured, Mr Aamer with his son Michael (right) and daughter Johninh . Shaker Aamer's young son Faris and Michael spoke of their hopes their father would be released from Guantanamo Bay soon . His youngest son Faris was born on the day Mr Aamer arrived at Guantanamo and has never met his father, whose case was raised by Prime Minister David Cameron during White House talks with Barack Obama last month. President Obama promised to treat it as a priority but Faris will today mark his 13th birthday without his father at his side. He told Sky News: ‘It’s upsetting and quite shocking that I’ve never met him in my entire life.’ His older brother Michael, 15, said the family had hoped their ordeal was over when Mr Aamer was cleared for release, first by the Bush administration in 2007 and then by Mr Obama in 2009. Michael said: ‘We thought there might be a chance for him to come home, but it just kept getting delayed. ‘We just felt more sad because nothing happened. We’ve seen other people with their parents… seen how they enjoy themselves, how they’re so close to them. ‘It’s like there is a part of our heart that is missing because we’ve been yearning for him to come home for many years and nothing’s happened yet.’ Mr Aamer has now been held at Guantanamo for 13 years without justice . Human rights campaigners Amnesty International have branded Mr Aamer’s 13-year detention without charge or trial as ‘disgraceful and inexcusable’. Its chief executive Kate Allen said: ‘We keep being told that Shaker’s case is being “raised” or “prioritised”, but he’s still sitting in a cell in Cuba, 5,000 miles away from his family back here in Britain. ‘It’s abundantly clear that the US long ago gave up any pretence of bringing Shaker to justice. They must stop toying with this man’s life and put him on the first plane back to London.’ Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and his wife and their four children are British citizens. In 2001, he was detained in Afghanistan and he claims he was tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison before he was sent to Guantanamo in February 2002. Campaigners say he has been held in solitary confinement for long periods and that his mental and physical health have deteriorated, and that he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The US authorities say he is a terrorist with links to Al Qaeda but Mr Aamer has insisted he travelled to Afghanistan ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks to work for a humanitarian charity. Guantanamo spokesman Lt Col Myles Caggins said: ‘In 2009 Shaker Aamer’s detention status was reviewed. As a result he was placed in a category we call “eligible for transfer”. ‘At some point in the future we will find a new home for him to be repatriated or resettled to. ‘We make these moves after a rigorous inter-agency process between our security officials, law enforcement and intelligence officials to ensure that transfer will be to a place that can maintain security assurances and human rights protections for those former Guantanamo detainees.’ Mr Aamer’s son Michael said: ‘I feel very sad because the man [Lt Col Caggins] said they were going to try to find him a home. But his home is here in London with his family.’ In recent years, the family have been able to communicate with Mr Aamer via Skype calls organised by the Red Cross. His supporters, including Pink Floyd musician Roger Waters, took a giant Valentine’s card to the US Embassy in London to protest against his ongoing detention. The card read ‘Please tell the President we want Shaker returned to his loved ones in London now’, and was signed by supporters including MPs, human rights campaigners and celebrities. The US administration has said it is ‘aggressively pursuing’ the transfer of the remaining 122 Guantanamo inmates. But the US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, who must give the final authority to transfer any of the men, has confirmed Mr Aamer’s file has not crossed his desk.","Shaker Aamer has now been held in Guantanamo Bay for exactly 13 years .

"When Ashante Fowlkes suddenly stopped breathing Wednesday night in her Detroit home, her husband called 911 hoping to get help for his wife. Instead, Jerome Fowlkes says the dispatcher who answered his call was rude to him and eventually hung up without sending over an ambulance. Mr Fowlkes, a married father of three, also stated that the emergency operator accused him of trying to pull a prank on her, but that claim has been disputed.

The incident took place Wednesday night when Ashante Fowlkes, who suffers from blood clots in her lungs, collapsed and stopped breathing. Mr Fowlkes instructed his son, Deonte, to call 911 while he went to work trying to revive his unconscious wife. ‘I grabbed the phone from him. [I was] trying to ask them how to do CPR and the operator said “this is a prank. I'm terminating the call,""’ Fowlkes told MyFox Chicago. The frantic husband then had his daughter, Da’Jana, call 911 again, and this time another operator said she will be sending an ambulance over. But the family decided not to wait any longer and took Ashante Fowlkes to the hospital themselves.

"Philip Johnson sees no significance in Valentine's Day. The dedicated husband, who moved into an aged-care facility in Sydney to be with his beloved wife of nearly 63 years, says February 14 'is just another day'. The 88-year-old cherishes every single moment he's able to spend with Eileen, 86, who only has limited speech after suffering a stroke five years ago. Consequently Mrs Johnson is physically weak and needs full-time care. But whether it be in sickness or in health, her husband - who does not require care himself - patiently sits with her by the window every day and holds her hand every chance he gets. Philip and Eileen Johnson, 88 and 86, who have been married for almost 63 years . Mr Johnson first met his future wife when he was 18-years-old. They are pictured together on their first date . The couple tied the knot on September 6, 1952 (right) and went on to have two daughters. Now they have three grandchildren . Philip Johnson was 18-years-old when he first met his future wife through a friend. His first thought when he saw her was: 'God she's a cracker.' But it was September 6, 1952 that Mr Johnson recalls as the best day of his life - the day he married Eileen. The pair moved from the UK to Australia when their daughters were 10 and six and settled down in Campbelltown, southwest Sydney. Mr and Mrs Johnson now have three grandchildren. Philip and Eileen Johnson's marriage appears to be quite similar along the lines of the hit movie The Notebook . In the movie (pictured) Noah spends most of his time with wife Allie, who suffers dementia, at a nursing home . Five years ago Mr Johnson, who worked as a sales rep for British–Dutch consumer company Unilever until he was 58, made the decision to sell his unit soon after his wife's stroke. Mrs Johnson had to be moved into the Whiddon Group Easton Park residential home in Glenfield, southwest Sydney, and a few months later Mr Johnson packed up his belongings and followed suit. Now his wife, who was once the personal assistant for a director at Grace Brothers - today known as Myer, is only able to repeat a phrase about American soldiers and say 'thank you'. Despite the severe impacts of her stroke, Mr Johnson is able to understand exactly what his wife tries to express. He says he can't explain it, he just knows. 'One of the impacts of Eileen's stroke was the effect on her speech, she can't speak so well anymore. I try to visualise what she means. Really, we just got on with life,' Mr Johnson said.

He was teary as he said: 'We have grown older but are still very much in love.' Mr Johnson will be gifting his wife 'the usual' flowers and chocolates on February 14 but this is no different from any other day.

"If a man in Maryland was self-employed as a bank robber he simply may have been including his child in take your son to work day or perhaps he just couldn't find a babysitter. Charles County authorities say that a man in his 30's or 40's accompanied by a boy between the ages of 10 and 13 attempted to rob a Sun Trust bank on Friday but may have decided to change their minds at the last minute. The older man handed a note to the bank teller which said something along the lines of 'give me all your money' and implied that he had a weapon. Not a piggy bank: This man accompanied by a child allegedly gave a bank teller a note demanding she give him all her money then left without saying a word . Before the bank teller could do anything to respond the threat, the man allegedly left with the boy without demanding any cash.

'Or he may have had a change of heart,' she said of the bizarre decision to leave a threatening note then walk away without stealing any money. Richardson said that witnesses were unsure as to whether the boy was aware of the robbery or if he was perhaps acting as a lookout for the older man. 'We don’t know if this young man knew if anything was going on,' Richardson said. Police has a surveillance video of the event but have not identified any suspects.

"A Texas man has been arrested for allegedly shooting dead his wife of three years as she was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. Tommy George Dooley, 51, was arrested outside his home in Granbury early Friday morning and charged with murder in the killing of his wife, 65-year-old LaVera Aiken Dooley. According to Hood County Sheriff's officials, at around 10pm Thursday they got a 911 call from Mrs Dooley, who told the operator she was afraid her husband was going to shoot her. Domestic drama: Tommy Dooley (left), 51, has been charged with murdering his wife of three years, 65-year-old LaVera Aiken Dooley (right) The bloody incident played out outside the Dooleys' home on Colonial Drive in Granbury, Texas . The dispatcher then heard the sound of multiple gunshots over the phone. Moments later, the woman's husband, Tommy Dooley, called police. Deputies who responded to the couple's home in the 6600 block of Colonian Drive in the gated community of Pecan Plantation discovered LaVera Dooley fatally shot inside her car, reported NBC DFW. Investigators say the victim sustained six gunshot wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene. According to sheriff's deputies, the woman was trying to back out of her driveway but was unable to flee because her husband's car was blocking her way. She called police from her locked vehicle, and that is when Tommy Dooley allegedly came outside and shot her through the car's windows. Mr Dooley is being held in jail on $500,000 bond. Premonition: The woman was shot six times inside her car while telling a 911 operator over the phone she thought her husband, an insurance broker (pictured), was going to shoot her . Both the husband and wife worked in the insurance business. The couple have grown children from past relationships. Just days earlier, Mrs Dooley posted on her Facebook page photos from her wedding, which took place in 2011. In the pictures, a beaming LaVera Aiken Dooley is seen in a black lace gown holding a bouquet of sunflowers, with her new husband standing by her side. According to local police, the newlyweds had a history of domestic disturbance calls.

"Heads bowed in terror the orange-clad Kurdish fighters are paraded through streets filled with jeering militants in the latest horrifying video release from Islamic State. In a grim echo of the terrible fate which befell Jordanian pilot Lieutenant Muath al-Kaseasbeh the captives, reportedly Peshmerga fighters, are dressed in orange jumpsuits and shackled in cages. Just as Lt. al-Kaseasbeh was burned alive on camera, IS are planning to do the same with their latest prisoners, according to posts on social media. Scroll down for video . A terrified Kurdish prisoner looks out from his cage at a mob of jeering militants in the horrific scene . Each prisoner was accompanied by black clad and flag waving jihadis, some armed with AK-47s . Onlookers jeered and taunted the prisoners as their captors played to the crowds during the procession . Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh is pictured about to be burned to death in a horrific film released by ISIS. There are fears the Kurdish prisoners in the latest release could meet the same dreadful fate . The grim procession apparently took place through Kirkuk in northwest Iraq, an oil rich Kurdish stronghold where ISIS now has a presence after mounting repeated attacks in recent weeks. The parade, reportedly through the Hawija district in the southwest of Kirkuk, could be seen as revenge for horrific reports of Kurdish forces dragging the bodies of ISIS fighters through the streets of the city in the Kurdistan region of Iraq earlier this month. In the nearly four minute long video 17 of the Iraqi Kurdistan military forces are driven one by one on the backs of white pick-up trucks with ISIS flag-waving militants toting AK-47s accompanying each prisoner. At the end of the clip the long line of cages can be seen retreating into the sunset over the heads of massed crowds of militants. A total of 17 Peshmerga were led through the streets of what is apparently Kirkuk in northwestern Iraq . Posts on social media suggested the Islamic State militants plan to set fire to the Kurdistan warriors . This captive stares grimly ahead as one militant records him on his smartphone as he is driven past . The parade reportedly took place in Hawija in southwest Kirkuk, where ISIS is now said to have a foothold . Lt. al-Kaseasbeh was filmed being burned to death by Islamic State extremists in a nightmarish 22-minute film which was expertly edited before being posted online. Titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', it showed the captured airman locked in a cage before a trail of petrol leading up to its bars is set alight. It is thought he was immolated while heavily sedated before debris, including broken masonry, is poured over the cage, which is then flattened by a bulldozer. Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the captured pilot. After the footage was released, Jordanian officials  executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS. They included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. Thousands of Jordanian troops have been deployed to the country's border with Iraq to stop Islamic State militants from infilatrating the country, it has been reported. The country has already carried out airstrikes on ISIS targets in revenge for the murder of their pilot. Iraqi security forces  killed eight ISIS assailants wearing Iraqi army uniforms during an attack against the Ain al-Asad air base, where 320 US Marines are currently training Iraqi troops . Al-Baghdadi is only nine miles away from the air base, where Iraqi officials had to call for reinforcements . The latest procession of captives scene played out against the backdrop of ISIS taking the town of Al-Baghdadi in western Iraq. The fall of the town, which the Pentagon played down as a minor setback, came as IS extremists launched an unsuccessful assault involving suicide bombers on the nearby Al-Asad air base. 'We do assess that right now they have control of Al-Baghdadi,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby told a news conference, adding IS took hold of the town 'in the past several days.' The town is located in Anbar province, about five miles (eight kilometers) from the Asad air base, where about 300 US Marines are stationed to assist Iraqi government troops. Iraqi soldiers repelled the IS group's assault on the base on Friday which involved several suicide bombers, officials said. A group of 20-25 IS fighters, most of them wearing Iraqi army uniforms, carried out the failed attack, which appeared designed to have been an initial wave of suicide bombings followed by gunmen storming in, Kirby said. All of the militants were killed or died when detonating suicide bombs. No US military serve members were under direct threat from the attack, as they were several miles away, but two Iraqi soldiers were killed and several were wounded . Kirby said that 'at no time were US troops anywhere near the fighting,' which was about two miles away from where the Americans were working at the sprawling complex. American surveillance aircraft tracking the IS extremists assisted the Iraqi army forces and Apache attack helicopters were sent in but did open fire, officials said. US-led coalition aircraft carried out five air strikes in the area over the past 24 hours, roughly 15 kilometers from the Asad base, but those were not related to the brief firefight with the IS militants at Asad, officials said. 'There were no aircraft involved in beating back this,' Kirby said. 'The Iraqi security forces did this on their own.' An Iraqi army colonel and a defense ministry official said the botched attack involved at least seven would-be suicide bombers using a military vehicle. Al-Baghdadi had been under growing pressure for months and was one of the few towns that had remained under the Iraqi government's control in the predominantly Sunni province. But the Pentagon said the capture of the town did not represent a major setback in the war effort against the Islamists who have overrun large areas of Iraq and Syria. 'This is arguably the first in at least a couple of months, if not more, where they (IS) have had any success at all at taking any new ground,' Kirby said. 'So this is an enemy that we still assess to be in a defensive posture.' He added: 'It's one town. It's not all of Anbar. It's not all of Iraq. 'We need to keep it in perspective.' US officials have said it will take some time before Iraqi troops are trained and ready to stage a major counter-offensive in Anbar province, where much of the Sunni population has become alienated from the Shiite-led leadership in Baghdad. Washington is pinning its hopes on Iraqi government plans to build up a militia among the Sunni tribes in the area against the IS jihadists. On Wednesday President Obama formally requested from Congress the authority to use military force in the war against ISIS. The proposal does not ask for the deployment of ground troops. During a press conference the president said: 'Our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive and ISIL is going to lose.'","Orange clad Peshmerga are driven through crowds of jeering militants .

"A Georgia police officer beat a pregnant woman so hard that she ended up having a miscarriage because he did not like the 'tone' she was speaking in, a new lawsuit has alleged. In the $50,000-plus suit, Kenya Harris, says she was called to Albany Police Department (APD) in West Oglethorpe Boulevard in May 2011 after her young son was arrested on unspecified charges. But after waiting for five hours, she informed officer Ryan Jenkins that she had other children to take care of at home and needed to leave. However, Jenkins reportedly reacted in a 'hostile' manner. Alleged beating: Georgia-based police officer Ryan Jenkins beat expectant mother Kenya Harris so hard at Albany Police Department (pictured) that she ended up having a miscarriage, a new lawsuit has alleged . He 'stated that he did not appreciate the tone in which she was communicating with him, and further stated that if she continued he would take her head and ""put it to the floor"",' the suit says. Shortly after, Harris  tried again to explain that she needed to leave - at which point, Jenkins followed through on his threat with the compliance of another officer, Richard Brown Jr, it is claimed. Jenkins reportedly grabbed the expectant mother by the neck, before 'slamming her to the ground', causing her to fall unconscious. When she woke up, Jenkins was sitting on her, the suit states. 'Defendant Officer Jenkins, without provocation, grabbed plaintiff, who weighs less than one hundred twenty (120) pounds, by her neck and slammed her to the ground,' it reads. Chief: The suit, filed in Federal Court on February 5, names Officer Richard Brown Jr and Albany Police Chief John Proctor (pictured) as well as Jenkins . 'Plaintiff momentarily blacked out and came to with defendant Officer Jenkins sitting on her back, and with his knee on her arm. Plaintiff was pregnant at the time.' Finally, the officer allegedly handcuffed Harris and threw her against the wall. Despite her pleas for medical attention, she was then transferred to Dougherty County Jail without being seen to by a doctor, it is said. There, she was held for the night on a charge of obstruction, according to the suit, which was obtained by Courthouse News Service. It is unknown what stage of pregnancy the alleged victim was at at the time. After making bail the next day, Harris traveled to Phoebe Convenient Care in Dawson Road, where she discovered she had suffered a miscarriage due to the beating, the suit states. She was also treated for 'severe physical' injuries, including a knee contusion, neck spasms, muscle pain and bruising to her body, the document, filed in Federal Court, claims. Now, Harris is suing Jenkins and Brown, as well as Police Chief John Proctor,  for the excessive force, assault, battery and emotional distress that she allegedly suffered at the department. In the suit, her lawyer, Nikki Bonner, of Bonner & Penn in Atlanta, claims less force 'should have been used' by Jenkins. If this had been the case, Harris would not have lost her baby, she says. Harris is seeking more than $50,000, as well as punitive damages. The suit was filed on February 5. However, city attorneys told Fox 31 that the city has not yet been served. APD added that neither of the officers named in the suit still works for the police force. On Friday evening, APD had not yet responded to a request for comment by DailyMail.com.","Kenya Harris is suing Officer Ryan Jenkins for alleged May 2011 beating .

"Bali Nine drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan could be executed within days after Australian embassy staff were called to meet with Indonesian diplomats on Monday. A spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed the meeting, saying other officials with nationals facing execution have also been summoned. This comes as family and friends say their final goodbyes to the Australians, including Sukumaran's mentor and artist Ben Quilty. Chan and Sukumaran are expected to be moved to Nusa Kambangan - a prison island off central Java - where prisoners on death row are executed. They will be given 72 hours notice of their execution by firing squad. The pair were leaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were found guilty of attempting to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin valued at about $4 million from Indonesia to Australia in 2005. Scroll down for video . Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran have been moved for execution . A general view shows the death island of Nusa Kambangan island, upon which Indonesia's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed . 'The Australian Embassy in Jakarta, along with a number of other diplomatic missions, has been invited to a meeting with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday,' a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. It is not yet known whether officials attending the meeting will be notified when the executions will take place. Those who are on death row are believed to be delaying the execution date as they have to be transported from prisons across Indonesia, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. In previous a case, embassies were informed just 24 hours before Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo held a media conference to announce when five prisoners on similar charges would face the firing squad. They were executed on January 18 - three days after Mr Prasetyo spoke to the press, the Sydney Morning Herald further reports. The Attorney-General said on Friday a date is yet to be set for the imminent executions and gave no indication to when the 72 hour notice period will commence. Chan and Sukumaran have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search. Mr Sukumaran is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in Kerobokan jail. The classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated . Sukumaran's friend and mentor, artist Ben Quilty, said goodbye to him at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday . During a charity event on Saturday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott made another appeal to Indonesian authorities. 'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia and my plea even at this late stage is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas,' he said. Artist Ben Quilty says Sukumaran is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad. Quilty said goodbye the 33-year-old to at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday. 'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said ""no"". He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio. The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting. Nusa Kambangan is deceiving, it's pristine waters and white sandy beaches look like a place of haven . Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are expected to be taken to Nusa Kambangan, where they will take their final breaths . The Australians who are facing execution were arrested at Bali's Denpasar airport and their case has taken on enormous resonance as a domestic political issue in Australia. Sukumaran has begun what may well be his final painting after finding a photo of the Indonesian island where he will likely be shot and killed. 'He's found an image of the island where his execution will take place and wants to make a painting. I hope it's not the last he makes but it's the beginnings of a great painting,' Quilty said. Sukumaran has been on death row for almost ten years but Quilty, who has been leading the Mercy Campaign for the Bali Nine pair, said on Thursday his spirits were high after Ms Bishop and Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek pleaded for their lives to be spared in parliament. Indonesian police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison Nusa Kambangan . But later in the day, events took a turn for the worse and their moods plummeted when it was confirmed permission had been granted to move them from Kerobokan prison, setting the wheels in motion for their death. 'By the afternoon things had gone dark, it was very bleak leaving them there,' Quilty said. 'We thought he'd be fine. I said one day we'd be sat on a veranda out in the bush smoking a pipe and drinking vodka together, now that looks like it will never happen.' Quilty explained yesterday was the first time Sukumaran let out a tear when he said goodbye to his friend. 'The inevitability of it is brutal. He handled it better than I did.' A meeting on Thursday granted permission to move the Bali Nine drug smugglers on a date which will be determined on Friday. Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids.

Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo, who hasn't shied away from commenting on the men's cases before the courts, says he won't delay with his execution plans. Chan and Sukumaran are expected to be moved to Nusakambangan, a prison island off central Java known as 'Indonesia's Alcatraz'. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that it understood officials have been speaking to airport authorities and Garuda - the national carrier - which has apparently agreed to fly the men to the place where the executions will take place. They will be given 72 hours notice of their execution by firing squad. Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail. Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free.

"Notorious murderer Kenny Noye (pictured) could walk free within weeks after being granted a parole hearing . The father of the young man murdered by gangster Kenneth Noye in a road rage attack reacted angrily yesterday after it emerged he could be freed from prison in weeks. Noye, now 67, was jailed for life in 2000 for the murder of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron in a road rage attack four years earlier. He used a 9in knife he kept in his car to stab Mr Cameron on a slip road of the M25 near Swanley, Kent, as the victim's 17-year-old fiancee, Danielle Cable, looked on in horror. The killing triggered an international hunt for Noye, who had already served 14 years in jail for his part in the Brink's-Mat bullion robbery in 1983. But now – just 15 years after he was locked up – he has been granted a parole hearing after officials said he was a model prisoner and should be considered for release. Stephen's father Ken Cameron insisted yesterday that Noye – who also killed a policeman in the 1980s but was cleared of murder – should never be let out of prison. At his home in East Anglia, Mr Cameron, 68, said: 'He left my son dying in the gutter and fled to Spain. I don't believe he has changed his ways. 'He'll always be a dangerous man. People will say anything when they are up for parole. Noye should never be allowed out of prison – he is an evil man and has never shown remorse.' He added: 'We still keep in touch with the detectives from the case. They tell me he comes across as the model prisoner but... I think he tells them what they want to hear.' Mr Cameron said there was a meeting between probation and police this week to discuss the case and Noye's parole hearing could be held as early as May. Noye is currently at Category C Wayland Prison in Norfolk. Mr Cameron said: 'We live in the same region as the prison. What I don't want is him being allowed out on shopping trips. I fear one of us could bump into him in the street.' Stephen Cameron, who was knifed to death by Noye during a road rage attack, is pictured with his girlfriend Danielle Cable . Mr Cameron's wife Toni, who is in her early 70s, said: 'We're disgusted. We don't think he should be allowed a hearing. Life should mean life. We have written a letter to the Home Secretary with our complaint.' Danielle Cable's father Jimmy, 57, said he will 'never forgive' Noye for what he did. His daughter was put in the witness protection programme, meaning he can see her and his granddaughter just twice a year. Speaking from his home in Orpington, Kent, he said: 'Why should they let him out? It has affected my family so much. I can't believe he could be released, it shouldn't happen.' At Noye's trial, he admitted that he had stabbed Stephen Cameron to death but insisted that he had acted in self-defence. However the jury convicted him of murder after a pathologist said Mr Cameron's injuries were consistent with murderous intent. Police at the scene of the M25 'road rage' killing of Stephen Cameron- Noye was later arrested in Spain following the 1996 murder . Noye had previously stabbed to death Detective Constable John Fordham in the grounds of his 20-acre mansion in West Kingsdown, Kent, in 1985. At the trial, he said he had acted in self-defence – and was dramatically cleared of murder. The following year, he was convicted of handling Brink's-Mat gold and jailed for 14 years. During the infamous robbery, six gunmen burst into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport and doused security guards in petrol before escaping with £26million. The Parole Board confirmed Noye's case had been referred to it, but added it 'can only direct the release of a life sentence prisoner if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for him to be detained in order to protect the public from serious harm. Each case is assessed on its own merits.'","Noye was jailed for life in 2000 for killing 21-year-old Stephen Cameron .

"More than 25,000 British military personnel have been found to be obese since 2010, shocking new figures have revealed. Despite the Ministry of Defence insisting its employees 'must be healthy', more than 16,400 soldiers' body mass index was considered them obese between January 2010 and September 2014. Some 5,000 members of the RAF fell into the obese category while 3,000 sailors were also considered drastically overweight. More than 25,000 military personnel have been found to be obese according to Government figures . The figures, revealed by the Sunday Times via a Freedom of Information request, seek to undermine the widespread view that all military personnel must be fit and healthy. 'I just find it staggering that the army or any public service should allow its service to become what I regard as less able to respond in an emergency,' Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum told the newspaper. 'These people have got plenty of time to keep in shape and I think it is a responsibility to feed them properly and give them any amount of time to do exercises and keep themselves in shape.' A spokesman for the Armed Forces however said it was 'misleading' to consider BMI a marker for obesity, as the weight-to-height ratio does not differentiate between muscle mass and body fat on the scales. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said it was a condition of service that all personnel must be healthy (file image) 'We work hard to ensure our Armed Forces personnel are healthy and fit. 'It is a condition of service that all personnel must be healthy and undergo regular fitness tests,' they added. Earlier figures revealed 50 people had been discharged from the Armed Forces because they were considered too fat to serve. In 2011 alone, 13 soldiers were asked to leave over obesity.","Some 16,000 soldiers had a body mass index which labels them obese .

"Farmers are producing ‘designer tomatoes’ by changing the flavour and adding Vitamin C by growing them under pink LED lights (file picture) Farmers are producing ‘designer tomatoes’ in a revolutionary greenhouse that can change the flavour and add vitamin C by growing them under pink LED lights. Farm technologists have discovered that changing the colour of the lights, from red to a fuchsia pink or blue, will alter the flavour, delivering a more home-grown taste. The new technology also means tomatoes can be grown all year round under glass, preventing the need for imports from warmer climates, such as Spain. Currently, 80 per cent of the tomatoes eaten in the UK are imported, which generates huge transport costs and waste. Farmers in this country have traditionally used sodium lights, which give off a white or yellow colour, in their greenhouses to extend the growing season for summer crops. However, it appears the LEDs – Light Emitting Diodes – are much more effective in mimicking the sun and they can deliver different colours of light, which can intensify the flavour. The LEDs also use much less energy, which means growing tomatoes and other crops in greenhouses under light through the winter becomes financially viable. Experts at the Stockbridge Technology Centre in Selby, north Yorkshire, are already growing tomatoes under the brightly coloured LED lights at a new 1,000 square metre glasshouse. Nigel Bartle, chairman of the British Tomato Growers’ Association, said the process of photosynthesis, which is the key part of the growth process, principally uses the red and blue spectrum found in sunlight. ‘The LED system means that we can target the colour of the light that the plant needs, rather than just giving a blanket white light,’ he said. ‘In doing that we use as incredibly reduced amount of energy. As a result, LEDs offer a great opportunity to grow something very efficiently.’ The trials also involve growing salad leaves, strawberries and garden plants under a mix of coloured LED lights. Farm technologists have discovered that changing the colour of the lights, from red to a fuchsia pink or blue, will alter the flavour, delivering a more home-grown taste (file picture) The research in Yorkshire is looking at specialist, highly flavoured tomatoes, such as Sunstream, a midi-plum variety, rather than the cheap bulk buy imports that tend to be bland or watery. Some of these were grown in the glasshouse through the autumn and harvested in December before going on sale in the area in the run-up to Christmas. Mr Bartle said: ‘They have been very well received due to their exceptional, just-picked taste. Sunstream is a lovely variety, with a deep red colour, but most importantly, that home grown flavour.’ Graham Ward, the chief executive of the technology centre, said: ‘Basically the LED gives us the advantage that you can build up your own bespoke colours of light. That allows you to change the flavour and shelf life.’ The centre is researching how changing the light and colours affects the taste and the nutritional quality of the tomato. There is some evidence from Holland that there are real benefits. A project between the LED manufacturer Philips and Wageningen University found that the system can produce healthier tomatoes. Crops receiving extra light from the LEDs contained up to twice as much vitamin C as others, even though the extra dose was equivalent to only a quarter of the natural light intensity on a sunny day. The Cornerways Nursery, based in Norfolk, which is one of the UK’s biggest tomato producers, is supporting the trial. Its general manager, Patrick Harte, said the LED system will allow the crop be grown all year round. ‘One of the large challenges around growing in the winter is the amount of capital involved, which can be £1m a hectare. The purpose of this trial for us to understand the technologies and see whether they deliver the returns we want,’ he said. Mr Harte told BBC Radio 4’s Farming Today programme that while people eat fewer tomatoes in the winter, there is still a large market. ‘We are importing a lot of tomatoes across the winter and having a high quality tomato that is fresh and local to market means we can get something that is better tasting for consumers,’ he said.","Farmers produce 'designer tomatoes' by growing them under LED lights .

Action: Officer Eric Parker has been fired over the incident, the department revealed on Thursday . This as video of the moment the Indian grandfather was slammed to the ground by the police officer and sent into paralysis has been released. Newly-released dash-cam footage shows  Patel being thrown onto the sidewalk last Friday, just two weeks after he flew to the town from India to visit his 17-month-old grandson. As Mr Patel undergoes surgery to his vertebrae, and his son files a lawsuit against the department, Madison Police Chief Larry Muncey confirmed Officer Parker, will be fired over the incident. In the footage, released on Thursday, Mr Patel can be seen standing on a sidewalk in Madison with two officers, handcuffed. After a few moments, one lifts him off the ground and slams his head into the floor. Despite being lifted up and dusted down, Patel could not stay on his feet - and after two operations no his vertebrae, remains partially paralyzed. On Thursday Madison police confirmed one of the police officers captured in the footage has been charged with assault and will be fired. Patel, who doesn't speak English, had only been in the country for two weeks. He had flown to Alabama to help take care of his 17-month-old grandson.

Tice (above) was kidnapped near Damascus in August 2012 . 'We feel certain that there's more information that could be shared with us. It's not shared with us because we don't have the appropriate clearances, and we're not vetted,' said Mrs. Tice, appearing with her husband on The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson on Friday. 'I said this before, I feel like God vetted us when he gave us this man for our son. I think that all the information available should be available to us.' Mr. Tice then noted that while the two have been in communication with the White House, he believes that the 'content could be deeper.' Tice was in Syria reporting for the McClatchy News, the Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets when he was kidnapped. It is still uncertain who took the man as no groups have come forward to take credit. Footage of a man who appeared to be Tice did surface in September 2012, just a month after his capture, and showed a man being led up a rocky hillside while blindfolded, looking exhausted as he made statements in broken Arabic. 'We feel certain that there's more information that could be shared with us. It's not shared with us because we don't have the appropriate clearances, and we're not vetted,' said Mrs. Tice about her son (above) This as Obama has recently promised to do more to help the families of individuals who have been taken overseas . The Tices recent media push, a far cry from the low profile approach adopted by most parents of individuals who have been kidnapped overseas, comes as President Obama has pledged to do everything he can to help these families in the wake of the death of 26-year-old kidnapping victim Kayla Mueller who was taken by ISIS in August 2013. She was reportedly killed by a Jordanian airstrike  against the terrorist organization. 'It's as tough as anything that I do -- having conversations with parents who understandably want, by any means necessary, for their children to be safe,' said Obama in a speech this week. 'We will do everything we can short of providing an incentive for future Americans to be caught.'","The parents of former Marine Austin Tice who was kidnapped in Syria over two years ago want more information from the Obama administration .

"A DIY testing kit for bowel cancer and other disorders has gone on sale in the High Street. The discreet home test is easier to use than NHS screening kits – and the results are displayed digitally on a screen. A green tick means no further action is needed, while an amber warning light suggests seeking medical advice. Experts say the £34.99 test will encourage middle-aged people to self-check for early indications of bowel problems, including cancer. A DIY testing kit for bowel cancer and other disorders has gone on sale in the High Street . Bowel cancer is the third most common form of the disease in the UK, with the second highest mortality rate. This is mainly because symptoms do not usually appear until the cancer is advanced, when treatments have less successful outcomes. But early detection allows for highly effective medical interventions that can achieve survival rates of up to 90 per cent. Two-yearly checks for bowel cancer on the NHS for people in their 60s and 70s use a faecal occult blood test (FOBT), which looks for traces of blood in stools. Yet a study by Cancer Research UK found many people do not go through with screening. Half of the bowel testing kits sent out by the NHS are not returned for analysis, with one reason being the ‘unpleasant’ procedure and anxious wait for results. The DIY bowel health test, called Measure, uses sophisticated digital technology to check for low-level bleeding invisible to the human eye that may be an early sign of gastrointestinal disease . The DIY bowel health test, called Measure, uses sophisticated digital technology to check for low-level bleeding invisible to the human eye that may be an early sign of gastrointestinal disease, including cancer and stomach ulcers. It has the same threshold for producing a positive result as the NHS test. Screening on the NHS involves a home kit which has to be returned through the post, with results expected within two weeks. It requires users to take samples from three separate bowel motions to make sure the result is accurate. The new digital test also requires three samples – but as each one can be screened instantly they can be disposed of straight afterwards, rather than having to be kept for several days before the kit can be posted. It also features special sealed cartridges to make the whole process more hygienic. Dr Helen Lewis, a trustee of the board at manufacturer MODE Diagnostics Ltd, said many people want to check their bowel health in their 40s and 50s but have to wait until they are 60 for NHS testing. Around one in six bowel cancer cases is diagnosed before the age of 60. Dr Lewis said: ‘It is getting more common at younger ages, and what is also concerning is that older people drop out of NHS screening, possibly because it is an unpleasant method.’ Deborah Gilbert, chief executive of Bowel & Cancer Research, said MODE Diagnostics would be donating a proportion of the sale of each testing kit to the charity. She added that bowel cancer is one of the easiest cancers to treat when caught early. Paul Reynolds, 49, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2008, welcomed the DIY test. He is now free of the disease, but said his GP initially dismissed his symptoms. Mr Reynolds, from Highgate, North London, now a Bowel & Cancer Research trustee, said: ‘A year before I was actually diagnosed, I visited my GP presenting with what I now know are classic symptoms of bowel cancer. He reassured me that it was nothing and sent me home without even examining me. ‘I wish I had had access to an easy-to-use home testing device. ‘It would have saved a lot of worrying and meant an earlier prognosis and less risk.’ The kit is available online at measurebowelhealth.com, on Amazon and in major Boots stores.","DIY testing kit for bowel cancer and other disorders has gone on sale .

"Postman Sandeep Singh, 27, who dumped hundreds of letters and parcels, was fined more than £2,300 at Nottingham Magistrates' Court (pictured) A postman who dumped hundreds of letters and parcels has been fined more than £2,300. Sandeep Singh refused to deliver in Nottingham because he said his Royal Mail bag was too heavy. He had lost more than three stone after breaking up with his girlfriend, a court heard. To lighten his load, the 27-year-old threw parcels away or hoarded them at his home. Nottingham magistrates were told he dumped 229 letters in bins over three weeks, deeming them 'unimportant junk mail'. He kept 50 items of post in his car boot and in his bedroom in Bramcote. Singh pleaded guilty to theft and delaying delivery of post, but was spared jail on Thursday. He was sentenced to 200 hours of unpaid work and must pay £2,384.32. Chairman of the bench Geoffrey Walker told Singh he was 'foolish', adding: 'You were paid to do a job which you failed to do.' 'Theft and deprivation of any sort is not pleasant for anybody. 'However, we don't believe that the acts you carried out were of the sort we often hear of, where it is a malicious act in order to deprive people of money. 'It was foolish, I think, rather than malicious.' The court heard Singh had been a postman for only seven months when his actions were discovered in August last year. He was caught out when binmen discovered piles of post when emptying the bins and he was sacked from his job. The disgraced postman later told police he was struggling with the heavy bags and regularly took out items to throw away. Paul Wright, prosecuting, said: 'He said he was struggling with his duties.. 'He often found the bags so heavy that he took out items he thought were unimportant. 'A large amount were classed as 'downstream access mail', often used by big companies. They often contain marketing information. 'But, by the same token, that same method of mail is used to deliver your phone bill, bank statements and credit card bills. 'All the items were personally addressed to individuals by name.' None of the 279 letters Singh failed to deliver were opened and the postie made no financial gain from the thefts. Nottingham Magistrates' Court (pictured) was told he dumped 229 letters in bins over three weeks, deeming them 'unimportant junk mail' David Henson, defending, said he had broken up with his girlfriend and had lost a large amount of weight, which could have contributed to his problems in carrying his mailbags. He said: 'The [break-up] had a traumatic effect on him and he lost three-and-a-half stone. 'I wonder if that had an effect on the amount of bags he could carry on his rounds. 'He tried to sift out the items he thought would not be lost to people - things the majority of people would call junk mail. Some of it wasn't but a lot of it was. 'He pleaded guilty on the first occasion and has never been in trouble before.' After the case a spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: 'Royal Mail has a zero tolerance approach to any dishonesty. 'The safety and security of mail is of the utmost importance to this business and Royal Mail will not allow the actions of any individual to damage the good reputation of our thousands of hard-working postmen and women.'","Sandeep Singh, 27, dumped hundreds of letters and parcels  in three weeks .

"Lawyers working for billionaire mining magnate House of Hancock agreed to the controversial drama House of Hancock being aired on Sunday night only if a disclaimer is run at the beginning of the episode. After reaching an out of court settlement with the Nine Network which created the program, on Saturday, the disclaimer will feature the word 'fictionalised'. No other details of the agreement were made public. Scroll down for video . Mining magnate Gina Rinehart has taken urgent legal action in the NSW Supreme Court in a bid to stop the Nine Network from airing the second half of its program, House of Hancock, on Sunday night. The Network agreed to let Ms Rinehart see the episode after she threatened legal action on Friday. A source told The Daily Telegraph: 'A disclaimer will be running at the time of broadcast.' The paper also said it was understood 10 edits asked for by Ms Rineheart after viewing the episode were mino . The scenes that were being cut from the drama were strictly confidential. The Nine Network also confirmed the second episode of the controversial drama, which documents the trials and tribulations of the billionaire Hancock mining dynasty, will go ahead. Posting a tweet to social networking site Twitter on its Channel Nine news account on Saturday, it revealed the lawyers who were operating on behalf of Gina Rinehart had reached an agreement after she had watched the program. The comment on Twitter said: 'Gina Rinehart's lawyers reach confidential agreement in #Houseof Hancock case. The show will air tomorrow as per schedule.' The mining magnate took urgent legal action on Friday to try and stop the drama from being broadcast, and was allowed to watch the second episode of the Nine Networks controversial new program, House of Hancock, amid concerns about falsehoods and defamation. Following a desperate bid to prevent the network from airing the second half of the program, Justice Peter Garling said that there was a real prospect the show would air if it contained statements that weren't entirely truthful- and perhaps even made up. Justice Garling ordered the Nine Network to hand over a DVD of the episode- due to be broadcast on Sunday- after pointing to remarks made by entertainment reporter Peter Ford that the second episode made Ms Rinehart look like an 'obsessed, vindictive shrew'. The episode was only allowed to be viewed by Ms Rinehart, her senior and junior counsel and a several solicitors. Ms Rinehart's lawyers had to inform the Nine Network if they were going to make an application to stop the broadcast of the show by 9.15pm. Her barrister Tom Blackburn asked the NSW Supreme Court on Friday to grant an application that would allow her lawyers to view the program before it goes to air on Sunday night. Her lawyers wanted to see if there were any grounds to seek an urgent injunction and prevent the second part of the series from airing. Mr Blackburn told the court about alleged inaccuracies in the first instalment and said the second episode was potentially malicious and defamatory. He said the action was sparked when Nine's A Current Affair program ran a story promoting the upcoming episode. Ms Rinehart, pictured here with youngest daughter Ginia, wanted to see if there are any grounds to seek an urgent injunction and prevent the second part of the series from airing on Sunday . '(It) gave my client cause for enormous concern about the likely ... honesty of that program,' he said. He said there was real concern about the 'severity of falsehood about to be broadcast'. 'Channel Nine knows that some of it is made up,' Mr Blackburn told the court. The first episode of the two-part series aired last Sunday and dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart and her late father Lang Hancock. It focuses on the romance between the Ms Rinehart's father and his Filipino housemaid Rose Lacson, which triggered the breakdown of Australia's Dynasty-style family when she became his third wife in 1985. Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose. More than 1.4 million viewers tuned in for the first instalment last Sunday. Mr Hancock and his daughter (pictured here in real life) had a strong relationship in the eighties, but it later deteriorated following his relationship with Rose . Tad Watroba, executive director of Hancock Prospecting, issued a statement to Nine's network boss David Gyngell following the first episode saying it was 'tacky' and 'damaging the memory of good Australians'. He said many of the scenes aired were fictitious, unfounded or grossly distorted. 'I know the facts, and this show has turned out to be a tacky grab for ratings, damaging the memory of good Australians along the way,' Mr Watroba said. 'Since starting promotion of the show, Channel 9 has not bothered to fact-check anything despite repeated offers when people have pointed out mistakes. Scenes from the series showed Hancock (played by Sam Neil) having sex with housekeeper Rose Lacson (Peta Sergeant) and Rinehart discovering their affair. 'You're the subject of dirty old man jokes from one end of Australia to the next,' Ms Rinehart, who was played by Mandy McElhinney, says. The first episode of the two-part series aired last Sunday and dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart (played by Mandy McElhinney) and her late father Lang Hancock (Sam Neil) A heated row depicts the father and daughter's explosive relationship when Gina begs: 'You're destroying this family, what will people think, stop it, she's after your money' A heated row depicts the father and daughter's explosive relationship when Gina begs: 'You're destroying this family, what will people think, stop it, she's after your money.' Her headstrong father retorts: 'You're the embarrassment, not me, you've let yourself go since having kids.. Look at the baby elephant you've become,' he barks. Hancock, once Australia's richest man, was smitten with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap and pursues the relationship smashing the bond he shared with his only child. What ensues is an increasingly bitter public feud spanning two decades involving murder accusations, drug charges, court cases, illegitimate children and betrayal until his death in 1992, aged 82. Among the alleged errors in House of Hancock, according to Mr Watroba, is the fact Mr Hancock and Ms Rinehart had a loving, father/daughter relationship. Mr Watroba also said Ms Rinehart was very close to her mother and did not continue to holiday or honeymoon in the United States when her mother was dying as the show has suggested. 'Mr Hancock never told Mrs Rinehart that no one could ever love her, or that her husband never loved her. The scene was made up and untrue. Her relationship with Mr Frank Rinehart was very loving, and her mother loved her son-in-law also,' he said. The show depicts Hancock's smitten relationship with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap . Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose . Rose was initially hired by Ms Rinehart to help her newly widowed father after her mother Hope Margaret passed away in 1983. She went on to marry her boss two years later in 1985. Ms Rinehart was bitterly opposed to the relationship and made a point of not attending the wedding in Sydney and even opposed Rose's business visa when she her father first began dating. The mining heiress now remains locked in a bitter legal fight with two of her children, John and Bianca. The pair are trying to remove their magnate mother from the position of trustee of the multi-million dollar family trust, set up by Hancock for his grandchildren in 1988.

"The judge overseeing the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez denied a request by his defense on Friday to bar police surveillance video that showed the former Patriots player using a lawyer’s phone to call one of his co-defendants the day after the killing. The video was taken in the parking lot of the North Attleboro, Massachusetts, police station on June 18, 2013, the day after Odin Lloyd was killed. Prosecutors said it shows Hernandez sitting in the car and dismantling his phone, then being given a new phone by his lawyer. Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, left, looks back as he sits with his attorney Charles Rankin during his murder trial on Friday . Hernandez stares straight ahead as a photo of a small handgun found in a wooded area near the crime scene was displayed during his murder trial on Friday . Prosecutors said Hernandez was seen using the phone and calling co-defendant Ernest Wallace. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said Friday that the jury will not be told where the phone came from, just that it didn’t belong to Hernandez. On Wednesday, a second juror was dismissed in the murder trial of Hernandez. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said she had dismissed a juror for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the case. That's the same explanation she gave to jurors last week when she dismissed another juror. The judge said that juror had discussed evidence in the case. That female juror allegedly discussed the case outside the courtroom and attended more Patriots games than she told the court. Garsh started Wednesday's session by saying she received a note from a juror about an issue. The lawyers, Hernandez and then the juror were brought in to discuss the issue with the judge - though it's not clear what they talked about. When the judge ordered the jury back into the court room, there were 16 jurors left - the one who was questioned was among them. Murder victim Odin Lloyd's fiancée Shaneah Jenkins is pictured in court on Friday, sitting with Odin's mother (far right) and relatives . Garsh did not give more details Wednesday. She ended the session for the day after about two hours, citing unspecified scheduling issues. The panel is now made up of 10 women and six men. Twelve will ultimately decide Hernandez's fate. Alternates will be selected randomly immediately before deliberations. Hernandez is accused of the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Yesterday, Hernandez's 25-year-old fiancée  Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity in the trial - a move likely made so that prosecutors can call her to testify. The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand. Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home. They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. Jenkins still lives in Hernandez's North Attleborough mansion with their 2-year-old daughter.","Video was taken in the parking lot of the North Attleboro, Massachusetts, police station on June 18, 2013, the day after Odin Lloyd was killed  # .

"Ed Miliband, pictured here with his wife Justine, has been challenged by MPs to prove that he did not try to avoid tax in relation to his property dealings . Ed Miliband faced calls last night to publish full details of his tax affairs. The Labour leader’s family affairs have come under the spotlight after he spent much of last week condemning ‘tax dodgers’. The Daily Mail told yesterday how he and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide ownership of their family home – which experts say is used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills. It has now emerged that Mr Miliband and his partner Justine Thornton – his wife since 2011 – both sold separate flats they owned in upmarket North London in 2008 and 2009 without paying capital gains tax. Mr Miliband sold his £740,000 apartment five months after the purchase of their family home for £1.6million and six months after the couple had their first son. But he claimed that the flat was his ‘primary residence’. Saying the flats were their primary homes enabled them both to save tens of thousands of pounds in capital gains tax. Labour yesterday insisted any suggestion of tax avoidance is a ‘straightforward lie’. And today Mr Miliband is expected to say he is ‘not backing down’ in his campaign against tax avoidance, despite the controversy about his own affairs. In a speech to the Welsh Labour conference he will accuse ministers of ‘turning a blind eye’ to tax avoidance. But the Conservatives last night stepped up pressure on him to publish the details of his tax affairs. Mr Miliband managed to avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of the flat he owned before moving into the townhouse where his family now live. Mr Miliband met Miss Thornton in 2002. In the following years, they owned separate flats. He originally had an apartment on Chalcot Square but sold this for £342,000 in 2005, before buying a flat on nearby Chalcot Road about a year later for £648,500. It is not known where Mr Miliband, then 36, lived in the intervening months. But Miss Thornton owned a flat in Maida Vale. This was sold for £680,000 in March 2008, with Miss Thornton paying no capital gains tax. A Labour spokesman has said this is because it was her primary residence. Yet when Mr Miliband sold his flat on Chalcot Road for £740,000 in December 2009, he did not pay capital gains tax either, as he claimed this was his primary residence. This is despite the fact that five months earlier Miss Thornton – an environmental law expert on around £200,000 a year – had bought for £1.6 million the family home near Hampstead Heath where they now live. She had also given birth to their first son Daniel earlier that year, in June 2009. They were able to avoid the tax in part because they were unmarried. Mr Miliband and Miss Thornton became engaged in 2010 and married a year later. Miss Thornton, however, is still registered as the sole owner of their four-bedroom Victorian property for reasons that are unclear. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Miliband’s family’s deed of variation was clearly designed to cut inheritance tax and condemned the Labour leader’s denial of this. He added: ‘Ed Miliband should now publish this deed of variation that he is currently hiding away and be as open about his own tax affairs as he demands others to be. The public can then judge for themselves.’ The former Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Keir Starmer, now a Labour parliamentary candidate, added: ‘People will take different views on deeds of variation and all forms of tax relief is, in one sense, intended to reduce tax. People have a strong feeling that sophisticated tax avoidance is morally wrong.’ MPs want to know if Mr Miliband and his family used tax avoidance strategies when trading houses . Mr Miliband has spent the week lambasting tax dodgers in the wake of allegations that HSBC’s Swiss private bank helped clients evade tax. He had gone on the attack over allegations of tax avoidance activities linked to some wealthy supporters of the Conservative Party, telling the House of Commons that David Cameron was ‘a dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors’. Mr Miliband was subsequently forced to defend his own tax affairs. Asked by BBC political editor Nick Robinson if he thought it was ‘dodgy’ to use a deed of variation and leave your house to your children to avoid tax, the Labour leader said: ‘The deed of variation... is something my mother did 20 years ago. I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I’ve avoided no tax in that.’ Mr Miliband’s father’s will was changed by deed of variation after his death in 1994 so Ed, David and their mother Marion all became part-owners of their £2.4million family home. This meant that if she then died, the sons would already own part of the property so inheritance tax would be applicable to less of the home than were she to have owned it outright. Mr Miliband has, however, since sold his share to his brother, who bought the remainder from his mother, who is still alive. He also claims to have paid capital gains tax at 40 per cent on the sale and denied he used the arrangement to avoid tax. A spokesman said: ‘It can’t be tax avoidance if no tax was avoided.’ Last night a spokesman for Mr Miliband insisted the couple only moved in together in 2008 – six years into their relationship and when Mr Miliband was 38 and Miss Thornton 37. ‘As HMRC guidance makes clear, primary residence relief continues for three years after you leave your home. The final 36 months of ownership always qualify for relief as long as the dwelling house has been your only or main residence at some point.’ BY JAMES CONEY, MONEY MAIL EDITOR . Why did the family change Ralph Miliband’s will? Changing someone’s will using a deed of variation is a relatively rare event and requires the agreement of all the beneficiaries – so why did the Miliband family do it? Was it because their father had forgotten something, or was it simply for tax planning reasons? If Mrs Miliband wanted to give some of the house to her sons she could have done that without changing her husband’s will – but this would have given her a tax liability when she continued living in the property. By altering the will and essentially making Ralph Miliband give a share of the house to his sons as a gift, Mrs Miliband was allowed to remain living there tax free. It also meant that when Ed and David came to inherit the house their tax liabilities would have been reduced. Figures produced for the Mail suggest this could have saved them £160,000 if they had inherited in 2004. George Bull, senior tax partner at accountancy firm Baker Tilly said: ‘A deed of variation is an established part of tax planning but it is not that common. Generally in the event of someone’s death the beneficiaries of the estate usually accept what is written in the will and shrug their shoulders and say that is that.’ What did Ed Miliband class as his main home from 1995 until 2004? In 1995 Ed Miliband owned 20 per cent of the family home in Edis Street, but also bought a second-floor flat in nearby Chalcot Square for around £100,000. Then in 2004 David bought the Edis Street property outright from Ed and their mother. You do not pay capital gains tax when you sell your main home, but you do have to pay tax on any gains you make above a certain level on a second home. In 2004, this was charged at a person’s highest income tax rate on gains of more than £8,200. Ed says he paid tax of 40 per cent on the sale of his stake of Edis Street to David. But exactly how much was the bill? Second-home owners have to notify HM Revenue & Customs which property is their main home. But they can switch this at any time. Every time they do this, the previous three years of house price gains are discounted (as the rules stand today, it is only 18 months). This allows second-home owners to reduce their tax liability when prices are rising fast. If Edis Street was not classed as his main home, it is estimated Ed’s captial gains tax bill could have been up to £56,000, depending on other gains he cashed in at that time. So which property was Ed living in from 1995, and which did he tell HMRC was his main home? Was it ever switched? Where did Ed and Justine live ? Ed Miliband first met Justine Thornton in 2002 and they married in 2011. For most of this time up until 2009 they each owned their own property. Last night a Labour Party spokesman insisted that they only moved in together in 2008. However, there are questions about where Ed lived between selling his home in 2005 and buying in Chalcot Road the following year. Up until 2008 Justine owned her own apartment in nearby Maida Vale. Had the couple been married and living together only one property would have been able to be classed as a primary residence – the other would have been a second home and as such any gains made on it would have incurred capital gains tax after a period. But because they were not married and apparently not living together there would have been no tax to pay. The Maida Vale home was sold in March 2008. It was only at this point that the couple apparently moved in together, into Mr Miliband’s Chalcot Road home. They eventually moved into a home bought by Justine in July 2009. Ed sold his Chalcot Road flat in 2009, five months after Justine bought their current home. He would have had 18 months to do this before capital gains tax applies.","MPs want Ed Miliband to explain his family's complicated  property history .

"People are being urged to dump a brand of frozen berries that have been linked to Hepatitis A infections in Victoria and NSW. Victoria's health department has urged consumers to dispose of 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores. Four adults, three in Victoria and one in NSW, have contracted potentially deadly Hepatitis A after consuming the imported fruit. Scroll down for video . Four adults, three in Victoria and one in NSW, have contracted potentially deadly Hepatitis A after condsuming the 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries . The product contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile . The health department has also told the company to recall the product, which is distributed by Patties in Victoria, but packed in China. It contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past. 'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday. 'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes. The outbreak comes as a number of Victorian hospitals are told to dispose of chocolate mousse, which has been found to contain listeria. Hospitals are contacting patients who might have consumed the dessert between January 29 and February 10. No cases of the illness have been reported and the product is not supplied to the general public. The contamination came to light after the company conducted routine testing of its products. Listeria is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, their unborn babies and the elderly. Several Victorian hospitals have been told to dispose of chocolate mousse, which has been found to contain listeria .","Three people in Victoria and one in NSW have contracted Hepatitis A .

"Rupert Murdoch says investment in renewable energy, such a windfarms, cost Australia too much . Australia shouldn't be building 'windmills and all that rubbish' to prevent global warming when the only outcomes would be perhaps the Maldives disappearing beneath the sea, according to media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. Speaking with Sky News, Mr Murdoch gave his frank assessment of the global warming phenomenon, conceding that because climate change was 'inevitable' houses should be built away from the shoreline. The News Corp chairman said investment in renewable energy should end and there was probably little that could be done to save the island nation of the Maldives, considered one of the most at the most beautiful places on the planet. In the same interview he also declared that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is an 'admirable, honest, principled man' who Australians should look up to. Mr Murdoch was speaking with The Australian's Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly - who quizzed him on the newspaper's stance on historical and political issues and how the newspaper, which Murdoch owns, should 'balance environmental concerns, climate change concerns' and the need to maintain a competitive economy. 'What's the way Australia should approach this (climate change) issue?' Murdoch said: 'Well I think we should approach this with great skepticism.' Rupert Murdoch said he had met with Prime Minister Tony Abbott three or four times describing him as an admirable honest and principled man . Rupert Murdoch said Australia should build houses further in land and stop its investment in 'windmills and all that rubbish' 'If the sea level rises six inches, that's a big deal in the world, the Maldives might disappear or something, but OK, we can't mitigate that, we can't stop it,' he said. 'We have to stop building vast houses on seashores ... we can be the low-cost energy country in the world. We shouldn't be building windmills and all that rubbish.' 'The world has been changing for thousands and thousands of years. It's just a lot more complicated because we are so much more advanced.' He called on Australians to be skeptical about the science of climate change, and said because the nation basically contributes 'nothing' to the global warming compared to the rest of the world, there was very little Australia should be doing. 'Climate change has been going on as long we have been here ... things are happening, but how much are we doing, with emissions and so on? Well as far as Australia goes nothing in the overall picture.' On Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Mr Murdoch said he had met him 'three, four times, and the impression is that he is an admirable, honest, principled man and somebody that we really need as Prime Minister who we can all look up to and admire.''However, how much does he understand free markets and what should be happening? I don’t know. Only time will tell. It's too early to make a judgment on this government.'He praised Australia for its entrepreneurial attitude, encouraging the country to work with its Asian neighbours, particularly China. 'We have to come to terms with the Chinese and live with them,' he said. 'I don't believe they are aggressive. I don't believe they want to take us over.'","Rupert Murdoch was speaking on Sky News with The Australian's Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly .

The outspoken senator made it clear that her political duties was always getting in the way of romance . In an effort to find a love match, she had to choose between a true blue tradie, a motorbike daredevil, a business owner and a business development manager. Without the four hopefuls knowing who the bachelorette was, Ms Lambie asked the first question: 'What is something a woman can do that really makes her stand out to you?' While the potential dates were only identified by numbers, the outspoken politician was already impressed with  bachelors three or four. Bachelor three responded: 'Outgoing and fun'. While bachelor four said: 'Someone who's not worried about what other people think but just is [sic] being themselves'. When asked if she liked any response out of the men? She responded: 'I do, I like the last two actually. The last two.' Ms Lambie picked bachelor number four who is Matt Tonkiss, from Sydney and he is single - ready to mingle .

With 10 seconds of thinking-time and a classic love tune to set the mood, the bachelorette picked bachelor number four - Matt Tonkiss from Sydney. Meeting her perfect match, she was asked what her initial thoughts were on her new man. 'He seems quite charming - he seems very funny so it's always good to have a sense of humour. I like the good sense of humour and he was quite relaxed over the whole situations.' Tonkiss was asked whether he was surprised by his bachelorette, he responded: 'A little. We'll see how we go'. As Ms Lambie said: 'Let's see what you're made of.' Hugging it out: the pair seem overwhelmed as they say they'll  see how it all goes before making judgement .

"Legendary Chicago Cubs player Ernie Banks may not have his ashes scattered at the team's Wrigley Field playing ground after a legal challenge by his estranged wife. Banks, who died in January aged 83, had famously said he wanted to be cremated and have his remains thrown to the wind at the baseball field where he made his legacy. But his wife, Elizabeth Banks, has now taken the executor of his will to court in a bid to stop his body being cremated. Legal fight: Ernie Banks, pictured above with his fourth wife Elizabeth, is at the center of a dispute over his remains . Claims: Regina Rice, right with Banks in 2012, has been stopped from cremating him by the court wrangle . Service: Banks died in January and had a funeral service and public visitation, above, in Chicago at the end of the month . Mourning: Die-hard Cubs fan Ronnie Wickers, known locally as WooWoo, lays a doll outside Wrigley Field in remembrance of baseball legend Ernie Banks in the wake of his death . Regina Rice, Banks's close friend and caretaker, was trying to secure the cremation, attorneys for Banks said. Rice has produced a signed will from last October in support of her claim, along with documents claiming Banks was trying to divorce his wife. The document makes no mention of plans for what to do with his remains, though Banks had mentioned the Wrigley Fields plan in previous interviews. However, if Elizabeth Banks's challenge is successful and the body is not cremated, there would be no prospect of wish being fulfilled. Scattered: Banks had expressed a wish to have his ashes scattered at the Wrigley field, where he is pictured above in 1970 . Her lawyers said: '[Elizabeth Banks] is without recourse and shall suffer irreparable damage should Regina's desires to cremate the remains of the decedent be granted.' It is not clear where Banks's remains have been since his funeral on January 31. Describing his plans for after death in a local newspaper interview years ago, Banks said he wanted 'my ashes spread out over Wrigley Field — with the wind blowing out.' The dispute over his body is part of a larger legal battle over his estate, currently being played out in the courts. Included in a of documents from Rice are claims Banks was attempting to end his marriage to Elizabeth Banks, his fourth wife. The documents include a petition for divorce, signed by Banks, seeking to end his marriage because 'irreconcilable differences have caused irretrievable breakdown of the marriage'. Caught: Shown above in 1967, Banks poses in uniform having just caught a baseball . It adds that Elizabeth Banks 'committed extreme and repeated acts of mental cruelty upon petitioner [Banks].' A document titled 'Last Will and Testament' and signed by Banks on Oct. 17 of last year says he was 'in the process of finalizing  divorce' from his wife and that he had appointed Rice as the executor of his will. Lawyers for Banks have called the validity of the will into question, saying it was 'allegedly signed' by Banks. The Cubs declined to comment on the dispute. Rice did not answer her phone and her attorney did not return calls for comment.

"They greet you with a smile, serve you drinks and some seriously questionable food while taking care of all your little in-flight problems. But there's a lot more to the average flight attendant than meets the eye. From some rather fruity in-flight slang to the tricks they use to look good even after the most gruelling of long-haul flights - just don't call them trolley dollies! Scroll down for video . Behind the smiles: There's a whole lot more to the average flight attendant than meets the eye . 1. They only get paid when they plane doors are closed . Despite all the hard work at check in and helping to cram those oversize bags into the overhead lockers, flight attendants only officially clock on when the doors are closed. Even if the flight is delayed or cancelled they will only be receiving a minimal expense allowance usually around £1 an hour. So bear that in mind the next time you feel like venting your fury on an attendant when you're left waiting at the gate for a few extra minutes. 2. They have some rather unflattering nicknames . These include 'Baby Jesus' for those badly-behaved infants whose parents do nothing to control and 'Crotch Watch' for the walk down the cabin to check everybody's seatbelts are fastened. However most disturbing of all is 'Crop Dusting' for when an attendant just can't keep their gas in any longer and takes an innocent-looking stroll down the isle to distribute it evenly throughout the cabin. 3. They still must be of a certain height and size . In the golden years of the jet age sexism in the skies was taken for granted. Attendants were always female and had to be lean, leggy and gorgeous. Pan Am notoriously specified  attendants must be unmarried, a minimum of 5ft 2ins, weigh no more than 130 pounds and have no children. If that wasn't outrageous enough they also had to retire at the age of 32. The golden years of airline travel, as portrayed in the film Catch Me If You Can (pictured) are long gone but flight attendants still need to be of a certain height and size albeit for safety reasons . Fortunately thanks to the women's rights campaigners of the seventies those days are long gone but in the interests of safety flight attendants must still conform to height and weight restrictions. They need to be able to fit in the jump seats for starters and while they must be tall enough to reach the overhead head lockers, they can't be too tall otherwise they will bump their heads on the ceiling. According to one poster, apparently recruiting cabin crew in Thailand, AirAsia requires air stewards to be aged between 20 and 28, university educated and with a minimum height of 5 ft 3 inches. 4. Mile High hi-jinks . We're not necessarily suggesting you should try, especially on short-haul budget airline flights, but it may come as a surprise for many to learn that it is not against the law to join the mile high club. However it is illegal for a passenger to disobey the commands of a flight attendant demanding you open the door and let other passengers got to the toilet. Naughty: If you absolutely have to join the mile high club it's actually legal but the flight attendants will know exactly what you're up to . And don't fool yourself for one moment that you are being discreet - the flight attendants have seen it all before and will know exactly what you are up to. So if you are really that determined to indulge in mid-air bonk just make it quick and please, for the love of God, remember to clean up afterwards. And just in case you didn't  know, those airline lavatory doors can be opened from the outside too. 5. They really can fight . They may be there to serve you drinks and food but don't even think about messing with a flight attendant. Attendants, both male and female, are now required to undergo self-defence training in which they practice sparring with each other as well as kicking and punching  dummies. This is so they are prepared to deal with serious security threats such as if someone tries to rush into the cockpit and take over the plane. 6. They are helping to stamp out human trafficking . Flight attendants work alongside law enforcement agents to help spot and rescue victims of human trafficking. In the U.S. attendants are trained by the Department of Home Security to recognise signs of when a person is being trafficked. These include when an adult doesn't know the name of a child he or she is accompanying or if a group of young women who don't speak English are being escorted by a single person. Now a new app has been launched that instantly tips off the authorities when airline staff suspect someone is being trafficked. The app even allows attendants to upload video of a suspect to use as evidence. Belt up: The walk down the cabin to ensure passengers safety belts are fastened is known in the trade as the 'crotch watch' 7. Those headphones that come wrapped up are actually far from new . They may look factory fresh by those neatly-wrapped headsets you find waiting for you on your seat are actually far from new. At the end of each flight the headsets are collected, given a quick dust and clean before simply being re-packaged for the next flight. A brand new headset for every single passenger would add up to many millions of pounds over the years and the bottom line for any airline is making money. 8. You can't use electronic devices but they do . While passengers are ordered to turn off all electronic devices for the duration of a flight the same rules don't appear to apply to attendants. When they are safely hidden from view one of the first things many attendants reportedly do is dig out their mobiles to fire off a few texts. But if you happen to catch them in the act - don't worry a mobile phone is not capable of bringing down a flight - the worst they can do is cause minor radio interference which can be annoying to the pilots. 9. They're all beauty experts . They've  worked their way through a gruelling long-haul flight but when it comes to say goodbye they somehow look as fresh as daisies. On some airlines, flight attendants are given on-the-job beauty training where they are taught the beauty tricks of the trade. On Virgin Airlines these include drinking at least at least one litre of water before, during and after a flight, exfoliating the night before a flight, having eyelashes tinted to give then colour, length and volume, using a hydrating facial spray and applying lip balm to  cuticles to keep nails hydrated. Tough customer: Flight attendants are now given self-defence training so they are prepared to deal with security threats . 10. They have to deal with some pretty crazy requests . As well as the infuriating passengers who insist on repeatedly pressing the overhead flight attendant button throughout the flight, attendants regularly have to deal with some ridiculous questions.","Slang used to describe different types of passengers and staff .

"CBS president and CEO Les Moonves wants to move the chains on brands' Super Bowl spending by upping the network's goal to over $5million for each 30-second spot. Speaking on a conference call with analysts Thursday, Moonves first threw up a $6million price tag he expected for the 50th anniversary championship game taking place in 2016. 'Five to six million dollars for a 30-second spot sounds pretty good to me,' the New York Post reported Moonves as saying, though he later revised the number downwards. Scroll down for video . Chief: CBS president and CEO Les Moonves wants to move the chains Super Bowl ads to between $5million and $6million per commercial slot . 'We’re going to get north of $5 million for each Super Bowl ad,' he later said on the call. Even a bump to $5million per ad would represent an increase of just over a 10 percent  on the price of an ad, as airtime for this year's Super Bowl  went for $4.5million. Media research firm Kantar Media reports that the price of Super Bowl commercials has increased 75 percent over the past decade. Not everyone agrees that stock in the NFL's marquee game is still ready to rise. 'The NFL marketplace was softer this year than in previous years,' one advertising agency executive told the Post. 'They’ve been struggling in the regular season, the playoffs and filling the Super Bowl.' While the championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots had a record audience of 114.5million, some ad buyers had to be compensated for lower regular season numbers. With Dad: YouTube voters named the Nissan spot as their favorite ad of the 2015 Super Bowl as CBS hopes to collect on next year's spots . 'So Les wants a 30 percent increase? It’s not happening,' says another ad executive of Moonves's upper estimates. 'They had to go to the second-tier guys to fill the Super Bowl.' 'I’d be very, very surprised if they get anywhere near $6 million,' the exec said. 'But there’s always one sucker.'","Les Moonves told analysts Thursday on a conference call his range for ad buys in 2016 was 'five to six million'

"A children’s book written for Comic Relief has come under fire for lampooning the Queen and depicting Prince Philip as a drunkard. The Queen’s Orang-Utan, by Little Britain star David Walliams, was written especially for the charity, with at least £3 from each sale going towards the fund. But it has been branded ‘well-intentioned but misjudged’ by Royal watchers due to its depictions of the Queen and members of her family. Caricatures: Royal slapstick in David Walliams's charity children's book has been branded 'misjudged' In the book, published by HarperCollins later this month, Prince Philip is depicted as a red-nosed drunkard, who in one scene pushes the Duchess of Cornwall’s face into a bowl of soup. Elsewhere, Prince Charles suggests a ‘solid gold diamond-encrusted stair lift’ as a birthday present for the Queen – hinting at a physical fragility that is not the case in reality. At the climax of the story, Her Majesty gives up her throne – contradicting real life where she has long refused to abdicate. Though the characters are not named in the book, their identity is clear in the drawings by Tony Ross. And Walliams has clearly set his story in the present day as it features Prince George. Royal biographer Penny Junor said she had no problem with anyone satirising the Royal Family and believed the Queen had ‘pretty broad’ shoulders, but thought the storyline ‘a bit odd’ as a children’s tale, adding: ‘I think it is well-intentioned but a little misjudged so I would award it two out of ten.’ Crown prince: George as depicted in the book by Little Britain star David Walliams, pictured right . In one scene, the Queen finds a Prime Minister who looks very much like David Cameron ‘an awful bore’. In another, President George Bush is caricatured in a banquet scene. Another Royal biographer, Margaret Holder, said the story’s suggestion that the Queen would ever abandon her duties was a ‘complete flight of fancy’, adding: ‘She will never turn her back on her official duties. She has made an oath to devote her whole life to the service of the Commonwealth.’ A spokesman for HarperCollins said: ‘David Walliams’s style is irreverent and fun. The book has been written to benefit Comic Relief and entertain children.’ A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.","The Queen’s Orang-Utan was written for the charity by Little Britain star .

"One potential property owner is a step closer to joining Sydney's 'millionaire's club' after the opulent Mediterranean mansion of a former tobacco executive hits the market- with an expected price tag of more than $40 million. 87-89 Wolseley Road, Point Piper, looks to challenge the record held for a non-waterfront property in the affluent harbourside suburb, drawing both domestic and international attention for it's sheer size and panoramic views. The property was last sold in 2004 to Bill Webb and his wife Marijke, who never thought they would leave after falling in love with the house they carefully renovated to reflect it's original architecture, and it being sold by Black Diamondz. 87-89 Wolseley Road, Point Piper, has hit the Sydney property market and is expected to fetch more than $40 million . The stunning three-storey residence is set on 1900 square metres, boasting views which run from Sydney Harbour all the way down to Manly, and is one of the few properties left on the market in the close-knit suburb of Point Piper. The trophy house was built in 1954, commissioned by General Motors dealer Bill Stack, and redesigned in 2004 by architect Michael Suttor. With interiors by Michael love, 'Mandalay' has been lovingly constructed to highlight the colonnaded terraces and ornate wrought iron balustrades at the heart of the property, reported Domain. The house has reportedly been on and off the market for several years, and co-agent Bill Malouf from LJ Hooker Double Bay said that the couple are now ready to downsize after their adult children have found their own homes.

The trophy house was built in 1954, commissioned by General Motors dealer Bill Stack, and redesigned in 2004 by architect Michael Suttor . 'Now that there's only two people in the house the couple are ready for something smaller,' said Mr Malouf. 'They told me that they would be leaving the property with reservations- I sold it to them a number of years ago and they said they couldn't see themselves leaving,' he said. 'But times change. It's such a huge property, just magnificent.' The 1900-square-metre property certainly is generous, with views that run from the Sydney Opera House and Habour down to Manly and Rose Bay- a claim that not many properties can make. The European-style villa houses six bedrooms, a five-car garage, a wine cellar and heated pool. The lower level is almost large enough to be considered a separate apartment, and offers a private gymnasium and sauna, as well as a swimming pool and a study. The large, open plan kitchen boasts a built-in butler's pantry and additional staff quarters for a maid or nanny .

'The property is pretty unique, and the timing is perfect to have a house like this on the market, especially with the Australian dollar doing so well in Asia,' said Mr Malouf. The estate agent said that the house had already garnered significant international attention, including interest from the United States and several Asian clients. 'All the major trophy properties in Potts Point have sold, so there's no competition for a home like this. There's nothing like it in the area,' he said.

"'Prepario trotta!' exclaims Fabio, as he flicks the reins on our horse and carriage, and we are off, bouncing along a dirt track through olive trees. We're in the heart of the Fasano countryside in Puglia, the heel of Italy. Our children Maisie, five, and Imogen, three, are holding on tight. Fabio chuckles: 'In Italy we always like to look after the ladies!' We pass workers raking the arid earth so the olives can fall on the ground. Trulli, madly deeply: The conical stone house Trulli of Alberobello is touristy but cute . A three-wheel truck is laden with crates of them, and on the wind comes the scent of a bonfire burning the fallen leaves and branches. Puglia is defined by the olive. Not only does it have the oldest tree in Italy - more than 2,000 years old - it produces 40 per cent of the country's olives and is renowned for manufacturing the finest olive oil. Back at the stables, Fabio introduces us to his shaggy Shetland pony, Emma, and the girls ride around the paddock. We are staying at the Masseria Torre Maizza, a beautiful old country house turned hotel on the eastern coast. Masseria is a Puglian term for a country house fortified against attacks in former times by Turks or pirates. The ramparts of the whitewashed Maizza have been converted into a Moroccan-style roof terrace, with idyllic views over the pool and nine-hole golf course. Ramparts: Masseria Torre Maizza is a beautiful old country house turned hotel on the eastern coast . The hotel has a private beach club, a short shuttle ride away, where we roam over dunes and splash in the surf. There are beautifully preserved medieval villages to visit: we plump for the famous conical stone house Trulli of Alberobello. It's touristy, but cute. One day we organise a cookery lesson at neighbouring Masseria Torre Coccaro, owned by the same family. We meet Cossimo the chef in the huge underground limestone cavern that was the 18th-century olive oil pressing room. We start with bowls of flour that Caroline, my wife, and the girls take great pleasure in mixing and kneading. Imogen climbs on the ball of dough. Pasta way to do it: Felix and family try their hand at pasta making in an 18th-century olive oil pressing room . 'Have you seen that technique before?' I ask Cossimo. 'No, it's a first.' We shape pizzas and panzerotti stuffed with tomato and mozzarella - the Puglian version of a calzone/pastry hybrid - plus a chocolate version for the children, before trying our hand at pasta. We make the Puglian classic ear-shaped orecchiette and a taglioni that Maisie takes great pleasure in pushing through the pasta machine. Food informs our other day out, a gastronomic bike tour. Bikes with child seats are available to borrow at the hotel. It proves as much fun as the horses. First stop is a mozzarella farm. Giant paddles are hoisted overhead to stretch the cheese. The cheese-maker twists up mozzarella and ricotta-stuffed burrata and we dig in at the tasting table. Next up is Masseria Maccarone to see the old stone olive press and try its famed oil. From there we pedal on to the nearby fishing village of Savelletri for a late lunch at the Pescheria. Owned by four consecutive generations of local fishermen and serving only fish, the Pescheria may just be one of my all-time favourite restaurants. We try the carpaccio catch of the day of six different types of raw fish and prawns. We cap lunch off with home-made ice cream at the seafront gelateria, watching the gulls circle and waves crash onto the harbour. We feel wellheeled indeed in the heel of Italy. Masseria Torre Maizza (00 39 080 482 7838, www.apuliacollection.com) has six nights B&B over Easter for a family of four (two children under 12) for £1,330, including Easter lunch. Citalia (01293 731753, www.citalia.com) has bespoke holidays to Puglia from £555 pp for a week, including return flights and car hire.","Family stay in Masseria Torre Maizza on Italy's south east coast .

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's organs are shutting down and it doesn't matter if Bobby Brown takes her off life support at this point, it has been reported. Family sources told TMZ that the family has come to accept that Bobby Kristina is dying but her distraught relatives are still trying to figure out what to do. Bobbi Kristina has been in a medically induced coma since she was taken into the hospital two weeks ago and her brain activity has been minimal. The daughter of the late Whitney Houston and singer Bobby Brown showed a glimmer of hope a few days later as her brain function improved, but her condition has since deteriorated. Yet, despite her troubling outlook Bobby Brown is allegedly holding on to his strong religious views and is saying he will do what it takes to keep his daughter alive. Brown appears ready to keep Krissy, as she is known to her family and friends, on life support, even if she has no hope of ever making a full recovery. And while some members of the family think that Krissy should be taken off life support, they reportedly respect Brown's decision to help her fight for her life, sources told the gossip site. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Organs: Family sources of Bobbi Kristina Brown suggest that her organs are shutting down and it doesn't matter if Bobby Brown takes her off life support at this point . Cissy Houston (left) and Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown (right), are pictured at the hospital on Thursday . It's been a difficult time for the Brown family and everyone connected to Bobbi Kristina. Earlier this week, the messy row between her boyfriend Nick Gordon and her family continued, amid claims Nick Gordon has not made any attempt to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend in hospital. According to TMZ, Gordon, 25 claims he has been barred from seeing Bobbi Kristina and has hired a lawyer. But the family said that he has avoided Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where the daughter of Whitney Houston has been on life support since January 31. Gordon was in their Roswell home when a friend, Maxwell Lomas, 24, found Bobbi Kristina face-down in the bathtub unresponsive. Gordon allegedly staged an appearance 'for the cameras' outside the hospital after Bobbi Kristina was admitted, but never actually went inside, the website reported. Sole sighting: Nick Gordon was only seen visiting Bobbi Houston's hospital once, on the day after she was found drowned. New claims say he staged the visit 'for the cameras' and did not actually go inside . Messy: It was also revealed that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found . Gordon has been in hiding since the photos were taken. And on Friday, he released a statement requesting that the media 'cease speaking with unauthorized members of the family.' In addition, detectives have launched an investigation into how Bobbi Kristina was found with injuries on her chest, as well as additional bruises on her mouth and face. Gordon has insisted it was wrong to blame him for the heiress's condition and that he desperately wanted to be allowed to see her. He told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby.' 'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know. 'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.' Gordon claims to have opened up discussions with Bobbi's family to try to persuade them to allow him to see his girlfriend, who has previously described him as her husband, although any marriage has been denied by her family. There has only been one public visit to her bedside by Gordon, one the day after she was found drowned at the home they shared. Uncle: Gary Houston looks tense as he arrives at the hospital to visit Bobbi Kristina, he is the late singer Whitney Houston's brother . Visit: Pat Houston looks toward the camera in a pair of black sunglasses as she visits her critically ill niece . Since then he has not been seen at the hospital where she is being treated, although her father Bobby Brown, grandmother Cissy Houston and other relatives, such as her aunt and uncle Gary and Pat Houston, have been seen arriving or leaving the hospital virtually every day. The source said: 'He is frustrated, missing her and has had to sit back and feels helpless about everything. He just wants to be with her.' Bobbi's cousin Jered Brown claimed Gordon was taking legal action to force the hands of her family to allow him to visit the young woman who has been in a medically induced coma since being found unresponsive at her Atlanta home. But Gordon denied any legal moves last night and was said to be in 'constant prayer' for her recovery. His attorneys Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy released a statement which said: 'In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not.Disco . Treatment: Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, has been in a coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since January 31, when she was found face down in a bathtub . 'Mr Gordon's only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina . 'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon. Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.' Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. Last year, Bobbi Kristina's maternal aunt Marion Houston sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April. Jered Brown said he had been helping Gordon, who was one of two people who found her in the bathtub, by acting as a liason between him and Bobbi's family. 'We sit down and talk about things he wants my family to know and what we would love for Krissy to know, and that is that he loves her and is just waiting for her to wake up,' he told the station 11Alive . 'To be honest with you, Nick is feeling very emotional right now behind all of this. He's pretty torn about about what's going on.' He said Bobbi still needed ' a miracle' to survive and urged people to continue praying for her. She had been troubled in the days before she was taken to hospital. Four days befoe she was driving and lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty, crashing into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and transported to a hospital, according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Police had also been called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there, but officers found no evidence of an altercation, said Roswell police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Scene: Gordon and a friend discovered Bobbi Kristina in the bathtub at their home in the neighborhood of Roswell, Georgia, pictured, on January 31. She has been in a medically-induced coma ever since . Whitney Houston was was found in a bathtub at a hotel near Los Angeles on February 11, 2012, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. The inquest ruled Houston's death was an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Bobbi was her only child, although Gordon had been 'adopted' by the singer at the age of 12. It is claimed Bobbi stands to inherit her mother's fortune of around $12 million when she reaches the age of 30.","Family sources say that Bobbi Kristina Brown's organs are failing and 'it doesn't matter if Bobby brown takes her off life support or not'

"Australian of the Year Rosie Batty has launched a revolutionary app for young women to help them understand the warning signs of abusive and controlling relationships. Ms Batty became an anti-domestic violence campaigner after her 11-year-old son Luke was murdered on a cricket pitch in Victoria by his father one year ago on Valentines Day. She said the Doncare's iMatter app will help educate women about different forms of domestic violence, increase awareness and support them to make safe choices. 'I think throughout our communities, at any age, we're learning it's not just about physical violence,' she said. Australian of the Year Rosie Batty has launched the iMatter app alongside community service group Doncare . 'Violence is also psychological, which includes verbal. 'It's not just about wearing a black eye and physical harm, it's far more complex than that.' Ms Batty said she was aged 40 when she realised it wasn't her fault. 'It was violence and no one ever deserves it,' she said. Research shows 22 per cent of girls under 20 have experienced dating violence. It will help educate women about different forms of domestic violence, increase awareness and support them to make safe choices . Ms Batty became an anti-domestic violence campaigner after her 11-year-old son Luke was murdered by his father a year ago on Valentines Day . The interactive iMatter app is also aimed a promoting self-esteem, and conversations between young people about healthy relationship behaviour. 'If you're approaching a relationship when you have no self-esteem you're most likely to enter into a toxic relationship,' Ms Batty said. 'It will not get better, it will wear you down and will reduce you to a very low point.' The app, which includes images, clips, quizzes and articles, is now live. It enables users to share and save content and use the app as a journal. Doncare clinical director Carmel O'Brien said it was like driving lessons for relationships. 'We hear again and again from young people that they are putting up with things in relationships that are really very disrespectful and sometimes frightening,' she said.

'Then I heard your father, ran to where you both were, which was only metres away and saw you injured and lying on the ground. I panicked and ran to get an ambulance - never to see you or speak to you again.' 'And now a year later I think of you from the moment I open my eyes until I lay my head back down on my pillow. I think of you every moment of every day.

"A man who was charged with the murder of his father and spent 10 months in jail before pacemaker records proved his alibi is now seeking $5million in damages from Ontario police. Frank Cara was visiting his grandparents on an early February morning in 2012 when his father Claudio, who he lived with at the time, was stabbed to death five times. It was Frank who found his father bleeding on the kitchen floor, the knife still in his chest. Cara was charged with his father's murder, despite his protestations he was visiting his grandmother when his father was attacked. Frank Cara spent 10 months in jail after being charged for the murder of his father Claudio (pictured) before pacemaker records proved that he was visiting his grandparents when Claudio was killed . Claudio's pacemaker had recorded his heart's very last beat, at 10:35am that morning. But that very evidence which proved Frank's innocence, and was provided to police by St. Jude Medical in July, lay sitting for months in a 15,000-page folder deemed 'marginally relevant,' according to the Toronto Star. Meanwhile Frank was sitting in jail, having been charged for his father's murder and denied bail by police in November. Pacemakers use electrical pulses to help regulate abnormal heart rhythms. They are placed in the abdomen or chest and are hooked up to a computer, which collects data regarding the heart's electrical activity. When the heart rhythm is abnormal, the computer directs a generator hooked up to the pacemaker to deliver the electrical pulses. Models like the one Claudio used also record if an electrical pulse was unsuccessful in its attempt to contract the heart. Which is how the pacemaker was able to record when exactly his heart beat last. Sources: MedicineNet, Toronto Star . It would be 10 months before his lawyers found the data that would set him free. Frank is now seeking compensation, recently filing a claim for wrongful arrest and detention, as well as investigation negligence. The 31-year-old said police ruined his life, destroying his career and reputation. Despite the fact that four witnesses confirmed Frank had been visiting his ill grandmother at the time his father was killed, Durham police were convinced he was the murderer. They tracked Frank's car, read his text messages and intercepted his phone calls, and even asked his sister to wear a wire while confronting him. And, according to the suit, one officer tried to ruin Frank's reputation with his family and friends, while another made threats to his girlfriend. It claims one officer said Frank 'was a drug addict, as well as a liar and a murderer,' and another warned Frank's girlfriend, who had children, that she would be reported to child protective services if she did not kick him out of the house. Bernie O' Brien, one of Frank's lawyers, said Frank was accused of the crime 'long before any sensible investigation had been undertaken.' 'On the flimsiest of evidence, they came to him and suggested he had been complicit.' Frank is now seeking $5million in damages from the police. His claims include that officers tried to ruin his reputation and that one officer told his girlfriend Jennifer (pictured) to kick Frank out of the house . Frank maintained his innocence and some family members, as well as his girlfriend, still stood by him. He also co-operated with police, providing DNA, fingerprint samples, his car and clothes. The suit alleges that police chose to 'ignore and bury' the pacemaker records, which were only uncovered by Frank's lawyers 10 months after he was charged . But the suit alleges police continued to fumble the investigation. They waited eight months to do a DNA analysis, didn't request Frank's clothes until days after the murder, and, although they had already searched the house immediately after the killing, they decided to search it again three months later. And when Frank refused to take a polygraph test because he found them unreliable, police took it as 'further evidence of his guilt'. Investigators had actually used the pacemaker as a threat to Frank, telling him it would have 'a lot of information' on it. Frank told the Toronto Star he remembered replying, 'go ahead and do that'. But they didn't and the suit alleges they instead chose to 'ignore and bury it'. Frank's charges were withdrawn in December 2013, after his lawyers had experts analyze the pacemaker data. It was ruled that 'there was no longer a reasonable chance of a conviction' based on medical evidence. A Durham police spokesman said they could not comment on the case because of current legal proceedings. As for Claudio, his murder is listed on the Durham police website as an unsolved homicide. But Frank said that, instead of trying to figure out who killed his father, he owes it to Claudio to restore the family name 'back to where it once was'.","Frank Cara's father Claudio was stabbed five times in his kitchen .

"There is a lot of grumbling on the way here - and not just from me. My wife's grievance is that, having given up alcohol for January, why on earth do we need to starve for a week in a remote part of Germany where we're bound to be confined to barracks because the weather will be foul. I don't have the nerve to tell her we'll be pretty much confined to barracks whatever the weather, with an exhaustive timetable of treatments and deprivations. My main worry is how to survive without coffee. But a friend had said we should 'throw ourselves into it' and throw ourselves into it we do. Lanserhof Tegernsee is the latest offering in homage to Franz Xaver Mayr (1875-1965), the Austrian physician who believed that health is centred in the gut. Lanserhof Tegernsee: More a sanatorium than a spa resort, albeit the most glamorous in the world... In other words, get the plumbing right and everything flows nicely. This outpost near Lake Tegernsee in Bavaria, about an hour south of Munich, has been open just over a year. It's a modernist monastery - all glass and wood and acres of calm space - built in a square around an outside courtyard with views of snow-capped mountains. The 70 huge rooms are immaculately white, with more cupboards than in most one-bedroom flats. Ours has two bathrooms - or, at least, two loos - which is a brilliant idea given the circumstances. My loo seat opens automatically when I stand in front of it. When we arrive at 8pm on a Saturday most guests already have repaired to their rooms. Dinner, such as it is, starts at 5pm. But because we have not yet met the doctor and been given our programme, we are allowed soup and tender lamb chops for our first meal. Or last supper. Lake Tegernsee in Bavaria, about an hour south of Munich, is the location of the newest Mayr clinic . A member of staff quietly explains that we are not allowed to drink with our food and that we must chew everything 40 times before swallowing. That pretty much rules out conversation - which is no bad thing, either, occasionally. She also tells us to pick up our Epsom salts on the way to bed, which are to be drunk as soon as we wake up and at least half an hour before breakfast. We're given a copy of the bible - Dr Erich Rauch's Health Through Inner Body Cleansing: The Famous F.X Mayr Intestinal Therapy. Not the sexiest of titles. Our first morning does not start well. We sleep through breakfast (served from 7am to 8.30am) and have to ask for special dispensation to have our tiny bowl of spelt porridge. Then we are measured and weighed. I'm nearly a stone and a half overweight, but am quickly told it's not a matter of burning more calories and that the doctor will see me shortly. Which he does. He thinks I could do with a liver detox (there's a surprise), some deep tissue massages (yes, please), plus a couple of intravenous (I hate needles) 'infusions' and various other treatments, including one called the 'hay pack'. Then he gives us detoxifying drops and acid-based capsules to be taken before meals and wishes us well. A modernist monastery: All glass and wood and acres of calm space, with views of snow-capped mountains . My wife and I are put on the Level One diet for the first two days. Level 1 is harsh: yoghurt and stale bread for breakfast (good for chewing), same again at lunch and a pot of herbal tea for dinner. A buzz phrase here is 'the luxury of austerity'. The stale bread is crucial. It means you have to chew, and the more you chew, the better. Saliva already gets to work breaking the food down so the gut has a much easier time further along the food chain, as it were. 'But where will the energy come from?' I had asked the doc. 'The detox,' he had said in that Germanic way that you do not question. There's a gorgeous outdoor saltwater pool near the gym, but I haven't the energy to try it for the first four days. I haven't the energy for very much, actually. This is not a spa resort, more a sanatorium, albeit the most glamorous sanatorium in the world. We are patients, not guests. The word 'therapy' is used a lot. 'Go with it,' a member of staff tells my wife, who, when not being treated, is in bed, the low point coming on day three when she hisses: 'Thanks so much for bringing me on this lovely holiday.' The 'hay pack' is a packet of straw that is placed round your liver, with a hot compress wrapped over it; 'energy island' involves lying on hot sand and staring up at lights that change colour; something called Feldenkrais is to do with the mind taking control of your muscles - at least I think that's right. In the gym, fit young things come up with all kinds of exercises to improve balance, tone tummies and increase flexibility. Lanserhof is all magnificently professional, discreet, caring, supportive. I turn native on day three and my big break-through comes on day four, when I bounce out of bed at 6.15am and join the communal 7am 'Awakening in the forest' session, where I imagine we'll be chanting 'the person I want to be is ME!' but in fact we just do some gentle warm-ups and watch the sky turn red behind the mountains. I've hardly eaten a thing, but I'm a bundle of energy. I want to get things done. My skin is softer and less drawn. My eyes have rediscovered their sparkle (my wife assures me) and my belt has tightened by two notches. Seeing the doctor the day before our departure is like an audience with the headmistress. She is pleased with me. My abdomen has less gas and air in it and if I keep going once back in the real world, my life 'could change for ever'. I've also lost nearly 7lb. More importantly, I feel better than I have for years.

"It was claimed multi-millionaire entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield did not pay tax for 24 years . Tax officials failed to prosecute a multi-millionaire property investor who did not pay any tax for 24 years, it was claimed last night. Entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield enjoyed a lavish lifestyle including luxury homes, a helicopter and a private jet but did not submit any returns or pay a penny in tax for more than two decades, according to the BBC. His case was said to be the most extreme to have emerged in Britain since the HSBC scandal was revealed and raised further questions about HM Revenue & Customs’ apparent failure to prosecute tax dodgers. Mr Bloomfield, nicknamed Boom Boom Bloomfield for his series of property deals in the Eighties, was reportedly named in the list of Britons with offshore accounts with HSBC in Switzerland. BBC’s Panorama reported he met HMRC investigators in 2011 – five years after his personal wealth was estimated at £60million – but told them he did not own any property of have any income of his own. Panorama said it had seen notes of the meeting, which said: ‘Bloomfield confirmed that his living expenses are paid from wherever there is money. ‘In his words there is a box somewhere which contains money and he arranges for the bills to be paid.’ Mr Bloomfield, who helped to arrange finance for the new Wembley stadium in 2003, claimed an offshore company paid his rent and another firm paid for his use of a Boeing 757, a boat and a helicopter. During his 2011 meeting with HMRC officials he denied having an offshore bank account, but the HSBC files – given to HMRC by France a year earlier in 2010 – reportedly revealed he had an offshore account with HSBC in 1993. Tax officials were said to have not believed Mr Bloomfield’s denials about not having any income and concluded he was liable for tax for the past 20 years, but he was not prosecuted. Panorama reported he was now living in Spain but said he had not responded to its requests for comment. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We don’t talk about identifiable taxpayers. We take a wide range of factors into account when deciding the right course of action.’ There has only been one conviction against the thousands of British taxpayers named in the HSBC offshore account files, although HMRC has said it recouped £135million in unpaid tax and fines through civil settlements. One former business associate, Mohammad Ghadami, told Panorama: ‘It wasn’t true he had no income, he had a few cars, a few drivers, security, a very expensive wife, an aeroplane. HMRC officials did not prosecute Bloomfield, despite reportedly finding he was liable for tax for the past 20 years. Pictured: The headquarters of the HMRC in London . ‘One thing he had, it was money. And he had so much organisation – accountants and lawyers – to work for him and to hide the money.’ Mr Ghadami won £110million in damages after a legal dispute with Mr Bloomfield. Mr Bloomfield’s previous addresses have been in Kensington and Knightsbridge, West London and he is now thought to be living in Spain. Former tax inspector Richard Brooks, who now write on tax matters, added: ‘If you haven’t paid any tax and you’re given a chance by the Revenue to come clean, especially when the amount is on this scale, and you don’t, then you can expect to be prosecuted. That is what you would expect.’ The BBC last night said that if HMRC had checked the data about HSBC’s Swiss accounts when it was first handed over, officials would have discovered one belonging to Mr Bloomfield and been able to take action years ago. ■Questions to BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead about her role as a member of HSBC bank’s audit committee went unanswered last night. The Corporation was asked by the Guardian newspaper how much she knew about activities at the company’s Swiss private banking arm – where up to 100,000 wealthy clients from across the world had secret accounts.","Claimed multi-millionaire Paul Bloomfield did not pay tax for 24 years .

"The parents of James Foley are speaking out about how they feel the Obama administration handled their son's situation in the aftermath of his very public and very violent beheading at the hands of ISIS. Diane and John Foley have said in an interview that they don't believe the White House was very good about communicating with them, and were not as concerned as they should have been about their son. 'We didn't feel Jim was a priority, even though we were told that from the very beginning that he was and just to trust that everything was being done,' said Mrs. Foley. Scroll down for video . Diane and John Foley (above) are saying that they don't believe the White House was good about communicating with them when their son was kidnapped . James Foley (above) was taken in Syria in November 2012 . This comes as reports in the aftermath of Foley's death have claimed that ISIS agreed to return him for $750,000 and that the government knew the exact location, down to the building, of Foley and several other captives of the terrorist organization. 'No one seemed to be accountable for these four Americans who were captive together. No one could give us answers,' Mrs. Foley told Fox News. Foley was taken captive on Thanksgiving Day 2012 and beheaded in August 2014 in response to American airstrikes in Iraq. Video of his brutal beheading at the hands of Jihadi John was then released by ISIS. Now, they Foleys are trying to enact some change in the wake of their own personal tragedy in how the United States handles hostage situations. 'Jim counted on our government to get them home,'  said Mrs. Foley. 'Jim was very hopeful and confident that our government would find a way. We don't want Jim to have died in vain.' Foley was beheaded in August 2014 in response to American airstrikes in Iraq . These statements are being echoed by the parents of a former Marine who was kidnapped in Syria over two years ago want more information from the Obama administration. Marc and Debra Tice said that they have been given little to no information about their son, photojournalist Austin Tice, since he disappeared near Damascus in August 2012, and that they believe all information should be made available to them. 'We feel certain that there's more information that could be shared with us. It's not shared with us because we don't have the appropriate clearances, and we're not vetted,' said Mrs. Tice. The Tices recent media push and the statements given by the Foleys, a far cry from the low profile approach adopted by most parents of individuals who have been kidnapped overseas, come as President Obama has pledged to do everything he can to help these families in the wake of the death of 26-year-old kidnapping victim Kayla Mueller who was taken by ISIS in August 2013. She was reportedly killed by a Jordanian airstrike against the terrorist organization. 'It's as tough as anything that I do -- having conversations with parents who understandably want, by any means necessary, for their children to be safe,' said Obama in a speech this week. 'We will do everything we can short of providing an incentive for future Americans to be caught.'","Diane and John Foley are saying that they don't believe the White House was good about communicating with them when their son was kidnapped .

"Former HSBC boss Lord Green has quit as chairman of a financial services industry body amid claims the multi-national bank enabled tax dodging while he was in charge. The Tory peer stepped down from his role as chairman of TheCityUK's advisory council with immediate effect, it has been announced. He took the decision days after it was revealed HSBC's Swiss office had thousands of 'black' accounts between 2005 and 2007, which were used to stash millions and avoid tax. Quit: Lord Green has stepped down as chairman of TheCityUK amid claims HSBC enabled tax dodging while he was boss . Sir Gerry Grimstone, chairman of the organisation's board, said: 'Stephen Green is a man of great personal integrity who has given huge service to his country and the City. 'He doesn't want to damage the effectiveness of TheCityUK in promoting good governance and doing the right thing so has decided to step aside from chairing our Advisory Council. 'This is entirely his own decision.' Sir Gerry will take on Lord Green's role, alongside his current position. Lord Green, who was chairman of HSBC between 2006 and 2010, has been under increasing pressure to explain behaviour at the bank's Swiss arm since it was revealed earlier this week. He is expected to be called before a Treasury Select Committee later this year, where he will be questioned about what he knew while in charge at HSBC. Information leaked to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in 2010 identified 7,000 British clients, 1,100 of whom had not paid their taxes. The timing means the agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in Switzerland before Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint was brought in to government in January 2011. But it transpires HMRC was only asked to vet his personal tax arrangements before his appointment. Facilitating: It is alleged the bank had thousands of 'black' accounts hidden in Switzerland, hiding millions from the taxman . Downing Street initially said that neither Lord Green, who stepped down as a minister in 2013, nor any other member of the government, had 'any knowledge that HSBC may have been involved in wrongdoing' until it was reported in newspapers and by the BBC in recent days. But the comments were at odds with claims by Treasury minister David Gauke, who told the Commons on Monday that information about HSBC had been 'in the public domain since 2007'. Downing Street later said it had 'no record' that HMRC told ministers about apparent HSBC involvement in 'wrong-doing relating to its Swiss banking arm'. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, told the Treasury select committee that HMRC had not passed on details of the allegations before they appeared in the media. HMRC chief executive Mrs Homer said the data was given to the tax authority under conditions which stopped it from sharing the information. Anger over the situation was made worse by the fact that while some £135million in tax and penalties has since been recovered, only one prosecution has been brought.","Tory peer has quit as chairman of TheCityUK's Advisory Council .

"Social housing tenants at a new multi-million pound development have been told to keep off a section of grass because it is reserved for the owners of the building's luxury apartments. Tenants residing in the 43 affordable flats at the new One Tower Bridge complex in Southwark, London, will not be allowed on the development's 'podium garden' when it is completed in 2017. Property developer Berkeley Homes was granted permission to ban all tenants from the special area, unless they pay an additional service charge, during a Southwark Council planning committee meeting. Scroll down for video . Tenants of the 43 affordable flats at the One Tower Bridge complex in Southwark, London, will not be allowed on the development's 'podium garden' (artist impression above) unless they pay an additional service charge . The 'podium garden', located between blocks three and four of the development (plans shown above), will feature a courtyard area, fountain and lily pond but will only be available to social tenants for an additional fee . One Tower Bridge, in Southwark, London, is set to be completed by 2017 and will feature a mix of 356 luxury apartments and 43 affordable homes. It is being developed by Berkeley Homes and will overlook the Thames . Original planning proposals for the One Tower Bridge complex, where some apartments are worth up to £15million, allowed social housing tenants access to all of the grounds. However, the decision was reversed following approval from the council and now any tenant who wishes to enjoy the 'podium garden', which includes a courtyard, fountain and lily pond, will have to pay an additional surcharge. According to Berkeley Homes, rent for Horace Jones House – the social housing section of the One Tower Bridge development – starts at a minimum of £171 a week for a one-bedroom flat, rising to a maximum of £161 a week for a three-bedroom flat. An additional service charge, which includes heating and water bills, ranges from £29 to £62 a week depending on flat size. Berkeley Homes said the cost of maintaining the 'podium garden' would increase the additional service charge by around 20 per cent. It means the garden area - which is located between blocks three and four - is predominantly designated for those living in privately-owned riverside apartments at the development, which are on the market for between £1.5million and £15million. At the deciding committee meeting last Tuesday, Berkeley Homes argued that the social housing tenants would still be able to use a communal children's play area and a roof garden on top of their eight-storey block. In submitting its request to charge tenants a surcharge for use of the 'podium garden', Berkeley Homes said it was necessary because of the cost of maintaining the area. According to Berkeley Homes, rent for Horace Jones House – the social housing section of the development (shown in the artist's impression above) – starts at a minimum of £171 a week for a one-bedroom flat . Owners and tenants of the luxury apartments will have access to a gym, rooftop Jacuzzis, swimming pools and spas. The social housing tenants will have access to a rooftop garden and a children's play area . It also said the additional charge would be levied to cover the cost of issuing access fobs, door entry maintenance, electricity or water and cleaning. The developer said those in the luxury apartments would have a 24-hour service to a Harrods concierge and access to a spa, gym and indoor golf simulator. At the committee meeting, Simon Bevan, director of planning at Southwark Council, said the exclusion of social housing tenants was 'not seen as any significant restriction on how they enjoy their property'. However, Darren Johnson, Green party London Assembly Member, said: 'This trend shows contempt for ordinary people, and is about developers selling luxury flats to rich investors who don't want to mix with local people. 'Mayor Boris Johnson and councils have been turning a blind eye to this for too long. 'They should simply refuse applications that have separate facilities or that refuse any affordable housing on this basis.' Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark Simon Hughes also criticised the council's decision. He said: 'Southwark Council has dropped the ball here - they should have thought about this more carefully before it went to planning committee.' The luxury apartments in One Tower Bridge (pictured) will be on the market for between £1.5million and £15m . Owners and tenants of the luxury apartments will have access to a gym, swimming pool, Jacuzzi and a spa . Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark Simon Hughes criticised the decision to segregate tenants by forcing those in social housing to pay for access to the development's special 'podium garden' Berkeley Homes said the City of London Corporation, which is to act as the social tenants' landlord, expressed concern at the level of service charge. The developers said in a statement: 'The Corporation of London had previously expressed concerns about the maintenance costs associated with their own communal roof gardens as well as the level of their service charge. 'These issues are exacerbated by access to the podium garden which brings with it a separate additional service charge that pays for management and maintenance of the garden, fob access through one of the private blocks and maintenance of the access areas. 'In reality, the affordable housing residents on this development will enjoy three times as much communal amenity space per home as the private residents. 'Every affordable home on this site enjoys two substantial roof-top communal gardens with amazing views over the river Thames, Tower of London and Tower Bridge.' The development, which includes 356 luxury flats and 43 social housing flats, first gained planning permission in 2011 and is set to be complete by 2017. Owners and tenants of the luxury apartments will have access to a gym, rooftop Jacuzzis, swimming pools and spas, the developer said.","Social housing tenants banned from section of grass at new development .

"It may be dominating the box office this weekend, but Fifty Shades Of Grey’s depiction of sadomasochism has already been scorned as disappointingly tame. Yet nobody could accuse its star, Jamie Dornan, of not going the extra mile to make his performance as Christian Grey as accurate as possible. The Irish actor spent a night at a real sex dungeon during filming in Vancouver, witnessing what happens in a den of depravity. Scroll down for video . Jamie Dornan, right, visited the real-life sex dungeon, right, during filming in Vancouver, Canada . The Mail on Sunday can reveal the 32-year-old – whose role in the adaptation of E. L. James’s best-selling novels is set to bring him international stardom – visited the city’s Rascal’s club, where willing participants can indulge in everything from floggings to being poked with cattle prods. Previously best known for playing sexually driven murderer Paul Spector in the BBC television drama The Fall, Dornan has dealt with more than his share of dark sexual fantasies in the course of his work – yet his night at the club proved an eye-opener. ‘He seemed shocked at what he saw,’ says a source who wants to remain anonymous. ‘There were men bound at the wrists being whipped by leather-clad women; people in stocks, and others tied up in all sorts of ways. ‘Almost everyone was dressed in leather or lingerie. It’s not your average night down the pub.’ Dornan visited the club last year while filming the movie in Canada. The film opened to lukewarm reviews on Friday – although it is tipped to take £72million worldwide in its opening weekend. The actor has spoken of meeting prostitutes and observing events at a dungeon in a private home during his research for the role. He admitted he was taken aback by some of the explicit activities. The sex dungeon, pictured, is located in a former church hall and features people getting flogged and poked . Some people in the dungeon are even locked up in cages, pictured, for their own personal amusement . ‘I went there, he offered me a beer, and they did... whatever they were into,’ he recalled. ‘I saw a dominant with two submissives, and he became our “kink adviser” on the film.’ But on his visit to Rascal’s, one of Vancouver’s longest-running clubs which offers BDSM (bondage, discipline, sado-masochism), what he saw was even more extreme. Set in a former church hall, Rascal’s boasts 12 ‘play stations’ where men or women can be tied down, strung up, whipped and chained. Dornan took pains to make clear he was there for research purposes only. ‘He looked, but didn’t touch,’ says the source. Club owner Sandy said: ‘We opened in 2002 and have a large, loyal following and we pride ourselves on confidentiality. What happens here, stays here. The book brought more people to the club. It’s been good for business, though I haven’t read it myself. ‘Many actors and film crews have visited Rascal’s – because so many films are shot in Vancouver – for research, curiosity, or fun. We have custom-made equipment you can’t find anywhere else.’ The club issues free condoms and submissives are given ‘safewords’, like the film’s Anastasia Steele has, to use if they want to call a halt to any activity. A ‘dungeon master’ watches over the participants. ‘Everything is consensual,’ says Sandy. ‘Nobody does anything they don’t want to do.’","Actor Jamie Dornan visited The Rascals Club in Vancouver while filming .

"A group of 'murderous misfits' in Canada conspired to execute a mall massacre on Valentine's Day as part of a suicide pact, police claim. The plot was foiled by law enforcement at the last minute after they received a tip-off from a member of the public, according to a Halifax Police statement. Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, 23, of Geneva, Illinois, and Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia, were arrested on Friday and charged with conspiracy to commit murder, the statement added. A third suspect, 19-year-old James Gamble, killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia. A fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody. Investigators say the group planned to open fire inside Halifax Shopping Centre on Saturday. A senior police official  told The Associated Press on Saturday that Souvannarath confessed to the plot following her arrest. She had also programmed a number of tweets to be posted to her Twitter account posthumously, the official said. Scroll down for video . 'Shooting obsessed': Randall Steven Shepherd, 20 (left), and James Gamble, 19 (right), allegedly plotted a mass shooting they were set to execute on Saturday. Shepherd has now been charged with conspiracy to commit murder while Gamble is dead, having killed himself as police moved to arrest him . Conspiracy: 'Randy' Shepherd (left) and James Gamble (right) - seen here with an unidentified man - allegedly planned a massacre in Halfix, Canada, with an American woman, who has also been arrested and charged . Twisted plot: Shepherd and Gamble have listed their place of work as Walmart on Facebook. Gamble (right) posted pictures and quotes of the Columbine High School shooting online, as well as Nazi imagery . Potential attack: Police in Cole Harbour, a Halifax, Canada suburb, search for a fourth suspect Friday, after three others were apprehended over an alleged massacre plot to attack a public place on Saturday . Plot: Canadian police have foiled a murderous plot that would have seen at least two people storm a public place and kill as many people as possible on Valentine's Day before committing suicide, officials have said. Scene: A teen, 19, believed to have been involved in the plot killed himself at this Timberlea house early Friday after police surrounded the property . 'It would have been devastating - mass casualties would have been a real possibility:' Justice Minister Peter MacKay speaks to reporters at a press conference on Saturday February 14 in Halifax, Canada . 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devastating - mass casualties would have been a real possibility,' Justice Minister Peter MacKay told reporters Saturday. 'The attack does not appear to have been culturally motivated, therefore not linked to terrorism.' 'A day known to represent love and affection could have taken a much different meaning today had it not been for the exceptional efforts of the combined law enforcement community.' MacKay said Souvannarath and 19-year-old James Gamble had been in contact online and allegedly planned to open fire at an unidentified public venue as part of a suicide pact. The pair were reportedly  obsessed with killing and death and had numerous photos of mass killings. 'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem on our community,' MacKay said. 'To be clear, all suspects are either dead or in custody.' Foiled: James Gamble, 19 (left), is dead and 'Randy' Shepherd, 20 (right), is in custody after their alleged shooting plot was foiled by police . Target: Police say they have confirmed the target for the massacre was to be the Halifax Shopping Centre . Extra security measures have been taken at Halifax Shopping Centre. Police said the group had access to firearms and presented a significant weapons-related threat. Weapons were seized by investigators, but it is unclear what type. Souvannarath - who lives on the fringe of Chicago - was arrested arriving at Halifax Stanfield International Airport by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police airport at 2am Friday. She was being picked up by Shepherd. However police believe Souvannarath made the suicide pact with Gamble. Gamble was found dead inside his parents' home in Tiger Maple Drive, Timberlea, at 1.20am Friday, after officers surrounded the property. Police heard a single gunshot before entering the house and the teen is believed to have committed suicide. Gamble's Tumblr page features pictures of him with a rife and a knife. Along with photos of the Columbine High School massacre, there is also a quote from the Columbine shooters, saying: 'This is a weird time, weird life, weird existence.' He also posted photos of a Nazi march. Gamble's father told local media he needed privacy to grieve the death of his son, according to Global News. The family's neighbor, Annette Casey, told the publication: 'The kids are a little nervous, you hear about things like this all the time but it's so close to home and you don't even know it's going on. 'My son used to actually be his book buddy at school when they were younger.' On Facebook, there are photos of Gamble and Shepherd together. They both have listed Walmart under their work information. Raid: The female suspect, from Illinois, a 20-year-old man, from Halifax, and a 17-year-old boy, from Cole Harbour, were reportedly arrested on Friday after the tip-off.

Armed vehicle: The roles of the other male suspects are still being determined as part of the investigation . Plan: The female suspect and a 20-year-old male were arrested at Halifax airport, while the 19-year-old male was found dead in the suburb of Tumberlea around the same time. The fourth suspect, a 17-year-old, was later seized in Cole Habour . The fourth suspect, a 17-year-old boy, who was arrested at 11am Friday at a house in Cole Harbor, has now been released by police without charge but remains under investigation. The plot was intercepted after a tip off by a member of the public. According to CBC, the information came from Geneva, where Souvannarath lives. The tip only came in on Thursday and police were able to make the arrests within a matter of hours. Speaking on Friday night, RCMP Sargent Alain LeBlanc said the plot to kill a large number of people at a mall - which was not named - is not believed to be related to Islamic terrorism. Officer Brennan also said he wouldn't classify the plan as a 'terrorist event'. Instead, he said the four alleged plotters 'had some beliefs and were willing to carry out violent acts against citizens'. Emergency response: According to the anonymous official, the woman had earlier tweeted a number of pronouncements that she wished to be posted after her death. The contents of these tweets remain unknown . Police at the scene on Friday morning: Officer Brunner said the plot was 'not culturally-based', adding: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there' Scene: The Timberlea home where the 19-year-old reportedly shot himself is seen in the early hours of Friday . He added that the plot was 'not culturally-based', saying: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there.' Speaking to AP, a senior government official confirmed the plot was not terror related. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Police have released no details about the motive. During a press conference on Friday night, Officer Brennan declined to release the exact location of where the four allegedly plotted to attack. 'We believe we have apprehended all known individuals in this matter and have eliminated the threat. We are not seeking any further suspects at this time in relation to this investigation,' he said. On Friday, Mike Savage, mayor of Halifax, applauded the work of police in Canada, describing the arrests as 'a great example of the fine work they do on a daily basis to help keep Canadians safe.' 'We have among the best emergency response in the country,' he told CBC News. 'The good news is they discovered all this and dealt with it very effectively. We always have to be vigilant.' In a statement, Canadian Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney also congratulated the efforts of officers in Canada and Geneva, Illinois, as well as border officials.

"A young woman who battled two years of obesity has launched a fund raising appeal in a bid to get rid of the excess skin from her body after a public hospital refused to carry out the surgery. Elora Harre, 21, from Canterbury in New Zealand, went from a size 24 to 14 and documented her inspiring transformation, during which she lost 55 kilograms, to her 20,000 Facebook followers on The Shrinking Violet. When she went for a skin inspection at Christchurch Hospital on Friday after a six-month wait, a plastic surgeon told her she was a ‘perfect candidate’ but they didn't have the ‘resources’. In a heart-warming letter penned to the Head of Christchurch Hospital and Health Minister, Ms Harre revealed the physical pain and psychological effect she has endured from having excessive skin. Scroll down for video . Elora Harre said during her weight-loss  - 'no surgery, supplements, shakes or quick-fixes' were involved . The 21-year-old weight-loss blogger has been documenting her journey to more than 20,000 of her Facebook followers at The Shrinking Violet . The weight-loss blogger, who turned her life around by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet, said she has been carrying ‘loose skin’ on her stomach, inner thighs, calves, lower back, arms, breasts and armpits. ‘Why is it that despite the fact we are quickly becoming an obese nation, for someone who has done what I was asked and lost the weight that could've cost our public health system A LOT more, that there is no resource for me?,’ she wrote in the letter. ‘I was told this operation would change my life. I know it would. I wouldn't have to live with the excess skin that is not only physically crippling with ongoing skin conditions, but also has a huge psychological effect on my life. ‘It is so uncomfortable to have to tuck your extra skin into your clothing each day, and have an ongoing staph infection as well as an irritated navel - yet this is not serious enough to warrant the funding. ‘There needs to be something for people like me. The people who have lost the weight that is so hard to lose, that you have asked to lose the weight, who are left with grim consequences. ‘I should not be turned away from the public health care system because I am otherwise healthy. We should instead celebrate the rest of my good health as a direct result of my life change, and be able to remedy the one part that is letting my health down.' The New Zealand woman turned her life around at the age of 19, after fears of diabetes or an early death . When she was 19, she decided to turn her life around because she was afraid of having an early death . Ms Harre has penned a heart-felt letter to the hospital and Health Minister in a bid remove her 'loose skin' She claims that the hospital has denied the resources because of a lack of consideration but hopes her letter could change their minds about the decision and to review the case. On her official The Shrinking Violet blog, she revealed how she turned herself to comfort food after her father passed away from terminal cancer when she was 10. Ms Harre said she found herself eating fast-food such as Burger King, McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut at least 'once every single day'. 'People used to laugh when you mention being addicted to fast food, like it was ludicrous and that you could only ever be addicted to drugs or alcohol,' she wrote on her blog. 'But the endorphins you receive from eating something so laced with processed sugar that your body thinks tastes amazing becomes incredibly addictive.' She told her followers that she doesn't share her weight as she believes it stops people comparing to her . She was 19 when she decided to turn her life around after having fears of suffering diabetes or an early death . Elora Harre went from a size 24 to 14 after losing 55kg in just two years from eating healthy and exercising . When she was at the age of 19, she decided to turn her life around after having fears she would suffer diabetes in the future or an early death if she didn't stop her bad habits. 'I had developed a deep fear of death. I never felt like I could confide in anyone about my fear because for so long my friends had made fun of my fear and teased me about it,' she wrote. 'It was then that my panic of having a poor health and an early death that pushed me in the direction I had needed to go for so long – my only solution; weight-loss.' She started seeking a nutritionist, going to the gym and doing cross-fit programs, as well as changing her eating habits and has now adopted the paleo lifestyle. 'I have been paleo since March 2013 and have never felt more physically or mentally better and I no longer suffer chronic headaches,' she writes on her blog. 'I have gone from incredibly unhappy, to incredibly happy and I truly do owe paleo my life, and gone from wanting to be ‘skinny’ to wanting to be healthy and strong.' Ms Harre claims she never shares her weight online because she believes it 'stops people comparing their journey' to herself. 'We are all different and lose weight differently,' she said on her Facebook. The weight-loss blogger turned her life around by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet everyday . The 21-year-old was told the surgery would change her life but she has been denied the public health care . Elora Harre, from Canterbury in New Zealand went from a size 24 to 14, during which she lost 55 kilograms . Along with her regular updates, Ms Harre shares her healthy-eating recipes and offers weight-loss seminars, 10-week challenges, eBooks, a support group and a 'range of other things for those wanting to embark on their own journey'. After getting the thumbs down from the hospital, her Facebook page has been flooded with emotional support as well as donations towards her Give A Little fund raising page. The appeal, which was set up by her sister Lydia on Saturday morning, has received more than $3000 from 129 generous donors but the girls are hoping to reach $25,000 - the estimated cost of her surgery. 'Elora unsuccessfully sought help through the public system to put an end to her on-going issues. After this revelation a lot of her supporters being the awesome people they are, suggested fund raising,' her sister Lydia wrote on the page. 'With so many people keen to give back to this amazing young woman, I thought to myself, heck yeah! Lets get this kicked off. 'I have set the target at $25,000 which is an approximate estimate at what the surgery could cost. But there is no real target for this - any donation at all is immensely appreciated!' Ms Harre has arranged an appointment with a private plastic surgeon for April.

"The body of Choi Chi-Man, 48, who died when an AirAsia flight crashed in the Java Sea on December 27 has been recovered . The body of a British man who died when an AirAsia flight crashed in the Java Sea in December has been found. Choi Chi-Man, 48, was travelling with his two-year-old daughter Zoe on flight QZ8501 from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore when it disappeared on December 27 with 162 people on board. Mr Choi, a university of Essex graduate who has family in Hull, was managing director of an energy company in Indonesia. He purchased his plane ticket and that of his two-year-old daughter Zoe on Boxing Day - according to the passenger manifest - and they were seated in the first row, in seats 1B and 1C. Mr Choi's wife, Mei-Yi Wee and son Luca, five, had caught an earlier fight to Singapore's Changi Airport. AirAsia flight QZ8501 departed Surabaya at 5.30am local time and was scheduled to land at Changi Airport at 8.30am local time. However, it lost contact with air traffic control during the flight, just after the pilot  reportedly asked to deviate from the flight path due to bad weather. The Airbus A320 was last seen on radar at 6:16am local time but vanished less than a minute later. All 155 passengers and seven crew on board flight QZ8501 died. In 30 seconds, it rose from 32,000 feet to 37,400 feet. The flight then dipped to 32,000 feet, before descending for around three minutes after which the plane's black boxes stopped.

"Three men have been jailed for raping a 23-year-old woman who admitted she could not remember if she had consented to sex or not. Pawel Chudzicki, 49, former soldier Michael Armitage, 44, and Rafal Segiet, 40, raped the woman at a flat in Lincoln in 2012. They were imprisoned for six years each despite Judge John Pini QC, who jailed the men at Lincoln Crown Court, attempting to halt the trial halfway through because of a lack of evidence. Pawel Chudzicki (left), 49, former soldier Michael Armitage (centre), 44, and Rafal Segiet (right), 40, raped the woman at a flat in Lincoln in 2012 subjecting her to a 20-hour ordeal . The issue central to the prosecution case was that the victim lacked the capacity to consent to the sexual activity. The victim, who had been drinking with friends, was taken by the men in a taxi to the flat when she was subjected to a 20 hour ordeal. The trial, which began on January 5, was suspended for a number of days when the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to put before a jury on the basis that a lack of memory does not amount to a lack of capacity to consent. Judge Pini told the court at the time: 'I've found this case extremely interesting and extremely difficult. 'In my judgment there is insufficient evidence from which the jury could determine lack of capacity and I will withdraw the case from the jury.' He added: 'We are left in the position that there is no evidence from which the jury could say she lacked capacity as opposed to simply having no recollection of events which may have been consented to. 'This is a uniquely difficult situation where, as opposed to (the case which is one of the leading legal authorities on these issues) there is a total absence of any evidence as to consent. 'I do not want this ruling to be misunderstood - I am absolutely not saying that a woman in drink cannot say no. 'I am not saying that lack of memory equals consent.' But in an unusual move, the prosecution sought a ruling from the Court of Appeal, arguing that the full context needed to be taken into consideration when considering the issue of consent. This included mobile phone footage taken by one of the defendants and blood tests showing a high level of alcohol in the victim's blood. The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the prosecution and so the trial continued. The jury went on to convict the three men earlier this week. Judge John Pini QC (pictured) halted the trial at Lincoln Crown Court saying it could not be proved the woman did not have the capacity to consent . Judge Pini made no reference to the Court of Appeal intervention when he sentenced the three men at court yesterday. He described how the woman had already had a lot to drink when she was picked up by three men, including two of the defendants, outside a Lincoln nightclub in October 2012 and taken to a party. The judge said the woman consumed more alcohol at the party where she had sex with each of the three men in turn. Her sexual activity with Armitage was filmed on a phone. Judge Pini said she was 'used as a shared commodity' by the defendants. He told them: 'All three of you had sex with her when she was so intoxicated she was helpless. 'She had lost the capacity to evaluate, discriminate and make meaningful choices. She had no capacity to consent. You all had no reasonable belief she was consenting.' The court was told divorced father-of-two Armitage served with distinction in the British Army for 10 years, including in the first Gulf War. Segiet and Chudzicki are both Polish nationals who came to the UK to work. Chudzicki is a father-of-three and forklift truck driver Segiet is a father-of-two. After the case, the victim said: 'I'm just glad it's over now.' She said the judge's decision to halt the trial and the subsequent appeal worried her and her family. She said: 'I thought it was all over. It was very worrying. I was very upset, the whole family were. And we weren't allowed to know exactly what was going on. 'They knew the evidence they had. They could have made that decision already, before getting to that point.' The trial heard how the victim had never met any of the men before that night and all the defendants told police they had consensual sex with her at the party. The jury was told the woman left the nightclub at about 2.10am after drinking around 12 shots of vodka. She went to the flat, where the three defendants were drinking vodka with at least four other men, and did not leave until 11pm that night. When she complained to the police later, a blood sample was taken from her. A toxicologist gave expert evidence at the trial, saying that at the time the victim was leaving the club she would have had a concentration of between 108 and 238 milligrams per 100 mls of blood with the most likely concentration 173. The drink driving limit is 80. Michael Armitage, Pawel Chudzicki and Rafal Segiet were convicted of rape and jailed for a total of 18 years at Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) after the Crown Prosecution Service appealed the judge's decision . In a statement read to the court, the victim described how the ordeal had left her unable to form relationships and suffering from panic attacks. The statement issued through Lincolnshire Police said: 'This has taken a long time - two years and three months from when this happened to the conclusion of the court case. 'I would like to say thank you to the teams who helped me - the police, GPs, health professionals and counsellors, among others. Not one person has made a judgement and they have been incredibly supportive. 'After this happened I went on anti-depressants, I got panic attacks, I didn't have a relationship for over a year because I had trouble with trust and intimacy. It was all very stressful, as was the court case. 'The sentence for each of these men is a good one, I am pleased with it, and it's a bit more than I thought they might get. 'I'll never forget what happened but I will move on. I'm now in a steady and happy relationship and looking to the future. I wouldn't have got through any of this without the help, love and support of my family and friends. 'I'd like to say to everyone that if you ever find yourself in the position that the men involved in this did that you should really think about what you're doing and make sure you know the person you're with is fully aware of what they are doing. Being drunk is not an excuse. 'To any girl who has been in my situation - if something has happened and you think that something isn't right then talk to people, the authorities or family and friends and hopefully they can help. 'It would be nice if something good came out of all of this and it could help someone else.' The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the victim was subjected to 'a protracted attack' which 'lasted 20 hours'. Lawrence English, CPS East Midlands Senior District Crown Prosecutor, said: 'This was rape as it was clear the woman was in no state to consent to sex. 'While it is, of course, true that lack of memory, on its own, does not prove lack of consent, the context in this case showed that this victim was taken advantage of because she was incapacitated, and that she could not have consented to sexual activity. 'It is against the law to engage in sexual activity with someone who is clearly unable, through drink, to give their consent. We are pleased that the Court of Appeal ruled in the way it did and the case proceeded to the jury for a verdict. 'The victim in this case has shown tremendous courage in this case. She suffered an horrific ordeal because of the actions of these three men and we are satisfied to see justice has been served.' Detective Inspector Simon Lovett said: 'Capacity and consent have been at the very heart of this case. The victim was in no way able to consent to engaging in any kind of sexual activity with these men, she was vulnerable and incapable of giving any kind of consent. 'We hope this serves as a warning and reminder to everyone that before engaging in any kind of sexual activity you must be absolutely sure that the other person has the capacity to fully consent and does so. 'I would like to pay tribute to the victim in this case. She has shown immense courage; from giving live evidence in court to seeing this case through to the end. We are grateful to her for her help and hope today's sentences offer some closure so that she can really begin rebuilding her life.'","Pawel Chudzicki, 49, Michael Armitage, 44, and Rafal Segiet, 40, jailed .

"A fire that destroyed one building of a Muslim center in Houston is thought to have been set on purpose. Authorities said that someone used an accelerant in the 5am Friday blaze at the Quba Islamic Institute, according to one of the imams's 25-year-old son Ahsan Zahid. Mr Zahid said that an investigator told him that the incident was a suspected arson, and that the fire was not an accident. Scroll down for video . Ahsan Zahid, 25, stands near the wreckage of a building at the Quba Islamic Institute in Houston, Texas on Friday . The fire, which completely destroyed the contents of a storage shed, is thought to have been an arson and may be investigated as a hate crime . Houston Fire Department said it was investigating and could not yet name the cause of the fire. The FBI said Saturday that they are monitoring the situation and could take a more active role in the investigation, according to Reuters. The Council on American Islamic Relations's Texas office has called for possible hate crime motivations to be looked at in the investigation. Federal agencies are expected to become more involved if that is the case. No injuries were reported in the fire, which largely took place in a storage building and is thought to have caused $100,000 in damage. The blaze started at 5am and caused an expected $100,000 worth of damage before firefighters were able to put it out . The Houston Fire Department is still investigating the cause of the fire, though they told Mr Zahid that it did not start by accident . The contents of the building, which housed the institute's computers, lights and equipment for a renovation, were completely destroyed. The center has a place to pray, holds community events, offers Arabic classes and also runs a Sunday School. The Quba Islamic Institute is asking for donations through their website qubahouston.org, and MR Zahid told Daily Mail Online that they had raised $2,500 as of Saturday afternoon. The institute said a man had driven past the institute and mockingly yelled 'Allah' on Thursday. A man with a covered face was chased away from the building earlier in the week. The Muslim center had been scheduled to host a talk by a former Guantanamo Bay guard who converted to Islam after the experience, Terry Holdbrooks, on Friday night. Mr Zahid said that the event took place despite the fire and that 'all programs, activities, and prayers have, and will continue as scheduled'. The institute's Facebook page has also come under attack from posters who have insulted Islam repeatedly on posts where the center is explaining what happened in the fire. The Islamic Institute used its Facebook page to reach out for donations and ask for tolerance in the wake of the fire, but their posts soon saw an influx of anti-Muslim commenters . Two suspicious incidents happened in the week leading up to the fire, including a man with a covered face who had to be chased away from the building . The center's Facebook account responded to abuse on Facebook by thanking offensive users for their perspective . The institute defended itself against the Islamophobic posts by thanking the users for their perspective and urging tolerance. The possible hate crime follows on the death of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that federal investigators are looking into for motives of religious hatred. Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were buried Thursday. Texas has the US's eighth-largest population of Muslims, according to the Texas State Historical Association . The annual Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin was targeted by anti-Islam protesters last month, the Los Angeles Times reported.

"Alaa Mahmad (above), five, was killed after being hit by a car less than one month following his family settling into a new life in Arizona . A five-year-old boy was killed after  being hit by a car less than one month after his family was settling into a new life in Arizona. Alaa Mahmad and his relatives fled from the ISIS-occupied Sinjar province in Iraq because his father Farhan Beeso, an interpreter for the US Army for two years, had received death threats from enemy forces. After relocating to Tucson as refugees, the child was crossing the road on Wednesday night with his parents and three-year-old brother, who has not been named, when Alaa left his mother's side and was struck by the car. As they left behind a life of horror in Iraq, Alaa and his family had only been settled in Tucson less than 30 days before he passed away, according to Tucson News Now. Beeso said that ISIS was fighting in the province and that he and sons went to the mountain and saw children dying because they were without food and water. 'It was a very simple life but scary because of my religion. I am Yazidi. The Muslims, they was against my religion,' said Beeso. 'They thought we are devils, we worship the devils but we do not. We believe in God too, we don't hurt anybody.' He also said that Yazidi women in the area were being raped and kidnapped by enemy forces and so he sought for a new life of safety for his family in the United States. After relocating to Tucson, Arizona as refugees, the child was crossing the road on Wednesday night with his parents and brother, three, when he left his mother's side and was struck by the car . The boy's parents said he was very attached to them and always slept between them because he was afraid . As the family mourns the loss of their son (above father Farhan Beeso, right, and mother, Khalida, left), neighbors in the community have come together in support as a makeshift memorial has been created outside their apartment . The memorial has been laid with hand-made cards, flowers and teddy bears from those within the community . 'I liked to be free first and the best thing I wished was the best for my family. I want the best future for my kid, I didn't want him to die in Iraq,' said Beeso. Alaa, who has been described as a 'funny' boy, had been with his family on the night of February 11, after they had purchased bananas and ice cream and were returning home. Beeso had gone across the street without using the crosswalk with the groceries, according to police. His wife Khalida and two sons followed shortly after when Alaa broke free from his mother's hand and ran after his father. Alaa and his family fled from the ISIS-occupied Sinjar province in Iraq because his father (above), an interpreter for the US Army for two years, had received death threats from enemy forces . As they left behind a life of horror in Iraq, Alaa and his family had only settled into their life in Tucson less than 30 days before he passed away .

Tucson Fire Department arrived at the scene and tried to give aid to the child, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the car that hit Alaa will not be charged in the incident and has been cleared of any wrongdoing, according to police.

"Judge Mrs Justice Hogg has allowed doctors to withhold chemotherapy from a terminally ill teenager with weeks to live . A judge has allowed doctors to withhold chemotherapy from a terminally ill teenager with weeks to live despite desperate pleas from his mother to continue treatment. The 18-year-old, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour by the time he was one, is now unable to walk or talk as his condition has deteriorated 'rapidly', according to doctors. His parents launched a 'fight for his life' at a hearing in the Court of Protection in London saying he was a 'miracle child' and urging judge Mrs Justice Hogg not to rule that he 'has to die'. The judge described the case as 'tragic' but she decided specialists could lawfully stop providing chemotherapy, end 'neuro-surgical intervention' and not resuscitate. She ruled that neither the teenager, who lives in the south of England, nor the hospital trust responsible for his treatment could be identified at a hearing which ended at midnight on Friday. Trust bosses made an emergency application to the court late on Friday and asked Mrs Justice Hogg to rule that doctors could lawfully stop providing treatment. The teenager's father had travelled to London to be at the hearing, but returned to his son's bedside when doctors said the teenager had taken turn for the worst. The 18-year-old's mother pleaded with the judge from the hospital where he is being cared for - via a telephone link to the court room. She told the judge: 'I don't want to hear you say he has to die. I don't want to be part of that. I'm afraid I can't.' Mrs Justice Hogg at one point ordered a break in the hearing to allow the woman to go to the teenager's bedside . Doctors had said they feared that the teenager had no more than two weeks to live. A neuro-surgeon told the judge that 'active treatment' was 'futile', saying the teenager should be allowed to end his life in as much 'dignity and comfort' as possible. Mrs Justice Hogg heard that the teenager had been diagnosed with a brain tumour by the time he was one, and was registered blind. But he had been able to go to school, travel and play some sports. 'He has shown particular resilience and courage,' said the judge. 'His mother ... has fought every corner for him. And he has fought a few corners for himself.' Doctors said his condition had deteriorated recently and the cancer had spread. They said he could not walk or talk and could only lift his limbs with difficulty. The neuro-surgeon said the teenager was 'going in and out of coma'. All clinicians involved in his care had concluded that further chemotherapy and neurosurgical intervention was futile and not in his best interests, the judge was told. But the teenager's parents disagreed, his mother telling the hearing: 'I am fighting for my child's life. 'He is a sick child but he is coping. (He) is not dying.' The teenager was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of one, but a neuro-surgeon told the judge that providing any more 'active treatment' was 'futile' She questioned the neurosurgeon and a cancer specialist who gave evidence at the hearing. 'Give him a chance. Maybe chemo will work. If (he) goes he goes. But he may not. He may have months to live,' she said. '(He) may not be able to do martial arts but he talks, he walks. He is a pleasure to be with.' The woman said he son had a 'normal life' for a child who had a brain tumour. 'It's just seems you want him to die. The sooner the better,' she told one doctor at the hearing. 'It makes me worry you are not acting in his best interests. You just want it to get over and done with.' She added: 'We may be lucky and he will live a few months or a miracle will happen. You just have to believe he will pull through.' The woman said he son still got a 'lot of enjoyment' from his family and told the judge that they 'absolutely adored' him. 'He is a miracle child and has survived things you thought he would not,' she said. 'He deserves a chance.' She added: 'Doctors should treat the patient to the very end. That is how I see it. He deserves the right to be treated. He is still your patient.' The neurosurgeon told the woman of his sorrow, saying: 'I am so sorry for what you are going through. It is such a terrible time.' He added: 'I am finding this very difficult ... I don't like to see children die.' Barrister John McKendrick, for the teenager's father, said his client also wanted chemotherapy to continue. Mrs Justice Hogg said she understood how difficult the situation was for the teenager's parents. 'The parents want everything to be done to keep (him) alive,' she said. 'The mother is clearly very passionate. The father follows suit.' But she said she had to base her decision on the evidence and decide what was in the teenager's best interests, and made no criticism of doctors or medical staff. 'The evidence shows that (he) is in the last phase of his life,' she said. 'The doctors ... say the time has now come for palliative treatment only.' She added: 'I am satisfied that chemotherapy should not be resumed.' And she said there should be no resuscitation and no neuro-surgical treatment. She said the teenager should get as much palliative treatment and care as could be offered. The judge had concluded that the teenager lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about treatment, or to litigate. He had been represented at the hearing by court-appointed lawyers and a barrister had questioned doctors on his behalf. Mrs Justice Hogg said she had asked herself what the teenager would want, adding that it was a difficult question because there was no 'real evidence' from him.","The 18-year-old boy was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of one .

"The cunning game of cat and mouse between England’s greatest detective and his nemesis Professor Moriarty is the stuff of literary legend. And it almost seemed as if Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch was trying to outwit his on-screen adversary in real life yesterday, as he took ingenious steps to keep his wedding secret. Yet actor Andrew Scott, who plays the master criminal in the latest BBC adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s books, nonetheless managed to find his way to the Isle of Wight church where the ceremony took place. Scroll down for video . Nemesis: Benedict Cumberbatch married Sophie Hunter today. Pictured arriving at the church is Andrew Scott, who plays Cumberbatch's arch-rival Moriarty in Sherlock, and actor Tobias Menzies (top left) Intimate: The hasilty-arranged ceremony, organised to take place before pregnant Hunter gives birth, took place in this church in front of friends and family today . The bride and groom's car, thought to be a classic Mark VII Jaguar, was pictured pulling up to the church today, but there was no sign of Mr Cumberbatch or Miss Hunter . One especially stylish guest, dressed in a cream double-breasted waistcoat and tartan print trousers, waits outside the church on the Isle of Wight this morning . Cumberbatch went to extraordinary lengths to keep his wedding secret, especially from the press and his fans. Roads around the village of Mottistone were cordoned off, staff at the hotel where the wedding party celebrated were sworn to secrecy, and, in a particularly deft touch, a white van drew up outside the church at the crucial moment Cumberbatch and his new bride Sophie Hunter emerged, blocking the view. The sneaky deployment of the vehicle was a sly echo of the moment in the 2012 TV series when the detective used a truck in the plot to fake his death. Scott has previously joked about his screen relationship with 38-year-old Cumberbatch, reacting to the recent news that he is to become a dad, by joking: ‘I don’t think Benedict will ask me to be a godfather. I’m his arch nemesis.’ But he was one of 40 family and friends invited to yesterday’s ceremony at the 12th Century St Peter and St Paul church. Other guests included his War Horse co-star Tom Hiddleston. The party arrived there just before 3pm to be greeted by around a dozen wellwishers. They enjoyed fine weather but the rain began to fall when the 36-year-old bride arrived at church wearing a traditional white dress at just after 3.20pm. Sophie Hunter, left, got married to Hollywood star Benedict Cumberbatch, right, on the Isle of Wight today . In Sherlock, Cumberbatch was best man at sidekick Wason's wedding - while in real life, Martin Freeman is thought to have been Cumberbatch's best man . Guests arrive ahead of the ceremony today. Martin Freeman, who plays Watson in BBC series Sherlock, was expected to be the best man . It was thought that Keira Knightley, who starred alongside Cumberbatch in the Imitation Game would attend, but she was spotted in LA today . Invatations were sent to guests via email because the ceremony was organised at short notice, believed to be because the couple wanted it to take place before Miss Hunter gave birth . After the hour-long ceremony, the couple climbed into a car to drive the short distance to Mottistone Manor for their reception. Cumberbatch’s choice of the Isle of Wight came as a surprise to local residents who had no idea why he had chosen the island. But bride Sophie, a theatre and opera director, is thought to be distantly related to the first Lord Mottistone. Cumberbatch’s hopes to keep the ceremony entirely secret were foiled when marquees began to appear in the grounds of the manor and road closure signs were erected close to the church. The star is believed to have spent Friday night at the George Hotel in Yarmouth on the island. That evening, he joined 140 guests for a party there. Staff were sworn to secrecy but one employee said: ‘Benedict had a big party here on Friday night. There were about 140 people and it was a buffet meal. We have all been told to keep quiet about it and not tell anyone.’ The happy couple have known each other for five years, but were dating for just five months before the engagement was announced (pictured, guests arrive at the church today) Intimate: The couple had been publicly dating for just five months before the wedding was announced . Close: Cumberbatch's Sherlock co-star Martin Freeman, , is understood to be best man . Several of the partygoers spent the night in the hotel. And yesterday morning, locals joined in the pre-wedding excitement by posting a series of tweets. Local councillor Chris Whitehouse wrote: ‘Isle of Wight’s gone mad with Benedict Cumberbatch marriage fever this morning. Fans of both genders flocking to Mottistone for a glimpse.’ Another added: ‘So if everyone is camped out at Mottistone church to gatecrash the celeb wedding, does that mean Sainsbury’s will be nice and quiet?’ There had been speculation that Martin Freeman, who plays Dr Watson to Cumberbatch’s Sherlock, may have been best man. But Freeman’s partner Amanda Abbington said such rumours were ‘bowel-shatteringly, mind-numbingly wrong’. Cumberbatch is also a frontrunner to take the Best Actor award at next weekend’s Oscars, thanks to his acclaimed performance as the gay Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing in The Imitation Game. Spotted: The pair were first seen watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June . Tying the knot: News of the wedding comes just three months after their engagement was announced in Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times newspaper on November 5 .","Couple got married today at 'stunning period property' on Isle of Wight .

"President Obama’s outgoing counselor John Podesta has revealed that his biggest regret in 2014 was his failure to disclose the truth about the existence of UFOs. On Friday, Podesta marked the conclusion of his latest stint at the White House by listing on Twitter his top 10 triumphs and failures from the past year. Among his high points, the 66-year-old law professor listed taking a ride in a NASCAR vehicle, hosting a famous chef at his home, as well as a few more serious accomplishments: the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Monument to twice the size of Texas, the first-ever proposal to limit carbon pollution and significant progress on climate change. Scroll down for video . A serious man: President Obama’s outgoing counselor John Podesta has revealed that his biggest regret in 2014 was his failure to disclose the truth about the existence of UFOs . Top 10 list: Podesta marked the conclusion of his year-long stint at the White House by listing on Twitter his top triumphs and failures from 2014 . The presidential counselor also had a couple of low points in 2014, including being defeated in a 12K race by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, who is 20 years his junior. But nothing exasperated Podesta more than keeping Americans in the dark about extra-terrestrials. 'Finally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the UFO files.' The tweet was accompanied by the hashtag #thetruthisstilloutthere - a play on the famous tagline from the TV show The X-Files. Podesta, a married father of three who served as Bill Clinton’s final White House chief of staff for four years in the 1990s, has long been fascinated with aliens. During a 2002 press conference hosted by the Coalition for Freedom of Information, Podesta declared: 'It's time to find out what the truth really is that's out there, reported Yahoo News. 'We ought to do it, quite frankly, because the American people can handle the truth.' Right-hand man: President Obama  brought on Podesta a year ago after the disastrous rollout of his health care law . Special interest: The 66-year-old law professor's fascination with UFOs has been well-documented . In 2010, John Podesta wrote an introduction for the book UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go On the Record. Now that he is back in the private sector, Podesta is expected to take the reins of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. While shepherding the president’s climate change agenda and shaping his strategy for dealing with a Republican-led Congress, Podesta has also been involved in nearly every key conversation with Clinton on campaign hires and her burgeoning organization, as well as the timing of a formal announcement of her candidacy. Obama brought on Podesta after the disastrous rollout of his health care law. Several current and former White House officials said Podesta – regarded by many as an alder statesman - quickly injected more depth into strategy discussions and would often play devil’s advocate, pushing the team to consider things not on their radar. New boss: Podesta is expected to take the reins of Hillary Clinton’s (right) 2016 presidential campaign . Podesta also ingratiated himself with Obama’s team, particularly younger aides. An avid cook – his specialty is Italian, including risotto and biscotti – he would invite staffers to his home in Northwest Washington for celebratory dinners after finishing big projects. On Friday, Podesta tweeted that his biggest culinary feat last year was hosting a dinner for New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman and senior presidential adviser on nutrition policy Sam Kass. 'I let them mince herbs for the risotto. They didn’t screw up,' he quipped.","Friday marked John Podesta's last day as President Obama's counselor .

"Many couples think of their wedding day as the start of a new life together but these Thai newlyweds seem to have taken the idea more seriously than most - lying in a coffin as they said their vows . The wedding ritual, conducted by monks, allows couples to rid themselves of bad luck by being 'brought back to life' and is believed to bring true love, prosperity, and protection from harm. Ten couples took part in the unusual mass ceremony at a temple on the outskirts of Bangkok today. 'Til death do us part: One of the ten couples who took part in today's ceremony are pictured lying in the coffin with wedding bouquets. Monks represent the end of their lives by covering them in a white sheet . New life: Once they have been blessed, the couple are brought 'back to life' - free from all their bad luck . Ritual: In exchange for offerings, the monks perform chants usually reserved for funerals to bless the couple . Participants made offerings to the monks before taking their places side-by-side in the large pink coffin - floral bouquets held to their chests. The monks then draped a large white sheet across them - representing their death - and performed chants usually reserved for funerals. The prayers ended with blessings for a new life. When the sheet is removed from the coffin, it signals the start of a life free from bad luck, abbot Phra Kru Samu Sa-ngob Kittkayo, told the Bangkok Post. It also could serve as a reminder for couples to live with the reality that nothing lasts forever - a key component of the Buddhist philosophy. Wedding blessings: The ceremony is believed to bring true love, prosperity, and protection from harm . Spiritual meaning: It also could serve as a reminder for couples to live with the reality that nothing lasts forever . The temple held the event for the first time last year when Valentine's Day fell on Makha Bucha Day - a Buddhist holiday - giving couples the chance to marry as part of a religious ceremony. The abbot said he originally had no plan to repeat the event, but that a number of brides and grooms had contacted the temple asking for their marriages to be blessed. Among the couples at the temple were two women, Pichaya Thaenphim and Pattaranaya Kamploy, who have been together for more than three years. They said the temple had agreed to include them in the ceremony even though homosexual marriage remains illegal in Thailand, local newspapers reported.","Ten couples took part in ceremony at temple on the outskirts of Bangkok .

"When a woman purchased a record at her local thrift store in Colorado she never imagined she'd find a letter written from a soldier in 1944 during World War II to his love back at home to whom he was later married for 63 years. Ilene Ortiz of Westminster bought the old record, though she can't remember which one, six months ago and when she found the letter tucked inside she felt determined to find its rightful owner. 'We brought the album home and we were looking through it, and I said, 'There's a letter in here!'' Ortiz told ABC. Scroll down for video . Young Loves: Bill and Bernadean Moore were married for 63 years and when Bill fought in World War II he sent florid love notes to Bernadean who was a high-school student in Kansas . Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in all my life as I am for you,' concludes the letter . Overcome with emotion: Ilene Ortiz returned the letter to the Gales' daughter Melinda Gale who was amazed by her father's loving words to her mother . 'I thought, ""This is such a romantic letter and someone should have it.""' Ortiz contacted ABC affiliate KMGH for help in finding the relatives of the subjects of the letter and together they located the deceased mother Bernadean and elderly father Bill's  daughter Melinda Gale, 48. Bill and Bernadean were married and moved to Colorado with their three children not far from where the letter was found. 'My darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean,' said the letter, written on December 29, 1944. Gale's parents met when Bill was on furlough and her mother was still in high school in Fredonia, Kansas where the letter was sent. 'I ran out of space, but I could have written a lot more adjectives describing you. You are so lovely, darling, that I often wonder how it is possible that you are mine. I'm really the luckiest guy in the world, you know. And you are the reason, Bernadean. Even your name sounds lovely to me,'said the letter written when Bill was just 20-years-old. Melinda Gale held back tears as she read the touching letter from her father to her mother 70 years ago. Gale's mother died in 2010 but her memory still lives on with the help of letters like this one. She told ABC she never could have imagined her father, a mechanical engineer, would use the flowery and loving language that he did. Gale's parents met when Bill was on furlough and her mother Bernadean (pictured) was still in high school in Fredonia, Kansas where the letter was sent. Tracked down relatives: Ilene Ortiz says when she found the lovely letter in a vintage record that she knew she had to track down the rightful owners . Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you,' reads the letter . 'It's just when I get so horribly, terribly lonely for you that I write letters like this,' the letter continues. 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you.' 'My hands were shaking when I finished reading it,' Gale said emotionally. 'It’s truly was a window into how deep their love was. And obviously, they were married for almost 63 years. We knew they loved each other very, very much, but as children you don’t see that. Where it came from, that deep connection, and this was a window into their story. He was a mechanical engineer. I cannot believe he shared these deep emotional words with her,' she shared. Gale and her history teacher sister always had a fascination with their father's experience in the war and in 2000 took a trip to Europe to retrace his steps. Fought in the war: Melinda Gale said that most of her parents time dating was spent writing letters back and froth to each other when her father was fighting in World War II . True loves: Bill and and Bernadean Moore were married for 63 years up until the time Bernadean died in 2010 . 'Mom had never gotten to see everywhere he had been. We did this amazing trip so I can picture exactly where he was on December 29 of 1944, sitting in this miserable, cold, dark forest in the northern region where France, Germany and Belgium all meet.' Gale told ABC she thinks her mother may have slipped the letter into the record for safe keeping because it was special to her. Even though Ortiz says she can't remember which record she found the letter in, Gale has her own theory. Gale explained that her mother and father's special song was 'I'll be seeing you,' from the Broadway musical Right This Way. Mom’s song for dad was ‘I’ll Be Seeing You,' she said. 'I’m sure it was in there.' 'What a sweet, wonderful Valentines gift to give our family,' Gale said. 'I didn’t get to meet this wonderful lady who found the letter, but I just can’t thank her enough.' Gales plans to give the letter to her father who lives in a veteran's assisted care facility.","Ilene Ortiz of Westminster, Colorado found the love letter in an old record but she can't remember which one .

"Italy's birth rate has dropped to its lowest in more than 150 years amid a sluggish economy. Fewer babies were born in Italy in 2014 than in any other year since the modern Italian state was formed in 1861, new figures have revealed. 2013 European birth rate: The number of live births last year was 509,000 - 5,000 fewer than in 2013 - rounding off half a century of decline . National statistics office ISTAT said the number of live births last year was 509,000 - 5,000 fewer than in 2013 - rounding off half a century of decline. The number of births per 1,000 people is now at 8.4, down from 38.3 150 years ago, according to The Daily Telegraph. Babies born to both natives and foreigners living in Italy dropped as immigration, which used to support the overall birth rate, tumbled to its lowest level for five years. The figures have been released after the Pope branded couples who choose not have children 'selfish' and are part of a 'greedy generation', earlier this week. The pontiff said it was a 'depressed society' that considered offspring to be a weight or a risk. Pope Francis made the remarks in front of a large crowd during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square, Rome. Addressing the crowd, he said life 'rejuvenates' when children arrive and they 'enrich it'. 'A society with a greedy generation, that doesn't want to surround itself with children, that considers them above all worrisome, a weight, a risk, is a depressed society,' he said, the Guardian reported. 'The choice to not have children is selfish. Life rejuvenates and acquires energy when it multiplies: It is enriched, not impoverished.' The Pope previously apologised for offending large Catholic families when he said there was no need to breed 'like rabbits'. He caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'. Speaking during a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines, he said: 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.' Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu apologised on Pope Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'. Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.' According to European statistics website Eurostat's most recent figures, Azerbaijan had the highest birth rate in the EU at a whopping 18.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. Turkey comes in next at 16.8 per 1,000 and Ireland follows closely behind at 15. The UK is close to the top of the list with 12.2 per 1,000. While at the bottom with just 7 per 1,000 people is Portugal after Estonia, Greece, and Italy at 8.5. The mortality rate also declined in Italy last year, stretching life expectancy for Italian men to 80.2 years, and to 84.9 years for women. Developed countries the world over are counting the cost of an ageing population, such as rising pension payouts and healthcare costs, but Italy, now in its third recession in six years, is particularly vulnerable. The government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is scrambling to give the economy a boost by reforming the sclerotic labour market and persuading the country's youth not to migrate and work abroad. The demographic picture varies wildly between Italy's regions, with the autonomous northern area of Trentino-Alto Adige enjoying a total fertility rate of 1.65. The population is shrinking in most of the poorer south, where per-capita gross domestic product is about half that in the centre and north.

"A Reddit theory that Homer has been in a coma for past 20 years has been shot down by The Simpsons' executive producer. Al Jean said that the notion that Homer has been stuck in a coma since the '90s and all the episodes since have been figments of his imagination can be stashed in the 'intriguing but false file'. A Reddit user proposed the theory based on a 1992 episode called Homer the Heretic. Simpsons executive producer Al Jean shot down the theory based on the Homer the Heretic episode (above) Homer ended up in the hospital in an 1993 episode after a prank by Bart on April Fool's Day went wrong . Simpsons executive producer Al Jean told TMZ the coma theory belongs in the 'intriguing but false file' Jean said the theory, and a similar one that claims Bart was killed in an episode that never aired, is false, according to TMZ. He said: 'It would mean back in 1993 we would presume the show was going on for years and years more and right before we left, threw this hidden monkey wrench in for all our successors. 'I'm afraid it goes with the 'Dead Bart' episode in the intriguing but false file.' The Reddit user behind the theory, who posted it nine days ago, offered a response. Hardtopickaname wrote: 'He says it's not true, but what does he know about the Simpsons?' According to the theory, Homer going into space (pictured) was just a figment of his imagination . The theory also explains why celebrities like Sir Richard Branson (above) are always on the show . The Simpsons (Bart, Marge, Lisa, Homer and Maggie, left to right) have been on TV for more than 25 years . In the episode that prompted the coma theory, Homer ponders the meaning of life during a conversation with God. He insists he can't wait until he's dead to find out, to which God says: 'You can't wait six months?' Six months later, in an April 1993 episode title 'So It's Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show', Homer is crushed by a vending machine after an April Fool's prank by Bart and ends up in a coma. At the end of the episode, Homer abruptly awakens from the coma to strangle Bart. Hardtopickaname wrote: 'I propose that Homer didn't actually wake up from his coma. He is still in a vegetative state and every single Simpsons episode afterwards is in Homer's imagination. 'Homer remembers Bart, Lisa, and Maggie as 10, 8, and 1 year old, so they will always appear that way in his dreams.' Reddit user Hardtopickaname''s theory got some traction but was eventually shot down by producer Jean . The theory about Homer being in a coma since 1993 was first posed on Reddit nine days ago . The theory claims the celebrities who routinely appear on the show are simply examples of Homer's imagination running wild. 'The massive amounts of celebrity appearances are easily explained as well. People in comas can sometime hear what people in the same room are saying. While Homer wouldn't physically react, his mind processes that information and includes it in his dreams,' Simpsons creator Matt Groening has yet to comment on the theory,The Huffington Post reported. The Simpsons has broadcast more than 500 episodes since its debut in 1989. It is America's longest-running sitcom and animated show.

Levy, a New York real estate agent who calls herself the 'Billion Dollar Broker', has opened up her listed $18 million Manhattan duplex that she shares with her newlywed husband, her three children ... and her ex. Levy split from her first husband, Chris Lipman - who she married in 1992 and had two daughters, now teenagers - four years ago, and they divorced in 2012. However Lipman - who worked with his now-ex wife at her firm, Carol E.

Levy lives upstairs in the 18th-floor master suite with Goron, and the children are in nearby bedrooms. Suffice to say, it's far from an ideal arrangement . 'There are some times when his presence there, I do feel, is intrusive on my life,' Levy told 20/20. Sprawling: Carol E.

Shared: The strange living situation sees Levy and her family sharing this kitchen with her ex husband . Stunning: The 5,000-square-foot mansion has six bedrooms and plenty of living space . 'If I am in the kitchen and I want to go in there, and he's there ... I would rather be in the kitchen by myself and not, you know, with my ex-husband there.' Levys says she is most frustrated with the way her ex separates his food from hers in the shared kitchen, and his cleanliness. 'He marks his food, each of it, with an X,' Levy said. 'He doesn't clean up after himself, and I do pay for the housekeeper. 'So there is a little resentment there.' The apartment was appraised for $21 million, according to Levy, but she has reduced the price to $18 million to speed up the sale and fix the situation she is in. 'It'll happen soon,' Levy said. 'I would say, within the next few months, there should be a deal on it.'

Family: Levy and Lipman had two daughters during their marriage, who are now teenagers . Goron previously told The New York Post that he has come to accept the arrangement, no matter how awkward. 'I do not allow her ex's presence to affect our incredible happiness in any way whatsoever,' Joel said. 'He's merely a speed bump in the road.' Lipman told the newspaper that he chooses to remain living in the home because it allows to see his daughters each day and he hopes his presence will motivate Levy to push the sale through. The impressive property - which features city views, sweeping terraces, a grand staircase herringbone floors and two wood-burning fireplaces - came onto the market for $24 million .

"This is the shocking moment a 35-year-old man was shot dead by police after allegedly throwing rocks at officers in an incident that has sparked outrage across  the United States and Mexico. Antonio Zambrano-Montes, an orchard worker who was born in Mexico, was caught on a witness's cellphone being gunned down by officers at a busy intersection in Pasco, Washington, on Tuesday. According to police, he had refused to stop hurling rocks - one of which was 'softball-sized' - at officers, despite having struck two of them. An attempt to Taser the man had apparently failed. However, multiple witnesses have argued that Zambrano-Montes - who was not armed with either a gun or a knife - was running away from officers and had his back to them when he was killed at 5pm. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Running away? Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, is captured on witness Dario Infante's cellphone just seconds before he is shot dead by police. He appears to be running away from officers in the Washington city of Pasco . Shooting: The orchard worker, who was born in Mexico, had allegedly been throwing rocks at police. He is pictured turning to face three armed officers as one holds up a flashlight and two others draw their guns . Killed: Zambrano-Montes is seen lying on the ground after he was shot by police at the busy intersection . Grief-stricken: Erika Zambrano holds a photo of her father, Zambrano-Montes, outside the city hall building in Pasco, Washington. His death has sparked protests and has been condemned by Mexico's president . On Friday, the man's family filed a $25 million claim  with the city of Pasco. It came as the president of Mexico reiterated his country's condemnation of the violence against a Mexican citizen. Now, a county coroner in southeastern Washington has declared he will order an inquest into the shooting in a bid to defuse rising tensions within the community, where protests are underway. Franklin County Coroner Dan Blasdel said his decision to proceed with an inquest - which will be open to the public - is intended to calm 'some of the fears and outrage of the community'. On Wednesday, around 100 protesters marched outside Pasco City Hall, with some chanting 'It was only a rock,' according to KEPR. Later that day, more demonstrators gathered at the intersection. And on Saturday, a rally is set to be held at noon at Volunteer Park, situated across from City Hall. After gathering at the park, the protesters plan to hold a vigil fro Zambrano-Montes nearby. 'It's a stressful time for anybody who wears a badge,' said Sgt. Ken Lattin of Kennewick Police, spokesman for a group of outside police agencies investigating the shooting on Tuesday. Protesting: Protesters gather at the corner where the shooting of Zambrano-Montes took place on Thursday . Sign: A man holds a sign reading 'RIP Antonio' following the shooting, which is now  under investigation . Controversy: A meeting is held inside Vinny's Bakery with Pasco police, some family members and community members about the shooting death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, who was an orchard worker . At a news conference on Friday afternoon, Lattin said members of the public have a right to march peacefully in the town of Pasco, an agricultural city of 68,000 people, 215 miles southeast of Seattle. He added that they also have the right to express their opinions on social media. However, he said the public needs to be respectful of other points of view and to each other. He also cautioned against making a decision about the death based purely on the harrowing video, which was filmed on  witness Dario Infante's cellphone and only entered the public domain this week. 'Our constitution allows people to gather and protest. That is perfectly OK,' Lattin said of a march planned for Saturday. 'Be respectful of others, their person, their property.' Memorial: Pasco residents, pictured from left,  Angel Morgan, five, and his brother Jose Morgan, six, and Alex Gonzalez, four, and his brother Angel Gonzalez, eight, gather around a candlelit vigil on February 11 . Scene: Police investigate the scene of the shooting at the intersection of 10th Avenue and Lewis Street . The death of Zambrano-Montes is the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer in Pasco. It has sparked protests after witnesses said he was running away when he was shot in a busy intersection. Witness Ben Patrick told the Tri-City Herald that police fired at the man as his back was turned. 'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or Taser him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.' Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said. Other witnesses heard officers give Zambrano-Montes orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen. Zambrano-Montes, who was raised in Michoacan, Mexico, has lived for about a decade in Pasco, where more than half of the residents are Hispanic. He died of gunshot wounds to the torso. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday reiterated his country's 'condemnation of the disproportionate use of lethal force' by members of the Pasco police against a Mexican citizen. 'I have directed the secretary of foreign relations to support his family so they feel the backing and support of the government of Mexico, so they don't feel alone and so there is a close monitoring of the investigation into this regrettable and outrageous occurrence,' he said at a gathering of members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Mexico City. Zambrano-Montes was not armed with either a gun or a knife, Lattin confirmed at the news conference, but whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation. Paying tribute: Laura Alvarado, who says she knew Zambrano-Montes, lights a candle next to Vinny's Bakery . Detectives are still gathering dash-cam video, evidence from the scene, citizen video and police equipment and will be interviewing at least 40 witnesses. Zambrano-Montes had a run-in with Pasco police early last year, having been arrested for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show. Lattin cautioned the public that the inquiry will take at least weeks and that any decision on whether to bring charges against the three officers involved will be made by the Franklin County prosecutor. 'Rest in peace': Melted candle wax, a rock and roses are part of an impromptu memorial for  Zambrano-Montes on the sidewalk in Pasco, Washington . The officers are on paid administrative leave. 'Those three officers are going to have to live by their decisions,' Lattin said. 'Was it right? That will come out later on.' Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant said it was too early to speculate about what charges potentially could be brought against the officers. The Pasco police department also is conducting an administrative investigation of the shooting and could punish the officers if they find they disobeyed department procedures of policies. Local officials have been in contact with state and federal officials, who are observing the local criminal investigation and decide later whether any further action needs to be taken, Lattin said. Zambrano-Montes' family's $2 million damages claim was filed by his widow and two daughters. It is a precursor to a lawsuit. The city has 60 days to respond. The group conducting the criminal investigation was formed in 2010 to look at any officer-involved criminal cases. This is the eleventh investigation they have conducted since then, Lattin said. In three previous fatal police shootings in Pasco, prosecutors cleared officers with the Pasco Police Department and a sheriff's deputy who was working on a regional SWAT team. One of the three officers involved in Tuesday's shooting was a defendant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit the city settled in 2013 for $100,000, according to court records. The lawsuit claimed Pasco officers were inadequately trained in the use of force and how to respond to street confrontations. Earlier this week, the ACLU of Washington also issued a statement, calling the incident 'very disturbing.' The group's executive director, Kathleen Taylor said: 'Fleeing from police and not following an officer's command should not be sufficient for a person to get shot,' She added deadly force should be used only as a last resort .","Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, shot dead by police on Tuesday evening .

"The death of a medical school graduate from the Bahamas while in police custody in New London, Connecticut, has been ruled a homicide, but authorities say that doesn't mean the officers committed any crime. The Day newspaper reports the chief medical examiner's office ruled recently the October death of 31-year-old Lashano Gilbert was a homicide caused by a fight with police that led to complications with what appeared to be a sickle cell disease condition. Police say Gilbert was arrested for an attempted carjacking and died after fighting with officers and being zapped with a stun gun twice within eight hours. Homicide: The chief medical examiner's office ruled recently the October death of 31-year-old Lashano Gilbert was a homicide death complicated by a sickle cell anemia condition . Officers first subdued the 31-year-old when his arrest turned to a struggle. They did so again when he attacked officers in the police station. State police are still investigating Gilbert's death. Gilbert reportedly told police he was hearing voices and when he behaved in a threatening manner toward them, they used the stun gun. He was taken to a hospital and treated, then taken to a New London police station. Police say while in a holding cell Gilbert began twisting his pants as if to make a noose. He bum rushed police when they opened the cell to take the pants. In the commotion, Gilbert was tasered a second time. He was rushed to the hospital again and died around 3:30am Saturday. New London's state's attorney and New London police chief immediately asked the state police to start an investigation, according to NBC Connecticut. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sickle cell is an inherited red blood cell disorder which can block blood flow and cause pain and other serious problems such infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke. Violent arrest: Police say Lashano Gilbert was arrested for an attempted carjacking and died after fighting with officers and being zapped with a stun gun twice within eight hours . Gilbert’s cousin, Kasi Fletcher told The Day that the family is struggling with the news.'It’s hard to hold back the emotions with something like this,” Fletcher said. “We’re all still pretty much in shock. We passed the word along to (Gilbert’s) mother. She just wants justice.” Fletcher said the family has heard very little in the way of remorse from town officials or police about Gilbert’s death. 'Not a word,' Fletcher said. 'Crickets.' The homicide ruling means Gilbert's death was at least in part caused by another person. Gilbert's family says it learned about the results last week. Local police union President Todd Lynch said Friday officers have been  criticized for simply doing their jobs. 'There are some situations that our officers must respond to,' Lynch said. 'We cannot run away. We cannot call anyone else for assistance. We have to act. No matter what color, creed, sexual orientation, religion, anything. That’s what our officers did that night.' 'None of those officers involved wanted to go home that night thinking their actions caused the death of someone. Nobody wants this to happen,' Lynch said. Possible mental disorder: Lashano Gilbert reportedly told police he was hearing voices and when he behaved in a threatening manner toward them, they used the stun gun .","The October death of 31-year-old Lashano Gilbert was a homicide caused by a fight with police that led to complications with a sickle cell condition .

"A newlywed died in her husband's arms during a honeymoon scuba diving trip in the Caribbean. Lindsey and John McFadden, from Minnesota, were scuba diving when something suddenly went horribly wrong. When Lindsey, who was 31 and an experienced diver, reached the surface she told her husband 'I feel sick'. Lindsey McFadden, pictured here just days before her death, was only 31 when she died in her husband John's arms after  scuba diving on their honeymoon. She had suffered an internal bleed in her liver . The Minnesota couple first met in 2013 after a mutual friend recommended John, a self-employed handyman, to Lindsey for home repair work. Lindsey was in a relationship and they started out as friends . Those were her last words. Mere seconds later she died in John's arms. It was a tragic end to a slow-burning romance, one John describes as the 'best short story ever.' The couple first met in August 2013 after a mutual friend recommended John, a self-employed handyman, to Lindsey for repair work. After the meeting they both called their friend to find out more about the other person, admitting they had a crush. John, 51, had liked that Lindsey, a dialysis nurse, 'came prepared with a ladder strapped to the top of her car,' he wrote on lindseymcfadden.com, a blog he keeps in remembrance of his wife. But the first chapter in the couple's story was friendship - Lindsey was already in a relationship. And both had already decided their 20-year age gap was too large an obstacle. The future couple reunited seven months later when Lindsey asked John to take a look at a bathroom she was hoping to remodel. The couple, pictured here on their wedding day, were also daunted by a 20-year age gap. But after Lindsey broke up with her boyfriend, John finally asked her on a date - and proposed 18 days later . John's work partner noticed that Lindsey's eyes were puffy and asked if she was okay. 'Lindsey replied she had just that day broken off a romantic relationship and even though she had know for a while it wasn't what she wanted she was still hurt over it ending,' John wrote on his blog. 'She said she debated on canceling our meeting but had determined that moving forward was how she planned to live her life now so what better time to meet us.' Inspired by her 'logic and vulnerability,' and ecstatic that she was single, John told his friend he was going to 'make a run for this girl'. His friend's response? 'A man can always dream'. But just as a repair had first brought the two to meet, it would also be the occasion to bring them together. John realized the bathroom repair would be an 'incredible opportunity to break the mold of dating,' he told TwinCities.com. Barely a month after John proposed the couple exchanged vows, a decision they made just that day . He asked Lindsey if she wanted to 'sweat-equity this project', meaning she would pay for the repair not with money, but by working with John side-by-side. John said he knew the approach would would 'give us a lot of time together'. And it did. For months the two worked to transform a bathroom filled with rusty metal, a rotted window, and a tiny, terrible tub. When they weren't working, the friends were eating plenty of meals together. But after the project was over, John was ready to end the friendship - and hopefully begin a relationship - with another invitation to dinner, which ended with a kiss. John wanted to skip a few chapters and make up for lost time. 'I asked her to marry me 18 days later,' he said. But even the wedding date set for five months later turned out to be too long of a wait. During a trip to visit his family, a month after the proposal, John found Lindsey writing something in the kitchen. 'On the top of the page it said, ""Pros"" and ""Cons"". I said, ""Baby, what's this list about?"" 'She said, ""I'm making a pro/con list of us getting married today."" 'I looked up and my mom and my niece were beaming. I said, ""Forget the list, let's vote.""' By 4.30pm that day, with three guests and a bridal bouquet from Whole Foods, they were married in John's parents front yard. The marriage stayed secret and the couple went on with their October wedding as planned before jetting off about a month later for their honeymoon in Cozumel, Mexico. It was there Lindsey died, from what turned out to be an internal bleed in her liver. The couple had only been married 168 days. The couple went ahead with the ceremony they had already scheduled for five months later, keeping their early wedding a secret. They were married 168 days before Lindsey passed away .","Lindsey McFadden was 31 when she died from internal bleeding in her liver .

"Ukip has accused Channel 4 of peddling 'liberal-Left poppycock' over an apocalyptic portrayal of what British life would be like if Nigel Farage became Prime Minister. The row has blown up over a drama-documentary to be screened at tomorrow which imagines life under a Farage government. In Ukip: The First Hundred Days – which mixes acted scenes with real news footage – border guards are seen forcibly repatriating illegal immigrants amid race riots, as the UK prepares to pull out of the European Union. The film shows Ukip winning a slim majority in May's Election, but within three months, society is on the brink of collapse under Mr Farage's Right-wing policies. Scroll down for video . Panic: Ukip has hit back at Channel 4's new drama-documentary which shows British society on the brink of collapse, three months after Ukip (leader Nigel Farage pictured) wins the 2015 general election . Weaved into the plot are references to some of the many racism and sexism scandals which have hit the party in recent years. Last night, one aide close to the Ukip leader hit back, telling The Mail on Sunday: 'This is typical of the poppycock peddled by the public-school educated Lefties who run Channel 4 and large chunks of the media. 'The idea that this is what would happen is simply preposterous, but it shows that we have got the liberal establishment quaking. 'Bring it on, we say, because this sort of thing simply serves to boost our ratings.' The film is seen from the perspective of a fictional Ukip MP, Deepa Kaur, the only female Asian in the Parliamentary Party, who is asked to defend policies such as raids on businesses suspected of harbouring immigrants. Kaur, played by Priyanga Burford, is tipped for a Cabinet post but faces furious demonstrations when the largest employer in her constituency is put out of business by Farage's decision to pull Britain out of the EU. She then decides she has been 'used' by Farage, and condemns the raids as 'aggressive and un-British'. Disaster: A scene from new docu-drama 'Ukip: The First 100 Days' (pictured) suggests a UKIP government would lead to riots in the streets and the loss of millions of jobs after the UK leaves the EU . Fantasy: A scene from the drama. Many scenes play out in a post-cigarette-ban world of smoky pubs . The provocative scenes play out against the backdrop of smoky pubs because Farage has lifted the smoking ban. Archive footage is used to portray Mr Farage, his Deputy Prime Minister – former Tory MP Neil Hamilton – and Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, who is seen repeating his infamous remark about Africa being 'bongo bongo land'. Mr Farage was initially invited to discuss the scenario in a Channel 4 interview with Jeremy Paxman, but negotiations broke down. Nick Mirsky, Channel 4's head of documentaries, denied that the film, which airs ay 9pm, was 'anti-Ukip', but admitted that it did not have to be 'politically balanced' because was being shown outside of the official Election campaign period, which starts on March 30. He said: 'Our job is to reflect and explore contemporary British life. Nothing represents what's different and unique in British political life now more than the rise of Ukip. 'This might be what you wake up to after May 7.'","Row over Channel 4's drama-documentary, 'Ukip: The First Hundred Days'

"This footage exposes the Chinese fur farms where a distant relation to dogs are skinned alive en-masse and turned into luxury coats sold in the West. Animal rights activists smuggled secret cameras into farms and markets near Beijing, where they spent three weeks pretending to be potential business partners from Europe. There they filmed  the industrial scale of fur farming, a practice banned in Britain 14 years ago but largely unrestricted in many other countries including China. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Caged: This raccoon dog is one of hundreds held at a Chinese fur farm, where they live just a few months . Footage: Two farms near Beijing were filmed by animal activists concerned at China's lack of restrictions . Lively trade: The majority of fur farming still happens in Europe, but newly-rich China is expanding rapidly . Raccoon dogs are a type of canine but the breed is described as 'Asiatic raccoon' on luxury coat labels, partly due to off-putting comparisons with domestic pets. The activists claim the animals they saw on the two farms, each holding 300 or 400 raccoon dogs, were confined to faeces-filled cages barely larger than their bodies. Dead raccoon dogs were fed to those still alive, the activists claimed, and almost every animal showed signs of 'mental or physical illness'. One secretly-shot section of their footage showed multiple raccoon dogs crammed into single cages and one with a wound to its leg. Another showed the grisly death of a raccoon dog at a sprawling open-air fur market, where it was stunned by two electrified metal rods hooked up to a truck engine's battery. Horror: The most chilling scene shot by the activists was the live skinning of a raccoon dog at a fur market . Torn limb from limb: A grinning worker stunned the animal with the current from the truck's battery . A grinning worker then demonstrated how to skin the animal to a watching crowd, ripping off its pelt around its head with half a dozen forceful tugs while its legs remained hooked to the back of a truck. The two activists behind the footage were part of the campaign group Animal Equality based in Los Angeles, California. Founder Jose Valle, one of the two undercover activists who infiltrated the farms, told MailOnline the consequences could have been dire if he was caught. Describing the farm, he said: 'There was a stench coming from the cages. The animals had no access to water and when they were skinned, the corpses were left lying in the open air. 'Several of them showed clear signs of psychological stress and suffered stereotypical behaviour such as pacing, biting bars and self-mutilation. 'Most of the animals were killed at the farm and skinned. Many times the bodies were then fed to other animals. 'The majority are killed when they are a few months old but others are kept for breeding. Some of these animals spend four or five years in a tiny cage going round in circles going crazy.' Aware: Undercover activist Jose Valle said he and his colleague, from California, could not be found out . 'Most of the animals were skinned at the farm,' Mr Valle said. 'Many times, bodies were fed to other animals' Mr Valle said seeing an animal skinned alive at a market was the most harrowing moment - and the most nerve-wracking for him personally. 'He brought us into this small circle where we were the only western people, so immediately they were suspicious,' he said. 'But because we were with a very well-known fur trader they allowed us to be there. What they didn't know was that we had a hidden camera. 'He told us he was selling all over the world, including Europe, and he has several customers in Europe and the U.S.' Mr Valle added: 'They know there's a growing outrage against the cruelty of the fur trade, so as westerners it's difficult for us to access these places. They know animal activists are interested so they're reluctant to say much to outsiders. 'They showed us everything because we appealed to them as business people and they thought we were going to do business. Breeds: The farm also had foxes bred for their fur, with many crammed together into one cage . Uncomfortable: Other animals were in cages propped up on bricks, barely larger than their bodies . Cramped: This animal at one of the two fur farms was barely able to turn around. Many had signs of stress . 'On a couple of occasions in the market it felt dangerous. When we were coming back in the car with the fur farmer he asked us if we were journalists. 'One activist ended up in a car chase when he tried to film a fur market. He was taken to the police station and they confiscated the tapes of what he filmed there.' The organisation is  calling for more countries to ban or impose stricter welfare laws on fur farming, which has boomed in China amid the rise of the newly-rich. China is now the world's biggest importer of fur despite  already producing a quarter of the world's pelts, according to the International Fur Trade Federation. A U.S. report in 2010 said 30million mink, 25million foxes and 15million raccoon dogs were set to be slaughtered for fashion in China that year - up 15million on the year before. It added most of the country's fur farms - most of which have been built since 1995 - were small family firms, making it harder to carry out checks on the number of animals or their welfare. Europe remains by far the biggest fur farming region, producing 60 per cent of the world's supply. Grisly: Mr Valle said there was a 'stench' at the farm as skinned carcasses were left in the open air . Wounds: Raccoon dogs which were kept to breed could live on the farms self-mutilating for several years . Defeat: Fur farming was banned in Britain in 2000, but is widespread in China alongside Norway and Spain . But activists have shone a spotlight on China because of its rapid expansion and lack of welfare laws. 'I think it can be as bad as in other countries, but in China there are no particular laws,' Mr Valle said. 'So even if you film cruelty there's nothing you can do about it. 'I've also been in fur farms in Norway, Finland and Spain and found animals that are mutilated and cannibalising each other.' Fur farming was banned in Britain in 2000 amid a public outcry, and the country's last remaining mink farmers were paid compensation by the government. A year later Britain banned imports of dog and cat fur, in response to a two-year RSPCA campaign which tugged public heartstrings with images from the film 101 Dalmatians. Raccoon dogs do not come under the legislation because the animals are so distantly related to domestic pets. Many U.S. websites list coats and collars made from Chinese 'Asiatic raccoon', and the use of the name means buyers do not always realise they are buying the fur of canines. Mr Valle's colleague Sharon Nunez said: 'These furs are shipped to countries across the globe. They line coats at stores throughout the U.S.' The chief executive of the industry's International Fur Federation, former Liberal Democrat MP Mark Oaten, said skinning alive was 'completely unacceptable and impractical'. 'I know of no one in the fur business who would do that,' he said. 'I promise that if anybody has real and factual evidence with names and locations [...] I will bring that to the attention of the relevant authorities so that they can prosecute those involved.' A statement by two of the IFF's leading Chinese members - who were not implicated in the farms shown in these images - also said skinning alive was 'abhorrent'.","Animal rights activists infiltrated two farms and market near Beijing .

"A Facebook rant allegedly posted online by a South Australian doctor charged with murdering his wife while on holiday in Tasmania has revealed his anguish over her affair. Robin Michael, 63, is believed to have posted the lengthy accusation early on Thursday morning, an action which prompted his wife's family to contact police out of concern for her safety. In the post he hints that his wife may have been having an affair with one of his close friends. 'I have taught (his friend) everything I could, I have encouraged him, promoted him to others and protected him when required,' he allegedly wrote. 'So why would he think he has the right to engage in an affair with someone that he knows is the centre of my life.' Scroll down for video . Robin Michael, 63, (left) has been charged with the murder of his wife Kerry Michael, 44 (right) The post continued, with Mr Michael spilling out his heart for all his Facebook friends and family to see. 'I hold her at night and there is no drug that would deliver that same sensation to me ... I thought she was my life partner and would never do me wrong. She is my heartbeat,' he wrote. However, speaking to Adelaide Now, Mrs Michael's son, Nathan Heanes-Cahill, said he refused to believe Michael's claims that his mother had an affair and said his mother and Mr Michael appeared to have the perfect relationship. 'I am as close as anyone to Mum and that was news to me,' he said. Mrs Michael's body was found on Mount Roland in Tasmania . 'That Facebook post was the first thing that brought it to me, from what I believe and what their relationship was like, I don't believe it,' he said. 'They did a lot of things together and I guess Mum is lucky because a lot of the things she got to do she wouldn't have done without Robin. They travelled a lot together,' he said. Kerry Michael's sister Tracey Heanes said that the family knew 'that it wasn't in character and then they rang the police straight away and that's why it was immediately dealt with'. 'As soon as that post went on Facebook we were on our way over because we knew that something obviously was wrong,' she told the newspaper. Ms Michael's family said that the 44-year-old was a very loyal and funny person, and was well-like by so many friends. The couple were on a holiday in Tasmania and police reported they had gone for a walk up Mount Roland . She was 'just the life of the party and always there for her family and friends and completely devoted to her son,' said Ms Heanes. Ms Michael's family is understood to be struggling with the news of her death after her body was discovered on a 1,200 metre mountain in Tasmania on Thursday. The couple had been on holidays in Tasmania where they had been travelling for several weeks, when her body was discovered near the summit of Mount Roland, in the state's northwest. The pair are believed to have gone for a walk on the mountain, near the town of Sheffield, before her body was discovered 200 metres from the top of the mountain at approximately 2pm. An air search was launched by authorities, who said Ms Michael had suffered trauma injuries. 'There's some contact between family members that created concern for her welfare that led us to this area,' said Inspector Kim Steven. 'I believe there were some social media interaction that raised those concerns,' he told The ABC. Tasmanian police confirmed on Friday that Mr Michael, a health administrator with nearly 30 years experience, had been charged with the death of his wife. Ms Michael was reported missing by concerned family members after Mr Michael posted strange comments . Mr Michael was apprehended at the caravan park they had been staying at with believed self-inflicted wounds . He was arrested at the East Devonport caravan park and was taken into custody after being treated in hospital. 'We know they went for a day walk on Wednesday morning and that the woman was killed that day,' Inspector Stevens told Adelaide Now. 'While a man is in custody, we still need to build an exact picture of what took place and are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area to come forward.' He was silent at a hearing in Davenport on Friday, appearing before a magistrate in blue overalls with no shoes on his feet and a cut on his face, which is believed to be self-inflicted. Mr Michaels did not enter a plea, and will reappear on Tuesday. He has been refused bail. Kerry Michael's body was discovered on a 1,200 metre mountain in Tasmania on Thursday . The 63-year-old had returned to Adelaide in 2007 as the chief executive at Radiology Resources Pty Ltd after serving as the general manager Royal Darwin Hospital. He has also worked with the South Australian Department of Human Services, where he acted as the executive director. Forensic evidence has been gathered by police who were transported to the mountain by helicopter. The couple's camper van, which they had been travelling in for several weeks, was examined by authorities.

"Elegantly decorated and lit with twinkling chandeliers, these sumptuous interiors wouldn't look out of place in the most exclusive of London homes. But  this townhouse, from scullery to top-floor boudoir, stands at just over 4ft tall - and every step, door and window has been built in miniature. Modelled on a Regency property from 1815, this very grown-up dolls' house is the handiwork of Tim and Angela Hartnell, who charge customers upwards of £4,000 for one of their miniature masterpieces. Welcoming: The dining room  opens out onto the entrance hall through double doors. A separete servants' door can be seen in the corner . Lavish: Guests would be led into the home through the entrance hall, above, before being taken to the reception rooms upstairs . Intimate: An elegant crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling of the second-floor drawing room, pictured, which is stocked with books . Miniature masterpiece: The exterior of the Kensington house (pictured) features railings that separate the townhouse from the pavement . The couple, from Norfolk, spend weeks carefully constructing, painting and finishing each home that they make. And their attention to detail is paying off - the waiting list for one of their made-to-order creations is more than a year. Mr Hartnell, a former software developer, quit his job in 2008 to focus full-time on his passion for dolls houses. His wife, Angela, left her position as a librarian earlier this year to begin working for their company, Anglia Dolls Houses, full-time. Mr Hartnell focuses on building the main form of the dolls house - measuring and carving the birch plywood to each customer's specification - while his wife specialises in painting, decorating and marbling the homes. The Hartnells have a series of standard designs that they then adapt to suit each individual client - offering bedrooms, attics and wine cellars as optional extras. For the paint, the couple use Farrow and Ball colours as they are 'consistent' and easy to find - wherever in the world the house ends up. Mrs Hartnell said that, while her husband has had no formal training, his work makes the most of his 'extreme eye for detail'. Detailed: The four-storey home, pictured, has been built so that each room can be accessed through a logical series of doors and corridors . This attention to every finishing touch and final flourish is what sets their work apart from others who construct these miniature homes, she added. Mrs Hartnell told MailOnline: 'He always tries to get over the feeling of it being a real house. With them you have always got room behind rooms. ‘You can see how it all works together. That is one of the things that Tim always does, he gets the rooms behind the rooms.’ In the Kensington house, for example, the Hartnells needed to consider the need for domestic staff, because that is what homeowners of the time would have been thinking about. It means that running behind each of the elegant reception rooms is a servants' corridor - accessed through concealed 'jib' doors - that all lead down to the scullery and kitchen. Retreat: The study has been finished by Mrs Hartnell with thoughtful flourishes, such as the hourglass  placed on the fireplace . Hidden from view: The scullery (pictured left) can be accessed by servants without walking through the main rooms of the house . Finishing touches: Flickering light fixtures on the back wall bring warmth into the basement kitchen of the Kensington House, pictured . Authentic: A panelled library, like the one pictured above, can be added to any dolls house as a collectors upgrade for an extra cost . Bespoke: For the Kensington model, pictured above, the Hartnells added a side portico (seen on the right) which sits above a wine cellar . Looking at the designs, it is clear that Mr and Mrs Hartnell carefully considered how a visitor to the home would move through the space. Each room is accessed through a logical series of doors and corridors - and each staircase has been placed in a realistic position. Even the flickering fireplaces -  included as part of the standard package - align with chimney breasts and chimney stacks. Another subtle touch that adds to the 'realness' of the pieces is the  proportions of the rooms. It means, as Mrs Hartnell explains, that any miniature furniture that their customers buy fit in the space without throwing out the sense of scale - which is 1/12. The grandness of their rooms can be viewed by pulling the house open from the front or the side panels. Mrs Hartnell said: ‘You get these magical views. It is not just a set of pigeon holes like some dolls houses can be. That is very much Tim’s thing. That is not common at all. But despite the accuracy, Mrs Hartnell said that they are designed to be 'played with' and not to be used as 'architectural models'. Though she admits that those enjoying their works are usually adult collectors - not children. 'Ready to move in': Staff call bells, attached to bell pulls in various rooms of the house, hang on one of the walls in the basement . Perspective: These views along the corridors  reveal how the drawing room (left) and dining room (right) are seen from different angles . Depth: This view shows what the ground floor of the house looks like through the double French doors on the side portico, an added extra .","Tim and Angela Hartnell, from Norfolk, spend weeks carving, painting and marbling each made-to-order dolls house .

"The teenager whose photo went viral after he was caught on camera  getting help from a Target employee before a job interview just received some very good news - he got the job. Yasir Moore, 15, was helped to tie a tie by Dennis Roberts, an employee at the Target in Raleigh, North Carolina and was given a pep talk for his job interview at a Chick-Fil-A fast-food restaurant. And it looks like the employee's act of kindness worked because the fast food chain officially hired him on Friday. You're hired! Moore successfully completed a three interview hiring process with Chic-Fil-A and was hired on Friday . Heartwarming: A shopper at a Raleigh, North Carolina Target took this picture last week of employee Dennis Roberts helping a young man learn to tie a tie for a job interview at a nearby Chick Fil-A . Moore successfully completed a three interview hiring process with Chic-Fil-A and news of his job was posted to Twitter on the company's page. The teenager now plans to show his appreciation to those who helped him by spending part of his first paycheck on a gift to express his thanks. The photo of the ambitious teenager was posted online and quickly gained a lot of attention for the simple act of kindness that was on display. The picture went viral but he later found out about it at school. 'After I heard it went viral, I was in shock, I was amazed,' he told ABC11. 'It's one of the best things that ever happened to me.' Moore even returned to the store to thank the employees for their extraordinary customer service.

'They could have just sold my son a tie,' said Najirah Parrish. 'But they took the time, helped him tie the tie and talked to him. They treated my son with dignity, respect.' They also gave him real world advice to help him get a job. 'I did step-by-step what he told me,' Moore said. Life coach! The folks at Target say they do this kind of thing every day. It's just that this time someone got a picture of it . Roberts' coworker Cathy Scott was the first to greet the customer on Wednesday when he came in looking for a clip-on tie for his interview. Since the store was out of the clip-on ties, she directed him to the regular ties but he didn't know how to tie it. After checking out, Scott brought the boy back to her co-worker Roberts. 'Cathy says, 'Can you tie a tie?' I said, 'Yes,'' Roberts told WTVD. 'We took the wrapping off it, and I tied it on my neck, and fit it over head adjusted it and tightened it...fixed all his collar buttons and he was set to go.' Roberts then went on to help the young man prepare for his job interview by asking him the typical questions a hiring manager would ask. 'We said, 'Make sure you look him in the eye.' I'm saying make sure you give him a firm handshake, and she showed him... he tucked his shirt in,' said Roberts. Scene: Above, the Raleigh, North Carolina Super Target where the kind act happened last Wednesday . It was when he was giving the young man advice that Mark snapped her now-viral photo. 'It was a very quiet simple moment, but it was very profound honestly kindness... from strangers... in a Super Target,' Mark, a mother of three, said. 'He leaves and all these Target employees are screaming 'Bye! Good luck! Tell us how it went.'' The young man left the store as Roberts and the other employees wished him good luck and asked him to come back and tell them how it went. 'We were just here to help a young man get a job and forward his future,' Roberts said. 'When he told me all this advice, I got my confidence back,' said Moore. 'And so when I went for my interview I was calm, cool, and collected.' 'You usually see friends or family help you do that kind of stuff, not just strangers you've never met before,' he said.","Yasir Moore has successfully completed the hiring process with Chic-Fil-A .

"The son of movie star Jackie Chan has apologised and begged the public for a second chance following his release from a six-month jail sentence for allowing people to use marijuana in his apartment. Jaycee Chan, 32, said at a news conference in Beijing that he was rededicating himself to his family and entertainment business career. Chan, who like his father has worked as an actor and singer, said he wanted to apologise for his mistakes and was ashamed. He said he had 'no reason, no excuse' for the behavior that led to his arrest in August alongside Taiwanese actor Ko Kai and others. Scroll down for video . Jaycee Chan apologised for his behaviour after he appeared at a news conference about drug offences . 'After this correction by the justice system, I have changed my outlook on life and my values,' Jaycee said. He and Ko both tested positive for marijuana and police seized more than 100 grams of the drug from Jaycee's Beijing apartment. He could have been sentenced to up to three years, but was shown leniency by the court for having come clean with his law breaking. Chan's news conference was broadcast live on Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, illustrating the propaganda value Beijing hopes to gain from the high-profile case amid a sweeping anti-drugs crackdown. 'I made mistakes, I will remember this lesson, I won't commit mistakes again in the future,' he said in Beijing. 'I want to apologise to everyone for my mistakes. I'm genuinely sorry.' Jaycee Chan's arrest caused embarrassment for his father Jackie Chan (left),  an anti-drugs campaigner . Experts say the arrests are part of a wider campaign by Beijing to promote morality. Chinese authorities have also targeted prostitution and the broader illegal drugs trade over the past year. In the first half of last year, there was a 53 per cent rise in drug investigations in Beijing to more than 1,800 cases. Jaycee, whose mother is former Taiwanese actress Lin Feng-jiao, was raised in Los Angeles and has appeared in about 20 films, most of them low-budget Hong Kong and mainland Chinese productions. His father, known for his leading roles in Rush Hour and Shanghai Knights, has publicly apologised for his son's drug use and pledged to work with him on his recovery. The actor and son of Jackie Chan said he realised he had not been a good role model as he apologised .

His father, known for his leading roles in Rush Hour and Shanghai Knights, has publicly apologised for his son's drug use and pledged to work with him on his recovery. The incident was sensitive for Jackie because of his status as a Chinese anti-drugs ambassador and deputy to the national legislature's main consultative body. Jaycee said his father did not intervene on his behalf and that he received no special treatment in prison, where conditions were 'quite harsh'. Jackie Chan (right) has also publicly apologised for his son, Jaycee Chan's (left) drug use . Jackie Chan, known for his leading roles in Rush Hour and Shanghai Knights (pictured), has publicly apologised for his son's drug use and pledged to work with him on his recovery. Speaking slowly in a quiet voice, he said he'd first encountered marijuana eight years earlier on a trip to the Netherlands, but only became a regular user about two years ago. 'I'm very ashamed that I haven't been a good role model,' he said. 'I want to start again, but I know that it's the mass media that will decide.' Jaycee's arrest put his entertainment career in jeopardy, with several Chinese management companies saying they would refuse to employ celebrities caught using drugs. While professing his love for show business, Jaycee said he was now focused on spending time with his parents over next week's Lunar New Year holiday.","Jaycee Chan, 32, apologised to the public following his release from prison .

"Former President Bill Clinton has apologized to Mexico during a speech in which he suggests that the U.S. war on drugs has been responsible for fueling escalating violence. Clinton spoke at the Laureate Summit on Youth and Productivity in Mexico where he told the audience that the war had backfired and led to violence which is crippling the country. He said: 'I wish you had no narco-trafficking, but it's not really your fault. Basically, we did too good of a job of taking the transportation out of the air and water, and so we ran it over land. I apologize for that.' Apology: In a speech at the Laureate Summit on Youth and Productivity in Mexico Clinton told the audience that the war had backfired and has led to an escalation in violence which is crippling the country . Policies: Ronald Reagan is pictured during a news conference at the White House in March 1987. The Clinton administration took on old drugs policies enacted by his predecessors Reagan and George H.W. Bush . Drug war: In 1989, President George H.W. Bush's doubled annual drug-war spending to $12 billion and committed the military to fighting the cause . The Clinton administration took on old drugs policies enacted by his predecessors, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, according to The Huntington Post. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush doubled his annual drug-war spending to $12 billion and committed the military to the cause. Meanwhile efforts were made to shut down the Caribbean Sea as the favored trafficking route between the U.S. and South America and Central America. But it is this effort which pushed smuggling west, over land in Mexico. In addition, Clinton's administration opened Mexico's border with the U.S. which encouraged land-based trafficking, and enforcement efforts that broke up Colombian cartels. This empowered Mexican drug gangs, who increased in power although they had largely been middle men. Gruesome murder: The 43 students who went missing, DNA tests were able to only positively identify the remains of one of the students, which leaves little hope of finding the remaining missing students, pictured . Demonstration: People take part in a demonstration against the handling of the 43 missing students from Ayotzinapa in Acapulco, Guerrrero state, Mexico on February 10, 2015 . Protests: Riot police, pictured, walk past a burning patrol vehicle during a protest in January, last year, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico issued a security message warning U.S. citizens to avoid Acapulco . However as the money flowed in it's led to horrific acts of violence. At present, the U.S. government spends roughly $40 billion to $50 billion each year fighting the war on drugs around the world. The battle has taken a particularly devastating toll in Mexico. Over the past few years, at least 60,000 to 100,000 people are believed to have been murdered in Mexico, many in drug-related violence. There are estimated to be two murders a day, horrific kidnappings and no-go areas in some parts of the country where the police can struggle to maintain order. Mexico's half-dozen powerful and violent cartels carry out breathtakingly gruesome kidnappings and violence against rivals. Citizens continually voice their concern over the high level of violence among the cartels and  corruption within the government. This has, once again, come to the fore since 43 missing students from rural Mexico were ruled to have been killed and incinerated after being seized by state law enforcement. Parents of the college students have angrily rejected the Mexican attorney general's declaration that their children were murdered. They say that there is a cover up in an attempt to resolve the situation quickly. Last year, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico issued a security warning to U.S. citizens to avoid the Pacific resort of Acapulco because of the violence and protests over the students disappearance. Over the past few years, at least 60,000 to 100,000 people are believed to have been murdered in Mexico, many in drug-related violence. And despite the U.S. war on drugs, 90 percent of the cocaine that arrives in America travels through Mexico and Central America, according to a recent State Department report. Cartels also continue to deliver a significant amount of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the U.S.","Bill Clinton  spoke at a summit on Youth and Productivity in Mexico .

"This is the dramatic moment a woman jumped through a window and grabbed hold of the steering wheel of a bus after the driver lay unconscious. Shannon Ivey gained control of the runaway school bus after  the unresponsive driver, Aubrey Liverpool, 62, began groaning and was slumped over at the controls. Ivey, along with other good Samaritans staged the incredible rescue at the intersection of 56th Street and Busch Boulevard, in Florida after Liverpool lost control of the empty bus and hit a truck. Scroll down for video . Control: Shannon Ivey gained control of the runaway bus after the unresponsive driver, Aubrey Liverpool, 62, began groaning and lay motionless at the controls . Assistance: Ivey opened the folding door while the bus was moving, allowing two men outside to come and help the bus driver . Help: A man unbuckles Liverpool's seatbelt during the incredible rescue at the intersection of 56th Street and Busch Boulevard, in Florida . The mom's quick reactions were caught on surveillance footage and are being credited with preventing the accident from becoming much worst. According to Fox 13, Ivey was travelling five cars behind the bus and caught sight of someone banging on the vehicle's door. The driver of the truck that had just been hit by the bus had gotten out of his vehicle to talk to Liverpool, but could not get his attention. He spotted Liverpool slumped down in his chair and groaning inside the bus. Ivey said: 'The light turned green, everybody started going, just kind of going around [the accident]. We saw a gentleman banging on the bus door.' Kenneth Pierce, Ivey's fiancé, told the TV station: 'It's like a gut feeling. I don't know how to describe it too much. (I just thought) 'Get this guy out. Help him.' The truck driver yelled at the other drivers for help.

'His tongue was sticking out' Recovery: The rescuers stayed with Liverpool until an ambulance arrived. He was released from the hospital on Friday afternoon and is expected to recover . 'He was basically screaming 'Help! Call 911!'' said Pierce who was in the car with her and their eighth grade son Aaron.

"Utah is one step closer to once again using firing squads to carry out executions after a highly-contested proposal passed a key vote in the state's Legislature. Before the vote ultimately passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives by a 39-34 margin yesterday morning, three missing lawmakers were summoned to break a tie. The state voted to stop allowing prisoners to choose death by firing squad in 2004. Scroll down for video . Yesterday Utah lawmakers voted in favor of a proposal that would resurrect the use of firing squads . Rep. Paul Ray (right) and Rep. Curtis Oda (left) celebrate after the vote passed n the state's Legislature . The United States Army used firing squads to execute German prisoners during the second World War . The proposal still has an uncertain fate in the state's GOP-controlled Senate. Leaders in that chamber have thus far declined to say if they'll support it, and Utah's Republican Gov. Gary Herbert won't say if he's in favor of the measure. Republican Senate President Wayne Niederhauser declined to tell reporters  if he'd support it. Rep. Paul Ray is sponsoring the measure. He said: 'It is never easy to talk about taking another life, but in our judicial system we have a means that requires that sometimes. 'We have to have an option.' He added, according to USA TODAY: . 'If we go hanging, if we go to the guillotine, or we go to the firing squad, electric chair, you're still going to have the same circus atmosphere behind it. 'So is it really going to matter?' The Utah execution chamber was shot up after prisoner Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in 2010 . Republican Rep. Paul Ray said: ''It is never easy to talk about taking another life, but in our judicial system we have a means that requires that sometimes' This is the firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah. The state voted to stop allowing prisoners to pick death by firing squad in 2004 . Lawmakers initially voted 35-35 on the proposal Friday morning. After the tie, the three missing lawmakers were summoned to the floor, where they all voted in favor. During that time, Riverton Republican Rep. Dan McCay switched to vote in favor. A firing squad was last used in the state in 2010 when Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles. For years, states have used a three-drug combination to execute inmates. European drug makers are now refusing to sell the drugs to prisons and corrections departments out of opposition to the death penalty.

"A surfer, who was attacked by two great white sharks as he attempted to catch a wave, has revealed the incredible survival story in which he lost both of his arms. Sean Pollard was surfing at a remote beach near Esperance in Western Australia in October last year when he felt what he described as a 'massive bump'. After first taking a bite out of his board and then taking a second chunk out of his leg, the shark went for his arms. 'I was trying to paddle calmly so I wasn't splashing around like I was panicking, but once it got directly behind me it charged through the water. That's when it really went in for the for the kill,' Mr Pollard told Channel Nine's 60 Minutes. Scroll down for video . Sean Pollard lost both his arms when he was attacked by two great white sharks while surfing in WA in October .

That's when it come up out of the water, I didn't even see its teeth. It took me like across, and its eye was right there in front of me. 'Its eye was the blackest black I'd ever seen, and that's just a vision that's burnt into my mind. I can't get it out, just this cover going over its eye as it bit down on me.' 'It started shaking its head. Both my arms were in its mouth and it just took me underwater. I remember having to hold my breath and just shook its head, like seven or eight times …it's just the hardest thing I've ever felt. It was so strong. 'Its eye was the blackest black I'd ever seen, and that's just a vision that's like burnt into my mind. I can't get it out, just this cover going over its eye as it as it bit down on me,' he said .

"Former Chicago police commander Jon Burge has been released from a Florida halfway house after 4 ½ years in federal custody for lying about the torture of suspects. Darlene Tyler, the residential re-entry manager at the Orlando-area facility, says Burge was released Friday, a day early, because his scheduled release date fell on a weekend. More than 100 people have accused Burge and officers under his command of shocking, suffocating and beating them into giving false confessions in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the victims were given electric shocks as they were forced to confess, they claimed. Jon Burge (above) is pictured as he heads into his trial in 2011 in this file photo . Burge was convicted of perjury for lying to a jury in 2003 when he claimed he had no knowledge of violent methods being used to extract confessions. He was not put on trial for torture because the statute of limitations had expired. One victim, Madison Hobley, who was sentenced to death for a 1987 fire that killed seven people including his wife and son, claimed he had a plastic typewriter cover put over his head so he couldn’t breathe. Burge denied knowing anything about the ‘bagging’ or taking part in it. However, Mr Hobley was later pardoned. Ronald Kitchen, who was freed from prison after 21 years when it was proven that the senior officer had coerced him into falsely confessing to murder, said the officer deserved a long spell in jail. ‘He was our Al Qaeda, he was our bin Laden in our neighborhood,’ he said. The allegations against the 63-year-old and his men even helped shape the state's debate over the death penalty. Former Illinois Governor George Ryan released four condemned men from death row in 2003 after Ryan said Burge extracted confessions from them using torture. The allegations of torture and coerced confessions eventually led to a brief moratorium on Illinois' death penalty. The 67-year-old Burge served most of his sentence in federal prison in North Carolina. He spent his final months at the halfway house.","Former Chicago police commander Jon Burge has been released from a Florida halfway house after 4 ½ years in federal custody .

"A 12-year-old boy has become the youngest person in Britain to have a gastric band fitted, as doctors struggle to fight the child obesity epidemic. The schoolboy is one of an increasing number of youngsters who have had the controversial weight-loss operations, despite recommendations that such high-risk surgery should be a last resort when other efforts to slim down have failed. Figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show that 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach-shrinking surgery at NHS and private hospitals over a three-year period. They include the 12-year-old, one boy aged 13 and two boys aged 15. Scroll down for video . Indulgent: Natalie admits she gives daughter Talulah, aged four, sweets 'for an easy life' Leading doctors and dentists blame parents for letting their children become so unhealthy that they need surgery – not just gastric bands but also operations to remove rotten teeth caused by sugary diets. Professor Monty Duggal, head of paediatric dentistry at Leeds Dental Institute, who regularly operates on obese children to remove decayed teeth, said it was ‘a matter of national shame that we have these health problems when we are a wealthy, developed nation. The treatments I carry out all cost taxpayers money. ‘[Yet] as a professional in my field I have to approach parents with great caution. I can’t accuse parents of anything. But of course the parent is responsible for the child’s welfare and health.’ He added that social workers would be quick to step in at any sign of a parent abusing a child, ‘yet you can have a child with up to 20 decayed teeth in their mouth, a big fat face, seriously ill and having to be admitted to hospital for a serious operation under general anaesthetic without consequence for the parent.’ Denisa, 13, visits King’s College Hospital in London with her parents to be assessed for the £12,000 surgery . 'One last treat': Denisa and her family in McDonald's - minutes after she was assessed for surgery . His comments come as a new Channel 4 documentary series reveals some of the extreme cases doctors have to deal with at specialist NHS clinics that offer gastric bands to under 18s. The two-part series called Junk Food Kids: Who’s To Blame? features one 13-year-old schoolgirl who weighs 16st. Denisa, who came to Britain from Romania four years ago, visits King’s College Hospital in London with her parents to be assessed for the £12,000 surgery. During a consultation about the operation, Denisa’s mother, who is not named in the programme, is questioned about the efforts her daughter has made to lose weight. Speaking in broken English, she explains: ‘We keep on diet, all three together. It was very good, but now we cannot keep. She cannot give up bread – she likes very much.’ The family are given a detailed diet plan when they leave in a final attempt to try reduce Denisa’s weight without surgery. But just 15 minutes later, the family are shown heading straight to a nearby McDonald’s for ‘one last treat’. The documentary series also features children attending NHS obesity services in Leeds and being treated for associated conditions such as dental decay. One of these youngsters is four-year-old Talulah, who due to her weight struggles to fit into a uniform designed for nine-year-olds for her first day at school. In a shameful admission, her mother, referred to only by her first name Natalie, says despite her daughter’s obesity problems she continues to indulge her with sweets for an ‘easy life’. ‘I like to just have an easy life,’ the 29-year-old says. ‘I think everyone just wants an easy life. Sometimes I think to myself no I shouldn’t give in – but I do.’ In another heartbreaking scene, Talulah is seen in tears after surgery to remove eight of her teeth, which have badly decayed because of her sugary diet. But Natalie seems equally unapologetic about the situation. She said: ‘I know that’s my fault, but it was easier for me on a night to give her a bottle of juice than to try to sit up with her all night and get her back to sleep.’ In the same documentary, consultant Fiona Campbell, who works at Leeds Children’s Hospital said: ‘I think the parents have to be blamed for overweight children, but they have to be helped. Critic: Professor Monty Duggal blames parents . ‘Although this is difficult for them – and we can understand chastising children and stopping them doing what they want is difficult – I’m afraid that’s their responsibility. It comes with being a parent.’ Denisa’s family also continues to make a string of excuses about their daughter’s failure to reduce her dangerously high weight and why they are putting her forward for the surgery. Her father Virgil says: ‘Dieting, changing your eating style, is about the power of willing. ‘And we’ve demonstrated we’re not that strong. ‘She tried to lose weight when she was 11 and 12, but got fatter and fatter. But with surgery you don’t have to give up on temptations.’ Denisa herself admits: ‘My parents find it hard to keep to a diet. That’s why I can’t keep to a diet because they find it hard.’ Gastric band surgery is only offered to obese patients as a last resort, and children or teenagers must meet a strict criteria before they are even considered for the procedure. To qualify they must have a body mass index of more than 40, have reached puberty, have first tried to slim through dieting or exercise, and have a full understanding of the psychological implications. But even with these stringent rules, Government figures show the number of young people under 19 having gastric bands on the NHS doubled between 2007 and 2013, when more than 200 children had the surgery. The average cost of the operation is more than £7,000. Official statistics from the National Bariatric Surgery Register, which is compiled from surgeons’ reports, reveal that the 12-year-old boy is the youngest child to have been fitted with a gastric band within this group, although it is not recorded if the operation was publicly or privately funded. NHS statisticians said the youngest patient they had on record for bariatric surgery paid for by the Health Service was 13. However, many surgeons argue that the stomach bands could save the NHS money through reducing levels of obesity and associated illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, which are estimated to cost the Health Service £5 billion a year. Dr Lucy Stirling, a clinical psychologist at King’s College Hospital, said parents whose children are facing gastric band surgery can fail to take responsibility for their child’s weight issues. She said: ‘Parents can be in denial of the part they have played. ‘But children need to be brought up to eat in such a way that they’re nurturing their body rather than slowly damaging it.’ Paediatric consultant Ashish Desai added: ‘Some parents, when they come to us, have the idea that if their child has the surgery it will act like a magic wand.’ Junk Food Kids: Who’s To Blame will be broadcast on Channel 4 at 10pm on Wednesday.","Schoolboy is one of an increasing number of youngsters who have had op .

"The inquiry into historic child sex abuse is to be extended to crimes committed as long ago as the Second World War – and possibly even further. It means child sex perverts dating back 70 years will be pursued, and raises the prospect of people in their 90s being hauled before the inquiry. Those suspected of committing crimes will be handed over to police and could face jail. Tough stance: Justice Lowell Goddard says the inquiry into historic child sex abuse is to be extended to crimes committed as long ago as the Second World War – and possibly even further . The extension in the investigation, sparked by claims of a 1980s Westminster paedophile ring, was revealed by Justice Lowell Goddard, the new head of the inquiry, in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. New Zealander Goddard was recruited by Home Secretary Theresa May after two other women picked to lead it had to step down due to links with the Establishment. Until now, it was thought the inquiry would focus on the post-1970 era. But Justice Goddard is backing demands to go further. 'It's elastic,' she says. 'The terms of reference talk about going back to 1970 but there is a push from certain quarters to take it back to about 1945. A cut-off point is always a bit artificial – someone who falls on the wrong side of it is aggrieved.' The Mail on Sunday understands that Justice Goddard is backed by Mrs May, who is considering removing all time limits, meaning it could take in the entire 20th Century. Either way, it will be the world's biggest ever investigation into paedophiles – and will take years. But Justice Goddard plans to issue a series of interim reports to avoid a repeat of the scandal over the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War, which has been held up for six years. Axed: Baroness Butler-Sloss quit as chairman of the inquiry after questions were raised about her brother sitting in the Cabinet in the 1980s. Her replacement Fiona Woolf later resigned over her links to former home secretary Leon Brittan . In a wide-ranging interview, in which she also revealed details of a tragic marriage cut short by illness, Justice Goddard, 66, said she: . The alleged 1980s Westminster child sex ring is said to have involved senior figures. Former Tory Home Secretary Leon Brittan, who died last month, was accused of being involved and of covering it up, though this has never been substantiated. Justice Goddard said she 'wouldn't shrink' from summoning prominent people to give evidence. 'I don't feel intimidated,' she said. 'Nobody should be beyond the reach of the law.' She added it was 'far too early' to say if she would ask to speak to Lady Brittan, Lord Brittan's widow. 'The Westminster aspect is just one,' she said, confirming she will look at 'institutional allegations going back to post-Second World War'. Justice Goddard also said she believed child sex abusers of 1945 should be treated the same as those in 2015. 'Sexual abuse of little children has never been anything short of a serious crime and that does not alter through religious or cultural mores or a different era or time,' she said. 'If criminal offending is evident it will be handed to police. There are people who need to be given a voice about what has happened to them.'","Justice Lowell Goddard says sex perverts from 70 years ago to be pursued .

"A coworker of the cab driver allegedly responsible for the crash that killed CBS correspondent Bob Simon allegedly warned management two days before the accident about his driving. The New York Post reports a driver at the same cab company passed on passenger complaints about Abdul Reshad Fedahi, 44, to his bosses, but that didn't stop him from getting on the road. 'Management said they’ll check with the lawyers, and they said if he has a valid license, he can work,' one driver said. 'And then this happened.' Scroll down for videos . Veteran journalist Bob Simon, pictured in 2011 in his CBS office with his impressive collection of Emmys, was killed in a taxi crash in New York City on Wednesday . Investigators believe that Fedahi, of Queens, may have been speeding along the West Side Highway on Wednesday, leading up to the crash that killed the 73-year-old CBS reporter. A preliminary investigation showed Fedahi may have hit the gas instead of the brake before colliding with a Mercedes-Benz and then careening into the median. The driver had been fired from his company, Skyline Credit Ride, before but came back two months ago after new management took over the business. 'Since he came back, customers were e-mail­ing the company,' one cab driver told the Post. 'They didn't feel comfortable riding with him.' Fedahi, whose license had been suspended nine times, was leasing a car from Travez Transportation, which is invested in Skyline. The arrangement allowed him to drive under a 'full-hire vehicle' license rather than a cab driver medallion, the latter of which requires going to taxi school. Reshad Abdul Fedahi, from Queens, New York, also had two previous traffic convictions and his license suspended more than half a dozen times . Veteran correspondent Bob Simon was in a taxi that hit a Mercedes-Benz being driven by a 23-year-old man, and then slammed into the median on Manhattan's West Side on Wednesday night . 'He hit me and he looked like he lost control of the car,' said the 23-year-old driver of the Mercedes about the livery cab driver following the accident on the West Side Highway. The car that Simon was traveling in is pictured . He was also driving without the use of his left arm, which had gone 'dead' from injuries sustained in what the Post reports was a failed suicide attempt about a decade ago. CBS reports that Fedahi, an Afghan immigrant, had been living at a homeless shelter on Ward's Island towards the north of the city for at least four months before the crash. Simon, 73, who survived being held in an Iraqi prison under the regime of Saddam Hussein and was one of the last reporters to leave Saigon during the Vietnam War, died after the crash on Manhattan's West Side Highway. He was reportedly not wearing a seatbelt, and suffered a broken neck and stomach injuries in the crash according to the New York Post. Simon was on his way to hear a friend give a lecture about Ebola, which he was working on a segment about, downtown at the time. His family were believed to be finalizing the award-winning journalist's funeral plans today to be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home. It was suggested that Fedahi, may have suffered a heart attack shortly before the crash but the report was unconfirmed, according to the New York Daily News. He suffered two broken legs and a broken arm and was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was in a stable condition. Fedahi is estranged from his wife, Shekiba, with whom he has a daughter. His cousin, Rauf Sharif, claims that after the separation from his wife, Fedahi tried to take his own life. 'He was on a suicide mission,' said the man. 'He dropped himself from a building. I don't know how many floors in Brooklyn. He went through hard days in his life.' From the catastrophic damage to the livery cab at the scene, investigators were planning to interview the driver because they believe speed may have been a factor in the crash. The Emmy-award winning reporter had been travelling south in a Lincoln when it rear-ended a Mercedes-Benz stopped at a red light on 12th Avenue near West 30th Street around 6.45pm, and then slammed into the metal barriers separating the lanes. The driver of the Mercedes-Benz was identified as  Zachary Miller, 23, of New Rochelle, by the Daily News. Bob Simon is seen after he was released from 40 days of captivity by Iraqi forces during the first Iraq War on March 2, 1991 . Mr Miller told the New York Post on Thursday said: 'Obviously, I’m devastated to hear that he had died, and I wish there was something anyone could have done to prevent this horrible thing from happening.' The 23-year-old, who was not injured, said that he had the utmost sympathy for Simon's wife and daughter. Mr Miller has given a full statement to the police. Simon, who lived on the Upper West Side, had been traveling downtown to attend a medical seminar. The crash was not caught on surveillance camera but investigators were expected to look at the livery cab's 'black box'. The NYPD refused to comment on the crash to Daily Mail Online on Thursday, citing an ongoing investigation. No charges have so far been filed. Simon is survived by his wife, Françoise Simon, daughter, Tanya, who is a producer for 60 Minutes, son-in-law Dr Evan Garfein and his grandson, Jack.

"If it was up to Kanye West, we'd all be strutting around in flesh-coloured body stockings next season. As ridiculous as it may sound, that may well be the case as the musician-come-designer has received an abundance of praise for his range for Adidas from fashion editors, authorities, and influencers. The collection made its way down the runway on the first day of New York Fashion Week yesterday, comprising of full body stockings, see-through skin-coloured crop tops and visible nude pants. It's certainly a new take on underwear as outerwear - one certainly not for the faint hearted. Scroll down for video . Deni Kirkova, 24, from London, stepped out on a London High Street to find out what the reaction from onlookers would be . She wore a High Street makeshift version of the types of outfits seen on the Kanye West X Adidas catwalk, right . The Kanye West Adidas Fall 2015 collection received an abundance of praise from fashion elite - but do the public agree it's a hot look? To win praise for his fashion is certainly a step forward for Kanye - now Femail are testing whether his clothes will be as popular with the public. Writer Deni Kirkova, 24, from London, trialled the full flesh-coloured body stocking look, stepping out on a London High Street  to find out what the reaction from onlookers would be. She paired an American Apparel bralet (£12.50), crop top (£10), leggings (£14) and - of course - a £6 pair of pants, from Marks & Spencer, worn over the top, all in a beige flesh tone, topping off the look with a Kim K style parka jacket from Topshop. Speaking about her outfit, and whether she thought it worked, Deni said: 'The problem is visible pants. It's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now, and it's a bit of a laugh, but I wouldn't dare go out like this seriously. 'A nude crop top and leggings, though, could work. You'd have to tone this down a notch to take it from catwalk to High Street. 'I'm quite surprised that people on the street generally liked my outfit to be honest - some fashion know-it-alls praised how bold it was, noting the Kanye influence, and said that the jacket and lipstick went well with the all-nude look. 'Some though, of course, said that the pants were too much.' Deni paired an American Apparel bralet, crop top, leggings and  pair of M&S pants worn over the top, all in a beige flesh tone, with a parka . Deni's look was inspired by Adidas Originals x Kanye West Yeezy collection seen in New York on Thursday. The designer's wife Kim Kardashian, 34, turned up wearing an ensemble from the range. She liked the look so much, she even posted an Instagram photo of herself, adding: 'My look for the Yeezy show!!!!!! Yeezy head to toe!!!!!' Critics similarly seemed to enjoy Kanye's latest fashion offerings with Vogue saying: 'Kanye West's New collection with Adidas lives up to the hype.' He had the fashion bible's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, and top designer Alexander Wang sitting front row. Kanye's wife Kim Kardashian showed up to the event wearing a brown body stocking with a grey crop top and a camo jacket . Everyone from builders to couples and fashionistas to old ladies seemed to like the bold look, much to Deni's surprise . Everyone from builders to couples and fashionistas to old ladies seemed to like the bold look, much to Deni's surprise . The problem for Deni was visible pants. 'It's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now, but I wouldn't dare go out like this seriously' A review posted on the fashion magazine's website said: 'Hems were raw and frayed, tops billowy, bottoms either skintight to slide into newly unveiled suede stiletto boots or cinched and ready to be tucked into aforementioned Boosts. 'There were immaculate flak vests and officer sweaters that looked like they’ve actually taken shrapnel, and everything was said to be unisex... On display, in rigid lines of expressionless youth, it was at the very least satisfyingly instigative for a line of sportswear.' Refinery 29  noted that Kanye's collection probably would sell well saying: 'It was a lineup of oversized jackets, sweatshirts, sweaters, and leggings, interspersed with Vanessa Beecroft-esque nude-colored underwear. 'A camo parka that Kim Kardashian also wore was a highlight, and we thought the oversized backpack was a clever accessory that'll probably make it into a healthy stack of editorials.' Kanye claims that he wanted the collection to be made up of 'solutions based clothing,' saying, 'I don't want the clothes to be the life, I want the clothes to help the life.' It is also thought that it will have a relatively low price point compared to other designer clothes meaning the pieces can be snapped up by his fans. Now that the fully nude spray-on look has won approval from fashion darlings and the man on the street, will you be trying it out? Deni says maybe a nude crop top and leggings could work - without the pants. You'd have to tone this down a notch .

"In Wolf  Hall he plays the supreme man of reason, Thomas Cromwell. But today actor Mark Rylance reveals that he has a far more superstitious side offscreen. The star confesses that he turned to the roll of the dice and an ancient Chinese divination technique to make decisions over his career – and credits the advice it gave for his 22-year marriage. In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, Rylance says he ‘asked’ the 3,000-year-old ‘I Ching’ book for guidance in 1987 when he couldn’t choose between a career at the National Theatre and a part in Steven Spielberg’s film Empire Of The Sun. Mark Rylance, who plays Thomas Cromwell admitted that he is very superstitious while off screen . He said: ‘I turned to the I Ching and you just ask it “Where now?” ‘And it gives an answer. The answer it gave if I went to the theatre was community and that swayed it for me. I had never experienced community on film sets... And it was because of that decision I met my wife Claire.’ She was musical director at the theatre at the time. Believers in I Ching – or ‘Book of Changes’ – solve problems in their lives by putting the result of dice throws into a hexagram, which can be looked up in the ancient text for meaning. In the interview, which airs at 11.15am today, Rylance talks candidly about his belief in fate, saying: ‘I think there is evidence for consciousness that is not limited by our physical nature.’ Rylance, who could not speak properly until he was six, was the first artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre.

"A veteran truck driver from Texas claims he was fired for repeatedly putting down 'Jesus' as his co-pilot in his logbooks. Last month, Ramiro Olivarez, of Rio Grande Valley, received a letter of termination from his employer, the Falfurrias-based On Point Services, accusing him of submitting incomplete documentation and falsifying legal documents. But according to Olivarez, who is a devout Christian, his only crime was putting down the name 'Jesus' as his co-driver in his daily logbooks - something he has been doing throughout his career. Jesus, don't take the wheel: Veteran truck driver Ramiro Olivarez claims he was fired for repeatedly putting down 'Jesus' as his co-pilot in his logbooks . Nuclear option: Olivarez said had his employers asked him to stop using the name of the Son of God, he would have complied, but they chose to terminate him . The law requires truck drivers to sign their logbooks, but the name of a co-pilot can be written in, or left blank. Olivarez’s pink slip stated that the driver broke federal and state laws by using the name ‘Jesus.’ ‘Jesus is my co-driver, and I have no shame in that,’ he told the station KRGV. ‘That's my belief that he's with me.’ Olivarez said had his employers asked him to stop using the name of the Son of God, he would have complied, or possibly substituted it with a cross. The veteran trucker is convinced that he was let go because of his religious beliefs. The law requires truck drivers to sign their logbooks, but the name of a co-pilot can be written in or left blank .

"The Palestinian . government called the murder of three young Muslims in North Carolina 'terrorist' killings and asked to be included in the US investigation in a statement Saturday. Police charged Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, with shooting Deah Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor . Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister Razan Abu-Salha, 19, in Chapel Hill on Tuesday. Local authorities said they believe the killings followed a dispute over parking at the condominium complex where the four were neighbors, but Justice Department and FBI officials have launched an investigation into whether hate crime charges or other federal violations are warranted. Scroll down for video . 'Terrorism': The Palestinian government on Saturday asked to send authorities to assist in the investigation of the killings of three young Muslims in North Carolina. Shown are protesters in Gaza City on Thursday . Gunned down: (From left) Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all shot dead near the University of North Carolina on Tuesday . Calling Hicks 'an American extremist and hateful racist,' the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the shootings were indicative of rising anti-Muslim discrimination in the United States. 'We consider it a serious indication of the growth of racism . and religious extremism which is a direct threat to the lives of . hundreds of thousands of American citizens who follow the . Islamic faith,' said the ministry in a statement. The statement made a request for 'a serious investigation and the involvement . of Palestinian investigators to clarify the circumstances of . these assassinations and premeditated murders.' The father of the two women, Dr Mohammad Abu-Salha, called the killings a hate crime, echoing the demands of some Muslim groups for federal authorities to investigate. 'It was execution style, a bullet in every head,' Abu-Salha told the News Observer. 'This was not a dispute over a parking space, this was a hate crime. The New York Times revealed that Hicks often made posts on Facebook disparaging organized religions like Islam. Brother: Farris Barakat, the brother of Deah, one of those shot 'execution style,' remains kneeling after a prayer during a funeral service for the three slain Muslims in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday . Laid to rest: Mourners carried the body of Deah Barakat during a funeral service for the three slain Muslims in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday . Newlyweds: The couple are only thought to have been married for just a month and were fundraising for Syrian refugees . People posted pictures of the couple, newly married, on Twitter just hours after they were both murdered . In court: Craig Hicks, 46, is pictured as he enters the courtroom for his first appearance at the Durham County Detention Center on Wednesday - a day after he allegedly shot three young students to death . But much of his rage also seemed directed at Christians, whose intelligence Hicks criticized because of their belief in the Bible and many of whose opposition to the planned mosque near the former site of New York's Twin Towers Hicks deemed hypocritical in a 2010 post. The Guardian reports that police found a dozen firearms and huge amounts of ammunition as they executed a warrant to search his apartment after the shooting. President Obama issued a statement Friday deeming the killings 'brutal and outrageous' and said no one should be targeted for their religion. In the aftermath of the shooting, Hicks was described as menacing his young Muslim neighbors over trivial issues such as parking and noise complaints. 'This man had picked on my daughter and her husband a couple of times before, and he talked with them with his gun in his belt,' said Dr Abu-Salha. 'They were uncomfortable with him, but they did not know he would go this far.' Heartbreaking: Yusor shared this beautiful photo showing her dancing with her father at their wedding. On Wednesday, he said that he believes the trio were shot due to their religion and culture . Hicks, pictured in an image he shared to Facebook, identified himself as an atheist on social media . Anti-theist: Hicks posted attacks against Christians and Muslims on his Facebook wall . Armed: Two weeks ago he shared this image of his 'loaded 38 revolver, its holster and five extra rounds' A friend of Yusor Abu-Salha, Amira Ata, told Fusion that Hicks visited the apartment one night after Ata had left, to complain about the couple having guests over, all the while casually holding a rifle. Police say that Hicks is cooperating, and that their preliminary investigation showed that the parking dispute was the motive. There have also been questions over whether Hicks' anti-religious stance - which he freely shared on social media - had also been a factor in the murders. Hicks posted a photo from United Atheists of America on Facebook February 8, which has the title 'Why are radical Christians and radical Muslims so opposed to each others' influence when they agree about so many ideological issues?' On the page he is listed as married and having studied to become a paralegal at Durham Technical Community College. Records show his wife works at UNC Hospital. Police were called to Summerwalk Circle after shots were heard at about 5.10pm on Tuesday. When they arrived they found three people dead. They had been shot in the head, CNN reported. According to their Facebook pages, Mr Barakat had married his wife just over a month ago and was a second year student at the dental school at the University of North Carolina. The last picture on his Facebook page, posted on January 29, said he helped provide free dental supplies to 75 homeless people in downtown Durham. The couple had organized an online fundraiser to get dental care to refugees from Syria, raising around $15,000 - but after news of their deaths, the total reached more than $23,000 . Mr Barakat was due to travel to Turkey in the summer to treat children who have become refugees following the civil war. Last month, he tweeted: 'It's so freaking sad to hear people saying we should 'kill Jews' or 'Kill Palestinians'. As if that's going to solve anything SMH [shaking my head].' His sister-in-law Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha had been studying for a degree at North Carolina State University in Architecture and Environmental Design. After their deaths, Barakat's brother Farris paid tribute to the trio on Facebook as he struggled to comprehend the killings. 'It doesn't make sense,' he wrote, 'and for that I rely on the Most Wise. It hurts and for that I know that God will not burden me more than I can handle.' 'I know my brother, his wife, and his sister in law are together as ultimate winners. This life was only ever a test and they have passed with flying colors...' 'I haven't even begun to fully comprehend what has happened. But I know for sure those three together have done so much we are all proud of. No reason to stop being proud now.' He added: 'We live as Muslims to die as Muslims. May Allah enter them to the highest of paradise.'","Craig Hicks, 46, has been charged with the murders of three Muslim students near the UNC campus in Chapel Hill on Tuesday .

"The winery which produced the sleep-inducing bottle of wine that made Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fall asleep during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address is cashing in on its new fame. Ginsburg, who said she wasn't '100 per cent sober' when she nodded off during President Obama's speech last month, blamed her nap on a bottle of 'very fine California' wine that her colleague Anthony Kennedy brought to dinner. The judge, 81, told attendees of a Smithsonian Associates event in Washington, D.C. the wine Kennedy brought to dinner was 'an Opus something or other'. Scroll down for video .

"This is the shocking moment two Irish travellers were caught on CCTV brutally assaulting a man during a night out because they wrongly thought he was insulting their heritage. Gerald and Michael Connors, 20 and 18 respectively, were out drinking in Bristol in the afternoon when they claim to have been verbally abused by someone disrespecting their culture. Hours later the brothers attacked a group of men they saw standing outside a bar in what police believe to be a case of mistaken identity. They targeted Daniel Athey who was standing with his back to a shop wall, pummeling him with their fists until he doubled over. This is the moment Irish traveller brothers Gerald and Michael Connors were caught on CCTV violently attacking 'defenceless' Daniel Athey after mistaking the man for someone who verbally abused them over their heritage hours earlier . The attack was caught on CCTV cameras in the area and shown at Bristol Crown Court where the brothers were found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They were sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for 18 months, after leaving the victim with a cut on his head. Prosecutor Kenneth Bell described the moment Mr Athey was approached as he stood with friends in the street. Esther Garland, who was there at the time, told of how the Connors brothers asked them for balloons before launching the attack. 'She said the group didn’t know what they were talking about and why they were becoming so aggressive,' said Mr Bell. 'Their reaction was to become louder and begin squaring up to the group, in particular a man among them called Daniel Athey.' He described the assault as 'fast and furious', with the brothers quickly walking away to try to hail a taxi. 'They punched a man who was defenceless - he had his back against the wall,' said Mr Bell. A woman stands in front of the group to ward off attack from the brothers who had been drinking for hours . The pair pummeled Mr Athey with their fists until he doubled over in the attack described as 'fast and furious' 'The Crown would say this was a serious assault. 'There is an element of pre-meditation because these two obviously wanted to punch this man - they could have easily walked away.' Neither of the men had previous convictions for violence and told the court they were 'ashamed' of their actions but had been spurred on by racially aggressive comments. Catherine Spedding, defending, said: 'They acted out of character - it was a mistake they bitterly regret.' Judge William Hart, who told each man to complete 200 hours of community service, said:  'I hope you feel ashamed of yourselves. 'It’s very clear from the footage that you are both very handy with your fists and could have injured Mr Athey much more seriously. 'You inflicted a quick - but very violent - assault on this man.' 'The only thing that has saved you from custody is your youth and the fact you have no previous convictions for violence - you are very very close to having to go to jail.' The men were found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court where footage of the incident was shown .

"Caylyn Otto bought a bracelet for her unborn son, but not for his baptism. 'I pictured it being on an urn or being buried with him,' Otto said. 'I never thought he'd get to wear it.' But now instead of planning his funeral, the Mesa, Arizona dental assistant can start planning her son's future. Transplant: Caylyn Otto places her hands on her son, Oliver, at the Phoenix Children's Hospital in Phoenix on Friday where the baby is one of the youngest heart transplant recipients . New arrival:. Born nearly seven weeks early, the baby has been doing remarkably well post heart transplant . Born nearly seven weeks early, Oliver became one of the youngest heart transplant recipients at Phoenix Children's Hospital last month. He will need to be hospitalized a few more weeks. But doctors say Oliver, who was due Feb. 20, has been doing remarkably well post-transplant. 'He immediately looked like a new baby,' said father Chris Crawford, a pizza delivery driver. Otto said doctors noticed about 20 weeks into her pregnancy that Oliver's heart was significantly enlarged. At an appointment a month later, the heart had only gotten bigger. The couple, who have a 20-month-old son, was then told to be prepared for their baby possibly being still-born or to consult with hospice caregivers. Little survivor: He will need to be hospitalized a few more weeks. But doctors say Oliver, who was due Febuary 20, has been doing remarkably well post-transplant . Oliver was born Jan 5 with a heart the size of a 5-year-old child's with a large left ventricle, Otto said. Dr. John Nigro, the pediatric cardio surgeon who performed the transplant, said the heart was affecting the infant's lung and kidney development. Ideally, an infant needs to reach a gestational age of 36 weeks before undergoing a heart transplant, according to Nigro. But Oliver was put on the transplant list. To everyone's surprise, a donor heart became available a few days later. Though Oliver was not yet at the ideal age, the surgical team decided to have him go through the 10-hour procedure. 'If you get the perfect donor, you may never get that donor again,' said Dr. Daniel Velez, who was in charge of procuring the heart and making sure it met all the requirements needed for Oliver. Feeling blessed:;p The couple, who have a 20-month-old son, was then told to be prepared for their baby possibly being still-born or to consult with hospice caregivers . Lucky mother: Caylyn Otto looks over at her son Oliver one of the youngest heart transplant receivers . Velez said the hospital conducts about one heart transplant a month. But the last time the procedure was performed on someone as young as Oliver was about a year ago. Nigro said everyone has been pleasantly surprised at how Oliver, who now weighs 7 pounds, is coping. 'He's a real fighter. There's no question about that,' Nigro said. Oliver will have to be on immunosuppressant drugs and be constantly monitored for the rest of his life. But there's no reason not to expect that he can't go on to live a normal life like going to school and playing sports, Crawford said. He said now they can joke that the size of their son's heart was an indicator of who he is as a person. 'That's been the joke: He had too much love. He had to give it away,' Crawford said.

Other ideas included Romsey and Juliet, Darling Dorking, Gorgeous Guildford, Hampton Courting and Strawberries and Champagne Hill. Some of the carriages also had their destinations on-board changed to say 'love train' too. The romantic gesture has had a huge reaction on social media, with many commuters taking to Twitter to share their pictures of the signs.

Melissa Loader said: 'Put big smiles on our faces today!! Thank you South West Trains!' while Alex Dowding said the operator was 'on fire with the Valentine's Day puns'. Another user wrote: 'Thank you for making people smile with your Valentine station names. It’s things like this that set you apart from other train lines.' While Hayley Johnson joked: 'I think @SW_Trains missed a trick this Valentine's by not including ""Feltham-up"".' A spokeswoman for the South West Trains-Network Rail Alliance said: 'In the spirit of Valentine's Day we asked our customers and employees to suggest quirky romance-themed alternatives to our station names. Signs were changed to When Harry met Salisbury sign (left) and Liphook in Hampshire was changed to 'lips-hooked'. Basingstoke 'and Four weddings' and Portsmouth 'and Passionfield' was also changed (right) 'We got some great suggestions, many of which we are displaying on customer information screens across the network for today only. 'We hope those travelling with us today enjoy their journeys and have a lovely Valentine's Day.' But not all passengers were impressed by the romantic with send-off, with some describing it as 'a bit much' and others raising questions over the practicalities for tourists. Dam Tay said: 'Ok, having a laugh with station names today, but what about the confusion thats created for ppl whom English is not 1st language? [sic]'. Wonderful Woking, Beautiful Basingstoke and Hampton Courting were among other ideas to the company . But South West Trains confirmed they are 'actively monitoring this and staff are on hand to help should the need arise'. The train firm has also invited rugby fans on their way to and from the Six Nations rugby match between England and Italy at Twickenham today to have their Valentine's messages put on a board outside the station. It's asked lovers to tweet their message to them using the hashtag #SWValentine before 8pm .

"The University of St Andrews has been forced to apologise to hundreds of prospective students after wrongly telling them that their applications had been successful. The 'congratulations' email was intended for a small group of new students who had already been offered a place, inviting them to an open day at the renowned Scottish university. But it was accidentally sent to 760 applicants who were anxiously waiting for news - making them think they had been accepted when a decision had yet to be made. Mistake: The 'congratulations' email was intended for a small group of new students who had already been offered a place at the University of St Andrews, pictured, but was accidentally sent to 760 . The university, where Prince William and Kate Middleton met as students, sent a second email apologising for the mix-up 30 minutes later. It blamed the error on 'human error compounded by technology' and said it was sorry for any disappointment caused. Disappointed applicants took to Twitter to vent their frustration, with one user tweeting that the mistake was 'brutal'. According to the Times, the initial email read: 'Congratulations on your offer of a place to study here at the University of St Andrews! 'You may have already chosen St Andrews as your firm choice, but for those who have not, I know that there are many things for you to consider before making the choice of where you wish to study. 'To help you to make that decision, or just to give you a bit more information about student life here at St Andrews, I would like to offer you the opportunity to attend an information day here in St Andrews.' Frustration: Disappointed applicants took to Twitter after they were wrongly sent the email on Thursday . A statement released by the university said: 'We're very sorry that we wrongly sent an email to some of our Scottish applicants which may have given the impression that we had made a decision on their applications. 'The email should have gone only to a very small group of people already in receipt of offers from us to invite them to attend visiting days in St Andrews. 'In total, 760 of 3456 applicants received this email in error. 'The email was sent by alphabetical order and we believe that only applicants with first names from A to D were affected.' Former students: The university, where Prince William and Kate Middleton met as students (pictured), sent a second email apologising for the mix-up 30 minutes later - blaming 'human error compounded by technology' The statement added: 'We moved as quickly as possible to contact all our Scottish applicants to explain our mistake and apologise. 'A follow-up email was sent to all within half an hour of the initial mistake and our staff were on hand throughout yesterday afternoon and evening to respond to phone calls and questions from applicants.' The problem was 'human error compounded by technology', the university statement said. 'The team involved is devastated and the university is extremely sorry for the confusion and disappointment it has caused some applicants.'","Email was intended for applicants who had already been offered a place .

"Casually sipping a juice drink – with his high-visibility vest beside him on a table – a police officer chats to a colleague in the cafe of a health food store. It is in a burglary hot spot and a short distance from the scene of the 2011 Tottenham riots. But they are not two constables taking a break after pounding the beat. They are sitting in what passes for a police station in the constituency of Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone. Last week the delighted Liberal Democrat MP announced the opening of the police 'contact point' in her local branch of Planet Organic as 'great news'. Planet Organic Store in Muswell Hill, north London, is now a police contact point where the public can meet officers and report crimes . It is intended to replace the police station in Muswell Hill, which closed in 2013 after more than a century of service to the community. The new facility is supposed to offer all the services that would normally be provided by a police station, including receiving crime reports, giving advice to victims, processing witness statements and handling driving licences and insurance documents provided by motorists after accidents. But when The Mail on Sunday reporters observed the 'contact point' over two evenings last week, the police officers had no desk, no private area where they could speak to members of the public in confidence, no means of logging on to the police national computer, and they appeared not to have official forms. In the entire time the officers were there, not one offence was reported to them. Their only 'customer' during the first two-hour session was a passer-by who recognised one of the PCs from a dog-attack inquiry a year ago and popped in for a chat. A PC on duty at a Costa coffee shop in Leytonstone, east London, with a few leaflets to give to anyone who approached him . As she left the store, the woman remarked to her husband: 'If they spent two hours walking the streets it might be more useful.' This is the reality of policing in 2015 as forces struggle to cope with a 20 per cent budget cut imposed by Home Secretary Theresa May. Hundreds of police stations have closed, with the public offered a part-time service – dismissed by critics as a 'cops in shops' gimmick. The officers deployed at the Muswell Hill branch of Planet Organic relieved their boredom by perusing the shelves of antioxidant vegetable juice, vegan tofu and sea salt bathing crystals, or trying out the store's 'reverse osmosis de-ionising' water filter. One told an undercover reporter: 'If we weren't here, we would either be on the beat or visiting people at home, following up crime incidents that have been reported.' The contact point is open on Wednesdays and Thursdays between 6pm and 8pm, and on Saturdays between 1pm and 3pm. Campaigners say it should be a matter of shame for Ministers that the local police station, which closed two years ago and is being sold to developers, has been replaced by two PCs occupying borrowed space in the high street for just six hours a week. To give Ms Featherstone credit, she campaigned vigorously against the closure. But in her message to constituents last week, she welcomed the latest development as a victory. 'Residents will once again have a local contact point where they can meet local police and trained volunteers, and among other things will be able to report crimes, get crime prevention advice and hand in or collect lost property,' she wrote. Hundreds of police stations have closed, with the public offered a part-time service – dismissed by critics as a 'cops in shops' gimmick . However, an investigation by The Mail on Sunday has exposed her claims about the service now offered as wildly unrealistic. Undercover reporters who watched the police deployment at Planet Organic on Wednesday and Thursday found the scheme to be badly organised and virtually useless in terms of combating crime. There was no Metropolitan Police logo on display outside the store, and the only indication that the premises had been designated a 'contact point' was a small notice posted above head height just inside the entrance. No senior police officers were present and the shop seemed unprepared for the constables' arrival, leaving them in the embarrassing position of having to ask the store manager where they should sit. John Hajdu, chairman of the 700-member Muswell Hill and Fortis Green Association, said: 'It looked like they were two policemen on their break. There has been virtually no publicity. A proper service should have been put in place, not this sort of half-hearted measure.' On Thursday evening – the second day of the initiative – the officers brought crime prevention leaflets which they laid out on a table. None was taken. Store manager Amit Fridman said: 'I'm quite happy to have them here – it deters shoplifters.' Crime in the area has increased and the nearest 24-hour police station is four miles away. There is one closer, but it shuts on Sundays and Mondays, and after 6pm. Official figures for Haringey borough, which includes Muswell Hill, show violent crime in 2014 rose from 4,514 offences in the previous 12 months to 6,296; rape cases from 135 to 180; robbery from 926 to 1,019; and domestic burglary from 1,979 to 2,180. The run-down building that was Muswell Police Station for 100 years. It was shut down in 2013 . Officers deployed at the Muswell Hill branch of Planet Organic relieved their boredom by perusing the shelves of antioxidant vegetable juice, vegan tofu and sea salt bathing crystals . The Mail on Sunday visited a similar initiative in East London last week. There a uniformed police officer sat for an hour in a Costa Coffee outlet at a Tesco supermarket in Leytonstone without speaking to anyone for the entire time. He had to leave an hour before his shift was due to end when the cafe closed for the night. The three-times-a-week service has been operating since the local police station closed last October. West Yorkshire Police advertises a 'cuppa with a copper' at a cafe in Leeds. But critics say it is wrong to expect a woman who, for example, has been sexually assaulted to tell a police officer or volunteer about her ordeal in a coffee shop, where others may overhear, and there are no support services on site. A police review of the 'contact point' scheme last year found that makeshift police desks in supermarkets, libraries and community centres were being used by an average of just one person a week and failed to offer good value for money. Figures from the watchdog, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, show that in 2009-10, there were 1,218 police counters across England and Wales where people could report crime. By the end of next month, 264 are due to be shut down. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We remain committed to the delivery of contact points as part of our Wider Access strategy.' A spokesman for Ms Featherstone said: 'We will continue to work with police to ensure the service is helpful and effective for residents.' The closure of disused local ‘nicks’ may be bad for victims of crime but has been welcomed by imaginative developers. In Cumbria, Egremont police station is being turned into a hostel for the homeless – and given more than £100,000 by the Police and Crime Commissioner, who is at the same time cutting back on officers. The Boutique Spa in Kent has two branches, at Orpington and Beckenham, based in former police stations. Owner Rachael Polyviou said: ‘They are just really attractive old buildings.’ Demolition work recently began on a large police HQ in Leeds that is to become a branch of supermarket Aldi. And in the Bristol suburb of Redlands a Victorian police station is now an infants school. Architects kept white-tiled cells in the basement and turned them into a library. Overall, one in five police stations has been closed to the public since the last Election.","Hundreds of police stations have closed in wake of 20% budget cuts .
