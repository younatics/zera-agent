"(CNN) -- The shipping containers filled with illegal weapons seized in Lagos, Nigeria, earlier this week came from Iran, a leading global shipping company said Saturday. The company, CMA CGM, said it was a victim of false cargo declaration. The shipper -- who the company identified as an Iranian trader -- had listed the materials inside the containers as ""packages of glass wool and pallets of stone."" The containers in question were loaded in Bandar Abbas, a port in southern Iran, and discharged in Lagos in July, the company said. They were then transferred to a depot. Last week, the shipper asked that the containers be re-loaded and sent to Gambia, CMA CGM said in a statement, adding that the trader had obtained the necessary documentation and clearance for customs. Authorities in Nigeria intervened before the containers were moved. Nigeria's security service said earlier this week that it had seized 13 shipping containers in the Lagos port filled with illegal weapons, including rockets, grenades and bullets. Each shipping container carries 20 wooden crates. The seizure comes as Nigeria prepares for the 2011 elections, which analysts say are likely to be one of the most-controversial and potentially most-violent elections in the country's history.","CMA CGM says the containers came from a port in southern Iran .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Comedian Conan O'Brien returns to the late-night television circuit Monday with a much-anticipated new show. Actors Seth Rogen and Lea Michele will be guests on the first episode of ""Conan,"" which airs Monday at 11 p.m. ET on TBS. But the veteran host is keeping mum about a mystery guest -- the winner of an online poll. A guest lineup schedule posted on the new show's website says: ""You clicked and we listened! Who will be the poll winner: The Pope? The Sultan Of Brunei? Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Gerhard Ertl? WATCH AND FIND OUT!"" There's one person who probably won't be taking the stage in O'Brien's Burbank, California, studio any time soon: Jay Leno. ""He can come as the musical guest, because that I want to see... No, there are certain things I will not do, regardless of the price,"" O'Brien said in an interview in the December issue of Playboy. Will Conan O'Brien live up to the 'Conan' hype? O'Brien has been off the air since January, when NBC canceled Leno's primetime hour after disappointing ratings led to an affiliate revolt. NBC paid O'Brien and his staff an estimated $40 million to clear the way for Leno to return to the ""Tonight Show"" host chair he handed off to O'Brien last year. The settlement left O'Brien free to launch a competing show after September 1, 2010. TBS announced plans to bring O'Brien onboard in April. The cable network is owned by Turner Broadcasting, the same company that owns CNN. The ouster of O'Brien after just seven months on the show stirred his friends and fans -- dubbed Team CoCo -- to launch a variety of anti-NBC protests. Actors Tom Hanks, Jon Hamm and Michael Cera are among the guests slated to appear during the first week of O'Brien's new show. Musical guests Jack White, Soundgarden and Fistful of Mercy are also scheduled to perform. From 1993 to 2009, O'Brien hosted ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" on NBC. He is also a former editor of the Harvard Lampoon and writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Simpsons.""","O'Brien is returning after more than 9 months off the air .

"(CNN) -- Chris Hoy won a record equaling fifth Olympic gold medal as he anchored Britain's team sprint trio to a new world record in the velodrome Thursday. Hoy's gold saw him draw level with rower Steve Redgrave in the all-time British list and capped a superb day for the hosts. But there was disappointment for the partisan home crowd in the women's team sprint as the British pair of Victoria Pendleton and Jess Varnish were disqualified for a handover infringement after qualifying for the gold medal match against China. Jeers rang around the 6,000 seater velodrome when the decision was relayed, promoting German pair Miriam Welte and Kristina Vogel to the final. Pendleton, looking to cap her career with gold, tried her best to put on a brave face. ""It's one of those things that happens. It's quicker than a blink of an eye,"" she told BBC Sport. ""You have to stick by the rules. The rules are there to make it a fair sport."" Chinese pair Gong Jinjie and Guo Shuang had broken the world record twice in the first two rounds and crossed the line first against the Germans in a time of 32.619 seconds. Inside the London Olympics Velodrome . But they too then fell foul of the strict officials for their handover and were demoted to silver. Australia's Anna Meares and Kaarle McCulloch (32.727) claimed bronze ahead of Ukraine. Hoy and his teammates Philip Hindes and Jason Kenny had fallen foul of the handover rule at the world championships earlier this year, but made no mistake this time in the final against France. A superb lead off leg by 19-year-old German born Hindes set up Kenny then Hoy to bring them home in 42.600 seconds, beating the earlier world record of 42.747 they had set earlier in qualifying. Germany beat Australia for the bronze. Hoy has won a total of sixth Olympic medals, one shy of fellow cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who set a British record by winning Wednesday's men's time trial. Scot Hoy can draw level with Wiggins if he medals in the men's keirin event later in the program. ""It is quite overwhelming,"" he told BBC Sport. ""That last ride I dug deeper than I have ever dug before. I didn't want to let the boys down, they have been riding so well today. ""You can't overstate what it means to us in front of our home crowd."" GB, who dominated the track cycling in the 2008 Beijing Games, look set for more gold in the men's team pursuit after the quartet of Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh broke their own world record in qualifying. They clocked three minutes 52.499 seconds while closest rival Australia with Jack Bobridge, Glenn O'Shea, Rohan Dennis and Michael Hepburn were over three seconds adrift in going through second fastest.","GB team sprint squad win gold in world record time at Olympic Velodrome .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The International Weightlifting Federation has modified its rules and will allow athletes to wear a full-body, tight-fitted unitard during competition, the group said. Wednesday's rule change was prompted by an Atlanta woman, who wanted to take part in competitions governed by IWF rules but still adhere to the modest dress of her Muslim faith. ""Weightlifting is an Olympic Sport open for all athletes to participate without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin in accordance with the principles of the Olympic Charter and values,"" Tamas Ajan, IWF president, said Wednesday.  ""This rule modification has been considered in the spirit of fairness, equality and inclusion."" Before the change, the IWF's technical and competition rules said weightlifting outfits -- officially called ""costumes"" -- had to be collarless and not cover the elbows or knees. Abdullah, a 35-year-old with a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering, is not an Olympic athlete, but enjoys lifting weights. She generally wears loose, long pants past the ankles, a long-sleeve, fitted shirt with a loose T-shirt over it, and a hijab, or head scarf, covering her hair. ""It's what I believe in. It's what I've chosen to do,"" Abdullah told CNN this month about her decision to wear modest garb. ""I've always dressed this way publicly."" She can deadlift 245 pounds (111 kg) and get up 105 pounds (47.5 kg) in the snatch, in which the competitor lifts the barbell from the floor to over her head in a single motion. She likes to compete with other women in her weight class -- she generally weighs in the 106-pound (48 kg) or 117-pound (53 kg) classifications. ""It guess it's empowering,"" she says. ""There's a lot of technique involved, so someone who's this big muscular person -- it's possible I could lift more than they do. There's speed and timing to it -- you have to be explosive. I think it's great just for confidence building ... I guess I got hooked."" The review was prompted by the Atlanta resident wanting to take part in tournaments in the United States, including one coming up in July. But USA Weightlifting informed her that those events are governed by IWF rules, which at that time precluded her dressing in keeping with her beliefs. Abdullah says she understands the need to make sure she isn't wearing anything under her clothes to give her a competitive advantage. She says judges could check to make sure she is not wearing something on her elbows, for example, that might help her. Numerous athletic agencies have faced similar questions in the past and, in some cases, have determined that allowing special clothing violates fairness or equality among all contestants. FIFA, the international federation governing soccer, recently refused to allow Iran's women's soccer team to wear headscarves while playing in an Olympic qualifying round in Amman, Jordan. Abdullah told CNN her effort is not just about herself. ""I should at least try,"" she said, ""if not for me then maybe for other women who -- if they have my faith or another faith -- dress a certain way.""

"(CNN) -- China rekindled memories of the 2008 Olympics with a spectacular opening ceremony for the 16th Asian Games in Guangzhou on Friday. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao formally began the event, which will be the largest in its 59-year history with 28 Olympic and 14 non-Olympic sports and 476 gold medals to be won. China, which won a leading 166 golds at the previous competition in Qatar four years ago, has a delegation of 1,454 members including Olympic champion hurdler 110-meter hurdler Liu Xiang and badminton star Lin Dan. He Chong, who won diving gold in Beijing, capped a massive fireworks display in the middle of the Pearl River on Haixinsha Island by ignited a giant flare to light the cauldron that houses the Asiad flame. Afghanistan's athletes were the first of the 45 nations taking part to parade, with China concluding the march with Olympic women's rowing champion Jin Ziwei as flag bearer. ""Remember, you are part of history right here, right now,"" Olympic Council of Asia president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, of Kuwait, said in front of 30,000 people attending the ceremony. ""Please show us your best performance, and show us the spirit of sportsmanship, fair play, friendship and respect to your fellow athletes and officials."" The event's official website reported that Guangdong Province built and updated 70 stadiums for the competition, which runs until November 27, and that 900,000 volunteers will be on hand. It said since winning hosting rights in 2004, Guangzhou officials have given out one million brochures and sent 40 million text messages to teach its citizens better manners, including instructions on how to smile. This year, cricket, dance sports, dragon-boat racing, roller sports and Go chess will make their debut appearances in the competition.","Chinese city of Guangzhou succeeds Doha as host of the 16th Asian Games .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least five people were killed and 39 wounded when a car bomb exploded Monday in Basra, an Interior Ministry official said, capping a day in which at least 11 people were killed in blasts in cities with Shiite shrines. In Baghdad, two mortars or rockets struck the International Zone shortly before 8 p.m., though there were no reports of casualties. Car bombings targeting religious pilgrims in two major Shiite cities in Iraq killed 11 people Monday, an Interior Ministry official said. On a crowded street in the Iraqi city of Karbala a blast killed at least 10 people and wounded 38 others, the official said. The bomb went off at one of the main entrances to the city where buses carrying Iranian pilgrims stop, the official said. In Najaf, at least one person was killed and 10 others wounded in a bombing, the official said. The parked car bomb targeted buses carrying Iranian pilgrims at the road leading to Najaf's old city. Najaf and Karbala, south of Baghdad, have seen increases in foreign pilgrims in the last two years after a drop in the daily widespread violence. Iran's Fars News Agency said that on any given day, about 1,500 pilgrims travel from neighboring Iran to visit Shiite shrines in Iraq, particularly in Najaf and Karbala. Elsewhere Monday, a  roadside bomb detonated outside a busy restaurant in central Baghdad's Karrada district, wounding four people. The official said the bomb targeted a police patrol. Two of the wounded were police officers; the other two were civilians. Earlier Monday, a mortar round struck the International Zone, popularly known as the Green Zone, but did not cause damages or casualties. A day earlier, at least two rockets struck the area and on Saturday, three others struck the zone. The zone is a heavily fortified central Baghdad district housing the U.S. Embassy and Iraqi government offices.","NEW: Car bomb kills 5 in Basra .

"(Mashable) -- Can't wait until Friday to check out the latest installment of the ""Harry Potter"" film series? Well, if you have any knowledge of torrent sites at all, you should be able to view the first 36 minutes today, as a goodly chunk of the film has leaked online. The leak comes one day after the New York City premiere of the film. According to TorrentFreak, the beginning of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" (the first installment of the two-part finale) is currently available on dozens of torrent sites. A quick search by the staff of Mashable proved this to be true. Statement from Warner Bros. Entertainment on leak . This news is sure to cause a frenzy among Potter fans -- TorrentFreak reports that ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" scored a spot on its ""most pirated movies"" list with nearly 8 million downloads last year. The book version of ""Deathly Hallows"" also leaked -- back in 2007. So why is the cinematic leak only 36 minutes long? TorrentFreak postulates that Warner Bros. Pictures feared a leak, so it limited the time of the screeners to ensure that the whole film didn't make it to the web. Seeing as how the clip has hit the internet mere days before the premiere, we doubt it will have a negative effect on box office sales come Friday -- unless, of course, those first 36 minutes are irrevocably horrible. The last time we saw a leak of this magnitude was probably that of ""Wolverine,"" which leaked a month early last year yet was still a box office success.

"Editor's note: Lois Pope and Arthur H. Wilson are co-founders of the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation, the nonprofit organization that has spearheaded the development of The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. Award-winning actor Gary Sinise, star of ""CSI: NY,"" is the national spokesman for the memorial. As we prepare to pay tribute this Veterans Day to the courageous men and women who have selflessly served our country, the image of American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is in our minds. But we also must recognize that many thousands have returned from these wars with severe injuries and permanent disabilities. The numbers of troops coming home with damaged bodies and, in many cases, minds, is increasing. Advances in medical and military technology are reducing the number of deaths from combat, but soldiers who survive attacks often end up with lost limbs, horrific burns, traumatic brain injuries and other life-altering wounds. For example, in 2006 for every fatality in Iraq, there were 16 wounded. We need to do a better job of honoring and meeting our obligations to these unsung American heroes. Welcome home: Share your homecoming experience . Beyond significantly increasing funding to meet the ever-growing costs of treatment, as well as other benefits, America has a responsibility to ensure that our disabled veterans are never neglected or erased from our collective memory. A permanent public tribute to recognize them is now underway. Yesterday, in a ceremony attended by hundreds of disabled and able-bodied veterans whose service dates back to WWII. House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki and others joined us to break ground on The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. Sitting across from the U.S. Botanic Garden, in full view of the U.S. Capitol, this memorial will serve to educate generations about the true cost of war, and to celebrate the men and women who may be broken in body but never in spirit. The groundbreaking, however, marks just the beginning of efforts -- our obligation -- to create this memorial. Unfortunately, we often marginalize and forget the men and women who sacrificed for our freedom. In fact, Veterans Day itself has become for far too many of us an extra vacation day from work or school. For retailers, it has become yet another day to lure shoppers with special sales and promotions. All of us should instead consider this sobering fact:  Since 2001, the number of disabled veterans has risen by 25 percent to over 3 million today. In contrast, the increase in the six years prior to September 11, 2001, was just 4 percent. Well over 180,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are already collecting disability benefits. A Stanford University study last year estimated that as many as 35 percent of Iraq war veterans will suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome, a condition that has already led to high rates of depression, suicide, substance abuse, unemployment, relationship and family problems, and other issues. We have been privileged to meet a number of these veterans and have witnessed their Herculean struggles to regain health, reshape lives shattered by disability, learn new trades or professions, and rejoin the civilian world. While their disabilities remind us of the fragility of life, they also inspire us with their fortitude, strength of character, and unflagging commitment, not just to survive, but to flourish as devoted husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, friends and colleagues, and hard-working and productive citizens. We wish that every American could walk down the National Mall in Washington. It is a humbling and inspiring experience. The story of our country is told there in museums, monuments and memorials that commemorate the individuals and events that have shaped our history, molded our national character, and woven the very fabric of our nation. But, while there are many fitting memorials to fallen soldiers, as well as monuments to our founding fathers, there is nothing for disabled veterans. They are the only historically significant group that has not been recognized in such a manner. That is why the Memorial is so important. Much work still needs to be done, from fundraising and building an endowment to actual construction. We have faith that the American people -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- will continue to lend their support. It is not possible to look into the eyes of any disabled veteran and not feel compelled to do something to recognize what he or she has given up for our sake, for the freedoms that we take them for granted. John Quincy Adams said: ""You will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of it."" This Veterans Day, let us think on the words of America's sixth president. Let us pay special honor and be inspired by the over 3 million who continue to bear the scars of war long after the guns have fallen silent and the memory of their sacrifice has faded from the public's consciousness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gary Sinise, Lois Pope and Arthur Wilson.","Gary Sinise, Lois Pope and Arthur Wilson say many return from war disabled .

"(CNN) -- China ended the Asian Games in glorious style on Saturday, taking the final gold medal at stake in the women's volleyball competition in Guangzhou. The hosts came from two sets down to beat South Korea 3-2 in a thrilling final and take their seventh volleyball title. Earlier in the day Zhou Chunxiu added another gold to the hosts record-breaking medal haul when she successfully defended her women's marathon title, finishing in a time of two hours 25 minutes. Her compatriot Zhu Xiaolin took the silver medal, while North Korea's Kim Kum-Ok secured bronze. In the men's race, South Korea's Ji Youngjun took gold in a time of two hours 11 minutes, 11 seconds. Japan's Yukihiro Kitaoka finished second and defending champion Mubarak Hassan Shami from Qatar (formerly Kenyan Richard Yatich), claimed the bronze. The final day's results took China's gold medal haul to 199 and their overall tally to 416, beating theirs and the Games' previous best of 183 gold medals set at Beijing in 1990. ""The reason why we have been largely successful is related to the rise of our nation, along with the constant rise of China's economy and our comprehensive national strength. This medal haul again can represent a major achievement in our preparations for the London Olympic Games,"" China's vice minister of sport Duan Shijie said, AFP reported. South Korea finished in second place with 232 medals, 76 of them gold.

"Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- Alpha Conde said Monday in a speech to supporters at his home that his victory in last week's presidential runoff will result in ""a new era"" for Guinea. ""Tonight marks a new era for our country, the hour of change that millions of Guineans have strived for years to achieve,"" he said in a victory speech in the Mafonco neighborhood of Conakry. He delivered the speech shortly after the president of the Independent National Electoral Commission declared he was the victor in last week's tightly contested presidential election, the first in the West African republic's 52-year history. Outside Conde's residence, hundreds of cheering supporters surrounded his house in jubilation. About eight soldiers who made up his security contingent fired their AK-47s into the air in celebration. The announcement capped a day of violence in the capital city of Conakry during which supporters of Conde and challenger Cellou Dalein Diallo claimed victory in the November 7 runoff election. Shortly after Conde declared he had won, Diallo said he was the winner. In the melee that followed, security forces fired on supporters of Diallo in the Bambeto area of Conakry, killing three people, a spokesman for the military police said. Gunfire could be heard throughout the day as demonstrators set tires afire in an attempt to block roads and threw stones at security forces armed in riot gear as they patrolled the streets in pickup trucks. The forces fired tear gas and live ammunition against demonstrators, many of them boys who had thrown stones and then retreated into buildings. Though most of the streets were open, most of the stores were closed on Monday, a day before a Muslim holiday, when shoppers would typically be out in force stocking up on foodstuffs. The U.S.-based Carter Center and a European Union election group both monitored last week's election and said they had found no major problems. ""The Carter Center congratulates Guineans for the peaceful and orderly conduct of voting and the high level of participation,"" the Carter Center said last week. ""The successful voting process is an overwhelming testament of Guineans' profound desire to express their will at the ballot box and to complete their historic democratic transition."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged Guineans to ""accept the results ... and resolve any differences through legal means."" In a statement, he said the republic had the United Nations' full support, and urged individual countries ""to provide Guinea with concrete support as the country embarks on a new phase towards peace, consolidation and development."" But supporters of Diallo said voter fraud was widespread, with more ballots cast in certain areas than there were people registered to vote. In other cases, they said, they had evidence that ballots that had been filled out at the polling places differed from the ballots that were submitted to the central counting location in Conakry. Violence surrounding the election has an ethnic dimension: Conde is an ethnic Malinke and Diallo a Peul. The election results had initially been due last Wednesday, but Gen. Siaka Toumani Sangare, who heads the Independent National Electoral Commission, said he was delaying them to give time to consider election complaints that had been posed by both sides. Early results showed many Guineans voted along ethnic and regional lines, with the ethnic Peul, also known as Fulani, supporting the Peul candidate, Diallo, and the Malinke strongly in favor of their candidate, Conde. As winner, Conde will get unparalleled access to lucrative mining contracts for the ruling party. In the past, Guinean presidents have favored their own ethnic groups, which is why many have openly worried that their community would be shut out of the resources if they lose. But others were more hopeful that Guinea's democratic transition from the military junta that took power in 2008 would take place peacefully. ""The Guinean population from all the regions has witnessed war in the neighboring countries and has received displaced people, and I don't think they want to be in that position,"" Mamadou Camara, a computer engineer in Conakry, told CNN Thursday. Guinea, rich in minerals, is one of the poorest countries in Africa. Its new president will have to deal with myriad infrastructure problems, like the widespread lack of electricity and running water.","NEW: U.N.

"(CNN) -- At least two Americans, two Frenchmen and one Canadian were kidnapped early Monday by an armed group that raided an oil rig off the Nigerian coast. Two crew members are in stable condition at a shore-based clinic, where they were airlifted after being wounded in the leg. The rig off the southern coast of Nigeria at Okoro field is run by Transocean and owned by London-based Afren PLC, which detailed the hostages' nationalities and said that five were believed to have been kidnapped. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley put the number of hostages at seven and confirmed that two are U.S. citizens. ""We (are), of course, concerned about their safety and hope for their immediate release,"" he said. ""We are working with Nigerian authorities ... to pursue their prompt release, and there's an investigation already under way."" Residents  of Silver Creek, Mississippi, described James Robertson, one of the men  kidnapped in the raid, as a ""real nice guy,"" according to CNN affiliate  WLBT. ""He's a great person, over there doing his job,"" said Larry Smith. Kacey  Slocum, who used to live down the road from Robertson, told WLBT that  she and others were praying for their neighbor's safe return. She added  that the nature of the raid made it all the more distressing. ""I never thought there would be pirates in 2010,"" said Slocum, whose husband also works offshore on a rig near South America. Drilling operations in the Okoro field off Nigeria have been temporarily suspended, both companies involved said. In a news release, Afren said a ""security breach"" occurred soon after its ""High Island VII jackup rig"" arrived but before drilling had commenced. ""The situation has not been resolved. Afren is doing everything it can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, and it is working with relevant agencies in the Nigerian government,"" Afren public relations spokesman James Henderson told CNN. The kidnappers haven't contacted Transocean, said Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for the Houston, Texas-based company. ""Clearly, the industry is on heightened alert,"" Cantwell said. ""We're in wait-and-see mode."" Transocean operates six offshore rigs in Nigeria -- two deepwater rigs, two ultra-deepwater rigs and two shallow water rigs, including the one involved in the incident -- according to Cantwell. The company has  ""taken additional safety precautions"" on its other assets in the west African nation, he added. There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, and Nigerian officials would not comment about the incident. Several militant groups in the oil-rich Niger Delta have been battling the government for years over the distribution of the country's oil wealth. One of the largest such groups -- the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta -- is known for its kidnappings of oil workers. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Neighbors of a hostage from Silver Creek, Mississippi, call him a ""really nice guy""

"(CNN) -- While I was raised with conservative values, I grew up in a progressive town, Washington, D.C., where openly gay teachers were normal and a pregnancy didn't mean you had to visit a cousin in Europe for nine months. I'm fiscally conservative and socially liberal. As I wait for the final presidential wrestling match Monday night, I'm three debates down, drowning in attack ads, and I still don't know who to vote for. Debates are great fodder for Jon Stewart and SNL's ""Weekend Update"" (who doesn't love a good babbling-Biden joke?), but for me, the debates haven't changed anything. President Obama is less of a rock star than he was four years ago. Still, in comparison to Mitt Romney, he's Aerosmith. I get the feeling that Obama has thought about the future of American youth and has made a clear effort to bring them into his cause. See what one undecided single woman is seeking . Let's face it, it's cool to vote for Obama. This is why any young celebrity supporting Romney will make headlines a la Lindsay Lohan and Stacey Dash. (Who is Stacey Dash? Here comes a joke in itself: She's best known for her role as ""Dee"" in the movie Clueless.) Ignoring the crash-and-burn and B-list celebrities on his side, I'm wondering: Why hasn't Romney made any effort for the youth vote? Romney reminds me of everyone's embarrassing Grandpa Eddie, who thinks gays can be ""turned"" and doesn't understand why you can't roll down your windows on an airplane. His ultra-conservative lifestyle -- his adherence to his faith's ban on drinking, his tendency to say ""shoot"" and ""darn it"" -- tells us he's from another generation. Opinion: Does Romney 'get' women who work? His now infamous ""47%"" confession didn't help. True, 47% of the nation wasn't going to vote for him anyway, but I don't want a president who thinks, ""Half of you are worthless -- but choose me!"" It's probably not the smartest political strategy to tell people they are incapable and then ask them for their vote. I'm the demographic Romney needs to win over: Young, female, undecided. My conservative side wants to like Mitt, but he's not making it easy. Don't tell me you're out of work and understand unemployment when you are worth $200 million and post-grads like me can't find a job. Don't say, ""Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that,"" like you're throwing out an old sofa. Planned Parenthood is not a ""that."" Give me something, anything, to work with. A recent ""Saturday Night Live"" skit had Jay Pharoah portraying Obama. He said, ""There's your choice, America: Stick with what's been barely working, or take your chances"" with Romney. Unfortunately, that's the best summary I've heard of the 2012 election. Opinion: The speech every woman should hear . Obama, my socially liberal side supports you, but what about the national debt? Hope and change were great slogans, but they are not plans. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... Am I voting for you when I should know better? Romney, show me you are human. Inform me with reason but connect to me with emotion. Use that connection to get your point across. I know your hair looks like it came off a Lego man, but there has to be more there than plastic. I may be young, but I'm certainly not worthless, and I'm not in the ""47%."" In fact, I'm the most valuable American Romney could have: 100% undecided. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cat del Valle Castellanos.","I'm fiscally conservative, socially liberal and undecided, says Cat del Valle Castellanos .

"(CNN) -- Taiwan has rallied behind a taekwondo athlete who was controversially disqualified at the Asian Games in China, setting up Internet support groups and even burning South Korean flags. The island's ruling administration was also criticized for its response to the incident, which saw Yang Shu-chun disqualified while leading during a match in the women's 49-kilogram category in Guangzhou on Tuesday. The Asian Taekwondo Union released a statement accusing gold-medal hopeful Yang of a ""shocking act of deception,"" claiming that she had illegally added two extra sensors to the heel of her socks to help score more points. The ATU rejected an appeal from the Taiwan team and subsequently banned Yang and the two coaches involved pending a hearing by the martial art's world ruling body. Local politicians from the People First Party burned South Korean flags outside Taiwan's Sports Affairs Council in the capital on Thursday, the Taipei Times reported, in protest against World Taekwondo Federation secretary-general Yang Jin-suk. They also smashed imported products on the floor before police intervened, the newspaper said. Politicians from both the Democratic Progressive Party and the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) backed the 25-year-old in separate press conferences, the Taipei Times reported. ""Every signature symbolizes the gold medal awarded by the Taiwanese public to Yang,"" the KMT's Lin Yi-shih said of a campaign in support of the athlete. The DPP criticized Taiwan's Sports Affairs Council -- which on Wednesday threatened to take the matter to an international court -- for failing to stand up for Yang, despite its members being present in China. ""A large number of officials attended the Games, but all they have done so far is appear at and partake in the ceremonies when our athletes win. When Yang was disqualified, what did they do? Nothing,"" legislator Chiu Yi-ying said. DPP chairperson Tsai Ing-wen added in an online statement: ""[This government], especially on sovereignty issues, has always deferred to China and hasn't emphasized our attitudes enough. ""As a result, we think that it is regrettable that frontline officials haven't been speaking strongly enough about this incident."" Fan pages backing Yang on social networking website Facebook received more than 200,000 responses, according to the Taipei-based Central News Agency. And more than 1,100 people have pledged to turn up when Yang returns to Taiwan on Sunday, the Taipei Times said. Yang, 25, again insisted she was innocent, CNA reported on Thursday. ""I entered the competition area after the official inspecting my electronic footwear gave his approval in a pre-game inspection,"" she said. Meanwhile, China extended its lead in the medal table at the halfway stage of the 16th staging of the four-yearly Asian Games on Thursday. Its athletes claimed a further 12 gold medals on day six for 109 in total and 203 medals overall. South Korea added eight golds to be second with 37, while Japan collected four more to stay third on 21. North Korea and Iran remained on five golds, while Taiwan was joined on four by Kazakhstan and Hong Kong.","Taiwan politicians take up the cause of Yang Shu-chun after Asian Games incident .

"(CNN) -- Voter registration begins in Sudan on Monday for a January referendum that would allow the country's autonomous southern region -- which holds a majority of the nation's oil -- to secede from the north. A United Nations panel has arrived in the East African nation to monitor the 17-day registration effort, which will take place at 3,000 sites across the country and in eight countries abroad, the U.N. said. ""We know that organizing voter registration has not been easy, given the country's size and the scale of the process, but we remain confident that it can be completed successfully,"" Benjamin Mkapa, chairman of the U.N. panel and a former president of Tanzania, said in a statement Sunday. The referendum is part of a 2005 peace agreement, which ended the two-decade conflict that led to the deaths of 2 million people in Sudan. It is considered a possible make-or-break event for the peace accord. And the vote also could be a key factor as U.S. officials weigh whether to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Earlier this month, the Obama administration told Sudanese officials that the U.S. would drop the country from the list in mid-2011 if President Omar al-Bashir's government recognizes the results of the secession referendum, senior State Department officials said. Observers fear all-out war between the Khartoum-controlled north and southern Sudan if the government is perceived to have undermined the voting or refuses to accept the result. Darfur, in western Sudan, has been beset by conflict since 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Arab militias with ties to the Sudanese government went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have fled their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high. A recent renewal of violence between the Sudanese government and armed movements has sparked concern among U.N. peacekeepers, said Ibrahim Gambari, who heads the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur. ""I call upon all parties to refrain from further offensive military action and respect international humanitarian law,"" Gambari told reporters Sunday, according to a statement released by the U.N. CNN's Yousuf Basil and Catherine E. Shoichet  contributed to this report.","A U.N. panel is monitoring the 17-day registration effort .

"Léogâne, Haiti (CNN)  -- Joanie Yestin walks through a small alleyway to what used to be home, now a pile of concrete and crushed belongings. A plastic flower arrangement still hangs on an exterior wall that didn't collapse in the earthquake. One wooden bathroom cabinet survived. Standing amid the rubble, Yestin, 23, recalls that horrific day: She had just returned home from her job as a secretary at Léogâne's Cool FM radio station and was preparing to take a bath when the earth started rumbling. She rushed out in time, stood with her mother and watched showers of concrete. When the ground became still, she went back in to search for her father. A block had fallen on him. He died almost instantly. After she buried him, after she found a small plot of land outside a local school to set up temporary shelter, Yestin thought about what she might do to mend her broken soul, her broken nation. She put on her salvaged Girl Scout uniform -- a tan cotton blouse and skirt and a green scarf twisted around her neck. Yestin, like many of Haiti's almost 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts, decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort. ""It's important to have Haitians involved in the recovery,"" said Georges Clement, the Scout leader in Léogâne. ""We want to help."" Full coverage of Haiti earthquake . Since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in the 1980s, Haiti has created many civil society organizations and groups, but none has been particularly strong in the midst of political and economic turmoil, said Sophie Perez, the country director for the humanitarian agency CARE, which has worked in Haiti since 1954. It was vital to involve grass-roots groups in the earthquake recovery process, she said, because local people are the ones who have the biggest stake in the future. The Scouts have one other advantage: They are young. ""It is important to involve young people right from the start,"" Perez said. ""They can learn values of solidarity and good governance."" But as determined as Yestin is to help, this particular community chore is hardly easy for her Scout troop. In Baussan, a village near Léogâne, about 30 miles west of Port-au-Prince, the Scouts lined up to distribute essential hygiene items trucked in by CARE. Yestin and her friends broke out in a song about being together; it was the only way to get through life's tribulations. She smiled and laughed with the others. And yet not one among them had been unscathed by the terrible tragedy that befell Haiti on January 12. Many had lost a family member or a home. By day, few are in school. By night, they sleep under the stars. No one's lives are the way they were anymore. The missing, the found, the victims . Yestin handed out red, green and blue buckets filled with soap, toothpaste, towels. She tore open the plastic-on-foam mattresses and blankets to hand out to the needy. She tried not to think about her own loss at that moment. ""It was God's will"" that her father died, she had said earlier. ""I will do my very best to help others because that is what I have been trained to do,"" she said about her five years in the Scouts. ""Up until now, I haven't really had the opportunity to help others."" Yestin passed along one CARE bucket after another. She did not cry like she did when the earth shook. Or worry that her education was in peril. She had wanted to attend university, study communications. But it was her father who made a living as a mason. Who will pay her tuition now? Who will support her 5-year-old nephew? His unemployed parents depended on her for a few extra dollars. She often feels scared these days when she is alone. ""I love the way we work together,"" she said of the Scouts. So on this blazing afternoon, amid the despair of the needy, she simply took comfort.","Many of Haiti's 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts contribute to earthquake relief .

"(CNN) -- China is proposing to convene an emergency consultation with members of the six-party talks amid growing tensions on the Korean peninsula, a Chinese official and an American official said Sunday. ""The Chinese side, after careful studies, proposes to have emergency consultations among the heads of delegation to the six-party talks in early December in Beijing to exchange views on major issues of concern to the parties at present,"" Wu Dawei, Chinese special representative for Korean peninsula affairs, told journalists. ""The six-party talks play an important role in strengthening communication among the parties, advancing denuclearization on the peninsula and safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula and in northeast Asia,"" he said. As both North Korea's largest trading partner and a country engaged in diplomatic talks with South Korea, China is dealing with both sides of an increasingly divided Korean peninsula. Diplomats, seeking a lessening of tensions and a return to the six-party talks with North Korea over the country's nuclear aspirations, have busily labored to avert more hostilities. The United States, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and North Korea are the six countries that have been involved in the discussions, which were put on hold in 2008. ""The United States is consulting with South Korea, Japan and other countries on China's proposal for emergency talks on the North Korean crisis,"" a State Department spokesperson told CNN Sunday. ""The six-party talks cannot substitute for action by North Korea to comply with its obligations,"" said the spokesperson, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. ""Clear steps by North Korea are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior."" ""We have called on China to urge North Korea to restrain its provocations and responsibly act in the interests of peace and stability,"" the spokesperson said. China said the proposed emergency consultations do not mean a resumption of the six-party talks, China's state media reported. The South Korean government will ""bear in mind"" China's proposal, according to a Foreign Ministry press release. But the government added that given the current situation, the proposal ""needs to be carefully reviewed."" U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that China is the key to resolving the conflict, but said the country is ""not behaving as a responsible world power."" ""They could bring the North Korean economy to its knees if they wanted to. And I cannot believe that the Chinese should, in a mature fashion, not find it in their interest to restrain North Korea. So far, they are not,"" McCain said. McCain called the proposal for a six-party meeting a ""fine first step,"" but said that North Korea's history of confrontation will not come to a stop without significant penalties. Tensions on the Korean peninsula mounted last week when four South Koreans died after North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island during a South Korean military drill Tuesday. North Korea said the South provoked the attack because shells from the South Korean drill landed in the North's waters. ""We express our condolences to the victims of the Yeonpyeong island incident and will make efforts for the sake of peace between North and South Korea so that the situation does not deteriorate,"" Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo said during a meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Sunday. The South Korean president asked that China ""contribute to achieving peace on the Korean peninsula with a fairer and responsible position in regards to North and South Korean relations."" Lee added that ""South Korea has endured endless provocations from the North since the Korean War, but if North Korea carries out an additional provocation, we will take strong countermeasures."" On Sunday, South Korea and the United States began joint military exercises on the Yellow Sea -- another point of contention in the region. North Korea has warned of unpredictable ""consequences"" if the United States fulfilled its vow of deploying an aircraft carrier to the Yellow Sea for the military maneuvers. ""The DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] will deal a merciless military counter-attack at any provocative act of intruding into its territorial waters in the future,"" North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Sunday. China appeared to have criticized the joint military exercises last week. ""We oppose any party to take any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. The China-North Korea relations take another step on Tuesday, when Choe Tae Bok, chairman of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, will pay an official visit to China, Xinhua reported. Choe was invited by Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, the agency said. CNN's Steven Jiang and journalist Jiyeon Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: State Department spokesman says U.S. conferring with others on ""North Korea crisis""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Tensions between the Koreas remained high Friday as China appeared to criticize the U.S.-South Korean military exercise set to begin Sunday in the Yellow Sea off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. ""We oppose any party to take any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. He said that international law of the sea says that an exclusive economic zone stretches 200 nautical miles from the coast. The United States is sending the aircraft carrier USS George Washington to join South Korea's forces near the coasts of China and North Korea in the four-day drill. It is set to begin five days after North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing four South Koreans and wounding 15 others. North Korea said the South provoked the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. South Korea was holding its annual Hoguk military drill when the North started its shelling. Xinhua quoted Chinese scholars who also criticized the planned drill by U.S. and South Korean (Republic of Korea) forces. ""The United States and ROK should not take sensitive and provocative military actions at such a sensitive time and place,"" said Major General Luo Yuan, a researcher with the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Military Science Academy. He likened the planned exercise to ""pouring oil onto flames."" But China, North Korea's largest trading partner, also called for an easing of tensions. ""As the Korean Peninsula situation is highly complicated and sensitive, all parties concerned should stay calm and exercise restraint,"" Hong said. The United States has looked to China to exert its influence on North Korea to ratchet back tensions in the region. But there was no indication that plan was working. North Korea continued its war rhetoric, saying Friday that South Korea and the United States are recklessly pushing the Korean peninsula toward war by scheduling the joint military drill to begin this weekend. ""The situation on the Korean peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war due to the reckless plan of those trigger-happy elements to stage again the war exercises targeted against [North Korea] in wake of the grave military provocation they perpetrated against the territorial waters of [the North Korean] side in the West Sea,"" said the North's official KCNA news agency. The West Sea, part of the Yellow Sea that is nearest to the Koreas, was the scene of Tuesday's shelling. ""The army and people of [North Korea] are now greatly enraged at the provocation of the puppet group, while getting fully ready to give a shower of dreadful fire and blow up the bulwark of the enemies if they dare to encroach again upon [North Korea's] dignity and sovereignty even in the least,"" KCNA said Friday. ""The group should not run amok, clearly understanding the will and mettle of the highly alerted army and people of [North Korea] to wipe out the enemies."" Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi met Friday with North Korean Ambassador to China Chi Jae Ryong and talked with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan, Xinhua said. ""They exchanged views on issues including the situation of the Korean Peninsula,"" according to a statement released Friday night by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, it added. The United States has condemned the attack on Yeonpyeong Island and affirmed its military commitments to South Korea. Also Friday, South Korea named a new defense minister to replace the official who resigned Thursday amid criticism due to North Korea's sinking of a warship in March and Tuesday's deadly shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. South Korea's government nominated Kim Kwan-jin as defense minister, a Blue House media official told CNN. The National Assembly is to hold a confirmation hearing on the 61-year-old Kim, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2006 to 2008, prior to his retirement. South Korean and U.S. forces plan to drill in the Yellow Sea from Sunday until Wednesday. The United States has described the drill as defensive in nature. The exercises were planned months ago, and are meant to underscore strong ties between South Korea and the United States, defense officials from both countries have said. All but about 30 of the island's 1,300 residents have evacuated, with most of them moving to the South Korean mainland, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. About 100 soldiers and workers also were on the island, doing cleanup and repairs. The North appeared to have carefully targeted Tuesday's attack, a key South Korean lawmaker said Friday after a visit to Yeonpyeong Island. ""My hunch is that North Korea was picking and choosing its aiming point, they are very focused,"" said South Korean Congresswoman Song Young-sun, an influential member of the National Assembly's Defense Committee. ""They attacked gas station, helicopter pad and command and control sites and water tanks. Everything that is directly related to military operations, they have completely smashed."" Asked why North Korea might have attacked, she said: ""I think they are doing this training for dual purposes. One is for South Korea: They are arbitrarily suggesting the different maritime border line from our Northern Limit Line. They are trying to verify what they demand, so they are doing exercises and training."" The expected forthcoming succession of power from North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il to his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, also plays into it, Song said. ""What Kim Jong Un wants to demonstrate is his influence and his exertion of power, because he needs in a very speedy time to prove within the next couple of years that he is strong and qualified to succeed,"" she said. The South has scrambled as a result of Tuesday's shelling. The Cheonan sinking sparked a public uproar, with many saying that it should not have been possible for North Korea to have damaged South Korea's more modern military. North Korea has denied involvement in the sinking. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak drew criticism for his initial statements after the Yeonpyeong bombardment, when he asked for a stern response but also called for de-escalatory measures to be taken. Later that day, Lee spoke to the military and urged heavy retaliation. South Korea said Thursday it will strengthen its rules of engagement in the Yellow Sea. South Korean marine forces based in five islands near North Korea and the disputed Northern Limit Line also will be reinforced, a government spokesman said. The tense maritime border between the two Koreas has become the major military flash point on the Korean peninsula in recent years. The Yeonpyeong attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting, though both Koreas are still technically at war.

"(CNN) -- Eddie Lovelace's symptoms were subtle at first, almost imperceptible -- a headache now and then, a little dizziness in the first week of September. A healthy 78-year-old circuit court judge in Albany, Kentucky, Lovelace didn't want to go to the doctor, and he certainly didn't seem terribly ill. As usual, he worked more than a full day every day except Sunday, and walked at least three miles. But then on September 9, Lovelace became confused while teaching his regular Sunday school class at the Albany First Baptist Church and had to stop partway through. Two days later, he went to pick up his newspaper and fell over onto the sidewalk. He said he couldn't feel his legs, and his daughter rushed him to the emergency room. Fearing he'd had a stroke, doctors at Clinton County Hospital sent him by ambulance to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, where an MRI confirmed he had indeed had a stroke. Lovelace died five days later, his death attributed to a combination of old age and bad luck. At his funeral, Kentucky Chief Justice John Minton eulogized Lovelace, remembering his 20 years on the bench and his 23 years as a state prosecutor. Lovelace's granddaughter played a hymn on the piano, and he was buried at the Memorial Hill Cemetery, with Joyce, his wife of 55 years, their two children, five grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter in attendance. As she sat in the church, Lovelace's daughter, Karen Talbott, couldn't get something out of her mind. She's a nurse, and while her father was at Vanderbilt, not one but several doctors took her aside and told her his stroke was in a part of the brain where strokes hardly ever happen -- and when they do, it's in patients with severe, prolonged high blood pressure. The judge's blood pressure was normal, even a little low. ""This is the strangest stroke I've ever seen,"" they told her. 'Bitter, angry, and heartbroken' Right now, doctors in 23 states are looking back at medical records to reconsider whether deaths that looked routine might actually have been caused by contaminated medicine from the New England Compounding Center. ""There will be people who gradually come to light -- people like this judge,"" says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt who's been working with the Tennessee Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control during the outbreak. What is a compounding pharmacy? Lovelace died on September 17, more than a week before doctors -- and the rest of the world -- learned about the contaminated shots. Then, three weeks later, Lovelace's son-in-law, Bob Talbott, read a short article online in The Tennessean newspaper, which said a 78-year-old man was the first to die in the meningitis outbreak. The date of death was listed as September 17 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Talbott called Lovelace's widow, Joyce, immediately. It must be Eddie, he said -- how many other 78-year-old men could have died at Vanderbilt on September 17? But no one from Vanderbilt or the state department of health had reached out to the family. Then Joyce remembered receiving a telephone call a week after her husband's death from someone at the St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center in Nashville, where her husband had had three steroid injections for neck and back pain over the summer. The caller wanted to know how ""Brother Eddie"" was doing. ""I said, 'Well, Brother Eddie passed away,' and they said they were sorry and everything, and that was the end of the call,"" Joyce remembers. ""Then the next day I got a call from the same number and it was a different individual. She wanted to know about his symptoms and whether an autopsy had been done."" Steroid injections common for back pain sufferers . Joyce thought the calls were a little odd -- she wondered why they were inquiring about her husband's health nearly a month after they gave him the injections. The callers never mentioned the words ""fungal meningitis,"" she says, even though the connection between the shots and the disease had been made by that time. CNN tried through e-mails and phone calls to get answers from the St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, but did not receive a response. Only after reading the Tennessean article did Joyce put it all together. The St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center received 2,000 vials of tainted steroids, and some 1,000 patients received the injections between June 6 and September 6, according to the St. Thomas Hospital. Lovelace received his three injections in July and August. ""I've been bitter, angry, heartbroken, and grief-stricken,"" Joyce says. Vanderbilt reported Lovelace's death as one of four ""suspected"" cases of meningitis, according to hospital spokesman Craig Boerner. A strict judge, a loving grandfather . Some 14,000 people may have received shots of contaminated medicine from the New England Compounding Center, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Since it can take as long as seven weeks for symptoms to show up after a patient receives a shot, it's possible some of them are experiencing symptoms such as headaches and dizziness and haven't connected them to the shots they received. Meningitis outbreak: What you need to know . ""It's important to make that connection, because the earlier you treat this, the better,"" says Dr. Howard Kirshner, vice chairman of the Department of Neurology at Vanderbilt, who has treated patients in this outbreak. That's why Joyce Lovelace says she's speaking out -- she doesn't want anyone else to suffer the way her husband did. Eddie Lovelace and Joyce Davis were college sweethearts and married 56 years ago this December. She worked as a lab technician while he attended law school at the University of Louisville, graduating in 1960. ""Those were rough years. We didn't have money or anything, but they were good years,"" Joyce remembers. After graduation, Lovelace went to work as an attorney for the city of Albany and then as a county and state prosecutor. He was a circuit court judge from 1992 until he passed away, and was named Kentucky Trial Judge of the Year in 1995. Lovelace worked seven days a week, cutting down only recently to six. ""He loved the law,"" Joyce says. ""He was the most intelligent man I've ever met,"" his son, Chris Lovelace, says. ""If you needed advice, regardless of what the subject was, you could always take his and trust it and rest assured that things would work out."" The lawyers who argued cases before him remembered how well prepared he was -- and that his decisions were rarely reversed by appellate courts. FDA: More issues with drugs from Mass. facility . ""He believed in proper courtroom decorum and had a respect for the legal system and for the office he held,"" David Cross, an Albany lawyer, wrote in an article in The Wayne County Outlook. ""He will be remembered as one of the most influential figures in our county's history."" Lovelace's family remembers him as a loving father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He sometimes took his granddaughters to work with him, letting them play with their Barbie dolls quietly behind him on the bench while he heard cases. Lovelace's term as judge would have ended in two years, and he had planned on opening a law practice with one of those granddaughters, Megan Lovelace Thompson, who recently graduated from law school. ""He was really looking forward to that,"" Joyce says. ""He had many more years -- good years."" Now the entire family has to figure out how to live on without the man they describe as ""the center of our universe."" ""I was married when I was 19. I don't remember what it's like not to be married,"" Joyce says. ""It was such a useless death."" CNN's Trisha Henry and William Hudson contributed to this report.","Judge Eddie Lovelace initially was thought to have died of a stroke .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Chanting ""give us our time back,"" thousands of people in eastern Russia Saturday protested proposed changes to the country's time zones, state media reported. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has proposed time zone reforms that would further cut the time difference between the region and Moscow, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. Already, similar reforms implemented earlier this year have led to dark winter skies in the middle of the day in the region, the news agency said. More than 3,000 protesters flocked to the central square in the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, RIA-Novosti said. As a result of the changes, the consumption of electric energy already has increased in schools and other institutions, with many extracurricular groups shut down, protesters told RIA-Novosti. Older people are affected particularly negatively by the change, they argued, demanding a nationwide referendum to resolve the issue. In March, Russia -- the world's largest country by land mass -- cut the number of time zones in the country from 11 to 9. ""The less fractional division of the country will enable us to resolve a number of transport and communications issues, will increase its manageability and strengthen the position of Russia as an important chain in the world's global infrastructure,""  Medvedev said at a special Kremlin meeting devoted to the issues of time change. As part of the reform, five Russian regions -- two in European Russia and three in Siberia -- did not join the rest of the country in moving the clock one hour forward to daylight saving time, thus coming a little closer to Moscow. Some local governments of the regions where the time zone change will take place had lobbied for the measure for years and overwhelmingly supported the proposed federal initiative. In his 2009 State of the Nation address, Medvedev proposed an even more radical reform. He suggested not only cutting the number of time zones in Russia, but also abolishing the current switch to daylight saving time, which the country has been doing since 1981. Throughout this year, government officials and scientists will closely examine the consequences of the time reform in the five Russian regions, and a further reduction of time zones in Russia might take place in future if the experiment proves positive, according to Medvedev. The president has also called upon experts to finalize their studies on the possible effects of abolishing the daylight saving time in Russia by February 2011. CNN's Mila Sanina and Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has proposed time zone reforms .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- At least 13 people were killed and 20 wounded when lightning struck a makeshift mosque in a remote village in northeast Bangladesh on Friday, police said. The lightning strike occurred as people gathered for a special evening prayer known as taraweeh that is conducted during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ""Multiple lightning strikes occurred during a storm when nearly 35 people gathered at a house in the village of Saraswati where they turned a tin roof shed into a makeshift mosque for the month of Ramadan as a regular mosque was far away,"" Dharmapasha police chief Bayes Alam told CNN. The village Saraswati is some 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital of Dhaka. Heavy rains in recent weeks have swollen the Saraswati River, making access to the village difficult. ""As boats were the only mode of transport to go out of the village, it took several hours to take the critically wounded people to the hospital,"" said Akm Mezanul Haque, the officer-in-charge of the Modhyanagar police station, who joined the rescue operation. Of the 13 killed by the lightning strike, Mohammad Shahabuddin, the imam, and two others died at the mosque, Alam said. Ten others were declared dead at a Dharmapasha area hospital, he said. Area residents and police took the wounded, many in critical condition, to the area hospital.","A lightning strike occurred as people gathered for evening prayers, police said .

Sandy and Jeff Clubb, a university athletic director and a local private school teacher, were chosen to host the president in Des Moines, Iowa, as part of the White House's series of informal discussions on the economy leading up to the midterm elections. I met the Clubbs in their driveway at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday. It was still dark outside. I was among a small group of reporters in the first wave to arrive before the president's entourage. Sandy Clubb was excited to see her assistant from the university arrive with pastries in hand for her special guests. I asked Sandy how all this had come about. She said a week ago, they had been informed that they were being considered as ""one of eight families the White House was looking at to possibly host the president's visit to Des Moines."" At 5:15 Thursday evening, White House advance staffer Mike Ruemmler called to say the Clubbs had been chosen. Sandy Clubb said 45 minutes later, about a dozen local and White House officials arrived at their home, including the Secret Service, to brief their family and scout out the backyard. ""It's like winning the lottery,"" Jeff Clubb said, ""but without even buying a ticket."" The couple say they are baffled about how they even made the list to be considered. They are both registered Democrats who voted for Obama, but neither of them campaigned or raised money for the candidate. Jeff Clubb, a former Arizona resident, says he voted for John McCain for senator when he lived there. The White House often looks for people who have a good life story and have benefited from the administration's policies. The Clubbs fit the bill, as middle-class parents of two young children, Tristan 11, and Skyelar 9. Jeff is a former firefighter who now teaches social studies and religion at Holy Trinity Catholic School. Sandy is the athletic director at Drake University. Jeff says he was told the White House wanted to hold the event in Beaverdale, a sprawling suburb of Des Moines, because of its beautiful big oak trees, which Obama admired during the event. ""This is a lovely neighborhood. I love these big trees,"" the president said. Sandy Clubb said she was told, ""It all came down to your backyard."" Indeed the Clubbs do have a beautiful acre full of oaks, elms, maples, evergreens and pines. After their home was selected, the Clubbs frantically prepared for the president. Jeff moved an old car he was working on out of the garage to make room for the White House press corps to set up shop. The morning of the event, Sandy was looking for a place to hide Mouse, their cat. She settled on her daughter's bedroom. ""I didn't want it running through the president's legs"" Sandy said. Their other feline, Oreo, had been boarded earlier in the week. The Clubbs set out bananas, apples, coffee and orange juice for their guests. They say they're not getting paid for anything. Jeff said one of the biggest challenges was finding and filling the 85 seats needed for the event. He said he was told the family could invite ""anyone they wanted; neighbors, friends, of any political affiliation."" Jeff's parents and sister were already planning to come into town Friday for their family reunion, so they decided to move their arrival up three days so they could meet the president. Jeff and Sandy then invited their neighbors on the condition they bring their own chairs. All week, the Clubbs had accepted a variety of lawn chairs, which made up the motley assortment of wood, iron and plastic furniture sprawled over the backyard. Jeff says one of his neighbors, who's a Republican, brought over his own chair. ""He's not coming to the event, but he said, 'This is the president of the United States -- of course I want my chair there. I want to be represented.'

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Buenos Aires, Argentina, are investigating clashes between authorities and homeless squatters in a vacant park that left three people dead and 14 others injured last week, state media reported. Four men were still in the hospital Monday -- one in serious condition -- after authorities cracked down on groups of homeless people who tried to illegally take park lands to start building houses, the state-run Telam news agency said. The clashes grew so violent that Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner sent in National Guard troops to surround the park, where government estimates indicate more than 1,600 families are camped. Authorities say many of the squatters are illegal immigrants, and the physical clashes have also become a tense political standoff between the federal government and city authorities in a nation that frequently attracts low-wage migrants from other South American countries. Alejandro Salvatierra told reporters that many of the squatters were promised homes by the government 10 year ago, but are still searching for a solution that would give them a dignified place to live. ""This situation is a desperate one that made us take the decision we did,"" he said, adding that, ""we will not leave the park until we have our housing."" Standing beside a table displaying rocks, wooden sticks and even a gun that authorities recovered from the scene, Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez Fernandez blamed the conflict on Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri, Telam reported. ""The national government would like to publicly condemn the criminal acts of political activists,"" said Julio Alak, Argentina's security and justice minister. Federal officials have called Macri a ""xenophobe"" for saying the conflict was because of ""uncontrolled immigration"" of illegal immigrants from neighboring South American countries, including Bolivia and Paraguay, the agency said. But they say it is Macri's responsibility to resolve the problem, since a government census revealed that a large majority of residents in the park come from the city. ""Now the government has to take responsibility of what happens in the park premises. In the meantime, the national government will take charge of keeping the peace in the area,"" said Alicia Kirchner, Argentina's minister of social development, according to Telam.","A government census says more than 1,600 families are in the park .

"(CNN) -- The hijacking of a container ship in the Indian Ocean Friday afternoon is evidence of a ""constantly expanding area of pirate activity"" off the Africa coast, military officials said. At least five pirates, using two small boats and a rocket-propelled grenade, boarded the MV Panama, a Liberian-flagged vessel operated by a U.S. company, according to a statement by the European Union Naval Force Somalia. The attack happened about 80 nautical miles east of the Tanzanian-Mozambique border, the statement said. ""This extreme southerly attack in the Somali Basin is a further example of the constantly expanding area of pirate activity,"" it said. Pirate attacks have become a frequent hazard for sailors off Somalia, which has had no effective central government since 1991. The merchant vessel was sailing from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to Beira, Mozambique, when the pirates attacked, it said. There was not immediate word of the condition of the 23 crew members, who are all from Myanmar, it said. The European Union Naval Force Somalia is a multinational task force with the mission to escort merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid of the World Food Program and vessels of the African Union Mission in Somalia. The mission is ""to protect vulnerable ships in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean and to deter and disrupt piracy,"" it said. Despite a crackdown by an international naval flotilla in the region, pirates managed to seize 35 ships in the region between January and September, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors attacks.","5 pirates board the MV Panama Friday off Tanzania .

"(CNN) -- Sao Paulo has confirmed it will complete the signing of Brazil playmaker Paulo Henrique Ganso from Santos in a deal worth an estimated $12 million. The 22-year-old midfielder will put pen to paper on a five-year contract after the two clubs came to an agreement late on Thursday. The Brazil international has made just 26 appearances this year after suffering from knee and muscles problems. He missed seven months of the 2010 season after undergoing surgery on his left knee before returning to form. Alongside Neymar, Ganso helped Santos win the Brazilian Cup in 2010 and the Copa Libertadores in 2011. Sao Paulo football director Adalberto Baptista told the club website: ""Ganso showed throughout the negotiating a great willingness towards Sao Paulo. ""He gave up big things and was firm in his desire. If it wasn't for his desire, we would had given up."" ""It's a dream come true,'' Ganso was reported to have said by AP. ""Ever since Sao Paulo showed interest in signing me I wanted to get the deal done. I can't wait to get on the field and pay back for all the effort that the club directors put into this.'' Santos has also managed to negotiate a 5% sell-on fee into the deal after finally relenting in its stance of not selling Ganso to a rival. Several European clubs including Inter Milan, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur had reportedly shown interest in the player but no bids were received. The player made little secret of his desire to leave the club with fans launching protests after learning of his plans. Santos' failure to award him the same wage package as Neymar is thought to be the chief reason for Ganso's decision. The player will now hope to kick-start his career following a number of injury problems and a dip in form which cost him a place in Brazil's Olympic squad, where he was replaced by Chelsea playmaker Oscar. And with the World Cup arriving in Brazil in 2014, Ganso will plan to show national coach Mano Menezes he is ready to lead his country's challenge on home soil. .","Sao Paulo will pay around $12 million for Brazil star .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- The Nigerian military acknowledged Sunday that civilians may have been ""caught in the crossfire"" last week during an operation to root out criminal gangs in the country's Delta State. The armed forces began an offensive targeting alleged militant leader John Togo on Wednesday, attacking rebel camps near the village of Ayakoromo and dislodging some militants who had sought refuge in villagers' homes. The targeted group -- the Niger Delta Liberation Force -- has accused the military of large-scale massacre and rape in the village and surrounding areas, allegations that military spokesman Timothy Antigha called ""completely false."" ""It is possible a few civilians were caught in the crossfire,"" Antigha, a spokesman for the military's Joint Task Force, which was formed to combat rebels, said Sunday. A local official said he saw at least 10 villagers' bodies among the casualties. The task force released a statement Saturday saying ""there is no evidence on the ground to justify any claim of genocide against the JTF."" The statement acknowledged that buildings near the targeted camps became involved in the crossfire when fleeing militants took them over and exchanged gunfire with security forces. ""It is an established practice that civilian accommodation, offices, churches, mosques, hospitals, cultural places, shrines are non-military targets, but if they are used to stage an attack, such civilian accommodation or office automatically loses that immunity and becomes a military target,"" the statement said. As many as six soldiers were killed in the operation, Antigha said, and about 100 people were displaced. The operation has been suspended while the military assists affected residents, he said. The oil-rich Niger Delta has been the site of frequent clashes between militant groups and the Nigerian military. One of the most prominent rebel groups, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, and other militant groups say they're fighting for a fairer distribution of the region's oil wealth. Analysts say they are often paid by politicians to support their own bid for power.","Civilians may have been ""caught in the crossfire,"" official says .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture is considering sending federal veterinarians in Texas across the border into Mexico to inspect cattle, a practice that ended years ago over safety fears. Government workers have come out against the plan, confounded as to why they would be required to work in a Mexican state under a travel warning by the State Department because of carjackings and robberies. The USDA conducted a security assessment on the Mexican installation Friday, but have not made a final decision on whether to send veterinarians from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, to work there. The facility is located near the Colombia Solidarity Bridge, a rural international crossing near Laredo, Texas, that connects to the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. Mexico accuses U.S. in border shooting . According to its most recent travel warning, the State Department urges U.S. citizens to ""defer non-essential travel"" to the Nuevo Leon, except for the major hub of Monterrey, which itself carries other warnings. The closest major city to the facility is Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, a place known for the drug cartel violence that has been recorded there. A lawyer for the government veterinarians along the border said the federal workers are unwilling to work there because of fears of being kidnapped or killed. ""Nobody is holding a gun to their head ... yet,"" said Bill Hughes who represents the National Association of Federal Veterinarians, which opposes the plan. ""But USDA officials have told them in no uncertain terms that when they're assigned there they better go or there are going be serious consequences to their careers, such as losing their jobs."" In response to Hughes' claims, the USDA said it is not forcing employees into the assignment and that they will not send federal workers into an area not considered safe by the State Department. ""We are committed to making sure our employees fully understand the risks and are properly prepared to do their jobs,"" the USDA said in a statement to CNN. ""APHIS and the U.S. Department of State are currently conducting a security assessment of a new inspection facility, and once the site assessment is complete, we will determine our next steps."" Until March 2010, cattle inspections were routinely done in Mexico, but due to the rise in drug cartel violence along the border, U.S. authorities transferred inspections to U.S.-based facilities. During inspections veterinarians are tasked with clearing the cattle for fever ticks, hoof and mouth disease and other illnesses. ""The real question is, why would (the) USDA even be taking a chance? How much risk is acceptable to place its civilian employees into for even the slight convenience of having the animals inspected in Mexico?"" Hughes said. Decision makers at USDA are not bad people, Hughes said, ""But they're making a bad decision, or they're being pressured to make a bad decision, even though they may deny it. And these folks down there on the border are saying, 'I've been loyal to this agency, why are they doing this to me?'""

"(CNN) -- Somali lawmakers are scheduled to choose the next president Monday, moving the nation a step closer to its first stable central government since the 1991 ouster of a dictator. The new parliament, which was selected last month, will hold a ballot to choose the president from about two dozen candidates. In a letter to lawmakers, the United Nations called for a credible leader who can propel the African nation toward peace. ""After two decades of civil war, a collapsed state and innumerable indignities to the proud Somali people, we are hours away from the election of a new president,"" said Augustine P.

"(CNN) -- Rescuers in Iran worked furiously Tuesday to free people trapped under rubble, a day after a powerful earthquake rippled through a rural stretch of villages in the country's southeastern region, Iranian media reported. Iran's Press TV said aftershocks followed the 6.5 magnitude Monday quake that struck at least 70 villages in Kerman province. Iranian authorities recorded seven deaths and dozens of injuries so far, but authorities expect the casualty toll to rise in the quake -- just over 60 miles away from the site of a deadly tremor that killed 30,000 people seven years ago in the city of Bam. Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported that scores of people are trapped in the debris of buildings that have been destroyed. Many such sites are in hard-to-reach locations, making any rescue operations even more difficult. Are you there? Share earthquake stories with CNN iReport . Jessica Sigala, a U.S. Geological Survey physicist in Golden, Colorado, thinks the number of deaths could range from between 10 to 1,000, based on statistics and information about past earthquakes. She said that while this latest event was similar in magnitude to the Bam quake, which measured at 6.6 magnitude, the Monday quake struck a more remote region about 63 miles away from that city. ""That's an important thing to realize. That distance will help decrease the fatality rate as well as the damage,"" she said. ""There isn't a big city anywhere to be seen."" But, she said, that doesn't mean the quake wasn't felt through the region. In fact, said Kerman governor Esmail Najjar, the tremors were felt as far away as Hormozgan province, which lies on the Persian Gulf, and Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was also felt in Bam and other cities, such as Zahedan, Khash and Iranshahr. ""Considering the dimensions of the damage, the death toll is expected to rise,"" Najjar was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency. The high-impact zone's population -- which Najjar estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 people -- was widely dispersed. The quake's epicenter was around the town of Hosseinabad. Many of the structures in the quake-hit region use adobe as construction material, and that can crumble in earthquakes, Press TV reported. Photos in Iranian media showed pictures of rubble and people huddled outside damaged buildings. Images showed some bodies wrapped in sheets and people crying. Javad Kamali, a deputy governor for Kerman province, told the IRNA that the tremor knocked down phone lines throughout the region. Military and law enforcement workers could communicate only using wireless technology, he added. Relief and recovery teams, some from outside the area, have converged around the village of Hosseinabad, between the towns of Fahraj and Rigan, Kamali said. In addition, IRNA reported that Kerman province's disaster council convened an emergency meeting to assess possible damage and coordinate potential aid and assistance efforts. Iran lies on a series of seismic fault lines and experiences earthquakes almost daily, and at times, they have had devastating consequences, such as the quake in Bam. Last year, an earthquake struck Hormozgan province in southern Iran, injuring about 700 people in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state media reported. And there's been plenty of activity in recent months as well. In early November, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake in the northwestern Lorestan province injured at least 80 people, according to IRNA. One person died two months earlier when a quake measuring magnitude-5.5 struck southern Iran, and in August three were killed after a 5.7-magnitude tremor in northern Iran, several state news agencies reported.

"Chicago (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of Chicago schoolchildren will return to class Wednesday after the teachers union voted to suspend its strike. About 800 union officers and delegates met for just over two hours before there was an overwhelming voice vote to suspend the walkout, union leaders said Tuesday. The contract agreement with the school system still needs to be ratified by the more than 29,000 teachers and support staff who are members of the union. Karen Lewis, union president, said the rank and file will vote in ""the next couple of weeks."" Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest U.S. school system, and the union struck a tentative bargain Friday afternoon. But on Sunday, union members decided to continue the walkout while they reviewed the proposal. ""Well, I think it is the best deal we could get at this moment in time,"" Lewis said before the meeting. Afterwards, she said there was no such thing as a perfect contract, and that not every member of the union would be pleased. That included people like Benita Whitfield Shanklin, a social worker who voted no on Tuesday. ""I have two different feelings at the same time -- happy that we are so solid and we're a tight working unit,"" she said, ""but at the same time I'm sad that we weren't able to make any progress on class sizes and the school closures. We have a lot of parents that were supporting us, and I feel like we let them down."" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the new contract is ""an honest compromise."" Emanuel highlighted the fact that the new school day would be longer for many students. He said that a child who enters kindergarten under the terms of the new agreement would receive 2 1/2 more years of instruction by the time he graduated. ""In this contract we gave our children a seat at the table,"" he said at a news conference. Lewis told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that Emanuel had tried to bully her union members. ""The mayor had an education agenda he wanted to ram down our throats,"" she said. ""The fact is that we were still able to enjoin our members to move as one. And I think that powerful message (is) when you work together, you accomplish magnificent things. We still want to work with the board of education so we can accomplish what's really best for our kids."" Parents and city officials will be happy to send about 350,000 children back to class after they missed seven school days. ""I'm just glad that everyone got what they wanted but I just wanted the children to be first,"" Lisa Russell, a parent, told CNN affiliate WLS. ""And I believe they are first."" The school board posted a notice on its website: ""Chicago Teachers Union leadership has chosen to end the strike. All Chicago Public Schools will re-open on Wednesday, September 19, and all CPS students are expected to be back in the classroom."" David Vitale, chairman of the school board, said the new deal will transform the school system to the benefit of teachers and students. He acknowledged the negotiations weren't easy. ""You need to know that our engagement was totally professional, and while it was extremely hard work, the work was done with purpose and with intent, I believe, the get our kids back to school,"" he said. Darren Tuggle, who has taught high school English for 13 years, said the strike wasn't about money, rather it was about classroom conditions. He said that teachers were frustrated with the board, whose members are appointed and most of whom came from business backgrounds. ""More people are going to stand up to that,"" he said, referring to the situation in Chicago and to what he called the movement toward ""privatization nationwide."" He said the move to a longer instructional day was like making a bowl of soup into a larger bowl of soup: It only makes it bigger, not necessarily tastier. ""We need to really be looking at ways to make things better and doing it in a smart way,"" he said. ""There was no discussion about quality (from the school board)."" Q&A: What's behind the Chicago teachers' strike? Teachers walked off the job September 10, objecting to a longer school day, evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings. Parents have juggled their families' schedules for more than a week to make sure their children are attended to while schools are closed. One parent on the impact of the strike . This contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school-age students, 10 more ""instructional days"" each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system, as opposed to the two schedules now in place, depending on the school. The pay structure would change with a 3% pay increase for the first year of the contract, 2% for the second year and 2% for the third year. If a trigger extends the contract to four years, teachers will get a 3% pay increase. Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days, health insurance contribution rates would be frozen, and the ""enhanced pension program"" would be eliminated. Why they teach despite it all . As is, the median base salary for teachers in the Chicago public schools in 2011 was $67,974, according to the system's annual financial report. Chicago Public Schools CEO Jean-Claude Brizard said that the schools had improved measurably in the past year in test scores. The graduation rate was the highest and the dropout rate was the lowest in history. ""With this agreement now we have the foundation for transformation,"" he said. For high school athletes, strike could put scholarships on the line . CNN's Kyung Lah reported from Chicago and Greg Botelho from Atlanta.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- African regional authorities are prepared to remove from office self-proclaimed President Laurent Gbagbo, who election observers say lost last November's presidential runoff but has refused to step down, Ivory Coast's President-elect Alassane Ouattara said Thursday. ""I think it's clear that Mr. Laurent Gbagbo does not want to leave office,"" Ouattara told CNN, noting that representatives of the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union had tried to persuade him to leave earlier this week. ""If he decides to leave, fine. If he decides not to leave, I think ECOWAS, our subregional union, will take the appropriate steps to remove him -- either through specific measures which the military people are working on, or a military force, which will be put into place. ""And I don't think a military intervention would be a big problem because this has been used in other cases in Africa and in Latin America. It's not a war against Cote D'Ivoire,"" he said, using the French name for Ivory Coast. But Ouattara said he doesn't think such military intervention will lead to civil war. ""It's just a single person refusing to abide by the rules of democracy and creating problems for peace. So he will be removed. This shouldn't be a difficult operation."" The cocoa-producing West African nation was plunged into crisis when Ouattara was declared the winner of the November presidential runoff election, but Gbagbo, the incumbent, refused to leave office. The U.S. Treasury froze Gbagbo's assets in the United States on Thursday, and barred Americans from doing business with him. His wife and three top aides also were sanctioned. ""Laurent Gbagbo continues to demonstrate wanton disregard for the will and well-being of the people of Cote d'Ivoire,"" the director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said. ""Today's designations will isolate him and his inner circle from the world's financial system and underscore the desire of the international community that he step down,"" Adam J. Szubin added. Ouattara told CNN Thursday that he welcomes a proposal for direct negotiations with Gbagbo -- on the condition that Gbagbo recognize Ouattara as president. Ouattara remains holed up in a waterfront hotel under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. Gbagbo had previously promised to remove a military blockade he placed around the Golf Hotel, but those troops were still there late Thursday. The foreign minister under Gbagbo's government, Alcide Djedje, told reporters Thursday that the troops were there to counter the threat posed by Ouattara's security force. ""More than 300 heavily armed soldiers live there, which constitutes a menace,"" he said. They must depart before Gbagbo's contingent of soldiers will depart, he said. ""It's there for security purposes,"" he said. Ouattara acknowledged that some military were with him, but put the number at fewer than 300. He said they were the security guards assigned to him from when he served as prime minister. The United Nations said Wednesday it would ask the Security Council to approve up to 2,000 more troops to help ensure Ouattara is able to move out of the hotel and into the presidential palace. But Djedje said the peacekeepers are ""complicit with the rebellion; we cannot accept that."" He added, ""Right now, we have no more confidence in the U.N."" Alain Le Roy, the under-secretary-general for U.N. peacekeeping, said after a Security Council briefing that he was worried ""we are facing more difficulties"" in Ivory Coast. As the political standoff continued, the top U.S. diplomat on Africa said Gbagbo had ""stolen"" the vote that removed him from office. ""There is no question but that the election in the Ivory Coast was stolen by President Gbagbo and those around him,"" Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson told reporters Wednesday. Gbagbo's ""continued presence in office amounts to a theft of the election,"" Carson said. The United States and other countries have offered Gbagbo what they call a ""dignified exit,"" which could mean living and working in other countries, including the United States. Gbagbo, however, has ignored those offers and has refused to accept telephone calls from U.S. officials. Carson said Gbagbo has challenged democracy not only in Ivory Coast but also in the region. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the African Union envoy for the mediation effort who met earlier this week with Gbagbo, said the embattled leader was open to a meeting with Ouattara. ""He (Gbagbo) does not want any conditions,"" Odinga said. ""He wants amnesty. He wants to know he's safe if he chooses to stay. These are things that have to be discussed face to face. ""But Ouattara is not willing to negotiate unless Gbagbo accepts that he's president,"" Odinga said. ""Ouattara is being difficult."" Ouattara has said he will ensure protection for Gbagbo if he concedes, Odinga said. Violence following Gbagbo's refusal to vacate office has left more than 170 people dead in Ivory Coast and disrupted life for residents in Abidjan, the country's commercial hub.

"(CNN) -- Olympic snowboarding medalist Shaun White apologized Tuesday, a day after his arrest on vandalism and public intoxication charges at a hotel in Nashville. White, 26, was arrested after trying to flee the hotel in a cab and kicking a hotel guest who tried to stop him, according to a statement Monday from the Nashville Metro Police Department. The U.S. snowboarder, nicknamed ""The Flying Tomato"" for his distinctive red hair, posted an apology on his Facebook page Tuesday. ""I want to apologize for the unwise choices I made over the weekend and for any inconvenience it caused my family, friends, business partners, the hotel and their guests,"" White wrote. ""I was celebrating a happy occasion with a ton of family and friends and got carried away. I'm truly sorry for my poor behavior."" White ""appeared to be extremely intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol,"" and his ""eyes were red and bloodshot,"" according to the police report. White ran from the hotel after an employee accused him of smashing a phone, police said. A guest followed White from the hotel and called police, the incident report said. ""Once the guest told Mr. White that he called the police, Mr. White attempted to attack the man and fell and hit his head,"" the report said. White was taken to a hospital to have his head injury checked, police said. The guest didn't press charges, but White was arrested on the other misdemeanor charges after refusing to sign a citation, police said. White was released on his own recognizance Monday evening, Davidson County sheriff's spokeswoman Melinda McDowell said. White has been a professional snowboarder and skateboarder since his early teens, taking gold medals in the halfpipe competition at the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics.

"Los Angeles, California  (CNN) -- The FBI and University of California at Los Angeles police are investigating a new round of threats from anti-animal research activists who claimed to have sent AIDS-tainted razor blades and a threatening message to a research professor, a university spokesman said Tuesday. The university said law enforcement officials confirmed that UCLA neuroscientist David Jentsch received a package at his home containing razor blades and a threatening note. The North American Animal Liberation Press Office posted an unsigned communique on its website from a group calling itself ""The Justice Department at UCLA,"" claiming its members sent the razor blades to Jentsch because he uses primates for government-funded testing of drug addiction. ""He has no business addicting primates to phencyclidine known on the streets as PCP and other street drugs using grant money from the federal government,"" said the statement issued Tuesday by the activist group. Since 2006, other anonymous activists claimed responsibility for at least 11 acts of sabotage, vandalism, criminal damage and firebombing against UCLA faculty or property, either on and off campus, university officials said. In March 2009, activists seeking to stop the use of animals in research claimed to set fire to Jentsch's vehicle parked overnight outside his home. Jentsch, a professor of psychology, psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences, uses vervet monkeys in his research into the biochemical processes that contribute to methamphetamine addiction and tobacco dependence in teenagers, and the cognitive disabilities affecting schizophrenia patients, according to the university. Much of Jentsch's work is funded by the National Institutes of Health, university officials said. ""Responsible use of animals in research aimed at improving the health and welfare of the mentally ill is the right thing to do, and we will continue because we have a moral responsibility to society to use our skills for the betterment of the world,"" Jentsch said in a statement. In a phone interview with CNN, Jentsch said the activists have been ""using various tactics to get at me."" ""They started with incinerating my car,"" he said. ""They have participated in monthly demonstrations outside of my house. Usually the threats are general, this one was very specific. ""They said they were going to cut my throat, and they named one of my students. ""I'm not afraid. I'm angry. It's so ridiculous in our society that people do this just because they don't like what you do,"" he added. Jentsch provided an account of the threat. ""About a week ago I was going through my mail in my kitchen and I opened a letter and razor blades spilled out on the floor. It was the first sign something was nefarious,"" he said. ""The letter inside contained quite specific and heinous acts of violence to kill me."" He said the letter was signed by the Justice Department, which he described as a group ""loosely aligned with the Animal Liberation Front."" ""The major reason [no one has been arrested] is because the Animal Liberation Front has no official membership. Their spokesman calls from underground and claims to not know any of its members,"" Jentsch said. Jerry Vlasak, an animal rights activist, said he does not know who targeted Jentsch but he says he understands why the researcher was targeted. ""He does not have the right to go home to feel at ease. Try to look at it from the perspective of the innocent beings that he is doing this to,"" Vlasak said. Vlasak says he is a medical doctor who also used to do animal research but stopped because he felt it was incredibly torturous to animals. ""He has refused to debate with me and other doctors. He has spoken out against animal activists. So he has basically made himself an even bigger target, by saying not only am I going to continue torturing animals but I am flipping the bird to all these animal rights activist that want to stop me,"" Vlasak said. University spokesman Phil Hampton condemned the threats. ""What's happened here recently is only the recent manifestation of a pattern of reprehensible, repugnant criminal activity directed at UCLA researchers,"" Hampton said. ""UCLA is committed to conducting research that helps us to understand better the human body and is making important steps and strides to new diagnoses, treatments and cures to a wide variety of ailments such as Parkinson's (disease) and cancer.""

"(CNN) -- A British cruise ship avoided a possible pirate attack in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday when the captain to took evasive maneuvers and alerted naval authorities after the ship's radar detected an approaching small boat. The 350-passenger Spirit of Adventure was traveling some 100 miles off the coast of the east African country of Tanzania -- embarking on a two-week trip from Mauritius to Mombasa, Kenya -- when the boat sped toward the ship, said cruise liner spokesman Paul Green. ""As a precautionary measure (the captain) asked the passengers to go to the main lounge,"" Green said. The passengers stayed in the lounge area for approximately 45 minutes while the captain steered the ship to avoid the approaching boat, which at one point came within a few hundred meters, he said. No shots were fired and no attempt to board was made, Green added. Sll cruises traveling in the Indian Ocean provide security briefings for passengers as a matter of policy, he said. Pirate attacks and subsequent ransoms have become a frequent hazard for those traveling off the east African coast, particularly Somalia, which has had no formal central government since 1991. At least 28 vessels and 654 hostages are currently being held by pirates off the Somali coast, according to a statement from the European Union Naval Force.","A cruise ship avoided a possible pirate attack in the Indian Ocean .

"(CNN) -- We grew up in project buildings. We grew up at the end of cul-de-sacs. We grew up five miles from the nearest house. We grew up in America. We come from backgrounds of luxury and struggle. We finished school with honors, and we dropped out. We voted for the first time, and we only just registered. We didn't understand red states or blue states. We understood that these are the United States. And as a generation, we millennials must be united in the fact that the collective power we possess will allow us to do great things for this country that we call our home. We must show this power en masse on Election Day, one vote by one vote. Millennials to candidates: Talk to us . We are bombarded with television analysis, newspaper opinions, blogs, tweets, Facebook posts, radio commentators and street corner preachers that all offer some perspective about who will decide the election between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Over the course of months, this commentary puts the power in the hands of various constituencies. Seniors in Florida. Independent women in New Hampshire. The unemployed in Ohio. Every day, some new group gets handed the magic wand that will choose the winner of this year's battle. Opinion: Why this election is so personal . But, let me be straight. The battle begins with millennials, those much-maligned 18-to 29-year olds for whom so much is at stake. For this is our future. The future arrived yesterday, and the present presents us with an opportunity to dream big. Dreams that in reality will uplift our entire generation, not just a percentage of us. Dreams that are so deeply rooted in compassion, that there is no way we leave anyone behind. The undecided millennial . Our dreams from last night become our marching orders as we awake to the understanding that this election will be decided by millions of young people, our people, in states across this country. In Durham, North Carolina, a young woman will cast her ballot for the first time. In Columbus, Ohio, a university student will be the first in his family to vote in a presidential election. In Tallahassee, Florida, a young couple will enter that voting both for the second time in their lives, this time not just voting for themselves but voting for their child. Both campaigns have simplified their efforts to focus on 10 swing states. They will spend millions of dollars over the next few weeks targeting those states, as well as undecided voters. But some of us are not included in that game plan. Some of us were left off the roll call. You know what means? 'Gen Xer' Ryan makes case to young voters . That means, like Muhammad Ali said, we have the chance to shake up the world. Show them who is the greatest. Not just of this time, but of all time. Show up in numbers that no one can believe. Early votes. Absentee ballots. Election Day decisions. However you have to pull that lever, pull it. For this is our future. It is our brothers and sisters who are the ones coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq, many of whom feel like we have let them down. It is our colleges that are becoming too expensive for us to attend, leaving us with monthly payments that empty our bank accounts. It is our compadres who are impacted by the DREAM Act and want only to live without fear in a country they, too, call their home. It is our Medicare and Social Security that might disappear before we even make it to the finish line. It is our boyfriends and girlfriends who just want to walk down the aisle and say two simple words: ""I do."" It is our planet that is being destroyed by big business and politicians with oily pockets lined with dirty coal. This is what is at stake. Not just an election to elect a president but an election to elect the destiny of our generation. Have the youth given up on Obama? So, let us promise to each other that we will not sit this one out. We will not watch this one pass us by. We will not move on to the next one. We will cast our ballots like our generation depended on it. For if we depend on one another, we will be united.

"(CNN) -- Two hostages were injured at a bank in Lima, Peru, before a police sniper killed a man who held 33 people there for seven hours, state media reported. Moments before shooting the hostage-taker Friday night, police SWAT teams helped four bank employees escape through a window, Interior Minister Miguel Hidalgo told the government's Andina news agency. ""This opening allowed us to get in position, use authorized weapons and end this drama,"" he said. The man threatened staff and clients at the downtown bank with a gun and an explosive strapped to his chest, the news agency reported. He demanded 2 million soles ($714,000) and a helicopter as a condition for their release. At least two hostages were wounded in the standoff, Hidalgo said -- one with a gunshot wound and another who was injured after being hit in the head with a revolver. Hidalgo praised the rescue operation, saying the gunman had been ""uncompromising"" and left police no choice but to shoot him. A bomb squad entered the bank after hostages had been evacuated to detonate the explosive the gunman had used to threatened the hostages, Andina reported. The bank is located in Gamarra, Lima's textile and garment district, a poor part of the city with a high crime rate. Journalist Naomi Mapstone contributed to this report.","Police say the gunman demanded money and threatened hostages .

"Baku, Azerbaijan (CNN) -- ""Oil Rocks"" is a piece of history. Azerbaijan's ""city in the sea"" is the site of the world's first offshore oil well. One hundred and twenty kilometers out into the Caspian Sea, it's still actually within the capital Baku's city limits. Built in 1949, in Soviet times, Oil Rocks is a huge feat of human engineering. Three hundred kilometers of roads, 256 individual oil wells: this is no small operation. Two thousand people live and work here every day, working on a one-week shift rotation. Catering to the needs of its citizens, it even has its own museum and restaurants. Oil Rocks was the world's first attempt to tap into offshore reserves, buried beneath the water. Stalin commissioned the project, before going on to develop Russia's Siberian oil operations. One drilling platform after another was built and linked up with piers, the foundations formed by sinking ships 1,000 meters to the seabed. Flying there by helicopter, a thin film of oil over the water is visible -- evidence of the biggest industry in the Caspian Sea region: hydrocarbons. Local oil and gas reserves have been exploited over the years by the Persians, the Ottomans, the Soviets and now Azerbaijan itself. In Azerbaijan the oil has been flowing for centuries. In 1900, half of the world's production of crude oil came from this corner of the former Soviet Union. This country is now a transit point for energy exports from the whole Caspian Sea region. Oil Rocks is a fascinating link in the chain of eastern supply and western demand. Today the site is operated by SOCAR, Azerbaijan's state oil company. A new well was drilled just this month. Over 60 years after it was built and Oil Rocks is still producing oil and gas, still contributing to the Azeri economy.","Built in 1949, Azerbaijan's 'Oil Rocks' was the world's first offshore oil well .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to versatility, New Orleans musician Aaron Neville knows the ropes. He's tackled pop, soul, gospel and R&B over his five-decade long career. Now, he's venturing into the genre of one of his biggest inspirations: doo-wop. His new album, titled ""My True Story,"" features 12 songs, which are all doo-wop covers. He handpicked all of the covers -- from ""Under the Boardwalk"" by the Drifters to ""Ting a Ling"" by the Clovers. Because he loves doo-wop so much, he said there may even more songs to come: ""We had 12 songs and we ended up doing 23. So there will probably be a part two and a part three,"" Neville told CNN. Neville said the inspiration for the album comes from childhood memories of his hometown and his family. His older brother Art introduced him to doo-wop. ""He was a singer,"" Neville said. ""He had this doo-wop group ... and I got to play with them and go up and down Louisiana and Mississippi."" Neville and his brothers Art, Charles and Cyril would later form The Neville Brothers and churn out more than a dozen albums on various labels. Over the years, they've all been involved in their own musical projects, but still perform together at various festivals. Many fans have dubbed them New Orleans' ""first family of funk"". Neville said the Crescent City will always be home. ""I just did a gig at the House of Blues (in New Orleans) and it was so noisy,"" Neville said. ""It's the best feeling in the world to hear that."" He provided a lot of comfort to fans from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. He met displaced New Orleanians all over the country as he toured, and many of them were grateful to be reminded of home. ""It felt good that we would give, that we could make somebody feel good, because I know I was feeling -- and I'm sure they were feeling the same way -- your whole everything just was gone."" Even though Neville often returns to his hometown to perform, he has not returned to his home in East New Orleans since Katrina. Much of that area was decimated by the storm and flood waters. He and his family evacuated to Memphis, and the singer eventually made his way to New York, which has become his new home. New York is also where he recorded ""My True Story,"" which was a project that included several musical heavyweights. The album was produced by EMI Music's President Don Was and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. Richards and Neville first met back in 1981 while on tour. ""We've been running across each other for years. We have much respect for each other,"" Neville said. ""I think Keith is one of the most down-to-Earth guys in the world."" And Neville still has some other artists he'd like to work with, he said. ""I'd like to work with Steve Wonder, Smokey (Robinson), Natalie Cole. And I heard Beyonce -- she was imitating me on 'Don't Know Much' and I think she can sing."" Besides collaborations, Neville may be diving into yet another genre soon. ""I've never really done a blues album, and I can sing blues,"" he said. That's the good thing about my band. We can do every genre of music."" ""My True Story"" is set to be released on January 22.","Aaron Neville will release a doo-wop cover album .

"(CNN) -- Benilda Caixeta, who was paralyzed from her shoulders down, was one of many residents of New Orleans, Louisiana, still trying to evacuate when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29, 2005. But despite her repeated calls to the local transportation system that served people with disabilities, as well as to 911, help never arrived. She was found dead in her apartment several days later, floating next to her wheelchair. Monday marks the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. As we celebrate this historic law, which delivered civil rights to millions of Americans, we must also acknowledge how far we still have to go to live up to the law's promise -- especially when it comes to planning for disasters and protecting the vulnerable such as Benilda Caixeta. For years, our nation's emergency management community simply has not done a good enough job planning for and meeting the needs of people with disabilities. When Katrina hit in 2005, more than 54 million Americans, or almost 20 percent of our population, had disabilities. During that hurricane season, communities with large disabled populations were struck hard. Their experiences are some of the lesser known -- but equally important -- lessons that should have been learned from those storms. Yet we saw many of those same mistakes repeated two years later during Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Many children and adults with disabilities were turned away from shelters. Blind and deaf residents did not have access to critical information about where to go or how to get assistance. Services that are required under ADA and other disability rights laws were not provided. And many disabled evacuees developed serious -- but preventable -- health complications. Last month, these issues were again highlighted by lawmakers during a congressional hearing at which questions were raised about whether enough funds are being committed to ensure the safety of people with disabilities. It is our responsibility to meet these challenges, and that requires understanding their cause. The root of the problem lies here: Historically the U.S. emergency management field has treated people with disabilities as a separate population, rather than as part of the larger community. This limited approach not only directly violates the intent of the ADA, but ties up personnel and resources when a disaster strikes. It jeopardizes everyone's safety. As the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and former head of the Florida Department of Emergency Management, I know from experience that we can't afford to wait to plan for people with disabilities until after we plan for the rest of the community. That's why one of my top priorities in my first year at FEMA has been to transform the way the emergency management community thinks about integrating this vital population. From day one, we have challenged every member of our leadership team to start integrating the needs of people with disabilities into every step of planning. In February, we established the Office of Disability Integration and Coordination, the first office in FEMA's history dedicated to ensuring that the needs of people with disabilities are factored into all operations. As a result, we are already taking important steps to better support all members of our emergency management team -- state and local officials, nonprofit organizations, volunteer groups and the private sector -- in helping people with disabilities before, during and after a disaster. We are working with disability advocates to incorporate the needs of people with disabilities into emergency communications and public alert systems, evacuations, transportation and medical equipment supply plans. Preplanning for evacuations, for example, must include accessible transportation for people using wheelchairs and information that is easy to act on for people who are deaf or blind, or people who have cognitive or intellectual disabilities. We are improving our disaster housing strategies to ensure that people with disabilities have access to general shelters and temporary housing that meet their needs and to ease their transitions back into the community. Shelters must be able to keep families intact during an emergency, instead of turning away members of a family because of a disability. We have already seen some of these strategies start to make a difference. Just last month, during the evacuations for Hurricane Alex, Baptist Child and Family Services, which provides shelters for the state of Texas, followed our guidelines for serving evacuees with and without disabilities in their community shelters. These guidelines included providing practical cot and sleeping arrangements for evacuees with disabilities, helping them with personal care, hygiene and special dietary needs, and accommodating service animals in the shelter, among other things. And because our primary mission is always to support state and local officials when responding to a disaster, we are coordinating disability-focused training within FEMA and with our federal partners across the Obama administration and private organizations. This is just the beginning of an effort that will be challenging and take a lot of hard work. This anniversary is an opportunity to reflect on how far our nation has come since the Americans with Disabilities Act was first signed into law -- and to take an honest look at where we go from here. At FEMA, that means continuing to learn from the mistakes of the past to better protect and serve the entire community. It's not only the law -- it's the right thing to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Craig Fugate.","Those with disabilities are especially at risk in disasters, says FEMA's Craig Fugate .

"Tirana, Albania (CNN) -- At least three protesters were shot dead from close range in a clash with police Friday outside the Albanian prime minster's office, a hospital official said, an escalation of some of the worst politically fueled tension to wrack the southern European nation in 14 years. The face-off also left 23 demonstrators hurt, including three in critical condition with head injuries at Tirana Military Hospital, according to its emergency unit chief, Sami Koceku. He said that at least 17 police officers also injured in the confrontations were at that hospital, one of the city's main medical facilities. A report from state-run network TVSH had a slightly higher injury toll from hospitals throughout Tirana, Albania's capital and most populated city. It put the count at 35 demonstrators and 27 police. The opposition Socialist Party claimed, on its website, that around 250,000 people gathered outside Prime Minister Sali Berisha's office to implore him to resign amid allegations of corruption and fraud related to the June 2009 election. Some of the protesters threw stones and Molotov cocktails at some of the more than 1,000 police who were at the scene, ostensibly to provide security. Authorities responded by using water cannons in an attempt to disperse the crowds. Afterwards, Albania's current president, Bamir Topi, issued a statement urging all political parties to resume talks soon and not to reopen old wounds -- referring to a 1997 at-times violent crisis that also targeted Berisha, who was then the nation's president. Topi urged ""calm and self-restraint"" by all Albanians, as well as support for the police and governmental institutions. The U.S. Embassy in Tirana issued a like-minded statement on Friday, expressing ""deep regret that (the protest) was not peaceful"" and calling on all sides ""to abstain from provocations."" Rather, the embassy pushed for ""constructive dialogue and compromise to resolve the existing political differences."" And the European Union, which has been considering adding Albania as a member, also ""urgently"" appealed to ""all political forces ... to engage in a constructive (dialogue) and to mobilize the countries' energies"" to resolve the political stalemate. ""Demonstrators are instruments of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly for citizens,"" said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Stefan Fule, commissioner for enlargement and the European neighborhood policy, in a statement. ""We deplore that today's event has spiralled into violence."" Yet key players in Friday's incident, and in the long-brewing political friction in Albania, showed no signs of backing down Friday. Berisha directly blamed the casualties on his chief political rival, Socialist Party leader Edi Rama, whom he accused of scheming to have demonstrators take over the prime minister's office, parliament and key ministries, state-run ATA news agency reported. Rama ""will take full responsibility,"" Berisha told reporters, adding that Friday's actions ""will not be accepted, but punished."" For his part, Rama -- who is also the mayor of Tirana -- accused government forces of going overboard, and blamed police for provoking protesters by using the water tanks and tear gas. Earlier this month, in an interview quoted in a Socialist Party newsletter, Rama reiterated long-standing claims that Berisha's ruling Democratic Party had rigged the most recent election. ""Are there any Albanians who have not yet understood that (Berisha) stole the elections in order to rob Albania?"" he said. ""That was clear to us from the very beginning, but by now it has become clear to every reasonable Albanian."" The country's supreme court determined that the elections were orderly, and the ballots were burned by the Central Election Commission. The Socialist Party boycotted Albania's parliament between September 2009 and February 2010, according to the U.S. State Department. Efforts since then to resolve the long political stalemate have been unsuccessful, with opposition parties continuing to push hard against the Democrats in alleging corruption. On Friday, Berisha guaranteed that there would ""be no early elections"" and that ""general elections will be held in 2013,"" a rebuttal to the timeline being pushed by the opposition. The tensions escalated in the past two weeks, after a former government minister sent the media a secret recording that allegedly documented an illicit back-room deal. In the video, then-Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta asked Dritan Prifti, who at that point was Albania's economic minister, to arrange for irregular contracts and have the government hire hacks who belonged to his small party, the Socialist Movement for Integration. Meta later replaced Prifti, a member of that same party, as economic minister. He resigned from that position last week, even as he claimed that the tape featuring him and Prifti had been manipulated with bits edited in and out, out of context. Still, the opposition largely has focused its wrath on Berisha. This is not his first time under fire: In 1997, for instance, angry mobs protested against Berisha -- then the nation's president -- after voting irregularities and costly Ponzi schemes plunged Albania into near-anarchy and led to snap elections. The animosity, and harsh rhetoric, have heightened in recent weeks. In addition to increasingly pointed, accusatory barbs between Rama and Berisha, personal slurs marred a parliamentary session this week meant to settle governmental changes following Meta's resignation.","NEW: The EU, which has considered adding Albania, urges ""calm"" and ""dialogue""

"(CNN) -- The crew of a U.S.-flagged cargo ship, held more than a week and accused of arms trafficking, is expected to set sail Monday or Tuesday from Venezuela after authorities dropped charges against them. ""While we haven't left yet, it looks like a positive solution has been reached,"" a crew member, who asked to remain anonymous because of security concerns, said in an e-mail to CNN on Sunday night. He said the charges were dropped for the captain and the 14 crew members. A U.S. State Department official confirmed Sunday the charges were dropped, but Venezuela's Ministry of Communications told CNN they had no information regarding the case. The Ocean Atlas docked at the port of Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, on August 29, according to the crew member. A few days later, the crew was told the ship was under investigation for arms trafficking, and last Wednesday, the captain and crew were charged. The captain, Jeffrey Raider of Texas, was taken into custody and made a court appearance. He came back to the ship once, to move the ship from the docks to anchor in Maracaibo Bay, but he was held on land while the crew members were told to stay on the ship, the crew member said. After the charges were dropped Sunday, the crew member said the captain was finally able to return to the ship. The crew member who spoke to CNN said there were ""normal shipboard conditions"" while the ship has been detained and that there was never any danger or threat of physical harm. Though the Venezuelan authorities who boarded the ship were armed, he said, ""at all times the guns were pointed at the ground."" He thanked the Seafarer's International Union for their help with the case and Crowley Maritime, the ship's manager, for constantly updating the families of the crew. The Ocean Atlas, built in 2000, is a 393-foot long, heavy-lift cargo ship with two cranes, according to its operator, Intermarine. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said last week the detention had to do with customs paperwork for rifles that were on board for the crew's protection. ""We, of course, know that the high seas and that piracy have been a major topic in recent months and years, and so that's something we've been combating,"" Ventrell told reporters. ""It's normal for many ships to have some type of self-defense on board."" The crew member in touch with CNN said the ship's security team keeps the rifles in a locker on board. He said the captain declared the weapons on arrival in Maracaibo and was cleared to have them, but the Venezuelan authorities denied there was permission for the weapons and confiscated them.

"(CNN) -- The popular protests in Tunisia that have caused upheaval in the government were sparked by Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate, who set himself on fire in protest. He later died. Now, reports are coming in from other countries in the region -- Egypt, Algeria, and Mauritania -- that other demonstrators are turning to self-immolation. In Egypt, Abdo Abelmonem Gafr, a baker from a town outside Cairo, set himself on fire outside the parliament building in the capital on Monday, an Interior Ministry official said. Gafr has burns to his face but is alive and not badly hurt, ministry spokesman Alla Mahmood said. A police officer put the fire out. Gafr's motives and his age were not immediately known. In Algeria, security officials said Sunday that three people set themselves on fire in protest. Riots and demonstrations have erupted in Algeria in recent days. Much like in Tunisia, Algerians are frustrated over the economy, rising food prices and what they feel is a government that's not responding to their needs. New Tunisian government could be announced Monday . News reports out of Mauritania say a man set himself on fire Monday in front of the presidential palace. Reports identify the man as Yacoub Dahoud, who posted a Facebook message praising Bouazizi and vowing, ""We will never forget you."" Mauritanian media said Dahoud started a Facebook group called ""Stop the corruption and tyranny in Mauritania."" In a statement on the page, Dahoud wrote, ""Isn't it the time for the Mauritanian people to choose their freedom?"" ""The Arab world's horrific new trend: self-immolation,"" wrote Blake Hounshell of the foreignpolicy.com blog on Monday. ""There is something horrifying and, in a way, moving about these suicide attempts. It's a shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy,"" Hounshell, Foreign Policy's managing editor, wrote. Throughout the Tunisia protests, experts have been saying similar demonstrations could spread to other nations in the region. Bouazizi, the man who triggered the Tunisia protests, had set himself ablaze outside a government building in the town of Sidi Bouzid after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. In a country with a long-time president and a young, underemployed population, the incident became a symbol for millions. Other Arab nations face similar conditions -- large populations of young people, anger over the economy, and a government that many feel fails to represent them. A 2008 study by doctors in Iran, titled ""Self-immolation in Iran"" and published in the Journal of Burn Care and Research, says, ""Deliberate self-inflicted burn is rare in high-income countries, but is reported more frequently in low- and middle-income countries, especially in Asia and Africa."" The study, which has an abstract on PubMed.gov, adds, ""Unemployment was a risk factor for self-immolation, while mental disorders and lack of access to health and treatment facilities did not play an important role for increasing the rate of self-immolation."" Buddhist monks famously took to self-immolation in protest against the Vietnam War. ""Of all the dramatic photographs to come out of the Vietnam War, the first to shock the world was of a Buddhist monk in flames,"" journalist Tim Larimer wrote for Time magazine in 1999. At Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 2001, five people lit themselves on fire in front of a CNN crew. One died. A police report identified them as members of the banned Falun Gong movement. But Falun Gong denied any connection to that incident, saying what transpired had ""nothing to do with Falun Gong practitioners."" It is too soon to know whether the reports coming in of self-immolations are connected, and whether those lighting themselves on fire are hoping to spark protests in their countries. But as the events in Tunisia show, leaders of other nations in the region who face anger from a young, frustrated, underemployed population have reason to be on guard. -CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: Mauritanian media say man praised Bouazizi on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Portuguese voters handily re-elected President Anibal Cavaco Silva to another five-year term on Sunday, as the incumbent beat six other contenders to avoid a runoff election. Silva got 53% of the vote -- getting support from an all-important majority, making another election unnecessary -- according to state-run media outlets RTP and LUSA. He far outpaced his nearest competitor, Manuel Alegre, who was chosen on just under 20% of ballots. Roughly 53% of Portugal's registered voters weighed in Sunday, despite inclement weather in parts of the southwestern European nation. Silva has been president since March 9, 2006, when he won his first five-year term by besting four other contenders -- one of them being Mario Soares, who had served two terms as prime minister and one as president. He will continue to team with Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who was first elected in 2005 and backed by voters for another term four years later. Together, they, government ministers and lawmakers face the daunting task of steering Portugal through a severe, prolonged economic crisis. Like Greece and Ireland, there have been mounting concerns that Portugal will need a bailout from fellow European Union members and the International Monetary Fund because, due to its poor credit, it might not be able to pay for government operations through the usual borrowing measures.","Voters re-elect President Anibal Cavaco Silva to another five-year term .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- The preliminary results of a referendum on an independent Southern Sudan will be announced in the next few days, with final results as early as February 7, the national commission that organized the vote said Tuesday, . The South Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC), which was formed last year by President Omar al-Bashir, said the preliminary results will be announced Saturday in Juba in Southern Sudan and on February 2 in Khartoum, Sudan's capital. ""If there is no appeal, the final results will be announced on February 7,"" said Justice Chan Reec Madut, deputy chairman of the commission. ""But if there is an appeal or appeals, they have to be discussed, and the final announcement will then be on February 14."" South Sudanese voted in a weeklong referendum in early January on whether to form an independent state. Preliminary results show 99% voted for independence with most of the count in the south completed. The commission faced three challenges during the referendum process: the legal aspect of the referendum itself, time and finances, according to commission chairman Muhammad Khalil. ""In these kinds of situations, where there are political negotiations, there is a lot of give and take,"" Khalil said, ""and this reflected on the law."" ""The law itself was framed in an unclear way with much repetition. ... It was shaky,"" he said. Nevertheless, Khalil said, the referendum commission, which includes southern Sudanese and northern Sudanese members, worked easily together, ""making decisions in accord."" Khalil said the commission did not have much time to conduct its work. ""It was conceived by those who signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that the referendum process would take 42 months,"" he said. ""By the time the referendum commission was established, we had four months."" The referendum on whether to declare independence from the government based in the north is part of a 2005 peace agreement that helped end a two-decade-long war. The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians or animists in the south. The conflict left about 2 million people dead. Funding was also a challenge for the referendum, Khalil said. ""The international funding was generous but not made available for Sudanese expertise,"" he said. ""If we had more funding, we would have included more Sudanese experts to give the referendum an added national face."" Both the federal government of Sudan and the government of south Sudan had committed themselves to funding the referendum with 400 million Sudanese pounds (about $160 million), Khalil said, but the commission only received 26.6 million SDG in the north, and 60 million SDG in the south. Madut also pointed to ""logistical difficulties"" in the south during the referendum. ""We used human porters who delivered material on their heads to transport the materials and kits to the counties."" However, Madut said, the high turnout was historical. ""It is something that has never happened in Sudan; in fact some say it never happened anywhere."" Madut said once the counting is done, the rest will be up to the politicians. Issues such as borders, the future of the oil-rich border district of Abyei, citizenship rights and how to manage international debts are yet to be resolved. ""We were able to finish in five months what was supposed to be done in three years,"" he said. ""So unless we are told to come back ... we we would like to take a beautiful vacation.""","The South Sudan Referendum Commission was formed last year .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- At least five people were killed Tuesday in clashes between police and supporters of Ivory Coast's president-elect as a tense political standoff continued Tuesday in the West African nation. The governor of Abidjan said three police officers and two demonstrators were killed. The violence comes a day after the U.N. Security Council deplored the violence in the country since the November 28 election and ""urged all parties to exercise restraint."" The cocoa-producing West African nation was plunged into crisis when Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the presidential runoff election, but incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refused to leave office. The Security Council expressed its backing for the efforts by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States in pursuing a peaceful resolution of the crisis. At the same time, the council repeated its readiness ""to impose measures, including targeted sanctions against people ""who threaten the peace process,"" block the work of the U.N. mission and other international people there or ""commit serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law."" Meanwhile, Ouattara is willing to add supporters of self-proclaimed president Gbagbo to his Cabinet, provided the defiant incumbent steps down, the West African nation's ambassador to the United Nations said Monday. Ambassador Youssoufou Bamba said Ouattara would not enter a power-sharing government similar to that in Zimbabwe but that he would be open to a unity cabinet. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq could not confirm any such offer from the Ouattara government and said that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon still called for Gbagbo to step down in favor of an orderly transition. Ouattara told CNN last week that he welcomes a proposal for direct negotiations with Gbagbo -- on the condition that Gbagbo recognize Ouattara as president. But in a telephone interview on Tuesday, Gbagbo's government spokesman, Ahoua Don Melo, rejected the proposal, saying Ouattara ""should first go to the Constitutional Council to get recognized as the president before making any proposal."" An independent election commission declared Ouattara the winner of the runoff election in November, but the country's Constitutional Council then declared Gbagbo the winner. The U.S. Treasury froze Gbagbo's assets in the United States last week and barred Americans from doing business with him. His wife and three top aides also were sanctioned. Ouattara remains holed up in the Golf Hotel under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. The United Nations and an ever-increasing number of other nations have recognized Ouattara, a former prime minister, as the rightful winner. The United States and other countries have offered Gbagbo what they call a ""dignified exit,"" which could mean living and working in other countries, including the United States. Gbagbo, however, has ignored those offers and has refused to accept telephone calls from U.S. officials. Ouattara has said he will ensure protection for Gbagbo if he concedes, said Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the African Union envoy for a multinational mediation effort. The U.N. Security Council welcomed AU and ECOWAS' intention to send ""another joint high-level mission as soon as possible to continue discussions with the two parties."" It expressed deep concern over continued violence and human rights violations, including against U.N. peacekeepers, and ""condemned deliberate attempts to impede the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire from fulfilling its mandate,"" referring to the country by its French name. Security Council members also ""strongly condemned and demanded an immediate halt"" to media efforts to ""propagate false information to incite hatred and violence."" Council members also condemned the ongoing blockade around the Golf Hotel. Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency is building a refugee camp for Ivorians fleeing to neighboring Liberia. The camp will initially be capable of housing some 18,000 refugees. At present, there are about 25,000 Ivorian refugees in Liberia, with about 600 people arriving daily. ""Refugees continue to tell us that in most cases they are fleeing fear of violence rather than actual violence against them,"" said the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The UNHCR has sufficient relief supplies for about 30,000 people in Liberia and said it ""is ready to mobilize stocks from Ghana for an additional 30,000 people if the need arises.""

"(CNN) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Wednesday that those behind the deadly blast at Moscow's busiest airport were hoping, in part, to prevent him from attending the World Economic Forum. Speaking at the gathering of business and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland, Medvedev said, ""Those who committed the heinous act by aiming their blow against the citizens of various countries expected that their act would bring Russia to its knees, would force us to be defensive. They expected and hoped that the president of Russia would not come here to attend to this forum, among other things, of course. This is the criteria used to choose the time and place for committing that act of terrorism. ""But they miscalculated. Russia is aware of its place in the world, Russia is aware of its responsibilities to its citizens and will comply with them, and its responsibility to the world community. This is the reason why on this day I'm speaking from this rostrum."" The bombing Monday killed 35 people. Earlier Wednesday, Medvedev fired top airport security officials. He accused transport police of ""taking an absolutely passive position. At best, they are examining migrants, to check their registration and display their authority,"" in comments carried on Russian state TV. Among the people he dismissed was Andrei Alexeyev, the head of the Interior Ministry's transport administration for the Central Federal District, he announced in his televised remarks. ""If people don't understand how to work, we'll find other people,"" Medvedev said, according the RIA-Novosti news agency. Moscow is observing a day of mourning for the victims Wednesday, with flags flying at half staff. The government asked television stations to cancel entertainment programs as a mark of respect, RIA-Novosti said. ""We have to do all we can to influence, if not the ideology, then at least the social and economic roots of terrorism -- poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, parentlessness,"" Medvedev said in Davos. ""And we have to be sure that global development is stable, safe, and just and fair."" At the end of his speech, he announced that he was cutting short his previously planned stay in Davos to head back to Moscow. The blast occurred around 4:30 p.m. Monday at the entrance of Domodedovo Airport's international arrivals section. A day later, authorities were still trying to tally the exact number of people injured in the blast. RIA-Novosti said as many as 180 were hurt. The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said there were 110 wounded people still in hospitals. Medvedev blamed security violations. ""What happened at Domodedovo shows the airport lacked security,"" he said Tuesday. ""It's unbelievable that such a huge amount of explosives were brought into the terminal. Those officials responsible for security at Domodedovo must be punished for their decisions. This is a terror attack, a grief, a tragedy."" It is not yet clear what impact a recent decision to shake up the Russian Transport Police, which is charged with protecting train stations and airports, may have had on the security perimeter at the airport Monday. In August, Medvedev fired at least 12 generals in the Transport Police branch of the Ministry of Interior, as part of a broader reform of the Russian security services. Domodedovo is 22 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of Moscow and is the largest of Moscow's three airports, as well as the busiest in terms of passenger traffic. It was still not immediately clear who was responsible for Monday's blast. Previous terror attacks in Russia have been blamed on militants from the North Caucasus region. Over the past decade, bombers have hit trains and planes operating in and traveling out of Moscow at least four times, with a combined death toll of more than 100 victims. In 2004, two planes blew up nearly simultaneously after taking off from Domodedovo airport. That attack was linked to Chechen suicide bombers. An explosive device derailed an express train in November 2009, killing at least 26 people. Chechen rebels were blamed again. Medvedev has called on his government to do ""everything in order for the criminals who committed this crime to be established, found and brought to justice. And the nest where these bandits are hiding, whatever their name is, should be exterminated.""

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people are expected to march in Northern Ireland on Sunday to commemorate the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre of local people by British troops. Organizers expect it to be the last march of its kind, since the British government finally admitted last year that its troops, not the demonstrators, were to blame. ""The great lie has been laid bare. The truth has been brought home at last,"" the republican political party Sinn Fein said in a statement Sunday. Sinn Fein seeks for Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland, rather than the United Kingdom. In June, the British government released a damning report that reversed decades of official explanations for the 1972 killings. The paratroopers who killed 14 people had no reason to believe they were under threat from the victims, gave no warnings before firing and lied to the far-reaching official inquiry into the seminal event, the inquiry concluded. Its report was a comprehensive rejection of the British government's official account of the killings, which had stood for 38 years. ""Some members of our armed forces acted wrongly ... and for that, on behalf of the government -- indeed, on behalf of our country -- I am deeply sorry,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said after the release of the long-awaited report. Bloody Sunday took place in the single bloodiest year of a conflict that claimed about 3,000 lives over a three-decade period known locally as The Troubles. The killings strengthened the Provisional Irish Republican Army, increased Irish Catholic hostility towards the British army and ""exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed,"" its report found. Sinn Fein is closely associated with the PIRA, which laid down its arms as part of a 1998 peace agreement. British troops fired more than 100 rounds on Bloody Sunday, in violation of orders issued to every soldier serving in Northern Ireland at the time, the report found. There was some provocation by the IRA in Londonderry that day, but nothing that justified the shootings of civilians, the report found. Only one victim was associated with the IRA, and he was probably not posing a threat when he was fatally shot, the report found. Bloody Sunday has been considered by many as one of the greatest injustices of Northern Ireland's troubled history. Even the name of the city where it happened is disputed, with pro-Irish nationalists calling it Derry and pro-British unionists calling it Londonderry. Addressing the question of how high responsibility for the massacre should go, the report overwhelmingly placed it with the soldiers who were on the ground, along with their commander, Lt. Col. Derek Wilford, who decided to launch the incursion. The report said there is no evidence that either the British or Northern Irish governments ""intended, planned, or foresaw"" the events of that day, or that either government tolerated or encouraged the use of ""unjustified"" lethal force. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Phil Black and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Sunday marks the 39th anniversary of the massacre in Northern Ireland .

"(CNN) -- Peace talks to negotiate an end to Latin America's oldest insurgency will begin in October in Oslo, Norway, officials said Tuesday. Colombia's government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, have signed a framework for the talks, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said in a televised address Tuesday. The framework is a ""road map"" that aims to resolve a conflict that has seen previous negotiations backfire on the government. The outcome of these talks will ""fall on my shoulders, and no one else,"" Santos said. The Colombian government confirmed last month that ""exploratory"" talks had taken place between the rebels and the government. Santos' announcement revealed the outcome of those talks. The next stage will be formal peace talks, which will begin in Oslo and then move to Havana, Cuba. In a video statement recorded in Colombia's mountains and broadcast to reporters in Havana, the leftist guerrilla group's leader thanked the governments of Venezuela, Cuba and Norway for facilitating the agreement to begin peace talks. ""Another Colombia is possible, and between all of us, we can create it,"" said FARC leader Rodrigo Londono Echeverri, who is also known as Timoleon Jimenez or Timochenko. The talks, he said, ""are above all the triumph of the national clamor for peace and a political solution."" The FARC's six-person negotiation team did not take questions Tuesday, but said they would speak to reporters again on Thursday. ""For us it is perfectly clear that the key to peace does not lie in the pocket of the president, nor is it with the commander of the FARC. The true and only custodians of such a key are the people of this country,"" Londono said. Critics, including former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, say it is impossible to hold peace talks without a unilateral ceasefire by the guerrillas. Colombia has learned from its mistakes, Santos said, and military operations will continue against the FARC during the peace talks. One of the most famous failures of a previous government was the granting of a huge demilitarized zone for the guerrillas, which they abused by using it to strengthen themselves militarily and politically. This time around, Colombia will not cede one inch of territory, Santos said. Peace is possible because of Colombia's economic growth and engagement with the world, the president said. Millions of Colombians have been lifted from poverty and using violent means to make political gains is an idea that has met its end, he said. This, together with the military successes Colombia has scored against the FARC, make it a good time for negotiations, Santos said. ""We do not fight for the sake of fighting. We fight to achieve peace,"" he declared. The president said it will not be an open-ended peace process, and progress will be reviewed monthly. The FARC has complied with everything it has promised so far, Santos said, and if the group continues to negotiate with the same seriousness, the outlook for the talks is good. The FARC's leader Tuesday noted that past negotiations had failed, but said he was optimistic that this time would be different. ""The achievement of a just and democratic peace is worth facing the most difficult challenges,"" he said. Cuba's foreign ministry said it was happy to have played a role in facilitating talks. ""A process of dialogue committed to peace and the settlement of a historical conflict in Colombia has opened up, which Cuba supports, being aware of its importance for the Colombian people and its significance for Latin America and the Caribbean,"" the foreign ministry said. U.S. officials praised news of the talks. ""President Obama welcomes President Santos' deep commitment to working for peace and recognizes the courage and sacrifice of successive Colombian governments -- and most especially of the Colombian people -- in achieving this milestone,"" the White House said. ""The FARC should now take this opportunity to end its decades of terrorism and narcotics trafficking, and allow the Colombian people to continue building a democratic, prosperous, and just society.""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- In another major sign of growing ties between India and the United States, President Barack Obama on Monday backed a permanent seat for India in the U.N. Security Council. ""In the years ahead, I look forward to a reformed U.N. Security Council that includes India as a permanent member,"" he said in an address to the Indian parliament. The statement came as Obama made a wide-ranging address that envisioned closer economic and security ties between the United States and India, standing ""shoulder to shoulder"" with the world's largest democracy. In a swift reaction, Pakistan said it is discounting the possibility of such a development. The Foreign Ministry said that ""India's aspirations for recognition as a global power notwithstanding, there are reasons enough to discredit this proposed direction of the process of UNSC reforms."" It cites ""India's conduct in relations with its neighbors and its continued flagrant violations of Security Council resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir,"" a disputed region that the nuclear rivals have fought about. Ben Rhodes, a top White House aide, told reporters before the speech that the Obama administration wants to ""send as clear a statement as possible"" that the United States sees India as a ""rising player"" on the international stage. But Rhodes said the United States is ""not getting into"" details about the time frame in which the United States would like to see India get the permanent seat and whether it will push to get India veto power as well. Rhodes, a senior staffer on the National Security Council, said the president's endorsement ""speaks volumes"" about U.S. support for India and the administration will let the key details be ""hashed out"" by the United Nations itself. At present, there are five permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France. All have veto power. Actually getting India a permanent seat will not be easy. Obama administration officials acknowledged that they and previous administrations have supported Japan, Germany and Brazil at various times for permanent seats on the Security Council without any success so far. Before Monday's announcement was made, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh alluded to the deal during a joint news conference before Obama's speech to parliament in which he highlighted the close cooperation on major issues typically confronted by the United Nations. ""As states possessing nuclear weapons, we have today put forth a common vision of a world without nuclear weapons, and decided to lead global efforts for non-proliferation and universal and non-discriminatory global nuclear disarmament,"" Singh said. ""This is a historic and bold bilateral initiative. We have also decided to strengthen cooperation to tackle nuclear terrorism, and we welcome U.S. participation in the Global Center for Nuclear Energy Partnership, which will be set up in India."" Pakistan, noting that reform is a ""difficult process and will take significant time,"" said it hopes that the United States ""will take a moral view and not base itself on any temporary expediency or exigencies of power politics."" ""Pakistan believes that U.S endorsement of India's bid for its permanent seat in the Security Council adds to the complexity of the process of reforms of the Council,"" the Foreign Ministry's written statement said. ""Pakistan's position on U.N. Security Council's reforms is based on principles. Any reform of the Council that contradicts the very fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter -- including the principle of sovereign equality; of equal rights and self-determination; and the principle of collective security -- would gravely undermine the system of international relations based on the U.N. Charter principles."" Obama, who mourned the deaths of American citizens in the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai and the killings of Indian citizens in the September, 11, 2001, strikes in the United States, said the shared bond is prompting both countries to work together to fight terrorism. He addressed the conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan in his speech. ""America's fight against al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates is why we persevere in Afghanistan, where major development assistance from India has improved the lives of the Afghan people."" He said the United States is working with Pakistan to address the threat of terror networks, such as those in Pakistan that were responsible for the Mumbai attacks, and it welcomes ""dialogue"" between the governments in New Delhi and Islamabad. ""The Pakistani government increasingly recognizes that these networks are not just a threat outside of Pakistan -- they are a threat to the Pakistani people, who have suffered greatly at the hands of violent extremists,"" said Obama. ""And we will continue to insist to Pakistan's leaders that terrorist safe-havens within their borders are unacceptable, and that the terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks be brought to justice. We must also recognize that all of us have an interest in both an Afghanistan and a Pakistan that is stable, prosperous and democratic -- and India has an interest in that as well."" Obama said India and the United States ""are now ready to begin implementing our civil nuclear agreement,"" a measure he called a ""landmark"" deal. At the same time, he talked about the importance of reducing the spread of nuclear weapons. ""The United States and India can pursue our goal of securing the world's vulnerable nuclear material. We can make it clear that even as every nation has the right to peaceful nuclear energy, every nation must also meet its international obligations -- and that includes the Islamic Republic of Iran."" Obama also said Monday that ""the world cannot remain silent"" as ""peaceful democratic movements are suppressed,"" citing the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma. ""For it is unacceptable to gun down peaceful protesters and incarcerate political prisoners decade after decade. It is unacceptable to hold the aspirations of an entire people hostage to the greed and paranoia of a bankrupt regime. It is unacceptable to steal an election, as the regime in Burma has done again for all the world to see,"" he said. He said India shouldn't avoid condemning human rights violations. ""If I can be frank, in international fora, India has often shied away from some of these issues. But speaking up for those who cannot do so for themselves is not interfering in the affairs of other countries. It's not violating the rights of sovereign nations. It's staying true to our democratic principles. "" Obama hailed Mahatma Gandhi, who used peaceful non-violence to help India gain its independence, and he noted Gandhi's influence on Martin Luther King and the non-violent resistance that typified the American civil rights movement. ""I am mindful that I might not be standing before you today, as president of the United States, had it not been for Gandhi and the message he shared and inspired with America and the world,"" the president said. Obama lauded India's rise on the world stage, saying that ""for Asia and around the world, India is not simply emerging; India has already emerged"" and he said the country is unleashing an ""economic marvel."" He envisions, he said, U.S.-Indian relations as ""one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century."" He said India has overcome critics who say the country was too poor, vast and diverse to succeed, citing its Green Revolution and investments in science and technology. ""The world sees the results, from the supercomputers you build to the Indian flag that you put on the moon."" Obama praised India's democratic institutions: its free electoral system, independent judiciary, the rule of law, and free press. He said India and the United States have a unique link because they are democracies and free-market economies. ""When Indians vote, the whole world watches. Thousands of political parties. Hundreds of thousands of polling centers. Millions of candidates and poll workers, and 700 million voters. There's nothing like it on the planet. There is so much that countries transitioning to democracy could learn from India's experience; so much expertise that India can share with the world. That, too, is what's possible when the world's largest democracy embraces its role as a global leader,"" he said. Noting the country's rise as a world power, Obama said he sees the United States cooperating with India in various international and regional alliances. He praised India's role in the climate change negotiations and its role as a top contributor in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Obama talked about the two countries pursuing joint research efforts, such as starting green jobs. He talked about reducing barriers to foreign investments, helping India improve weather forecasting before monsoons and aiding families in saving water. He mentioned improved food processing and sharing India's knowledge with African farmers, with support for India's efforts to battle disease and increase educational exchanges.","Obama makes wide-ranging speech to parliament in New Delhi .

"London (CNN) -- Prince William is to be deployed next February to the Falkland Islands in his role as a search and rescue pilot, the British Ministry of Defence said Thursday.

The deployment is part of the normal crew rotation for the air force and will form part of his training and career progression, the statement said. The air force provides 24-hour search and rescue cover year-round from the base. William, whose marriage in April to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was watched by millions around the world, qualified as a search and rescue pilot in September last year. He has been flying Sea King helicopters for the Royal Air Force from a base in Anglesey, Wales. Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, opened the Mount Pleasant base to which his nephew will be deployed over two decades ago. Living conditions are said to be basic and isolated. William will need to be back in Britain in time to help with preparations for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee -- marking 60 years since she took the throne -- to be celebrated next June. His deployment will be seen as somewhat sensitive, coming 30 years after Britain and Argentina went to war over the Falklands. Known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, the islands lie off the South American country's coast in the South Atlantic and have been under British rule since 1833. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinean and 255 British military personnel died. Britain retained control of the islands after the war.","NEW: Prince William is being sent as part of a normal crew rotation, the military says .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Agitated Egyptians carried the wounded -- bleeding and in shock -- to a makeshift clinic on the doorstep of a mosque. A young man's face turned green as a doctor in a blood-stained lab coat pulled up his shirt and began swabbing the puncture wounds in his stomach. ""Rubber bullet,"" one bystander explained. The man was among thousands of demonstrators who converged Saturday on Egypt's Interior Ministry, one of the most visible signs of state authority in Egypt. They pressed against police lines despite shotgun pellets and tear gas in a chaotic scene that left people spitting up blood and stumbling down crowded streets. Chanting men carried one man's body, wrapped in an Egyptian flag, away from the turmoil. He had been shot at the Interior Ministry, a weeping man said. The clashes killed at least one person and left 60 others hurt in three hours Saturday afternoon, said Dr. Radab Ali, who was treating the injuries at the mosque. Another doctor at the mosque said five people had died. ""We tried to go to the Interior Ministry building,"" said Emad Hamdi, a young man with a white bandage on his left cheek. ""They started shooting us."" The bloodshed around the Interior Ministry contrasted sharply with the festive scene not far away in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where cheering crowds climbed on Egyptian military tanks and men and women lay smiling and chatting on the grass. Even though police had disappeared from much of the rest of Cairo after days of protests, they had surrounded the Interior Ministry and were firing on protesters with rubber bullets, tear gas and live rounds, according to journalist Ian Lee, who witnessed the clash. He described the situation as something of a last stand for the authorities at one of the country's last symbols of the Mubarak regime. ""That is their headquarters,"" he said. ""If that falls, then, as many protesters here would say, that would be like a checkmate."" Lee described a back-and-forth scene as a sea of protesters would surge towards the ministry building, only to have police set up on rooftops and adjacent alleys, open fire and push them back. ""It's so loud and it's so frequent,"" Lee said of the gunshots. ""You're hearing it continuously in the background, the thud of gunshots and of tear gas."" Still, before long, protesters would reassemble and resume their push, chanting anti-government slogans, Lee said. Despite the live fire, protesters said they will not stop until the ministry building is torched. ""This is the last stand,"" said one young protester. ""The building symbolizes what many Egyptians see as the abuse, torture and corruption that were rampant in the police force."" The violence took its toll. One man spat up blood as others dragged him away with an apparent gunshot wound to the head. Another stumbled down crowded streets, also spitting blood. Ambulances couldn't get through the thick crowds to evacuate the wounded. ""Egypt has been under emergency rule for the last almost 30 years now and the police have been able to do almost whatever they would like without consequence, and the people are now responding to that."" Lee said. ""This is a huge symbol for people.""","NEW: Police at Interior Ministry fire live rounds, rubber bullets and tear gas .

"(CNN) -- Paris Saint Germain recorded their first home victory of the season at Parc des Princes with a comfortable 2-0 win over Toulouse on Friday. Goals in either half by Argentina's Javier Pastore and Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned Carlo Ancelotti's men their second successive league win and lifts them to third in Ligue 1 behind leaders Olympic Marseille and second-placed Lyon. Pastore opened the scoring seven minutes before the break when he latched onto Marco Verratti's through ball before lofting the ball over Ali Ahamada in the Toulouse goal. Ibrahimovic scored his fifth goal for his new club midway through the second half tapping home from close range after French international Jeremy Menez had beaten the offside trap. Reigning champions, Montpellier indifferent start to the season continued with a 3-1 loss away to newly-promoted Reims. Rene Girard's side are currently lying 14th, while Reims second win of the season sees them rise to eighth. Meanwhile in Italy, Juventus coach Antonio Conte's 10-month ban for corruption has been extended by football's world governing body, FIFA to include all matches worldwide. ""This suspension covers all types of matches, including domestic, international, friendly and official fixtures,"" a statement on the FIFA website said. Conte, who led Juventus to the Serie A title last season, was suspended by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on August 10 for failing to report alleged corruption in two Serie B matches when he was previously in charge of then second flight Siena in 2010-11. The 43-year-old, who appealed, but failed to overturn the FIGC ban, will now not take charge of the Turin club's upcoming Champions League campaign which kicks off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on September 19.","Goals in either half from Javier Pastore and Zlatan Ibrahimovic earn Paris Saint Germain a 2-0 win over Toulouse .

"(CNN) -- Prince William and his wife, Catherine, will visit a fire-stricken town in central Alberta on Wednesday, the seventh day of their Canadian tour. Slave Lake was devastated by a May wildfire that destroyed homes and other structures. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will meet emergency services personnel from the fire brigade, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the medical response team in the town before visiting with families affected by the disaster. Later Wednesday, the royal couple will head to Calgary, Alberta, for a series of events Thursday and Friday. William and Catherine are expected to visit a total of four provinces and one territory during their nine-day tour -- their first official foreign trip as a married couple. On Tuesday, William and Catherine made the northernmost stops of their journey when they visited sites in the Northwest Territories. The couple took in customary aboriginal activities, including traditional drumming, dancing and sports, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Afterward, William and Catherine spoke at a session of Youth Parliament and met with aboriginal elders and young adults from the Northwest Territories. On Monday, William and Catherine toured Prince Edward Island, racing in dueling dragon boats and visiting Province House, the second-oldest active legislature building in Canada. Afterward, the couple headed to Dalvay-by-the-Sea. There, Prince William -- a military helicopter pilot by training -- joined his Canadian counterparts in taking part in a ""waterbird"" emergency landing in a nearby lake. In the exercise, which was originated by Canadian armed forces for use in search-and-rescue missions, the helicopter's engine is cut off and it then lands in the water. When it is about one-quarter submerged, the propellers are restarted to bring the helicopter back toward the sky. The Prince Edward Island visit came a day after the most controversial stop on their tour in the French-speaking province of Quebec. William and Catherine attended a ""Freedom of the City"" ceremony at Quebec City Hall, where the prince addressed the crowd in French after being met by cheering supporters. Nearby, a small but vocal group of anti-monarchy protesters gathered. Quebec's relationship with the monarchy has often been strained, with the queen met by booing protesters on a visit to the province in 1964. The royal couple also visited Maison Dauphine, a center that provides assistance to troubled street youth in Quebec. They posed for pictures and seemed at ease as artists showed off their work. The prince played a quick game of foosball. The duke and duchess started their Canadian tour last Thursday in Ottawa, Ontario. After they wrap up their tour on Friday, the duke and duchess will head to California for three days.

"London (CNN) -- What do you give the person who has everything? Well, a camel saddle, mosquito traps and a hatstand full of baseball caps were among the gifts handed to British royals during their overseas trips last year, an official list released Tuesday shows. Clarence House releases the list of gifts each year, but a spokesman told CNN he could not specify which ones the royals have used themselves, which have been put on display and which have gone into storage. The gifts include those presented to Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; as well as Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall; by individuals as well as governments and official bodies. Prince William made a solo trip to New Zealand and Australia, both Commonwealth nations, in March, shortly before his wedding in April. Among the gifts he received in New Zealand were carved and inscribed fragments of buildings in Christchurch, the city rocked by a series of powerful earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. He was also given a selection of baseball caps, books and jewelry -- the last likely intended for his bride-to-be. More hats and caps came Prince William's way in Australia, not to mention a selection of sports jerseys, a cricket jacket, some Aboriginal artwork, a papier-mache model of a cassowary -- a large flightless bird -- and a cuddly toy handed over by emergency services workers. He was also treated to a jar of Vegemite, a yeast extract spread popular with Australians that is eaten on toast. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard tried to convert President Barack Obama to the vegetarian spread while visiting the United States in March -- without success. In June and July, William and Catherine traveled together to Canada and the United States, in what was their first official visit as a married couple -- and her first experience of a royal tour. There William, himself a qualified search-and-rescue pilot, received gifts including a flight helmet by the Canadian Air Force and a Canadian Ranger Patrol knife. Catherine, meanwhile, was given fascinators in tartan and peacock feather, as well as an assortment of scarves, dresses, shoes and jewelry. The newlyweds were jointly treated to matching black hoodies by Calgary Rotary Challenge Park, as well as a pair of chef's jackets, after taking a cooking class in Montreal. The Ministry of Health gave them two mosquito traps, while their creature comforts were also taken care of with gifts of whiskey, wine and champagne. The couple's stay in the United States was more low-key, with gifts including coasters, a bread board and a copy of the Chicago Daily Sun & Times newspaper. Among the more exotic gifts presented to Charles and Camilla were a ""camel saddle and trappings"" in Morocco. Weapons were also taken care of with the presentation of a ceremonial sword in Kuwait, a dagger in Morocco and a set of Zulu spears and shields in South Africa, not to mention a beaded hunting stick presented by Maasai tribal leaders in Tanzania. In Spain and Portugal, local produce came to the fore, with bottles of olive oil and port, jars of marmalade and ham on the list. Spain's own royal family opted to give the couple two books and a leather box of fruit and vegetable seeds. According to Clarence House, no gifts can be sold but the royals can choose to give perishable produce to local good causes like hospitals or hospices. The rest will either be kept safely in storage or put on display in St James's Palace, Clarence House or other private residences, a spokesman said. The presents are not considered the personal property of their royal recipients, although they can be worn or used by them, and are kept in trust for the nation. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","A list of gifts made to the royals on official overseas visits is released each year .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Prince William and his wife, Catherine, combine commerce and charity work during their three days in Southern California, including participation in a polo competition Saturday afternoon. While Hollywood stars and Beverly Hills socialites angled for invitations to their events, the last leg of their whirlwind North American tour includes interaction with commoners and even a visit to skid row in Los Angeles. A Royal Canadian Air Force jet brought the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Los Angeles from their last stop in Calgary, Canada Friday afternoon. California Gov. Jerry Brown and his wife greeted them as they stepped off the plane. The couple immediately convoyed to a technology conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel where they browsed the exhibits of British and American companies. William and Catherine chatted with venture capitalists and technology leaders individually, but they did not address the group. While Beverly Hills is heavily populated with celebrities, the visit by the recently married couple has created a major stir. Spago, Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, offered a British menu for the duration, including dishes served during the royal wedding festivities. The Beverly Hills eatery added Yorkshire pudding to it's menu for the weekend. William and Catherine are a ""fresh new young couple who are decidedly in love,"" Spago co-founder Barbara Lazaroff said. Beverly Hills women donned their finest hats, including the ""Fascinators"" style that created a fashion stir at the wedding. ""It looked devine,"" Lazaroff said. ""It was like the way people used to dress to go to the theater."" Police kept the city's famously aggressive paparazzi at bay Friday evening as the royal newlyweds attended a private party at the British consul general's Hollywood home. Neighbors surrounding the residence, where the royals also spent the night, gave police permission to arrest any photographers caught on private property. Catherine will watch as Prince William participates in the ""Foundation Polo Challenge"" Saturday at the Santa Barbara Polo & Racquet Club in Carpinteria, California. They'll returned to Los Angeles for a Saturday evening party at the Belasco Theater. BAFTA, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, is inviting several dozen up and coming British thespians to mingle with Hollywood's elite. The royal presence is intended to boost the careers of the Brits. Sunday, their last day in California, will start with a visit to Los Angeles' skid row where they'll see an arts program for inner-city children. The last public event ""aims to strengthen"" the ties between British and U.S. military, a news release said. Prince William and Catherine will mingle with military veterans gathered at Sony Studios for a job fair. Before they left for the United States Friday, William and Catherine kicked off the Calgary Stampede in Canada, where parade-goers got a glimpse of the royal couple. The royal newlyweds donned cowboy hats and watched as musicians and dancers performed at the annual event. The Alberta government hosted a reception for the royal couple at the Calgary zoo. Finally, they attended a departure ceremony, complete with full military honors and a 21-gun salute. The newlyweds started their Canadian tour last week in Ottawa, Ontario.","Prince William competes in a polo competition Saturday .

"London (CNN) -- The intricate lace and embroidery of Catherine Middleton's wedding dress wowed millions as they watched her walk down the aisle with Prince William. Now, almost three months later, there's a chance for royal wedding fans to take a closer look. The ivory and white satin gown and nine-foot train, designed by Sarah Burton for the Alexander McQueen fashion house, is on display at Buckingham Palace from Friday to October 3, as part of the palace's annual summer opening. Visitors will be able to admire close-up the handiwork of the Royal School of Needlework, which made the lace applique for the bodice and skirt by hand, using techniques dating back almost two centuries. The design incorporates the rose, thistle, shamrock and daffodil, to represent each nation in the United Kingdom. The Duchess of Cambridge's ivory duchess satin and lace wedding shoes and her silk-tulle veil are also on show at the palace, in central London, presented by the Royal Collection -- a trust which looks after royal art, jewellery and valuables for the nation. And her bridal bouquet -- which included lily of the valley, Sweet William, hyacinth, myrtle and ivy -- has been recreated from artificial flowers for the display. The diamond drop earrings she wore on the day can also be seen. Commissioned by her parents as a personal gift for the occasion, the design was inspired by the Middleton family's new coat of arms. The ensemble prompted the prince to say ""you look beautiful,"" as his bride arrived at the altar on the arm of her father Michael on April 29. The duchess worked closely with designer Burton to create the dress, which was the subject of months of speculation in fashion circles in the months leading up to the wedding. For those more interested in food, the duke and duchess's eight-tier fruit wedding cake, created by cake designer Fiona Cairns, is on show in the palace's state dining room, the Royal Collection said. The top three tiers have been made again for the display, as the couple sliced the original third tier to serve to guests and kept the top two tiers for themselves. The summer opening tour of Buckingham Palace also includes its 19 state rooms and a walk along the south side of the palace garden.","Catherine's wedding dress, veil and shoes are on show in London .

"(CNN) -- The United States' national soccer team has pulled out of a planned friendly match in Cairo next month due to the political instability in Egypt. Coach Bob Bradley's side was scheduled to play the six-time African champions on February 9, but will now be without a fixture on that date. ""We were excited about the opportunity to play against Egypt, but due to the current situation all parties agreed it was best to cancel the match,"" U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati told his federation's website on Monday. ""We appreciate the efforts of the Egyptian Football Association and the U.S. State Department as we worked through this situation.""

The matches are in preparation for the CONCACAF Gold Cup to be held in the U.S. in June, which features 12 nations from North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Anti-government protesters have been demonstrating for the past week against Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, who has ruled for three decades.

"Mukono, Uganda (CNN) -- A pastor rebuked homosexuals at the funeral of a Ugandan gay rights activist, prompting chaos as sympathizers stormed the pulpit and grabbed his microphone away. David Kato, 46, a prominent rights campaigner in the east African nation, was beaten to death with a hammer this week in his house near the the capital, Kampala. His name and photo were printed on the cover of a tabloid newspaper late last year that called for gays to be executed under a banner that read: ""Hang them."" His funeral spiraled into chaos after the pastor denounced homosexuals, saying they ""would go to hell."" Mayhem ensued as mourners took away the pastor's microphone and police whisked him away from the angry crowds. A sympathetic Anglican bishop stepped in and laid Kato to rest as hundreds gathered Friday in the small hillside village outside the capital, Kampala. Mourners included embassy staff and diplomats from various countries, and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Activists wore black T-shirts with Kato's picture on it and rainbow colored-flags associated with the gay pride. Tears -- and tributes -- flowed as family members wailed while others collapsed. A statement was read from U.S. President Barack Obama, who condemned the killing and urged authorities to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice. Police have said initial investigations are focusing on robbery in Kato's rough Mukono neighborhood, but rights activists said he was a victim of homophobia. One suspect -- Kato's driver -- has been arrested while another man is still at large, authorities said. The second suspect is an ex-convict who was staying with Kato before his death. Human rights activist Naomi Ruzindana said the killing is not a robbery gone wrong. ""I don't think it's a coincidence that it happened ... he had got threats over and again,"" she said. Earlier this year, Kato and two activists won a case against the magazine that published the list. The court ruled that media in Uganda are barred from releasing details of known or potential homosexuals in the country. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. Ugandan lawmakers shelved a controversial ""anti-gay"" proposal introduced in 2009 that would impose tough penalties against homosexuality -- including life imprisonment and the death penalty.","Pastor berates homosexuals, says they'll ""go to hell""

"(CNN) -- In an instance of truth being stranger than fiction, American author Herman Melville turned to a horrifying ordeal as inspiration for his 19th-century classic ""Moby-Dick."" In 1820, the Nantucket, Massachusetts, whaling vessel Essex was rammed and sunk in the South Pacific by a sperm whale. George Pollard Jr. and his surviving crew, initially using three small boats that were aboard the Essex, resorted to cannibalism while they drifted in the open ocean for more than two months before being picked up by other vessels. The sea truly must have been Pollard's mistress, for he took command of another whaler. The captain and Two Brothers were off Hawaii on February 11, 1823, when the ship hit a shallow reef. The terrified crew, clinging to small boats, was rescued the next day by a fellow whaler. Some 188 years later, maritime heritage archaeologists, working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found the Two Brothers shipwreck nearly 600 miles northwest of Honolulu, the agency said in a statement Friday. ""This rare archaeological discovery is the first discovery of a wrecked whaling ship from Nantucket, Mass., the birthplace of America's whaling industry,"" the agency said. Whaling ships, part of America's expansion into the Pacific Ocean, explored portions of the Indian Ocean and the polar regions. Expeditions from 2008 to 2010 yielded a large anchor of Two Brothers, cast-iron pots for melting whale blubber, bricks, whaling lances, harpoon tips, glass, ceramics and remains of the ship's rigging, NOAA said. Research and accounts from crew members helped verify the find. The shipwreck lies off French Frigate Shoals in the blue waters of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in Hawaii. Melville completed ""Moby-Dick"" in 1851, drawing on an Essex crew member's account of the remarkable event. The twice-cursed Pollard retired from whaling, became a watchman and lived to be almost 80. Melville met him in Nantucket shortly after completing ""Moby-Dick."" Author Nathaniel Philbrick wrote about Two Brothers and the Essex in ""In the Heart of the Sea."" While the Essex story is linked to ""Moby-Dick,"" Pollard must not have been the inspiration for its mercurial Captain Ahab. ""To the islanders he was a nobody,"" Melville said of Pollard, according to the Nantucket Historical Association. ""To me, the most impressive man, tho' wholly unassuming, even humble -- that I ever encountered.""","Archaeologists find remains of whaling ship Two Brothers .

"(CNN) -- Algeria has officially lifted its 19-year-old state of emergency, according to the national Algerian Press Service. The action lifts restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly imposed to combat an Islamist insurgency. The country's Council of Ministers approved the repeal Tuesday, state-run media reported. The move comes as Algeria, like other Arab nations, faces a wave of protest that has toppled regimes in Egypt and Tunisia and led to open revolt in against longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi in neighboring Libya. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced earlier this month that he would soon lift the emergency declaration, first imposed in 1992 and indefinitely renewed in 1993. The emergency declaration was part of a clampdown on Islamist movements during a civil war that left more than 150,000 dead. But critics say the insurgency has long since diminished, and the law remained only to muzzle critics of the government. Bouteflika's National Liberation Front has ruled the country since winning independence from France in 1962, and Bouteflika has been in office since 1999. U.S. analysts say Algeria faces some of the same problems that fueled uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt -- high rates of unemployment and a stagnant economy in particular. Protests over food prices began in January but quickly led to calls for political reform. Earlier this week, anti-government protesters clashed with police and pro-government demonstrators, opposition leaders said. The country's long-running clampdown began in 1991 when an Islamist party led early balloting in Algeria's first multiparty parliamentary elections. The military stepped in, canceled the second round of voting and launched a campaign against the Islamists that led to a full-scale insurgency, which effectively ended about a decade later. Human Rights Watch has said Algeria's government controls state broadcast outlets and sharply restricts private newspapers, with journalists facing prosecution for criticism of public officials.","The action lifts restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly .

"(EW.com) -- Fox's ""American Idol"" is getting closer to finalizing a judges panel for its 12th season. Sources say Latin singer-songwriter Enrique Iglesias has now received a firm offer for a spot on the reality hit, which may expand to four judges next year despite shedding its entire previous panel. EW.com reported last week that rapper Nicki Minaj and Aussie country artist Keith Urban were poised to join pop diva Mariah Carey on the show, and that Iglesias (or, if he passes, Adam Lambert) could fill a fourth spot. Longtime Idol judge Randy Jackson is set to move to a mentor role. Now we're hearing Iglesias has received an offer for about $4 million per year, on par with Urban's deal. Fox and producers have only confirmed Carey at this point and have no comment on any of the other names or the number of judges. If the current panel plan comes together it will give Idol a four-quadrant strategy, with judges representing pop, rap, country and Latin music (sorry rock-and-roll, but have you looked at the charts lately?). Idol tried expanding to four judges once before and the network was said to be unhappy with the result, so this possibility is a bit surprising. But NBC's The Voice managed to have four judges from different music backgrounds that have worked together quite well. Plus, Fox's own The X Factor has a quartet of judges, too. Iglesias has a history of turning down reality show offers, but may very well sign on to ""Idol."" He was previously offered a spot hosting X Factor, and was in talks with NBC for ""The Voice."" With his career going ""full blast,"" Iglesias doesn't need the Idol gig, but the show does have other career benefits. Iglesias became available to join the show last week, having just finished his latest world tour where he partnered with former Idol judge Jennifer Lopez. ""American Idol"" returns to Fox in January.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A landmark ruling that legalized gay sex between consenting partners in India was challenged Thursday in the country's high court, lawyers said. Activists protest against the ruling to decriminalize gay sex in New Delhi on Sunday. The supreme court issued a notice to the nonprofit Naz Foundation that had won a lower-court verdict after a seven-year legal fight to decriminalize gay sex. Notices also were issued to the federal government and the New Delhi high court, which ruled last week that consensual sex between partners of the same gender was legal. An astrologer filed a petition challenging the ruling. The petitioner argued that no constitutional right is violated by the Indian penal code's Section 377, which had outlawed gay sex, said his lawyer Praveen Agrawal. The petition also cited Indian culture and health as grounds for seeking a stay on last week's ruling, he said. The supreme court posted the next hearing for July 20. Last week's ruling meant the law -- Indian penal code section 377, which had previously criminalized consensual homosexual acts between adults -- was partly struck down but remains in place as far as forced homosexual acts are concerned. The verdict affects law enforcement all around India because it deals with a law enacted by the federal parliament. India's Ministry of Home Affairs opposed changes to the law on grounds that decriminalizing homosexual conduct would ""open the floodgates of delinquent behavior.""  Watch a report on why discrimination is likely to continue » . But Human Rights Watch called the ruling ""a victory for basic rights to privacy, non-discrimination and liberty."" UNAIDS, the joint United Nations program on AIDS, also applauded the ruling, saying it restored dignity and human rights. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling would eventually lead to legalization of gay marriages in the country. ""This, I think, will be the next level of demand from the gay community,"" Jaisingh said. Jaisingh said she had fought for legalization of homosexuality for seven years on behalf of the Naz Foundation. The group says its ""primary aim is to improve the sexual health and human rights of marginalized males who have sex with males, their partners and families in South Asia and elsewhere."" Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh leaders had warned that they will oppose moves to decriminalize homosexuality.","Ruling legalizing consensual gay sex in India challenged in country's high court .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored, the Interior Department's inspector general concluded in a report released Wednesday. In one case, an inspector in the Minerals Management Service office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report states. Others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil, with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in. Some in the same office accepted tickets to the 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, a college football bowl game in Atlanta, Georgia. One inspector told an office clerk, ""Everyone has gotten some sort of gift before at some point"" from companies they regulated, according to the report. Investigators from the inspector general's office, the Interior Department's independent watchdog agency, took their findings to federal prosecutors in Louisiana, the report states. But the U.S. attorney's office in Lake Charles declined to bring charges, according to the report. Full coverage of the Gulf oil spill . ""Through numerous interviews, we found a culture where the acceptance of gifts from oil and gas companies were widespread throughout that office,"" the report states. However, that culture waned after a supervisor in the agency's New Orleans, Louisiana, regional office was fired for taking a gift from a regulated company in 2007, the report found. The period covered in the report is well before the April explosion that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are trying to cap a month later. But Mary Kendall, the Interior Department's acting inspector general, said she pushed for the report's early release in the wake of the disaster. ""Of greatest concern to me is the environment in which these inspectors operate -- particularly the ease with which they move between industry and government,"" Kendall wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Many of the inspectors joined MMS from the industry and had relationships with people in the business that originated ""well before they took their jobs with industry or government."" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said the report showed the agency's safety enforcement procedures need an extensive overhaul. ""They're supposed to be the cops on the beat, and instead they're out tailgating at sports events with people they're supposed to be policing,"" said Wyden, who leads a Senate Environment subcommittee on public lands. ""That's just not acceptable."" The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them. Salazar, who has ordered a widespread shake-up of the agency since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, called Tuesday's report ""yet another reason to clean house."" ""This deeply disturbing report is further evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of MMS and the oil and gas industry,"" Salazar said in a statement on the report. He pledged to follow through with the inspector general's recommendations, ""including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution."" While the report predates the Deepwater Horizon spill, Salazar said he has asked Kendall to investigate whether inspectors failed to enforce standards aboard the rig. Its sinking left 11 men lost at sea and oil spilling into the Gulf. Kendall is scheduled to appear before the House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday. Wyden said Salazar ""is heading in the right direction"" by reorganizing the agency, but he said MMS needs a bigger shakeup. ""Secretary Salazar has moved, in my view, as it relates to royalty payments and financial irregularities,"" he said. ""Now he has got to come down with hobnail boots on some of these ethical violations, and drain the safety swamp."" MMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009. Salazar announced last week that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have conflicting missions. The associate director for the agency's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May, a month earlier than planned, in the wake of the Gulf spill. That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts from an offshore drilling contractor valued at more than $6,600, according to the report. Danielle Brian, executive director of the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight, said earlier this month that the agency has been lax about collecting royalties from an industry it sees as ""a partner, a client."" She pointed out that Randall Luthi, its previous director, left at the end of the Bush administration to become president of the National Ocean Industries Association, the trade association that represents offshore drillers. ""That really gives you a picture of the people who have been running the shop here,"" Brian said. CNN's Dugald McConnell and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Roughly 200 Iraqi protesters hit the streets Friday in central Baghdad, the latest in a string of Middle East cities to be affected by the wave of unrest sweeping the region. Protesters are also trying to organize a larger demonstration -- part of what they are now calling the ""Iraqi revolution"" -- for next Friday. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told reporters ""there should be no problem"" issuing official permission for a larger protest if a formal request is made. The prime minister expressed concern, however, that protesters could be ""infiltrated by saboteurs either from those who lost in (Iraq's recent) elections or by the remains of the Baathists or al-Qaeda terrorists."" Iraq, like many of its neighbors, has been convulsed by popular protests since demonstrations toppled the leader of Tunisia last month. One person was killed and 57 were injured Thursday when hundreds of protesters clashed with security forces in Sulaimaniya, a city in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, according to Dr. Raykot Hamed Salih, a health official there. Dozens of protesters attacked the Kurdistan Democratic Party headquarters in the city and destroyed furniture and computers inside the building, police officials in Sulaimaniya told CNN. Witnesses told CNN that Kurdish security forces, known as peshmerga, opened fire to disperse the protesters. The demonstrators were angry about corruption, the quality of basic services and unemployment, Salih said. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video . Meanwhile, at least one person was shot dead and 55 others -- including four police -- were wounded Wednesday when private security guards and Iraqi security forces fired on hundreds of demonstrators outside the governor's office in the eastern city of Kut, health officials said. Human Rights Watch released a statement Thursday demanding that Iraqi authorities allow an independent investigation of the recent violence.

"Quebec City (CNN) -- Prince William and his wife Catherine touched down in Prince Edward Island Sunday, winding down the fourth day of their Canadian tour. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had visited a center for troubled street youth and attended a ""Freedom of the City"" ceremony at Quebec City Hall earlier in the day. They were met by cheering supporters at City Hall, where Prince William addressed the crowd in French. Nearby, a small but vocal group of anti-monarchy protesers gathered. The royal couple also visited Maison Dauphine, which provides assistance to troubled street youth in Quebec. They posed for pictures and seemed at ease as artists showed off their work. Prince William played a quick game of foosball. William and Catherine began their day with a bilingual morning prayer service aboard the HMCS Montreal, a naval ship, as the pair's first official foreign trip as a married couple continued. They are expected to visit four provinces during their nine-day tour, which ends Friday. On Saturday evening, William and Catherine had arrived in Montreal to a small group of demonstrators -- carrying signs and chanting slogans -- who opposed the newlywed couple's tour and the British monarchy they represent. Canada is part of the Commonwealth of Nations -- a loose association of nations that were once part of the British Empire. Earlier Saturday, William and Catherine wrapped up their last day in Ottawa by planting a tree and meeting with Canadian war veterans. The royal couple joined a long list of illustrious international visitors when they ceremonially planted a Canadian hemlock on the grounds of Rideau Hall. They then greeted veterans of conflicts and peacekeeping missions, including some who have served in Afghanistan, and representatives of the many British women who migrated to Canada to start a new life after World War II. Later on Saturday, the pair traveled to French-speaking Quebec province, where they toured a flagship Montreal hospital dedicated to the care of mothers and children. Canadian broadcaster CBC reports that Quebec's relationship with the monarchy has often been strained, with the Queen met by booing protesters on a visit to the province in 1964. Prince William and the duchess had received a largely warm welcome since arriving in Ottawa Thursday. They had joined a crowd of almost 300,000 Canadians Friday to mark the celebration of Canada Day, on the 144th anniversary of the country's independence. The couple's itinerary also includes stops in the Northwest Territories and Alberta. After they wrap up their Canadian tour, the duke and duchess will head to California for three days.","NEW: Prince William and his wife Catherine arrive in Prince Edward Island .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""The King's Speech"" story knocked around in David Seidler's head for half a century before he finished writing the screenplay for the film, which is now nominated for a dozen Academy Awards. Any sooner and it might have been ""a fairly reasonable script,"" but not likely good enough to earn an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay, Seidler said. It demanded ""a more mature writer."" ""I don't think it would have been the same,"" he said, as he sipped hot tea in the Beverly Hills Hotel's Polo Lounge. During lunch, Seidler opened a large envelope holding an original photograph of King George VI sitting with President Franklin Roosevelt. The photo, a gift from collector Keya Morgan, was taken in June 1939, just three months before he delivered the dramatic radio address that is the climax of his movie. ""He's trying to look relaxed, but it's not relaxed at all,"" Seidler said, pointing to the king's crossed hands. He noticed Roosevelt's legs were not covered with a blanket, as was the usual pose. ""You can see the braces,"" he said. ""That's just about the only photograph I've ever seen of him without the blanket. That's very unusual."" Seidler spoke about the similarity between Roosevelt's paralyzed legs, a public secret, and King George VI's speech impediment, which was ""swept under the royal carpet."" ""Not much is written about it, because the royal stutterer is a source of embarrassment,"" Seidler said. ""Stuttering was considered a speech defect and if you had a speech defect, you were, by definition, a defective person."" But the king was a royal inspiration to Seidler, who himself began stuttering as a child while sailing from his native England to the United States to escape the German bombing. Seidler, now 73, was a college student when he first decided to write about how King George VI overcame his stutter to lead Britain through World War II with inspiring radio addresses. Searching the pain of his own childhood gave Seidler the words he needed for ""The King's Speech,"" he said. But it was not something he could do until later in life, he said. ""This required going back into the pain and the loneliness and the isolation and frustration of being a stutterer,"" Seidler said. ""And being a stutterer is rather like having a very bad toothache. When you've got the toothache, all you're thinking about is 'Wow, my tooth really hurts.' All I can think about is that pain. As soon as you get to the dentist and the dentist fixes it, the last thing you want to remember is how that tooth ached. You just blank it out, the mind forgets it."" It took many years for Seidler to allow his mind to recall what it was like to be a stutterer, he said. ""But as a more mature writer, let me put it that way, when you start looking back on your life, it is easier to go back into the past and therefore, I was able to really put my head back into being a stutterer, which I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise,"" he said. The long wait was not self-imposed, but was a royal request from Elizabeth, the queen mother. The king's widow sent a letter granting her blessing to the effort if Seidler waited until after her death. ""The memory of these events is still too painful,"" she wrote in 1982. ""I knew what she meant,"" Seidler said. ""It was her grief over the loss of her husband at a very early age; he was in his early 50s when he died, because he had the stress of being the reluctant king, a position he wasn't trained for, wasn't suited for. And she just didn't want to be reminded of what had happened."" As a good British subject, he waited. ""I didn't think I had that much longer to wait,"" he said. ""She was a very old lady at the time. I thought a couple years, three or four at the most."" She lived for two more decades, dying in 2002 at the age of 101. Her long life may give the 73-year-old Seidler the distinction of being the oldest writer to win an Oscar for an original screenplay.","David Seidler drew upon his childhood pain as a stutterer to write the screenplay .

"Carpinteria, California (CNN) -- Prince William and his polo team won a round-robin match Saturday, garnering them a sterling silver and gold trophy -- weighing 14.7 pounds in the precious metals -- after he scored four goals in the final game. His team won the pivotal game 5-3. ""A storybook ending here at Santa Barbara!"" the announcer told hundreds of spectators at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club. A confident prince had predicted he would win the 18-inch-tall trophy, exclusively created by Tiffany silversmiths for the match. His wife, Catherine, awarded the trophy cup to William and his three teammates after the royal couple exchanged congratulatory kisses on both cheeks. She also gave Tiffany gifts to all 12 polo players who played on the three teams participating in the six chukkars, or six periods, of Saturday's play. Before the game, the prince declared he and wife Catherine arrived at ""one of the most beautiful polo grounds anywhere in the world"" to raise money for charity and compete. ""I'm not a good loser,"" he joked with hundreds of guests under a white tent as they prepared to eat lunch, adding he wanted to win. Three polo teams competed at 3 p.m. PT at the polo club, which is the third-oldest polo facility in the United States and is celebrating its 100th birthday this year. ""Here's to the next century and a very happy birthday!"" the prince saluted the crowd and the polo club's leaders at a pre-game reception. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived about noon by helicopter from Los Angeles, where they're staying during their three-day U.S. visit. The duchess was wearing a knee-length dress, without a hat. The prince's visit to the polo grounds was an effort to make a royal sport more accessible to Americans accustomed to football and baseball. ""A major misconception is it is only something princes play,"" Ebe Sievwright, a player and coach with the California Polo Club who said he has played with Prince William, said in an interview with CNN. ""It's not just something you can pick up overnight, but it is something pretty much anyone from any socio-economic strata could play if they just knew more about it,"" Sievwright said. At his noon reception, the prince highlighted how sport can affect people. ""Catherine and I have had a busy few days, so the prospect of being able to let loose this afternoon is wonderful for me,"" the prince told his guests. ""But that's what sport is all about, be it polo or football -- sorry, I mean soccer -- or whatever your preferred sport is,"" he continued, prompting laughter. ""How sport helps young people to find purpose in life is a key element to the foundation that Catherine, Harry and I have established,"" he said. Saturday's play benefitted the American Friends of the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry, which was just established in April. The foundation supports disadvantaged children and young persons, conservation and sustainable development, and veterans and military families. Tickets for the lunch and a VIP seat to the game cost $4,000 each. About 400 persons had been expected to buy such tickets, ensuring at least $1.6 million being raised for charity. Before the game, experts said the Duke of Cambridge would experience a faster game than he's used to. ""There's huge differences,"" Sievwright said. ""Polo in England is very Argentine-influenced, and in America there is a great history of cowboys and riding from their own history out in the Wild West. ""In England everyone is very proper and tucked in,"" he continued. ""The game flows out here in America. In England lately, there's been a lot of stopping and controlling the ball, which kind of slows it up. So it will be interesting for William out in Santa Barbara to play in a game where it's really flowing like a pinball game."" Among those playing Saturday was Nic Roldan, captain of the U.S. polo team. His father and grandfather were professional polo players, and Roldan grew up playing the sport in West Palm Beach, Florida, where the game is popular, he said. The prince played for the Foundation Team, sponsored by Royal Salute Scotch Whiskey, and Roldan played on Team American Express Centurion. The Audi U.S. Polo Team, currently ranked second in the World Polo Tour standings, rounded out the three teams playing Saturday. The prince's team beat the Audi U.S. Polo Team in the final two chukkars. The day's activities included a private drinks reception and three-course luncheon prepared by chef Giada De Laurentiis, who's also the granddaughter of film producer Dino De Laurentiis. The menu featured sweet corn lasagna with blistered tomatoes as well as a pea pesto and beef tenderloin crostini. The lunch benefitted the royal brothers' charity and the Polo Training Center of Santa Barbara, organizers said. ""In terms of publicity and the sort of hype that this event is getting, I don't think I've ever experienced anything"" like it, Roldan said this week, before the match. Celebrities who came to see the match included actresses Jennifer Love Hewitt and Rosario Dawson and game-show host Pat Sajak. The game allowed Americans to size up how the prince played polo. He's known as being competitive but a good sport, Sievwright said. On Saturday, the prince had a slow start in his first match, but he finished strong in the second, pivotal game. The games opened the summer polo season. ""Will is disciplined,"" Sievwright said before the game. ""One of the aspects of the game is marking, and it's really important to stay with your man, shadow your man. It's like basketball in that way: Always be blocking, always be shadowing your man. And Will does that very conscientiously. He plays the defensive role."" ""He takes the man first and then plays the shots to his team, usually defensive shots. He's very good with backhand. Backhand is when you hit the ball backwards in defense. But he can also hit a clean, full, right-up-the-field as well."" But when compared to his father, Prince Charles, William is ""a challenged player,"" Sievwright said. Charles played the game so hard that he often suffered injuries, Sievwright said. ""Charles was crazy, crazy about polo. He really loved the game as his father did before him. And I think William loves it, but he also has an eye on many other things like flying helicopters,"" Sievwright said. As in American pro sports, polo has its share of ""polo wives,"" and that would include Catherine, William's wife, who will be enjoying the game from the viewing stands. ""I think Kate would enjoy polo because if she didn't, she may not have stuck around,"" Sievwright said. ""You get to know the rules if you are a wife or a girlfriend, so you root for your team. She may be holding the spare stick in case it breaks, but it's my suspicion that there might be someone else doing that on the day."" After the game, the royal couple were scheduled to return to Los Angeles, where they have been staying since Friday, and attend a British Academy of Film and Television Arts reception and dinner. The event will recognize 42 emerging British artists working in film, television and video games and promote relationships between Hollywood and the United Kingdom. William is president of BAFTA.

"(CNN) -- An alleged sexual assault of a Texas girl involving nearly 20 people was recorded on cell phones, and a video of the alleged incident was circulating among students in her school district, according to court documents obtained Tuesday. As of Monday, 13 adults and five juveniles had been arrested as part of the investigation, authorities said. A defense attorney for one of the suspects told CNN affiliate KPRC that the number of suspects could increase. ""I don't know the exact number of people involved,"" James Evans said. ""I've heard as many as 28 or more."" The case has sharply divided the community, according to CNN affiliate KHOU, which reported the girl was 11 years old. Darrel Broussard, assistant police chief for the Cleveland, Texas, Police Department, said Monday that the investigation into the incident ""is continuous,"" with more significant developments possible. Cleveland is about 50 miles northeast of Houston. ""There have been leads during our investigation that have alerted us to other possible persons of interest,"" Broussard told CNN. ""The investigation is ongoing."" The 18 individuals charged thus far are between 14 and 27 years old, he said. Those who are adults were indicted last month on a charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child. On Friday, the Cleveland Police Department announced that four students in the Cleveland Independent School District had been arrested on charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14. The juveniles appeared Monday in a Liberty County court in the town of Liberty. Police noted that some but not all suspects are students at Cleveland High School. Mike Little, the district attorney in Liberty County, said police would likely decide whether more people would be charged. He offered few other details, saying Monday, ""We are very careful about pretrial publicity."" The incident allegedly happened November 28 at two residences in Cleveland, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by CNN on Tuesday. The girl told a school district police chief about the incident, who notified Cleveland police on December 3, the affidavit said. The chief then interviewed employees of the Cleveland Independent School District who had heard of the incident, according to the documents. One employee spoke with several students ""who had seen the cell phone videos or heard of the incident,"" according to the affidavit. The girl told a forensic interviewer from a child advocacy center that one suspect called her ""and asked if she wanted to ride around"" on that day, the affidavit said. Three of the suspects picked her up and took her to one residence where a fourth suspect lived. The fourth suspect told her to take her clothes off, she said, adding that ""he would have some girls 'beat her up' or she would not be taken back to her residence if she did not comply."" the affidavit said. The girl said she engaged in sexual acts in the bedroom and bathroom of the residence. While in the bathroom, she said, she heard one suspect on the phone inviting other people over to have sex with her, and said when she came out of the bathroom four men she did not know were there, the affidavit said. The aunt of the suspect arrived home, however, and ""the victim and the other individuals left the residence in haste through the rear window of the house,"" according to the affidavit. After leaving, the girl said she and the others went to an abandoned trailer where the sexual acts continued, the affidavit said. ""Victim stated that digital still images and digital video images of the sex acts were recorded by one or more individuals using cellular telephones,"" according to the affidavit. Broussard told CNN on Tuesday that it took authorities months to investigate the incident and obtain indictments and arrest warrants. ""To put together the case, it takes time to do that,"" he said. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","A video was circulating among students in Cleveland, according to documents .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and his wife, Catherine, arrived Thursday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where the Duchess of Cambridge gave her first public speech outside the UK. It is the royal couple's second stop in their southeast Asian tour of Commonwealth nations to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. The duke and duchess ended their earlier visit in Singapore by paying their respects at the Kranji War Cemetery, a former site of a prisoner of war camp when the Japanese occupied Singapore during WWII. The war cemetery now holds the graves of nearly 4,500 Commonwealth casualties, including 850 that remain unidentified. They laid a wreath and also stopped at the Singapore Memorial, which honors the 24,000 casualties of Commonwealth land and air forces in southern Asia who have no known grave.

The couple then took a short flight to Kuala Lumpur, where they had lunch with Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohd Najib Tun Abdul Razak at his official residence, the Seri Perdana. Afterwards, the couple visited Hospis Malaysia, a hospice for terminally ill children and adults. While there, the duchess -- the patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices -- addressed patients and staff in her second ever public speech. ""This is a very special place and so much is already being achieved,"" she said of the hospice, one of nearly two dozen palliative care community providers in the country.

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that a critical phase in the transfer of security authority from international to domestic forces would begin March 21, a precursor to a planned full handover three years hence. Karzai made the announcement during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of diplomatic and military leaders from Western and other nations. ""We are determined to demonstrate Afghan leadership and ownership of the transition process,"" he said. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in an interview conducted with conference organizers and posted on its website, explained this move next month marks the start of ""a gradual transition to lead Afghan responsibility -- province by province, district by district."" Thus, Afghans may take over full control in some locales relatively soon, while the process may take much longer elsewhere. ""I'm very optimistic about this timetable leading to Afghan (security) responsibility all over Afghanistan by May 2014,"" said Rasmussen. ""But I have to add, that obviously this development will depend on conditions on the ground."" During his speech, Karzai credited the influx of 70,000 international forces in 2010 for improving the situation and helping Afghan security forces. He frequently mentioned the fight against the al Qaeda terror group, but did not mention the Taliban -- which was ousted from power in 2001, for harboring al Qaeda, and has been behind many attacks since. ""We have regained the initiative,"" Karzai said. ""Security in the country is better than it was a year before, and the year before that."" In a letter to troops late last month, U.S. Gen. David Petraeus voiced a similar sentiment, saying the surge ""inflicted enormous losses"" on militants and weakened terror networks. It came at a steep price: Last year was the deadliest for coalition and U.S. troops in Afghanistan since the war began. There were 708 such troops killed, of which 498 were American service members. Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said insurgents were now on the defensive in Afghanistan, and pointed specifically to progress in Kabul, where one-fifth of the Afghan population lives. Still, he cautioned that past success doesn't guarantee a smooth road ahead. ""In sum, 2010 was a year of significant, hard-fought accomplishments,"" Petraeus wrote. ""The year ahead is likely to be a tough one, too."" President Barack Obama has promised to begin a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan starting in July, a pledge he reiterated during his recent State of the Union address. During the speech Sunday, Karzai also acknowledged issues of corruption in Afghanistan, focusing especially on contracts that fell outside the Kabul government's control. The president outlined efforts to curb abuses, which is the past he said had ""undermined the capacity of the state rather than building it."" ""With the U.S. and NATO, we're overhauling the system to make contracting an instrument of good rather than bad governance,"" he said. By 2015, Karzai predicted that Afghanistan will have ""binding agreements with the United States and long-term partnerships with NATO"" -- noting that the shift in security responsibility does not mean a clean break with international forces that have been engaged there for nearly a decade. As to NATO's role, the current head of the military and political Western alliance said he expected that some of its troops may still be in Afghanistan even after 2014. ""I ... foresee a continued international presence, beyond the date when our combat mission ends, with the aim to assist the Afghans,"" Rasmussen said.

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Robbie Moore and Matt Hastings have been together for six years. As a gay couple, they've watched heterosexual members of their families celebrate their big days wondering if they will ever enjoy their own. But this week could herald the start of a new life for these two Tasmanians: Married life. In a bold move, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament will introduce the Same-Sex Marriage Bill co-sponsored by the ruling Labor party and the Greens. It is expected to easily pass. The more difficult proposition will be convincing the state's Upper House of 15 -- 13 of whom are independents -- to buy the argument of Premier Lara Giddings, that the change will deliver a AUS$100 million (US$103 million) economic boost to the state in gay tourism. If the upper house ticks off on the bill, Tasmania will become the first state in Australia to legalize same sex marriage. And there's every chance it will quickly be followed by South Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. If they succeed, they will join 11 nations where same sex marriage is now legal, including Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Spain and Norway, along with some U.S. states. New Zealand is also likely to pass same sex marriage laws. But as these historic changes blow across Australia, the prime minister, Julia Gillard, and her counterpart in opposition, Tony Abbott, insist marriage is a vow between a man and a woman. Rodney Croome begs to differ. He will be among those lining up to marry if the bill passes. ""The time for the proposal comes once the law is passed,"" he told CNN. ""I would love to marry but I think it's only right for me to propose that to the man I love once the law is passed."" The face of the gay rights lobby, which in 1997 defeated the Tasmanian law that made homosexuality a punishable crime, Croome is quietly confident as he acknowledges the challenges. For starters, there's the prospect of a High Court challenge to the law, if it passes. ""Prime Minister Gillard has not ruled it out,"" Croome said. ""This is important. Only the Commonwealth has the right to challenge a state law. Anyone else has to obtain standing before the High Court and to do that, they have to show a material disadvantage (as a result of the law) and it's hard to see how anyone -- such as the Catholic Church or the Australian Christian lobby could show that,"" he said. ""So if the Commonwealth says no, there may not be a challenge at all,"" he added. Between the law passing and any High Court challenge, it's anticipated thousands will marry. Croome estimates more than 50% of Tasmania's same sex couples will rush to the alter and many thousands will flock to Tasmania from other Australian states and territories to do the same. Moore, 30 and Hastings, 27, both feel same sex marriage in Tasmania, at least, is inevitable. ""We have seen the changes happening in the last decade,"" Moore, a union worker told CNN. ""Even just five years ago, you'd cop it just walking down the streets. But now that people are more socially aware and there's generational change, that paradigm is shifting so I don't get anywhere near as much slack. In fact, I get encouragement,"" he said. ""Having this issue in the media makes people think about it too,"" said Hastings, a hairdresser. For both men, at the heart of the same sex marriage issue is the question of social equality and personal validation. ""I grew up in Burnie on the north-west coast of Tasmania, which was very homophobic and it's been a long journey for me. And there are always the odd few people who are still narrow minded,"" said Moore. ""This is one of the last things that discriminates against gay people,"" added Hastings, referring to the Federal Marriage Act, which deems marriage as an act between a man and a woman. Neither man minds if the right to marry each other comes from the Tasmanian parliament rather than its Federal counterpart. Croome agrees. ""It's equality in Tasmania,"" he said. Many see it as paving the way for broader change. ""Some find it odd that it should proceed state by state but in every other federal nation around the world, the movement began at a state level -- Canada, the U.S., Argentina, Brazil,"" he said. ""So for Australia to begin at a state level is not an anomaly."" Public support for same sex marriage is patchy across Australia. But according to Croome, in Tasmania it is significant. ""It took years to reach this level of public support,"" he said. ""Some say it's to do with Tasmania's convict past: that there were so many men cooped up for so long that the convict era came to be associated with homosexuality and so there was a shame associated with the convict past."" Whatever the cause of the shift in public thinking, Croome is convinced that if the bill passes into law, ""it will be an historic moment."" For Moore it would be a deeply personal affirmation to know that ""even in our own conscience, we are equal to others."" And for his partner, it would be the moment Australia comes of age, tipping its hat to equal rights for all Australian -- religious or otherwise. ""The important point in this debate is that some people are consumed with the church's beliefs,"" he said. ""But we live in a secular society. I grew up in a Catholic family, my mum still attends church and she's a supporter of marriage equality, as are my godparents."" Whether via state by state stealth or an amendment to the Federal Marriage Act, as Rodney Croome puts it: ""There will be a lot of gay people who are married -- and they will remain married."" The Federal Parliament in the meantime is readying to vote on changes to the Marriage Act to allow same sex marriage. With only the ruling Labor party permitting its members a conscience vote, the chance of change is miniscule.","Tasmanian Parliament will introduce the Same-Sex Marriage Bill this week .

"Editor's note: Peter Bregman is chief executive of Bregman Partners Inc., a global management consulting firm, and the author of ""Point B: A Short Guide to Leading a Big Change"". He writes a weekly column, How We Work, for HarvardBusiness.org. Peter Bregman says Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett shared their humanity with us. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Last Thursday my wife, Eleanor, flew to Houston, Texas, to see her grandmother, Nana, who had just suffered a debilitating stroke. Nana is 93 years old with few friends left. As she lay in a hospital bed barely able to speak, family members gathered around her to tell her they love her and to say goodbye. Saying goodbye to a loved one is an intensely personal and emotional moment. The memories of time spent together linger as we feel the love, the sadness, the loss. The same day Eleanor gathered with her family, people around the world gathered -- in person and online -- to say goodbye to two outsized public figures to whom they felt connected: Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett. Michael Jackson brought us closer to life itself. We sang with him, danced with him and were amazed by his youthful exuberance and musical talent. He was the original; I still remember watching ""Billie Jean"" on MTV thinking, ""Maybe there is something to this music video thing."" He sold over 800 million albums and ""Thriller"" is still the No. 1 selling album of all time. He was a young man with extraordinary talent. We loved him as a young man because he remained real, with his personality shining through his music. But then something happened. As he grew up, he grew away. From himself and from us. We lost touch with his humanness, his personality, his vulnerability. And when we couldn't see that, we couldn't see him. A few years ago, Anthony Robbins, a motivational speaker who teaches about success in relationships, got divorced. People wondered if this would be the end of his career. Would his audiences abandon him when they found out? After all, how good was his advice if he couldn't hold together his own marriage? But when he spoke publicly about his divorce, people were amazingly supportive of him. The divorce, his failures, his vulnerabilities, didn't diminish him. They made him human. We can't identify with perfection. We can admire it from afar, maybe aspire to it. But we can't relate to it because we know, deep down, that we ourselves are flawed. So we trust others who recognize that about themselves, too. Michael Jackson's tragedy was the second half of his life -- when he hid behind surgery and the high walls of Neverland. Of course, trying to cover up his vulnerability was itself a vulnerability. But, in hiding, he lost himself. And so we lost him, too. That is the exact opposite of what Farrah Fawcett did. In the depths of a horrible, potentially embarrassing illness, Farrah Fawcett came out of hiding. When most of us would shoo the cameras away, she invited us in. She let us see her pain and suffering and fear and sadness. She let us see her self. So many of us fell in love with her all over again. Not for her youthful beauty or her perfection or because she represented some ideal to which we aspired. No, we fell in love with her because we saw the real her. The raw, uncut, painful her. And in her, we saw ourselves. We fell in love with her because we identified with her. Farrah's youthful beauty transformed through illness and suffering is a dark reminder of the inevitable progression of life, a reminder that we usually try to avoid. She herself tried to avoid aging for a while, with face-lifts and botox. And in her pursuit to retain her perfection, she began to lose us. But then she got real and reached out and we reached back. We reached back because of her vulnerability, not despite it. Between my starting this article and finishing the final draft, Eleanor's grandmother Nana died. Death is one of the few times in life when something is irrevocably taken from us. It's impossible to go back and relive the period of our lives when she was with us, when she was younger, when we were younger. Time moves only in one direction. And with her passing we are reminded of a time that has passed in our own lives, of moments we will never relive. It's a little bit like that with Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett. We feel something deep for them too. Because they, too, touched our lives and changed us. They inspired us, excited us, empowered us. They lived with us. And with their passing, we are reminded of a part of our lives that is gone forever. Both Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett caught our attention because of their particular gifts. But we care about them as people because they let us in, because they were human, real. It's their vulnerability in the context of their power that was so impossible to resist, so compelling, so moving. That's what Michael Jackson had and lost. And it's what Farrah Fawcett lost and found. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bregman.","Bregman: Deaths of Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett touched many deeply .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The Obama administration will work to stop any ""illicit"" nuclear aspirations by Iran, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the U.S. will try to end Iran's ""support for terrorism."" Rice spoke briefly about Iran in her speech, which was primarily focused on the Obama administration's approach to Iraq and its people. She called on the international community to provide greater support to the millions of Iraqi refugees who have been displaced because of the war. Her comments on Iran came toward the end of her speech, when she mentioned that the United States plans to pursue a ""comprehensive strategy"" in the Middle East, including relations with Syria, Israel and the Palestinian people. The United States ""will seek to end Iran's ambition to acquire an illicit nuclear capability and its support for terrorism,"" Rice said. President Barack Obama  has said the United States is looking for opportunities for ""face to face"" dialogue with Iran, though he has ""deep concerns"" about Tehran's actions. ""We are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun. For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America,"" Obama said Tuesday during his first speech to a joint session of Congress. ""We cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm. We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand."" President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said his country welcomes talks with the United States ""in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect."" In response to Rice's speech, Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Mohammad Khazaee, sent a letter to the president of the Security Council, Yukio Takasu, defending Iran's nuclear program and challenging U.S. allegations about the program. ""It is unfortunate that, yet again, we are hearing the same tired, unwarranted and groundless allegations that used to be unjustifiably and futilely repeated by the previous U.S. administration,"" Khazaee wrote. Iran has repeatedly said, and the letter echoed, that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and the country has not and will not seek to acquire nuclear weapons. The letter also called U.S. allegations against Iran on terrorism ""equally baseless and absurd."" Iran tested its first nuclear power plant on Wednesday at the Bushehr nuclear power plant using ""dummy"" fuel rods. Officials said the next test will use enriched uranium, but it is not clear when the test will be held or when the facility will be fully operational. Last week, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report stating that Iran has reached ""nuclear weapons breakout capability"" -- it has enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The report was based on an analysis of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency. However, an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data, saying Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material. That hasn't been done, the official said. CNN's Katy Byron contributed to this report.","Susan Rice says U.S. plans to pursue a ""comprehensive strategy"" in Middle East .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The death toll from Thursday's earthquake in southwest China is at least 25, with more than 250 injured, according to the ministry of civil affairs. The 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit near the border with Myanmar, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It collapsed houses in the remote Yingjiang county in Yunnan province, according to a county official who would provide only his surname, Ke -- a common practice among officials. State media said the quake hit the area shortly before 1 p.m. local time, cutting power and toppling buildings including hotels and schools. The epicenter was 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the center of Yingjiang county, which has a population of more than 270,000 and is home to several of China's ethnic minorities. China Central Television showed damaged buildings with debris and red lanterns lying around as police officers directed traffic on a chaotic street. Aftershocks continued to jolt the area as firefighters and other rescuers helped free those trapped, Li Zhiren, the deputy county chief told CCTV. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed condolences on behalf of the Obama administration. ""As people in Yunnan province mourn the loss of life and work to save those that are injured and trapped in the rubble, our thoughts are with the injured, the families of the victims, and with all the people of China,"" she said. The area has experienced minor quakes under 5.0 magnitude since the year began, according to the Xinhua news agency. As of Thursday, the local seismological bureau had recorded more than 1,200 such tremors, Xinhua said.

"(CNN) -- More patients will soon be told that they received potentially contaminated drugs from the New England Compounding Center, whose products are associated with 308 illnesses and 23 deaths. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration posted on its website a list of more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics that had purchased steroids and other drugs from the compounding center that, if contaminated, would be especially dangerous for patients. The agency took the list down after it realized it wasn't accurate. ""FDA has found some technical problems with the list and the data are incorrect,"" according to a statement on the agency's website. ""FDA is working to correct the list and will re-post when we are sure it is accurate."" A ""few"" drugs are of concern, according to FDA spokeswoman Sarah Clark-Lynn. They include triamcinolone acetonide, an injectable steroid used to treat pain; injectable drugs used for eye surgery; and cardioplegic solutions, which are used during open heart surgeries. This month, dozens of hospitals were contacted about the potential danger of another injectable steroid, methylprednisolone, which is used to treat pain. The FDA warns patients who received any of these drugs to be vigilant for signs of fungal meningitis, such as headache and fever. On Tuesday, the New England Compounding Center's chief pharmacist surrendered his license to the Tennessee Pharmacy Board. Dr. Barry Cadden no longer has a license to operate in Tennessee, according to board spokesman Bill Christian. Tennessee has been the hardest-hit state in the meningitis outbreak, with 70 cases as of Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility Tuesday for a deadly attack in Punjab province. At least 24 people -- mostly civilians -- were killed and 105 others were wounded when a bomb went off at a compressed natural gas station Tuesday, officials said. Tahir Hussain, commissioner of Faisalabad -- where the blast occurred -- called it an act of terrorism. Ihsanullah Ihsan, spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, told CNN the target was the regional office of Pakistan's top spy agency, the ISI. The intelligence agency building experienced no major damage, said Naseem Sadiq, a senior government official in Faisalabad. Among the dead were an intelligence officer and a schoolteacher, Sadiq said. Some people were trapped under the rubble but rescuers managed to get them out, officials said. A large crater at the blast site suggested the explosion was caused by a device planted at the pump, said Hussain.  When it went off, it triggered a second explosion at the gas station, he said. Ihsan said the ISI had killed many Taliban fighters over the years and had handed over some to the United States in return for money. He warned that his group will continue to target the ISI in revenge. Pakistan has the highest number of vehicles running on compressed natural gas (CNG) as well as the most refueling stations in the world, according to December 2009 figures from the International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles. The New Zealand-based trade group placed the number of CNG stations in Pakistan at 3,068. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report .","NEW: The death toll rises to 24 .

"(CNN) -- A runaway teen who said her father threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity has been returned from Florida to Ohio, but not yet to her family, her mother's lawyer said Tuesday. Rifqa Bary, 17, is in the custody of Franklin County Children Services while other issues in the case are settled, attorney Roger Weeden said. ""We're very happy that Rifqa is back where she should be, close to her parents,"" Weeden said. ""The allegations of abuse and neglect were unfounded. Now some unification can begin."" A Florida judge ruled earlier this month in favor of her parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, who had requested that their daughter be transferred to Ohio. The teen's attorney, John Stemberger, who leads a Christian advocacy organization, opposed the move. The teen left her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July and took refuge in the home of a minister in Orlando, Florida. She was later moved into foster care after she said in an affidavit that her Muslim father had threatened her after finding out about her conversion. Her father has denied the allegation. Judge Daniel Dawson, in his October 13 decision, said it was in Bary's best interest for her emergency custody case to continue in Ohio. The transfer was delayed until the teen's immigration status was determined. Attorneys for the parents, who are from Sri Lanka, sent her immigration documents to the court within two weeks. Her return to Ohio comes after months of legal wrangling, including the affidavit from the teenager claiming that her father was pressured by the family's mosque in Ohio to ""deal with the situation,"" referring to her conversion. In an earlier court filing, Rifqa Bary alleged that her father said, ""If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me."" The teenager claims her father added, ""I will kill you."" Mohamed Bary, 47, has denied the accusations. ""We wouldn't do her harm,"" he said, saying he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations. ""I have no problem with her practicing any faith,"" Bary said, but acknowledged that he prefers that she practice Islam. A report by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement says, ""Our investigation has provided no clear evidence of criminal activity."" During a Florida court hearing, the teen periodically read a Bible, as did many of her supporters who filled the courtroom. The supporters said they were disappointed by the ruling, but believe Jesus is with Bary no matter where she goes. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Rifqa Bary has returned to Ohio, but she is not back with her family, lawyer says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Autopsy results released Friday revealed that Ryan Brunn, the Georgia man who this week admitted murdering a 7-year-old girl, committed suicide by hanging himself in a prison cell, a state agency said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, in a news release, said the autopsy indicated that Brunn died of ""ligature hanging and the manner of death (was) suicide."" The 20-year-old hung himself with his sweatshirt, investigators determined. A medical examiner didn't find any ""other significant trauma on Brunn's body."" ""The ongoing investigation by agents ... has not uncovered any evidence to indicate Brunn's death was anything other than a suicide,"" the state investigative bureau said. Georgia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Kristen Stancil had said that Brunn was found unresponsive at 4:15 p.m. Thursday in his cell at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, and was pronounced dead at a hospital at 5:37 p.m. In a Cherokee County courthouse on Tuesday, Brunn pleaded guilty to a charge of murder in the death of young Jorelys Rivera in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta. He was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole, avoiding a potential death sentence by lethal injection. A maintenance worker at the same apartment complex where the girl lived, Brunn said in court that he devised a plan to lure Jorelys -- whom he said he'd never talked to before -- after he found one of her skates. On December 2, 2011, Brunn took a picture of the skate and approached the girl with it, asking if the skate was hers. She said yes, and Brunn promised to take her to it. Instead, he took her to an empty apartment and instructed Jorelys to pull down her pants. He then put tape over her face and cut her throat with a razor. At this point, she was still alive, he told the court. Brunn said that he then took Jorelys to the bathroom and beat her to death with the skate. He said he did not have sex with the girl. The girl's mangled body was found in a trash compactor three days after she went missing. Two days later, Brunn was arrested. He was eventually indicted on 13 counts including murder, aggravated assault, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and more. ""I'd like to apologize for everything I've done, and I do deserve everything that you're about to give me,"" he said Tuesday in court. Jorelys' father, Ricardo Galarza, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Thursday that news of Brunn's death partly made him ""feel good but, on the other hand, it doesn't because my daughter will never be with me again."" ""What I wanted was for them to put him in the electric chair and burn him,"" Galarza said. ""I would have taken him there myself and prepared it, so he would burn."" Canton Police Chief Jeff Lance ""stepped down"" on Thursday after an audit probing his department's handling of the case, police department spokeswoman Candy Worth told CNN on Friday. The interim chief is Todd VandeZande, she and the police department's website indicated. The audit is dated January 12 and was conducted by Louis Dekmar, police chief in LaGrange, Georgia, and president of the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. Dekmar determined in the audit that Canton police violated their own policies and accepted practices. He further contended that there was a ""clear absence of leadership by the agency head."" Dekmar concluded that, by the time Jorelys was reported missing, she was most likely dead and it was unlikely police could have saved her. But he added that if Canton police take similar action in future cases they may ""indeed miss an opportunity to save a victim's life.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force has released new guidelines for obesity screening and healthy lifestyle counseling. Can you explain them and give us your opinion? In its latest recommendations, the task force suggests that all physicians screen for obesity -- defined as having a body-mass index of 30 or greater -- and direct obese patients to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. In my opinion, this is in important recommendation, because research shows that the majority of primary care physicians do not adequately address obesity in their patients. This is probably because they feel that they do not have the tools to assist patients in losing weight and may be somewhat disheartened by disappointing long-term outcomes in widely publicized intensive behavioral interventions. For instance, in one of the largest trials, the Diabetes Prevention Program trial, weight loss maintenance for those in intensive behavioral counseling did not differ after 10 years from the placebo group. However, the treatment group still showed a 34% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes, even better than the group treated with a medication that reduces the risk of diabetes. This suggests that intensive lifestyle counseling can have significant benefits beyond just weight loss, which is often challenging in the long term. Physicians need to communicate to their patients the impact of even a 5% weight loss on health and disease risk reduction. In addition, they should become familiar with programs in their communities that provide the necessary multicomponent behavior intervention and support and encourage their patients throughout the process. Many insurance companies, and even Medicare, are now providing coverage for weight loss and wellness programs, so the financial aspect of referring a patient should be less of a factor than it has been in the past. Physicians may even effectively integrate weight loss programs into their practices. The Think Health! study, published in the June edition of the journal Obesity, found clinically significant weight loss in attendees of a moderate-intensity, primary care practice weight-management program. The second recommendation from the task force is a bit confusing and less useful, in my opinion. The task force says, ""Clinicians should selectively provide behavioral counseling in the primary care setting to promote a healthful diet and physical activity rather than incorporating it into the care of all adults in the general population."" They note that medium-to-high-intensity behavioral counseling provides small improvements in cardiovascular risk factors but that these are generally not provided by the primary care physician. They suggest that physicians provide this type of counseling in select patients after evaluation of readiness for change, other cardiac risk factors, community support and other priorities. In my opinion, the average primary care physician does not have the time or training to provide such counseling or even to fully evaluate and determine which patients will potentially benefit. I think doctors should address the risk factors, educate all patients briefly about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and cardiovascular risk reduction, and provide basic literature about strategies to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Even if the patient is not ready for change, an initial discussion is warranted with everyone, in my opinion, and may lead to positive lifestyle change. More intense intervention -- when appropriate and when the patient is willing -- should come from trained auxiliary staff, a registered dietician or community-based programs targeting behavior change. The physician should play an active role in following up and promoting behavioral change, but unfortunately I don't think our current medical system would support a more intense, time-consuming physician intervention. The broader public health interventions they mention in their statement could certainly be beneficial, but I believe that more personalized, community-based, economically sensitive sessions delivered in an individual or group format would be more effective.

"(CNN) -- For most of Paul Ramirez's life, only those closest to him knew that he lived with a serious brain disorder. Ramirez, of Pasadena, California, found out he had epilepsy when he was 22. Now 50, he's had seven grand mal seizures, which make him lose consciousness. Still, he often went years without having a seizure at all. ""I kept it private from extended members of my family. I never told my friends. I was ashamed of it,"" Ramirez said. That changed in June. Ramirez was waiting to see his neurologist after a recent seizure. The doctor would help determine whether Ramirez should continue driving. In the waiting room, Ramirez stumbled across a CNN.com story on his iPad. The story, published after U.S. Commerce Secretary John Bryson had a seizure while driving, explained how common seizures are and the reasons they can occur. It featured people living with epilepsy who talked about the impact the disorder had on their lives. Reading the piece marked a turning point in Ramirez's life. ""It was the first time I had ever read a story that actually mirrored my own life,"" he said. ""It was inspiring. It was encouraging. It gave me hope that there were others out there (like me)."" Ramirez immediately sent an e-mail to Nathan Jones, who was featured in the story. By the time the doctor appointment was over, Jones had responded. Ramirez and Jones, project coordinator at the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Los Angeles, soon became fast friends, sharing stories over coffee and lunch. A week later, Ramirez went to the foundation's office and met with the staff. He wrote an e-mail to his family and friends, telling them about his journey and his struggles with epilepsy. He also told them the Department of Motor Vehicles was looking into whether he should keep his license. He was overwhelmed with support. ""I now feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,"" he said. ""I'm not afraid to come forward, to discuss it."" Ramirez realized that he had an opportunity to share his story and to help others. He signed up to become a team captain for the foundation's Walk to End Epilepsy on October 28 at the Rose Bowl. Then he decided to do more. Last month, days before his 50th birthday, Ramirez climbed Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States, in one 15-hour hike. He dedicated that hike and his birthday to raising money for the walk. When he reached the summit, Ramirez put on a shirt with two simple words: End Epilepsy.

"(CNN) -- A police motorcyclist in President Barack Obama's motorcade died Sunday in Florida following a serious highway accident, police and the top White House spokesman said. The officer from the Jupiter, Florida, police department was transported around 4:40 p.m. to St. Mary's Medical Center in nearby West Palm Beach after being critically injured in a crash. The man -- identified as Officer Bruce St. Laurent -- later died at the hospital, Jupiter police Chief Frank Kitzerow told reporters late Sunday. Obama was notified of the death, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters after Air Force One landed in Washington. The president's thoughts and prayers are with the officer's family, according to the spokesman. The Jupiter officer was traveling along I-95 through West Palm Beach when a Ford 150 pickup hit his motorcycle, West Palm Beach Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Therese Barbera told CNN. The crash happened near the front of the president's motorcade, and Obama himself did not see it unfold, according to Carney. The White House spokesman said no other vehicles from the motorcade were involved. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office is investigating the accident, with assistance from the Florida Highway Patrol, said Kitzerow from the Jupiter police. These authorities were investigating the crash as a vehicular homicide, said Barbera, who stressed it still very early in the probe. The Palm Beach Gardens and West Palm Beach police departments were also assisting on the case, including helping deal with arrangements for the officer and supporting the police force in Jupiter, according to Kitzerow. St. Laurent was a 20-year veteran of Jupiter's police department, including 18 years as a motor officer, his chief said. The late officer's family has been told about his death, Kitzerow added. CNN's Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: The late officer was a 20-year veteran of the Jupiter police department, its chief says .

"Ajdabiya, Libya (CNN) -- Outside the Libyan city of Ajdabiya, tents have sprouted in the rolling desert, where the sands blow and farmers grow figs and grapes. In the city, a fierce fight rages for control between the Libyan opposition and forces loyal to strongman Moammar Gadhafi, whose tanks lob shells to push their foes back. At night, coalition planes roar overhead, pounding Gadhafi's positions. Early Friday, British jets pounded Libyan armored vehicles. But they have not been able to stop the battle on the ground, and residents are escaping to safer ground. ""I couldn't even begin to describe to you the horror that I have seen,"" one man said. ""Leaving Ajdabiya, we saw dead bodies in the street. No one would ever dare go to recover them."" He fled his hometown with his six children this week. One of his sons, maybe about 10, cradles his head as his father talks. He cries quietly. Other children gather around. When an oil tanker barrels down the road, they freeze and then scatter in fear. The people here have nothing: no change of clothes, not even water. They sleep on thin sheets of plastic and think they will keep themselves warm at night with firewood in a tin box that is only 1 foot in diameter. They keep hoping that when the next morning comes, they will be able to trek back through the barren land to their homes. But every morning brings more of the same. Two trucks arrive from Benghazi to the north. They bring rice, sugar, powdered milk for babies. The people say the aid materialized from the goodwill of their compatriots in Benghazi. Relief, however little. As the Libyan war goes on, humanitarian agencies report increasing numbers of Libyans displaced from their homes. The International Medical Corps estimates that 20,000 people have taken refuge in a small town east of Ajdabiya. The Libyan Red Crescent says another 5,000 are displaced in the coastal town of Derna. The United Nations refugee agency says it has sent two medical convoys to Benghazi and also shipments of blankets, sleeping mats and other basic items. But delivering aid is an issue. The agency does not have access to places other than Benghazi, the nation's second-largest city that is in the hands of the opposition. Reports like these are not uncommon in war. For its victims, life's only focus becomes survival. One man says Gadhafi's tanks roared down Ajdabiya's streets, firing into houses. What choice did they have but to flee? He says the troops were searching house to house. They took away five young men from his neighbor's place. He doesn't know what happened to them or whether he will ever see them again.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Between 20 and 25 employees of NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" have been laid off and host Jay Leno has taken a substantial pay cut, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN on Saturday. The employees were let go Friday, with Leno's salary reduction intended to prevent even more staff reductions, the source said. The actions were taken as NBC seeks to move the show to a cost structure typical of late-night programming, as opposed to prime-time shows, according to the source. Leno replaced the legendary Johnny Carson as host of ""The Tonight Show"" in 1992, a job he held for 17 years when he left in 2009 to helm ""The Jay Leno Show"" with a 10 p.m. start time. But a few months later, in January 2010, NBC announced the comedian would once again move to his old 11:35 p.m. time slot. The Massachusetts-raised comic's venture into prime time three years ago was pitched as an attempt by the network to parlay his proven popularity into a commercially successful show. But lagging ratings prompted NBC executives to change course within a few months. That move ultimately led to fellow talk show host Conan O'Brien's departure from the network. O'Brien now hosts a show, ""Conan,"" on TBS that, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner. 300,000 education jobs lost . Need a job?

"(CNN) -- George McGovern rode the swirling social and political currents of America in the late 1960s and early 1970s to lead a political movement that permanently changed the nation in ways that we still do not fully understand. A mild-mannered Midwestern intellectual, World War II combat hero and son of a Methodist minister, he became the leading edge of a storm promising (or threatening, depending on your point of view) transformative change on a wide range of issues including foreign policy, the electoral process and the rights of women. It was a storm that gathered intense support and equally intense opposition in the senator's run for president against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. While the nation's younger and more highly educated rallied to McGovern's standard, the ""silent majority"" were deeply troubled by much of what they believed to be the McGovern agenda. George McGovern, an unabashed liberal voice, dies . Ultimately, much of what George McGovern campaigned for in 1972 came to pass. Both major political parties have a system of nominating a president that is far more transparent, accountable and democratic than the systems that existed prior to 1972. McGovern was instrumental in rewriting the rules for selecting Democratic convention delegates to include women, minorities and young people. (Women, minorities and gays now have far more rights and protections than they did in 1972.) But the cutting edge of the 1972 campaign was about how America dealt with the rest of the world, how it chose and challenged its adversaries, and in particular, how it would resolve the Vietnam War. By gaining the Democratic nomination, McGovern became the leading opponent of the war; he challenged the usefulness of the 25-year strategy of containing the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and any other nation committed to or influenced by Communism. McGovern and many other political leaders in both parties argued that in opposing Communism or other types of totalitarianism, the U.S. had to be far more strategic -- that fighting in places like Vietnam, where the outcome would have little real consequence on our nation's global struggle against a failed ideology, squandered American lives and treasure. Greene: McGovern a strong man who overcame defeat . While the Nixon administration and conservative Republicans lambasted McGovern for those views, Nixon eventually signed a peace agreement that ended the war on terms no more favorable than would have been granted had the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment been adopted in 1970 -- an amendment that proposed a complete withdrawal of troops from Vietnam and would have saved thousands of American combat casualties. Here is part of the passionate speech -- bracingly relevant today -- that McGovern delivered on the Senate floor before the vote defeating the amendment: . ""Every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. This chamber reeks of blood. Every senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval and all across our land â€” young men without legs, or arms, or genitals, or faces or hopes. ""There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed. But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes. And if we do not end this damnable war, those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the executive carry the burden that the Constitution places on us. ""So before we vote, let us ponder the admonition of Edmund Burke, the great parliamentarian of an earlier day: 'A contentious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood.'"" Highlights of George McGovern's life . Today, American businesses are seeking to broaden our commercial relationships with Vietnam, and American military advisers meet with the Vietnamese to suggest strategies that will help that country protect the territory it claims in the South China Sea from possible Chinese aggression. George McGovern never fully recovered from the drubbing he received at the polls in November of 1972. But the path that he pointed to was ultimately the path the country took, and the movement he founded drew thousands of men and women, who committed their lives to public service and who continue to contribute to their communities and their country 40 years later. George McGovern was never the extremist his opponents tried to characterize him as being. His subsequent electoral success in South Dakota was evidence enough of that fact. But he was a man of great vision and grace. He helped to educate a generation about the failures of a rigid and untextured accounting of our allies and our enemies, and about the importance of making smart choices when dealing with dangerous adversaries. Those are lessons as important today as they were in 1970. Politicians pay tribute . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Lilly.","Scott Lilly: McGovern presciently rode swirling political, social currents of late '60s, early '70s .
His views on foreign policy, women's rights and more drew support of young, Lilly says .

"(CNN) -- An attorney for Drew Peterson, a former Chicago-area police sergeant accused of killing his ex-wife, said Tuesday the prosecution failed to even prove a murder took place. Prosecutors said that common sense would lead a jury to a guilty verdict. Peterson's fate will be deliberated beginning Wednesday morning, after the attorneys in the case that has attracted nationwide attention wrapped up their closing arguments. Peterson trial focuses on alleged threat to kill his wife . Peterson, 58, is charged with murder in the death of Kathleen Savio, his third wife, who was found dead in her dry, clean bathtub March 1, 2004. Prosecutor Chris Koch called on the jurors to use their own experiences in life when determining guilt or innocence. ""I ask you to keep in mind common sense, common sense. Because it is clear that this man murdered Kathleen Savio,"" Koch said. Peterson has pleaded not guilty to two charges of first degree murder, one by intentionally killing her and the other by engaging in behavior that led to her death. The defense contends Savio fell accidentally, hit her head and drowned. Defense attorney Joe Lopez said that 300 people each year die in bathtub mishaps. ""People slip and have household accidents all the time ... at least 1.6 people out of a million die in the bathtub,"" he said. ""And she was the one. And they want to make it a murder."" Koch said in closing that the evidence pointed to murder. ""We have left-front injuries, left-side injuries, left-back injuries, right injuries, right and left injuries. So it's not just one side of her body; it's multiple sides, four sides. How can you get that in one fall? You can't. You can't do it. It's not possible,"" Koch said. Lopez countered by saying the prosecution failed to prove its case. ""The framers of the Constitution would barf at this evidence,"" he told the jury. ""There's nothing but doubt in this case. People get on the TV and lie, just like they do in this courtroom. ... People lie when it's for their own agenda."" After court adjourned for the day, Lopez told reporters: ""They haven't even proved a homicide took place."" The case did not arise until after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, went missing in October 2007. It was during the search for Stacy Peterson, who has not been found, that investigators said they would look again at Savio's death, which was initially ruled a drowning. Savio's death was ruled a homicide in February 2008, and Peterson was later arrested and indicted on first-degree murder. Judge refuses to declare mistrial for Drew Peterson . Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, who later became his fourth wife. Savio and Peterson filed for divorce in October 2001 and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Bolingbrook police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. On February 27, 2004, Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home and spent the next two days with them. Prosecutors believe he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed her. At the time of her death, which authorities initially treated as an accident, a court was mulling how the couple's marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. The monthlong trial has been marked by repeated missteps by the prosecution that have angered Judge Edward Burmila and the defense. At least four times since the trial began, prosecutors have allowed witnesses to testify to details Burmila has told them not to go into -- such as whether Savio had a protective order against her husband or allowing a witness to demonstrate climbing into a bathtub. In some cases the defense has sought a mistrial and in others they have asked the judge to strike entire testimony. Burmila has instead ordered the jury to disregard elements of the testimony that went against his orders. ""The disrespect to the court is shocking,"" Burmila told the prosecution last week. After closing arguments, jury deliberation could start as early as Tuesday afternoon. Drew Peterson goes on trial for murder of third wife .

"(CNN) -- In April 2007, UEFA's executive committee voted to accept a joint proposal from Poland and Ukraine to host the European football Championships in 2012. Poland faces a struggle to upgrade many of its venues, such as Tenth Anniversary stadium in Warsaw. The decision to award the tournament to Poland -- a former communist country -- and Ukraine -- a former Soviet Republic -- was viewed with surprise by many in the world of sport as they had defeated a rival bid from established football powerhouse Italy. In addition to providing economic benefits -- hosting Euro 2008 was worth over $450 million to the Austrian economy according to its government -- staging such a high-profile international event would cap their remarkable transformation into credible democracies in the eyes of the world. However, both countries have had to address a number of problems.  Watch more about Poland's bid » . Political instability remains an issue in Ukraine -- the fragile ruling coalition recently collapsed -- while Poland's national team narrowly avoided a suspension after football's world ruling body FIFA said its federation had done little to stamp out corruption. A match-fixing scandal in the domestic league in 2005 led to about 70 people being arrested, though no one has been prosecuted. Significantly, neither country has hosted a major sporting event and concerns remain about the shortage of adequate stadiums, high-quality hotels and poor transport infrastructure in both Poland and Ukraine. With the proposed semi-final venues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk and the Polish capital Warsaw, fans would currently be faced with a 30-hour train journey to attend both games. Although there are plans to expand and improve the highway linking the nations. The opening match is scheduled to be staged at a new 70,000-capacity National Stadium in Warsaw when construction work is completed in 2009 at a cost of $800 million. The final will be held at Kiev's redeveloped Olympic Stadium, however all 12 proposed venues need considerable work in order to comply with international standards. The remaining games will be held in the Polish cities of Gdansk, Poznan, Wroclaw, Chorzow and Krakow, as well as the Ukrainian cities of Lviv and Dnipropetrovsk. Concerns about the readiness of the co-hosts led to a warning in June this year from UEFA President Michel Platini that they risked losing the right to stage the tournament if stadiums in their capitals were not ready. This prompted a defiant response from the prime minister of Poland, who vowed to prove the skeptics wrong and make the 2012 European Championship an organizational triumph. ""We are aware that there are countries interested in us failing and the only successful rebuke to that will be better coordination and solidarity in our actions,"" Polish premier Donald Tusk told reporters at the time. Bizarrely, the head of Poland's Football Association, Michal Listkiewicz, offered Uefa an alternative option for 2012 after voicing his concerns about Poland's ability to overcome its transport issues. ""If the European Championships took place in 2016, we would have no problems about being ready then,"" Listkiewicz told Germany's Die Zeit Online. ""But realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012,"" he said. ""From Gdansk (in Poland) to Donetsk (in the Ukraine) is more than 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). This is not like in Austria and Switzerland where everything lies close together."" Both countries were given a partial reprieve in September this year after UEFA's executive committee met in Bordeaux to discuss a progress report on preparations for the tournament. ""The executive committee reconfirmed UEFA's commitment to organize Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine,"" Platini told uefa.com. ""At the same time, the committee stressed a number of conditions must be met in order to bring forward the whole project."" ""If we don't have the stadiums in Kiev and Warsaw, that's a problem. Ukraine can't afford to send everyone to a country where there is no capital city (ready),'' Platini said. ""They are working very hard and we have confidence in them. The president and the prime minister tell me it will be ready. What am I supposed to say? That I don't believe them?'' He added that the committee would review the progress again in May 2009. UEFA will then confirm the cities that will host matches. Meanwhile, the Scottish FA has offered to step in to host the tournament if UEFA decides to look elsewhere. Failure to host Euro 2012 is not an option in both Kiev and Warsaw. It would be viewed as a national embarrassment.","Doubts persist about Poland and Ukraine's ability to stage tournament in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Record-holder Paula Radcliffe stepped up her bid to run in the marathon at the world athletics championships next Sunday with victory on her competitive return to action. Marathon record-holder Paula Radcliffe is seeking to win back her world title in Berlin. The British runner, who is hoping to win back the title she won the last time she competed at the event in Helsinki in 2005, triumphed in the New York City half-marathon for the third time on Sunday morning. It was the 35-year-old's first race since winning the full marathon in the same city nine months ago, having since been sidelined by a foot operation. She was due to fly to Germany following the race to discuss her fitness with UK Athletics head coach Charles van Commenee and make a decision about whether she will race in Berlin. ""I don't know. I came through the race and that was the main objective and everything felt good. We will see how I recover over the next few days,"" she told reporters. ""It is definitely more likely than it was this time last week. It's good to get out and race and feel good in the race. It's definitely done me good, now I just have to decide if I have the strength and (training) background behind me to race with the people in the race next week."" Radcliffe missed the 2007 world championships after falling pregnant with her first child, and then suffering back problems. She battled to be fit for the Beijing Olympics after breaking her leg, but could finish only 23rd as she suffered from cramp. However, New York has once again proved to be one of her favorite race venues, and she won the half-marathon easily in a time of one hour, nine minutes and 45 seconds - just two seconds outside the record set in its inaugural staging in 2006 by Catherine Ndereba of Kenya. Radcliffe broke clear of Mamitu Daska just before the eight-mile mark, with the Ethiopian finishing the 13.1-mile event in second place and Ndereba third. ""I normally want to run as hard as I can but today was more about blowing away the cobwebs so it was not the fastest time I have ever run,"" Radcliffe said. ""It's hard to get into a race knowing you are deliberately conserving something for next week. I felt pretty good in Central Park and tried to keep relaxed. I felt the humidity a bit and the headwind in the last four or five miles. ""I would have been happier to run a minute or so quicker but I felt pretty good afterwards.""

"(CNN) -- One of the most sensational and infamous murder cases in modern U.S. history returned to a courtroom Monday as former Green Beret doctor Jeffrey MacDonald sought a new trial in the killing of his family. MacDonald was back in court in Wilmington, North Carolina, as his lawyers argued new evidence should be heard by a jury. ""We feel like evidence is coming in the way we want it to. So we are very pleased at this point,"" MacDonald lawyer Gordon Widenhouse told CNN affilliate News 14 Carolina. MacDonald is serving a life sentence in the 1970 slayings of his wife and two young daughters in their Fort Bragg home. The 68-year-old has long maintained that they were beaten and stabbed to death by a group of hippies who broke into their homes, chanting ""kill the pigs"" and ""acid's groovy."" MacDonald and his lawyers contend that DNA tests show that hair samples found underneath the fingernail of one of the victims did not come from a member of the MacDonald family and presumably were from one of the killers. The defense will also try to prove that the prosecutor in the criminal trial threatened Helena Stoeckley, a witness who had earlier confessed to being in the MacDonald home the night of the murders. MacDonald told investigators that he was at home, sleeping on a couch, when he heard screaming. He awoke to find three men and one woman, whom he described as having blond hair and wearing a floppy hat. He was found with two stab wounds and a collapsed lung. While an Army inquiry into the murders recommended that MacDonald not be court-martialed, a civilian federal jury found him guilty in 1979. He has been behind bars since 1982. But in 2011, a federal appeals court ruled that MacDonald was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. During MacDonald's trial, Stoeckley said she was not present and had no involvement in the killings. The defense insists the prosecutor, James Blackburn, pressured Stoeckley to alter her testimony. Stoeckley, who had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse, died in 1983. Blackburn would not comment on the charge, citing Monday's hearing. ""I was the prosecutor in the case, and I did that job to the best of my ability,"" Blackburn told CNN. ""I did it in great reliance of the evidence the government had, and we presented an honorable case and it was straightforward and it was based on good and competent evidence. And I agree with the jury's verdict."" The MacDonald saga has captivated the public's attention for decades. It also became the focus of the controversial and popular book ""Fatal Vision"" by Joe McGinniss. On television, millions watched a miniseries about the case and a memorable ""60 Minutes"" interview with MacDonald. This month, Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Errol Morris spoke to CNN about ""A Wilderness of Error: The Trials of Jeffrey MacDonald,"" his new book on the subject. ""We've been sold a bill of goods about this case,"" Morris said. ""It's as phony as a three-dollar bill."" ""There are many things about this case that rub me the wrong way, but principal among them was how the jury was asked to make decisions about his guilt or innocence with incomplete evidence; evidence that was withheld, corrupted and suppressed.""

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- When I arrived in Cape Town for Desmond Tutu's 80th birthday festivities this week a customs official asked why I was visiting the country. When I explained she said ""Ah! Desmond Tutu -- he is everybody's archbishop!"" She reflected the gratitude of a world that celebrates his leadership in calling out of the best of our humanity by claiming him as part of her life. At 80 Desmond Tutu is as spunky as ever in imagining and working for a world where all are included. Tutu's insistence on our need for one another in order to be fully human is the signature idea behind his global leadership on reconciliation, ending conflicts and hope. As the world celebrates his iconic leadership it illuminates the void in authentic ethical leadership in the global community. In my first personal meeting with Tutu in 1980 I was thrown off guard by his question, ""Tell me about your life Robert - not what you've done but who you are."" The question reflects his belief in the value and sacredness of each human story and that our lives are all bundled together. I was not prepared for his reaction to my story. I was 22 and Tutu was 49 and I wondered what our lives could have in common. Telling him of my lengthy hospitalizations as a teenager I said that I'd had an unexpected visitor in Trevor Huddleston whose book ""Naught For Your Comfort"" opened my eyes to the brutal realities of apartheid. Huddleston's expansive generosity about the humanity of all stood in sharp contrast to the way in which the community he served in Sophiatown was bulldozed by the apartheid government because its multi-ethnic character did not fit the paradigm of apartheid to separate people at any cost. As I paused in the telling of my story Desmond Tutu's laughter filled the room. Incredulous, I just looked at him, waiting for him to settle down. Finally Tutu said, ""When I was a young boy, I had tuberculosis. I spent months in the hospital, just like you, lonely and afraid. Trevor Huddleston was my priest! He visited me almost every day, reading stories and talking to me. Huddleston inspired me to think about being a priest."" Shared transformation, decades apart. On the common ground of our connecting story, Tutu then asked, ""Tell me your thinking about serving in the military."" I shared with him my willingness to go to prison indefinitely as a consequence for refusing to serve in the South African military that enforced apartheid. Tutu thoughtfully said, ""There will be a time when this kind of action will be important. It isn't now."" I hadn't expected this reaction to a decision I had wrestled with for years. I had thirty days before showing up to report for military duty or else refuse to serve and be jailed. Within ten days Tutu had me out of the country and in New York City. Desmond Tutu had no reason to act as he did other than his profound sense of our shared humanity in working for a world in which justice and the wellbeing of all is an expression of his ethical leadership of compassion. Fifteen years later I asked Desmond Tutu when he would add LGBT people into his compelling vision that we are all ""made for oneness."" He assured me that it would be after the fall of apartheid. This iconic leader has been true to his word. To the ire of many and the delight of others, Tutu is insistent that there are no outsiders with God or the human family. Gender equity for women and the need to protect the environment stand alongside Tutu's voice negotiating the ending of conflicts around the globe. His vision that we are all part of one family is a global vision. In a world of increasing xenophobia and a preponderance of leaders who serve the altar of exclusionary self-interest Tutu stands out because of his view that we need one another in order to be fully human. That customs official was right -- Tutu is ""everybody's archbishop"" for a reason.","Taylor: Tutu still working for a world where all are included .

"(CNN) -- Claudio Ranieri has resigned as AS Roma coach following the Italian Serie A side blew a three-goal lead to lose 4-3 at Genoa on Sunday. The result marked a fourth consecutive defeat for the Rome-based club, who also lost to Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League earlier this week. After much speculation about Ranieri's future, AFP reported that the 59-year-old had told Italian news agency Ansa that he had quit. ""I've always thought about the good of Roma and after a game such as today's I believe it's right to give a signal. After the final whistle I went into the changing rooms to thank the team and I decided to hand in my resignation,"" the Italian reportedly said. The day had started brightly for Ranieri as he saw his team go 3-0 up within 51 minutes thanks to goals from Philippe Mexes, Nicolas Burdisso and skipper Francesco Totti. But things soon took a turn for the worst as Genoa staged a remarkable comeback scoring four goals in in 35 minutes to seal Ranieri's fate. The former Chelsea boss, who had been in charge at Roma since 2009, leaves the side in eighth place in Serie A, trailing league leaders AC Milan by 13 points and city rivals Lazio by four. Roma's president Rosella Sensi says that the club will make a decision on the coaching situation on Monday, according to AFP. ""We will act on what he's said,"" she said. Meanwhile, a late goal from substitute Alexandre Pato ensured AC Milan maintained their lead at the top of the Italian league with a 2-1 win at 10-man Chievo Verona. Brazil striker Robinho gave Massimiliano Allegri's side the lead after 25 minutes, before Switzerland's Gelson Fernandes equalized for mid-table Chievo when play resumed in the second half. Brazil's Pato then came off the bench to score the winner, just before Chievo's Slovenian defender Bostjan Cesar was given a red card for a second-bookable offence with six minutes left to play. Defending champions Inter had moved within two points of the league leaders on Saturday following victory over Cagliari, but Milan's triumph means they now have five-point cushion over their third-placed city rivals. Napoli reclaimed second place with a 1-0 win at home to Catania, the club's fourth league victory in five matches. Colombia international Juan Camilo Zuniga scored the only goal in the 25th minute to put Napoli three points off the lead, while Catania are the same distance from the relegation zone. Fourth-placed Lazio beat bottom-of-the-table Bari 1-0 at home at Rome's Stadio Olimpico thanks to an early goal from Brazilian midfielder Hernanes. Lecce kept their hopes of survival alive with a 2-0 win at home over Champions League qualification contenders Juventus, who had goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was sent off for a deliberate handball after just 12 minutes. Djamel Mesbah scored for Lecce in the first half before Andrea Bertolacci doubled the lead early in the second. Parma came from behind to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to second-from-bottom Cesena thanks to a penalty from Hernan Crespo and a late strike from substitute Rafaelle Palladino. Fifth-placed Udinese's Champions League ambitions suffered a setback as they had to settle for a 0-0 draw at home with lowly Brescia, while the game between Fiorentina and Sampdoria also finished in stalemate.","Claudio Ranieri quits AS Roma coach after Sunday's Serie A defeat at Genoa .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 800 classified U.S. military documents obtained by WikiLeaks reveal extraordinary details about the alleged terrorist activities of al Qaeda operatives captured and housed at the U.S. Navy's detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The secret documents have been made available to several news organizations, including the New York Times and the Washington Post -- and some have been published by WikiLeaks, an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information. CNN was not among the news organizations granted early access to the latest files. The documents shed light on the way detainees behaved while at Guantanamo and on how they were assessed in terms of their danger to the United States. They are intelligence assessments of nearly every one of the 779 individuals who have been held at Guantanamo since 2002, according to the Post. The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement that the documents underscore a need for an independent judicial review of the cases of those being held at Guantanamo. ""These documents are remarkable because they show just how questionable the government's basis has been for detaining hundreds of people, in some cases indefinitely, at Guantanamo,"" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project, in the statement. ""The one-sided assessments are rife with uncorroborated evidence, information obtained through torture, speculation, errors and allegations that have been proven false. ""These documents are the fruit of the original sin by which the rule of law was scrapped when Guantanamo detainees were first rounded up,"" Shamsi said. ""if the government had followed the law, it would have established a meaningful and prompt process to separate the innocent from those who are legally detainable."" The classified files described some of the detainees as being compliant while others threatened violence against guards. One stated he would fly planes into houses. They also paint in great detail a portrait of al Qaeda as it grew stronger in Afghanistan in the 1990s, prepared for the September 11 attacks and scattered in their aftermath. Among the files already published by WikiLeaks and examined by CNN is that of Ahmed Khalfan Gailani, recently convicted by a New York court of taking part in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania in 1998. The file, from 2006 when Gailani was transferred to Guantanamo, includes details of his time as a bodyguard and cook to Osama bin Laden shortly before the 9/11 attacks. Gailani is cited as telling interrogators that the al Qaeda leader had a ""normal diet"" and usually ate with about 15 bodyguards. The document says Gailani later became one of al Qaeda's few forgers of travel documents. He also opted for training in using explosives to avoid front-line combat. A document from July 2008 profiles another bodyguard for bin Laden, Sanad Yislam al Kazimi, who stated that he ""would have been willing to die for UBL"" (the shorthand used for the al Qaeda leader). It says al Kazimi may have had knowledge of al Qaeda's nuclear and chemical programs. Al Kazimi escaped from Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 and returned to Yemen, where he continued to train for terrorist attacks, according to the document. He was arrested in 2002 after being lured to Dubai while planning an attack on Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates. It adds that while at Guantanamo, al Kazimi made ""numerous threats against U.S. personnel including the President."" Al Kazimi reportedly said ""he would like to tell his friends in Iraq to find the interrogator, slice him up, and make a shwarma (a type of sandwich) out of him, with the interrogator's head sticking out of the end of the shwarma."" Another Yemeni, Abdu Ali Sharqawi, is described as a ""senior al Qaeda facilitator"" with links to the 9/11 plotters. He was allegedly responsible for arranging the travel of Yemeni jihadists to Afghanistan in the 1990s, and when he also moved to Afghanistan, he became a confidant of bin Laden's. The 11-page document about his activities says that ""on occasion detainee hiked mountain trails with UBL, who hiked them on a daily basis."" Sharqawi told his interrogators that bin Laden had been in good health, even though he had one kidney. The document suggests that al Qaeda had plenty of money in the aftermath of September 11, asserting that ""detainee received and passed on over $500,000"" while helping jihadists to escape Afghanistan. According to the Washington Post, the documents provide detailed insight into Osama bin Laden's thinking and movements immediately after 9/11. ""Among other previously unknown meetings, the documents describe a major gathering of some of al Qaeda's most senior operatives in early December 2001 in Zormat, a mountainous region of Afghanistan between Kabul and Khost,"" the newspaper reports. ""There, the operatives began to plan new attacks, a process that would consume them, according to the assessments, until they were finally captured."" The documents show that detainees' accounts were extensively cross-checked against each other, with at least four detainees confirming that al Kazimi was a bodyguard to bin Laden. Among the more remarkable statements is one from a detainee who claimed that bin Laden had written to Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, before the September 11 attacks, requesting the release of al Kazimi (who'd been detained in 1995) and another man from jail. A short time later, they were freed and went to Afghanistan. The documents include substantial detail about the travel of the detainees. In one instance, a Spanish jihadist by the name of Ahmad Abd Al Rahman Ahmad, after spending time in Britain and France, is instructed to travel to Afghanistan via Iran. The document notes: ""Travel through Iran is a known modus operandi for al Qaeda operatives to get into Afghanistan via a chain of safe-houses and operatives."" According to the New York Times, the documents show that most of the 172 prisoners still held at Guantanamo have been rated as a ""high risk"" of posing a threat to the United States and its allies if released without adequate rehabilitation. But they also show that many others who have been released or transferred to other countries were also designated ""high risk,"" the newspaper says. Detainees are assessed ""high,"" ""medium"" or ""low"" in terms of their intelligence value, the threat they pose while in detention and the continued threat they might pose to the United States if released. The newspaper says the documents include details about detainees' illnesses and behavior at Guantanamo, including ""punching guards, tearing apart shower shoes, shouting across cell blocks."" But the documents appear to shed little light on interrogation tactics at Guantanamo, which have drawn widespread criticism. The New York Times says the documents lay bare ""the patchwork and contradictory evidence that in many cases would never have stood up in criminal court or a military tribunal."" The British newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, also reports that the documents suggest that much of the evidence used to detain jihadist suspects was flimsy. It says that ""people wearing a certain model of Casio watch from the 1980s were seized by American forces in Afghanistan on suspicion of being terrorists, because the watches were used as timers by al Qaeda."" Most were subsequently release for lack of evidence. Others, according to the New York Times, were not so fortunate despite a lack of evidence. One man detained in May 2003 insisted that he was a shepherd and, according to his debriefers at Guantanamo Bay, knew nothing of ""simple military and political concepts."" Yet a military tribunal declared him an ""enemy combatant"" anyway, and he was not sent home until 2006, the Times reports. ""It's not too late to change course and we need more legal process, not less, to make sure we're holding the right people,"" Shamsi said. ""The cases of the remaining Guantanamo detainees cry out for independent judicial review."" The U.S. Defense Department condemned the release of the documents, known as DABs. Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell and Ambassador Daniel Fried, the Obama administration's special envoy on detainee issues, said in a statement: ""The Guantanamo Review Task Force, established in January 2009, considered the DABs during its review of detainee information. In some cases, the Task Force came to the same conclusions as the DABs. In other instances the Review Task Force came to different conclusions, based on updated or other available information."" WikiLeaks gained international prominence after leaking thousands of papers about the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. Earlier this year it released a huge cache of secret American diplomatic papers.","NEW: The ACLU says the documents point to a need for judicial review of the cases .

"(CNN) -- They are tall, powerful and capable of serving a tennis ball at over 150 mph (241 kph). They are the rocket men of tennis, and they're getting faster. Leading the race is Ivo Karlovic, the 6 ft 10 in Croatian they call the ""King of Aces,"" who was clocked at 156 mph (251 kph) during a Davis Cup tie in Zagreb last month. The 32-year-old's world record is unlikely to go unchallenged for long. Andy Roddick has twice hit the 155 mph (249 kph) mark, and 20-year-old Canadian Milos Raonic is already firing at 153 mph (246 kph). But as serves continue to get faster, tennis is staring down a difficult problem -- what to do when rallies become a rarity, and every other point is an ace. ""Players like Raonic and Karlovic combine great technique with height and long arms to generate racket speed,"" said former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, of CNN's Open Court. ""It seems the only way to slow the serves down is to limit the size of players, cut some of their arms off, or make them stand in a hole."" But there may be an alternative. In 2002, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) included a new, larger tennis ball in its official rules. While its primary purpose is for recreational players and use at high altitude, the Type 3 ball is also intended to ""help curb where necessary the dominance of the serve and corresponding lack of rallies in the professional game."" The graphic above demonstrates how. The 6% increase in diameter means the ball travels more slowly due to greater drag, and also bounces higher. Put simply, it makes the game easier. ""That's why we've got them. We're waiting in the wings for a time when there are too many aces in professional tournaments,"" said Jamie Capel-Davies, Senior Project Technologist at the ITF. ""For the moment our research suggests reaction times are keeping up with the increases in serve speed, because the number of aces has not really increased since 2002. But when we see evidence that aces are going up, that's when the bigger balls will come into play."" ITF research suggests it's a matter of when, and not if. The mean average of men's serving speed in the four grand slams rose from 130 mph (209 kph) to 137 mph (221 kph), between 2002 and 2010. The world record stood at Greg Rusedski's mark of 149 mph (240 kph) in 2001. Just 10 years later, and the 160 mph (257 kph) barrier is very much within reach. Bigger, stronger players, along with advancements in racket technology, are pushing the envelope. But if the rocket men keep serving faster, they might not like what's coming next. ""The U.S. seniors used those bigger balls for a couple of years, and they were soundly voted down. Not one player like them,"" Cash said. ""It was impossible to hit a winning volley and the ball dipped severely -- making it easier to keep the ball in court. ""Introducing them would be a move in the wrong direction. Tennis is becoming like a video game as it is, with the lack of variety on the shot-making front. Taking the volley out of the game with larger balls will ruin the game. Bring your caffeine pills to keep you awake."" Capel-Davies admits the bigger balls won't be to everyone's liking: ""Players will feel like they have to hit the ball harder to gain the same power with their shots, and some of our research suggests they could tire more easily."" When the alternative could be a sport where the giant serve is all-powerful, and matches could effectively be over in half the time, the ITF may be left with little choice. Reaction times have a ceiling, and when that's reached a glut of aces will likely prompt the ITF to act. Forget ""New balls, please"" -- the call for the next generation could well be, ""Bigger balls, please.""","Ivo Karlovic broke the world record for the fastest serve in a Davis Cup match in March .
The Croat was clocked at 155 mph (251 kph) to beat Andy Roddick's previous mark .
Type 3 tennis balls were introduced by the ITF in 2002, and are 6% bigger in diameter .
They are seen as a potential solution if the number of aces begins to increase ."
"(CNN) -- Canada's Conservative Party was riding to a definitive victory as results from national elections came in early Tuesday. Preliminary results also showed that Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper would remain in power for the third time and also showed that a left-leaning political party, the New Democratic Party, would be propelled to the historic position as the country's official opposition. But equally as momentous, Canada's separatist party from Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois, was nearly wiped off the political map in Monday's election, returning just a handful of members of parliament to the Canadian House of Commons. According to preliminary results from Elections Canada, Harper is set to win his first majority government with 166 seats out of a possible 308. His party's share of the popular vote in Canada stood at about 40%, as most of the votes were counted from across the country. The election started with a whimper and a near collective moan from Canadians, as many called this an unnecessary election. But about three weeks into the five week campaign, the so-called 'Orange Crush' hit Quebec, orange being the party colors of the New Democratic Party. From his campaign headquarters in Calgary, Harper hailed the Conservative victory, saying Canadians had made a clear choice. ""They chose hope, hope and unity of purpose and a strong Canada,"" said Harper before adding that he would be a leader for all Canadians. While polls had predicted the New Democratic Party's popularity, the results stunned even party insiders. Party leader Jack Layton said that Canadians had said no to ""politics of usual."" The surge of support for the NDP in Quebec turned out to be a game-changer not just in that province but across the country. ""Tonight Canadians voted to improve health care -- public health care,"" Layton said, underscoring his party's policies in support of seniors and families. Michael Ignatieff, the former Harvard scholar who returned to Canada in 2005 to get into politics, led his Liberal party to arguably one of its worst defeats. For the first time, the party of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau finished third. ""It is tough to lose like this,"" Ignatieff bluntly told supporters in Toronto. ""Democracy teaches hard lessons and we have to learn them all,"" he said. ""Leaders have to accept their historic responsibility for their historic defeat."" This election will change the political dialogue in Canada with the Conservatives potentially in full control of law-making in the House of Commons. Some of Harper's priorities for defense, the economy and justice issues now stand a much better chance of becoming law. The head of Canada's Green party also made history on Monday night. Elizabeth May became the first Green party member to be elected to parliament. The election was called after Canada's House of Commons passed a no-confidence resolution aimed at Harper's government, triggering the dissolution of Parliament. Liberal party leader Michael Ignatieff sponsored the resolution, citing a recent House committee report that found the government in contempt for failing to provide lawmakers with requested information on its spending plans.","Preliminary results shows Canada's Conservative Party winning 166 parliament seats .

"(CNN) -- Goals from Gonzalo Higuain and, who else, Cristiano Ronaldo helped Real Madrid claim their first trophy of the season on Wednesday night against arch rivals Barcelona, who had to play for more than an hour with ten men after Adriano was shown a straight red card in the 27th minute. Barcelona had won the first leg 3-2, but Madrid's pair of away goals proved vital as their 2-1 win at the Bernabeau handed them the title on away goals. The Catalan side have won the last three Supercups. Madrid showed they had recovered from their poor start to the league season with an incredible opening spell that overwhelmed their opponents. Gonzalo Higuain got the stadium rocking with a goal in the 11th minute, as he latched on to a hopeful long ball that Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano completely misjudged, and fired past a helpless Victor Valdes. Barely seven minutes later Madrid doubled their lead. Another long ball caused panic among the Barcelona defence - this time the normally impeccable Gerard Pique was at fault -- and Ronaldo was perfectly placed to make the most of the chaos. The Portuguese striker flicked a delightful ball over Pique before dispatching the ball into Valdes' bottom corner to leave the Barcelona defense in shell shock. Ten minutes later, Barcelona's capitulation was complete as Adriano, playing out of position at left back after a pre match injury to Dani Alves forced Jordi Alba to switch flanks with the Brazilian, was shown a deserved red card for hauling down Ronaldo as he broke through on goal. On the stroke of half time, Lionel Messi hauled his side back in to the tie with an incredible 28 yard free kick that whistled past Iker Casillas on its way into the top corner. Barcelona improved in the second half, but couldn't find a way through a resolute Madrid defense. Even when they did break through the back four, Spain captain Iker Casillas showed why he is one of the most respected goalkeepers in the world with a series of outstanding saves. With ten minutes to go, Real manager introduced $50m signing Luka Modric for his debut following his move from Tottenham Hotspur.","Real Madrid beat Barcelona on away goals to take first trophy of season .

"(CNN) -- In a letter to the NCAA disclosed Wednesday, the Justice Department said it has received several requests for an antitrust investigation into the current Bowl Championship Series system, and it wants information to help it decide what to do. That controversial system makes it very difficult for teams in some athletic conferences to qualify for major bowl games, potentially costing millions of dollars in revenue to those not chosen. ""Serious questions continue to arise suggesting that the current BCS system may not be conducted consistent with the competition principles expressed in federal antitrust laws,"" Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney told NCAA President Mark Emmert. The decision to release the letter came hours after Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a major opponent of the current system, demanded further consideration of the issue in a face-to-face appearance with Attorney General Eric Holder at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Holder responded by disclosing the Justice Department had sent a letter to the NCAA on the issue Tuesday. In her letter, Varney asked Emmert to explain why college football does not have a playoff when so many other college sports do. She also asked what steps, if any, the NCAA has taken to create a playoff, and whether the NCAA has determined that there are aspects of the BCS system that do not serve interests of fans, colleges, universities, and players. Officials acknowledge the NCAA is not legally required to respond, although lawyers following the case expect the association to do so. Antitrust lawyers have been watching the debate grow for more than two years, to see whether the Justice Department will jump into the case. One antitrust expert who declares himself neutral in the case says he doubts Justice will launch a probe because it has a full plate of more pressing issues. ""There is a problem, but not an antitrust problem,"" said Gordon Schnell of the New York firm Constantine Cannon. A court could never require a football playoff, but they could break up the current BCS system, he said. Currently, the BCS system limits automatic bids to the winners of the Big Ten, Big East, Big 12, Atlantic Coast Conference, Pac 10 and the Southeast Conference, thereby leaving out other conferences, including almost all schools in the Rocky Mountain Region. Only two remaining at-large spots are available to all other colleges and universities.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi went on the attack Tuesday, pushing opposition fighters back to the outskirts of a key oil town, rebels said. Also Tuesday, world diplomats met in London to discuss the future of the North African nation. Opposition fighters in Bin Jawad battled Gadhafi forces and came under a hail of artillery and rocket attacks, a rebel source said. CNN saw rebel fighters streaming back out of the city, beating what looked to be a hasty retreat. One said the barrage was too much for the opposition to withstand, and that Gadhafi loyalists had infiltrated Bin Jawad. Rebel forces regrouped in the nearby city of Ras Lanuf, a key oil town that they said they seized on Sunday. They came under heavy fire on the western edge of that city, said the rebels, who responded in kind, firing back with whatever weapons were available. Tuesday's fighting marked a reversal of the momentum of the opposition, which until recently had faced relatively little resistance in its westward march. Elsewhere in Libya, three loud explosions were heard in Tripoli. The blasts came within about a 20-minute span and were the first time since the uprising began that such blasts were heard during daylight in the Libyan capitol. On state television, a bulletin attributed to a ""military source"" said that military and civilian locations were bombed in Tripoli ""by the crusader colonial aggression."" It was not immediately clear where the explosions actually took place. To the east, Libyan forces continued to pound parts of the city of Misrata Tuesday, with tanks firing mortar shells and troops using heavy artillery in an effort to retake control of the city, a witness told CNN. Coalition planes circled overhead but did not strike the tanks, he said. The day after Gadhafi's regime tried to convince journalists that it was in control of Misrata by taking them on a trip to part of the city -- but not allowing them into the city center -- his troops were killing and wounding civilians and evicting thousands of people from their homes, the witness told CNN. ""The carnage and the destruction and the human suffering from both the evictions and ... terrorizing the city -- it's beyond imagination,"" said the witness, an opposition councilman in Misrata, in western Libya. ""It's incredible."" CNN could not independently verify the witness' descriptions. Fierce battles on the ground raged in Libya as diplomats from around the world met in London to decide next steps. More than 40 foreign ministers and representatives attended the Tuesday conference, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping. ""The purpose of this conference is to broaden and deepen the coalition effort,"" said British Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""We all want to see that cease-fire. We all want to see Gadhafi go. Those things are clear. But once we have that cease-fire, we have something to work with."" Gadhafi has showed no sign of letting up his effort to crush the rebellion, which seeks an end to his nearly 42 years in power. Organizers of the conference said it will look for ways to strengthen the U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that created a no-fly zone above Libya and mandated the protection of civilians. It will also search for urgent ways to get humanitarian aid to war-torn cities like Misrata. Opposition fighters have credited coalition airstrikes with helping them advance in their rebellion, but say more are needed. The witness in Misrata on Tuesday pleaded for coalition forces to strike Gadhafi's forces in that city to ""save Misrata from a massacre."" Off the coast of Misrata, U.S. military planes fired at three Libyan boats, destroying one and damaging the other two, military officials said in a statement Tuesday. The Libyan ships were targeted because of reports that they were firing indiscriminately at merchant vessels in the port of Misrata on Monday, the statement said. Libyan state TV had a banner Tuesday saying, ""Civilian and military locations in Misrata, Tripoli, Zaltin, Mazda and al-Watiyaare being bombed by the crusaders and colonial enemies."" The central group representing the opposition in Libya and working to plan a new government if Gadhafi were to fall issued a statement Tuesday describing its ""vision of a democratic Libya."" ""We have learned from the struggles of our past during the dark days of dictatorship that there is no alternative to building a free and democratic society and ensuring the supremacy of international humanitarian law and human rights declarations,"" the statement from the Interim National Council said. The group, representing numerous areas throughout Libya, has been meeting in Benghazi. In the statement, the council vowed to draft a constitution, guarantee key rights to every Libyan citizen, respect freedom of expression and establish ""a state that draws strength from our strong religious beliefs in peace, truth, justice, and equality."" Much of the statement focused on promises to build a better economy that would eradicate poverty. About a third of Libyans live at or below the national poverty line. The declaration makes no reference to religious freedom. Mahmoud Shammam, a spokesman for the council, said the future government would try members of the Gadhafi regime, not ""hang people in the street."" ""We are going to establish law and order,"" he said in London. ""We are not going to take revenge on the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of the council Tuesday at the meeting, part of a U.S. effort to expand ties with rebel leaders fighting to oust Gadhafi. It was the second meeting in less than two weeks between Clinton and the Libyan Interim National Council's Mahmoud Jabril, a former head of Libya's economic planning council. Clinton warned that military action against Gadhafi would continue until he ""ceases his attacks on civilians, pulls his troops back from places they have forcibly entered, and allows key services and humanitarian assistance to reach all Libyans."" President Barack Obama gave interviews to all three major U.S. television networks Tuesday, in which he made it clear he would be open to arming the rebel fighters. ""I'm not ruling it out, but I'm also not ruling it in,"" Obama told NBC in one of the separate interviews he gave the day after a nationally televised speech on the Libya situation. ""I think it's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya, we probably could,"" Obama told ABC. ""We're looking at all our options at this point."" The United States will also send a liaison to Benghazi to open up a more direct line of communication with members of the opposition, a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday. The official did not say when. The U.S. government has spent about $550 million on the Libya effort, the Pentagon said Tuesday, adding that about 60% of that went for munitions. Another $40 million is expected to be spent over the next three weeks. After that, costs are expected to be about $40 million per month, said Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kesler.

"(CNN) -- Forensic experts have unearthed about 68 bodies from another cluster of mass graves in war-torn Ivory Coast, a United Nations spokeswoman said Monday. Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, said human rights investigators found a total of 10 mass graves in the Yopougon district, near the country's commercial capital of Abidjan, over the weekend. According to U.N. investigations, the Yopougon killings appear to be related to an April 12 massacre in which supporters of former President Laurent Gbagbo staged an attack on supporters of Alassane Ouattara. Gbagbo's unwillingness to hand over power to Ouattara after last year's presidential election -- even after Ouattara was recognized internationally as the winner -- resulted in months of violence. In April, U.N. teams found more than 200 bodies buried in a mass grave in the western town of Duekoue. More than 1,000 people have died following the contested 2010 presidential election that pitted Ouattara against Gbagbo. Ouattara was sworn in Friday as president of Ivory Coast, ending the months-long political standoff. Shamdasani said the Ivory Coast government has been cooperative in helping investigators search for clues, some of which may incriminate Outtara supporters as well as Gbagbo supporters. ""When we apply pressure, they do respond,"" she said. An independent, international commission of inquiry is investigating alleged human rights violations committed by supporters of each presidential candidate, Shamdasani said. ""Some of these crimes may amount to crimes against humanity,"" Shamdasani said. ""But for now, we can't say that with confidence.""","NEW: U.N. investigations suggest the latest bodies are from an April 12 massacre .

"London (CNN) -- Jerusalem may be steeped in thousands of years of history, but the much younger Tel Aviv in Israel is increasingly a draw for culture lovers. This city by the sea is a draw to tourists seeking sun, young people looking to sample its impressive nightlife and culture vultures eager to explore its galleries and architecture. A comparatively new city -- it was founded at the beginning of the 20th century -- its vibe is decidedly modern, with Bauhaus buildings and more recently built skyscrapers making up the urban landscape. Palm trees, meanwhile, decorate its boulevards and harbor. Tel Aviv's so-called ""White City"" -- the part built between the 1930s and 1950s, and home to impressive examples of modernist architecture -- is a UNESCO world heritage site. With its clement weather and laid-back, tolerant atmosphere, Tel Aviv is a worthwhile stop on any tour of Israel and a destination in its own right. CNN selects some of the best spots to experience the cultural side of Tel Aviv, from museums and galleries to chic bars and restaurants. Art: For modern and contemporary art, look no further than the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, with its impressive collection of modern European masterpieces and collection of Israeli art. Its temporary exhibitions are top-notch; currently, visitors can take in an exhibition of works by the city's prolific street artists, while November sees the inauguration of a new building with an exhibition of works by German artist Anselm Kiefer. The city is also home to a number of contemporary art galleries, including Sommer Contemporary Art, which mounts shows by a roster of international artists as well as Israeli-born contemporary art stars, such as painter Tal R and video artist Yael Bartana. Architecture and design: Lovers of early modern architecture can head to the Bauhaus Center, which organizes tours of the White City's collection of Bauhaus architecture. You can join a group or pick up a map and audio guide and traverse the city yourself. Design buffs, meanwhile, should make the short journey to the Design Museum in Holon. Designed by Tel Aviv-born industrial designer, architect and artist Ron Arad, the sculpted building resembles a spool of red ribbon and is as much a destination as the exhibits it contains. Performance: Tel Aviv boasts world-class theater, music and opera. Visit the HaBima National Theater, Israel's national theater, which was founded at the beginning of the 20th century as a Hebrew-language theater company in Russia. The main building has undergone a costly renovation and should be open to the public again by the end of 2011. The city is also home to the celebrated Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra, which is linked to some of the 20th century's great virtuosos, including conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, the orchestra's one-time Laureate Conductor, and Tel Aviv-born violinist Itzhak Perlman, who performed as a soloist in the orchestra's historic visit to the former Soviet Union in 1990. Music lovers can also take in an opera at the Performing Arts Center. For those wanting something a bit more avant-garde, head to the Nalaga'at Center in Jaffa Port, home to the world's first and only theater ensemble whose actors are all deaf, blind or both. The center also has a cafÃ© whose waiters are deaf, inviting visitors to, according to its website, ""communicate beyond words."" According to Amelia Thomas, Lonely Planet author, ""You'll experience your kosher meal -- including sophisticated offerings such as pistachio gnocchi and barramundi with black lentils - through touch, scent and taste alone."" Eating, sleeping, partying: Tel Aviv is often referred to as the ""city that never sleeps,"" and is buzzing with bars and clubs for willing visitors to take in on balmy summer nights. Worth a longer stop on any bar-hopper's itinerary is Betty Ford, a 1950s-inspired bar where DJs spin tunes while a fashionable, arty crowd sip cocktails. Alternatively, head to Sublet, a relaxed roof lounge with views to the sea. Thomas also recommends exploring the many bars and live music joints in the southern Florentine neighborhood. Tel Aviv is famous for its gay and lesbian scene, and has a yearly Gay Pride parade. As website Gay TLV Guide puts it, there is no single gay area in the city ""because the WHOLE CITY is GAY."" Bars to visit include Glitter and The Notorious G.A.Y. Hotels in the city are plentiful, ranging from five star hotels with spas to smaller boutique hotels oozing charm. Those looking for a luxe stay can opt for the David Intercontinental, with its spa and health and fitness center; or for a more intimate, but no less luxurious stay, head to boutique Montefiore hotel, which boasts just twelve rooms in a restored 1920s heritage building. Thomas particularly singles out its Vietnamese-inspired restaurant and ""chic 1920s vibe, with its slow-moving fans, potted palms and impeccable service."" As for food, the city's many restaurants serve all cuisines but you may also want to sample delicious bites on offer at the city's famed street stalls. And if the heat gets too much, Thomas suggests taking ""a guided tour with a difference"" -- a scuba dive in the city's Mediterranean waters, where you can explore caves and even the wreck of a former naval training ship.","Tel Aviv is Israel's hippest young city .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Chinese official warned Thursday that Tokyo's move to ""buy"" a disputed island chain in the East China Sea would hurt trade between Asia's two largest economies. The battle over ownership of the island chain, called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, will ""inevitably"" have a negative impact on Sino-Japan economic ties, Vice Minister of Commerce Jiang Zengwei said Thursday, state-run Xinhua reported. The islands sit among popular fishing waters and are also believed to be rich in oil resources. Ownership of the chain would allow exclusive commercial rights to the seas surrounding the islands. There are signs the dispute is already hurting Japanese companies. Despite booming auto sales in China, sales of Japanese car brands are down 2% in China compared to a year ago, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Meanwhile, sales of car brands from other foreign countries, including Germany, the U.S., South Korea and France, are up 25%, 19%, 12% and 4% respectively. Luo Lei, deputy secretary-general of China Automobile Dealers Association, said earlier this week that Toyota purchases have fallen 15% while Mazda sales are down 6% year over year. Tensions between China and Japan -- the world's second and third largest economies, respectively -- escalated on Friday as Chinese surveillance vessels entered the disputed area to begin patrols and ""law enforcement,"" according to Chinese state-run media. China dispatched the ships after the Japanese government bought several of the islands from a private Japanese owner earlier this week. The Chinese vessels entered Japan's territorial waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard, said Shinichi Gega, a spokesman for Japan's 11th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters. Meanwhile Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Tokyo would ""take all possible measures to ensure security"" of the islands, located between Okinawa and Taiwan. China is Japan's largest trading partner. Nearly 20% of Japanese exports last year were sold to mainland China, compared to 15.3% exported to the U.S., according to figures from the Japan External Trade Organization. At a meeting Tuesday, the Japanese government approved the purchase for 2.05 billion yen ($26.2 million) the group of small islands from the Kurihara family, a private Japanese owner, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura. China says its claim to the islands goes back hundreds of years. However Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after World War II. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- An earthquake that rattled western Turkey killed at least two people and injured dozens more, hospital and government officials said on Friday. The 5.8 magnitude quake, recorded late Thursday, occurred more than 200 miles west-southwest of the capital of Ankara, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Turkey's Kandilli Earthquake Observatory said the epicenter was the town of Simav in Kutahya province, where aftershocks rippled across the region overnight. Hospital officials in Simav reported about 150 injuries, most of them minor, and some structural damage has been reported. Emergency officials swiftly responded with search and medical crews, and supplies such as blankets, water and food. The Kutahya region recently had a scare of leaked cyanide-contaminated water from a wastewater dam after an embankment collapse. Crews are checking to see whether the dam was damaged by the quake and so far, there is ""no risk,"" said Veysel Eroglu, the environment minister.","Most of the injuries are minor, hospital officials say .

"(CNN) -- Topless photos of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, hit newsstands in yet another country Thursday, as a magazine in Denmark became at least the fifth outlet to run the pictures causing headaches for Britain's likely future queen. The Danish gossip magazine Se och Hoer ran the photos a day after its sister publication in Sweden did. They're the same photos first seen last week in the French magazine Closer, then in an Italian magazine and an Irish newspaper, Se Og Hor Danish editor Kim Henningsen said. ""It's a set of unique photos from an A-class celebrity. We are a leading gossip magazine in Denmark, and it is my job to publish them,"" Henningsen said. ""If the British royal family want to sue us, then it will happen then and we'll deal with it."" Closer was fined Tuesday for publishing the topless photographs, and ordered not to distribute the magazine in print or online. A French court ordered the magazine to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling and to pay them 2,000 euros (about $2,600). The magazine must pay a further 10,000 euros a day if it is late in handing over the photos. The magazine declined to say whether it has complied with the order. A French prosecutor opened a preliminary criminal investigation into the incident Tuesday, separate from the royal family's civil suit, the Nanterre prosecutor's office said. The royal family filed a criminal complaint seeking invasion of privacy charges against Closer and possibly the photographer, a palace spokeswoman said. Se och Hoer's editor in Sweden, Carina Loefkvist, would not discuss the identity of the photographer, but she did say her magazine bought the images Friday. The criminal and civil legal battle over the photographs would not deter the magazine, she said. ""We don't treat royalties different to other celebrities, so we would have published the photos anyway,"" she said. ""We valued the news value."" A spokesman for the royal family declined to comment on the Danish and Swedish magazines' decisions ""save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review.""

"New York (CNN) -- The stage musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" will have new safety protocols when it reopens Wednesday night, following an accident in which a performer fell and suffered serious injuries during a preview, officials said. Christopher Tierney, 31, is listed in serious condition, said Bellevue Hospital spokesman Steven Bohlen. Jonathan Dealwis, a tourist from New Zealand who was in the audience, said Tierney fell ""about 6 meters,"" or about 20 feet, Monday night. Reeve Carney is the actor who plays Spider-Man, but nine people perform Spider-Man's stunts when the character is masked, according to show spokesman Jaron Caldwell. Dealwis said the accident happened near the end of the show. ""Spider-Man was on a bridge, and Mary Jane was dangling from it,"" Dealwis said. ""I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there, but he just fell off. ... The harness, you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward."" Afterward, Dealwis said, ""it just went black, and the producer came on and said we're going to pause for a moment. You could hear Mary Jane weeping."" A producer then came out and said the show was over, Dealwis said. Some people ""clapped awkwardly,"" and one girl ""laughed mockingly,"" drawing ""disapproving glances"" from others. Dealwis said the performer was wheeled away in a neck brace and was alert when he was taken to Bellevue Hospital. Rick Miramontez, another spokesman for the show, issued a statement confirming that the performer fell from a platform and the show was stopped. ""All signs were good as he was taken to the hospital for observation,"" said Miramontez. Wednesday's matinee performance was postponed after the incident, Miramontez said, but all subsequent performances will proceed as scheduled. The Spider-Man company met Tuesday with officials from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Actors Equity and the New York State Department of Labor to discuss additional safety protocols, he said. The new unspecified measures will be enacted immediately, he added. Show director Julie Taymor said the accident was ""obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally."" ""I am so thankful that Chris is going to be all right and is in great spirits,"" Taymor said in a statement Tuesday. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our Spider-Man family and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew."" The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and The Edge, is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems.

"(CNN) -- The English Football Association (FA) added its voice to the chorus of apologies that have come in the wake of Wednesday's report into the Hillsborough Football Stadium tragedy which claimed the lives of 96 people in 1989. FA Chairman, David Bernstein said the FA was ""deeply sorry this tragedy occurred at a venue The FA selected"" and in a competition (the FA Cup) run by the governing body. ""On behalf of The Football Association I offer a full and unreserved apology and express sincere condolences to all of the families of those who lost their lives and to everyone connected to the City of Liverpool and Liverpool Football Club,"" Bernstein said in a video posted on the FA website. Panel: Police at fault in response to deadly UK stadium football crush . ""This should never have happened. Nobody should lose their lives when setting out to attend a football match and it is a matter of extreme regret and sadness that it has taken so long for these findings to be published and the truth to be told."" The Hillsborough Independent Panel report concluded that there had been serious failings by the police and emergency services as the disaster unfolded before the FA Cup semifinal match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The panel said evidence indicated that as many as 41 of those crushed could potentially have survived. ""A swifter, more appropriate, better focused and properly equipped response had the potential to save more lives,"" the report said. Bernstein commended the professional work of the panel while also praising the family support groups and others for their ""tireless commitment"" in pursuing justice for the victims. ""For 23 years, the families have suffered unbearable pain and we have profound sympathy for them,"" Bernstein said. The sentiment was echoed by current Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers. ""We have all suffered death in our lives but to have it happen to your son, daughter, brother, sister, and then have a campaign against that -- you can't begin to imagine what that must feel like,"" Rodgers said Thursday. ""My respect goes out to everyone involved in that process over 23 long, hard, arduous years and hopefully they found some sort of justice,"" he added. ""I have met with some of the campaigners since I've been here and had a shortened version of what they have been through and it has been remarkable really for all the families. ""These have suffered and none of us can begin to imagine what they have been through.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- The United Nations is desperately trying to convince donors to get generous with their pocketbooks in order to stave off further suffering in the famine-wracked Horn of Africa. The global body said almost $2.5 billion is needed to cope with the crisis. So far, it has only received 48% of that and is lacking $1.2 billion. For Somalia, where the United Nations has declared famine in five southern regions, the United Nations has received about half of the roughly $1 billion needed. ""There's been an initial response but it needs to be sustained and we are still far short of the $1 billion target that we set ourselves with some very worrying gaps,"" said Mark Bowden, the U.N. coordinator for Somalia. Impact Your World: How you can help . Bowden said the United Nations will have to go back to donors and ask for more food. But the health sector is also an area of concern. ""What happens during famine is that people die of epidemic diseases like measles and malaria ... and if we can't support health activities then we will lose a lot of lives unnecessarily."" ""We're worried that people are going to die in the next month or so and inevitably more areas will slip in to famine conditions,"" he said. The situation is particularly grave in southern Somalia, where almost 3 million people are in need of immediate assistance. In Mogadishu, U.N. agencies are assessing their ability to scale up operations after the militant Islamic group Al-Shabaab announced a withdrawal from the war-torn capital. But U.N. officials have said it is too early to gauge the consequences of the Al-Shabaab pullout. Aid continues to reach Mogadishu by sea and air, but supplies are low. In Al-Shabaab's absence, more Somalis have found the courage to defy the group's ban on foreign aid and seek refuge in government held areas. Saacid, a local aid group that runs a children's feeding center, fed 18,000 children last month. This month, it's expecting to see 25,000 children. At Banadiir Hospital, which houses Somalia's largest children's ward, the doctors work without electricity or running water. They are even running out of the saline drips used to rehydrate the malnourished. Luwal Mohamed, the doctor in charge, said supplies are so scant that it's easier to count what the hospital has rather than what it doesn't. ""The supplies that are missing is the essential equipment for lifesaving like oxygen machines, monitoring, blood pressure measurements, stethoscopes,"" Mohamed said. The United States announced Thursday an additional $17 million for the crisis, with $12 million designated for Somalia. The U.S. money is on top of the $105 million in emergency funding President Barack Obama announced Monday. ""What is happening in the Horn of Africa is the most severe humanitarian emergency in the world today and the worst that East Africa has seen in several decades,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, the Somali Football Federation lauded a $1 million donation from the governing body of international soccer. ""The FIFA humanitarian response shows that the world football governing body is not only confined to promoting football development in the lawless country, but also FIFA is playing a very big role in saving the vulnerable Somalis including some displaced by wars and draughts and some disabled by the long-exciting civil strife in the country,"" said a statement from the Somali federation. The United Nations expects the Horn of Africa emergency to persist for several months and the number of people needing help to go up by 25%. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Mogadishu and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.","The United Nations has received 48% of what it needs for Africa crisis .

"(CNN) -- Former motorsport chief Max Mosley is adamant the re-instated Bahrain Grand Prix will not go ahead because Formula One's 12 teams are unlikely to ratify the decision. The Gulf kingdom was due to host the opening race of the 2011 season in March but it was postponed because of civil unrest in the country. The body that governs F1 -- the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) -- unanimously decided to reschedule the race for October 30, and move the inaugural Indian Grand Prix to December. But Mosley, a former head of the FIA, told CNN any move to change the racing calendar needs the full support of all 12 teams that compete in the sport, and that there are bound to be objections. Bahrain's F1 race rescheduled for October . Mosley told CNN: ""I'd be astonished if it happened. I think the decision was the wrong one and I think it is bound to be reversed. I don't think there's any chance there will be a Bahrain Grand Prix on October 30 and I think its most unlikely there will be one this year. Webber: F1 wrong to reinstate Bahrain . ""When you're going to change something in the middle of the season, like the proposal to move the Indian race for example, that needs the unanimous agreement of all the teams. I don't think there's the slightest chance of that actually being given. ""The teams have complete power in this particular case because although the governing body can cancel an event for reason of force majeure - as happened in the case of Bahrain -- when you want to put an event on or move an event, that's a change to the conditions under which the teams entered for the season and that's like any contract -- you can only change it if both sides agree. ""All 12 teams would have to agree to change the Indian date and go back to Bahrain, so it only takes one team to say 'I don't agree' and that'll be the end of it. It would not be possible for it to happen."" FIA president Jean Todt and vice-president Carlos Garcia visited Bahrain before announcing their decision, but it drew criticism from The Bahrain Center for Human Rights and current Red Bull driver Mark Webber. The Australian said he thought going back to Bahrain would only cause more tension. ""Like it or not, F1 and sport in general isn't above having a social responsibility and conscience,"" he told his personal web site. Mosley said there would be no long term damage done to Formula One if the move was swiftly scrapped. If it wasn't, protests could ensue, he suggested. ""I think if it gets reversed quickly and people understand what is going on in Bahrain and act accordingly, I don't think it will do any damage at all, it will just show a mistake was made that was quickly put right,"" he told CNN. ""If F1 were to persist in the idea of having a race in October I think it would do enormous damage because I think there would be protests at European and other races, some of the sponsors would come under pressure from their customers and therefore put the teams under pressure. ""I think it would be very difficult to predict how far it would go. On top of that I think there's a high likelihood, I think Mark Webber's right, you'd have some really unfortunate incident when the race took place. Happily, I think that's academic. ""It would be contrary to the rules, contrary to article 66 of the international sporting code, it would, apart from any other consideration, send a completely wrong message about what F1 is there for and what our sport is all about."" Mosley even suggested next year's race in Bahrain could be in jeopardy if problems persist. Next year: ""They must be given a chance but I don't think anybody would want to go there when people are in prison without trial, when doctors and nurses have been arrested simply for treating injured people,"" he said. ""All of those things are very disagreeable. We have to wait and see how things develop and not pre-judge it.""","Max Mosley tells CNN the re-instated Bahrain Grand Prix is unlikely to go ahead .

"(CNN) -- Hamza Ali al-Khateeb, the Syrian boy whose killing has enraged, mobilized and emboldened the country's opposition movement, once harbored dreams of being a police officer. But the 13-year-old changed his ambitions when the government crackdown went into full swing. ""When he saw police officers kill the people in the revolution, he would say, 'The police kill the people and I don't want to be like them. I do not know what I will be but the police kill people and torture them,'"" according to one of his relatives, who escaped to Kuwait amid the regime's suppression of protesters. The relative asked not to be named out of fear for the safety of his family in Daraa, the southwestern city where the anti-regime demonstrations started in mid-March. Family members say Hamza got separated from his father in the chaos during demonstrations around Daraa on April 29, when protesters marched on the city to break the Syrian military siege and force the delivery of important supplies, such as medicine and milk for babies. A few weeks ago, the family received the boy's body. A video that showed up on YouTube displays an appalling and mutilated corpse; much of the video is too graphic to broadcast. The face is bloated and purple and his body is covered in bruises. There are gunshot wounds to his torso and his genitals are mutilated. CNN cannot independently verify what happened to Hamza or the authenticity of the video. His death has punctuated the domestic and international outcry against the clampdown by President Bashar al-Assad's government against peaceful protests. ""I can only hope that this child did not die in vain,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said this week. Patrick McCormick, a spokesman for the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said children are not immune to the civil unrest across the region. ""The pictures are shocking. They have gone all over the world. And no one could see that without being deeply moved and ashamed about what happened to that boy,"" he said. ""I have no idea why anybody would brutalize a young boy like that. I cannot even begin to go there. We just know that somehow it happened."" UNICEF is calling for investigations so the perpetrators can be brought to justice, ""some sort of justice in a situation that's volatile,"" McCormick said. ""We want to get to the bottom of it."" The relative, interviewed Thursday by CNN, described Hamza as a smart kid who loved school and soccer, and who was raised in a modest setting where he was the youngest child of a laborer. ""He was only 13 years old but he had the maturity of a 30-year-old,"" the relative said. The boy supported the demonstrations and would refuse to eat during the military's late April siege in Daraa because others didn't have food and he felt it would be unfair to eat while they went hungry. Hamza would accompany his family to protests, waving a Syrian flag and chanting, ""No Hezbollah and No Iran. We want freedom,"" the relative said. The relative said he, Hamza and other members of their extended family took to the streets on the day the boy got lost and apparently swept up by Syrian officials. Children accompanied the marchers, the relative said, because ""we did not expect people to shoot."" ""Hamza was among the children and carried a small Syrian flag with three stars, the flag of Syrian independence."" After he went missing, his family searched for days but failed to find him. Eventually, another relative got a tip that Hamza was being held in prison, saw the boy alive and well, and begged the security forces to free him. Security officials asked Hamza's family to return in two days and said they would release the teen. However, the first relative told CNN, ""the security forces were angry at us, asking how we found out where Hamza was and infuriated that we had found him. Then they tortured the poor boy for two days."" When the parents went to the prison, security officials told them to go to the hospital. That's where they found the corpse. ""We went to the hospital and what we saw was horrific. His mother had a nervous breakdown. These are people who are not afraid of God who do not know God,"" the relative said of the security officials. The family took Hamza back to his village for burial and held a wake in the child's honor. ""His father was destroyed and his mother seemed to have lost her sanity crying for him one minute and then yelling shrills of joy for his martyrdom the next,"" the relative said. The relative said that the night the family received the body, Hamza's father was arrested and taken away by security forces. The security forces threatened him and told him not to speak to any media outlets, human rights organizations or anyone else. ""They told him we have killed one of your children and we can kill the rest of them too,"" he said. Syrian state TV on Tuesday ran a segment in which a person identified as the medical examiner in the case said the body's injuries were sustained when the boy was alive, but there was no evidence on the surface of the body that the boy had been subjected to torture, violence or retaliation. The medical examiner said proper procedures to identify the body were followed after the body first arrived, and went on to describe how a body deteriorates in phases after death, turning dark brown, for example, with parts becoming enlarged. The boy's death, he said, was the result of the three gunshot wounds he sustained. Syria TV also said al-Assad met with members of Hamza's family on Tuesday, and it showed men it identified as the boy's father and uncle who said that al-Assad was very welcoming and understanding, and promised reform. The relative had fled Syria by the time state TV aired the video of the father and uncle thanking al-Assad. But, he said, ""I swear to you they said this because they were threatened. The father is defeated. They told him they would kill his children and destroy his family. They forced him to say this."" The man said he is very concerned about the issue of child victims and feels the regime was purposely targeting children to ""teach us a lesson."" ""There is not just one Hamza in Syria,"" the relative told CNN. ""There are hundreds of Hamzas, and these men do not know God so they will make a hundred more Hamzas.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Just days after the governor of an northeastern Afghanistan province claimed dozens of civilians were killed in a NATO-led mission targeting insurgents, new allegations of civilian casualties surfaced in a nearby province Thursday. NATO's International Security Assistance Force is investigating the claims stemming from an operation Thursday morning in the Alah Say district of Kapisa province, the military said in a statement. Armed insurgents were the target, ISAF said. ""We take civilian casualty allegations very seriously; we'll investigate this incident as quickly as possible,"" said U.S. Army Col. Patrick Hynes, director of ISAF Joint Command Combined Joint Operations Center. The incident followed a statement Sunday from the governor of Kunar province, who said that 64 people -- including 22 women and 26 young boys -- were killed in a joint operation by ISAF and Afghan security forces over a few days last week. ISAF said video evidence from the scene indicated 36 armed insurgents were killed. That incident is also under investigation.","NATO force is investigating reports of civilian casualties .

"(CNN) -- The translation of the voice below the macabre YouTube video clip reads, ""Look at the bruises on his face along with his broken neck."" The clip is a two and a half minute gruesome catalogue of wounds on a 13-year-old child's body. The body of Hamza Ali al-Khateeb. On April 29, demonstrators from villages surrounding Daraa, Syria, marched on the city in an attempt to break the Syrian military siege there. Their intent was to bring in much-needed supplies, including milk for babies and crucial medicines. At the time, the crackdown on Daraa was so intense eyewitnesses spoke of bodies bloating in the streets and the injured being treated at makeshift secret clinics to avoid detection by the Syrian security forces. On that day, eyewitnesses say, security forces fired indiscriminately on them, killing and wounding dozens. Countless others were detained in a mass roundup. Among them, says his family, was Hamza. He got separated from his father in the chaos. A month later, the family received his body. The video was taken at that time by a relative, the family says. Much of the video of the child's corpse is too graphic to broadcast. His face is bloated and purple. His body is covered in bruises. There are gunshot wounds to his torso and his genitals are mutilated. CNN cannot independently verify what happened to Hamza or the authenticity of the video. Hamza's family was threatened after the video was initially broadcast by other outlets, intermediaries told CNN, and they became too petrified to talk about what happened, even to close friends. Razan Zaitouneh, a prominent activist in hiding in Syria who CNN reached via Skype, said she has no doubt that it is real. And she believes that the regime had a message in releasing the boy's body. ""They want the people to see this, they want the people to get scared,"" Zaitouneh said. ""They want the people to know that there is no red line and anything, no matter how awful it is, could happen to their family members if they continue to participate in this revolution."" But far from terrorizing people, the video appears to have made them only bolder. People ""got angrier. Every family, every single family in Syria felt, even if they were not directly with the revolution, they felt that Hamza is their own son,"" Zaitouneh explained. More demonstrations erupted across Syria, with crowds chanting Hamza's name. According to the video posted on YouTube, men in the Damascus countryside chanted, ""Faithful brothers, do not forget that your sons could become Hamza al-Khateeb,"" while in central Syria demonstrators chanted, ""With our blood and our souls we will defend you Hamza"" Even children took to the streets, risking a similar fate, vowing that Hamza's blood was not spilled in vain. In reaction, Syrian state TV on Tuesday ran a segment in which a person identified as the medical examiner in the case said the body's injuries were sustained when the boy was alive, but there was no evidence on the surface of the body that the boy had been subjected to torture, violence or retaliation. The medical examiner said proper procedures to identify the body were followed after the body first arrived, and went on to describe how a body deteriorates in phases after death, turning dark brown, for example, with parts becoming enlarged. The boy's death, he said, was the result of the three gunshot wounds he sustained. Syria TV also said al-Assad met with members of Hamza's family on Tuesday, and it showed men it identified as the boy's father and uncle, who said that al-Assad was very welcoming and understanding, and promised reform. But in Washington, the reports about Hamza's fate drew strong words from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. In response to a question about Syria from CNN, she said she was ""very concerned with reports about the young boy."" ""In fact, I think what that symbolizes for many Syrians is the total collapse of any effort by the Syrian government to work with and listen to their own people,"" she said. ""... I can only hope that this child did not die in vain, but that the Syrian government will end the brutality and begin the transition to a real democracy."" She added, ""Every day that goes by the position of the government becomes less tenable and the demands of the Syrian people only grow stronger."" Activists say they are not surprised that the regime could have committed the kind of cruelty the YouTube video allegedly shows, and they claim that it is not the first time a child has been targeted. Another video posted to YouTube claims to show an 11-year-old child who was shot in his home. Another clip shows people trying to recover the body of a child in a street amid intense gunfire. And another shows children lying wounded in a hospital after security forces allegedly fired on their bus. Activists say these types of atrocities have been committed against the population for decades now by a regime that doesn't differentiate between ages. The difference now, they say, is that it is being talked about. Hamza's death has prompted an international outrage. A Facebook page calling itself ""We are all the martyr, the child Hamza Ali Al-Khateeb"" had 60,000 followers by Tuesday. The face of this 13-year-old from a village in southern Syria is now the symbol of an uprising.","The body of Hamza Ali al-Khateeb, 13, shows horrible injuries in a YouTube video .

"(CNN) -- While the presidential candidates spar in debates and jump on gaffes, two possibly historic votes on November 6 will cut to the most primal issues: nothing less than death and love. In California, voters will decide whether to keep the death penalty on the books in America's most populous state. Meanwhile, in my own state of Minnesota, there is a good chance that a proposed constitutional amendment to bar same-sex marriage will be defeated. Each is significant because it could represent a crucial shift in momentum and a turning point â€” away from the use of the death penalty, and toward a broader societal acceptance of gay men and women. The death penalty law in California is a mess. It is expensive in a time of fiscal crisis, and simply doesn't work. California has by far the largest death row in the nation, with more than 700 residents (Florida is next with about 400), yet it has only executed 13 people since 1976. If Californians sensibly reject continuing this failed death penalty approach, it will join five other states that have also recently abolished capital punishment: Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York. California's action would have two principle effects. First, it could lead to a reconsideration of the soundness of the death penalty in other states where it is seldom used, including Delaware, Maryland, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Pennsylvania. California is a trendsetter and it will be meaningful when the state with the largest death row gives up the cost and moral burden of capital punishment. Second, it would be a large step toward a new challenge to the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment. Since the 1980s, the Supreme Court has looked to trends in the states to evaluate where national standards are regarding what punishments are ""cruel and unusual."" In fact, such an analysis led to a constitutional ban on the death penalty in cases where the defendant committed the crime as a juvenile or suffered a mental defect. Moving California to the abolition side would commit a large fraction of the American population to leaning away from the death penalty. It may well be that the best way to get rid of the death penalty in Texas is to abolish it in California. While California considers the state's ability to kill its citizens, Minnesota will decide an issue related to love. While Minnesota is not a population giant, the symbolic value of the upcoming referendum on same-sex marriage in that state has huge symbolic importance. The proposed amendment would insert into the Minnesota Constitution a definition of marriage as between one man and one woman (the state's statutes already contain this definition). Some 30 states (most recently North Carolina) have already amended their constitutions to include similar language. Three other states â€” Maine, Maryland and Washington â€” are voting on whether to allow same-sex marriage (essentially the opposite question from the one posed in Minnesota). The Minnesota vote is perhaps the most significant, though, because it could break the unbeaten streak of those who have pushed bans on same-sex marriage into state constitutions. It would reflect an overextension of that effort and a crucial shift going the other way. Right now, polling on the Minnesota marriage amendment is roughly even, while California polls show death penalty abolitionists behind. The remaining weeks will be crucial in each contest. History often moves when we aren't watching, and political epochs rarely align with elections. Rather, Americans sometimes change their consensus over time, and nearly always there was a noticeable swing in momentum at a time we can name. For example, with the civil rights movement, it was not a presidential election that marked a turning point, but something as simple as a brave woman on a bus. Should the people of California and Minnesota choose less death and more love, respectively, this, too, could be one of those moments. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Osler.","Voters in California will decide on death penalty and those in Minnesota on gay marriage .
Mark Osler: Each is significant because it could represent a turning point in history .
Osler: Let's see if Californians and Minnesotans choose less death and more love ."
"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Two South Korean soldiers fired at a civilian airplane after mistaking it for an aircraft from North Korea, a South Korean military official said Saturday. No damage was caused by the firing Friday morning, said the official, who requested anonymity in keeping with South Korean military custom. The two soldiers were stationed off the coast of Gyodong Island, near the North Korean border, when they fired their rifles at an Asiana Airlines flight, the military official said. The plane was not damaged because it was about 500 meters (547 yards) out of the range of the K-2 rifles used by two soldiers, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said, citing an unidentified military source. According to the Yonhap report, the plane was carrying about 119 crew and passengers from China, and was making its descent to Incheon International Airport. CNN's Jiyeon Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.","NEW: A South Korean military official tells CNN two soldiers fired at the plane .

"(CNN)  -- James Morrison was hospitalized on Tuesday night with a recurrence of Crohn's disease but after a second successive 66 has taken the halfway lead in the French Open at Le Golf National near Paris. The 26-year-old has suffered from the debilitating disease, which causes intestinal inflammation, for the past decade and nearly pulled out of the tournament. But showing incredible resolve, he has a one-shot advantage joint overnight leader Richard Green of Australia after Fridays' play. Green had moved one clear at 11-under, but a double bogey on the water-protected 18th left the courageous Morrison ahead. ""It's something I've been used to dealing with on a daily basis,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""I'm feeling a little bit drained, but I play better with that because I don't have expectations . ""I feel a bit worse for wear and just stroll through the day."" Morrison's ""stroll"" comprised of a five-under par back nine of 31 to ignite his round to leave him clear of the field. England's Mark Foster, who challenged at the BMW International last week, continued his good form to be four shots back in third after shooting a second straight 68. Graeme Storm, who shared the first round lead on 65 with Green, was undone by a quadruple bogey eight on the last as he found the water twice and carded a 75 to undermine his challenge. World number four Martin Kaymer of Germany is also way off the pace on two under, one better than former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie, whose chances of claiming a British Open spot by a high finish look over. But at least they made the cut as defending champion Miguel Angel Jimenez, American star Bubba Watson and last week's winner Pablo Larrazabal did not survive for the weekend.","James Morrison of England leads French Open after two rounds of 66 .

"(CNN) -- Many boxers have aspired to be the next Julio Cesar Chavez, but only one man was born to be. His dad is an icon, a tiny man who cast a huge shadow. A man who lifted the entire nation of Mexico with his hands. And despite his 46 victories without a defeat, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. still has to answer the questions about his famous father, still has to punch through the skepticism, still has to face opponents who he says underestimate him because just they don't think he's as good as his dad. ""I can't help that people say that stuff about me. I am the son, and that is who I am,"" the 26-year-old said last week. ""He is my dad, but little by little, I have proven myself. I have proven it in the ring."" The man he fights Saturday night in Las Vegas is another doubter. But he's more than that: He's terribly angry that his title was taken away and that of all people, the younger Chavez was the one who got it. Sergio Martinez thinks it is a joke that Chavez is the WBC middleweight champion. He doesn't believe that Chavez has the skills. It was his name that won him a belt. Looking back at 'Latino in America': Olympic boxer fights to inspire . ""The only reason he is world champion is because he is Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., the son of the legend,"" said Martinez, who is 49-2-2 and considered the third best fighter in the world, regardless of weight division. He will easily be Chavez's most difficult opponent, and long-time boxing announcer Jim Lampley of HBO Sports, which will show the fight on pay-per-view,  sees it as an intriguing match of opposites. Where Chavez is bigger and has often employed a simple, direct fight plan, Martinez moves quickly, is a cerebral boxer who thoroughly studies his opponent. Even at age 37, he will wear a foe down with superior conditioning. ""Martinez is a matador of the highest order, and Chavez is a bull of the highest order,"" Lampley said. One thing that helps Chavez, Lampley said, is that he has a great chin -- that is, the ability to take a strong punch to the head -- like his father. Experts' predictions for Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.-Sergio Martinez . Unlike his father, though, Chavez didn't grow up poor. Boxing wasn't a way out and a way up. It was a way to impress his father, whom Chavez calls his idol. Junior was always around boxing. He'd go to his father's workouts, even when he was very young. Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. won his first 87 fights, taking titles in three weight divisions. He ended his career with a record of 107-6-2, including 15 victories over men who were or would become champions. ESPN ranked him as the 24th best boxer of all time, and the Ring said in 2002 that he was among the top 20 fighters during the magazine's 80 years of publication. But to young Julio, he was also a drunk and drug addict who was often hard to live with while growing up. It was the son who took the boxing legend to rehab. The struggling father disowned his son but later thanked him. ""I would have died,"" the elder Chavez told HBO for the documentary series ""24/7."" (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) Today, the father is a businessman with restaurants and car dealerships and an energy drink. But as his son's fight with Martinez approaches, the legendary fighter is a very interested observer and anxious teacher. One evening, as night owl Julio Jr. emerges from his slumber, the father tries to give the begrudging student a lesson on how to box Martinez, who will seek to constantly move just outside Chavez's reach. The son looks disinterested and then jumps into the pool as his father continues to shadowbox and shout advice. Later, the son sets up a spontaneous training session at the rental house where he is staying before the fight instead of going to the gym. It's nights like this that anger his trainer, himself a legend in boxing for having coached more than 30 world champions. But none of them keeps a schedule like Chavez, Freddie Roach said. The boxer trains where he wants to. At the gym, at the house, even outside at a cookout. He sleeps through most hours of daylight and then gets up and figures out whether he is going to meet Roach for a workout. Sometimes, he doesn't even go to the gym until 2 a.m. Sometimes, he doesn't go at all, calling Roach, who has waited hours, and telling him his body isn't up to it today. It frustrates the coach, who also trains Manny Pacquiao, among others. But he tolerates it. ""It's OK, as long as we get the work done,"" he said. Lampley, who will call Saturday's fight, said Chavez has improved greatly since inviting Roach into his corner. ""He has a far greater sense of where to be and when to be somewhere in the ring,"" Lampley said. ""He moves with much greater fluidity. He can set things up. He used to just walk in and fire punches. Now he does more to set up his punches, particularly the left hook to the body."" Just like his old man. Roach admitted he's had work to do with the young prospect. ""He has the instincts of a fighter; he's just not a natural fighter like his father was,"" Roach said. It is certain that Martinez, who came to the sport very late at age 20, doesn't think Chavez is the fighter his father was. During a dual interview with boxing analyst Max Kellerman, Martinez glared at Chavez and said, ""You're living in a delusion, based on your legendary father. When are you going to stop believing that?"" To which Chavez retorted, ""I will never stop being my father's son."" But for Chavez to stop being just a son of legend and start on the path to becoming a legend himself, he'll have to beat Martinez on Saturday.","Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. fights Sergio Martinez in a championship match Saturday .

"(CNN)  -- Petra Kvitova stunned Maria Sharapova in straight sets 6-3 6-4 to claim the  Wimbledon women's singles title Saturday. The 21-year-old had gone into the final as the underdog against three-time grand slam champion Sharapova, but belied that status with a high-class display on Centre Court. She is the third Czech woman, after Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotna, to claim the Wimbledon singles crown. Both were in the Royal Box to witness her triumph and Kvitova paid them both a compliment as she savored her victory. ""It's hard to find some words, to see the great players in the Royal Box,"" said Kvitova, the first left-hander since Navratilova in 1990 to win the title. ""It's very nice when they're watching me all the time and supporting me, it's great."" Russia's Sharapova was bidding to repeat her success as 17-year-old in 2004, but despite breaking Kvitova in her very first service game was largely second-best against an opponent hitting with pace and accuracy. Eighth seed Kvitova, beaten in the semifinals by eventual winner Serena Williams last year, responded with two breaks of Sharapova's service to take the first set in 40 minutes. She immediately broke Sharapova at the start of the second set and appeared to be in control, but the fifth seed retrieved it to level at two games all. Sharapova looked to gain momentum but she surrendered her service again only to show great resilience to break back again. But it was her last glimpse of glory as Kvitova broke again for 4-3 to close on her maiden grand slam title. Serving for the championship at 5-4, Kvitova carved out three match points and clinched it with an ace, sinking to the turf in triumph. But in contrast, it was a bitter disappointment for Sharapova, who has battled back to the top of the game after serious shoulder surgery. ""It's great to be back at this stage and holding the runner-up plate -- but I wanted the big one today,"" said Sharapova. ""But it's something I want to be back for and holding again one day.""

"NOTRE-DAME-DE-MESAGE, France (Reuters) -- Twenty-six Polish pilgrims died when their coach crashed off a mountain road at a notorious accident black spot in the French Alps and burst into flames, police and officials say. Emergency officials say most of the passengers who died perished in the fire. Another 24 people were injured, 14 critically, when the coach smashed through a roadside barrier on the steep Laffrey gradient, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the southeastern city of Grenoble. The coach careened 40 meters down the slopes before coming to rest on the banks of the Romanche river. Most of the victims died in the fire, said emergency officials, and DNA forensic experts from Paris would be needed to identify the bodies. Television pictures showed several bodies laid out under white sheets on the river banks, the coach smoldering in the background as fire crews doused it with foam. Several helicopters and a fleet of emergency vehicles ferried the injured to hospital in Grenoble in an operation that mobilized 60 police as well as fire-fighters. Robert Caban, owner of the Polish transport firm that hired out the coach, told the Polish news agency PAP the drivers were experienced and the 7-year-old Scania coach had passed technical inspections recently in Germany. France's LCI television quoted him as saying that he had alerted his men to the route's dangers. He said he had driven the coach himself recently and its brakes had then worked well. Reports said the Poles, from the Szczecin area of northwest Poland, had been due to return home on Tuesday after two weeks on pilgrimage in Spain and France. ""My daughter got in touch with me. She's got a broken leg and collarbone and head injuries and is badly shaken up,"" Poland's TVN24 quoted a weeping Malgorzata Wachowiak as saying of her daughter Karolina, aged 22. ""It is a dangerous road, so dangerous that coaches that don't have the authorization to take it, which seems to be the case here, are banned from taking it,"" French Prime Minister Francois Fillon told reporters after visiting the scene. ""Doubtless the best thing to do is ensure that this type of vehicle does not take such a difficult route as this."" Gendarme [police] Lt. Col. Thierry Rousseau said: ""Witnesses spoke of a problem with the braking system, an unusual black smoke."" Local officials said the coach's speed may also have been a factor in the accident. French President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a message of condolence to his Polish counterpart Lech Kaczynski and would meet the Polish president at Grenoble airport when he arrived later on Sunday, the French presidency said. Maciej Lopinski, an aide to the Polish president, told PAP that the victims' families would receive financial support from a special presidential fund. Sunday's accident happened close to where a Belgian coach crashed in July 1973, killing 43 people. Robert Caban, owner of the transport firm that hired out the coach, told PAP the drivers were experienced and the seven-year-old Scania coach was in good condition. ""Ahead of the pilgrimage the coach underwent a thorough check-up in Germany and everything was in order. Before going on the pilgrimage it had traveled to Spain, and everything was in order,"" PAP quoted him as saying.

"(CNN) -- Thursday's massacre of 11 students at a Brazilian school could have been even worse, were it not for the heroic actions of a military policeman, according to a statement from the Rio de Janeiro state governor's office. Third Sgt. Marcio Alexandre Alves, 38, and a colleague raced to the Municipal School Tasso da Silveira in Realengo after they were approached by a student two blocks away from the school, who asked them for help, the governor's office said. Upon arriving at the school, Alves heard gunshots and quickly climbed to the second floor. There, he confronted the heavily armed gunman coming out of a classroom, keeping the suspect from ascending to the third floor, where there were more students, the statement said. Alves said he shot the gunman in the abdomen. When the suspect fell, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, according to the statement. At that point, Alves looked for a second suspect he had heard was in the building, but that information turned out to be unfounded, the governor's office said. Alves, an 18-year veteran of police work, said seeing the slain children gave him a great feeling of sadness. ""Scenes that will not be easily erased from my memory. I have a son that age,"" Alves said. ""But it was also a sense of accomplishment. I wish I would've arrived there sooner (to save more children). Had I gotten there five minutes earlier, I could have avoided some deaths,"" the statement said. Brazil's president has announced three days of national mourning. Beyond the 11 students killed, another 13 were injured, four of whom were in critical condition, Rio Health Secretary Sergio Cortes said. The Rio de Janeiro Civil Police released the names of nine of the massacred students to Agencia Brasil. the official state-run media. They are: . Karine Chagas de Oliveira, 14 . Rafael Pereira da Silva, 14 . Milena dos Santos Nascimento, 14 . Mariana Rocha de Souza, 12 . Atanazio Larissa Santos . Bianca Tavares Rocha, 13 . Luiza Paula da Silveira, 14 . Laryssa Silva Martins, 13 . Gessica Guedes Pereira . ""The greatest difficulty is the family's pain. It is very hard to identify a son or a daughter in a situation like this,"" Cortes said. ""It's a state of general commotion here, families, doctors, everyone."" Several of the children will be buried Friday at locations and times still to be determined, Agencia Brasil reported. Municipal School Tasso da Silveira is in the northern Rio neighborhood of Realengo, a middle- and lower-middle-class area located between the Pedra Branca and Mendanha mountains. The school is now a crime scene, and will remain so for an undisclosed amount of time, police said. The government said the gunman was Wellington Menezes de Oliveira, 23, a former student at the school. He was allowed to enter the school by saying he was there to obtain transcripts. According to CNN affiliate TV Record, Menezes de Oliveira entered the school in the morning armed with two handguns and began shooting at children and school personnel. He was firing ""indiscriminately,"" Agencia Brasil said. There were reports that he had left a letter behind that mentioned he had HIV, Agencia Brasil said. Other details from the letter were not immediately disclosed and the gunman's motive remained unclear. The Rio government said they found no previous criminal record of Menezes de Oliveira. An amateur video posted on YouTube showed the police arriving at the school as onlookers watched from the front of the school. Repeated high-pitched screams can be heard as students begin sprinting out of the school in a line. One girl runs by with her shirt stained red around her abdomen. Another has what appears to be blood soaking her shoulder. The injured were transported to the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, where Agencia Brasil reported helicopters were waiting in an adjacent field, ready to transport the more seriously injured to other facilities. Police used some of those helicopters to move the victims, the government of Rio said. Rio de Janeiro's Hematology Institute, which coordinates the distribution of blood for transfusions, put out a call via Twitter for donations to the hospital. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said she was ""shocked"" by the attack and had ""great concern"" about the incident. She said mass shootings were rare in Brazil. ""It's uncharacteristic for our country to have this type of crime,"" she said in a speech. ""For that reason, I consider that all of us are united in rejecting this type of violence, especially against defenseless children."" Rio's governor, Sergio Cabral, called the gunman a ""psychopath."" ""I agree that we have an obligation to give solidarity and support to the families of the young victims of this psychopath,"" he said. The school where the shooting happened is a public school with about 800 students. CNN's Rafael Romo and journalists Luciani Gomes and Catalina Arica contributed to this report .","NEW:Sgt.

"(CNN) -- As dozens of Palestinian rockets rained down on southern Israel, the country's air force carried out new raids on positions in Gaza on Wednesday. Two days of airstrikes have killed four Palestinians, at least two of them identified as militants. Attacks and counterattacks between the two sides are a frequent occurrence but appear to have escalated in the past two days. On Tuesday night, the Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted two rocket-launching squads in northern Gaza as they prepared to fire into southern Israel. That attack killed two militants from Al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, and wounded two others. But the barrage of rockets continued, with more than 65 fired from Gaza in an eight-hour period, the military said Wednesday morning. Israeli aircraft struck Gaza again early Wednesday, killing two people and seriously wounding nine others, said Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza. The strike targeted a rocket-launching site in northern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces said, adding that its tanks had also shelled ""terrorist targets."" The Palestinian rocket attacks wounded three Thai workers in Israel, hospital officials said. Israeli areas across Gaza are under heightened alert amid fears that more rockets could be launched. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Israel ""neither chose nor initiated this escalation, but if it continues, we are prepared for much more extensive and deeper action. In any case, we will continue with preventative operations. Whoever intends to attack Israeli citizens needs to know that he will bear the consequences."" Defense Minister Ehud Barak toured areas hit by rockets in southern Israel and said the military ""is working efficiently against all the terror elements. Since the beginning of the month, 15 active terrorists have been killed in the act, and more have been injured."" He wished a speedy recovery to those injured by rockets fired from Gaza. ""Hamas will receive its punishment for what has happened here,"" he vowed, promising that Israel will ""work with patience and level-headedness."" ""There is no way to eliminate the hatred or hostility entrenched in Hamas. But the IDF will act on the border, from the air and in any other necessary way in order to strike down those who attempt to cause us harm,"" he said. Are you there?

The latest violence came after the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, visited Gaza on Tuesday, becoming the first head of state to visit since Egypt and Israel instituted a blockade in 2007. Annual Qatari aid to Palestinians in Gaza will increase from $250 million to $400 million, Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya said in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said U.S. officials ""share Qatar's deep concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people, including those residing in Gaza."" But she expressed continuing concern over the ""destabilizing role"" of Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hoops games happen all the time on aircraft carriers, but Tuesday officials from the Navy, the NCAA and Morale Entertainment met to discuss staging a major college basketball game on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson. The Carl Vinson has played key roles in the fight against terrorism almost since day one. The ship launched the first wave of air attacks on al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and most recently it was the ship from which Osama bin Laden was buried at sea. Now the Carl Vinson is on track to make sports history, as the first ever carrier to host an NCAA basketball game. The final deal hasn't been reached, but the plan, being promoted by Morale Entertainment, calls for the Michigan State Spartans to play the University of North Carolina Tar Heels on Veterans Day, November 11, on the top deck of the Carl Vinson at the U.S. naval base in San Diego at about 4 p.m. PT. ""The discussion with representatives is still ongoing. If we are able to come to a final agreement, we look forward to the opportunity this event presents for our Navy and the veterans,"" Cmdr. Danny Hernandez, U.S. Navy spokesman, said. ""We're still reviewing the proposal."" The ""Carrier Classic,"" as the game has been dubbed, would be the first televised college basketball game of the season for ESPN, which agreed to air the game if the negotiations are finalized and the Navy signs off on the deal. But it will take more than a deal to pull the game off. First there's the game itself. Unlike indoor arenas, the deck of an aircraft carrier would mean possible winds, rain or sunshine. To cope with possible weather problems, two courts would be built on the ship: One up on the flight deck, the other below in the hangar deck, which would be protected from rain and some wind. The seating for the flight deck stadium would be wrapped with fabric to help block the wind, which college basketball players typically don't have to cope with. As for the sunshine, the ship would be moored alongside a pier that would put the sun about midcourt, so no players would have to shoot into the setting sun. Plus a professional lighting crew that does lighting for rock concerts has been contacted about bringing in lights to help keep the court lit enough for the players and the TV cameras. Another issue is security. An aircraft carrier is the Navy's most important asset. The game would attract about 7,000 fans. Getting them onto a secure Navy base and then on board a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier would take a significant security effort. Part of that has been addressed by the promoters, who don't plan to sell tickets to the public. Instead, some tickets will go to UNC and MSU and a few to sponsors as well as some youth coaches who take part in an onshore clinic. The rest of the tickets will go to service members, veterans and their families. Plus, Morale Entertainment spokesman Mike Whalen said each ticket will have the name of the ticket holder printed on the front to prevent scalping. If the name on the ticket doesn't match your ID, no game for you. The Navy also needs the promoters and ESPN, which plans to bring a dozen or more cameras to cover the game, to know that at any moment the president could order the Carl Vinson to leave port for a mission. Which means the basketball courts, and bleachers would have to come off the ship just as 5,000-plus sailors and Marines would have to come aboard. Whalen said he has assured the Navy it would be prepared to break down both courts and all the seating very quickly if need be. ""We can be off the ship 24 to 36 hours,"" Whalen said. To make sure of that, nothing will be bolted or welded to the ship. Instead, they will use ""tie-downs"" that are already on the ship's decks to hold warplanes in place. Planes are not typically on board an aircraft carrier that is in its home port. The idea for a carrier-based basketball game started at Michigan State. According to Whalen, MSU Athletic Director Mark Hollis had the idea and head basketball coach Tim Izzo liked it. In a news release from ESPN, Izzo said, ""As coaches and athletes, we are familiar with terms like wins and losses, but to our servicemen and women, those phrases have very different meanings. It's a concept that first hit home during one of my trips to visit our troops in Kuwait, and one that I've carried with me since then."" The Navy spent Monday and Tuesday with officials from the NCAA, Morale Entertainment, ESPN and the San Diego Sports Commission in detailed discussions about the game. They've given the officials tours of the ship, let them see the areas that could be used for the game and the potential problems that could crop up. As if the idea of the first carrier-borne NCAA game isn't enough to interest you, perhaps this will: Former UNC star Michael Jordan and former MSU star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson are the honorary captains for the game. And if the game goes off as planned and is successful, there are already talks about having more games, including a match-up between the Notre Dame and Ohio State women's basketball teams.","Navy is in talks for potential ""Carrier Classic""

"Chicago (CNN) -- The week-old teachers strike in Chicago's public schools will continue into the new week, after a representative group of the Chicago Teachers Union decided not to end the walkout even though union leaders and school officials had reached a tentative contract deal. The move left Mayor Rahm Emanuel vowing to go to court to force teachers back to work, calling Sunday's actions by the union ""a delay of choice that is wrong for our children."" The mayor announced in a statement that he's asked city lawyers ""to file an injunction in circuit court to immediately end this strike."" He contended the strike is illegal because ""it is over issues that are deemed by state law to be nonstrikable, and it endangers the health and safety of our children."" ""I will not stand by while the children of Chicago are played as pawns in an internal dispute within a union,"" Emanuel said. Members of the teachers' bargaining team detailed the proposed contract to a group of 800 union representatives, called the House of Delegates, in a meeting Sunday afternoon. But Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said that, after extensive debate, the delegates said they wanted more time to discuss the contract with union members. The House of Delegates will reconvene Tuesday afternoon, at which point delegates could decide to end the strike -- or not. If they do, classes could resume at earliest on Wednesday. And even if the strike is ended, the more than 26,000-member union's rank-and-file would still have the opportunity at some point to accept, or reject, the proposed contract. As of Sunday, though, Lewis said a ""clear majority"" of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract. ""They are not happy with the agreement,"" Lewis said. There were no classes all last week for more than 350,000 students in Chicago, home to the nation's third-largest school system, when the union went on strike after failing to reach a contract agreement with school board officials. Why they teach despite it all . The negotiations have taken place behind closed doors. Publicly, the past week has been marked by sometimes biting remarks, as well as vocal picketing in and around the city's schools, some of which opened for a few hours each weekday to give some students a place to go during the strike. Both sides indicated Friday that they'd reached a tentative agreement, though teachers union leaders stressed then that any decision to end the strike or not would be determined this weekend. Lewis, from the teachers union, said that one problem is that ""there's no trust"" of school board members. Delegates found several elements of the contract problematic, with the union president calling job security chief among them. ""The big elephant in the room is the closing of 200 schools,"" Lewis said. ""(Union members) are concerned about this city's decision on some level to close schools."" It was not immediately clear where Lewis got the 200 figure or when she believes such school closures might happen. But Marielle Sainvilus, a spokeswoman for Chicago Public Schools, called Lewis' claim ""false,"" asserting that union leaders said a few days ago that 100 schools would close, and ""I'm sure it'll be another number tomorrow."" ""All Ms. Lewis is trying to do is distract away from the fact that she and her leadership are using our kids as pawns in this process,"" Sainvilus told CNN by e-mail. Another point of contention involves the teacher evaluation system, Lewis said. The tentative contract would change it for first time since 1967, taking into account ""student growth (for the) first time,"" according to the school system. And those teachers who are rated as ""unsatisfactory and developing"" could potentially be laid off. A parent on the impact of the strike . Principals would keep ""full authority"" to hire teachers, and the school system will now have hiring standards for those with credentials beyond a teacher certification. In addition, ""highly rated teachers"" who lost their jobs when their schools were closed can ""follow their students to the consolidated school,"" according to a summary of the proposed contract from Chicago Public Schools. This contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school-age students, 10 more ""instructional days"" each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system, as opposed to the two schedules now in place, depending on the school. The pay structure would change with a 3% pay hike for the first year of the contract, 2% for the second year and 2% for the third year. If a trigger extends the contract to four years, teachers would get a 3% pay increase. Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days, health insurance contribution rates will be frozen and the ""enhanced pension program"" is being eliminated. As is, the median base salary for teachers in the Chicago public schools in 2011 was $67,974, according to the system's annual financial report. With the strike now continuing, the school system plans to open 147 ""Children First"" sites citywide Monday for students to go to, in addition to programs run by the city's park department and neighborhood organizations, Chicago Board of Education President David Vitale said. But Vitale said that he, like the mayor, is ""extremely disappointed"" that such programs are necessary. He noted that classes began, for some students, on August 13 and that he didn't understand why they couldn't continue as work continues to finalize a contract deal. ""There is no reason why our kids cannot be in school while the union reviews the agreement,"" Vitale said. For high school athletes, strike could put scholarships on the line .

"London (CNN) -- The scandal that brought down Britain's biggest Sunday newspaper widened Monday with allegations that journalists from other News International papers improperly obtained personal information about former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Brown expressed dismay at the allegations Monday night and has given investigators ""all relevant evidence"" he has about the matter, according to a statement from his office. ""The family has been shocked by the level of criminality and the unethical means by which personal details have been obtained,"" the statement said. ""The matter is in police hands."" The latest accusations of wrongdoing by journalists working for News International papers were published by rival outlet the Guardian on Monday. The Guardian said the tabloid The Sun -- the country's best-selling daily newspaper -- obtained details about Brown's seriously ill son and published a story about him, while people working for the upmarket Sunday Times tricked the former Labour Party leader's accountants into handing over financial details. The efforts dated back some 10 years, and include periods when Brown was prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, according to the Guardian. News International, the British subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corporation, issued a statement saying it was aware of the allegations. ""So that we can investigate these matters further, we ask that all information concerning these allegations is provided to us,"" the company's statement read. And Brown's wife, Sarah, responded in a post on her Twitter account. ""So sad to learn all I am about my family's privacy -- it is very personal and really hurtful if all true,"" the post read. The latest allegations follow Sunday's closure of the News of the World over other allegations of illegal breach of privacy. The decision to pull the plug on the 168-year-old paper came amid accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities, as well as claims it may have bribed police officers. Police said Thursday they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone-hacking. The widening scandal and public outrage over it threaten to scuttle plans by Murdoch to create Britain's largest media company by acquiring satellite broadcaster BSkyB. U.K. Media Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced Monday in Parliament that he was referring the proposed sale to the Competition Commission for a thorough review. ""I know that colleagues on all sides of this house and the public at home feel very concerned at the prospect of the organization which allegedly allowed these terrible things to happen being allowed to take control of what would become Britain's biggest media company,"" Hunt said. The company said Monday that it was withdrawing its plan to sell television channel Sky News as part of its acquisition of BSkyB pending further consideration of the bid. British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Murdoch to reconsider the acquisition in light of public ""revulsion"" over the scandal. Earlier Monday, London's Metropolitan Police angrily blasted leaks from its investigation into illegal eavesdropping by News of the World, hours after British media reported that the paper tried to bribe royal protection officers to get private phone numbers for members of the royal family. Police said News International had shared information about alleged efforts by reporters to bribe police, and that both sides had agreed to keep the information confidential. Police said they were ""extremely concerned and disappointed"" at the leaks, which they said ""could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation."" Police, the royal family and News International all refused to answer CNN questions about allegations that a reporter sought company money to pay a royal protection officer for the confidential details about the royal family. BBC business editor Robert Peston claimed Monday that News of the World e-mails showed former royal correspondent Clive Goodman ""was requesting cash from the newspaper's editor, Andy Coulson, to buy a confidential directory of the royal family's landline telephone numbers, and all the phone numbers -- including mobiles -- of the household staff."" Goodman was sent to prison in 2007 for illegally intercepting royal family voice mails. Coulson insisted he knew nothing about the crime, but resigned as editor because it happened on his watch. Coulson went on to become communications director for David Cameron, now Britain's Conservative prime minister, but resigned from that post earlier this year because of fallout from the phone-hacking scandal. He was questioned by police on Friday and released on bail until October. The controversy continued despite the shuttering of the News of the World. Murdoch has not apologized to the family of a murdered British teenage girl whose phone messages were illegally intercepted, a lawyer for the girl's family said Monday. Rebekah Brooks, who was editor of the newspaper at the time 13-year-old murder victim Milly Dowler's phone was hacked, should resign, Dowler family lawyer Mark Lewis also said. ""She should do the honorable thing,"" Lewis said. ""She was editor at the time Milly was taken. She should take editorial responsibility"" for the actions of her journalists, he said. Brooks has since been promoted to chief executive of News International, and Murdoch has stood by her so far. She may be questioned by police about the scandal in the coming weeks, a News International source told CNN Monday. The source emphasized that Brooks would be interviewed as a witness, not a suspect, if police do question her, and rejected British press reports that the questioning would take place Monday. The source asked not to be named discussing internal company business. Dowler's mother and sister met with Clegg on Monday, keeping the scandal in the public eye. They are due to sit down with Labour leader Ed Miliband on Tuesday and with Cameron on Wednesday, Lewis said. Clegg also said: ""We owe it to the Dowlers"" to get the bottom of what happened. The News of the World struck a wistful yet proud tone in its final editorial Sunday, and repeated its owner's apology for the criminal activities that brought the paper down. ""Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is truly sorry,"" it said in an unsigned piece. ""There is no justification for this appalling wrongdoing."" The paper welcomed Cameron's call for two inquiries, one into how police investigated the allegations of phone hacking and one into the ethics and standards of British journalists. Separately, police are already conducting their second investigation into the hacking itself. Downing Street on Saturday confirmed that Cameron has approached the head of the judiciary of England and Wales to suggest names for the judge to lead the inquiry into the hacking allegations. Murdoch flew into London Sunday, hours after the final edition of the News of the World hit the stands. The publication was the first British national paper Murdoch bought, in 1969, as he began to propel himself from Australian newspaper proprietor to international media magnate. With its closure, News International now owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corporation also encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers.

"(CNN) -- Alabama officials Monday asked the full 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to reinstate portions of a tough law targeting illegal immigrants after a three-judge panel blocked those provisions. ""We are filing this based on principle,"" Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the move. ""As the governor of Alabama, I have a duty to uphold and defend Alabama law. Federal courts should not restrain state governments in a way that is contrary to the U.S. Constitution."" The Obama administration took Alabama to court over the law, arguing that the legislation and a similar act in Georgia law encroached on federal authority. Undocumented immigrants face arrest as they proclaim, 'No papers, no fear' The judges blocked parts of the Alabama law in August, including language that makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work or solicit work; imposed criminal penalties to hide ""an alien"" or rent property to anyone in the United States illegally; and required state officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools. The judges let stand one of the most controversial portions of the law, allowing local and state police check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. The ruling followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld a similar law in Arizona despite a federal challenge. Mary Bauer, the legal director for the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center, called the law ""illegal and immoral"" and said the center was confident the judges' ruling would stand. ""We are disappointed that the state is continuing to stand behind this unjust and hateful law, which has brought so much shame and ridicule upon the state,"" Bauer said in a written statement.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Four people face criminal charges in connection with the sinking of a Russian ship Sunday in which scores of people died, federal investigators said Tuesday. Both Svetlana Inyakina, general director of Argorechtur, the company that rented the cruise boat ""Bulgaria,"" and Yakov Ivashov, a manager at the Kama River Register, have been detained, Russia's Investigative Committee said. They are charged with providing services that do not meet safety standards which resulted in multiple deaths, and if convicted could be jailed for up to 10 years. Criminal charges are also being brought against the captains of two ships which are accused of passing the sinking boat without stopping to help the people in the water, the committee said. They could face heavy fines or up to three years in prison. At least 116 people died in the accident, the committee said on its website. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said it has recovered 90 bodies so far -- of 60 women, 16 children and 14 men. Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin, who is also head of the special government commission investigating the accident, said 22 people were buried Tuesday, and more are expected in the coming days. Divers will search around the clock until all of the victims are found, said Levitin.  Recovery efforts will also include small planes conducting reconnaissance flights as far as 80 miles downstream, the minister said. According to Russian state TV, scuba divers are working underwater in low visibility and against a heavy current that is moving the boat, which is lying at the bottom of the river. Earlier Tuesday, divers broke through to an inner room where a children's karaoke concert was taking place when the boat capsized, emergency officials said. Officials believe dozens of children were trapped in the recreation room Sunday when the ""Bulgaria"" sank on the Volga river in the Russian republic of Tatarstan with about 200 people on board. There are 175 scuba divers working on the scene, the ministry said. Russia is observing a day of mourning Tuesday with church services taking place all across the country, flags flying at half-staff and national television canceling all entertainment programming in the wake of what Russian media are calling the most devastating river accident in the country's history. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the federal government would pay 1 million rubles ($35,500) to the families of each of the dead. He also promised 400,000 rubles ($14,250) to those who suffered major and moderately severe injuries, and half that sum to people with minor injuries. Among the bodies to have been recovered are those of the ship's captain Alexander Ostrovsky and his wife, local officials in Tatarstan told Russian media at the site of the accident. Russian Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said the lifting of the boat will start late afternoon Saturday. At least 79 people have been rescued, some of whom have been released from hospitals after receiving medical treatment, according to government agencies. The ship did not have a license to transport passengers, was overloaded, and was last repaired more than 30 years ago, the Russian Prosecutor's Office said Monday. Prosecutors also established that the left engine of the ship was damaged, they said on their website. Russian state TV reported the vessel had an operational limit of about 150 passengers, citing a top government official on site. State TV also reported, citing law enforcement officials, that there were life vests on board for only 156 people. The Investigative Committee said Tuesday there were 192 people aboard the boat -- 148 passengers, plus 44 staff and their relatives. Shoigu said earlier there were 208 people aboard the ship, of whom 25 passengers were not officially registered and didn't have tickets. RIA Novosti reported that 205 people were on board. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said it was evident from the information gathered so far ""that the vessel was not in the appropriate condition."" ""We have to establish why the owner of the ship operated a ship that was in such a poor technical condition,"" Medvedev said.  ""It is clear that such an accident couldn't have taken place if safety rules were followed, even despite the difficult weather situation."" He also called for ""a total inspection of all public carriers in Russia,"" adding that it is ""obvious that this ship was not the only one with issues. ""The number of old tubs that are now in use (in Russia) is just staggering,"" the president said. He instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to investigate everyone involved in the Bulgaria cruise, including ""ship-owners, those who issued the navigation permit and those who were involved in organizing that boat tour, especially given the large number of children aboard."" Authorities have not ruled out the possibility that some passengers could have survived by swimming to the bank or one of the islands in the Volga. Survivors told Russian state TV that there were many children on board the ship. The ferry was built in 1955 in what used to be Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials. RIA Novosti said the double-deck cruise ship went down near the village of Syukeyevo in Tatarstan, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the city of Kazan. Kazan is about 724 kilometers (450 miles) east of Moscow. CNN's Arkady Irshenko contributed to this report.","The criminal charges brought against four people over the sinking carry heavy penalties .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- With a short statement, China's tallest superstar Wednesday made it official that he has quit playing basketball, after weeks of intense media speculation on his future. ""I will end my athletic career and formally retire from the game of basketball,"" Yao Ming, who turns 31 in September, told a packed press conference in his hometown. The Shanghai native, who stands at 7 feet and 6 inches (2.29 meters), blamed persistent injuries for cutting short his decorated career on the court. ""At the end of last year, I once again had a stress fracture in my left foot and had to sit out of basketball,"" he said. ""Since then, like many friends who cared about me, I waited and hoped that I could return."" China bids farewell to Yao . The nicknamed ""Little Giant"" was signed by the Houston Rockets in 2002 as the top overall pick of the National Basketball Association in North America. Since then Yao has scored an average of 19 points per game and been voted an NBA All-Star player eight times, turning himself to one of the most successful overseas players in the league. Over the past two years, however, foot and ankle injuries forced him to miss the 2009-2010 season and sit out most of last season after only five games. Despite the recent setback, the former Houston Rockets center made a special point in English about thanking his adopted hometown. ""Nine years ago, I came to Houston as a young, tall, skinny player,"" he said. ""The entire city and the team changed me to a grown man -- not only as a basketball player but also I had my daughter there."" Yao's one-year-old daughter Amy, smiling at a wall of flashing cameras, almost outshone her famous father when the whole family -- including Yao's wife and parents -- took center stage. Her potential birthplace was a contentious topic in China last year, as supporters debated the implications of their hero, who had led the national team into world championships and the Olympics, becoming the father of an American citizen. At the press event, amid high praises from sports officials, Yao fielded the rapid-fire questions from journalists -- ranging from his most memorable game to his daughter's first ""Daddy"" -- with his usual brevity and dry humor. ""On earth,"" he responded when a local reporter asked him where he planned to live in retirement. Now the owner of his former club, Shanghai Sharks, Yao depicted a busy post-retirement schedule filled with work involving coaching, charity and commerce (too busy to help improve the Netherlands' national team, as suggested by a Dutch reporter). He also appealed to Chinese fans to continue watching basketball, amid worries that his departure would diminish the nation's interest in the game. The NBA franchise has made huge inroads in China thanks to Yao's popularity. The league paid Yao $93 million during his nine-year career. He also has earned an estimated $25 million in endorsement deals for local products as well as global brands such as Apple, McDonald's and Visa. To his admirers, however, Yao's multifaceted role as a sport star, national idol and cultural ambassador simply makes him invaluable. Hong Nanli was the only journalist allowed on stage when she presented Yao with a special gift: A large print of a photograph chosen from several thousand she had taken of him since he was a teenage athlete. ""I was his fan even before he became a star,"" said the 73-year-old sports photographer for the Oriental Sports Daily newspaper. ""When I learned about his retirement, I felt a sense of loss -- we won't see the 'Little Giant' on the court again."" The star himself sounded more optimistic -- and a bit philosophical -- when CNN asked him: When are we going to see next Yao Ming in the NBA? ""I followed somebody's footprints -- Chinese players in the league ahead of me,"" he said. ""It's always taking some legacy from older players -- you get it, you gain experience from that and make your own success."" ""I believe in the future there will be more Chinese players following our footprints and moving even further.""","Yao told a packed press conference that he'll end his athletic career .

""You feel the rejuvenation,"" the 19-year Chrysler worker says of the mood inside the Sterling Stamping plant and in the busy restaurants and other businesses near the Chrysler and GM factories. ""Yes, we have a future."" He wasn't so sure in 2009 when Chrysler was teetering on the verge of collapse and Cefali for the first time had to file for unemployment benefits. He told his wife to prepare to move and began searching for work in Texas or Tennessee. Then help came from Washington. Romney, Obama both seeking advantages as campaign rolls on . ""Do you think you are working today because of President Obama?"" I asked Cefali on Wednesday at his local United Auto Workers hall across the street from the stamping plant. ""Yes,"" he said without hesitation. ""If he didn't come through and give that vote and say, 'Yes we have got to save Chrysler. We have to save GM. We've got to do this,' all this Sterling Heights would have been gone, would have been dead."" Support from union auto workers like Cefali is an advantage for the president in Michigan, a state Republican Mitt Romney had hoped to turn into a battleground. A new CNN/ORC International poll shows Obama leading by eight points, 52%-44%, among likely voters in Michigan. Romney and Obama split the suburban vote statewide and run even among independents. But the president leads by 11 points among women, by 54%-41% among Michigan voters from union households, and by 56%-43% in the critical Detroit suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties. Both counties are dominated by the auto industry, and Romney went to high school in Oakland County. ""I don't think he is one of us... a Michigander,"" Cefali says of Romney. ""He doesn't really relate to the working class."" Barbara VanSyckel disagrees, yet she concedes that perception is widespread. ""He is a self-made man,"" says VanSyckel, the chairwoman of the Macomb County Republican Party. ""I don't understand why people don't see that as much."" VanSyckel says Romney's experience is perfect for the challenges of the moment, and she says her county's recent phone bank work and neighborhood canvassing gives her a measure of hope. ""I believe we still can win,"" VanSyckel said Wednesday. ""People are interested in what you can do about the economy here."" Michigan is clearly in better shape, but hardly humming. Romney's remarks: Huge mistake or plain truth? The unemployment rate is 9% - above the national average. But it is down from the 11.3% it was when Obama took office. Michigan has added 57,500 manufacturing jobs during the Obama presidency -- 34,000 of those in the auto industry. While the numbers might suggest to some a potential Romney opening, the trend line is helping the incumbent. ""The economy is on an upward slope even though the magnitude of the slope is very small,"" University of Michigan communications and political science professor Michael Traugott said. ""Barack Obama also has a reservoir of popular support or sentiment about him personally and views about how he cares for other Americans that he can take advantage of."" VanSyckel said the president's image advantage is, in her view, the obstacle to Romney making Michigan more of a battleground. Poll shows voters' reaction to Romney tapes . ""I think he is not making himself look as real as when I have gone to his rallies,"" she says. ""He is pretty down to earth when you meet him. I don't think he comes across much that way when you see him on television. ""He has been around it long enough. I think he needs to relax a little bit,"" VanSyckel said. ""Romney needs to differentiate himself. I think the philosophies are different enough. But people also want to vote for someone they like, and for some reason they don't seem to connect with Romney the way they do with Obama."" Romney's son Tagg will visit Macomb County next week, and VanSyckel says she was told both Romney and running mate Paul Ryan will return to the state. But there are no firm dates, and Republicans here are well aware the Romney campaign is not spending any money on television advertising. ""Are we getting brushed off?"" is how VanSyckel publicly phrased the question many Michigan Republicans are asking privately. Those party activists were upset when the John McCain camp pulled out four years ago. VanSyckel said Romney's local roots mean activists like her ""are going to work harder for him"" and she hopes to get firmer commitments from the national campaign soon. ""Doable,"" she said of the prospects for a Romney comeback here. But she then added: ""We're getting pretty tight on time. I look forward to hearing something soon.""

"New York (CNN) -- Longtime New York Yankees icon Derek Jeter underwent surgery Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina, to mend the left ankle he fractured fielding a ground ball in the 12th inning of what was the beginning of his team's post-season collapse. The Bombers' captain is expected to recover within four to five months, according to a team spokesman. But the injury has only added to looming questions about how many more seasons the aging all-star has left in pinstripes. Finishing off the year with 216 hits, the most in baseball, the 38-year-old shortstop -- nicknamed ""Mr. November"" -- has played 18 seasons in Gotham and has often said he would like to finish his career as a Yankee. A virtual shoo-in for Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame, Jeter last year became only the 28th player in baseball history -- and the first Yankee -- to reach the 3,000-hit mark. News of Saturday's surgery also coincided with the birthday of another Bombers legend: Mickey Mantle, who played 18 seasons with the team between 1951 and 1968. But when Jeter will join the list of past Yankee greats remains a mystery that most New Yorkers aren't looking to unravel just yet. ""We've had to move on from a lot of things this year,"" said Manager Joe Girardi in a postgame press conference following the team's 6-4 loss to Detroit last weekend. ""We've lost the greatest closer of all time where people left us for dead. ... It is something you deal with, an aging roster."" In March, pitcher Mariano Rivera -- the 42-year-old Panama native who has long endeared himself to New Yorkers with his signature cut fastball -- was faced with the daunting prospect of a career-ending injury with a tear to his anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL. Rivera, baseball's all-time leading career saves leader (608), hit the dirt in agony while shagging fly balls during a practice session in Kansas City, leaving the Yankees to fill his shoes with a younger though surprisingly proficient pitching staff. ""If you want to move on, you've got to find a way,"" Girardi said. But the Tigers on Thursday swept the Yanks, whose hitters largely struggled throughout the post-season with a measly .188 playoff batting average, raising questions about the team's penchant for aging stars and amplifying calls to develop the next generation of Yankee greats.","The Bombers' captain is expected to recover within 4-5 months, according to a team spokesman .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Jordan's intelligence department foiled ""a major terrorist plot"" that targeted ""shopping centers, residential areas, diplomats and foreign nationals"" in Jordan, the country's state news agency reported Sunday.

The terrorists called their plan ""9/11 (2),"" suggesting it was set to happen on the seventh anniversary of the last al Qaeda attack in Jordan when suicide bombs exploded in an Amman hotel November 9, 2005, the report said. The plot, which was in the preliminary stages, involved ""a group of 11 terrorists associated with the ideology of al Qaeda,"" Petra reported. All 11 suspects are Jordanian citizens who moved in and out of Syria, government spokesman Samih al-Maaytah said on state television Sunday. ""The group had intended to take advantage of what they believed was the Intelligence 'preoccupation' with other files, to carry out their plans,"" Petra reported. The plans included ""using explosives, booby-trapped cars as well as submachine guns and mortars,"" it said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A leader of the so-called ""Bling Ring"" that burglarized celebrity homes in Los Angeles was sentenced Tuesday to four years in prison, a prosecutor said. Rachel Lee, 21, was sentenced for burglarizing two years ago the home of reality star Audrina Patridge of ""The Hills,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Chris Baker said. Lee allegedly took more than $25,000 in jewelry, designer luggage, clothes, shoes, boots and watches from Patridge's home on Feb. 23, 2009. She pleaded no contest last month to one count of first-degree residential burglary. In his sentencing Tuesday, Judge Larry Paul Fidler dismissed one felony count of conspiracy to commit burglary and two counts of receiving stolen property against Lee, prosecutors said. Lee's restitution will be determined at a later date, authorities said. The remaining four defendants -- Nicholas Prugo, 20; Diana Tamayo, 21; Courtney Leigh Ames, 20; and Roy Lopez Jr., 29 -- will be back in court on November 18 for motions and pretrial hearings, prosecutors said. The ring is accused of allegedly taking more than $3 million in jewelry, designer clothes and accessories from the homes of Orlando Bloom, Paris Hilton, Brian Austin-Green and Megan Fox, Lindsay Lohan and Patridge between September 2008 and August 2009, prosecutors said. The four remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty, prosecutors said. Lohan's home was burglarized on August 2009, and an estimated $128,000 in jewelry, designer clothes and accessories was taken, authorities said. Authorities said they believe an obsession with celebrity culture -- and breaking inside their homes and wearing their clothing -- could be the motivation for the alleged crimes. The group targeted celebrities such as actress Rachel Bilson, police said, because it was known she had a large collection of Chanel. They allegedly studied celebrity magazines to pick out the clothing and jewelry that they wanted, and would then use the Internet to study satellite maps of the victim's home before deciding on the best method for entry, police said. At first, police treated them as separate incidents, but after reviewing surveillance video from Patridge and Lohan's homes, they began to notice several similarities and realized that the incidents were related. ""There's nothing to suggest that these kids were criminal masterminds -- this wasn't an 'Ocean's 11' caper,"" Los Angeles Police Department Officer Brett Goodkin told CNN in 2009. ""It's really a series of quite run-of-the-mill residential burglaries, except they targeted the victims for who they are.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Panasonic halted operations at three factories in China after angry protesters ransacked Japanese businesses over the weekend amid rising tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea. Violence against Japanese companies was seen in Xi'an, Dongguan, Changsha and Guangzhou, according to local media reports. A Panasonic factory was set on fire and a Toyota dealership in Qingdao were damaged on Saturday, and a Jusco department store was ransacked. In Guangzhou, demonstrators broke into the Garden Hotel and attacked a Japanese restaurant on the second floor, according to the South China Morning Press. Panasonic has suspended work at three plants in China until Tuesday, after factories in Qingdao and Suzhou were damaged by protesters, company officials told CNN. Panasonic also halted operations at a factory in Guangdong province until Tuesday as some local employees staged a strike as protest against Japan's claim to the island chain, called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan. Background: How remote rock split China, Japan . A Heiwado Co. department store in Changsha was ransacked, as were Japanese supermarkets in several cities, Japan's Kyodo News Service reported. ""The Sino-Japanese economic war has officially begun,"" Chinese economist Wang Fuzhong wrote on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site. ""I hope it won't end in a situation where everyone loses."" The Japan tourism industry, which has been struggling after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, is being hit by the dispute, after calls in China for tourists to stop visiting Japan. The head of a hotel at the foot of Mount Fuji told CNN that cancellations from Chinese tourists -- which make up ""about 30% to 40%"" of his business -- are stacking up. ""China is a big market for us, it would be very damaging for us to see a decline of the Chinese tourists,"" said the man, who gave his surname as Watanabe. A Chinese tour guide on the streets of Ginza shopping district in Tokyo told CNN that in the six years she's worked in Japan this situation ""is the worst of her career."" ""I do not expect much of the tours (from China) coming back from now. Most of tours were cancelled,"" said the guide, who asked CNN to use her Japanese name Mitsu Matsumoto for fear of reprisals. ""I want them (China and Japan) to be friendly again. Otherwise tour agents are going to bankrupt and tour guides like us will be affected badly,"" Matsumoto said. ""I wish the issue will be solved soon."" Chinese state media, reporting on the protests, decried the violence. Even hawkish publications, such as Global Times -- which ran an editorial ""Discard illusion of friendly ties with Japan"" last week -- published an editorial Monday headlined ""Violence is never appropriate solution."" Meanwhile, an editorial in the China Daily on Monday called on China to impose economic sanctions against Japan. ""Taking a cue from the U.S. practice, China can use the security exception clause to reduce the export of some important materials to Japan,"" the editorial said. On Thursday last week a Chinese official warned that Tokyo's move to ""buy"" a disputed island chain in the East China Sea would hurt trade between Asia's two largest economies. The battle over ownership of the island chain will ""inevitably"" have a negative impact on Sino-Japan economic ties, Vice Minister of Commerce Jiang Zengwei said Thursday, state-run Xinhua reported. The islands sit among popular fishing waters and are also believed to be rich in oil resources. Ownership of the chain would allow exclusive commercial rights to the seas surrounding the islands. Despite booming auto sales in China, sales of Japanese car brands are down 2% in China compared to a year ago, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Meanwhile, sales of car brands from other foreign countries, including Germany, the U.S., South Korea and France, are up 25%, 19%, 12% and 4% respectively. Luo Lei, deputy secretary-general of China Automobile Dealers Association, said earlier this week that Toyota purchases have fallen 15% while Mazda sales are down 6% year over year. Tensions between China and Japan -- the world's second and third largest economies, respectively -- escalated on Friday as Chinese surveillance vessels entered the disputed area to begin patrols and ""law enforcement,"" according to Chinese state-run media. China dispatched the ships after the Japanese government bought several of the islands from a private Japanese owner last week. The Chinese vessels entered Japan's territorial waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard, said Shinichi Gega, a spokesman for Japan's 11th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Tokyo would ""take all possible measures to ensure security"" of the islands, located between Okinawa and Taiwan. China is Japan's largest trading partner. Nearly 20% of Japanese exports last year were sold to mainland China, compared to 15.3% exported to the U.S., according to figures from the Japan External Trade Organization. Last week, the Japanese government approved the purchase for 2.05 billion yen ($26.2 million) the group of small islands from the Kurihara family, a private Japanese owner, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura. China says its claim to the islands goes back hundreds of years. Japan formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after World War II. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.

"FALLS CHURCH, Virginia (CNN)  -- Michelle Mack has turned medical thinking upside down. The right side of Michelle Mack's brain rewired itself to take over functions controlled by the left. Born with only half a brain, Mack can speak normally, graduated from high school and has an uncanny knack for dates. At 27, doctors determined that the right side of her brain had essentially rewired itself to make up for function that was likely lost during a pre-birth stroke. But her childhood and young adult years were fraught with frustration. ""It was very hard for me,"" Mack said. ""It was very hard for me growing up. No one knew the truth about my brain."" Mack's parents, Carol and Wally, realized shortly after her birth that something was wrong. ""There wasn't a group to turn to,"" said Carol Mack. ""Michelle didn't have cerebral palsy, I knew that. She didn't have Down's syndrome, I knew that. I had no place to turn."" Ten years ago, Dr. Jordan Grafman, chief of the Cognitive Neuroscience Section at the National Institutes of Health, finally diagnosed the problem.  Watch how Mack's brain healed itself » . An MRI scan revealed she was missing nearly all the left side of her brain. While it was clear Mack has some problems, Grafman said he and the family were shocked by the extent of the damage. ""We were surprised to see the extent of the lesion in her brain, which basically took away the left side of her brain,"" said Grafman. ""There's some very deep structures remaining, but the surface of her brain, the cortex is 95 percent gone and some of the deeper structures, structures that control movement, are missing. These are all structures that are important for movement, behavior, cognition."" The only answer, Grafman said, was that Mack's brain has rewired itself. The remaining half took over some of the essential functions that are normally done by the left, such as speaking and reading. That rewiring, however, came at a cost. ""Michelle has fairly normal language abilities, certainly basic language abilities, she can construct a sentence, she can understand instructions, she can find words when she's talking, but actually she has some trouble in some aspects of visual-spatial processing,"" said Grafman. ""It's quite possible that in her learning, in her development, when the right hemisphere either took over or developed some of the language abilities that it cost her in some of the skills that are normally mediated by the right side of the brain,"" added Grafman. In the 10 years since Grafman first diagnosed Mack, she has seen some intellectual functions improve, the doctor said. Recovery has not been perfect, however. Mack still struggles with abstract concepts and becomes easily lost in unfamiliar surroundings. The diagnosis explained why Mack had experienced a lifetime of difficulty controlling her emotions. ""He's helped us understand the reason why I tend to throw fits, temper tantrums,"" she said. ""It was because I was missing half my brain."" Mack will always have some problems, but dad Wally Mack said that Grafman's diagnosis and treatment answered a lot of questions and gave him hope. ""Dr. Grafman explained that the right hemisphere is taking over, and it might take her a little while longer to get there with all the rewiring that has to take place,"" he said. ""But that told us all these bad days are behind us and there are nothing but good days ahead."" Michelle Mack is now 37 and lives with her mother and father. She works from home doing data entry for her church. She is fairly independent, pays rent and can do most household chores. She realizes she'll need help for the rest of her life but wanted to tell her story to make it clear that she is not helpless. ""I wanted to do this so people like producers, photographers and security guards and police officers learn about people like me,"" she said, ""that I'm normal but have special needs, and that there are a lot people like me, so that they could be more understanding."" CNN's Campbell Brown contributed to this report.","Doctor: Lesion ""basically took away the left side"" of Michelle Mack's brain .

"(CNN) -- Left-leaning Ollanta Humala won the Peruvian presidential runoff Monday, ending a hard-fought campaign during which he promised to spread the benefits of Peru's economic boom to the poor. Though vote-counting continued, his opponent, Keiko Fujimori, conceded defeat, according to state news. Humala had previously claimed victory at a nighttime rally in downtown Lima on Sunday. ""The nation will only advance if the Peruvian family advances,"" he said to throngs of cheering supporters in the city's Dos de Mayo square. He vowed to create a unity government and said he would focus on helping the country's most vulnerable. Humala also addressed the need to improve the nation's infrastructure, water, sanitation and education, particularly in rural areas. Those were promises he had made repeatedly throughout the campaign that set Humala, an ex-army officer, against Fujimori, a right-wing lawmaker and the daughter of a former president who is currently in prison on a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses. With more than 90% of ballots counted Monday, Humala had 51.5% of the vote, versus Fujimori's 48.5%, according to the county's official electoral body. His all-but-certain victory earlier in the day sent shocks through Peru's stock market. It closed early Monday after its general index fell more than 12.5% -- its biggest one-day drop ever. Mining stocks, in particular, suffered. ""This activity in the market is directly linked to the electoral process. Trust (in the new government) seems to be the issue,"" said Daniel Romero, a financial analyst at Sociedad Agente de Bolsa in Lima. ""The selling is being led mostly by foreign investors,"" he added. ""They're the most sensitive because they don't know what has been going on politically here in Peru."" Romero urged Humala to move quickly in naming a new finance minister after he takes office on July 28 . For months, the candidacy of Humala, a past ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, has made some investors uneasy. They fear he could introduce higher taxes and redirect policies that have helped to push economic growth. In a recent interview with CNN en Espanol, Humala denied his goal was a Chavez-style social revolution in Peru. ""When we speak about revolution, we're speaking about a revolution in education, which is something fundamental,"" Humala said. ""We have to build our own future. We believe that the Venezuelan model doesn't apply in Peru."" Pollsters in Peru had said Sunday that Humala looked likely to win the presidency, and election officials said the partial results were somewhat skewed in favor of Lima and other urban areas. Rural regions, where Humala was expected to perform best, were slower to report. The runoff election was a face-off between two candidates with little in common. Humala, 48, narrowly lost a 2006 election bid, in part because many saw him as a close ally of Venezuela's Chavez, intent on turning the country to the left. That's a point his rival, 36-year-old Fujimori, hammered on throughout her campaign. At a closing rally last week in Paseo Colon, a historic avenue in the capital Lima, Fujimori went on the offensive as she addressed a crowd of thousands. ""There are recordings and witnesses that prove that this gentleman is a good soldier of Chavez,"" she said to cheering crowds. ""I am not going to allow other countries to interfere in the sovereignty of our country. I'm going to defend it!"" Humala, a former army officer linked to a 2000 military uprising, has tried to distance himself from such perceptions, swapping his trademark red T-shirts for suits. Like her opponent, Fujimori was forced to answer uncomfortable questions about her past during this year's election. She is the daughter of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is currently in prison on a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes. Many Peruvians credit the elder Fujimori with defeating insurgencies that ravaged the South American nation for years and for enacting economic reforms that stabilized the Peruvian economy. However, he is also criticized for corruption, having an authoritarian streak and the widespread rights abuses that were committed under his watch. During the campaign, protesters accused his daughter of planning to grant the former president amnesty if she won, as she said she might do in a 2008 interview. She later backed away from those remarks. Centrist candidates, including former President Alejandro Toledo, former Lima Mayor Luis Castaneda and former Finance Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, cannibalized each others' votes during the first round of voting in April. In that round, Humala garnered more than 30% of the vote, while Fujimori ended slightly above 23%. Under Peruvian law, only the top two contenders advance to a second round. After the elimination of the more centrist candidates in April, Peru's 2010 Nobel literary laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, a former presidential candidate himself, described the race as a choice between ""terminal cancer and AIDS."" Andrea Stiglich, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit team of Latin American analysts, said the election was a triumph of extremes. ""This election was meant to be the election of a centrist policy continuity candidate, and what we have is a first round that has yielded a result between two extremes in the left and the right,"" she said before the second-round vote. Current Peruvian President Alan Garcia was not permitted to run for a consecutive term. ""I will get behind whoever wins,"" he said on Sunday before voting closed. ""The task (of running the country) is not easy and they (will) need everyone's support."" The new president will face many of the same challenges Garcia did: Persistent poverty, protests around the rights to natural resources and violence from remnants of a leftist insurgency that helped to make Peru the world's largest producer of coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine. On the eve of the election, five soldiers were killed in an attack in the country's southern province of Cusco, state news said. They were reportedly on their way to provide local police with additional security for the election when they were ambushed.

"(CNN) -- The head of Japan's major opposition party and favorite to become the nation's next prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited a controversial shrine Wednesday in a move likely to ratchet up already heightened tensions with China. The visit comes as the nations are locked in a dispute over a remote island chain in the East China Sea. The story behind the islands dispute . In recent weeks, the Chinese navy has been flexing its muscles in the region, sending warships to the waters near the islands. Seven were seen in the area Wednesday, according to Japan's Defense Ministry. Past visits by Japanese prime ministers and other political leaders to Yasukuni Shrine, where 14 of Japan's Class-A war criminals are enshrined with thousands of Japanese soldiers, have ignited a firestorm of controversy with China as well as North Korea and South Korea. The shrine is regarded by the nations as a symbol of Japan's imperial military past. All three countries suffered under Japan's military aggression in World War II. Responding to a question about the visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Wednesday that Japan should abide by its promises and handle controversial issues responsibly, the state-run Xinhua news service reported.

In September, the Japanese government bought the disputed islands -- known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China and Taiwan -- from the Japanese family that owned them for 2.05 billion yen (U.S. $26.2 million). China says its claim to the islands goes back hundreds of years and feels Japan is trying to undermine its sovereignty. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so it formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Abe, a former prime minister, is the head of the opposition Liberal Democrats, who are expected to win a majority of seats in the next elections.

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip was released from a hospital in Scotland on Monday after being treated for a bladder infection. Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland on Wednesday. The 91-year-old, who first suffered the problem in June, fell ill again as he was staying at the royal residence in Balmoral, Scotland, where the queen traditionally spends part of the summer. UK's Prince William helps save girl from drowning . Buckingham Palace said Wednesday he had been taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure and was likely to be kept in for several days. It is the third time Philip has been hospitalized in the past eight months. Before the bladder infection, which he initially contracted during events marking the queen's diamond jubilee, he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery. However, he appeared in good health last week as he fulfilled several engagements on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. Philip's next scheduled public appearance is alongside the queen as she opens the London 2012 Paralympic Games on August 29. He appeared by her side at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games at the end of July and accompanied her on a visit to the Olympic Park as the events got under way. It has been a particularly busy year for the queen and Duke of Edinburgh because of the many events held to celebrate her diamond jubilee. Addressing Parliament in March, the queen paid tribute to her husband as ""a constant strength and guide"" throughout her long reign. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. Born the prince of Greece and Denmark on the Greek island of Corfu in 1921, Philip left Greece with his family when he was 18 months old after King Constantine was forced to abdicate the throne following a revolution. The family moved to Paris and then to England in 1928. Philip also went to school in Germany. Philip renounced his Greek title when he became a naturalized British subject in 1947.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother and four of his siblings announced Monday a tribute concert for the late pop singer to be held in Wales in October, but the lineup for talent is still a secret. Brothers Marlon, Tito and Jackie, sister La Toya and family matriarch Katherine Jackson attended the ""Michael Forever The Tribute Concert"" announcement at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Monday morning. But the announcement exposed a major rift among members of the Jackson family, especially with Jackson brothers Jermaine and Randy, who did not attend the news conference. They objected to the show because it's scheduled to happen during the criminal trial of the doctor accused in Michael Jackson's death. ""We want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family,"" the two brothers said in a joint statement.  ""While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother, we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael's death,"" they said. While the head of the British company promoting the show, Global Events Live, hinted it could include a Jackson brothers reunion, the statement from Jermaine and Randy Jackson on Monday indicated that would not happen. ""In light of this, we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter, Global Live,"" Randy and Jermaine Jackson said. Their statement said the idea of the October concert was presented to the entire family in April ""as an idea already in its advanced stages.""  The decision to go ahead with it ""disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms"" by some members of the Jackson family, they said. La Toya Jackson said the ""tribute will be something that's spectacular"" and is ""far, far, well overdue.' The Jacksons' mother called it ""a show fit for a king,"" ""If my son were here today, he would feel the same way,"" Katherine Jackson said. Executors for the late pop singer's estate were unaware of the planned tribute, estate spokesman Jim Bates told CNN. ""The estate has not been contacted and is not involved with Global Live Events in the UK tribute concert announced today,"" he said. The show will ""feature the world's most amazing music performers,"" according to the head of British promoter Global Live. The roster will be revealed online one act at a time over the next two weeks, starting Tuesday, Chris Hunt said. All profits from the show would go to several U.S. and British charities, including a cancer group created by the prince of Wales, Hunt said. The October 8 show, in the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, Wales, would be at least four hours long, Hunt said.  The venue will seat up to 75,000 people, he said. ""I know my brother would be very, very proud to see all the artists that he admired and respected so much coming together for this event,"" Tito Jackson said. Hunt presented the Jackson family with a $100,000 check that will go to a trust fund for Michael Jackson's three children, which they can access when they turn 21.  The children, Katherine Jackson and unidentified charities are the sole beneficiaries of Jackson's wealthy estate.","Jackson brothers Jermaine and Randy call the tribute ill-timed .

"(EW.com) -- Robert Pattinson appeared on ""Good Morning America"" today to give his second post-KStew interview — and, once again, he got through the proceedings without directly speaking about the scandal. Pattinson appeared a bit more relaxed when chatting with George Stephanopoulos than he did Monday night on ""The Daily Show."" But the heartthrob still stammered and squirmed a bit when Stephanopoulos asked about his personal life, even though She Who Must Not Be Named was never invoked directly. Stephanopoulos began by taking a leaf out of Jon Stewart's book, offering Pattinson some comfort food — in this case, a big box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which is Pattinson's favorite — before getting down to the nitty gritty. ""Everybody just wants to know, how are you doing?"" the GMA host asked. ""And what do you want your fans to know about your personal life?"" Pattinson took a fortifying sip from his mug before giving his answer: ""You know, they seem pretty excited about... whatever,"" he said with a grin, indicating the throngs outside the GMA studio with a tip of his head. ""I'd like my fans to know that... Cinnamon Toast Crunch only has 30 calories a bowl in it, for instance,"" he continued. ""Pretty much everything that comes out of my mouth is irrelevant."" ""People read things into it,"" Stephanopoulos probed. But from there, the conversation got more broad. Pattinson reiterated that he only does interviews like this one in order to promote his films, and added that he's never gotten used to the paparazzi attention he garners: ""I think if you start getting used to it, it means you're going crazy."" The host then changed the subject to Cosmopolis, praising Pattinson's performance as a ""master of the universe."" (Stephanopoulos: Secret 50 Shades of Grey fanboy?) Pattinson — who, for the record, still doesn't have a publicist — ended the interview by addressing a remark he made to Time magazine yesterday: ""The world would be a much better place, I think, if all these bankers and billionaires were followed by paparazzi and studied as carefully."" ""The weird thing is, I can't really tell you what's interesting about actors either,"" he said. ""People don't find the personal lives of people with much, much more power than any celebrity would have — don't find their personal lives interesting. I think if you put the lives of people who controlled billions of dollars on the front news of every single paper, the world would be a better place. It's the spin culture. If you took away publicists and things and people spoke for themselves, then they'd have to be responsible for their words.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A barrage of rockets and mortars fired into southern Israel continued Sunday, the latest in a four-day escalation of violence sparked by a series of attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers Thursday. By noon Sunday, 20 incoming rockets had been reported by Israeli officials. An eighth victim died from Thursday's attacks, Israeli police said Sunday. He was identified as Yitzhak Sela, a 56-year-old bus driver. The attacks on buses, cars and security personnel killed six other Israeli civilians and one soldier and wounded more than 30 people, authorities said. Since then, nearly 100 rockets have been fired into Israel, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav (Poly) Mordechai said Sunday. At least one Israeli was killed in an attack in Beer Sheva, authorities said. Mordechai blamed Hamas for the rocket attacks, saying it ""is not a movement but rather a murderous terrorist organization supported by Iran."" Hamas has denied involvement in Thursday's attacks and accused Israel of looking for a pretext to attack Gaza. The Israeli military has targeted 15 ""terrorist infrastructure sites"" in Gaza and intercepted ""around 13 rockets,"" the IDF said in a statement. Fifteen people, including three children, have been killed in the Gaza airstrikes, said Sami Zaqout of the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights. Forty-four others were injured, Zaqout said. The office of Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, in a statement Sunday, said Israel's ""rogue behavior must end."" The Palestinian government ""calls upon the Israeli government to cease and desist in its use of its unjustified aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza and to respect international law and refrain from revenge, terror, and collective punishment tactics,"" the statement said. On Sunday, an IDF airstrike north of Gaza City hit an abandoned Hamas police training camp, Hamas sources said. No injuries were reported. Israeli authorities arrested dozens of men in Hebron and surrounding towns. Among the 60 arrested was a member of the Palestinian legislative council and others known to either belong to or support Hamas, said Hebron Gov. Kamel Hamid. The rockets and mortars fired from Gaza on Saturday forced more than 500,000 people into bomb shelters, Israeli defense officials said. Thursday's string of attacks was the deadliest against the Israeli population in two years. The attacks occurred about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Israeli city of Eilat, close to the Israeli-Egyptian border. Israeli soldiers exchanged gunfire with the assailants and killed seven militants, the military said. Early Saturday, the Hamas military wing Izzedine al Qassam Brigades, announced it was ending a de facto two-year truce with Israel. The series of attacks and airstrikes comes a month before Palestinian officials plan to make a bid for statehood in the United Nations. ""The retaliation in Gaza and what happened last night in Hebron is not acceptable,"" Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said on Sunday. ""What is happening right now is making us very sure that our strategy of getting full recognition from the United Nations is the right way to go because when we are a full member of the U.N., Israel will have to think twice before attacking us."" Israel seized Gaza, the West Bank and other territory during the 1967 Six-Day War. President Barack Obama earlier this year called on negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians to be based on border demarcations pre-dating the 1967 war. Israeli leaders have been vehemently opposed to such a move. On Saturday, the Mideast Quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- issued a statement voicing its concerns over ""the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation"" and the group of negotiators ""calls for restraint from all sides."" Israel believes the attacks have their roots in Gaza, but are coming out of the neighboring Egyptian region of Sinai. Egypt denies the allegation, saying it has been cracking down on terror groups in its portion of the Sinai. CNN's Marwah Jbara-tibi, Guy Azriel, Kevin Flower, Michal Zippori and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: An 8th victim from Thursday's attacks was identified .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans led by presidential challenger Mitt Romney served up a heaping helping of political red meat on Friday, launching a salvo of attacks on President Barack Obama that called him a liar and a failed leader. Romney told an interview broadcast on ABC that his biggest concern about the three upcoming presidential debates is that Obama will be untruthful. ""The president tends to, how shall I say it, to say things that aren't true,"" Romney said, contemplating whether he would spend debate time ""correcting things that aren't quite accurate"" or ""talking about the things I want to talk about."" In an already nasty and bitter campaign, Romney's pre-emptive strike less than three weeks before the first debate on Oct. 3 signaled more personal attacks to come as the election campaign gallops toward the November vote. Obama appears to have maintained a narrow edge in most polls, with a new CBS News/New York Times survey released Friday giving him a slight 49%-46% advantage over the former Massachusetts governor. While the president's margin was within the survey's sampling error, making the result statistically even, the new survey continued a trend reflected in other polls of Romney failing to gain ground on the president after the recent political conventions. With less than eight weeks until the election, the Romney campaign and GOP political machine have raised the urgency of their efforts. This week, Romney took on one of Obama's perceived strengths -- his foreign policy record after ending the war in Iraq and ordering the mission that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- by saying a lack of U.S. leadership has weakened the nation's influence throughout the world. In particular, Republican politicians and conservative commentators have cited the killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans amid anti-American protests in Libya this week as an example of the nation's weakened stature around the world. At a ceremony Friday to bring home the remains of the slain Americans, Obama acknowledged the unrest in Libya and other Arab Spring nations, saying ""these are difficult days."" ""The United States of America will never retreat from the world,"" Obama declared, vowing that the killers will face justice. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also sought to project American strength and determination, labeling as ""senseless"" and totally unacceptable"" the anti-American unrest she blamed on an ""awful"" anti-Islam video on the Internet. ""The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob,"" Clinton told the somber ceremony. ""Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And we will, under the president's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world."" Both Romney and his running mate -- Rep. Paul Ryan -- mentioned the four slain Americans at separate campaign events later Friday, asking for a moment of silence after reciting the names of the dead. Earlier, Ryan kept up the attacks on Obama's foreign policy at a Values Voters summit in Washington hosted by social conservative groups. Referring to the anti-American protests in the Arab world, Ryan complained that Obama has failed to assert U.S. influence and values that could have brought a different result. ""The slaughter of brave dissidents in Syria. Mobs storming American embassies and consulates. Iran four years closer to gaining a nuclear weapon. Israel, our best ally in the region, treated with indifference bordering on contempt by the Obama administration,"" Ryan said. ""Amid all these threats and dangers, what we do not see is steady, consistent American leadership."" Calling for ""moral clarity and firmness of purpose"" in U.S. foreign policy, he added that ""only by the confident exercise of American influence are evil and violence overcome."" As he spoke, three protesters shouting about HIV/AIDS funding and corporate money were escorted out as the crowd chanted ""USA."" The protesters were from the ""Take the Money Out Of Politics Campaign"" group opposed to the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling that permitted unlimited private funding of election campaigns. The Obama campaign responded to Ryan's speech with a statement that called it ""a series of over-the-top, dishonest attacks"" that showed the 42-year-old congressman was ""just not ready for prime time."" Meanwhile, an array of other speakers at the conservative summit accused Obama of weakening the country. ""It is my belief and my opinion that Barack Obama has been the most dangerous president we have ever had on American foreign policy,"" said GOP Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a tea party favorite who ran unsuccessfully for the party's presidential nomination. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told the gathering that the upcoming election ""is going to determine whether or not the very moral fabric of our country will be upheld or whether it will be torn apart."" Also Friday, a top foreign policy adviser to Romney's campaign stood by his argument that this week's attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts in Libya and Egypt could have been averted if Romney were president. Richard Williamson, a former assistant secretary of state in the Ronald Reagan administration, said Romney's policies would have led to a better standing for the United States in the Arab Spring countries of recent years. ""A Romney administration would be there, would be more active trying to work with civil society, with reformer movements, so we would be partners in this evolution, not running behind,"" Williamson said on CNN's ""Starting Point."" Regarding Egypt, Williamson cited what he called a lack of U.S. involvement after the Egyptian protests of 2011, which ultimately led to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. In Libya, Williamson argued, the United States should have been more active in ""reconciliation and reconstruction"" after a multi-country coalition took military action against Libyan forces with American help. Romney drew criticism for blasting the Obama administration on Tuesday night -- the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States -- for a statement by the U.S. Embassy in Cairo that condemned the anti-Islam video. However, Romney's statement inaccurately said the embassy statement -- which came out before protesters invaded the compound -- was in response to the demonstration. Romney has since toned down his sharpest rhetoric on the matter but kept up the main theme, telling a New York fundraiser on Friday that ""there have been, over the years, confusing messages sent by the president of the United States to the world."" In particular, Romney argued that Obama ""had nothing to say that sent a message to the world"" during the 2009 anti-government protests in Iran, adding the president should have given direct assistance to the demonstrators. At the time, several months into his presidency, Obama condemned violence against the Iranian protesters but not did lead or call for U.S. involvement in Iran's post-election unrest. Foreign policy was not the only GOP focus on Friday. Ryan maintained the Romney campaign's criticism of Obama's record on economic issues as part of an effort to frame the November vote as a referendum on the president's performance. ""After four years of economic stewardship under these self-proclaimed advocates of the poor, and what do they have to show for it? More people in poverty, and less upward mobility wherever you look,"" said the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin. ""After four years of dividing people up with the bogus rhetoric of class warfare, just about every segment of society is worse off."" In the ABC interview, Romney conceded a rare shared stance with Obama, saying the two would draw the same ""red line"" on nuclear weapons in Iran. ""My red line is Iran may not have a nuclear weapon. It is inappropriate for them to have the capacity to terrorize the world,"" Romney said. ""Iran as a nuclear nation is unacceptable to the United States of America."" Obama has used almost identical language to describe the situation in Iran, and Romney said ""yes"" when asked in the interview if the two candidates would have the same ""red line"" going forward. CNN's Peter Hamby, Ashley Killough, Rachel Streitfeld and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: ""These are difficult days,"" President Obama says of anti-American unrest .

"(CNN) -- An elderly grandfather was greeted with hugs and kisses from his family in Washington state after returning home from months of what he called false imprisonment in a Mexican prison. Edward Chrisman, left, crosses the Mexican border into the United States after being freed in March. Ed Chrisman's wheelchair was pushed toward his cheering family members Monday at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for the highly anticipated reunion, CNN television affiliate KOMO reported. The 88-year-old's ordeal began in January, when he went to Mexico with grandson Gary Chrisman Jr. for inexpensive dental work, family members said. The pair ran into trouble in Algodones, Mexico. At a convenience store, the younger Chrisman went inside to buy soft drinks while his grandfather waited in the car. The younger Chrisman had been photographing the area and approached a woman in the store about snapping shots of her daughters. He offered them $25; they agreed, and he took a few pictures of the teenagers' faces. At that point, the Chrisman family says, the mother demanded more money from Gary Chrisman, he refused, and she called authorities, alleging that he had tried taking pornographic pictures of her daughters. Both men were arrested, but the police report does not say why the elder Chrisman was arrested. A Mexican judge ruled that Ed Chrisman could be released based on his age and health, KOMO reported. The grandson remains in a Mexican jail, awaiting trial. Ed Chrisman, of Arlington, Washington, was released in early March. But he caught the flu in jail and was recovering in Arizona. He described wretched conditions in jail, family members said, including rats that were large enough to drag away a guard dog's puppies.

"(CNN) -- Last time around, humanity's savior came in the form of a human messiah. This time, if technology analysts, bankers and venture capitalists are to be believed, it will take the form of a handheld computer otherwise known as a smartphone. That's right, the new Apple iPhone announced Wednesday is already being credited with saving the United States economy. According to JP Morgan, sales of the new device should boost our nation's GDP by as much as 0.5% in the fourth quarter of this year alone. That's not a misprint, but half a percent of the nation's economic activity, or $3.2 billion. It's hard to know whether such proclamations - even if true - say as much about the power of smartphones as they do about the weakness of the rest of the economy. In either case, however, I can't help but fear yet another hyper-inflated bubble in the making. Maybe smartphones make us 'SuperStupid'? First off, most of the projected $3.2 billion won't be from consumers to Apple, but from wireless carriers subsidizing their subscriber's purchases in return for contract extensions. That's not really ""growth"" the way we used to define it in economics class. But that doesn't stop us from mistaking wireless as a pure growth industry, and far too many from placing their bets accordingly. Working as I do in New York's Silicon Alley, it's hard not to bump into an iPhone app builder or investor everywhere I go. Labs, incubators and angel investing groups are quite focused - some might argue obsessed - with launching the next monster iPhone hit, and then selling before it crashes. Top-ranked iPhone app Draw Something, for example, peaked at around 50 million downloads this spring. This was just in time for its developer to be bought by Zynga for $200 million, and then start its descent into obscurity the very next day. Even the students at the graduate digital programs where I teach have shifted from building for computer or the Web to developing for the iPhone. Like garage bands of yesterday, they toil away in the hope of getting the next big hit. Yes, we've been here before. First time, for me anyway, was the CD-ROM craze. Flashy interactivity, new authoring tools and seemingly infinite storage space led many media publishers to believe that CD-ROMs would be to the digital era what books were to that of text. They obsolesced themselves as a viable format (mostly by being slow and boring) even before networking speeds made disks irrelevant. The dotcom boom appeared just as infinite to those in the know. While Amazon has been left standing, Pets.com and Etoys crashed as quickly as they rose. The vast majority of online retailers surprised the Wall Street analysts betting on them. Social media was supposed to solve that problem for the tech industry and NASDAQ alike, but climaxed in the IPO of Facebook, a disappointment so far-reaching it has dragged dozens of social media companies along with it, and sent investors and entrepreneurs looking for greener pastures. The choreography of an Apple event . Like wireless handheld devices and the apps running on them. Everywhere I turn, every conference I attend, every magazine story I read seems to be based on one aspect of these technologies or another. Everyone is hard at work on an iPhone app that lists, maps, or socializes some data set in some new visual way. Pictures over text, text over maps, restaurants close to subways, or apps showing subways with WiFi to download more apps. Don't get me wrong: Wireless is big, and these devices are here to stay, at least until we get comfortable with apps being embedded in objects and technology being implanted in our bodies. And while the opportunity for corporations to make billions on these apps may be overstated, we may still see a new peer-to-peer marketplace emerge between independent developers and the users of their bounty of applications. But the extent to which entrepreneurs, developers, and even columns like this one depend on Apple and the rest of the wireless computing industry for new grist far exceeds their true impact or potential. So go, get an iPhone. Enjoy it. But find something or someone else to save you.

"(CNN) -- Kenyan police are searching for 12 members of the Eritrean national soccer team who failed to return home after competing in a regional tournament in Nairobi, a spokesman said Monday. The missing players make up nearly half the 25 players and coaches Eritrea sent to the Cecafa Cup, a tournament for nations from east and central Africa. Team organizer Nicolas Musonye alerted police when only 13 team members departed after the tournament finished Sunday. None of the 12 missing has a visa to remain in Kenya, national police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. ""The men were last seen on Sunday after the tournament ended,"" Kiraithe said. ""They had requested a police escort to and from the stadium for the game, but had some free time after the game and absconded from their hotel."" Kiraithe said the men were likely to be found soon. ""Being players who we have escorted during the tournament, it is not like they are unknown to us. The possibility of them [successfully] hiding themselves from us is very limited,"" he said. The Eritrean government originally denied the absence of any players. But Information Minister Ali Abdu told the BBC on Tuesday they would get a ""good welcome"" on return despite ""betraying"" their country, which human rights groups have called increasingly repressive. The Eritrean team lost in the Cecafa Cup quarter-finals, with returning champions Uganda winning the two-week event. Musonye said it was not the first time Eritrean players have tried to avoid returning home: A similar incident occurred during the 2006-7 tournament in Tanzania. ""For the next Cecafa Cup, we have decided to have a police escort for the Eritrean team for the whole duration,"" Musonye said. Police have received no requests for asylum from the men, and unless they have proper visas, they will be sent back to Eritrea when found, Kiraithe said. The Refugee Consortium of Kenya, a nonprofit organization that gives free legal aid and representation to asylum seekers and refugees, would not comment to CNN. But an official speaking on condition of anonymity told the Canadian Press that 12 players had sought their help, and their case for asylum would be presented to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Eritrea is under the rule of President Isaias Afwerki, whose government has imprisoned critics and exerted increasingly authoritarian controls over the economy, media and religion, according to U.N. reports and human rights organizations. The United States accuses Eritrea of arming Islamic insurgents who are trying to topple Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government. Eritrea denies the allegation, but Uganda, which leads an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia that has taken heavy casualties during the insurgency, has sought U.N. sanctions against the Eritreans as a result. Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and the two countries fought a two-year border war in the late 1990s. Eritrean forces also clashed with troops from neighboring Djibouti in 2008. CNN's Ben Wyatt in London contributed to this report.","Players will seek asylum, refugee group tells Canadian Press .

"London (CNN) -- In 1948, a hospital outside London witnessed the birth of the Paralympic movement, as a Jewish doctor who had fled Nazi Germany sought to change the lives of patients with spinal injuries -- and inspire new hope in them through sport. The first ""Stoke Mandeville Games"" were organized in 1948 to coincide with the London Olympics, the second to be held in Britain. Named for the hospital in Buckinghamshire where Prof. Ludwig Guttmann's pioneering spinal injuries unit was based, the competitors in those initial Games -- 14 men and two women -- took part in a wheelchair archery contest. Many were military veterans injured on the battlefields of World War II. Just a year later, six teams competed at Stoke Mandeville -- with wheelchair netball, a forerunner of wheelchair basketball, being introduced -- as sport became a central part of a rehabilitation process that had been revolutionized by Guttmann. In 1956, a ""statement of intent"" was unveiled for the Games, which were by this time international, according to to the Mandeville Legacy website run by the local authority. It read: ""The aim of the Stoke Mandeville Games is to unite paralyzed men and women from all parts of the world in an international sports movement, and your spirit of true sportsmanship today will give hope and inspiration to thousands of paralyzed people."" Four years later, inspired by Guttmann's vision, the first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in tandem with the Olympics. And five decades on, some 4,280 Paralympians from 165 countries -- the largest number ever -- have returned to Britain to compete in what is now the premier international sporting event for those born with disabilities, or disabled by injury or illness. In an echo of those first Stoke Mandeville Games, a number of those competing are military veterans, this time wounded in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Blinded in Afghanistan . The United States' 227-member 2012 Paralympic team includes 20 military veterans and active-duty service members, almost 10% of the total. Among them is Navy Lt. Bradley Snyder, blinded last September in Afghanistan when a homemade bomb exploded in his face. He will compete in a swimming event on the anniversary of his injury, the Team USA website says. Described by the United States Association of Blind Athletes as ""an inspiration to others and a true American hero,"" Snyder -- who made the swim team while at the U.S. Naval Academy -- returned to the sport within weeks of losing his sight. In order to make the London 2012 team, he's had to train hard and also learn how to steer a straight course in the lanes of a 50-meter pool without the aid of vision. There's no doubting his determination. ""I am not going to let blindness build a brick wall around me,"" USABA quotes Snyder as saying. ""I'd give my eyes 100 times again to have the chance to do what I have done and what I can still do."" Veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan also figure in the 300-strong British squad, ParalympicsGB. Cyclist Jon-Allan Butterworth, who lost an arm to shrapnel from a rocket in Basra, southern Iraq, five years ago is one of them. He found his way into elite sport thanks in part to Battle Back, an initiative to boost the recovery of injured military personnel run by the UK Ministry of Defence, with help from UK charities, including Help for Heroes. Butterworth, one of eight former or current British military service personnel selected for the Games, was not an athlete before his injury -- but all that changed when he got on a bike at a talent-spotting day for injured veterans. 'Best thing that's ever happened' Within months, Butterworth shed excess pounds, embraced the technical aspects of track racing and started to break national and world records. Three years and two world championship titles later, he is keen to add a Paralympic gold medal to his haul, he told CNN. ""The way I think of it now is, it's probably the best thing that's ever happened to me,"" he said of his injury. ""I've met new people. I've tried a few things out, different sports; done loads of things that I never did before. It's kind of made me the person I am today. And I have changed since losing my arm, but I think only for the better."" Martin Colclough, who runs the Battle Back ""Phoenix"" program for Help for Heroes and was previously a major in the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, told CNN that Butterworth's remarkable achievements had been helped by close cooperation between Britain and the United States. Shortly after the Battle Back program was set up in 2008, a handful of British veterans traveled to San Diego to join dozens of American Paralympians at a sports training camp. There, Butterworth -- who was going through a tricky period in his transition to cycling -- was inspired by U.S. track cyclist Greta Neimanas. Quite literally, she ""lent a hand"" by letting Butterworth try out her prosthetic arm, specially engineered for cycling, in place of his all-purpose limb, Colclough said. The gesture gave Butterworth a vital confidence boost. This year, 17 British veterans were the first overseas athletes invited to compete in the ""Warrior Games,"" an event for disabled former and current service members staged by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) in Colorado, Colclough said. It's not necessarily easy for injured veterans to break into elite sport, especially competing against people who may have had decades to adapt to their impairments, rather than perhaps four or five years, Colclough said. But Colclough has high hopes both now and for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, by which time the Battle Back program will have been running for twice as long. The self-discipline and mental strength of those from a military background, coupled with the access they have to military training resources, helps them make the most of natural talent and fight to the top, he said. In addition, some UK Paralympic training programs are run alongside the equivalent Olympic programs, so all those involved can access the same sports science experts and groundbreaking technological advances. ""This is not a part-time endeavor,"" Colclough said. ""If you want to be world class as a Paralympian, it's a full-time occupation."" Watching around the world . As the competitors from all backgrounds make their final preparations ahead of their big day on the world stage, excitement is building among those set to witness their endeavors. The London organizing committee says more people than ever before are due to attend these Paralympic Games, with a record 2.3 million tickets already sold and more set to be released. In addition, some 4 billion TV viewers around the world are expected to tune in live to the 11-day event, which opens Wednesday, the USOC said. The International Paralympic Committee has said it will also stream more than 780 hours of sport live on its website, www.paralympic.org. In the United States, NBC plans to screen five-and-a-half hours of the Games, in four one-hour shows and a 90-minute special. The USOC says this is more than was broadcast for previous Paralympics, but some disappointed would-be viewers have set up online petitions calling for greater coverage. Over the course of the Games, American athletes will take part in 19 of the 21 sports contested and attempt to improve on their third place in the medal tables in Beijing. Some of the events will be well-known to those who were glued to the Olympics -- athletics, archery, table tennis and cycling among them -- while others, such as goalball, played by the visually impaired, wheelchair rugby and boccia, a game similar to petanque, will be less familiar to many sports fans. Viewers will have to familiarize themselves with a key element in how the Paralympics work -- the system of classification of impairments, designed to ensure that athletes in each sport compete against similarly-abled rivals. The UK government says it hopes the Games will not only inspire more disabled people to embrace sport at all levels, but also help change public perceptions about disability. 'Pride and honor' One of those at the forefront of breaking down barriers is South African runner Oscar Pistorius, the first double-amputee to compete in both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Born with missing fibulas -- his legs were amputated below the knees as an infant -- Pistorius uses special carbon fiber prosthetic limbs. Nicknamed ""The Blade Runner,"" Pistorius made it to the semifinals of the individual 400-meter and the 400-meter relay final at London 2012, competing against able-bodied athletes. He will be back in front of the roaring crowds at the Olympic Stadium to defend his Paralympic 100-meter, 200-meter and 400-meter titles. His status as a world-class athlete, as well as a disability pioneer, has seen Pistorius grace the cover of publications from the New York Times Magazine to GQ and Men's Health in South Africa. He also made it into Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in 2012. The United States has its own ""Blade Runners"" in sprinter Blake Leeper, a double amputee who could challenge Pistorius over 100 meters, and 22-year-old Jarryd Wallace, from Georgia. The latter had his right leg amputated two years ago because of a medical condition but has swiftly transitioned from a talented able-bodied runner to a Paralympic contender. Other U.S. Paralympians to watch in 2012 include swimmer Jessica Long, who took six medals at the Beijing Paralympics, four of them gold, and wheelchair racer Jessica Galli, who won five medals in 2008 and set a world record over 200 meters. ""Our Paralympians embody what it means to be an American,"" USOC chief executive Scott Blackmun says on the body's website. ""They will compete with the pride and honor that is inherent in representing the United States of America, inspiring Americans young and old with their stories of triumph."" Athletes from other nations will similarly dazzle and inspire those around them, as they overcome all odds to take home medals. From its humble beginnings in Stoke Mandeville, the place which also lends its name to one of the one-eyed London 2012 mascots, the Paralympic movement has come a long way. But in its commitment to bringing people together to test and celebrate what they can do, rather than what they cannot, its core spirit has remained unchanged. CNN's Matthew Chance and Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","Paralympic movement was born in Stoke Mandeville, outside London, in 1948 .

"(CNN) -- The soaring popularity of smartphones and tablets is eroding the distinction between our business and personal worlds, says the head of British telecoms giant BT. Ian Livingston, BT's chief executive officer, told Marketplace Europe the ""consumerization"" of business -- the trend for personal consumer devices such as smartphones and tablet computers to be used in the workplace -- was redefining the way we do business. ""One of the things that we are seeing is the barrier between business and consumer is beginning to come down,"" he said. ""What was assumed in the past was very much [that] your business life is over here and your personal life is over there -- that is not true, certainly not true for most of your business people."" The consumer sector was now taking the lead when it came to innovations in communication technology, giving workers the opportunity stay connected on their personal device around the clock -- whether in the office, at home or traveling. ""People are going to become networked all the time,"" he said. ""I think we are just at the beginning of this revolution."" While there were clear benefits for businesses to be had from the new reality, it also raised challenges around security. ""It used to be that the IT department would say: 'How can I stop people from using it on our corporate network?'"" he said. ""Today it is 'How can I help people use it securely on the corporate network?'"" Livingston said BT was meeting some of the infrastructure costs required for the new communications environment by focusing on improving its customer service. ""The reason we start with customer service, apart from the obvious fact that customers like better service, is actually the biggest cost of our business and any telecoms business is the cost of failure."" Through initiatives such as the company's ""First Time Right"" program, it had managed to reduce its cost base by Â£3 billion ($4.7 billion) over three years -- and halved the number of complaints received. ""Take the failures out of the business -- and we have done a lot of that -- and the costs fall out automatically,"" he said. ""That cost transformation has got more to go, and it also frees up money and people to invest in the future of business.""","BT CEO: The growth of smartphones and tablets is changing our work patterns .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters were battling a gas line or gas-fueled blaze Thursday evening that engulfed dozens of homes and sent bright flames and huge plumes of smoke shooting hundreds of feet into the air in a neighborhood in San Bruno, California, emergency management officials said. ""The flames are being fueled by something,"" said Kelly Huston of California Emergency Management.  ""There was a loud explosion being reported by witness and just dozens of homes on fire"" He said there were some injured and walking wounded after the fire, which started around 7 p.m. (10 p.m. ET). ""Crews are just trying to assess how many injuries they have there and what they're going to do to contain the flames,"" Huston said. Investigators were still trying to determine what caused the fire. ""It was a gas station explosion, or a pipeline close to a gas station,"" said Jay Alan, a spokesman for California Emergency Management, citing informationg from the San Bruno Police Department. Authorities are worried about winds that could spread the fire and embers that are falling on adjacent houses, he said. Helicopters were dropping retardant on homes to try to stop the fire's spread. They are still assessing the area and trying to determine how many people are injured, he said. ""It's still very much an unfolding incident as we speak,"" he said. CNN affiliate KGO reported that people as far as a half-mile away said they felt the boom and heat of the explosion. An evacuation center has been set up and the Red Cross is heading to the scene to provide aid to residents, KGO said. Church of Highlands Staff Pastor Leigh Bishop told CNN he witnessed a ""devastating explosion"" that caused the fast-moving fire. Bishop said two people from his church had lost their homes and at least one person had burn injuries. Kaiser Permanente South San Francisco hospital received three people in ambulances and four walk-ins with injuries from the fire, Administrative Services Director Nida Winnett said. Six of those people were in the hospital's intensive care unit, and three of them are suffering from burns, Winnett said. Seton Medical Center spokeswoman Beth Nikels said three people with injuries from the fire came to the hospital, and one is being transported to a burn center. California's state fire department is sending 25 fire engines to the area to help battle the blaze at the request of the local fire department, spokesman Daniel Berlant said. The fire is in a populated area about two miles west of San Francisco International Airport, Huston said. All flights and operations there were normal Thursday evening, airport spokesman Michael Brown said. At least 5,000 customers are without electricity, KGO reported. ""I will be closely monitoring the situation with the California Emergency Management Agency and will ensure a swift investigation begins to determine the causes,"" California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado said in a statement.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A low water level in a reactor building at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan may have exposed fuel rods and caused them to melt, the owner of the facility said Thursday. Tokyo Electric Power Co. blamed the incident on a faulty gauge that monitors the water level in the pressure vessel in the No. 1 reactor building. ""I would say at this point that the situation is not dangerous,"" said Mujid Kazimi, a professor of nuclear engineering and mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Nuclear Energy Institute had a similar response to the new details released by Tokyo Electric. ""This is in no way alarming,"" said Tom Kauffman, senior media relations manager at the Washington-based institute. ""It was anticipated that there was fuel damage in reactors 1, 2 and 3. This is confirmation,"" he said. ""It's a situation that's going to develop over time,"" with details continuing to emerge as nuclear plant workers gain more access to the reactors, Kauffman added. ""This is going to evolve over months, maybe many months."" Once the faulty gauge was reset, workers discovered Thursday that the water level had dropped more than 3 feet (1 meter) below the fuel rods, which need to be cooled by water to keep them from melting. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said there's a high possibility that the fuel rods have melted and are now being cooled by water in the bottom of the pressure vessel. The company said it suspects there is a leak in the pressure vessel, since the water level was low despite the company pouring 150 tons of water a day on the No. 1 reactor to cool it. A March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi, causing the three operating reactors to overheat. That compounded a natural disaster by spewing vast quantities of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Workers have been able to install air filters inside the No. 1 reactor building to contain radioactive particles and have begun filling the primary containment shell around the reactor core with water in an attempt to draw heat off the core. The plan is to recirculate that water through a heat exchanger to cool it, said Yoshikazu Nagai, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric. Similar plans are being considered for unit 2, which also is thought to be leaking radioactive water, and unit 3, where engineers noted a disturbing rise in the reactor's temperature readings last week, Nagai told CNN. ""First we have to tackle unit No. 1, and we need to see if we can succeed,"" he said. Meanwhile, equipment that will be used to decontaminate water pooling in the plant's basements is expected to arrive by mid-May. Tens of thousands of tons of radioactive water have flooded the basements where the cooling systems were housed, making it impossible for workers get into the facilities. At this point, ""The danger is more with the workers who deal with (the leak) than the public,"" Kazimi said. Decontaminating the water pooling in the plant's basements is feasible, as long as the water stays contained, he added. To limit further possible spread of contamination beyond the evacuation zone around the nuclear plant, Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forest and Fisheries on Thursday decided to euthanize livestock in the zone. There is a no-entry zone within a 20-kilometer radius of Fukushima Daiichi. ""It is yet to be determined how and when they do (the euthanizing), but we would cull livestock with the most painless way with permission of the owners of them,"" a spokesman for the Fukushima prefectural government said. It's unclear how many livestock survive in the zone, but before the disaster there were approximately 3,500 cows, 30,000 pigs, 440,000 chickens, 100 horses and an unknown number of sheep. With their owners having evacuated, the livestock have been left to fend for themselves. CNN's Kyung Lah, Noriaki Kawai and Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo contributed to this report.","NEW: Government decides to euthanize livestock in no-entry zone .

"Bastrop, Texas (CNN) -- A raging wildfire near Austin, Texas, killed two people, officials said Tuesday, as firefighters fought to gain the upper hand against flames, wind and fatigue. The deaths raise the overall toll from the outbreak of fires to four lives lost. A wildfire killed a woman and her 18-month-old child Sunday when flames engulfed their home near Gladewater, officials said. ""Texas is in a difficult situation right now, and our priorities are pretty simple. No. 1 is to protect life at all costs,"" said Nim Kidd, chief of the state Division of Emergency Management. The Texas Forest Service said it has responded to 181 fires that have burned more than 118,400 acres over the last week. The fires have destroyed more than 700 homes since Sunday, according to the forest service. More than 1,000 homes have burned in the state since fire season began in November, Gov. Rick Perry's office said. Winds that had peaked at nearly 30 mph had calmed to little more than half that Tuesday, giving firefighters a bit of a break. ""It's been a little calmer today,"" Mary Kay Hicks, a forest service official, told CNN's ""AC 360."" ""The wind has really died down and helped us get more of a handle of what's going on out there,"" she said. The largest fire, near Austin, has spread across 30,000 acres, destroying more than 600 homes and forcing the evacuations of at least 5,000 people, officials said Tuesday. Known as the Bastrop County Complex, the fire has burned largely uncontrolled since it began Sunday afternoon. The two people killed by the blaze near Austin were not public safety personnel, according to incident command officials. The officials declined to offer details. ""I don't think it's registered in our brains that our house is gone and that, really, half of Bastrop is gone,"" said evacuee Claire Johnson. The danger from a fire near Houston -- called the Magnolia fire -- appeared to be lessening for the most populated areas. Officials in Harris County, which includes Houston, said the fire was no longer a threat there. Also, many residents were being allowed back into their homes Tuesday in neighboring Montgomery County. About 4,000 homes in Montgomery had been evacuated, according to Lt. Dan Norris of the county's emergency management office. Firefighters continued to battle hot spots in Montgomery, but the bulk of the problems from the Magnolia fire appeared to be centered in Waller and Grimes counties, Norris said. Another blaze in Grimes County, the Riley Road fire, has destroyed 20 homes and has hundreds more in its path, the forest service said. It had burned 3,000 acres as of Tuesday, according to the forest service. Two major fires in Travis County destroyed 44 structures and damaged 74 others, Roger Wade, a spokesman for the Travis County Sheriff's Office, said Tuesday. Authorities allowed residents of the Steiner Ranch area, burned by one of those Travis fires, to return to their homes Tuesday afternoon. Nichelle Bielinski was one such resident. Standing amid the ruin of her two-story house, where smoke was still rising, she took stock. ""I'm OK,"" she said. ""I am the luckiest person in the world. My family is safe."" Four firefighters working the Magnolia fire were taken to a hospital for treatment of heat exhaustion, according to the Montgomery County Office of Emergency Management. One also had an ankle injury. All injuries were minor, the agency said. The Bastrop County fire started Sunday and spread quickly Monday on winds fueled by what was once Tropical Storm Lee. As the fire spread, firefighters would leave one structure thinking it was safe to work on another, only to return and find the first building had burned, said Tim Simpson, a firefighter deployed to Texas from Johnsondale, California. ""We were doing everything we could,"" he said. Firefighters accustomed to attacking a fire head-on could do little more than pick around the edges, trying to protect whatever they could, said Tom Boggus, director of the Texas Forest Service. ""We've been very defensive. It's all we could do until now,"" he said. The historic drought in Texas has created ideal conditions for the rapid spread of wildfire. So far in 2011, 7.2 million acres of grass, scrub and forest have burned in wildfires nationwide. Of those, some 3.5 million acres -- nearly half -- have been in Texas, according to Inciweb, a fire-tracking website maintained by state and federal agencies. Tuesday marked the 294th consecutive day of wildfires in Texas, according to Inciweb. More than 2,000 firefighters are working fires across the state, Boggus said. Fatigue is a major issue, he added, especially for volunteer firefighters from local departments who form the backbone of the response. Boggus said Texas officials are seeking additional resources from around the country to help battle the fires. CNN's Jim Spellman, Chris Welch, Melanie Whitley and Rich Phillips, and journalist Jocelyn Lane, contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's been a little calmer today,"" a fire official says .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona state senator involved in an apparent freeway-shoulder scuffle with his girlfriend was not detained because he has immunity from arrest while the legislature is in session, police said. Officers in Phoenix who were called to investigate a reported altercation found that both Sen. Scott Bundgaard and his girlfriend, Aubry Ballard, had marks suggesting a physical dispute, police spokesman Sgt. Tommy Thompson said. Bundgaard, a Republican and the state senate's majority leader, was allowed to go -- although prosecutors will review the case and could later file charges, Thompson said. Ballard was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor assault and taken to jail. In a joint statement Sunday, Bundgaard and Ballard said they were ""tired and embarrassed"" because of the incident. ""We want to jointly apologize for allowing a private matter to interrupt the public -- and especially for taking up the valuable time of law enforcement. The police officers who responded deserve thanks for their sensitivity and compassion,"" they said. Bundgaard said the dispute began on the way home from a charity ""Dancing with the Stars"" fundraiser, after Ballard accused him of ""inappropriately touching"" his dance partner. ""She proceeded to throw my clothes and other things out of my car on a freeway as I took her home,"" Bundgaard said in a statement Saturday. The senator said he tried to stop his girlfriend from punching him, which resulted in marks on her knees. Bundgaard said he pulled Ballard out of the car, but denied ever hitting or pushing her. ""I have never inappropriately touched a woman and never would. There was no domestic violence,"" Bundgaard said. Ballard described the incident as ""the absolute worst night of my life"" in her own statement released Saturday. ""To go from putting on a beautiful dress for a great date to a fundraiser to ending up on the side of a freeway? I don't have another tear left to cry,"" she said. ""I'm still trying to get my mind around a few things: Scott's actions, the 17 hours I spent in jail awaiting processing, my bruises, scrapes and soreness and his statements to the media.""

"(CNN) -- Top British officials paid a visit Saturday to leaders of Libya's opposition government, the beneficiary of the first NATO helicopter attacks on ruler Moammar Gadhafi' military vehicles, equipment and forces. Foreign Secretary William Hague and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell traveled to Benghazi, where they reiterated support for the Transitional National Council. According to a statement, Mitchell announced new support for the clearing of mines in besieged cities, including Misrata. He and Hague visited a Benghazi hospital treating those wounded in the conflict. The visit, which included a discussion of the country's possible future, followed helicopter attacks by British and French forces on the regime's military. ""This successful engagement demonstrates the unique capabilities brought to bear by attack helicopters,"" said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, who commands NATO's Libya operation. ""We will continue to use these assets whenever and wherever needed, using the same precision as we do in all of our missions."" British forces, flying from the HMS Ocean, used Apache helicopters for the overnight strikes, according to the Ministry of Defence. French helicopters took off from the assault ship Tonnerre, the ministry said in a statement. The Apaches struck a regime radar installation and a military checkpoint, both located around Brega, a key oil town in the east, British officials said. Hellfire missiles and 30mm cannon were used to destroy the targets, they said. Royal Air Force ground attack aircraft destroyed another military installation, while a separate mission hammered two ammunition bunkers in central Libya, according to the statement. A French military spokesman said 20 targets, including vehicles, were destroyed. Several helicopters responded to small-arms fire from the ground, but none were hit, he said. ""The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Gadhafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas,"" NATO said in a statement. Meanwhile, a string of explosions -- at least 10 -- rocked the Libyan capital of Tripoli early Saturday evening, CNN journalists reported. Six more explosions were heard early Sunday. One of the explosions struck an old military station about 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of the city, a government official said. There also was fighting in the western city of Zintan. According to Mamdouh Dardair, a rebel fighter, portions of the town were hit by a large number of rockets fired by Gadhafi forces. The rockets damaged infrastructure, but there were no immediate reports of injuries. CNN could not confirm the account. On Friday, fighting continued in the western town of Yefren, where NATO-allied aircraft destroyed government tanks and personnel carriers, officials said. NATO warplanes belonging to the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force fired Paveway guided bombs and destroyed two main battle tanks and two armored personnel carriers belonging to Libya's military, said Maj. Gen. John Lorimer, strategic communication officer for the chief of the defense staff. The airstrikes occurred Thursday, he said. NATO reported that government forces were continuing ""to attack the peoples of the western highlands,"" Lorimer said. Meanwhile, rebels claimed to liberate Yefren and the nearby town of Kikla, both of which are about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of their stronghold in Zintan, one rebel fighter said. Talhat al-Jiwayli, a rebel on the front lines in Zintan, also said that anti-Gadhafi forces were surrounding the town of al-Rayyana, more than seven miles northeast of Zintan. A resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council in March authorized member states ""to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country, including Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory."" .

"London (CNN) -- Armed with a silky-smooth voice and an uncompromising spirit, Nigerian singer/songwriter Ola Onabulé has won admirers around the world. With a career spanning nearly two decades, the Nigerian singer has often been described as one of music's best-kept secrets. Onabulé says that although he can hear ""the hidden compliment"" in that phrase, he works hard to do even better. ""It's not right that I should be a secret, I mean this isn't a profession in which to be kept a secret,"" he says. ""You stand on a stage and put it out there because you want as many people as possible to hear your song or your idea or your message."" His musical style blends his African roots with elements of jazz and soul, while his passionate singing moves between the heights and depths of emotion. In tune with his wide-ranging vocal skills, Onabulé's songs encompass a wide range of topics, from personal experiences to social-minded commentary. ""I write songs about why in my dear continent we spend as much time as we do harking back to the things that were done to us in the past when, although they are incredibly valid these sentiments, there is also the argument for as much time to be put into finding our way out of this difficult situation,"" says Onabulé. Born in London to Nigerian parents, the velvet-voiced singer moved to Nigeria at an early age. The vivid memories of pounding African drums and spicy Nigerian food followed him back to the United Kingdom where he returned just before he turned 17. That transition wasn't without its challenges, says Onabulé, as he spent the first couple of years trying to figure out his place in the world while bridging his different cultures. ""I spent a very long time working out where I fitted in the whole scheme of things,"" he says. ""Subconsciously I think I very much wanted to be a Nigerian, wanted very much to be an African and I had to work out a way of negotiating how I could do that whilst knowing that for survival purposes also I had to assimilate as much as possible into where I found myself in amongst here."" Initially set for a career in law, Onabulé abandoned his studies to follow his passion for music and pursue a rather more uncertain career as a singer. His talents didn't go unnoticed and in the early 1990s he was signed by record label Elektra. However, his encounter with the system of big record companies didn't last long. ""I learned through bitter experience what I definitely, absolutely wanted and what I didn't,"" he says. ""(There was) a lot of kind pre-described, focus group-type artist development where you'd bring a song in and people take their metaphorical scalpels out and shave bits -- 'the kids won't love that, the kids won't love that' -- take bits off."" When the deal fell apart little more than a year later, Onabulé says he knew ""without a shadow of a doubt that I wanted as much autonomy as possible and that would mean walking my own path independently."" Onabulé's perseverance saw him eventually building his own studio and setting up his own label. He has seven albums under his belt so far, and his latest offering, ""Seven Shades Darker,"" was released earlier in 2011. As in his previous works, Onabulé's African roots are evident in his latest album and influence the message he is trying to convey. He says: ""I'm very keen for Africa to change its course, to find its way and really find a way of standing shoulder to shoulder with the league of nations. ""If I switch on the news and I see another sad story about Africa, I wonder, I want to write a song that says how come we haven't managed to get across the fact that repeatedly on the United Nations' happiest countries lists the top 10 counties are almost always African? I mean how come we don't get that story across? How come it's always the representations of poverty and corruption, brutality?""","Ola Onabulé is an acclaimed Nigerian singer and songwriter .

"Sabha, Libya (CNN) -- Sabha -- a dusty city southwest of Tripoli -- has long been considered a staunch pro-Moammar Gadhafi stronghold, but many of its residents greeted fighters from the new government warmly as they rolled into the city Tuesday. A CNN crew accompanying National Transitional Council fighters witnessed people cheering for the new ruling forces. Fighting was reported in one neighborhood, al-Manshiya. Dr. Mohamad Altaib of Sabha central hospital reported some rebel fighters died from Gadhafi loyalist sniper fire there. There have been press reports that Gadhafi, his family members or his political allies have been hiding out in the city -- the largest city in the Sahara and long a way station for smuggling operations to and from points south and west, such as Algeria, Niger and Chad. The fall of Sabha is significant because it means other parts of Libya, still holding out, are now cut off. NTC fighters fanned out across the city in search of Gadhafi associates. Weaponry was found in one house, but so far, there has been no sign of Gadhafi or Abdullah Al-Senussi, the former head of military intelligence. The men, thought to have been hiding in the city, are wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Many top officials of the old regime are thought to have passed through the city on their way to Niger but it would be tougher for them to do so now because the city is surrounded by NTC fighters. People on the street said they are pleased Libya is free and have supported the uprising from the start. However, they haven't displayed their stances because of government suppression. At the same time, it's hard to gauge the extent of support or opposition for the NTC. The NTC forces took the airport and the citadel, said Col. Ahmed Bani, the NTC's military spokesman, Monday. ""Our flag is waving high in both locations,"" he said. East of Sabha on Monday, a ragtag stream of civilians-turned-revolutionaries encountered scant resistance as they swept through oasis towns. Sabha is among a handful of enclaves where Gadhafi has had support. About 400,000 people live in Sabha's province and about half of them live in the city. Other enclaves include Bani Walid and Sirte in the north. At least 46 fighters loyal to Libya's new leaders have been killed and 221 wounded since they launched their offensive on Sirte, Ali Gheliwan, a spokesman for the Misrata Military Council, told CNN. The death toll includes four people killed Tuesday in fighting south of the city, in Abuhadi, he said. CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","4 people are killed Tuesday in Abuhadi, a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Iranian forces have launched a fresh offensive against Kurdish rebels, with a senior military commander telling a state-run news agency Saturday that 30 rebels were killed or injured in the operation. Col. Hamid Ahmad, with the Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards corps, told the official Islamic Republic News Agency that the effort began Friday afternoon in the northwest part of the Middle Eastern nation in an area bordering Iraq. He described the mission as ongoing. ""The major operation against (Party of Free Life of Kurdistan, or PJAK) agents in the northwest borders will continue until the purification of the region from terrorists,"" Ahmad said. It was not clear in the state-run news agency report whether the rebels crossed from Iraq into Iran. Iranian forces have repeatedly shelled the border area between Iran and Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, targeting Kurdish rebels who say they want their own independent country. Blaming PJAK for violating a ceasefire, Ahmad said that two Kurds who were protecting the group's members had been killed in the latest offensive. Revolutionary Guard troops also ""killed, injured and arrested tens of terrorists"" and destroyed a rebel camp near the city of Sardasht, the news agency reported. Sardasht is a predominately Kurdish town that sits on the Iran-Iraq border. The military operation includes about 5,000 Iranian troops in the northwest part of the country, and comes two months after Iranian forces reportedly captured ""several teams of PJAK (members) who intended to infiltrate Iran to stage terrorist operations,"" claims IRNA. Like Turkey and Iraq, Iranian forces have had repeated battles with ethnic Kurdish fighters. The PJAK group is part of an alliance of Kurdish rebel groups that includes the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which conducts attacks against Turkey from northern Iraq. This group is considered a terror group by the United States, though the IRNA report claims that Iranian officials repeatedly have complained such Kurdish rebels are being supported by Washington.","A Revolutionary Guard commander tells IRNA an operation was launched Friday .

"(EW.com) -- The July 20 shooting spree at a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Aurora, Colorado, seems ultimately to have had a relatively modest impact on the release of the superhero blockbuster, at least in terms of its box-office performance. But it has thrown a major wrench into Warner Bros.' plans for another film, the upcoming action-drama ""Gangster Squad."" In the immediate wake of the shooting, the studio pulled the trailers for the film, which — in a grisly unintended echo of the Aurora tragedy — featured a scene of mobsters bursting through a movie screen and firing machine guns at people seated in a movie theater. Days later, the studio and director Ruben Fleischer (""Zombieland"") decided to cut, or at least extensively rework, that scene. Given that the movie-theater-gangland-massacre sequence was a key plot point in the film — which stars Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling as Los Angeles cops assigned to take down real-life 1940s mob kingpin Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) — any changes to it inevitably would necessitate script revisions and reshoots, jeopardizing the film's planned Sept. 7 release date. Now a source confirms that Warner Bros. is pulling the film off of the fall schedule. No new date has been determined yet, though according to the Hollywood Reporter, the studio is eyeing dates in January as a possibility. Warner Bros. declined to comment on the decision, but clearly moving the film will both allow the filmmakers the time required to make changes to the movie and give the studio an opportunity to reboot a marketing campaign that was derailed by horrible circumstances no one could have foreseen.

"(CNN) -- Singer Pink has confirmed what some have been speculating online for a while: she is eating for two these days. The ""Stupid Girls"" singer made the announcement during a taping of the ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" set to air Wednesday. Pink -- whose real name is Alecia Beth Moore -- said she did not want to announce she was pregnant earlier because she's had a miscarriage. ""I didn't want to talk about it because I was just really nervous ... but if I was going to talk about it with anyone, it was going to be with you,"" she told the talk show host. When DeGeneres asked her the baby's sex, she said the doctor thinks it's a girl. ""I'm terrified because she thinks it's a girl,"" she said. ""My mom has always wished me a daughter just like me. I'm terrified one of us will go to jail."" The 31-year-old said she and husband, Carey Hart, have always wanted a baby. ""I worked for it,"" Pink said. ""It was not an Oops."" The two have had a tumultuous past. They briefly broke up in 2008. After the breakup, Pink released the song ""Please Don't Leave Me"" that chronicles a love-hate relationship with a boyfriend she can't let go of. In the song released last year, she sings, ""I always say how I don't need you, but it's always gonna come right back to this, please don't leave me."" The two got back together after the song's release. Pink told DeGeneres the time apart brought them closer. ""I never had anything in my life that I didn't work hard for and my relationship is that,"" she said. ""We worked really hard and we had our little meltdowns, a couple of them, and now, we're honestly, we both needed to do that and come back together. It's just yummy.""

"The script for Chelsea's European Champions League triumph last season was out of the realms of Hollywood , but Juventus refused to roll out the red carpet for the holders as the Serie A title winners came from behind to secure a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea almost had an Oscar winning performance from one of their Brazilian stars, with the former Internacional midfielder scoring twice on his debut to confirm his reputation as one of the game's most exciting talents. Oscar's two first-half strikes looked to have given Chelsea the perfect start to their title defense until a twist in the script saw Juventus fight back to claim a deserved draw. It was the perfect ending to a thrilling game between two of Europe's heavyweight contenders with Oscar the star of the show. While his first goal arrived courtesy of a deflection, his second could only be described as a blockbuster. The 21-year-old received the ball with his back to goal before pirouetting and curling an unstoppable effort into the top corner. But there was still drama to come for Chelsea, who failed to show the kind of defense which allowed them to triumph in Munich last season. Arturo Vidal pulled a goal back for the Italians seven minutes before the break as Juventus began to find a way back into the contest. Fabio Quagliarella then grabbed an equalizer with 10 minutes remaining and nearly won the tie when his curling effort rebounded to safety off the crossbar. The Stamford Bridge draw allowed Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk to lead Group E following their convincing 2-0 win over Danish side Nordsjælland. Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored both goals for Shakhtar, who face Juventus in Turin in their next game. In Group F, Valencia failed to gain revenge over Bayern Munich for their 2001 Champions League final defeat. The Germans, who finished runners-up to Chelsea last season, triumphed 2-1 at the Allianz Arena. Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos put the home side into the ascendancy with Nelson Valdez pulling a late goal back for Valencia. Bayern are second in Group F after Belorussian champions BATE Borisov produced a surprise 3-1 win at French side Lille. BATE had failed to win any of their previous 12 games in the Champions League group stages but eased to victory on this occasion. Aleksandr Volodko gave the visitors a sixth minute lead before Vitali Rodionov and Edgar Olekhnovich added further goals to make it 3-0 at the interval. Aurélien Chedjou pulled a goal back for Lille, but it was not enough to deprive BATE of their first Champions League success. Not for the first time Lionel Messi rescued Barcelona from a potential shock defeat against Spartak Moscow in Group G. The Argentine international scored his 52nd and 53rd Champions League goals in the space of nine minutes as Barcelona came from 2-1 down to win 3-2. Winger Cristian Tello had given the home side a 14th minute lead before Spartak silenced the Catalan faithful. Emmanuel Emenike's cross was turned into his own net by Dani Alves and then Romulo rounded off a quick counterattack to put Spartak ahead. Barcelona has not suffered a home defeat in the Champions League Group Stage since losing to Russian side Rubin Kazan back in 2009. Celtic and Benfica shared a goalless draw with neither side managing to find a way past two stubborn defences. It is the first time Benfica has managed to secure a point in Scotland having lost on their previous three visits. Manchester United gained a fortunate 1-0 victory over Galatasaray in Group H thanks to Michael Carrick's early goal as manager Sir Alex Ferguson recorded his 100th win in the competition. The visitors will feel frustrated though as they created several clear opportunities and hit the woodwork twice. United should have sealed the win in the second half but Nani failed to convert from the penalty spot. In the group's other game, Romanian champions CFR Cluj claimed a shock 2-0 win over Braga in Portugal, with Rafael Bastos returning to haunt his former club by scoring both goals.","Defending champions Chelsea held at home .

"(CNN) -- Three people died Tuesday in an explosion in the Turkish capital Ankara, in what may have been a terror attack, Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin told CNN sister network CNN Turk. ""There was a powerful explosion in a car that was parked,"" the minister said, citing preliminary information. ""The possibility that it was a terrorist attack is high."" He said it was also possible that a gas explosion had caused the blast, ""though that is a weak possibility."" The explosion shook a crowded street in the center of Ankara, damaging vehicles and buildings on Kumrular Street near the Kizilay metro station, the official Anatolia news agency reported. An eyewitness described the scene as ""terrible"" and ""very chaotic."" ""Cars were exploding. Pieces were spreading around. We were terrified,"" the unnamed witness told CNN Turk. Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said earlier there were no deaths, but 15 people were wounded, Anatolia reported. Ankara governor Alaaddin Yuksel said officials, including police and a prosecutor, were investigating the cause of the blast. He said many cars were parked on the street with garbage bags under them at the time of the explosion. Five people are in surgery, he added. An emergency services doctor at Numune Hospital in Ankara said 10 injured people were brought to the hospital. One was in intensive care, one was in the burn unit and the other eight have light injuries, said the doctor. None of the injuries are life-threatening, said the doctor, who did not give a name. Doctors in state hospitals are not allowed to speak to the media. The explosion took place in front of the Cankaya municipal building, local official Bulent Tanik said on Turkish television.

"London (CNN) -- A 40-year-old woman was arrested Thursday in south London on suspicion of terror offenses, the Metropolitan Police said. She was detained in the early hours by counterterrorism officers and taken to a police station for questioning, a police statement said. A home is also being searched. Her arrest is in connection with the alleged posting of extremist material on the Internet, the statement said. ""We are liaising with the Italian authorities to establish whether there is any link to an arrest they made earlier this morning,"" the statement added. Italian police said they had arrested a 20-year-old Moroccan-born man early Thursday in northern Italy on suspicion of planning an attack on a synagogue in Milan. Claudio Galzerano, head of the anti-terrorist unit of the Italian police, told CNN in a phone interview that the suspect, named Jarmoune Mohamed, had been detained in the city of Brescia. He is a Moroccan citizen but has lived in Italy since he was 6 years old, Galzerano said. Police found detailed plans of the synagogue on Via della Guastella in Milan on Mohamed's computer as well as information on the security measures at the site, he said. He described the operation as an ""important preventive operation"" but also said there was ""a very high risk"" that the planned attack might be carried out. Galzerano said the suspect had allegedly createdsecret discussion groups on social networks such as Facebook in which he discussed making explosive devices. Mohamed's activities had led police to place him under 24-hour surveillance, he said. Italian investigators are working with police in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in connection with the case, Galzerano said. Italian Interior Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri said in a statement that she was ""particularly glad that the operation was conducted thanks to the information from our intelligence office and foreign intelligence.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In sport, being the best is not just about the having the greatest players. Here are five teams that have gone from zeroes to heroes, and in the process left their mark on sporting history. 1. The European Ryder Cup team . The 1980 U.S. hockey team's 'Miracle on Ice' against the Soviet Union. Europe's Ryder Cup team has become renowned for upsetting the form book, frequently triumphing against higher ranked American opposition. Since European players were first allowed to join the British and Irish team for the famous golf tournament (to improve the level of competition) in 1979, the U.S. has won six times; Europe seven; and the teams have tied once. The slight edge enjoyed by Europe, however, belies the lowly status of their players in world golf. For the last tournament two years ago in Ireland, for example, the Americans boasted 68.4 world-ranking points and the top three players, including world number one, Tiger Woods. Compare this with just 47.8 ranking points for the Europeans. Even so Europe went on to achieve a record third consecutive win. The key to this success has been the camaraderie and teamwork exhibited by the Europeans. Their players have consistently rallied around their position as underdog, managing to achieve a level of togetherness made all the more surprising since the team is made up of a collection of nationalities that are better known for falling out with each other. 2. The 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team . A famous victory against a seemingly invincible Soviet Union side propelled this team of college players and amateurs to the level of national heroes. Although the U.S. team went on to win the gold medal by defeating Finland at the Winter Olympics, it was the earlier match against the Soviets that captured the popular imagination. Classed as amateurs, the Soviet players were essentially professional, and were provided with different job titles by the communist government to allow them to compete. Many of their players were considered legends of world ice hockey at the time. The U.S. team coached by Herb Brooks was, by contrast, genuinely amateur and came into the tournament in Lake Placid, New York, as rank outsiders. Their youthfulness and tenacity combined with patriotic home support saw them upset predictions, defeating the Soviets 4-3 in a match that became known as the ""Miracle on Ice."" The win over their Cold War enemies seized the imagination of the U.S. public -- it inspired two films and was voted the greatest sporting moment of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated. Dave Ogrean, former executive director of USA Hockey, called the victory ""the most transcending moment in the history of our sport in this country."" 3. The 'Crazy Gang' defeat Liverpool in the FA Cup . Nobody expected lowly Wimbledon Football Club to do anything other than turn up when they played Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Dubbed the 'Crazy Gang' by British media because of the eccentric antics of their players and staff, who included future film actor Vinnie Jones, the team was outclassed on every front. At the time Liverpool were the dominant force in English football, having won the league title that year for the seventh time in a decade. Managed by former player Kenny Dalglish and boasting a host of stars, the team was expected to cruise past Wimbledon, who had little resources and were considered something of a joke. Under the chairmanship of Lebanese businessman Samir ""Sam"" Hammam, Wimbledon earned a reputation for bizarre behaviour, with players setting fire to new signings football kits, and Hammam once offering to buy a camel for the team's striker if he scored 20 goals in a season. The practical jokes helped to foster an extraordinarily strong team spirit, however, which saw them topple Liverpool 1-0, with Wimbledon captain Dave Beasant the hero of the hour after he saved a penalty. 4. Joe's Jets win the Superbowl . When the New York Jets took on the Baltimore Colts in the 1969 Superbowl, it was the team from Baltimore that was strong favorites. The Colts had stormed the National Football League (NFL) championship, considered at the time a much stronger competition than the American Football League (AFL), headed that year by the Jets. This news, however, seemed to have escaped Joe Namath, the Jets' charismatic quarterback, who gave a ""guarantee"" a few days earlier at a news conference in Miami -- where the Superbowl was being staged -- that his team would win. True to his predictions, the Jets came out on top with Namath taking all the plaudits (Sports Illustrated described him as a ""folk hero of the new generation"") after a blistering performance that saw his team triumph 16-7. 5. The Magical Magyars . The legendary Hungarian national football team of the 1950s is still considered one of the greatest teams in the history of sport. Although many of its players -- most notably striker Ferenc Puskas, who eventually moved to Real Madrid -- went on to play in the West, during its heyday the majority of the team was drawn from the Honved club in Budapest. The Magyars remained unbeaten for an unprecedented 33 consecutive matches (a record that still stands today) finally losing out in the 1954 World Cup Final to Germany. This golden age of Hungarian football was brought to an abrupt end in 1956 by the events of the Hungarian Revolution. Puskas and some of his team mates opted to defect to Western Europe, and never played for their country again.","Europe's Ryder Cup team has often beaten the U.S. despite lower profile players .

"(CNN) -- -- The well-publicized landing of 40 Iranian Jews in Israel on Tuesday spurred glee among some Israelis and the immigrants themselves and drew public scorn from a surprising quarter in Iran -- two officials from its centuries-old Jewish community. One of them described the emigration as a ""misinformation"" campaign and defended their lives under the government of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The arrival in Israel was publicized as the largest single group to arrive in Israel from Iran since Iran's Islamic Revolution, and the immigrants traveled via an undisclosed third country. Other Iranian Jews have immigrated to Israel over the years. Anti-Semitism has been a worldwide phenomenon for centuries and the state of Israel became a homeland for Jews to escape anti-Semitic persecution. The group that sponsored the immigration is the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, based in Chicago. It says it wants to help Jews flee such persecution. The group receives money from evangelical Christians. Its founder, Rabbi Yehiel Eckstein, believes Iranian Jews face dangers, citing the words of Ahmadinejad, who has urged Israel's destruction but not by military means. There has been great criticism of Ahmadinejad by Jews across the globe for his remarks about Israel, for the government's stance toward Israel, and for the regime's sponsorship of a recent Holocaust denial seminar. Eckstein said immigrants received $10,000 each because they left behind possessions to go to Israel. Noting the evangelical support from his group, Eckstein, in fact, believes it's no ""coincidence"" that the people came to Israel on Christmas Day, which Eckstein describes as ""kind of a Christmas present to these folks from Christians in America who seek to tell Israel and the Jewish people that they're not alone."" The immigration comes at a time of great tension between Iran, whose president stoutly rejects the Jewish state's existence, and Israel, which asserts that Iran is funding terrorism, has ambitions to develop nuclear weapons, and is intent on destroying the Jewish state. But the account of the mass immigration was vehemently disputed among Jewish officials in Tehran who defend Jewish life there. The man representing Iranian Jews in Iran's parliament on Wednesday disputed the notion of an organized immigration of Iranian Jews to Israel, saying he would have known about such a development. Iranian MP Morris Motamed told CNN that he and Ciamak Morehsadegh, the director of the Tehran Jewish Community, had issued a statement condemning the spread of false news about an evangelical organization facilitating the immigration of 40 Iranian Jews to Israel. Iranian Jews can travel anywhere they want, anytime they want, but like other Iranians they are not allowed to go to Israel, Motamed said. Even with that, some Iranian Jews may decide to travel to and from Israel via a third country to visit their families or to visit for religious reasons. However, Motamed called the news a ""misinformation"" campaign aimed at creating an atmosphere of distrust between the Muslim and Jewish communities in Iran. He said it is meant to make Iranian Jews feel unsafe and vulnerable in their own country. He said that before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian Jews numbered more than 100,000, but like other minorities their numbers diminished because of immigration. He said almost 95 percent of Iranian Jews went to the United States and as a result there is now quite a sizable Iranian Jewish community there. The remaining 5 percent, he said, went to Europe and Israel. There are as many as an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Jews remaining in Iran, the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside Israel, according to CNN's Shirzad Bozorghmehr. The U.S. State Department's 2007 report on religious freedom says the Iranian government's ""rhetoric and actions created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all non-Shi'a religious groups, most notably for Baha'i's,"" who are based in the Israeli city of Haifa. It also cites ""Sufi Muslims, evangelical Christians, and members of the Jewish community."" Jews by Iranian constitutional law have the right to practice their religion and ""with some exception,"" there has been scant government restriction and interference with religious practices, the report said. However, ""members of these recognized minority religious groups have reported government imprisonment, harassment, intimidation, and discrimination based on their religious beliefs."" Jewish education has been tougher to carry out, there has been a rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric, and assaults on two synagogues, the report said. Their contact with or support for the state of Israel has been squelched ""out of fear of reprisal."" ""Recent anti-American and anti-Israeli demonstrations included the denunciation of Jews, as opposed to the past practice of denouncing only 'Israel' and ""Zionism,"" adding to the threatening atmosphere for the community,"" the report said. In the Islamic Republic's Jewish community, there is a different view from voices emerging. Morehsadegh described the Jewish community in Tehran as alive and well, with 20 synagogues, more than eight butcher shops, two restaurants, and four youth groups. ""There is no doubt that the Holocaust happened,"" he said. ""But we disagree with the superpowers who have misused this incident to their own benefit."" E-mail to a friend .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's House and Senate approved a resolution Tuesday to install the country's vice president as head of state until ailing President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua recovers enough to resume his duties. But the Executive Council, made up of government ministers, must still approve the resolution before Vice President Goodluck Jonathan can become acting president. The Executive Council is likely to discuss the matter at a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday. The absence of Yar'Adua, who left Nigeria for medical treatment in Saudi Arabia in November, has created a power vacuum in Africa's most populous country, observers have said. It also sparked demonstrations in the nation's capital, Abuja, where protesters demanded a constitutional order on his absence and evidence about his true state of health. But Nigeria's Attorney General Michael Aondoakaa insisted Tuesday there has been no power vacuum. ""The main issue is that there must be ways of resolving our progress constitutionally,"" Aondoakaa told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""The system is working because nobody has taken up arms."" He added, ""What is important now is to move the country forward ... for the three arms of government to come and support the vice president to carry out his duties."" Aondoakaa's stance was criticized by a Nobel Prize winner for literature, Wole Soyinka of Nigeria, who accused the attorney general of talking ""from all four compass points of his mouth. ... He's told so many untruths."" Soyinka accused the ruling People's Democratic Party of taking advantage of the president's absence. ""The issue is that certain elements within the ruling party love this hiatus, they love the headlessness of government because they can proceed to loot and create their own little empires while the president is away,"" he said. Soyinka predicted that the PDP will not give up its current position easily. ""They're going to find other forms of delaying tactics, and I'm talking about certain criminal elements within the ruling party,"" he said. ""They are the ones really responsible for this."" Soyinka added that Nigerians may soon need to embark on a campaign of civil disobedience to stop the PDP, which he described as ""an illegitimate, unelected, corrupt and murderous party."" A failure to implement measures such as electoral reform -- designed to put the country back on a democratic path -- could foment such a campaign, he said. ""There's got to be a review,"" he said. ""Failing all this, the citizenry will embark on a civil disobedience campaign. I see no other course for the nation."" Soyinka said such a campaign would begin on a small scale and escalate until ""so-called legislators"" are made to live up to their responsibilities. ""It'll mean a de-recognition of the government to start with, flouting the law wherever possible,"" he said. ""We've demonstrated that the rallies need not be violent as long as civil rights are not trampled on."" The president is being treated for inflammation of tissue around the heart, a condition that was diagnosed in November after he complained of chest pain in Abuja. He was taken to King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he had undergone his last checkup in August, his doctor said. Yar'Adua said at the time he did not intend to resign while in Saudi Arabia, but no further news came from the president for almost two months until January 13, when he gave the BBC an interview from his hospital bed. In a frail voice, Yar'Adua sought to assure his countrymen that he was getting better and intended to return soon to power. Nigeria's Senate expressed concern ""that there had been no formal communication to the National Assembly"" -- as required by the nation's constitution -- to ""empower the vice president to act and perform the functions of the president,"" Voice of Nigeria reported. But Aondoakaa, the attorney general, has said the president did not need to write such a letter. In addition to internal discord over its missing president, the oil-rich nation has faced international heat after one of its citizens allegedly attempted to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner on Christmas Day. U.S. authorities then required passengers on U.S.-bound flights from Nigeria to undergo enhanced security measures. A senior U.S. administration official said Nigeria fell into the U.S. Transportation Security Administration category of ""state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest.""

"London (CNN) -- An autopsy to determine what killed singer Amy Winehouse will not be scheduled before Monday morning, London's Metropolitan Police said Sunday. ""Inquiries continue into the circumstances of the death,"" police said in a statement.  At this stage, the 27-year-old's death ""is being treated as unexplained and there have been no arrests in connection with the incident,"" police said. The singer, beloved for her talent but infamous for erratic public behavior, arrests and drug problems, was found dead at her apartment in London on Saturday, police and her publicist confirmed. Winehouse's family said in a statement Sunday it ""has been left bereft by the loss of Amy, a wonderful daughter, sister, niece. She leaves a gaping hole in our lives. We are coming together to remember her and we would appreciate some privacy and space at this terrible time."" ""We are trying to come to terms with the death of a dear friend and colleague, the most amazing artist and talent,"" her management company, Metropolis Music, said Sunday. ""We will always remember Amy as a vibrant, funny, caring young woman who made everyone around her feel welcome. We have lost a very special person, part of our family."" Winehouse's soulful, throaty vocals brought the British musician stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her Top 10 hit ""Rehab"" -- won her notoriety. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia. Winehouse died at the same age as four other music legends. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison each died of drug overdoses when they were 27. Kurt Cobain was 27 when he committed suicide, soon after his release from rehab. Police were called to Winehouse's Camden Square apartment just after 4 p.m. Saturday in response to report of ""a woman found deceased,"" police said. ""Everyone who is involved with Amy is shocked and devastated,"" Winehouse spokesman Chris Goodman said.  ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends."" Her father, MItch, got word of his daughter's death Saturday while in New York preparing for a Monday night show with his band at the Blue Note club, his publicist said.  He immediately canceled the performance and caught a flight back to London, the publicist said. Winehouse's official website on Sunday carried nothing but a black-and-white photo of the singer. On Saturday, a statement on the site had said Winehouse was ""withdrawing from all scheduled performances."" ""Rehab,"" in which she sang ""They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no,"" helped form the public's view of Winehouse. But she told CNN in a 2007 interview, ""I don't care enough about what people think of me to conform to anything."" The London-born singer became a picture of a tattooed teenage rebel after she was expelled from a prestigious performing arts school. Her first album, ""Frank,"" debuted in 2003, when the singer-songwriter was 19. International success came with her 2007 album ""Back To Black.""  She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of ""Rehab."" Winehouse's volatile marriage to Blake Fielder-Civil took a toll on the singer's career. The couple divorced in 2009 after a stormy two years filled by drug addiction and arrests. Winehouse's parents went public with their efforts to help their daughter, telling the London Telegraph in 2009 that she was on the road to recovery. ""A gradual recovery, which is good,"" Winehouse's father told the Telegraph. ""With slight backward steps -- not drug backward steps, more drink backward steps if you follow my drift. I think that will be the pattern of recovery."" The organization that awards the Grammys issued a statement Saturday calling Winehouse ""a dynamic performer and musician who seamlessly blended rock, jazz, pop, and soul and created a sound all her own."" ""Her rich, soulful and unique voice reflected her honest songwriting and earned her a devoted fan following, critical acclaim, and the genuine respect and admiration of her musical peers,"" the Recording Academy statement said.  ""She will forever be remembered for her immense talent, and her music will live on for generations to come. Our deepest sympathies go out to her family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.""

"(CNN) -- A South Boston priest has been placed on administrative leave after his arrest on child pornography charges, which allegedly involved the use of a parish rectory computer. Rev. Andrew Urbaniak, pastor of Our Lady of Czestochowa, is barred from functioning as a priest and was arraigned Wednesday after detectives uncovered pornographic images of young girls on his computer. The children are thought to be between the ages of 8 and 10, police said. When detectives entered the rectory on Tuesday, they apparently found the computer was in the process of downloading material from a peer-to-peer network, according to prosecutors. The nature of that material is not clear. Urbaniak, 39, was arrested Tuesday afternoon after a two-month police investigation of peer-to-peer networks, which involved state troopers assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. He is charged with one count of possession of child pornography and one count of distributing images of a child in the nude. During the investigation, authorities said they noticed files with names that included phrases such as ""pre-teen,"" ""young,"" ""little,"" ""pedo,"" ""pedofilia"" and ""lolitas."" The files were hosted by a computer that was eventually linked to the computer at the Dorchester Avenue rectory, authorities said. ""These charges are serious, and they are especially disturbing given the defendant's position of trust,"" said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. ""They reflect sexually explicit images of very young girls who are, legally and morally, incapable of consenting to such exploitation."" Urbaniak is being held on $10,000 cash bail. Once released, he is required to wear a GPS monitoring device, surrender his passport, be barred from Internet use and have no contact with children younger than 16. Urbaniak has not been charged with enticing a child, and no victims have come forward. His attorney, Jeffrey Denner, said it is their ""intention to assess and obtain all the evidence."" ""The whole situation is very disquieting and very saddening,"" he added. ""We are obviously treating it with the gravity and respect it deserves.""","NEW: Andrew Urbaniak isn't allowed to function as a priest; he was arraigned Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A South African man was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for the killing of white supremacist leader Eugene Terreblanche, a lawyer in the case said. Chris Mahlangu was convicted on four counts including murder, for which he got life, lawyer Zola Majavu said. Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB), was killed in April 2010 following an apparent dispute over wages with workers on his farm. Terreblanche, 69, was bludgeoned with clubs and stabbed with a machete during the attack at his farm near Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West province, police said. The trial began in October. Police charged Mahlangu and a 16-year-old in the death. It was not immediately clear what sentence the minor got. The AWB is best known for trying to block South Africa's effort to end apartheid. The group used terrorist tactics in a bid to stall the country's first all-race vote in 1994, killing more than 20 people in a wave of bombings on the eve of the elections. Terreblanche was convicted of a 1996 attempted murder of a black man who worked as a security guard on his farm. He served about two-thirds of a five-year sentence.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's beleaguered prime minister, Manmohan Singh, on Monday sought to defend allocations of coal fields without competitive bidding as opposition lawmakers called for his resignation over an audit report that says the exchequer may have lost up to $33 billion by not auctioning off the mines. Singh's statement to parliament was drowned out by shouts of ""the prime minister must resign"" as members from the opposition alliance walked into the well of the chamber in protest. At the same time, his office posted short excerpts from a statement on its Twitter account calling the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) ""clearly disputable."" Singh was the guardian of the coal ministry for part of the period reviewed by the CAG in its report, which was released last week. According to the audit, private companies that were sold the coal blocs could have seen a potential profit of $33 billion. ""A part of this financial gain could have accrued to the national exchequer ... ,"" the CAG wrote, noting delays in adopting bidding as the process to award coal mines could have caused the loss. In his defense, Singh also cited a lack of consensus with several opposition-ruled states over switching to auction during the period assessed by the auditor. ""I want to assure hon'ble (honorable) members that as the minister in charge, I take full responsibility for the decisions of the ministry. I wish to say that any allegations of impropriety are without basis and unsupported by the facts,"" the prime minister said in his statement, whose full text was later published on the Indian government's website. ""The CAG report has criticized the government for not implementing this decision speedily enough. In retrospect, I would readily agree that in a world where things can be done by fiat, we could have done it faster. But, given the complexities of the process of consensus building in our parliamentary system, this is easier said than done,"" he said. Singh also questioned the CAG's methods of estimating the loss to the government and profit to private companies. India depends heavily on coal for power, and with its rising population and industrialization, it is struggling to meet demands. Singh was coal minister between 2006 and 2009, when many of the sales assessed in the CAG report took place. The auditor, however, did not indict the prime minister. Its findings, nonetheless, paralyzed the Indian parliament, with members from the opposition group led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party mounting a vigorous attack on Singh, whose government is already under fire for a series of corruption scandals. ""The prime minister's statement didn't resolve our contention. Instead, it strengthened it,"" said Sushma Swaraj, the opposition leader in the lower house of the national assembly. She said Singh's government, now in its second term, took years to enforce a policy of competitive bidding that was conceived in 2004, when his government first came to power. ""We demand the prime minister should take moral responsibility and resign,"" Swaraj told reporters.","New audit report says lack of auctioning of mines may have cost government billions .

"(EW.com) -- Okay, that may actually just be a line from Kermit the Frog in ""The Muppet Christmas Carol,"" but in the case of ""America's Got Talent,"" NBC's annual summer competition that manages to be the spiritual heir to ""The Gong Show,"" a poignant homage to vaudeville, and a grotesque Felliniesque carnival — sometimes all at the same time — it's especially true. Season 7, which wrapped tonight, saw both the departure of longtime judge Sharon Osbourne and the crowning of a new talent shortly to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting tourists of Las Vegas. This year, the finalists included two performance painters -- one whose medium was sand, thus becoming the first sand painter to reach an audience beyond your local Renaissance fair -- an ""earth harpist,"" a dog trick act, a kiddie dance troupe, and a comedian who found Howard Stern's hair to be the greatest source of fodder for his act. But there could be only one winner. And that was... [SPOILER ALERT for those who haven't watched tonight's finale yet] . 'Big Brother': Evicted houseguest is... The Olate Dogs! Yes, America deemed the act of two dog trainers and their cuddly, trick-performing canines--their act consists of the pooches bounding through hoops, jumping rope on their hind legs, and riding in toy SUVs--as the worthiest finalists. I suppose the result shouldn't be a shock since we live in the age of cute-pet YouTube videos, but it's hard to imagine anyone paying top dollar to see them perform in Vegas, the career-launching prize of all ""America's Got Talent"" winners. Runner-up Tom Cotter, a comedian who relies on one-liner jokes about the ethics of the Prince kissing an unconscious Sleeping Beauty, seemed like a better choice for the Strip. He delivered a tag-team bit with Joan Rivers mocking Howard Stern (the shockjock has ""gay pirate hair""!) that cried out for extensive rim-shot accompaniment. Genie Francis exits 'Young and Restless' Blue Man Group, which I assume to be former ""America's Got Talent"" winners themselves, added their DayGlo whimsy to the proceedings, as did Justin Bieber and reality-competition show staples Flo Rida and One Republic, showing that ""America's Got Talent"" is making an aggressive play to usurp ""Dancing With the Stars"" as the series with the most filler on TV. If you watched, are you happy with the outcome? Would you pay top dollar to watch top dogs jump rope for 90 minutes? Or do you hope that this act, like virtually every ""America's Got Talent"" winner before it, stays in Vegas...and is never heard from again?

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A U.S. Marine in Iraq has been removed from duty amid complaints that he was handing out coins with Bible verses at an American checkpoint, the military said Thursday. A military spokesman said Iraqis in Falluja complained that the Marine was giving the coins, which were printed in Arabic, to people at an entry control point in Falluja. U.S. military regulations prohibit religious proselytizing. ""This has our full attention,"" said Col. James L. Welsh, chief of staff of Multi-National Force, West. ""We deeply value our relationship with the local citizens and share their concerns over this serious incident."" At least one of the coins is stamped with the words ""Where will you spend eternity?"" according to a report published Thursday by McClatchy Newspapers. The other side of the coin reportedly contains a verse from John 3:16 that reads, ""For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life."" Several Falluja residents said they were given the coins over a two-day period and complained that U.S. troops, whom they consider foreign occupiers, were acting as Christian missionaries. ""Regulations prohibit members of the coalition force from proselytizing any religion, faith or practices,"" said Col. Bill Buckner, a coalition spokesman. ""Our troops are trained on those guidelines before they deploy."" A military statement said ""appropriate action"" will be taken if the reports are substantiated. The reports stoked religious concerns in Iraq just weeks after Iraqi police discovered that a U.S. soldier had used the Quran, Islam's holy book, for target practice. The U.S. commander in Baghdad took the unusual step of holding a public ceremony and reading a letter of apology from the soldier, a sniper section leader, to local Iraqi leaders. Many in attendance were members and leaders of Sunni militias that the U.S. military has courted to help fight al Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgents. Sunnis often face criticism from other Iraqis for cooperating with American troops. Falluja, also a mostly Sunni city, was the scene of bitter and bloody fighting early in the Iraq war between U.S. troops, al Qaeda in Iraq and Sunni insurgents loyal to Saddam Hussein.","Iraqis say Marine passed out coins featuring Bible verses written in Arabic .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Moroccan man who admitted plotting to blow up the U.S. Capitol in a suicide attack was offered ""martyrdom payments"" for his parents by his undercover FBI handlers, according to the man's lawyers. Amine El Khalifi, 29, will be sentenced Friday and under the terms of a plea agreement he'll receive a sentence ranging from 25 to 30 years. In a sentencing memo filed Friday, El Khalifi's lawyers argued for the lower sentence and stressed he received financial support which freed him up to participate in a plot. The document said El Khalifi was financially strapped living in Virginia and worried about sending money home to his parents in Morocco, who had suffered financial reversals. Two men El Khalifi knew as Hussien and Yusuf ""promised to take care of Mr. El Khalifi's family in Morocco by sending them $500 per month to commence after the attack was completed,"" according to El Khalifi's lawyers. The document also states El Khalifi was given rent and grocery money amounting to at least $5,700 from September 2011 to February 2012. El Khalifi thought the men could assist him in a terror plot, but they were actually FBI agents. El Khalifi was arrested on February 17th after he had take possession of what he thought was a suicide vest and a MAC-10 semiautomatic handgun. Both had been rendered inoperable by the FBI. The defense lawyers contend their client, who pleaded guilty in June, ""bears no ill-will against the American people"" and believed God had called on him to commit a violent act. ""He is relieved that his attempted crime was foiled and that no one was actually injured,"" according to the court filing. According to the lawyers, the actions of the FBI do not constitute entrapment. However, the lawyers said El Khalifi was ""enabled by the FBI, who as part of its 'sting,' helped Mr. El Khalifi with the means, method and motivation for the attack."" The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia would not comment on whether the FBI promised El Khalifi ""martyrdom payments"" as part of its ruse. However, prosecutors filed their own sentencing memo arguing El Khalifi should get the higher sentence of 30 years. ""The defendant, on his own initiative, selected the target and date of the attack, and engaged in surveillance to ensure that his attack caused maximum casualties,"" the prosecutors wrote. According to the government, it is very lucky the FBI and not actual extremists came into the picture and started working with El Khalifi. ""There is every reason to believe that he would have taken any opportunity he encountered in the future to commit mass murder,"" said the prosecution's filing.

"(CNN) -- Libya's rebel leaders claimed Monday they had captured three of Moammar Gadhafi's sons, including Saif al-Islam, who is wanted on war crimes charges by the International Criminal Court. But shortly afterwards, Saif appeared in public in Tripoli, where he spoke to reporters -- raising serious questions about the reliability of the rebels' account of events. A day later it remains unclear whether Saif al-Islam was ever in rebel hands, while another Gadhafi son, Mohammed, reportedly escaped from rebel custody. It is also uncertain whether Saadi, the third son the rebels claimed to have captured, was in their custody either. So how much does this dent the credibility of rebels? And can the Libyan people and the international community put their faith in the Transitional National Council (TNC) to lead the nation if the Gadhafi regime falls? Observers say the reported arrest -- and prompt reappearance -- of Saif al-Islam are at the least an embarrassing distraction for the rebels as they seek to take control of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The International Criminal Court, whose chief prosecutor told CNN Monday it had been talking to the rebels about transferring Saif al-Islam to its custody, by Tuesday was insisting it had never confirmed his capture, while Western diplomats faced questions over their wisdom in backing the rebel leadership. Professor Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics, told CNN he did not believe the rebels had intended to mislead the wider world over the arrest of Saif al-Islam, seen as his father's heir apparent. But, he said, the confusion was of great concern because it betrayed a lack of cohesion and competence in the Transitional National Council's leadership and exposed the group's structural weakness. Rebel groups and militias were acting independently rather than as a unified military force, he said, and with that came a risk that the rebel assault would disintegrate into urban warfare and civil strife. He said the rebel leadership needed to ""up its game"" and could not repeat the lack of openness shown when the rebel government's military commander, Gen Abdel Fattah Younis, died in murky circumstances in Benghazi last month. ""The lack of transparency raises serious questions. This is a de facto government -- they must get it. This is not amateurs' time,"" he said. ""They cannot afford to really make so many mistakes because once they lose their credibility, it's very difficult to repair."" Mahmoud Shammam, minister of information for the National Transitional Council, acknowledged that the situation over the reported capture of Saif Gadhafi was confusing. ""We admit our communications was not clear,"" he told CNN, saying it had been representatives in Benghazi who stated Saif was under arrest, rather than the prime minister. The rebels did not know if Saif al-Islam Gadhafi had been arrested and escaped, he said, so they would have to confirm what happened with the leaders engaged in the fighting in Tripoli. But, he said, confusion like this occurred in conflict situations, adding that the rebel forces were entering a big city with many different centers of operation. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday that the rebels had the confidence of the American government despite the conflicting information over Monday's arrests. ""We have definitely found them to be credible and reliable interlocutors,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer from Rome, saying the United States had been in close contact with the leadership in Benghazi, the rebels' eastern base. Washington joined Britain and other Western powers in recognizing the NTC last month as the legitimate governing authority in Libya, adding to the pressure on Moammar Gadhafi to relinquish power to the rebels. ""Clearly in a situation as fluid as this that is evolving rapidly, there's going to be confusion, there's going to be misinformation, and those that are on the ground in Tripoli may or may not be in full and timely communication with the leadership outside of Tripoli,"" Rice said. ""Generally speaking, we've found in all of our engagements with the (NTC) that their leadership is reliable, principled and is working to do the right things."" Saad Djebbar, a lawyer who negotiated the release in Scotland two years ago of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the Libyan convicted of blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie, echoed the view that it was unfair to judge the rebels as unreliable on the basis of miscommunications on the ground in Tripoli. ""We have to focus on the bigger picture now and see what the council does next,"" he told CNN. Djebbar believes the NTC should focus on getting food and medical supplies to the people in areas of Libya no longer under Gadhafi's control, in order to demonstrate that life will be better under a new government. And in order to reassure their allies in the West, the NTC must ensure law and order are established in the areas liberated from Gadhafi's forces, he said. Police and security forces should be retrained so they understand they exist to serve the people rather than the regime, he added. The specter of Iraq's descent into violence and sectarian strife after the fall of Saddam Hussein hang over Libya -- and Djebbar sees the international community as having a key role to play in ensuring history is not repeated. ""The United States, United Kingdom, France and others should work now with practical steps to make sure that Libyans feel that their country has become a better place,"" he said. ""This is not Iraq."" The credibility of a new government will rely on its swift formation and the inclusion of respected members of different communities, tribes, professions and religious groups, he said, to act as ""trustees of the revolution and its values."" Omar Ashour, director of Middle East Studies for the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, said the rebels were trying to learn from their mistakes -- and the misfortunes of other countries such as Iraq -- in order to keep the trust of their international partners. Speaking from Cairo, on his way to Tripoli, Ashour told CNN he believed the critical issue was one of transparency, so that the rebels could avoid the kind of damaging conflicting accounts that emerged over the death of Younis. And however the NTC does, he believes the resulting government will be better than the corrupt regime headed by Gadhafi over the past four decades. ""It's a huge task but to be honest they are the best that we have in Libya at the moment,"" he said. Gerges agrees that it would be wrong to judge the NTC too harshly for a handful of errors in its early days. Not only is the movement less than a year old, he pointed out, but it is made up of many disparate ideological, social, regional and tribal groups that have yet to fully consolidate into institutions. Gerges believes a functioning and inclusive government will develop given time, provided peace can be restored in Libya and that the TNC can translate its rhetoric into concrete policies. ""If I were to gamble, I would gamble on the rebels really rising to the occasion,"" he said. CNN's Krsna Harilela contributed to this report.","The rebels said they had captured three of Gadhafi's sons, including Saif al-Islam .

"REMOTE WEST TIMOR (CNN)  -- Maria's labored breath echoes within the walls of her family's mud hut. Her tiny, bony hands open and close in slow claw-like motions. Baby Maria weighs just 10 pounds at 15 months due to malnutrition in West Timor. She's 15 months old, but weighs just 10 pounds -- one of countless children under the age of 5 facing severe malnutrition in Indonesia's West Timor. A typical infant weighs about 24 pounds at 15 months. ""Maria sleeps most of the time. Sometimes she cries but not often,"" her 25-year-old mother Adolphina Fao says softly. Watch how malnutrition devastates region » . Maria is fighting to live, wasting away in her remote village where aid officials say climate change has brought on a severe drought in recent years. It's nearly impossible for residents to live off the land like they have for generations. ""It's hard to feed her,"" her mother says. ""Some are good days, some are bad. Sometimes she eats a whole plate, sometimes nothing."" As Fao speaks, she spoons glutinous rice into Maria's tiny mouth. The baby spits out most of it. Aid officials say Maria is one example of a chronic crisis that has been worsening in West Timor, the Indonesian portion of the island of Timor that is home to about 1.5 million people.  See photographs of plight in this remote area » . According to a joint survey by aid groups Church World Service, Helen Keller International and CARE, more than 50 percent of children under 5 in West Timor are suffering from malnutrition. In some areas it's as high as 70 percent -- a higher percentage than areas of Africa. Of those, nearly 1 in every 10 children suffer from acute malnutrition, meaning they are near death, according to organizers. The study also found that 61 percent of the children suffer from stunted growth. ""Stunting is the result of extended periods of inadequate food intake, poor dietary quality, increased morbidity or a combination of these factors,"" the study says. ""This finding indicates that the diet has been very poor quality for a very long time."" Aid groups also warn that the situation is likely to worsen because of rising global food prices. Here, far-flung villages lie nestled in deceptively lush green landscape, with no real roads, no electricity and no running water. Barely clothed children play in the dirt. According to the survey, more than 90 percent of households don't have enough food. Families try to farm the land, but the prolonged drought has destroyed their crops, cutting off their main food supply. That results in less food for each house, further eroding the supply of much-needed nutrition for young children. ""Nowadays the dry season is lasting longer and longer,"" says Vincensius Surma, the senior program manager for Church World Service, a global humanitarian agency. ""In 2006 and 2007, the dry season lasted for a year."" Dry riverbeds around the region are testament to his statement. Villagers have to walk for miles for water. Surma travels from remote village to remote village just to follow up on cases that his agency is treating. One of the families he revisits is Salmoun Ton's. Two of his three children are malnourished. His eldest child has stunted growth. At 8 years old, she's barely taller than her healthy 4-year-old sister. His youngest was severely malnourished and is still drastically underweight. Ton, a corn farmer, says that his crops aren't producing enough to sustain his family. ""It makes me sad, really sad. As a parent, I feel that I can't properly care for them,"" Ton says. Further compounding the crisis is a lack of basic education and health care, proper sanitary habits, and inadequate aid, according to humanitarian officials. On this visit, Surma finds out that Ton sold their fresh eggs -- a major source of protein -- to buy instant noodles. He then tries to explain basic nutrition to the family. ""We're trying to do everything that we can, but for now the results are definitely not enough,"" Surma says. Aid organizations have unsuccessfully battled to bring this tragedy into the international spotlight. There are some donations coming in, but the funds and the resources simply aren't enough given the magnitude of the crisis. Organizations like Church World Service and CARE have established feeding and education centers to try to combat the crisis. The Indonesian government is also trying to address the crisis by supplying vitamin supplements to hard-hit families and other help, but aid groups say there is little cross coordination. ""We can't implement our mid- or long-term plan for this case because ... so many children are casualties of malnutrition in this region,"" Surma says. The main fear is that unless something drastic is done now, whole generations could be lost to acute and chronic malnutrition.","Indonesia's West Timor faces crisis: 50 percent of children malnourished .

"(CNN) -- It started as a hefty severance bonus for lawmakers -- quietly tucked into a Kenyan finance bill passed last week. A few days later, angry demonstrators gathered outside parliament offices in the capital of Nairobi. They carried placards reading ""greedy hyenas"" and hollered ""thieves"" as members of parliament dashed into their offices. Kenyan parliament members, among the highest paid in the continent, voted for a send-off bonus of about $120,000 each for when they leave office. Read more: Lavish and sleek: Kenya's prime property market boom . They already make about $10,000 in salary and tax-free allowances per month. An average Kenyan makes about $1,800 annually, and would have to work for 67 years to earn the bonus amount. The proposal prompted calls for protests on social media as Kenyans implored the president to veto the bill, which passed days after doctors' strikes for higher wages. ""Our parliament members are pigs,"" said John Kamau, 32. ""Our doctors and teachers were on strike for weeks. The government said there were no funds to meet all their demands. And yet they have funds to award themselves these packages?"" It was unclear how the proposed bonuses would be funded, but lawmakers called for a 10% increase in taxes in the same parliament session. Hours after protesters took to the streets, President Mwai Kibaki vetoed the proposal Tuesday night. ""The president objected to the amendment on the grounds that it was first unconstitutional and that in the prevailing economic circumstances in the country, it is unaffordable,"" the president's office said in a statement. ""Coming shortly after the increment of salaries for teachers and doctors, the severance pay for parliamentarians would lead to an unsustainable wage bill at a time when the country requires massive resources to ... meet other competing demands."" Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who is a presidential contender in next year's election, said he is against the bonus. The Kenyan National Assembly comprises 224 seats, but not all legislators voted for the bonus on October 4. Some legislators rejected the proposal and applauded the president's decision. ""The president's decline to assent to the finance bill confirms that the citizens' voice matters,"" said Martha Karua, a parliament member and presidential candidate. ""Let's keep vigilance and together slay impunity."" The proposal violates the constitution, which mandates that parliament should not set its own pay, according to human rights groups. ""It's very telling that they can hike their bonus at night quietly and teachers had to strike for three weeks,"" said Edward Mburu, 38, who lives in Nairobi. ""You can see we are dealing with selfish people. People are angry ... I hope it translates into conscious voting."" The east African nation is scheduled to hold elections in March. It will be the first general poll since postelection violence left hundreds dead in 2008 after disputed results.

"(CNN) -- Edgar Davids made a successful return to playing action after a two-year absence by leading minnows Barnet to its first league win of the season. Barnet, which plays in League Two in England, had failed to win any of its previous 12 league games and was beaten 4-1 in Davids' first match in charge last weekend. The 39-year-old was appointed as joint Head Coach of the strugglers last week alongside Mark Robson, who arrived at Underhill at the start of the season. 'Pitbull' Davids joins Barnet . And after installing himself as captain and picking up his trademark booking, Davids helped Barnet to an impressive 4-0 win over Northampton Town. Davids, who had been coaching street soccer in London, had not played competitively since appearing for Crystal Palace back in October 2010. But his presence boosted a Barnet side, which started the night rooted to the foot of the league table and contemplating a fight against relegation. The Dutchman, who has won league titles in Italy and the Netherlands, also lifted the Champions League trophy during his earlier days with Ajax. Nicknamed 'Pitbull' it was the tenacious nature of Davids' play which endeared him to the public and helped him win 74 international caps for the Netherlands between 1994 and 2005. While Davids has been used to gracing the San Siro and Camp Nou, he was forced to encounter the infamous Underhill slope for the very first time. But even that failed to stop him as he lasted the full 90 minutes in what was a perfect return to professional football.","Edgar Davids makes his comeback for League Two side Barnet .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Secret Service scandal involving agents who hired prostitutes in Colombia did not harm presidential security, according to an investigation conducted by the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security. ""Although we found that these agents engaged in misconduct, our investigation developed no evidence to suggest that the actions of USSS (U.S. Secret Service) personnel in Cartagena compromised the safety and security of the president or any sensitive information during this trip,"" Charles Edwards wrote to House and Senate members concerned about the matter. The findings support previous statements by the Secret Service that the actions of some agents who were in Colombia in advance of President Barack Obama's arrival for an April trip did not endanger the president. Edwards said he does not plan to make the report public -- in accordance with his office's policy. But he provided some of the results. Six women received money. As was previously known, an agent refused to pay one of the women who summoned a police officer. Another agent ended up paying the woman. Four women asked for money but did not receive any, while three others sought no payment. Prostitution is legal in Colombia. But the news that some Secret Service agents were drinking heavily and taking prostitutes back to their hotel rooms raised security concerns and tarnished the reputation of the agency charged with protecting the president. Edwards' letter also raised the possibility that two others involved in presidential trip preparations may have ""had contact with foreign nationals."" ""Although allegations related to the non-USSS (U.S. Secret Service) personnel were outside the scope of the investigation, one of these employees is a Department of Defense employee affiliated with the White House Communication Agency and the other, whose employment status was not verified, may have been affiliated with the White House advance operation,"" Edwards wrote to House and Senate members interested in the matter. Edwards said a hotel registry led investigators to suspect the two might have come into contact with foreign nationals. He wrote to members of Congress that the IG's mandate was just to look into the actions of the Secret Service so there was no further investigation. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine issued a statement saying she was ""troubled that the IG's findings reveal White House personnel may have been involved."" She said the White House press secretary said on April 23 that a review by its counsel's office concluded there were ""no credible allegations of misconduct by anyone on the White House advance team or the White House staff."" ""This raises concerns about the credibility of the White House investigation,"" said Collins, the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee. The White House denied staffers were involved in the incidents involving prostitutes. ""As we've said for months, the White House review concluded that no members of the White House advance team, either staff or volunteers, engaged in inappropriate conduct during the President's trip to Colombia,' said spokesman Eric Schultz. A senior administration official said inaccurate hotel records implicated a volunteer working for White House advance. The White House review determined the volunteer ""did not engage in any inappropriate behavior,"" the official said. According to an August report by U.S. Southern Command, a total of 12 service members brought prostitutes to hotel rooms prior to the Obama trip. Seven U.S. Army soldiers and two Marines were notified they would receive what the military calls ""non-judicial punishment"" for misconduct. A member of the Air Force got a letter of reprimand. The miltary said at the time it was continuing the investigation into the role of two members of the Navy in the scandal. Thirteen Secret Service Agents were implicated in the prostitution scandal, including one who self-reported. Nine agents left their jobs or are in the process of being terminated. Four agents were cleared and returned to duty. CNN's Lesa Jansen, Adam Levine and Mike Mount contributed to this report .","Homeland Security acting inspector general issues report .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- For a first-time candidate in one of the tightest and most closely watched Senate races, there may not be a better opportunity to raise your profile than a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic convention as an opening act for former President Bill Clinton . But that's where Elizabeth Warren stood on Wednesday night in Charlotte where she delivered a strident speech that brought a packed convention arena to its feet in thunderous appreciation. ""Americans are fighters. We are tough, resourceful and creative. If we have the chance to fight on a level playing field — where everyone pays a fair share and everyone has a real shot — then no one can stop us,"" Warren said. A Harvard law professor, Warren is challenging Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, for the seat he won in a 2010 special election to replace the late Democrat Ted Kennedy. It has been a tight race for the better part of a year, and Warren aimed key parts of her nationally televised address to Bay State voters. Warren was best known before her campaign as a watchdog of the government's corporate bailout program, a top financial adviser to President Barack Obama, and the force behind a high-profile agency borne from the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. CNN Fact Check: The $2,000 question ... She focused most of her convention appearance on the middle class, a major theme for Democrats at their convention and on the campaign trail. ""For many years now, our middle class has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered,"" she said. ""People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged."" While she didn't mention Brown in her speech, Warren went after the more conservative Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican opponent in November who she characterized as an uncompromising ally of Wall Street who would raise taxes on the middle class. ""Mitt Romney wants to give billions in breaks to big corporations — but he and Paul Ryan would pulverize financial reform, voucher-ize Medicare, and vaporize Obamacare,"" she said of the former Massachusetts governor and his running mate. Warren repeated a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail, taking aim at Romney's infamous statement that ""corporations are people."" ""No, Governor Romney,"" she said. ""Corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die. And that matters."" Well under way for about a year, Warren's race is one of the most expensive Senate campaigns in the country. Since entering the contest, Warren has raised a massive $28 million, with Brown also taking in more than $19 million. The question now is whether her speech will give her a boost to put her ahead of Brown. When Warren entered the contest a year ago, she quickly rose to the ranks of widely known and beloved Democrats, having already been a target of congressional Republicans for taking on Wall Street, a key GOP constituency. Political observers have described the race as crucial for determining control of the Senate. Democrats hold a four-seat margin in the 100-seat chamber. Additionally, two Independents reliably caucus with Democrats. The Senate campaign has largely grown into a competition over which candidate is the toughest advocate for everyday people. Republicans, however, try to frame her as a liberal ideologue with little to no centrist appeal. Warren got big spotlight at the convention, while Brown has not tied himself so closely to his party. Brown didn't make a high-profile speech at last week's GOP convention and he is less than shy about asserting his independent spirit as a Republican in typically Democratic Massachusetts. He launched a website this week critical of Warren on taxes and other issues. Progressive group hits milestone in support of Warren . Obama sings high praises for Warren .

"(CNN) -- A flurry of last-minute legal maneuvers Tuesday spared, for now, the life of John Ferguson, a Florida death row inmate who suffers from mental illness and at one point called himself the 'prince of God.' Ferguson, a diagnosed schizophrenic convicted of killing eight people, was scheduled to get the lethal injection Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET at a Florida State Prison. But an appeals court in Atlanta granted an emergency stay of execution Tuesday night. Florida officials then asked the Supreme Court to allow the lethal injection to proceed. Just before midnight the high court denied Florida's request, keeping in place the stay of execution, according to court documents. Some had questioned why authorities would kill a man who suffered from mental illness. Laurel Bellows, the president of the American Bar Association, released a statement earlier Tuesday saying she was concerned about how thoroughly Ferguson's competency was evaluated. ""The American Bar Association is alarmed that Florida is poised to execute John Ferguson, a man diagnosed as severely mentally ill for more than 40 years, before the constitutionality of his execution is fully evaluated."" Chris Handman, one of Ferguson's attorneys, told CNN. ""We think the court should intervene to stop that execution from going forward."" Handman said a court had earlier found that Ferguson was mentally ill and had delusions that caused him to think he is the ""Prince of God."" Ferguson is on death row for the murders of eight people in Hialeah and Carol City, Florida, in the late 1970s. Lawyers from both sides will now be allowed to file motions on the case and it was unclear when a hearing would be scheduled to decide Ferguson's fate. As the legal wrangling went on Tuesday, Florida prison officials poceeded as if the execution was going to take place, putting Ferguson in isolation and giving him his last meal. The convicted killer, prison officials said, ate a ""last meal"" of a country-fried chicken sandwich and sweet tea. CNN's Bill Mears, Nick Valencia, Joe Sutton and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","The Supreme Court upheld a stay of execution just before midnight .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- Turkey straddles Europe and Asia, is a gateway for oil and gas imports going into Europe and its economy has trebled in size over the past decade. The country's gross domestic product is now a sizable $773 billion. It also represents the fourth letter of a new acronym crafted by Goldman Sachs (the investment bank which identified the BRIC nations) to highlight stable, fast growing countries: MIST: Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey. What's happening with the BRICS? But after blistering growth of between 8.5% and 9% growth in the past two years, the country has hit a patch of turbulence. Investors are now eager to find out whether this economy can stabilize after tumbling 2.9% in the second quarter of this year. Mehmet Simsek, a former London-based investment banker and economist who is now finance minister of Turkey, is confident the current quarter represents the trough. ""A modest growth is also likely in the third quarter, but from the fourth quarter onwards a pick up seems reasonably likely,"" he told CNN. Turkey's central bank moved to support growth with a larger than expected 1.5% cut in the main interest rate Wednesday, pushing it down to 10%. Now that the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have provided more liquidity, Turkey believes there is room to maneuver. ""The move by the Turkish Central Bank should be considered in the context of both domestic and international conditions,"" Simsek said in an interview from Ankara. ""The slow down is partly micro-managed. It's part of moving to more sustainable growth."" Iran and Turkey battle for Iraq supremacy . The government is facing other issues. It is having difficulty controlling the two major outbreaks of violence at its doorstep. Syrian refugees continue to flood in, officially 80,000 to date, and there's been a flare up of the crisis with Kurdish militants in the south-eastern corner of the country. Both challenges will continue to chip away at Turkey's predominant role as the hub for East-West trade if they escalate and drag on for years rather than months. But there is a silver lining in this slow down. During the years of rapid growth, economists fretted over the country's double digit current account deficit. Imports have slowed down and exports are booming -- up 20% in the second quarter -- despite the slowdown in the European Union. From over 10% of GDP, the deficit is now down to a manageable 7.4% -- and the finance minister is aiming to get that down to 6% within the next two years.","Turkey, straddling Europe and Asia, has a gross domestic product of $773 billion .

"(CNN) -- Politics has returned to the water's edge. In the past week, we've seen how international events can suddenly dominate a political campaign, at least for a few days. The uproar in the Middle East over a YouTube video that featured anti-Islamic messages triggered widespread protests. An attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya left four people dead, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Protests in Egypt were equally intense as some people in a crowd of more than 2,000 scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy. Protests spread to 20 other countries in the Middle East and beyond. In Tunis, protesters destroyed a school run by Americans while in Afghanistan protesters lit with a torch an effigy of Obama, the U.S. leader once hailed as the president who would repair America's image in the world, and watched it burn up. Added to this brew was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's warning that, in his mind, President Obama has refused to be tough enough with Iran on its nuclear program and the prospect that Israel could take military action against Iran on its own. World: Where Obama, Romney stand on foreign policy challenges . These issues immediately entered into the campaign. Speaking of the tragedy in Libya, President Obama reiterated that ""We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification to this type of senseless violence. None."" Mitt Romney, mistakenly interpreting a statement released earlier by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt, before most of the protests, criticized the administration's statements as ""akin to apology."" Democrats complained that Romney was politicizing this tragedy. One of Obama's campaign officials, Ben LaBolt, said ""We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Gov. Romney would choose to launch a political attack."" When foreign policy crises intrude into presidential elections, they have the ability to shake up campaigns and force candidates to adjust their plans. Sometimes foreign policy can benefit an incumbent. Republican Dwight Eisenhower, who was a military hero before becoming president, survived crises overseas in October 1956 and emerged on Election Day with a decisive victory. Eisenhower had come under criticism from congressional Democrats for being so consumed by balancing the budget that he had supported military cuts that they argued would endanger the nation. In late October, Israeli and British forces attacked Egypt, which under President Gamal Abdel Nasser had taken over the Suez Canal and nationalized the British-owned corporation that managed the area. After the attacks on Egypt, and Soviet warnings that they would intervene, Eisenhower worked hard in public and behind-the-scenes to defuse the situation and force Britain, France and Israel to back down. The other crisis, which also took place in late October and early November, was when the Soviets proceeded to crush a rebellion in Hungary against the communist regime. Eisenhower decided not to respond, fearing that U.S. interference could trigger a nuclear war. Democrats argued that the refusal to respond revealed that all the talk by conservatives about liberating Eastern European people was false. In Detroit, Eisenhower's opponent, Adlai Stevenson, warned that ""whatever the provocation, aggression can no longer be tolerated in the atomic age."" But these crises only ended up bolstering the image of Eisenhower as a strong commander in chief who could coolly guide the nation through crisis. The president coasted to re-election with 457 electoral votes and 57.4 percent of the popular vote. But on other occasions, a foreign policy crisis greatly damaged the incumbent. In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The invasion, which took President Carter by surprise, played into the hands of Republicans, who were arguing that the White House didn't know how to handle these kinds of situations. Even though Carter responded to the Soviets by calling for higher levels of defense spending and announcing a buildup of forces in the Persian Gulf, Republicans accused him of doing too little too late. With U.S. hostages already being held in Iran, Ronald Reagan and other conservatives pointed to this as more evidence that Carter could not be trusted as leader. The Republican National Committee said that the ""policy of patience"" from Carter was the ""policy of weakness."" While this was certainly not the sole issue that handed Reagan his victory, it played an important role in pushing the electoral map in favor of the Republicans. What will happen if the current crises continue or get even worse? For President Obama the risks are very clear. If the situation deteriorates, these hot spots will offer the GOP evidence that the president is not an effective leader. Republicans will argue that this proves all the talk about the successes of his foreign policy record is overblown. The danger is particularly acute with Libya and Egypt, two countries that have been described as relative success stories in the Obama era of foreign policy since autocratic leaders were overthrown. These crises will also force the president to devote more attention to working in the Oval Office rather than spending time on the campaign trail. The risks are also great for Mitt Romney. The crises could easily benefit Obama just as they did Eisenhower. Anything having to do with overseas issues takes attention away from the economy, the area where Obama is most vulnerable. Opinion: What if U.S. stops policing the world? As was evident in their convention, Democrats feel they now have the so-called national security advantage. The successful drone strikes against al-Qaeda, as well as the death of Osama bin Laden, have given the White House a foundation from which to say the president is better prepared to handle these challenges. Mitt Romney has not helped his cause, since he made widely publicized mistakes during his trip abroad, such as insulting the British about how they were handling the Olympics and making controversial remarks asserting the cultural superiority of the Israelis over Palestinians. Then during his acceptance speech in Tampa, Romney failed to praise the work of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. As was the case with Eisenhower, foreign policy crises, at least in the short term, can create a rally-around-the-leader effect while raising questions about whether Romney is ready for the White House.

"(CNN) -- Pre-match handshakes, or the absence of them, overshadowed the eight fixtures in the English Premier League on Saturday as the feud between Queens Park Rangers defender, Anton Ferdinand and Chelsea captain John Terry continued at Loftus Road. Ferdinand ignored Terry as both sets of players assembled to shake hands before kick-off in what was the first meeting of the two players since the Chelsea defender was acquitted of racially abusing Ferdinand (younger brother of Rio) by a court in July. Charges against Terry were brought following an incident during the corresponding fixture in October last year. Ashley Cole, who appeared as a character witness for Terry at the trail at Westminster Magistrates Court, was also snubbed by Ferdinand. The match itself was predictably lively but yielded no goals. Chelsea had the better of the first half with Eden Hazard and Fernando Torres both testing Julio Cesar in QPR's goal. The home side had their chances in the second half but Park Ji-Sung squandered a free header while Bobby Zamora couldn't find a shot after rounding keeper Petr Cech. The result was a goalless deadlock which is enough to keep Chelsea at the top of the table with 10 points. QPR, meanwhile, are struggling in 18th place with only two points from a possible 12. Elsewhere, the blue and red halves of Manchester experienced mixed fortunes. Reigning champions, City could only manage a 1-1 draw away to Stoke City and remain in fourth place. But United are up to second after claiming all three points with a 4-0 thrashing of Wigan at Old Trafford. Panel: Police at fault in response to deadly UK stadium football crush . Paul Scholes, who was making his 700th appearance for United, scored the opening goal six minutes into the second half. It opened the floodgates, with Hernandez scoring in the 63rd minute and Alex Buttner adding a third three minutes later. Teenage striker, Nick Powell completed the rout with a thunderous drive eight minutes from the final whistle. Arsenal were in fine form against Southampton at the Emirates with Gervinho scoring a brace in a 6-1 drubbing of Southampton. Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott were also on target for the Gunners whose total was boosted by two first-half own goals by Southampton's Dutch defender Jos Hooiveld and Nathaniel Clyne. Elsewhere, Liverpool are still searching for their first win of the season after only managing a 1-1 draw away to Sunderland. Luis Suarez's 71st minute strike canceled out Steven Fletcher's first half goal to lift Liverpool one place to 17th, while Martin O'Neill's side rise to 14th. Aston Villa recorded their first victory of the season beating high-flying Swansea City 2-0 at Villa Park. Fulham beat West Bromwich Albion 3-0 at Craven Cottage, while West Ham United drew 0-0 against Norwich City at Carrow Road.","Queens Park Rangers defender refuses to shake hands with both John Terry and Ashley Cole .

"(Lonely Planet) -- It's your honeymoon, so it has to be special and unique. From the windswept beaches of a car-free island in the Baltic to tasting wine rarely sipped outside Argentina, these hideaways rarely appear on the usual post-wedding itinerary: . 1. Snuggle in a beach basket built for two on Hiddensee Island, Germany. It's unique and you know it: a pristine Baltic island with no motorised transport where horse-and-wagon rides or tooling around on bikes are the only ways around. Amble across dunes and long stretches of sand, or tuck yourselves into a Strandkorb (beach basket), a wicker half-shell chair for two that shelters you from the wind as you watch the waves. 2. Sleep on a lakeside farm in Shelburne, Vermont. This hamlet boasts a 1400-acre working farm with an inn on the banks of Lake Champlain. Beyond, taste award-winning wine at the town's namesake Shelburne Vineyards, known for its crisp northern varietals, and enjoy locavore-friendly (locally-sourced) food at elegant restaurants where farm-to-table cuisine reigns and tastes supreme. 3. Enjoy a private beach on remote Pamalican Island, Philippines. At 5.5 km long, roughly 500 metres at its widest and only one five-star resort on the island, you're guaranteed seclusion. Oh, and dive in to see vibrant colours -- Pamalican is set smack in the centre of a 7 sq km coral reef. 4. Unwind on a gorilla safari in Bwindi Forest National Park, Uganda. On guided walks to observe these gentle giants you'll encounter jagged valleys, dramatic mountain scenery and monkeys. In the evenings, stargaze around campfires and retire in tents built into the jungle canopy while peering into the mist-shrouded rainforest from bed. Lonely Planet: Italy's Perfect Pairs for Honeymooners . 5. Taste wine amid copper-coloured canyons in Cafayate, Argentina. Filled with estancias (sumptuous ranch lodging) and vineyards where you can taste rarely-shipped-abroad varietals like Torrontes, this handsome desert town begs you to wander hand-in-hand, past dusty buildings and candle-lit cafes spilling onto sidewalks. 6. Smooching in Bettmeralp, Switzerland. It starts with a cable-car ride, launching you into a car-free Alpine village. We're not sure what we love more: views of the Aletsch glacier and mountains (including the Matterhorn), strolling between chalets or indulging in fondue. Oh, and Swiss tradition says if you lose your bread in the cheese, you must kiss your dining neighbour -- so let that bread disappear. 7. Embark on a sunset ride in Khan Khentii, Mongolia. Peppered with rolling hills of birch forests and grasslands threaded with rivers, Khan Khentii is a protected wilderness area three times the size of Yellowstone National Park. Go horseback-riding at sunset across the steppe, and try yak cart rafting together before disappearing into plush yurt lodgings. Lonely Planet: Planning the perfect destination wedding . 8. Cruise Alaska's coast on an intimate small ship. Only small vessels can drop anchor at the quiet fjords, tranquil bays and inlets along Alaska's inside passage. From your cabin, peer at bobbing icebergs, imposing glaciers and misty veils of clouds suspended above snow-capped mountain peaks. Or venture out for a walk on a remote beach or in a two-person kayak to float in enchanting coves and glimpse wildlife like otters and seals. 9. Take a vintage train journey in Namibia. From the all-aboard whistle to the smart retro furnishings on the 1950s-esque Desert Express, this train feels like you've stepped on a classic film set. Recline in antique leather armchairs and clink glasses in the Spitzkoppe lounge to the sultry sway of the coach. Later, dine in the Welwitschia restaurant car below sandblasted glass panels featuring local animal footprints while rambling past gold-red dunes and African wildlife. Lonely Planet: 10 Paradises on earth . 10. Enjoy the simple pleasures on Ambergris Caye, Belize. Surrounded by tropical beaches and covered with verdant mangrove swamps in the centre, this island is home to the world's second-largest barrier reef after Australia's. Snorkelling, diving and sunset cruises on catamarans are the norm here, but we're drawn to the balmy nights in basic thatched roof beach huts and napping in two-person hammocks.

"(CNN) -- If your screen looks a little girly on Sunday during the Miami Dolphins-New York Jets game, do not adjust your television. Referees will be using pink penalty flags at MetLife Stadium during the final weekend of Breast Cancer Awareness month. Dante Cano, the fifth-grader from Marlboro, New Jersey, came up with the idea -- and he went straight to the top. In a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Cano wrote, ""My name is Dante Cano. I am 11 years old and I am from Marlboro, New Jersey. I wanted to know if you could use my idea of pink penalty flags in October for breast cancer awareness."" High school football player punished for pink . He signed it, ""Please write back."" Goodell did better than write Dante back -- he implemented the 11-year old's idea and invited Dante's family to the game to present the pink penalty flags to the officials before the game. Goodell said he is looking forward to meeting Dante. ""Sometimes the simplest ideas can be the best,"" Goodell said in a statement. ""I applaud Dante for sending his recommendation.""

"(CNN) -- While Barack Obama's and Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns rage on toward November 6, another campaign has been under way for some time, one that's mostly out of the public's eye. An investigation by The Associated Press last month revealed that as many as five Republican electors expressed uncertainty whether they would actually vote for Mitt Romney if he carried their state. These electors appear to be unhappy with Romney and continue to show support for his primary rival Rep. Ron Paul. In the wake of this news, one of the electors abruptly resigned her position. On another front, a Minnesota elector suggested that he may not vote for the Romney-Ryan ticket if the candidates fail to furnish their birth certificates (in an effort to put pressure on all candidates to furnish their birth certificates). These potentially rogue electors would effectively disenfranchise hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of voters. The 2012 election will probably be very close. Consequently, in the worst of scenarios, a ""faithless"" vote might not only disenfranchise voters but alter the outcome of the race. While unlikely, this begs the question: Why do presidential electors still have independence in our current presidential selection process? After examining those who make up the institution, I find one thing increasingly clear: We need to take the guesswork out of the Electoral College. In 2004, I published a study aimed at shedding light on the mysterious figures who serve as presidential electors. In the hotly contested 2000 election, many electors were subjected to vigilant lobbying campaigns. Some received thousands of e-mails; at least one received a death threat. A group called Citizens for a True Democracy, founded by two college seniors, published the contact information of 172 Republican electors online and asked people to urge them to put ""patriotism before partisanship"" and give their electoral votes to Al Gore. The group noted that it would have lobbied Democratic electors to give their votes to George W. Bush had he, rather than Gore, won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. Remarkably, four of the Republican electors I surveyed expressed unease over Bush's victory and the recounts in Florida. On its face, this would not be cause for great concern. However, the 271 electoral votes amassed by the Bush-Cheney ticket barely pushed them over the 270-vote Electoral College majority needed to win the election. Consequently, just two Republican defections or abstentions would have denied the ticket of a majority of electoral votes and thrown the contest into the House of Representatives. Bush would still probably have been elected, but the Electoral College would have created yet another round of uncertainty. Surveying the 2004 and 2008 presidential electors, I found that the 2000 election was not an isolated event. One-third of electors were contacted to change their votes in 2004, and nearly 80% were lobbied to change their votes in 2008. That year, the bulk of lobbying was conducted by ""birthers"" who saw presidential electors as a last hope to get their voices heard after their legal battles failed. Currently, a majority of states and the District of Columbia have legal requirements or pledges to ensure that electors vote for their party's ticket. While the overwhelming majority of electors never consider changing their votes, a surprisingly large number do. In my survey, nearly 10% of electors in 2004 and 11.5% of electors (including 20% of Republicans) in 2008 gave some consideration to voting contrary to expectations. To put this in perspective, this would be akin to all 55 of California's electors considering defection from their party's ticket. Such a prospect is quite unnerving. Indeed, faithless electors are not fanciful creatures from mythology: Nine of the past 16 presidential elections have witnessed faithless votes (including two of the past three). Although none changed the outcome of an election, each faithless vote effectively disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of voters. Electors are chosen primarily for their party loyalty, not for their judgment regarding candidates. Whatever one thinks of the Electoral College, Americans have come to expect that electors will faithfully translate the popular vote into the electoral vote. Elector independence simply adds another layer of uncertainty to a process that already has a great deal of cynicism attached to it. Attempts to curtail faithless votes reflect a very real concern lawmakers and party officials have about the prospect of faithless voting. Ronald Reagan, for example, sent letters to each of the 538 Republican electors shortly before the 1980 election. If candidates are worried about such mischief, citizens should be concerned as well. Efforts to prevent elector faithlessness, like the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act, would provide greater assurance in the presidential selection process, a process where many citizens already have great concerns. Too often, laws proscribing faithless voting take place in states after the act has been committed. States should move to adopt the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act sooner rather than later. Doing so would remove the needless uncertainty created by potentially faithless electors and restore some confidence in the Electoral College process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert M. Alexander.","Rogue electors can disenfranchise millions of voters, Robert M. Alexander says .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday filed paperwork in court that officially ended the murder case against ""Craigslist killer"" Philip Markoff, who committed suicide in jail last month. The Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said prosecutors had a ""very, very strong case"" against Markoff, but it was short-circuited when Markoff took his own life August 15. ""What he did was abhorrent, it was disgraceful, it was brutal and he would have been held accountable,"" said Conley, who told reporters that the case file would be available to review in a few weeks. Markoff, 24, was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine when arrested in April 2009 in the killing of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds service Craigslist, and Markoff might have met her through the site. Authorities said Markoff killed himself in his jail cell by cutting himself multiple times with a makeshift scalpel crafted from a pen and a piece of metal. In addition, a large, clear plastic bag of a type issued to inmates was fastened around his neck with a piece of gauze. The name of his former fiancee, who called off their wedding after his arrest, was scrawled in what appeared to be blood on the wall of his cell when he was found, Conley told reporters at the time. Conley said the Brisman family was ""robbed of the opportunity"" to seek justice against Markoff.","NEW: DA files paperwork that ends murder case .

"(EW.com) -- ""Katie"" may be daytime's most colorful show. The greenroom is literally painted a soft mint green. Deep blues adorn the high-tech, mechanized set. Audience members are decked out in numerous brightly hued cardigans. And Monday, the show's stage was bathed by sultry red lights in honor of Couric's guest — Erika Leonard, a.k.a. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" author E L James. (""Fifty Shades"" hero Christian Grey does his dirtiest deeds in a chamber known as the Red Room of Pain.) The kinky theme didn't stop with that crimson glow. For one day only, the usually demure ""Katie"" logo was adorned with a pair of handcuffs naughtily looped around the ""k."" And Couric herself drew whoops from the audience when she appeared at the top of the hour in a sleeveless black leather dress and sky-high stilettos — to the tune of Rihanna's ""S&M,"" naturally. ""Relax — this won't hurt at all,"" Couric joked, introducing herself as our ""mistress"" for the day. What would Matt Lauer think?! Given all this, audience members probably expected James to emerge wearing an ""American Horror Story""-style rubber fetish suit — or at least to be as boisterous and open as Anastasia Steele's inner goddess. In actuality, James is a shy, normal-looking lady in her 40s who speaks so softly that I had difficulty hearing her from backstage — not exactly what you'd expect from a woman who has sold 30 million copies of her erotic novels in just six months. And honestly, James still seems pretty flabbergasted by all the attention her work is getting. ""It's ridiculous,"" she said in wonder when asked about the 50 Shades phenomenon. Despite the fact that her books have been credited with single-handedly saving Barnes & Noble from oblivion, James' lifestyle hasn't changed much since her bestselling trilogy was published. Her teenaged sons still tease her, though they're also supportive of (and a little embarrassed by) her success; her only major purchase has been a new Volkswagen. ""I know how to live, ladies!"" she joked after Couric mentioned the car. And yes, she asked whether the backseat was big enough to have sex in before making a down payment. Couric's audience ate it all up, howling with laughter at a video clip from a Fifty Shades-themed exercise class and nodding thoughtfully when a specialist from the Kinsey Institute called the books ""the sex version of the cupcake."" (It made sense in context.) When it came time to pose their own questions, they asked whether James has plans to write something from Christian Grey's perspective (answer: maybe), if she's got any advice for those looking to dip a toe into the world of BDSM (""I would say start with a tie, honestly""), and who she'd pick to star in the upcoming film adaptation of the series' first novel. James was coy about this last query, saying only that she has three unnamed actors in mind for Christian and four in mind for Anastasia. But Katie's audience has a few casting ideas of its own: According to Facebook polls, they'd like to see Gilmore Girls alum Alexis Bledel as the naive college grad and Vampire Diaries hottie Ian Somerhalder as the handsome billionaire who sweeps her off her feet, then chains her to the wall. But though she's staying tight-lipped about the film, James was open and honest when asked how she handles criticism. The Brit has a pretty zen approach to those who badmouth her writing: ""Somebody likes it,"" she said with a shrug. As for those who don't? She tries not to sweat them — ""It's just noise,"" James explained. She advises those who want to replicate her success to embrace that same outlook: ""Write for yourself,"" she told aspiring authors. ""That's it. And write every day."" Before saying goodbye, Couric genially asked James if the interview had been painful — innuendo intended — and James joked that it hadn't been ""painful in the right way."" And thus ended the kinkiest episode of daytime television since the golden age of Jerry Springer. Though she put on a brave face, it seems like taking off her handcuff-inspired bracelet and watching the lights shift from naughty red to regular white might have been a relief for Couric — during a post-show Q&A, the TV vet admitted that she wouldn't let her 16 and 21-year-old daughters read James' bestsellers. ""But I'm a prude, as you guys can tell,"" she quipped before leaving the stage for good. See the full story at EW.com.
