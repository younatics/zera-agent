"A virus that spreads through wifi networks as effectively as a human cold moves through densely populated areas has been revealed. The experimental virus, called Chameleon, was able to spread quickly between homes and businesses. It could avoid detection and identify the points at which WiFi access is least protected by encryption and passwords. The researchers say their virus could spread through cities as effectively as the common cold virus . The chameleon virus can travel between WiFi networks via Access Points (APs) that connect households and businesses to WiFi networks. It was able to avoid detection and identify the points at which WiFi access is least protected by encryption and passwords, using them to hop between networks. Chameleon was able to avoid detection as current virus detection systems look for viruses that are present on the internet or computers, but Chameleon is only ever present in the WiFi network . The University of Liverpool team simulated an attack on Belfast and London in a laboratory setting, and found that Chameleon behaved like an airborne virus, travelling across the WiFi network via Access Points (APs) that connect households and businesses to WiFi networks. The team say major cities are at risk of attacks from similar systems created by hackers. Areas that are more densely populated have more wifi access points in closer proximity to each other, which meant that the virus propagated more quickly, particularly across networks connectable within a 10-50 metre radius. Alan Marshall, Professor of Network Security at the University, said: 'When Chameleon attacked an AP it didn’t affect how it worked, but was able to collect and report the credentials of all other WiFi users who connected to it. 'The virus then sought out other WiFi APs that it could connect to and infect.' Chameleon was able to avoid detection as current virus detection systems look for viruses that are present on the internet or computers, but Chameleon is only ever present in the WiFi network. Whilst many APs are sufficiently encrypted and password protected, the virus simply moved on to find those which weren’t strongly protected including open access WiFi points common in locations such as coffee shops and airports. Although the virus is currently experimental, researchers warn it could be used by hackers to collect and report the passwords of users who connect to infected networks. Professor Marshall continued said: 'WiFi connections are increasingly a target for computer hackers because of well-documented security vulnerabilities, which make it difficult to detect and defend against a virus. 'It was assumed, however, that it wasn’t possible to develop a virus that could attack WiFi networks but we demonstrated that this is possible and that it can spread quickly. 'We are now able to use the data generated from this study to develop a new technique to identify when an attack is likely.'","Liverpool team designed experimental virus to spread through areas with lots of wifi networks .

"The summer palace of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor of India, has been unearthed at a 500-year-old garden opposite the Taj Mahal. Archaeologists suspect the latest discovery is a palace 'baradari' - a pavilion with 12 doors designed to allow free flow of air. The garden where it was found, known as Mehtab Bagh, was thought to a favourite spot for the emperor to gaze up at the Taj Mahal at night. The summer palace of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor of India, has been unearthed at a 500-year-old garden opposite the Taj Mahal. So far, archaeologists have unearthed remains of the wall (pictured) at the garden complex, located on the opposite bank of the Taj Mahal in Agra . Mehtab Bagh- which translates to Moonlight Garden - has been associated with the myth of the black Taj. Some scholars believe Shah Jahan never meant for himself to be buried along with his wife and instead wanted to build another Taj Mahal for his resting place, but this time, in black marble. A European traveller named Jean Baptiste Tavernier who visited Agra in 1665 first mentioned the idea of Black Taj in his writings. The story gained credibility following observation made by archaeologists in 2006, that part of the pool in the moonlit garden reflected a dark reflection of the white mausoleum. Archaeologists have also suggested that the blackened marbles in Mehtab Bagh that lie on the other side of the river are in fact foundations of an abandoned plan for the black Taj. ‘The remains of the baradari-like structure have been found just opposite the Taj Mahal which strengthens our belief that the Mughal emperor must have built this place to enjoy the view of the Taj sitting near the bank of river. ‘The place seems to have sunk beneath the surface either due to floods or because of the presence of hollow space under the structure,’ an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) official told Aditya Dev at the Times of India.

"Leonardo da Vinci can add 'weatherman' to his already dizzying array of talents, according to a new book. Geologist and Renaissance art expert Ann Pizzorusso claims the artist, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist and writer was also the first to see the swirling patterns of water and air at the heart of a hurricane. She came to this conclusion after seeing drawings of biblical floods by Leonardo in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle and outlines them in her book Tweeting da Vinci. Vortex: Geologist and Renaissance art expert Ann Pizzorusso claims Leonardo da Vinci to the first to see the swirling patterns of water and air at the heart of a hurricane, as evidenced by this drawing . Was da Vinci once again hundreds of years ahead of his time? Right, a satellite image of a hurricane . Pizzorusso says the sketches, drawn between 1514 and 1518, reveal the distinctive 'vortex flow patterns' discovered by meteorologists in the 1970s using satellite technology. 'I found something extraordinary,' she told The Sunday Times. 'These patterns are similar to hurricane configurations so familiar to us today. 'Some of them swirl in a clockwise direction and some anti-clockwise. That's very much what happens in the atmosphere. Her theory has been backed by Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society. The inventor came up with designs for tanks and helicopters and in 2008 a Swiss daredevil trusted to his genius by creating a parachute from one of his designs . However, a Renaissance scholar says da Vinci is known to have observed numerous natural phenomena and claims the vortices could easily represent something else. It is not the first time Da Vinci, who was born in April 1452 in Tuscany and died in May 1519 in Amboise, France, was centuries ahead of his time. The inventor came up with designs for tanks and helicopters and in 2008 a Swiss daredevil trusted to his genius by creating a parachute from one of his designs. Olivier Vietti-Teppa, 36, jumped  using a parachute based on sketches made by the Italian Renaissance artist in 1485. He said after the jump in Payerne, near Geneva: 'It worked perfectly. I was unable to steer it, but I just glided gracefully to the ground.' However, he admitted he had been wearing a modern reserve parachute in case da Vinci's design - made out of four triangles of fabric and with a pointed top - had failed to open.","Author claims genius' sketches show he understood structure of hurricanes .

"Caesarean sections may have been performed on women with birthing difficulties since ancient times, but the emergency procedure has just been done on a sloth for the first time. A female sloth who fell out of a tree in Costa Rica underwent the emergency operation after suffering seizures and vets captured the moment her baby was born was on camera. The injured animal was able to snuggle with her baby who is shown swaddled in a blanket and exploring his surroundings, soon after birth. Scroll down for video: Warning graphic content . A mother sloth who fell out of a tree in Costa Rica underwent the operation after suffering seizures and the moment her baby was born was captured on camera. Here, the baby snuggles up to his mother . The pregnant brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) was brought to the Sloth Institute Costa Rica, after a local hotel worker saw her fall out of a tree, BBC Earth reported. After trying to help her get back up and climb to safety, he realised something was wrong and called the Institute for help. The pregnant brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) was brought to the Sloth Institute Costa Rica, after a local hotel worker saw her fall out of a tree. Here, she undergoes an ultrasound examination . Despite medication, the mother was struggling to survive and found it hard to move. After a few days, she began to have contractions and could feel the baby kicking. An ultrasound scan is pictured . Experts quickly saw the was having ‘slow’ seizures and was finding it hard to move her limbs as the result of a knock on the head. ‘It was more like a neurotic tick than a typical seizure seen in human and non-human primates,’ according to a diary entry on the Institute’s website and upon close examination, experts found that while the mother had not fractured her skull, she was heavily pregnant. Despite medication, the mother was struggling to survive and found it hard to move. After a few days, she began to have contractions and could feel the baby kicking. Making no noticeable recovery, the mother was taken to a vetinary practice and underwent X-rays (pictured) which showed that her baby was alive but in a breach position and was on course to be born feet-first . A c-section (pictured) was performed - thought to be the first time the procedure has been used on a sloth. The sloth was anaesthetised and her bladder drained and after 30 minutes, the baby sloth’s head appeared. Here, the baby male sloth is shown shortly after birth . The brown-throated sloth is a species of three-toed sloth found in Costa Rice the forests of South and Central America. It is the most common of the four species of three-toed sloth. Both males and females measure between 17 and 31 inches (42-80cm) long and stand between one to three-and-a-half inches (2.5-9cm) tall. Adults weigh from 5lbs (2.3kg) to 14lbs (6.3kg). Each foot has three fingers ending in long, curved claws up to three inches (8cm) long. The creatures sleep for up to 18 hours a day and are only active for short periods. Most of their time is spent clinging to high branches and they only venture onto the forest floor to go to the toilet around once every week. Adults are solitary, apart from during mating season when females emit loud, shrill cries to attract males. The noise sounds like they are saying 'ay ay'. Gestation lasts for at least seven months and baby sloths are born furry and fully-clawed. Despite this, they cling to their mother's underside for five months or more. ‘I’ve never seen a sloth have contractions, but these “painful moments” where her entire body seemed to be cramping and her arms reached out for anything to squeeze…really seemed like contractions to me!’ Sam Trull, head of the Institute, wrote. Experts at the Institute grew concerned that the birth was not drawing closer, despite the mother’s discomfort and took her to a vet in the town of Herradura. There, the three-toed animal underwent X-rays and an ultrasound to confirm that her baby was alive but in a breach position and was on course to be born feet-first. Another obstacle to a natural birth became clear, because the mother had a full bladder which was blocking her baby’s safe passage and making it unlikely that it might be able to turn around in the womb. Sloths only pass waste once a week and consequently can store a lot - up to one third of their body weight. ‘We determined it was an emergency, and that the only chance we had to save either or both of them was to do a C-section,’ said Ms Trull. The sloth was anaesthetised and her bladder drained and after 30 minutes, the baby sloth’s head appeared. The male infant seemed to be losing body heat fast, but after it was placed against Ms Trull’s chest for skin-to-skin contact, the animal warmed up and was quickly swaddled in a blanket, where he seemed alert and curious about his new surroundings. The male infant (pictured left) seemed to be losing body heat fast, but after it was placed against Ms Trull’s chest for skin-to-skin contact (right) the animal warmed up and was quickly swaddled in a blanet . Having warmed up, the animal was quickly swaddled in a blanket (pictured), where he seemed alert and curious about his new surroundings. He was later re-united with his injured mother . Despite the pioneering sloth surgery, the story has a sad ending. Vets discovered that baby sloth had a heart murmur as well as difficulties breathing and feeding. Sadly, he died a week after being born. And his mother gave up her fight for life a day afterwards, having suffered neurological problems since her fall. Ms Trull said: ‘It was devastating but not entirely surprising.’ She said she is glad the mother and baby got to spend quality time with each other and were seen snuggling up soon after the birth. ‘I'm glad he had a week, and that he had some snuggles with his mum. I was at least able to unite mother and baby before they died, so it might not have been a very long life but at least it was a life,’ she said. Despite appearing healthy at birth (pictured) the little sloth was found to have a heart murmur as well as difficulties breathing and feeding. He died at one week old and his mother died soon afterwards. Ms Trull says that despite the 'devastating' outcome, the operation gave both animals the best chance of survival and she is pleased they got to spend quality time with each other .","Three-toed sloth fell out of a tree and suffered brain injuries .

"Schapelle Corby's siblings will be awarded over $300,000 as part of their defamation court case against the author and publisher of Sins Of The Father. Publishing company Allen and Unwin reached a settlement with the Corby family, Fairfax reports, in which Mercedes Corby will be awarded $175,000 and her brother Michael Corby junior will receive $150,000. The book, which was written by journalist Eamonn Duff and released in 2011, delves into the life of Schapelle and her family, including her father who died of cancer. Schapelle Corby's siblings, including Mercedes Corby (pictured) will be awarded over $300,000 for their defamation case against Allen and Unwin and writer Eamonn Duff . It's defamatory claims included that family members including their deceased father were involved in drug smuggling and that Schapelle's conviction benefited the family financially. Mercedes released a statement after the settlement was reached, in which she said 'This book was riddled with incorrect facts about my family — facts that could have been easily checked but were not.' 'Had my father been alive, this book would never have been published. There is no legal avenue for the family of a dead person who has been defamed to vindicate their loved-one's reputation. 'My father was a good man who worked hard in the mines most of his adult life before succumbing to cancer. The allegations made about him in this book are false and were devastating to his family. The Corby family's took legal action against the book Sins Of The Father which claimed Schapelle's father (pictured) participated in activities involving drugs . The book was also found to have breached copyright laws by using five family photographs of Corby . 'We are fortunate that we could do something about this book — and are happy today that Allen & Unwin and Mr Duff have had to pay for what they said about our family.' Damages were also paid earlier in the year for the use of five family photographs of Schapelle which were ruled a breach of copyright, while four of those were found to have infringed a 'moral right of attribution'. According to Fairfax, the pictures showed Shapelle as a child, with her father, in jail with her mother, with a drug dealer in Bali and at the airport before jetting off to Bali. Although four out of five photographs were given to various photographers and journalists by the Corby's themselves, the family members claimed they did not intend for them to be used for Mr Duff's purpose.

"Aaron Ramsey has launched a staunch defence of under-fire manager Arsene Wenger after hailing ‘the best’ goal of his career. The Wales midfielder helped eased the pressure on the Arsenal boss with a wonder goal — an outrageous left-footed strike from 30 yards — in the comfortable 4-1 win away to Galatasaray in Istanbul on Tuesday night. Wenger has been the target of heavy criticism from a section of supporters following the club’s disappointing start to the season in the Barclays Premier League. Arsene Wenger has endured some tough criticism from Gunners supporters in recent weeks . Arsenal fans displayed a banner calling for Wenger to step down before the recent game against West Brom . And Ramsey has defended his manager from the hurtful jibes from the stands. ‘Every player here wants to work hard for him, we have proven that again against Galatasaray,’ said Ramsey. ‘He has been under some unfair criticism, but we are all out there, are in it together. We wanted to get the result for us and for him. ‘I think whenever we go into a game, he knows our qualities, always believes in us and gives us a great feeling going into games. ‘Every time we go out there we are representing ourselves, our club and our manager.’ Ramsey, after an early-season blip, is now approaching the form that saw him win the club’s player of the year award last term. Ramsey (left) fires a long-range shot towards goal as Arsenal too Galatasaray apart . His super strike in Turkey was testament to that — and Ramsey has warned Arsenal’s rivals that he feels close to his best. ‘I have seen the goal back, and it is definitely the best I have scored,’ he said. ‘As soon as I hit it, I thought it had a chance of going in and thankfully it went into the top corner. ‘My best goal before this one? I like the volley at Norwich last season, probably that one.’ He added: ‘I felt good at the Manchester United game last month, I am getting sharper in every game. I am feeling good and hopefully now I can play my part as the team go on a run.’ Lukas Podolski also scored twice, having been linked with a January move away following a lack of first-team opportunities. The German forward told Arsenal’s website: ‘For me it was important to play 90 minutes and keep going. It is not always easy to come in and do well, so it was good for me to do that.’","Arsene Wenger was heckled by Arsenal fans after the 3-2 loss to Stoke .

The venue was chosen so that Lancaster could play a part despite being in the middle of a crucial international week that culminates in a Test against Australia on Saturday after a disappointing autumn series. Stuart Lancaster attended a think tank this week in the build-up to England's Test match against Australia . There will be some surprise within rugby that Lancaster, who regularly speaks on leadership topics, wanted to participate in such a meeting during England’s run of four November games. The organisers, who put on their P8 summits loosely based on the G8 political meets in the UK and the US, said Lancaster ‘popped in’ when he could during the Wednesday session, between his rugby duties on the squad’s day off. As well as Lancaster, Brailsford and Hodgson, the P8 included UK Sport director of performance Simon Timson and Andy Walshe who heads Red Bull’s high-performance athlete development programme. The William Hill Sports Book of the Year award went once again — as Sports Agenda predicted — to an obscure tome, this time about the rape trial of an Australian Rules footballer, rather than either of the acclaimed front runners, Gareth Thomas’s autobiography and the Bobby Moore biography. The elitist panel, as they have done for most of the last 26 years judging this prestigious award, much prefer to be different rather than populist. The first prize includes a free £2,500 bet which last year’s winning author Jamie Reid safely staked on UKIP winning the Rochester by-election at odds of 1-10. Anna Krien poses after winning the 2014 William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award on Thursday . Northumberland FA’s belated decision to sever all links with 77-year-old vice-president John Cummings after his sexist remarks should lead to the FA revising their scandalous decision to allow referee grandee David Elleray to remain in office following racist comments to a black colleague. Click here to read Charles Sales earlier column detailing Michael Oliver's resignation from the Northumberland FA's referee academy . The county FA made a U-turn on not taking further action against Cummings after he was banned for four months by the FA for telling junior referee Lucy May that a woman’s place was in the kitchen. So the FA should think again about Elleray, who was playing an active role in this week’s rules-governing International Football Association Board meeting in Belfast, after he was only slapped on the wrist for asking a black colleague whether his tan was the result of going down a coal mine. John Cummings told Lucy May (above) that her place was 'in the kitchen' and not within football . Lord Coe has turned to bid spinmeister Mike Lee, who helped London 2012 across the line, in his quest for the IAAF presidency. Lee knows all the machinations of such a campaign with successes including Rio landing the 2016 Olympics and the unlikely appointment of Brian Cookson as chief of cycling’s UCI. Lord Coe has turned his attentions to spinmeister Mike Lee in his quest for the IAAF presidency . BEEFY TIPPED FOR UKIP . UKIP will be targeting Labour leader Ed Miliband’s seat in Doncaster after research published yesterday showed they could win it. This adds more intrigue to a fascinating rumour that UKIP will approach Yorkshire-based right-winger Sir Ian Botham to contest the seat. Sky Sports pundit Botham said curtly he wouldn’t discuss such ‘garbage’ while cricket is mourning Phillip Hughes. Cricket-loving UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who describes Sir Ian as his ultimate hero, said he knew nothing about any such approach, but added: ‘I don’t know everything that goes on in my party but I would be over the moon if it happened.’ Sir Ian Botham said he wouldn't discuss such 'garbage' concerning contesting UKIP seat following the tragic death of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes . The three current FIFA ExCo members, as Sports Agenda revealed, still being investigated by American lawyer Michael Garcia over corruption relating to World Cup bids are Spain’s Angel Maria Villar Llona, Belgium’s Michel D’Hooghe and Thailand’s Worawi Makudi. Serial corruption allegations surround Makudi, Villa Llona headed Spain’s alleged vote collusion with Qatar and D’Hooghe’s involvement suggests Belgium’s bid was not as squeaky-clean as reported.

"It was a run that ended on a high with the Club World Cup won in Marrakech against San Lorenzo but in the end Real Madrid stopped just short of setting a new world record for consecutive wins. After 22 straight victories they fell just short of Coritiba – the Brazilian side who currently hold the Guinness world record for 24 wins – and the Ajax team that strung together 26 straight wins in the 1971-72 season (losing only one friendly match on the run). They were given a guard of honour on to the pitch at the start of the Valencia game. The gesture was for their Club World Cup success but it could easily have been for the longest winning streak in Spanish football history. Cristiano Ronaldo was helpless as Real Madrid's 22-match winning run came to an end at Valencia . Real were given a guard of honour before the game for winning the FIFA Club World Cup last month .

When they beat Ludogorets 4-0 in their last Champions League group game they set a new Spanish record of 19 wins, beating the 18-game run of Frank Rijkaard’s Barcelona side in the 2005-06 season. Ajax and Coritiba might have remained a step too far but Carlo Ancelotti and his coaching staff may breathe a sigh of relief that the loss has come now and not as they build up steam in their bid to win the treble this season. Valencia in Mestalla was always going to be a tough first game back after the winter break and finally the tank ran dry. Even if they had beaten Nuno’s Valencia team it still would have been tough to keep winning with a two-legged tie against Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey still standing between them and the record. Two wins over an Atletico side boosted by the return of Fernando Torres, and wins over Espanyol and Getafe would have seen them set a new record but it has still been an incredible journey and one that started after consecutive defeats to Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid earlier in the season.

Back then there were doubts over whether the new signings were fitting in, and whether the side could cope with the loss of Angel Di Maria and Xabi Alonso. 'I think it was a combination of some change in personnel and a difficult pre-season coming off the back of a World Cup on an American tour where we only had 10 senior players,' reflected Carlo Ancelotti’s assistant coach Paul Clement. The first win of the run came on September 16 at home in the Champions League when Basle were on the wrong end of a 5-1 hammering. Madrid then put eight past Deportivo and five more past Elche. Suddenly they were averaging six goals a game and it wasn’t all easy home wins against intimidated opposition either. They went to Villarreal and won 2-0 and they then went to Bulgaria and saw off Ludogorets 2-1. Then came the reat test – Liverpool, Barcelona and Liverpool again in the space of just two weeks. They made it look easy. James Rodriguez (left) celebrates with Isco and his team-mates during Real's win over Barcelona . The winning run has been inspired by Real coach Carlo Ancelotti .

'It’s like another player for them. But we did really well after a difficult first 20 minutes. We got the goal and calmed the crowd.' Real ran out 3-0 winners and former Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo was even applauded off by the Kop when substituted. Barcelona turned up the Santiago Bernabeu in the next game and were still yet to concede a goal. They scored first with debutant Luis Suarez setting up Neymar. But Real were too strong and ran out 3-1 winners. After wins over Cornella and Granada, Liverpool visited the Bernabeu with a drastically changed team from the first leg but Real still won 1-0. With three mighty scalps under their belts the Madrid steamroller went on flattening the opposition until the end of 2014. They scored 81 goals on the 22-match run with Cristiano Ronaldo netting 28 of those – a stunning tally sufficient to win league top scorer in most seasons.

The other two-thirds of the BBC front three – Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema – also made it into double figures. And only four times on the run did they not have the majority of possession. ‘Will you be affected by the defeat?’ Ancelotti was asked after the 2-1 defeat to Valencia. ‘After winning 22 straight games, I don’t think so,’ he replied. Madrid fans were also buoyed by Barca’s defeat to Real Sociedad coming on the same day. Front pages in the capital that reflected on the end of the run also ran with ‘Luis Enrique shoots himself in the foot’ headlines. The winning streak has been worthy of Spanish and European champions – now Real Madrid have to go on and bag both those trophies to ensure that after such a wonder mid-season procession of victories they also get a victory parade at the end of the campaign.

"Picture the scenario. Arsenal lose in Istanbul on Tuesday night - only to discover Anderlecht have beaten Borussia Dortmund. Would Arsene Wenger regret only bringing 11 first-teamers to Turkey with him then? That, of course, is the worst case scenario facing the Gunners manager as he prepares his side for their final Champions League group clash against Galatasaray. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Arsene Wenger speak to the press after arriving in Istanbul on Monday . Wenger gives out instructions to his players during a training session at London Colney on Monday morning . There is logic behind the Frenchman's decision - but you wonder if the decision will come back to haunt him. It's true to say finishing top of Group D looks a far-fetched dream, but it looks a dream that Wenger has totally given up on. Which is strange given Wenger, a man who know his stats, understands the perils of finishing second in a Champions League group. Over the last 10 years under 29 per cent of teams that finished in the runners-up spot in their respective pool went on to progress to the next round of the knockout phase. That stat will sound awfully familiar to Wenger and his side. Having finished second in their group last season, they crashed out in the first knockout round against Bayern Munich. Twelve months earlier, they fell at the same hurdle, again to the German giants. Arsenal manager Wenger answers questions at a pre-match press conference in Istanbul on Monday . History repeated itself in 2011 when - having finished second in a group that included Shakhtar Donetsk, Braga and Partizan Belgrade - they lost to Barcelona in the last 16. Wenger, with that in mind, will be keeping his fingers crossed his side avoid one of Europe's superpowers in the next round of the tournament. The Frenchman has gone with the odds. To a point, it's understandable. But imagine how he'd feel if the unthinkable happens and Dortmund do suffer a shock defeat against Anderlecht. Arsenal players as they were knocked out of the Champions League last 16 by Bayern Munich last season . More importantly, imagine how the supporters will feel. Wenger will have a bench full of unproven youngsters to turn to should it emerge finishing top is on. 'Being top would be nice,' admitted Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. 'But is is not fully in our hands. We are here to win the game and that is what we will be trying to do. 'First of all, they (the youngsters who have travelled) are all boys who play for Arsenal Football Club, which warrants definite respect straight away. They all have quality. Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) runs as Arsenal hold a training session at London Colney on Monday morning . Aaron Ramsey (left) and Per Mertesacker (right) sit in a buggy steered by Arsenal physio Colin Lewin . 'For all young players, you have to start somewhere, and you have to be challenged at some point, the young lads who are in the squad if they have the chance that is their chance to prove their point and prove they are capable, . 'From what I have seen of them, they all have good quality, they are all good lads, up for it and prove to boss that they are good players. 'The boys that have been here before, the more experienced players in the team, it is their responsibility to help the young ones get through the game and cope with it. 'There will definitely be nerves, but the lads that have played for a long time still get nervous, that is normal for them to feel nervous. 'They have just got to go out there if they do play and do what they do week in week out that has got them to this position.' The vibes towards Wenger from a section of the club's supporters aren't great at the moment - the uncomfortable scenes at Stoke-on-Trent train station on Saturday, when the Frenchman was abused and heckled by his own fans, are testament to that. Wenger is heckled as he catches a train at Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday after the Premier League defeat . Arsenal players show their frustrations after conceding a third goal to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium . Should the unthinkable happen on Tuesday night then it could turn nasty again. Wenger knows the consequences should things turn out for the worse. He'll be labelled a fool if Anderlecht defeat Borussia Dortmund only for Arsenal not to keep their end of the bargain. However, what would Wenger be labelled as if Anderlecht didn't win and Santi Cazorla, Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs or Alexis Sanchez - the four players who aren't carrying injuries but were told to stay in London - were to pick up an injury? Foolish, right? Particularly when your chances of finishing top of the group were minor. Lukas Podolski posted this picture on Instagram of he and Mertesacker on the flight to Istanbul on Monday . Danny Welbeck (centre) and Kieran Gibbs (right) take part in training on Monday but did not travel to Turkey . Wenger, in that sense, is between a rock and a hard place. Does he go for broke - or risk adding to his already lengthy injury list with the busy festive period upon us? In reality, the team Wenger will play on Tuesday (Szczesny; Debuchy, Mertesacker, Chambers, Bellerin; Flamini, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey; Campbell, Podolski; Sanogo) is more than capable of winning at Galatasaray. Their true crime was letting that three-goal lead slip against Anderlecht. So let's reserve judgement on Wenger's latest call until after Tuesday's clash.

"All proceeds from the fourth one-day international between Pakistan and New Zealand in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday will be donated to those affected by the the Peshawar school massacre, the Pakistan Cricket Board has announced. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for opening fire on the Army Public School in the city on Tuesday, which resulted in the death of at least 130 people, most of them students, and also left scores injured. 'We tried our best to postpone the fourth ODI but were constrained by the broadcasters commitment as well as for cricketing reasons advised by New Zealand management,' said a PCB spokesman. Pakistan players line up for two-minute's silence prior to the fourth ODI against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi . Pakistan announced that all proceeds from the fourth ODI will go to those affected by the events in Peshawar . Pakistan have been playing their 'home' matches in the middle east since the Lahore terrorist attacks of 2009 forced them from their home country. 'We are playing outside Pakistan only because of the threat of terrorism at home,' the spokesman added. 'If we allow terrorists to disrupt our matches abroad, then all will be lost. So we have decided to go ahead with the match and our players will wear black armbands in grief and observe a minute's silence and flags will be lowered. 'The PCB will donate proceeds of the match to the families of the martyred and towards rebuilding the school.'

Pakistan A will now face Kenya on Friday. 'It's sad what's happened in Peshawar,' Pakistan's stand-in skipper Shahid Afridi told the PCB website before the match against New Zealand got under way. 'Our prayers are with the families who have lost their kids. I hope the situation will get better in Pakistan and we live in a secure atmosphere. 'Obviously Pakistan is our country and if any thing happens there it saddens us. 'Whether we are in Pakistan or away, it affects us. Ever since we heard this news we were saying that it should not have happened. Pakistan was left in mouring after a school in Peshawar was attacked by gunmen on Tuesday . The attack in Peshawar killed at least 130 people including teachers and students . 'We hope the situation gets better but we hope that all those who have the responsibility will improve the situation.' Pakistan team manager Moin Khan added: 'It is shocking. We are deeply disturbed by the series of events in Peshawar and at the loss of innocent kids' lives.

"West Ham are preparing for up to a month without talisman Alex Song after Cameroon called him up for the Africa Cup of Nations. The midfielder was not included in his country’s provisional squad for the tournament, which was announced last month, but has been brought in to replace the injured Stephane Mbia. Song had fallen out of favour with the national team following his sending-off in the World Cup against Croatia and has not played for manager Volker Finke since. But the 27-year-old has been one of the top midfielders in the Premier League this season and Finke has brought him back ahead of Wednesday’s deadline for finalised squads. West Ham midfielder Alex Song, shielding Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, has been in fine form this season . Here are the West Ham matches that Alex Song will miss while at the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon . Jan 10 - Swansea (A) Premier League . Jan 18 - Hull (H)  Premier League . Jan 24/25 - Possible FA Cup 4th round . If Cameroon reach the latter stages, Song will potentially miss: . Jan 31 - Liverpool (A) Premier league . Feb 8 - Man United (H) Premier League . This has forced West Ham manager Sam Allardyce to plan for life without Song for the duration of the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, which ends on February 8. It will come as a huge blow to the east London club as they chase a place in Europe. They are currently seventh in the table, four points behind fourth-placed Southampton. West Ham, who face Everton in the FA Cup third round tonight, are also losing Cheikhou Kouyate, who plays for Senegal, and he could be joined by top scorer Diafra Sakho if he recovers from a back problem. Allardyce said: ‘We have a squad that’s available to play Everton less our Africa Cup of Nation players Song and Kouyate, and Sakho, who’s got a back injury.’ Song has been the driving force for West Ham since his loan move from Barcelona in the summer, but the club’s form in the first half of the season, which put them as high as third, is beginning to slide. Song will miss tonight’s game at Everton and Premier League matches against Swansea, Hull and Liverpool. If Cameroon make it to the final he would also miss the clash with Manchester United and be doubtful for a trip to Southampton on February 11. Song, in action against West Brom, will leave to play in the Africa Cup of Nations for Cameroon . Cheikhou Kouyate is off to the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and will miss West Ham's January games . Allardyce is adamant that he will not lose Winston Reid for a minimal transfer fee this month — but conceded that the defender is set to leave in the summer. Reid’s contract expires at the end of the season, meaning he is now free to sign terms with clubs outside of England ahead of a move in July. Unless English clubs agree a transfer fee with West Ham they are forbidden by FIFA regulations to speak to the player, but Allardyce is convinced some are making moves — via third parties — to secure his services. Allardyce claimed: ‘If he’s not going to sign a contract then realistically I find it highly unlikely if it’s not already verbally done. Who knows? Only Winston and his agent can decide in the end. But it’s difficult to think he’s going to stay. ‘If you can prove that clubs have broken the rules then they’re in serious trouble aren’t they? But you can’t prove it. You just hear rumours of this, that and the other. Hammers top-scorer Diafra Sakho ,who is suffering from a back problem, will also be absent . The midfielder, on loan from Barcelona, has been instrumental for the Hammers so far this campaign . ‘It might have nothing to do with the two clubs directly, it could be between two agents. So how can you relate that to the clubs? You can’t, so it can all get done that way.’ West Ham opened talks with Reid over a new deal 12 months ago, during which time Allardyce says they have made ‘a million offers’. But he believes the club can make more money by keeping Reid until the end of the season than selling him now. Allardyce said: ‘You have to balance it out, with £1.8m prizemoney per place, and look at the overall income you can get in, not just that you’re going to lose them for nothing in the summer.’","Alex Song, on loan from Barcelona, has been in fine form this season .

"Captain Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers put on a record undefeated 283 for the fourth wicket as South Africa moved into a commanding position on day one of the first Test against West Indies at Centurion. De Villiers finished the day 141 not out with Amla on 133 at the other end, and the veteran duo will return on day two with the Proteas on 340 for three. Three consecutive wicket maidens had the home side rocking in the morning session but the Windies had no answer to the blistering strokeplay that was to follow, with pick of the bowlers Kemar Roach leaving the field injured after tea. Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers batted South Africa into a commanding position on day one in Centurion . De Villiers ended the day unbeaten on 141 after his stand with the captain Amla . The start was slightly delayed by a wet outfield but when play got under way South Africa, who had been put in, took to the front foot with Alviro Petersen sending the first two balls to the boundary as he and Dean Elgar brought up the 50 in just 60 balls. That solid start was soon taken apart, however, as the hosts lost three wickets in 15 balls for no run. Petersen went for 27 as Roach found the edge and the ball flew nicely to Devon Smith at first slip, with Elgar following for 28, chasing one from Sheldon Cottrell which found Marlon Samuels at gully. De Villiers came in at No 5 with South Africa struggling on 57 for three at SuperSport Park . De Villiers and Amla put on a record 283 runs . Faf du Plessis then fell for an eight-ball duck as Roach, who was enjoying a scintillating spell, found the edge again and Denesh Ramdin gobbled up the catch behind the stumps to leave South Africa 57 for three. Amla and De Villiers saw the home side to lunch but the former had a remarkable let-off four balls after the interval as Roach kissed his off stump but the bails stayed in place. The 50 partnership came up off 77 balls as the experienced duo steadied the ship and began to find the boundary with more regularity. Anything short or wide was getting the treatment but De Villiers was fortunate when he brought up his half-century and the 100 partnership off the same delivery, a miscued pull that flew over Ramdin's head and to the rope. De Villiers then clobbered the first six of the day back over the head of Sulieman Benn before Amla reached 50 for the 50th time in his Test career. Amla had moved on to turn those 50s into 100s on 22 occasions and found the boundary twice in the same over, the second effort a beautiful cover drive. South Africa were 225 for three at tea and De Villiers reached his 20th Test hundred off just 138 balls, with the 200 partnership off 294 deliveries coming not long after. West Indies picked up three quick wickets to leave South Africa reeling on 57 for three . Amla was not to be outdone by his team-mate and notched his 23rd Test century off 161 balls as the Proteas were rampant and there was a scare for West Indies as Roach appeared to be struggling with injury. Roach did not return and while the pace of scoring slowed for the remainder of the session, Amla and De Villiers guided the Proteas to the close with relative ease.","Hashim Amla and AD de Villers both scored centuries at Centurion .

"England were defeated 5-2 by Sri Lanka in the seven-match one-day series and, in truth, very few players have done their World Cup chances much good. Joe Root was the star for the tourists but that was not much of a contest, so bad were many of his team-mates. With the squad for the World Cup being announced on Saturday, Sportsmail assess the England players who appeared in Sri Lanka (highest rated top). Joe Root, on his way to 80 in Colombo, was England's best player during their tour of Sri Lanka . 8 Joe Root (Games 7; batting average 73.40; 1 wicket at 110) England’s best Test batsman in the summer, and their best one-day batsman here. Match-winning century in Pallekele was a masterpiece of timing and good sense. 7 James Taylor (Games 4; average 42.50) Shone twice, using his feet superbly to the spinners, and running like a hare. But it took England until the fourth game to pick him, and he faded. 7 Moeen Ali (Games 7; average 33.71; 5 wickets at 63.80) No one struck the ball more sweetly. There were failures, especially against Tillakeratne Dilshan’s off-breaks, but his 12 sixes were nine more than anyone else, and his strike-rate was 123. Useful off-spin too. James Taylor shone in two matches, while Moeen Ali hit more sixes than any other England batsman . 7 James Tredwell (Games 5; average 17.00; 4 wickets at 54.75) England’s tightest bowler was unlucky to miss out on a turning Colombo pitch for the fourth match. But pitches at the World Cup won’t suit him. 6 Ravi Bopara (Games 6; average 30.83; 1 wicket at 82.00) Began with two fifties and was promoted to No 5, as he wanted. But he reverted to his frustrating ways. Should have bowled more than 15 overs. 6 Chris Jordan (Games 5; average 1.66; 10 wickets at 26.00) His accuracy and rhythm showed odd signs of improvement, and Cook wants him at the World Cup. His slip-catching and potential with the bat could count in his favour. 6 Chris Woakes (Games 7; average 20.60; 14 wickets at 25.28) Confirmed his extra bite with the ball, and collected six-for in the win at Pallekele. Expensive at times, but may have overtaken Finn.

His strike-rate was a relic-like 67. Alastair Cook shows the strain after another ordinary performance with the bat in defeat . 3 Alex Hales (Games 3; average 11.33) Given only three chances, but took none of them. A frustrated figure for much of the tour. 3 Harry Gurney (Games 3; average 8.00; 1 wicket at 158.00) One wicket for 158 in three games, and shaky in the field. Will be lucky to make World Cup squad. 3 Eoin Morgan (Games 7; average 12.85) Produced only one innings of substance – when he was standing in as captain for the banned Cook in the fourth game. Averaged less than five otherwise. Missing his usual spark. 2 Ben Stokes (Games 3; average 11.00; 0 wickets) Utterly devoid of confidence, with both bat and ball. The Ashes seem a long time ago. Ben Stokes' confidence with both bat and ball has gone through the floor .","Joe Root was England's best batsman throughout the one-day series .
James Taylor briefly shone and Moeen Ali was the best six hitter .

"Indian opener Murali Vijay put Australia to the sword in their Brisbane fortress with a brilliant 144 to help drive the tourists to 311 for four at the close of play on the opening day of the second Test on Wednesday. The 30-year-old shared an opening partnership of 56 with Shikhar Dhawan, stalled a little in the sweltering Gabba heat after lunch and then opened up after reaching his fifth Test century in the final session. His innings came to an end after five-and-a-half hours when he stepped down the pitch in search of a 23rd boundary and was caught behind off Nathan Lyon, Australia's off-spinning hero from their 48-run victory in the first Test.

Vijay (pictured sweeping Nathan Lyon during the second Test) reached his fifth century for India . Australia's players, including Brad Haddin (second right), have ice lollies in an attempt to keep cool . 'It was mentally challenging but when you are playing for your country you've got to do your stuff to the best of your ability,' Vijay said. 'You can only go close to perfection, I think I did pretty well today.' Ajinkya Rahane, who shared a 124-run partnership with Vijay, will resume on 75 not out on day two along with Rohit Sharma (26) as India look to inflict a first defeat on Australia at the Gabba since 1988. It was a tough first day as stand-in Australia skipper for Steve Smith, who lost Mitchell Marsh to a hamstring problem after the all-rounder had claimed his first Test victim in Dhawan with the only wicket to fall before lunch. Debutant paceman Josh Hazlewood was also forced to leave the field midway through his 16th over, having taken his first two Test wickets after lunch. A miserable day for the Marsh family was compounded when Mitchell's brother Shaun, recalled to replace injured captain Michael Clarke, dropped Vijay on 36 and again on 102.

Vijay had illustrated his rich vein of form with knocks of 53 and 99 in the first test in Adelaide and fully vindicated returning skipper captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to bat first after winning the toss. Grabbing his third half century of the series with a drive through the covers for four in the first over after lunch, he was then forced to weather a period of pressure as Hazlewood removed Cheteshwar Pujara (18) and Virat Kohli (19). Vijay kept his cool through a second session in which the tourists were only able to add 62 runs to their lunch score of 89-1 but hit his stride again when the bowlers tired in the afternoon sun. Successive fours off Shane Watson took him to his century but he initially looked unaware of having reached the milestone before whipping off his helmet and raising his bat to the visitors' dressing room. The temperature was so hot that an Australian reporter fried an egg on the outfield. Ajinkya Rahane, who shared a 124-run partnership with Vijay, will resume on 75 not out on day two .

"One of the most tumultuous years in English cricket history ended with another batting collapse and an admission from Alastair Cook that he could have ‘no complaints’ if the selectors sack him as one-day captain. England have lost yet another 50-over series – and they are losing their credibility. The sight of Cook standing his ground as he waited for the third umpire to confirm that Mahela Jayawardene had caught him cleanly at slip felt like a fitting coda to an often hapless tour. It was the desperate act of a captain ill-suited to a form of the game in which England – whose 89-run defeat here condemned them to a 5-2 loss – are in danger of being cast adrift. England's hapless players watch the presentations after the 87-run defeat by Sri Lanka in Colombo . Alastair Cook endured an awful tour with the bat and as captain (he only led England to one win in the series) Kumar Sangakkara waves as he walks off after his last ever one-day international on Sri Lankan soil . Sri Lanka's captain Angelo Mathews holds the series trophy after his side easily beat England . On Saturday, barring a late change of heart, the selectors will name Cook as their leader at next year’s World Cup. And if that is confirmed, the ECB will stand accused of sleep-walking their way to disaster. Cook insisted he retained his appetite for the job, even if he has not been able to produce the runs or the results. ‘We’ll find out in a couple of days’ time whether I will be doing it,’ he said. ‘I think we can surprise people at the World Cup, but we’re going to have to play better than we have here. ‘No one’s got any divine right to play for England at all, and my performances this year in the one-day game haven’t been good enough. I can’t have any complaints if the decision went against me. ‘It’s tough when you lose games of cricket and don’t score runs. But I’m still hungry to do it. Whether the selectors still think I’m the right man, we’ll wait and see.’ The details of this fifth and final defeat of the series do not make happy reading. Sri Lanka racked up 302 for six, thanks to 101 from Tillakaratne Dilshan and a 26-ball 54 from Thisara Perera. Then, with the exception of the excellent Joe Root, England made a predictable meal of their chase. Moeen Ali and Alex Hales fell early to aggressive shots, but Cook’s 32 in 49 deliveries made for painful watching. Almost lbw first ball, he was dropped at slip on one, and nearly bowled off an inside edge five runs later. A slog-sweep for six off Dilruwan Perera was a punchy retort, but Cook then got away with an edge off seamer Suranga Lakmal that flew between keeper and slip. Soon, another edge off Lakmal was snaffled by Jayawardene. Cook didn’t want to go. Of course he didn’t. But as he lingered, awaiting the inevitable judgement of Bruce Oxenford, he looked like the loneliest man in Colombo. Mahela Jayawardene plays a classic cover drive on his way to 28 from 31 deliveries . The veteran batsman gestures to the crowd after being clapped off during his final international in Sri Lanka . Kumar Sangakkara gets on the front foot and whacks one through the legside . Sri Lanka opener Tillekeratne Dilshan gets down on one knee to play his trademark 'Dilscoop' shot . The hosts' captain Angelo Mathews plays a reverse sweep as Sri Lanka head for a big score . Dilshan plays the ball through the offside (left) and salutes his century by pointing to the sky . Dilshan jumps for joy after reaching three figures in Colombo . Dinesh Chandimal  hits a six as Sri Lanka pile on the runs in the final 10 overs of their innings . Thisara Perera was also part of the hosts' onslaught at the end, bludgeoning his way to 50 . For all managing director Paul Downton’s talk of the progress England have made this year from the lowest of bases – and in the case of a few players he has a point – they have lost eight of the 11 bilateral series played either partially or completely in 2014. And that doesn’t include the World Twenty20, where they were humiliated by the Netherlands. Only the 3-1 Test win over India can be looked back on with much pride. The rest has been middling to poor – and worse. This performance belonged in the last category. England will reason that they are closer to knowing their World Cup team than they were when they arrived in Sri Lanka: Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Root and Chris Woakes have all enhanced their reputations. But Eoin Morgan, out for four as he pre-meditated a sweep, is sinking fast, Jos Buttler looks tired, and Steven Finn had a quiet tour. Alex Hales has been messed around by the selectors. Moeen Ali is bowled by Dilshan from the first ball he faced in a woeful start by England . Alastair Cook watches as the ball goes through the covers as he tries to get England back on track . England captain Cook wears an anguished expression after being dismissed for 32 . Suranga Lakmal celebrates dismissing James Taylor during another dismal innings for England . Sangakkara successfully appeals for the wicket of Eoin Morgan, who was given out lbw after a review . Jos Buttler skies one on the offside but is caught on the cover boundary . Root top-scored for England, again doing well with the bat in a losing cause . Chris Woakes of England is bowled comprehensively by Dilruwan Perera as his stumps go flying . For Ian Bell and Harry Gurney it may be time to say goodbye, though Ben Stokes is young and talented enough to qualify for an au revoir. This, though, was no way to convince an increasingly sceptical English cricketing public that their team will have a prayer at the World Cup. Sri Lanka, energised by a crowd who were cheering on the final one-day appearances on home soil of Jayawardene and his fellow legend Kumar Sangakkara, outplayed England in every department. The pair even combined to take the last wicket: sentimentally thrown the ball by captain Angelo Mathews, Jayawardene had James Tredwell stumped by his old buddy. These sides will meet again during the World Cup at Wellington, where Sri Lanka will hope to capitalise on an 8-4 winning record against England in one-dayers this year. You wouldn’t bet against them. As Cook said: ‘It’s been a hell of a year.’","England lose one-day international series 5-2 after falling in Colombo .
Tillekeratne Dilshan scored a hundred as Sri Lanka posted 302 for six .

"Photographer George Tate's work displays his uncanny ability to capture the giddiness and hope of a place and time. His mesmerizing depictions of mid-century Southern California and its beautiful, tanned denizens show a world, which he called 'a modern-day Babylon' where fitness, positivity, and laid back attitudes ruled. Tate's subjects couldn't be more vibrant and carefree as they frolic in the sun and pump iron at Muscle Beach. A beauty pageant's contestants stand by, beaming as they vie for a crown. Acrobats send each other flying into the fresh beach air. All is clearly well in the Golden State. But as preoccupied as Texas transplant Tate was with his adopted state's people and their characteristic zest for life, he was more interested in experiencing the good life along with them then he was showing the world what Southern California had to offer. Only now, after remaining largely unseen for some 50 years, are Tate's remarkable glimpses into a uniquely jubilant world gaining notice in the art and history worlds. The late Tate's son Greg is now helping show the world his dad's impressive work. Tate's photographs are currently housed at the Santa Monica History Museum and Santa Monica, California's Craig Krull Gallery will have a display dedicated to the photographer's handiwork through August 31.

"An American Revolutionary War-era cannon on decorative display in Manhattan's Central Park has been discovered to be loaded with a cannon ball - and even primed with gunpowder - during a routine cleaning. Park workers made the discovery Friday afternoon while refurbishing one of two cannons stored at Central Park's Ramble Shed, near the park's 79th Street entrance. Fire!: The cannon found to still have a cannon ball and gun powder inside it was donated to the park around the time of the Civil War . Live ammo: The loaded artillery piece hasn't been on display since 1996, but was publicly accessible in Central Park for more than 100 years before that time . Origins: The Central Park cannon was once used on the British naval ship, HMS Hussar, circa 1763. The ship was used to carry dispatches and military payroll during the American Revolution . The two guns were reportedly donated at the time of the Civil War - but had not been on public display since 1996. Still, the loaded cannon was reportedly accessible to the public for more than a 100 years before that time. 'It seems like some people are pretty incompetent not to notice after all these years,' an unidentified man told CBS New York. Cops were quickly summoned to the scene, and removed the gun powder so as to render the cannon incapable of firing. Ready to fire: An official gathers the actual gunpowder that still amazingly remained in the cannon after more than 200 years . Out of retirement: The cannon has been housed at the park's Ramble Shed, near its 79th St. entrance, but should soon make a reappearance on public display . 'We silenced British cannon fire in 1776 and we don't want to hear it again in Central Park,' NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said. The cannon originally came from a British Royal Navy Ship, the 28-gun HMS Hussar, which reportedly carried dispatches and military payroll during the American Revolution. The ship eventually foundered off the coast of Long Island, and has been the subject of numerous salvage efforts. The cannon had been long ago sealed with concrete, but when parks officials removed the concrete to conduct the cleaning, they made the dangerous discovery.","Workers made the astounding discovery while refurbishing the cannon for public display .

"The moment a captive polar bear gave birth to two tiny cubs was captured on camera in what is thought to be the first such footage ever taken. Seven-year-old polar bear Giovanna gave birth to her twins two days ago in the birthing den at the Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany. They are the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in Europe this year and, incredibly, their mother positioned herself in the direct view of CCTV cameras set up to record the moment. Mother's love: Seven-year-old polar bear mother . Giovanna snuggles up with her twin cubs after they were born at . Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany, on Monday, the first time such a . birth has been filmed in colour . Rare moment: The tiny twins are the only polar . bear cubs to be born in captivity in Europe this year and, incredibly, . their mother positioned herself in the direct view of CCTV cameras set . up to record the moment . By yesterday both twins were said to be developing well, with their mother taking excellent care of them. 'They are both regularly drinking her milk. In between they are tumbling around on mum,' the zoo said in a statement. Giovanna gave birth to the first of the pair at 8.39am on Monday following a short labour. Minutes earlier she had been biting her front paw to counteract the pain of contractions, before the eight-inch-long cub slid out. The infant cub was hairless, smeared in blood, blind and deaf. Less than a quarter of an hour later, following another contraction that spurred Giovanna to shake and push her back legs forcefully against the wall, a thin arm, small head and then another arm of another cub came into view. However, Giovanna was so busy with her first born that she didn't immediately realise that she'd even given birth to a second baby for another 20 minutes. After finally noticing the tiny second cub she turned her head and picks it up carefully in her mouth before laying it on her leg next to its older sibling to suckle. Colour footage from surveillance cameras captured both births at close range - the first time anywhere in the world that a polar bear birth has been filmed in colour. The zoo’s director, Dr. Andreas Knieriem, said: 'It is as if we were there live watching the labour and birth of a polar bear and, as if that weren’t enough, Giovanna showed us not one, but two very different births!' Hellabrunn Zoo is now bracing itself for a surge in visitors. When Knut the polar bear was born in Berlin Zoo at the end of 2006 the capital's animal park was flooded by visitors keen to catch a glimpse of the cub. In the meantime, Giovanna has her work cut out merely keeping her youngsters alive. Polar bears are at greater risk of dying in the first week of their lives than any other mammal, thelocal.de reported. But Hellabrun's curator, Beatrix Köhler, said she was impressed with the polar bear mother's behaviour so far. 'Our female polar bear, Giovanna, is caring for her twins very capably as if she were an experienced mother,' said Ms Köhler. 'But at seven years old she is actually a first-time mum!' Out it comes: Giovanna gave birth to the first of the pair at 8.39am on Monday following a short labour. Minutes earlier she had been biting her front paw to counteract the pain of contractions . Giovanna licks clean her tiny baby: The infant cub was hairless, smeared in blood, blind and deaf . Spectacle: Journalists gathered at the zoo to watch as the cubs were born live on CCTV on Monday morning . Just like in the wild, Giovanna must take care of her young on her own during their risky early period. Even their father, 14-year-old Yogi, is being kept in a separate enclosure until they are fit and healthy. Christine Strobl, Munich's mayor and a member of the zoo’s board of directors, said she was also delighted. 'The birth of polar bear cubs is definitely a highlight for any zoo and I am overjoyed that we are able to welcome two cubs at once,' she said.","Twins are the only polar bear cubs to be born in a European zoo this year .

"A female driver in Oklahoma was allowed to pose for her driver's license wearing a spaghetti strainer on her head because it falls under the state's rules for religious headwear. Shawna Hammond claims she needs to wear the colander as it is part of her faith as a Pastafarian in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Pastafarianism, which was founded by an atheist in 2005 to protest against the teaching of creationism in school and to poke fun at religion, uses the spaghetti strainer as its symbol. A female driver in Oklahoma was allowed to pose for her driver's license wearing a spaghetti strainer on her head because it falls under the state's rules for religious headwear . Shawna Hammond wore the unusual headgear because it is deemed a suitable accessory for her 'Pastafarian' religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster . Ms Hammond explained that she was allowed to take the photo because she obeyed the state's laws that requires people remove their glasses and wear a religious headpiece that does not cover their face, create shadows, or display text or logos. 'I asked if I could wear my religious headwear and he said, yes — it just couldn't have any logos, or any type of writing. I told him it didn't, and I went out to my car and got my colander. 'It doesn't cover my face. I mean, you can still see my face. We have to take off our glasses, so I took off my glasses,' Ms Hammond told Fox6 Now. In January Christopher Schaeffer, a council member in Pomfret, New York wore a colander on his head as he was sworn into office . Ms Hammond is an Atheist and believes no one should be forced into certain beliefs. 'For me the colander represents freedom, our freedom of religion, and to whatever religion that we prefer, or even lack of religion,' Ms Hammond said. KFOR reports the Oklahoma Highway Patrol is to review Ms Hammond's driver's license photo to ensure it does not violate any rules. If it is found to be within the guidelines the Highway Patrol says it may consider changing the rule regarding religious headwear because it is more than 10 years old. In January Christopher Schaeffer, a council member in Pomfret, New York wore a colander on his head as he was sworn into office. The Austrian authorities allowed Niko Alm to wear the unusual headgear as it is deemed a suitable accessory for his 'Pastafarian' religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster . Lukas Novy exercising his right to wear a sieve on head for religious grounds in official ID for the Czech Republic . Last year a Czech man was allowed to wear his bizarre headgear on his official identity card after officials ruled that turning down his request would be a breach of the country's religious equality laws. In 2011, three years after applying for a new driver's licence, an Austrian man finally received the laminated card - in which he is pictured with an upturned sieve on his head. Niko Alm sent his application for a new driver's licence in 2008 along with a picture of himself with a colander on his head. The stunt got him an invitation to the doctor's to check he was mentally fit to drive, but after three years, his efforts finally paid off. In 2005, a physics graduate from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a form of protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow the teaching of Intelligent Design as an alternative to evolution in public schools. By professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and meatballs, Bobby Henderson, 24, called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time in science classrooms alongside Christian theory. Word rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in Europe. The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'.","Shawna Hammond was permitted the unusual headgear in Oklahoma .

"Possible ban: Miniskirts could be prohibited in SOuth Korea after President Park Geun-hye approved a government decree, meaning that those deemed to be overexposed in public will be subject to a fine of 50,000 KRW (£30) Miniskirts could be banned in South Korea as a controversial 'overexposure law' comes into effect this week. Those deemed to be overexposed in public will face a fine of 50,000 KRW (£30) under the new law. But the law has been met with criticism after being passed by new president President Park Geun-hye at her first Cabinet meeting. Celebrities from the Asian country have posted pictures of themselves wearing provocative clothing online, while others have suggested the law could signify a wave of authoritarian rule. Opposition leaders also criticised the move, describing it as curtailing freedom of expression. A comparison has been drawn between the president and her late father Park Chung-hee, who was in charge of the country between 1963 and 1979. Under his leadership, lengthy skirts were prohibited in the 1970s, with those that ended 20 centimetres or more above the knee banned. Democratic United Party member Ki Sik Kim wrote on Twitter: 'Why does the state interfere with how . citizens dress? 'Park Geun-hye's government gives . cause for concern that we are returning to the era when hair length and . skirt length were regulated.' Mini skirts are a fashion staple amongst South Korean females, particularly due to K-pop singers - a popular musical genre that emerged from the country. Nancy Land, a well-known television personality and performance artist, posted a picture of herself on Twitter in response to the law holding a 50,000 KRW note next to her cleavage. Pop singer Lee Hyori wrote on Twitter: 'Is the overexposure fine for real? I'm so dead.' But despite the widespread criticism, police said that the law relates to nudity and public indecency and does not involve clothing. The National Police Agency's Inspector Ko Jun-ho told CNN: 'Any reports that we will be regulating what people are wearing are completely false.' Opposition politicians have also been accused of spreading 'misinformation', with the Government saying promising to publicise the exact nature of the law and how it will be implemented.","Law introduced by new president Park Geun-hye comes into effect this week .

"A Spanish bakery is selling what it claims to be the world's most expensive bread at £93 a loaf. Each 400g (14oz) bread made at the Pan Piña bakery contains wholewheat flour, spelt and dehydrated honey. But what makes this otherwise ordinary loaf extra special? It is also given a 250mg sprinkling of one key extra ingredient:  gold dust. Scroll down for video... Each loaf contains wholewheat flour, spelt, dehydrated honey - and some gold dust . A jar of gold is emptied onto baking tray ready to be mixed in with flour and sprinkled on top . The gold leaf bread costs €117 (£93) and is exported to buyers around the world. It is especially popular in the Costa del Sol region, Russia and Middle Eastern countries, says Juan Manuel Moreno, 41, baker and co-owner at Pan Piña. Moreno's family has been running the bakery in the small village of Algatocin, Malaga Province, Andalusia, for 70 years. Today, Moreno produces more than 50 types of bread in his shop. The gold loaf is his most expensive and incorporates edible gold both inside and outside of the bread. The gold in each loaf has a value of £79, he says, and while he confesses the glitz adds no extra flavour, it does leave buyers with a taste of 'exclusivity' and 'glamour'. Baker and bakery co-owner Juan Manuel adding gold to flour to make the bread mix . Speaking at the Malaga bread fair food festival, Moreno explained: 'The gold itself has no real taste. It just adds a certain sparkle, a lustre to each loaf. 'The rest of the ingredients are organic and super healthy. People believe small amounts of gold are good for the digestion.' He added: 'We have a lot of wealthy visitors from Russia and China here and they are always looking for something new to show how rich they are.' The loaves are aimed at the upper crust of society including wealthy Russian and Chinese customer . The bread, which Moreno says is popular with Arab, Russian and Chinese buyers, is left to rise . Moreno told Spain's ABC newspaper he came up with the idea after seeing the 'world's most expensive coffee' on sale at another business in the region. He says Arab, Russian and Chinese buyers based on the Costa de Sol have shown the most interest in the bread. However, a national supermarket chain is set to start selling the product while a restaurant in Ronda has expressed an interest.

"An elementary school teacher has been charged over alleged sexual activity with a 12-year-old male student. Whitney Fair Mullen, 34, was in court on Thursday in Senatobia, Mississippi on charges of molestation and sexual battery of a child. Mullen is a former teacher at Strayhorn Elementary School in Tate County and is believed to have a young daughter. Scroll down for video . Former elementary school teacher Whitney Fair Mullen, 34, appeared in court Thursday morning in Senatobia, Mississippi on charges of molestation and sexual battery of a child . The boy, now 18, came forward recently and claimed that he had been abused by Mullen when he was just 12 years old back in 2008 . Senatobia police said the alleged victim, who is now 18, recently revealed the alleged abuse. Police reported uncovering messages exchanged between the teacher and student. The teen claimed that the abuse had taken place since 2008 but investigators said that it did not take place on school grounds. Mullen no longer works for Tate County schools. It is unclear if there are other victims. It is alleged that the victim was abused at Mullen's home where he was doing odd jobs. The court set Mullen's initial bond at $5million but it was later reduced to $250,000. She hid her face with her hair from TV cameras as she exited court escorted by two police officers in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The alleged victim and his family described the torment they have suffered following the alleged abuse. The father, who remained anonymous to protect his son, said that the family had great respect for teachers and perhaps had placed too much trust in Mullen. He told WMC: 'Maybe it was a little too naive, I guess is the word, but a terrible price was paid. It's impacted his life, from the time he was 12 'til now.' The case is due to heard by a grand jury.

"Furious relatives of British soldiers killed in Afghanistan tonight hit out at the 'disgusting' behaviour of peers in the House of Lords - after they were filmed walking out while the names of six fallen servicemen were read out. The former head of the Army blasted those who poured out . of the Upper Chamber while those who had died since the beginning of March . were remembered. Among those who paid the ultimate sacrifice included the five personnel who were killed in last month's tragic helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Dozens of peers got up to walkout out as Lib Dem minister Lady Northover rose to pay tribute to soldiers killed in Afghanistan . Former Army chief Lord Dannatt told Lady Northover that no-one should move in the House of Lords when tributes are being paid . Outraged, General Lord Dannatt rose to his feet and said on a military base no one moves while the Last Post is being played, and the same should apply in Parliament. Lord Hill, Tory leader in the Lords, later apologised for an offence caused, but stressed peers 'intended no disrepesct'. He spoke out after Government minister Baroness Northover made a statement on Afghanistan. This began, as is customary, with a tribute to those who had died in Afghanistan since the last statement on the country in February. It included the five troops killed when their helicopter plunged to the ground over a Taliban stronghold near the border with Pakistan last month and a soldier who died in an accident at Camp Bastion, the UK base, in March. Mourners gather to pay their respects as the cortege passes by following the repatriation of five British servicemen who were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan .

Chauhan (not pictured) Sapper Adam Moralee of the 32 Engineer Regiment Group who died in Afghanistan as a result of non-battle-related injuries sustained at Camp Bastion . Lib Dem minister Lady Northover began her statement: 'I should like to pay tribute to the six service personnel who have died serving their country in Afghanistan since the last statement on Afghanistan. 'They include Sapper Adam Moralee, who was killed on 5 March while preparing equipment for redeployment out of Afghanistan as part of our military drawdown. 'On 26 April, five UK service personnel—Captain Thomas Clarke, acting Warrant Officer Class 2 Spencer Faulkner, Corporal James Walters, Flight Lieutenant Rakesh Chauhan and Lance Corporal Oliver Thomas—were tragically killed in a helicopter crash south of Kandahar. 'A full investigation is under way into the incident but there is currently no indication of enemy activity being a contributing factor. It was the third biggest single loss of UK life since 2001. 'These deaths are a timely reminder that our troops continue to risk their lives in Afghanistan every single day.' The red benches were packed as the clerks worked through a series of procedural matters . As Lady Northover stood at the Despatch Box, peers on all sides made a break for the door . It meant that she was mid-way through the tributes to six dead forces personnel as peers abandoned their seats . But as she spoke began, the majority of around 400 peers who had been listening to other Parliamentary business walked out. Lord Dannatt, who was Chief of the General Staff from 2006 to 2009, said: ‘I am very conscious that what I am about to say may not make me universally popular. 'I was in command of the Army from 2006 to 2009. It will not have escaped the notice of noble Lords that this Chamber was packed to the gunnels at the start of Question Time for discussion of the Thames tideway tunnel and other important matters. 'However, when the Minister began to draw attention to those who had fallen, noble Lords streamed out of this House in a way that was most unfortunate, given that six of our comrades had lost their lives.' The International Development minister ended up addressing a near-empty House of Lords . He argued that in future ministers should let all parties know when tributes are being paid to prevent a repeat of the snub. 'On a military base no one moves during the Last Post. In your Lordships’ House, I respectfully suggest that no one moves while a tribute is being paid to the fallen. 'The fallen have done their best to give the Afghans the opportunity of a better life in the future. We have done our best; it is now over to the Afghans to make the best of what we have given them.' Lady Northover said: ‘I left a gap as people were beginning to leave. I hoped they would hear what I was saying, but I think some of them didn’t realise. ‘I saw people pause and stop and I realise when people were actually hearing what I was saying they were responding. But I think you are absolutely right.’ Lord Hill of Oareford, the Leader of the Lords, said: ‘When service personnel lose their lives in the line of duty, the custom in the House of Lords is that the defence minister pays tribute to them at the first available opportunity. ‘That is exactly what happened on 6 May when tributes were paid by the defence minister to those who had died most recently in Afghanistan. ‘Those tributes, echoed by spokesmen for all the parties in the House of Lords, were of course listened to with full respect as is usual. ‘Peers had not realised that in the statement on 14 May these tributes would be repeated. In leaving the Chamber as is usual after questions, peers therefore intended no disrespect to the memories of those who had died.

"Britain’s next generation military drone has ‘surpassed all expectations’ in its first test flight. Taranis, which is named after the Celtic god of thunder, is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. It took to the air for the first time in August, but footage of the flight has only just been released. Scroll down for video . BAE also announced its Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle demonstrator Taranis has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing. During tests, Taranis (pictured) flew in a fully 'stealthy' configuration, making it virtually invisible to radar . Taranis is the UK's next generation military drone, named after the Celtic god of thunder. It is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. The autonomous vehicle made its first test flight in August, when it took off, rotated, climbed and landed at various speeds and altitudes. BAE Systems which made the aircraft, described it as ‘the most advanced aircraft ever built by British engineers’. Taranis cost £185million to develop and was funded jointly by the UK MOD and UK industry. The drone is around the same size as a Hawk fighter jet and is the result of one-and-a-half million hours of work by UK engineers from over 250 companies. The pilotless combat aircraft made ‘a . perfect take-off, rotation, “climb out” and landing on its first . flight,' according to BAE systems, which made the drone. The British defence firm described its largest drone as ‘the most advanced aircraft ever built by British engineers’ and test pilot Bob Fraser tried it out for a 15 minute flight at ‘an undisclosed test range’ in August. The advanced weapon, which could spearhead the fight against terror in Africa, cost £185million to develop and was funded jointly by the UK MOD and UK industry. It made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour, the company said. Taranis (graphic pictured) is named after the Celtic god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. During tests, Taranis also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position . The drone is around the same size as a Hawk fighter jet and while it was first unveiled in July 2010, it has not been seem flying before now, The Huffington Post reported. Taranis is the result of one-and-a-half million hours of work by UK engineers from over 250 companies, but only a select group have a lot of access to the secret aircraft. ‘Taranis is providing vital insights that will help shape future capabilities for our Armed Forces in coming decades. 'Its advanced technology is testament to the UK's world leading engineering skills that keep Britain at the cutting edge of defence,’ Philip Dunne, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology said. Military chiefs believe Taranis’ ground-breaking technology will allow a powerful new generation of drones equipped with deadly payloads to fly from British bases and attack targets worldwide. The new drone has made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour, BAE Systems said . But the new developments in pilotless aircraft are controversial as they allow the possibility of autonomous computers targeting and killing enemy combatants outside human control. Experts have previously warned that the new technology would potentially lead to a nightmarish scenario of out-of-control robots waging war on humans and have even called for a global ban on autonomous technology. Britain’s armed drones are currently piloted remotely by aircrews on the ground, but Taranis will follow a set flightpath using on-board computers to perform manoeuvres, avoid threats and identify targets. Taranis, pictured in flight, is the result of one-and-a-half million hours of work by UK engineers from over 250 companies, but only a select group have had a lot of access to the top secret aircraft . Only when it needs to attack a target will it seek authorisation from a human controller. ‘This is a very dangerous move. Once it has been developed, who knows what new governments who inherit the technology will do with it,’ Professor Noel Sharkey, a robotics engineer specialising in autonomous military systems at Sheffield University, said last January. Last year David Cameron warned that the fight against terrorism in North Africa could last decades, meaning futuristic drones could dominate counter-terrorism strategy in the region. British Forces operate armed drones in Afghanistan, where they target Taliban insurgents and the UK Government has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft which can fly distances of more than 2,000 miles.

"A Ukrainian military transport plane which was shot down along the country's eastern border was likely to have been hit by a rocket fired from neighbouring Russia, Ukraine's defence minister has claimed. Rebels in conflict-wracked eastern Ukraine immediately claimed responsibility for downing the Antonov-26 which authorities say may have been carrying up to 20 people. But Ukrainian defence minister Valeriy Heletey said the plane was flying at an altitude of 21,300 feet, which is too high to be reached with separatists' weapons. The tail-section of the Ukraine military An-26 transport aircraft which was shot down close to the Russian border. Pro-Russian rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the attack . The shooting followed a Moscow threat to use  'surgical retaliatory strikes', according to respected newspaper Kommersant. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the report. 'I don't comment on this in any way. It's complete nonsense.' In the last two weeks, the government has halved the territory held by pro-Russia separatists, who have been forced back into strongholds around the eastern cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. Those two mostly Russian-speaking regions have declared independence from the government in Kiev. Fighting intensified around Luhansk as government forces stepped up efforts to disrupt rebel lines and reclaim more territory from the faltering insurgency. One resident said panic was gripping the city. Despite reports of military successes, however, Ukraine's president announced he has more evidence that Russia has directly supported a separatist insurgency against his government that is dragging into its fourth month.

Russian state television has aired an unconfirmed report claiming the . Ukrainian army publicly nailed a three-year-old boy to a board in a . former rebel stronghold. In . move that has provoked a storm of criticism, Channel One broadcast an . interview in which a woman gave graphic details of the alleged incident. She . said she recently saw Ukrainian soldiers round up people in  the . Ukrainian flashpoint city of Slavyansk and nail an insurgent's child to a . notice board. Attempts . to corroborate the report have so far failed and Ukraine responded by . accusing Russia of ratcheting up its propaganda war. A spokeswoman for Ukraine's interior ministry, Natalya Stativko, on Monday slammed the report as 'following in the footsteps of Goebbels,' Nazi Germany's minister of propaganda. 'The cruder and the more monstrous the lie, the better it will look for the Russian propaganda machine,' Stativko said.

Opposition leader Alexei Navalny denounced the channel as 'nutty' for airing the report. 'Are . they completely sick to be concocting this?' he wrote on his blog. 'The . people behind this are a danger to society and what they are doing is a . true crime.' Representatives of Channel One declined immediate comment. The report featured a woman named as Galina Pyshnyak, who was interviewed at a refugee camp in Russia, describing the incident that she labelled an act of revenge. 'They gathered women on the square because there are no more men. Women, girls, old people,' Pyshnyak said. 'They took a child of around three years old, a little boy in his underwear and a T-shirt and nailed him to a notice board like Jesus. One was nailing him and two others holding him.'

Russia's defence ministry said today that Ukrainian jets carried out five air strikes against separatist positions close to Lugansk but there was no confirmation of rebel claims that Kiev had massed tanks in the outskirts ahead of a major push into the city. Meanwhile, the Kremlin today  threatened military strikes on Ukraine in an alarming escalation of the worst conflict between former member countries of the Soviet Union. Russia is swelling its troop numbers again on the border with Ukraine amid new fears of an invasion of the east of the country, claimed Kiev sources yesterday. The force could be sabotage squads or masked as 'peacekeepers', warned military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk. Tymchuk claimed Russian special forces and intelligence brigades were massing across the border from Ukraine's Donetsk territory. 'Special force units are coming to Rostov region,' he said. 'This is reconnaissance and sabotage groups of staff brigades of the Russian GRU intelligence special forces. 'According to our data, the commanders of these units have been told that they will be brought into the territory of Ukraine on July 15.' Tymchuk, coordinator of the Information Resistance Group, has previously accurately predicted troop deployments in the bloody conflict which has seen almost 600 people killed in the EU's backyard. He warned that Russian forces could be sent into Ukraine as ""peacekeepers"" or in green uniforms without insignia as happened when Crimea was grabbed  in March. Or a wave of sabotage squads could be sent into Ukraine to back ""terrorists"" - as pro-Western Kiev refers to insurgent pro-Moscow fighters. Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko yesterday claimed Russian troops were already fighting alongside the rebels inside his country. 'Russian staff officers are taking part in military operations against Ukrainian forces,' he said. And official sources echoed the fears of a troop build-up, the month after Vladimir Putin assured Western leaders his armed forces were going back to their barracks. 'Deployment of Russian units and military equipment across the border from the Sumy and Luhansk border points was noticed. The Russian Federation continues to build up troops on the border,' warned Ukraine national security council spokesman Andriy Lysenko. Kiev insists that a Russian man killed at a border town was shot by pro-Moscow separatists in an act of provocation. 'Fighters systematically fire mortars and shoot into Russian territory, which killed a Russian citizen,"" said Lysenko. The threat will cause deep concern in the West and comes amid reports of residents fleeing the city of Donetsk amid fears of a major battle between Ukrainian troops and rebels. Moscow is considering 'surgical retaliatory strikes' on the Ukrainian territory following claims that people in Russia were killed and wounded after being struck by shells from across the border. 'Our patience is not boundless,' a source told Kommersant newspaper, owned by Arsenal Football Club shareholder Alisher Usmanov. 'This means not a massive action but exclusively targeted single strikes on positions from which the Russian territory is fired at.' The Russian side 'knows for sure the site where the fire comes from', said the source. , . The proposed plan echoes a statement by a deputy speaker of Russia's upper house, Yevgeniy Bushmin, who told RIA Novosti news agency that using precision weapons in response to Ukraine's shelling would prevent further Kiev's attacks of Russian territory. 'There is a feeling that if before firing was not aimed against Russian border guards, now provocations have been on the rise as there is no other means of forcing us to join in the standoff with Ukraine's security troops,' he said. 'The only way to fight against this like civilised countries do, namely the US and the EU. We should use precision weapons, like Israel, to destroy those who fired this shell.' Ukraine claimed that the attack was staged by pro-Moscow rebels, denying any involvement by its armed forces. One Russian citizen was reported killed when a shell exploded in a yard of a house in a small border town also called Donetsk, the same name as the Ukrainian city. Another shell hit a house, injuring two women, a 82-year-old mother and her daughter. The elderly woman was hospitalised with concussion and fractures. Meanwhile there were reports that rebels have started using a Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft - their first warplane - against Ukrainian forces. Today's threat from the Kremlin followed a warning on Sunday by the Russian foreign ministry of 'irreversible consequences' from the border 'attack'. Moscow deemed it 'an extremely dangerous escalation' . Kiev claims that Moscow is arming rebels with Grad multiple-rocket system, and alleged any shooting across the Ukraine-Russian frontier was by insurgent fighters and not its armed forces. The Kremlin allegation was 'total nonsense', it claimed. Moscow earlier appeared to pull back tens of thousands of troops close to the border amid fears it could invade eastern Ukraine. The Russian senate also rescinded permission for Vladimir Putin to deploy forces in Ukraine.","Antonov-26 transport aircraft was shot down close to the Russian border .

"Nutty: Sneezy the squirrel is so tame she lets Penn State University student Mary Krupa dress her up in a range of fetching hats . A university student has struck up an incredible relationship with a tiny squirrel named Sneezy - who lets her dress it up in a range of eye catching hats. Animal-loving Mary Krupa, 18, started feeding peanuts to the squirrels on her campus at Penn State in Pennsylvania, USA, at the beginning of the school year. Over time she noticed they were becoming more friendly and inching closer to her - with one in particular comfortable enough to eat straight from her hand. And as the level of trust between the . pair continued to grow Mary decided that simply stroking the squirrel . was no longer enough - so she began placing miniature hats on her new friend. She . said: 'One day I was sitting under a tree and some kids nearby were . feeding a group of squirrels and they weren't running away - so I . decided to try the same thing. 'They . got friendlier and friendlier, particularly Sneezy, but I honestly . don't know what inspired me to put hats on her - I just wanted to see . what I could do as it was funny. 'I . had a tiny doll hat with me and tried it. Amazingly she sat there with . it on long enough for me to take a picture. It was so cute. 'Then . I started making different hats including a special birthday hat as it . was my grandmother's birthday so I sent her a picture which she loved.' Ms Krupa makes most of the hats herself - with some simply computer print outs that she folds up. Others she finds at craft stores. She said she had, had lots of positive reaction to the pictures so far. 'Everyone in town and on campus loves it ,' she said. Popular: Sneezy is so popular with students at Penn State she has even had a Facebook page created in his honour which has been liked by nearly 6,500 people . Suave: Sneezy has been pictured wearing a range of cute outfits, including a fez (left) and a chef's hat . Festive: The squirrel marked the Christmas season with a party hat (left) and a shiny green bow . 'People call me the 'Squirrel Whisperer,' she said. 'In total I have probably made and photographed a few more than 20 hats and plan to keep on going as long as Sneezy is enjoying it too.' Sneezy is so popular with students at Penn State he now has his own Facebook page, which has been liked by nearly 6,500 people. Close: Ms Krupa, 18, has struck up a remarkable relationship with Sneezy since befriending him . The page features a selection of pictures of the squirrel in various costumes, under the caption 'A friendly little squirrel who wears hats to brighten up your day!' Squirrels are naturally inquisitive animals with those who live close to, or among humans, sometimes prepared to approach them for food. The animals have very accurate spatial memories - used to a large degree to remember where they have buried caches of nuts. Squirrels have even been known to pretend to bury nuts if they feel they are being watched by a rival. They do this by digging a hole and miming the placement of the nut, while actually keeping it in their mouths. They need to be quick witted to avoid a wide range of predators including humans, hawks, weasels, raccoons, and cats. Squirrels belong to a large family of rodents called the Sciuridae. This includes a wide range of species, such as tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots, flying squirrels, and prairie dogs. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and have been introduced to Australia. The introduction of grey squirrels to Britain has been blamed by conservationists for causing a steep decline in the country's native red squirrel population. Eye catching: Sneezy wears a graduation cap (left) and keeps out the cold with some comfy earmuffs (right) Cool: The rodent appears not to mind after having a baseball cap and a cowboy hat perched on his head .

"ABC Family has canceled a controversial new pilot called Alice in Arabia after its leaked script sparked intense backlash for being racist. Written by a former U.S. Army translator Brooke Eikmeier, the teen drama centers around an American girl 'kidnapped' by her Saudi Arabian grandfather, who happens to have the same name as an infamous member of Al Qaeda. After a promotional description for the pilot was criticized, Eikmeier defended herself claiming the actual show was a sensitive and balanced portrayal of Saudi Arabian culture. Backlash: Written by former U.S. Army translator Brooke Eikmeier, pictured, the teen drama centers around an American girl 'kidnapped' by her Saudi Arabian grandfather . However, when the episode's draft script . was leaked, revealing that the series was as racist as first thought, . the fury erupted, and ABC Family moved to cancel it. 'The current conversation surrounding our pilot was not what we had envisioned and is certainly not conducive to the creative process, so we've decided not to move forward with this project,' ABC Family said in a statement. As well as the online onslaught, the network was contacted by Muslim advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations who requested a meeting with community leaders. Reference: One of the most offensive parts is the name chosen for her grandfather, Abu Hamza. In reality, Abu Hamza is an Islamic extremist cleric, pictured, who is facing charges including planning to open a jihadist training camp in the U.S. 'We are concerned that, given media references to the main character ""surviving life behind the veil,"" the pilot and any resulting series may engage in stereotyping that can lead to things like bullying of Muslim students,' executive director Hussam Ayloush said Wednesday. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee also expressed concern about the show 'promoting bigotry and stereotyping of millions of Arabs and Arab-Americans, and billions of Muslims around the world,' according to Buzzfeed. According to Deadline Hollywood, Eikmeier wrote the script while serving as cryptologic linguist in the Arabic language to the U.S. Army stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, where she supported NSA missions in the Middle East. Alice is a rebellious American teen who goes to visit her grandfather in Saudi Arabia amid a family emergency but he then hides her passport so she can't go home. She watches Project Runway and sneaks out to parties while Muslim women who wear veils are portrayed as 'completely formless, anonymous.' One of the most offensive parts however, is the name chosen for her grandfather, Abu Hamza. In reality, Abu Hamza is an Islamic extremist cleric who is facing charges including planning to open a jihadist training camp in the U.S. The hashtag #AliceInArabia became a trending Twitter topic last week after ABC Family released the synopsis.","The show centers around an American girl 'kidnapped' by her Saudi Arabian grandfather .

"Last month’s Bafta TV awards saw Judi Dench and Helen Mirren take a back seat as another name stepped into the limelight. After years of High Street obscurity, the department store House of Fraser staged an almost complete red-carpet takeover. Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Amber le Bon, Susanna Reid and Kate Garraway, among others, all wore beautiful swishing floor-length bejewelled gowns sold by the store. It was a fashion coup that, overnight, propelled House of Fraser back into middle-class consciousness. In House of Fraser: Singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor at the Baftas . Since then sales of Biba evening wear, worn by Susanna Reid and Kate Garraway on the night, have more than doubled. But it’s simplistic to say the forgotten department store’s success is down to one night of headlines. In fact, House of Fraser has been quietly creeping up on its competitors for some time. It announced record sales of £1.2 billion in 2013, which were up £30 million on the year before. It’s a figure that’s a long way from the £4.4 million losses it suffered in 2005. So why is the chain succeeding where its competitors, including Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, are facing difficulties? Stylist Annabel Kerman thinks part of the reason is that it offers a vast array of sophisticated labels compared with other department stores, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams in particular. Indeed, the number of womenswear brands across House of Fraser stores and online is 500 and counting. Pretty in pink: Amber Le Bon wearing House of Fraser at the Baftas . More importantly, Kerman thinks House of Fraser’s unique labels give sales a big boost. ‘It has a vast number of different designers that you can’t get anywhere else on the High Street such as Biba, Pied A Terre and Mary Portas.’ It’s here that House  of Fraser has changed  tack dramatically, with  such success. Where it used to sell a multitude of concessions such as Warehouse, Principles, Oasis and Nine West — brands that often had a stand-alone store just a few doors down the High Street — now it’s chosen to favour in-house labels and exciting new designers not seen elsewhere. And it is finally listening to the customer. Since 2011, the store has been cleverly analysing the feedback it receives from customers, both online and in store. It has encouraged House of Fraser to introduce next-evening deliveries everywhere and same-day deliveries within the M25, click-and-collect ordering services, as well as computers that allow you to order from within the store. Another reason for the turn of fortune is down to Stephanie Chen, who joined the company in 2009, heading up the womenswear department. In a previous role at Debenhams, she helped to create the phenomenally  successful Designers at Debenhams range. Stephanie introduced the new Biba and Mary Portas ranges at House of Fraser before restructuring the womenswear department. She left for Marks & Spencer in 2012, and has been tackling their resurgence since. The foundations laid at House of Fraser are still in place — and have been built on with a carefully calibrated move upmarket that hasn’t sacrificed affordability. As well as many £250-plus evening gowns, there are cocktail numbers for well below £100, such as Warehouse’s £60 twist-back maxi dress, or Untold’s chic blue satin dress at £85. Not super-cheap, but very reasonable for occasionwear. Looking Sophisticated: Kate Garraway wears a full-length House of Fraser dress to the Baftas . ‘People feel that a lot of the brands at House of Fraser are a little bit of a treat because they’re more than they’d normally spend, but they’re not totally out of their price range,’ says Kerman. However, the company’s journey from forgotten High Street monolith to desirable destination has not been a smooth one. Established in 1864 as a cloth merchant in Glasgow, House of Fraser was owned by Hugh Fraser and James Arthur. From the Thirties, the Fraser family drove expansion and began to buy up the competition, acquiring more than 50 new stores in the Seventies alone. And while some shops retained their local identity — Edinburgh’s venerable Jenners, for example — most lost their names, rejected in favour of House of Fraser, a result of the branding juggernaut that made the High Streets of the past 20 years so monotonous. Many of those House of Fraser-owned stores have closed in the past two decades to streamline the business, but the move has turned much-loved local landmarks into empty, crumbling buildings. That move may have kept the company in business, but for many shoppers, goodwill was thrown away. Happily for House of Fraser, public opinion seems to have turned again, aided by recent celebrity endorsements on the red carpet. ‘People really like to see celebrities wearing a High Street dress and making it look designer. I think celebrities are definitely changing their attitudes to trying the High Street,’ says Kerman. If she’s right, House of Fraser might just be on to a winning formula.","Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Amber Le Bon and Susanna Reid wore House of Fraser dresses to the BAFTAs .

"The world's fattest man has revealed he has not been able to leave his home for the past ten years. Keith Martin said he specifically remembers the last time he left the house was on 9/11. Since then he has ballooned to 58 stone and was recently revealed as the heaviest man on Earth. Mr Martin, 42, has said his condition has driven him to the brink of suicide and is now desperately trying to lost weight so reduce his 6ft waistline. Keith Martin, the fattest man on Earth, has revealed how he has not left his London home since 9/11 . Having once eaten up to 20,000 calories a day he has now restricted himself to 1,500 calories. At the height of his eating Keith would scoff down a packet of bacon, six sausages, six eggs with a mound of toast and beans. Lunch was more of the same plus . sandwiches and dinner could be two large pizzas, . three kebabs or a giant Chinese curry. Snacks included packets of biscuits . and sweets, cakes and family-size chocolate bars. Before bed he'd have . four sandwiches with ham, Spam or bacon. He drank two litres of cola, . plus six pints of coffee with sugar. Now he has reduced his diet to just four slices of bread, sometimes topped with spam or a can of mini-hotdogs, and one ready meal a day. Mr Martin as a healthy-looking young child . Mr Martin, who is 5ft 9in tall, has already lost 10cm of his girth. 'It's been a tough process, but I've been trying to stick to my new diet . regime. 'Finding out that I'm the fattest man in the world has been the . wake-up call I needed. I don't blame anyone other than myself for this . horrible situation. 'Doctors have told me I won't reach . 50 unless I do something drastic. I need to lose half my weight before . they'll give me a gastric band. 'I'd love to be as slim as I was in my . youth, but what I really want is simply to sit comfortably in a . normal-sized chair. I am determined to get this weight off.' 'I used to eat four Big Macs plus fries and an apple turnover for lunch. Now, I can honestly say I don't even miss food. I have to do this for myself and my family.' Mr Martin revealed how he started cutting back in September when he became bed-bound by two giant hernias which are the size of four bowling balls. Then in January, Keith was visited by a team of healthcare professionals in his home who warned him: 'Take our advice or die.' 'I am trying to heed their advice, but nothing has hit home like the headlines around the world talking about my weight,' he said. 'It has been horrible, but it's made me even more determined.' Mr Martin is a recluse who prefers to find solace in the latest Tom Clancy novel or watching his favourite science fiction films and playing video games on his PlayStation. The last time he left his house - other than four trips to the hospital - was on September 11, 2001, the day terror planes brought down America's World Trade Centre. 'I remember it so clearly because . everywhere people were reacting in horror to the attacks. But for me, . there was a good side to that day because it meant I would no longer . have to leave the house. 'The last thing I did was visit the Jobcentre. It had got to the point where I couldn't walk up the steps to sign on. 'Since then I've been on incapacity benefit, because I haven't been fit or well enough to work, even though I would love to.' Now . stuck in his reinforced bed, each day he is visited by seven carers who . hand wash him and change his sheets. Doctors and nurses make home . visits to check on his health. Each . fortnight he received £303 in benefits shares a three-bedroom terraced . council house in Harlesden, northwest London, with his two sisters. His . elder sister, a former shop clerk who he refuses to name after hurtful . comments were posted about her on websites, is his best friend. Mr Martin's eating started to increase after his mother died and he took comfort in food . She also does the food shopping and most of the cooking. But a tearful Keith lashed out at critics who have blamed her for his size. He said: 'I live with my two sisters - one of them has severe special needs. 'The other is my 54-year-old sister who has done everything for me. 'She would plead with me to eat less, and even trick me into eating smaller portions. She convinced me to make healthier choices, like cooking burgers in the oven rather than frying them. 'But for a long time I could still walk to the kitchen and feed myself. And it was difficult for her to say no to me - she loves me and didn't want to say no when I told her I was hungry and wanted food. 'Whenever I say things like ""I'm a fat waste of space"" or ""I don't want to go on,"" she is there to tell me I'm not allowed to think that. She's incredible and people have no right to judge. 'I should be taking care of my sisters, not the other way around.' The youngest son of eight average-sized kids raised by single mum Alma, Keith was a shy child who loved reading. He said: 'My mum was amazing - always . scrimping and saving to make ends meet. We ate what we could afford - . Spam and mash, egg and chips, mincemeat stew. 'We . ate fruit and veg and my relationship with food was completely normal. At school I was bullied about having big ears. I didn't fit in and I . hated being there, which caused problems.' By the time he was 13, he was skiving so much authorities threatened to take him into care. Instead, . he was sent to a private school for troubled teens in Hampshire. But . then tragically, when he was 16, his mum died of double bronchial . pneumonia. 'It was a total surprise. She'd been in and out of hospital with diabetes and severe asthma, but we never expected it. 'I . felt so sad and guilty for the hassle I'd caused her. I started eating . to ease the pain and before I knew it, I was binging every time . something upset me.' Mr Martin said he would spend an average of £30 a day on food and by the time he turned 25 'was a complete mess'. 'I . was getting bigger but didn't notice until I could no longer fit into . the extra large joggers and T-shirts on the high street. Mr Martin with a selection of some of the foods he used to consume in a day but he is now determined to lose the weight . Behind closed doors, Mr Martin continued to gain weight. By the time he was 32 he was a supersize 5XL and had to buy his clothes from specialist shops online. In 2008, he had to swap his bedroom for a double mattress on the living room floor because he could no longer climb the stairs. By the end of 2010, he had outgrown the 8XL clothing - the largest possible size - and had to lie naked under a sheet. In September 2009 the emergency services were called when he was unable to move and he tipped the scales at a whopping 50 stone. It was also the first time he'd seen a doctor in his adult life. He said: 'I couldn't believe what they said - I thought maybe I weighed half that. And I've continued to gain since. 'I didn't think there was anything I could do. My self esteem was so low - it always has been that I just didn't care about myself. 'I've been to the hospital four times after falling over or because I was having stomach pain or couldn't move. Every time it's the same thing - you need to lose the weight, which I know is right. 'I've got an irregular heart beat, severe asthma, horrible migraines and constant aches and pains. 'The last time I was able to sit in a chair was seven years ago - and that was a two-seater. I used to have to board buses from the back door because I couldn't fit through the bars at the front. 'People in the street would call me ""lardy"" and ""fatso"". They would stare without even trying to hide it. 'It got to the point where I couldn't . take it anymore. The last time I stood was last September when I fell . over and had to be taken to the hospital again. But before that I was . getting around the house on my own at least.' Mr Martin now spends all his time in his reinforced bed, held in by protective barriers. Last year he splashed out on a 42in flatscreen TV because 'that is what I spend all day looking at.' He said: 'I spend a lot of time sleeping because I have so little energy. 'Looking . back at my life, I've always been depressed. I am an agoraphobic - I'm . afraid of public places - and I guess maybe I always have been, but it . was never treated. 'In . a way I don't feel any different to when I was in my teens. I'm the . same person, only now I've got this giant body that hurts all the time. 'I . just want to be happy, without needing food to make me happy. I want to . be able to take my border collie Cheyanne for a walk - I'd take her . wherever she wanted to go.' Mr Martin gets emotional talking about his weight and said he only has himself to blame for his massive size .","Keith Martin consumed up to 20,000 calories and would eat mounds of bread and take-aways .

"Colonel Muammar Gaddafi ordered the kidnap of schoolgirls, who were kept as sex slaves, according to an investigation . Colonel Gaddafi ordered the kidnap of schoolgirls who were then kept as sex slaves at  compound, according to a book on the dictator. One girl, named Soraya, was kidnapped when she was 15 and held for five years in a basement at his six-mile long fortress just outside Tripoli. She says she was violently raped, beaten and abused on an almost daily basis and saw similar abuse of other girls and boys. Her story and those of others who say . they were raped by the despot are told in the book Gaddafi's Harem: The . Story Of A Young Woman And The Abuses Of Power In Libya by French Le . Monde journalist Annick Cojean. It . has sold more than 100,000 copies since it was published in French last . year and the English translation will be released next month. The journalist says men and boys were also raped and Gaddafi also pursued celebrities and the wives of foreign dignitaries. According to her investigation, Ms Cojean says the female bodyguards he famously surrounded himself with, were in fact mistresses with no weapons knowledge. Ms Cojean investigated Gaddafi's abuses of power after meeting Soraya (whose name has been changed), who told her harrowing story. While still at school in the coastal town of Sirte, Soraya was given the 'honour' of presenting a bouquet of flowers to Gaddafi during a visit in 2004. The book features the Soraya's story, who says she was kept for five years in a basement at Gaddafi's huge Tripoli compound Bab al-Azizia (pictured being demolished after his death in 2011) Annick Cojean claims Gaddafi's female bodyguards were made up of mistresses with no weapons training . After presenting the flowers, Gaddafi, . who had eight children, patted her head. She said this was a symbol to . his aids that he wanted her. The . following day she was summoned to his palatial six-mile long compound . near Tripoli, Bab al-Azizia, where she was stripped, shaved and taken to . Gaddafi. She said he was lying naked on the bed and tried to rape her. When she fought him off, Soraya was taken away by head of the harem Mabrouka for 'lessons'. She is quoted in the book as saying: 'He grabbed my hand and forced me to sit next to him on the bed. I didn't dare look at him. 'He said, ""Don't be afraid. I'm your papa. That's what you call me, isn't it? But I'm also your brother and your lover. I'm going to be all that for you. Because you are going to stay and live with me forever.""' Soraya said she was repeatedly raped by Gaddafi after he chose her at a visit to her school in Sirte (pictured) The book has been translated into English after selling 100,000 copies since it was published in French . The schoolgirl was given porn to view and was made to watch Gaddafi have sex with other so she could 'learn'. Boys and his male guards were also raped by the tyrant, according to the book. Soraya was eventually allowed home in 2009 but she says she is a shame to her family because she had sex outside marriage. She said she only felt free from Gaddafi after his death in 2011 at the end of the civil war. The book features interviews with a woman who ferried the girls to Gaddafi's compound and other victims. Ms Cojean also alleges Gaddafi, who was married to Safia Farkash, pursued students and the wives of foreign dignitaries. Ms Cojean was quoted in the New York Daily News as writing: 'It was not so much about seducing a woman as, through her, humiliating the man who is supposed to be responsible for her.' Female visitors were routinely subjected to blood tests by Gaddafi's nurses to make sure they were disease free in case he wanted to have sex with them. Marie Colvin, the Sunday Times journalist killed in Syria in 2012, reported that a nurse had approached her with a needle when she was in Tripoli to interview Gaddafi. She declined to give blood.","Gaddafi chose schoolgirls and kept them as sex slaves, book claims .

Robinson, who passed away in his sleep at his New York home, was only 17 when he was hired by Batman creator Bob Kane. The two met by chance at a resort in . the Catskill Mountains, where Robinson had a summer job selling ice . cream. Kane noticed Robinson because he was wearing a white jacket . decorated with his own illustrations. Arch enemies: Batman and Robin and their nemesis The Joker . In the early 1940s, Robinson . 'illustrated some of the defining images of pop culture's greatest . icons,' said Jim Lee, co-publisher of DC Entertainment Inc, the parent . company of Batman publisher DC Comics. He drew many of the most striking covers . from the golden age of comics, such as that of 'Batman' No. 13, showing . the caped crusader gliding to the ground by parachute. While Robinson is credited by many . comic enthusiasts as the primary creator of The Joker for issue No. 1 of . Batman, he and Kane clashed over who was first to dream up the caped . crusader's nemesis. In a 1994 interview, Kane said he and . writer Bill Finger had come up with the idea and Robinson then produced . a joker playing card for inspiration . Comic strip king: Artist Jerry Robinson one of the original Batman team and creator of The Joker with some of his original artwork . Robinson, a native of Trenton, New Jersey, used his fame and position in the industry to serve as its ambassador, and he fought for other artists and creators to win credit for their work especially in the Superman series. In the 1930s and '40s, publishers owned the rights and would discard drawings after they were used. In the 1950s, he started drawing newspaper comic strips, political cartoons and cover illustrations for Broadway's 'Playbill.' Later Robinson taught at New York's School of Visual Arts and was president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists and the National Cartoonists Society. An editor and friend, Charles Kochman, . said Robinson was different from most artists in the field because he . worked on every kind of comic genre. 'Jerry brought a realism to comics and . a sense of humor,' said Kochman, his editor at Abrams Comic Arts, which . last year published a book called Jerry Robinson: Ambassador of Comics. 'He saw the value of comics as an art,' Kochman said. In recent years, rare issues of comic books have fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars at auction. Robinson also served as a historian, writing The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art and curating gallery exhibits, including one of the biggest at the Kennedy Library in Washington in 1973 that included all the genres of the strip comic art form. Mike Marts, editor of the Batman line at DC Comics, said Robinson was 'an innovator, a pioneer in storytelling.' He added: 'The streets of Gotham City are a little lonelier today.'",'The streets of Gotham City are a little lonelier today'
"It is a measure of what Diego Simeone is achieving at Atletico Madrid that when they beat Real Madrid on Wednesday night it was their third consecutive derby win and it is the first time they have managed that in 65 years. This is the club that went 14 years without beating their richer capital rivals. Fernando Torres had never beaten Real before but then he had never tried with Simeone on the touchline barking orders, conducting the crowd, celebrating with son Guiliano who was ball-boy for the night. Atletico’s manic manager can do no wrong. He watches Thibaut Courtois, Diego Costa and Felipe Luis leave for Chelsea in the summer – no problem, he just builds another indestructible side. He rests key players because he knows he has Barcelona away on Sunday – no problem, the Atletico B defender Lucas, previously out of favour Mario Suarez, and second choice keeper Oblak all do fine. Atletico Madrid manager Simeone issues instructions from the sidelines at the Vicente Calderon stadium . Diego Simeone embraces Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti before their sides clashed on Wednesday night . He brings back 30-year-old Torres – no problem he runs around for an hour like a 21-year. Simeone could probably bring back Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Christian Vieri and that would work out too. How does he do it? There is an energy and an intensity about the man that transmits to his team but it would be doing him a disservice to reduce the magic to fist waving and shouting. Simeone’s teams are very difficult to beat. The well drilled defence is protected by a wall of four tireless midfielders and often one of the front two. They press in packs when they have to take the game to the opposition and they defend deeply and impenetrably when they have the lead. Diego Simeone's youngest son Giuliano can't hide his joy after Atletico Madrid take the lead on Wednesday . Simeone hugs his son after his Atletico Madrid side doubled their lead in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey . The Argentine is also the master of setting the agenda. Last season he repeated his ‘one game at a time’ mantra to such an extent that the huge pressure on the team – mounting as they came ever closer to what at the start of the season looked like an impossible league title – shifted to the coach and his obsession with this partido-a-partido phrase. He regularly used Jose Mourinho-style ‘little-horse’ kidology in that monumental battle with Barcelona and Real Madrid and it was both more believable and more effective. And like Mourinho he has a strong team around him with Mono Burgos, his former Atletico team-mate is his loyal number two, and Oscar Ortega is the fitness coach who drives that intensity in training that Simeone demands during games. Atletico Madrid's Raul Garcia wheels away after opening the scoring with a second-half penalty on Wednesday . There is a togetherness created by the coach that carries Atletico clear of the more divided dressing rooms at the bigger wealthier clubs. His preference for players to all eat around a big table rather than in cliques at various tables, and his tactic of speaking to them individually before they turn in for the night before games – almost as if he wants them to dream those final match day instructions play a part in his very particular method. He says he is still learning and improving. He perhaps let his heart rule his head in last year’s Champions League final by playing Costa from the start only to have to substitute him injured. And he then lost his head, taking to the pitch in the second half after the ball was kicked in his direction. But even the weaknesses add to the legend because they are born of his passion for winning. The former Argentina international, talking to an official,  is regularly animated on the touchline . Would he win elsewhere should he move on? The communion he has with the supporters as a former player and captain would be hard to replicate and part of his success in Spain comes from Atletico being a physical force that teams in the Premier League might be more able to cope with than some sides in La Liga. But it would be fascinating finding out. His English is limited but he is driven enough to change that if the right opportunity came along. For the time being it’s difficult to see how anyone would be able to tempt him away from the team he is building on the banks of the Manzanares. Antoine Griezmann, Koke, Saul Ñiguez and Jose Giminez are all very young players – the basis is there for the team to keep moving forward at least until 2017 when Simeone’s contract runs out. The Argentine national job would be the obvious next step. But the cue of Premier League owners making sure things do not follow a logical path gets that little bit longer ever time his side turns over a Spanish superpower in front of a global audience. Real Madrid last night… Barcelona up next on Sunday.","Atletico Madrid beat city rivals Real Madrid 2-0 in the Copa del Rey .

"A doctor, who was confronted by anti-abortion campaigners, told them that 'aborting ugly black babies' was a service to the taxpayer. Doctor Ron Virmani was captured on camera last month by pro-life Christian group, Operation Save America. Two activists wearing T-shirts with religious slogans approached the ob-gyn's door in Charlotte, North Carolina. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Dr Ron Virmani made the horrific remarks when members of a Christian pro-life group visited his home in Charlotte, North Carolina . In the short clip, the man who is holding the front door ajar, can be heard saying: 'Don't put pregnancy and adoption on the taxpayers.' A campaigner then asks: 'What does that got to do with the babies?' Virmani replies: 'Don't put it on the taxpayers, okay? I don't wish to pay for the baby with my money.' A female campaigner then asks the doctor: 'You would rather profit off of those children?' Confrontation: Operation Save America had gone to visit the doctor after he became known to them as someone who performed abortions . He responded: 'No, no, no. I am not profiting. I, as a taxpayer, do not wish to pay for those babies to be born and brought up and kill those people in Colorado.' He allegedly is referring to the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado where 12 people and an unborn child died and 58 people were injured. The doctor continues: 'Go ahead and pay for them. Let me see you adopt one of those ugly black babies. The church members respond: 'If you tell us, we'll adopt them.'

Operation Save America is a fundamentalist, conservative Christian group based in Dallas, Texas who campaign against abortion. Day Gardner, president of the National Black Pro-Life Union, expressed outrage over the doctor's comments. He said in a statement: 'It’s all too obvious that he had a particular disgust for black babies and therefore has no problem killing them.'",Christian fundamentalists Operation Save America went to visit Dr Ron Virmani in North Carolina .
"Manu Tuilagi, all tribal tattoos and rippling muscles, is seen as the human wrecking ball of the  England rugby squad set to play Ireland in Dublin today. Recognised around the world as one of the most exciting talents in the game, the 6ft and 17st Manu will be hoping to make a huge impact on this year’s Six Nations tournament following his return from injury. But back in the small beach village of Fatausi-Fogapoa, on the Samoan island of Savai’i where he grew up, the 21-year-old is far from being the most conspicuous member of the Tuilagi clan. For there it is his equally strapping 6ft brother Olotuli who catches the eye – dressed as a woman and known as Julie. Night out: Manu Tuilagi is close to his cross-dressing brother, who calls himself Julie . Julie is the third eldest of seven boys in the Tuilagi family – five of whom have professional rugby careers, including Manu, the youngest, who plays for Leicester Tigers. Julie, 34, has previously shied away from media attention. But now in her first interview, given exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, she has told of her delight when Manu buys her make-up and designer handbags. And she explains how she has steered clear of the sport which dominates her family – happy instead to stay at home and do the ironing for her elderly parents. ‘Never in my life have I played rugby,’ she shudders. ‘I’m not a very rugby lady. My favourite sport is netball. However, if I played professional rugby then I would do better than the others. I am a very strong woman!’ She may joke about her physical strength, but Julie – who enjoys strutting around in perilous stilettos and has a passion for glamorous dresses – certainly exhibits a stoutness of character. In the UK, Julie would be described as a transvestite and her striking looks would command significant attention. But in Samoa, she attracts barely a second glance because of the deep-rooted Polynesian culture of the fa’afafine, or third gender, which defies Western sexual conventions. Back home: Manu Tuilagi's brother, pictured here, as cross-dresser Julie . Known for their hard work and dedication to the family, the fa’afafine – which translates simply as ‘in the manner of woman’ – are ubiquitous in the South Pacific nation. Born male, they are said to embody both genders and can have relationships with both men and, less commonly, women. Julie remains silent on her relationships and will only bashfully describe them as ‘confidential’. But she resolved from a very young age to live as a woman, apparently without difficulty.Julie grew up knowing she was different in a well-respected family. Her father, Tuilagi Vavae, was a former politician and the high chief of the village council, while her mother, Aliitasi, ran the local food shop.  ‘I was born a fa’afafine,’ Julie explains, simply. ‘I realised I was a fa’afafine when I was really young. It’s natural. ‘When I grew up, I did lots of girly things. I wore a girl’s dress and my parents let my hair grow long, even when I was at primary school.’ It is inconceivable to most parents in Britain that their son could happily attend school dressed as a girl. But in Samoa, Julie says, it was unremarkable. ‘I always played with girls and I always hung around with them. There were lots of my fa’afafine friends who used to go to school together. ‘My parents understand the life of fa’afafine, they understand and accept me – the boys do too. ‘I feel sorry for those people who discriminate against us. We do not have a problem – they are the ones with the problem.’ In a recent interview, Manu said of Julie: ‘It’s just the way he is. He was born like that and he wants to dress up as a woman. But not just dress up, he lives the life of a woman – he has the eyelashes, eyebrows, has make-up done and wears a bra. It doesn’t matter. He’s our brother and a great guy. He is just different.’ Growing up, Julie dedicated herself to helping her parents around the house, taking on the role of dutiful daughter. It is a respected part of the fa’afafine tradition and Julie has accepted it gladly. ‘I cook for them, I tidy, I iron their clothes. That’s the life of a fa’afafine in Samoa,’ she explains. ‘They help and do everything in the family.’ Julie is, in effect, gay as she is attracted to men. Some of Julie’s friends have embarked on surgery to become more feminine and to formally change genders. Julie has not so far made this decision, but has not ruled it out. ‘Some of my fa’afafine friends have had their full operation and got married. I haven’t had any surgery but maybe in the future, if I want to. ‘For me, I would rather stay alone and keep myself as a princess rather than become a slave of some kind. If I am thinking of getting married, then I’m getting married to a man. I haven’t made up my mind. I want to stay alone at the moment.’ Despite her domestic commitments, Julie has an openly flamboyant side. ‘Of course I dress up,’ she admits. ‘When we  go out, I dress up like  a princess, I dress up like a model. Everywhere I go – nightclubs, town – I dress up like a supermodel. It’s my personal choice. ‘Manu and I are very close. We respect each other because we are from a very respected family. My family support me. Without them, I would never dress up like this. ‘I’m the only princess in the Tuilagi family, but if Manu wants to wear one of my dresses that’s all right, no problem.’ But while Julie enjoys nightclubs, she also holds some deeply rooted religious beliefs. The Tuilagi family are regular churchgoers and, when Julie spent the period between 2003 and 2006 living in Leicester with her rugby-playing brothers, their parents would ring on Sundays to make sure they were going to church. In action England rugby international Manu Tuilagi is making a name for himself for the national team, while his cross-dressing brother is a big name back home . At the time, Julie’s brothers Freddie and Henry were playing for Leicester Tigers, a third brother Andy was also living in Leicester, and Alesana was playing in Italy. It is clear that living as a woman, in the body of a muscular, tall Samoan man in the middle of Leicester, was particularly hard. ‘Discrimination was worse when I was in England,’ she admits. ‘When I met some people, I could tell by their body language that they rejected me. I could tell that, when I left, they would be talking behind my back. I don’t care. ‘I would always stand in the VIP queue at Life nightclub in Leicester. People would ask me why I would  stand in that line and I would answer, “Because I’m the VIP girl”.’ These days, Julie has returned to Samoa, where she and her parents live in a three-bedroomed home. Life is far easier in a Samoan culture where she is understood. ‘We have a big fa’afafine association here,’ says Julie. ‘We have a beauty pageant annually and we donate all the money to those who have special needs. Lots of my friends are fa’afafine, but I can be friends with anyone. ‘I am very happy as the kind of person I am.’ It is also surprisingly easy for Julie to buy clothes. ‘Most of the goods in Samoa are imported from America so they have sizes for fa’afafine. I’m size 16. I know how to maintain my body.’ Meanwhile, Manu has built his rugby reputation. He began playing with Rumney RFC’s youth team while living in Cardiff in 2004, after brother Freddie switched to the Cardiff Blues. At 15, Manu moved back to Leicester, winning a place at the Leicester Tigers academy, but after three years and on the verge of signing a professional contract, it was discovered that he had long overstayed his six-month tourist visa. The rest of his family were here legally, and local politicians and the local newspaper lobbied to keep Manu in the UK on the basis that he had the potential to play for England. He finally won indefinite leave to remain in July 2010 and in August 2011 made his England debut. He was later selected for England’s World Cup squad for the tournament in New Zealand. His decision to play for England, rather than Samoa, caused some controversy back in his homeland, but Julie is still incredibly proud. ‘Manu has made history. It’s a rare opportunity for any islander to play in the England team.’ In fact, Julie is proud of all her rugby-playing brothers. ‘When they play, they put all their heart and effort into it, with the talent that God gave them. When they come home, we live like a normal family. We joke, we play, we party, we go out. ‘My relationship with Manu and my brothers is fine. We enjoy being together and they respect me. ‘They buy me designer handbags on my birthday, like Chanel or Gucci. Manu got me a big box of cosmetics from Dior. He also gave me Dolce and Gabbana perfume and some handbags.’Julie will be watching when England play Ireland today in their Six Nations clash, and it is clear there are no hard feelings between Samoa and its famous son. ‘I am very excited about the Six Nations. We are all proud of Manu,’ Julie says. ‘All my relatives and the people of my village cheer for England because they know Manu is their flag-carrier. ‘We are all for England here when Manu’s playing.’","England rugby star's brother dresses as a woman called 'Julie' on the Samoan island of Savai'i .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has drawn a line under the ongoing debate over whether the club did enough to keep Steven Gerrard at the club. The Reds captain, whose move to the Los Angeles Galaxy this summer was confirmed on Wednesday, revealed earlier this week he would have signed a new contract had it been offered in pre-season. Liverpool's offer of an extended deal did not arrive until November, by which time the 34-year-old was already considering his future, and that has prompted questions about the club's handling of the affair.

"When David Beckham signed for LA Galaxy in 2007, the whole team was invited to a welcome party thrown by Will Smith and Tom Cruise. Stars grow on trees in Los Angeles and we were suddenly mingling with people like LeBron James at this glitzy event held for the Beckhams. At the time Galaxy wasn’t ready for a star like him to play for the club, but a lot has changed over the past few years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard: LA Galaxy told me what I wanted to hear . Signing Steven Gerrard is a 'dream scenario' for LA Galaxy, according to Kyle Martino . Gerrard will be playing in front of the 27,000 capacity StubHub Center next season . To sign Steven Gerrard is the dream scenario, one of the players Galaxy had on their wishlist when Landon Donovan announced that he would be retiring. It is a big, bold statement by MLS and particularly a team with LA Galaxy’s ambitions. Since Gerrard made the decision to move to LA he has had a number of telephone conversations with the president Chris Klein and the coach Bruce Arena. From what I hear they were very impressed by him. Steven is a leader, an iconic figure and to acquire a player of this quality and pedigree at this stage of his career is a pretty big deal for Galaxy. Gerrard has signed an initial 18-month contract with Galaxy, but Martino would like to see him stay even longer . Gerrard has set his sights on more silverware after sealing a move to Galaxy . His initial contract is for 18 months, but I would love to see him stay out here a bit longer because then he could play in the derby against the new franchise LAFC. The Merseyside derby against Everton is an iconic fixture that Gerrard has starred in over the years, and it would be something special to see him play for Galaxy against a rival team from the same city when they are up and running in 2017. In a few months’ time there is also a big lifestyle change coming for him and all the boys in the locker room will be lobbying him to live in their part of the city. I think Robbie Keane lives in downtown LA, you have the guys who live in Hollywood, Beverley Hills and those who choose to live by the ocean. I was talking to David the other day and we had a laugh because he said maybe Steven should just rent out his house! Gerrard will be hooking up again with former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Keane . Keane has been a big hit since his move to Galaxy in 2011 . He can live wherever he wants untroubled and stress free, taking his kids down to the ocean in the afternoons or to the park. I don’t think he will get the same attention with the paparazzi as Beckham. In many ways I felt for David because I really liked him and I saw a guy who just wanted to be normal and to play his football. He was humble and remains a good friend. There is a huge difference in the salaries of the players, but the Galaxy players will respect Gerrard for his achievements in the game and his status, They will play practical jokes just like any other. David Beckham was a sensation during his time in the MLS . Keane jokes with Beckham in training back in 2011 . At Galaxy, when Beckham and I were trying to get to the medical room first he taped up my locker while I was having treatment because I had got there first. I retaliated by putting super glue on the soles of his flip flops so that when he put his feet into them he would not be able to move. The poor guy nearly fell on the floor when he tried to walk. That is normal, usual stuff in any locker room and Gerrard will be made to feel part of it. He will make friends for life there. Yes the guy next to him could be earning $30,000 a year and he will be earning maybe $5m, but that same player will still invite him round to a BBQ with the rest of the players later that day. When Becks was with us he told me that at one of his clubs he didn't get invited to a team-mate’s house once. Galaxy is a different way of life and everybody mixes socially. Galaxy sold plenty of 'Beckham' shirts during his time at the club . The temperature is around 70-75 every day as well and he will be able to walk down the street in relative anonymity. People travel from all over to be in our backyard and Gerrard is going to live in one of the greatest cities in the world. The standard of Major League Soccer is better than the Europeans like to portray it, too. Gerrard will help raise the profile of it. There will be adaptations, such as the long distance travelling for games. That really did shock Beckham and Abel Xavier, the former Everton defender, when they signed for Galaxy. Kyle Martino insists Gerrard will love his time in LA . Some of the pitches are artificial too and Gerrard will have to get used to playing on them. I don’t think Beckham liked them. The Galaxy fans will love his commitment, passion and desire. It was very noticeable that he has spoken of winning trophies and that is good because Galaxy have won three titles in the last four years. They get around 28,000 at the StubHub Center and they are a passionate group of fans. At this stage of his career it is the perfect fit.

"Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has joked that the intense strengthening programme he was put on in his early days at the club left him feeling like 'Captain America'. De Gea underwent a brutal regime after joining United as a skinny 20-year-old and he was in the gym three mornings per week at 9.30am and also had extra afternoons sessions twice a week. 'I was like Captain America in one year (laughs)!' the keeper said in an interview with the club website. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal losing his rag over the future of David de Gea . David de Gea went through a rigorous strengthening regime following his move from Atletico Madrid (left) De Gea took some time to acclimatise himself to the Premier League, where strength as a goalkeeper is key . 'I still do the programme, although not as much as before. It is more of a reduced programme now but certainly I did a lot of gym work at the start and it did have a big impact.' De Gea has been in outstanding form this season and he also believes that his improving level of English has contributed to his performances. The Spaniard did study the language at school but struggled to communicate with fluency early on at United. He is now in a position where he is able to conduct interviews in English. 'I actually think the biggest impact is when you are in the dressing room. You need it on the field as well, of course, but you need it in the dressing room.

'I think the fact that I have started to do interviews in English has really helped as well, it has helped me to learn more of the language as well.' De Gea, whose United contract expires in 18 months' time, has thwarted opponents across the country in the first half of this campaign but he has warned that the best is still to come. He added: 'No matter how excellent your form is, you can always get better and there are always aspects of your game that you can improve. 'You can improve everything. No matter how well people think you are playing, or how well you think you are playing yourself, it is always a case of working on every facet of your game. There is hopefully more to come.'

"Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp enjoys the club's full backing, despite his team being in 17th place in the Bundesliga . The German club's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke reiterated on Wednesday they would never sack the 47-year-old. Dortmund, champions in 2011 and 2012, have been languishing in the bottom spots of the Bundesliga table after having lost 10 of their 17 matches in the first half of the season. Jurgen Klopp has again been backed by Borussia Dortmund, despite his dismal start to the season . The 2011 and 2012 champions Borussia Dortmund currently sit in a lowly 17th in the Bundesliga . 'We will never sack Jurgen Klopp,' Watzke told SportBild magazine. 'He has a lot of merits at the club. It will never come to a confrontational situation with him.' Watzke's comments echo those made following a crisis meeting with Klopp and sporting director Michael Zorc in December when he said: 'There are zero doubts. We are totally convinced of him. A few weeks ago he was praised into the skies, and the very same people now say that his time is over. I think that's just embarrassing.' Klopp, who took over in 2008 and also led them to the 2013 Champions League final, has suffered his worst first half to a season at Dortmund, Bundesliga runners-up in 2014.

"Rugby league has broken new ground by unveiling a major sponsorship deal with a firm of bookmakers. Ladbrokes have been announced by the Rugby Football League as the successors to Tetley's as sponsors of the Challenge Cup. Having weaned itself off a reliance on alcohol and tobacco sponsorship, the RFL took a principled stance three years ago in rejecting an offer from gambling firm Betfair for the naming rights to Super League in favour of a cashless deal with Stobart. Castleford Tigers celebrate at full time after their 2014 Challenge Cup semi-final win over Widnes Vikings . That decision was taken following a personal plea by then RFL executive chairman Richard Lewis but the current regime at Red Hall have adopted a more pragmatic stance since he left to take up the role of chief executive of the All England Club at Wimbledon in April 2012. Stobart were ditched after 12 months following pressure by the top-flight clubs and replaced as Super League sponsors by energy firm First Utility. Tetley's were appointed as Challenge Cup sponsors two years ago, taking over from long-time backers Carnegie, and now the RFL has struck a deal with Ladbrokes following the expiry of the agreement with the brewery. The deal is for three years and thought to be worth in excess of £1million a season. RFL commercial director Chris Rawlings said: 'I am delighted to announce a three-year partnership that will see the sport's oldest and most prestigious competition become the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup. Castleford's James Ellis crashes over for a try during his side's last four clash against Widnes . 'The Rugby League Challenge Cup is rich in heritage and tradition and it is both significant and fitting that the first Ladbrokes Challenge Cup final will be played on Founders Day.' Richard Glynn, chief executive of Ladbrokes, said: 'We're thrilled to begin our sponsorship of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup in a historic and momentous year for the sport. 'Rugby league is without doubt one of the world's most exciting sports, brimming with energy and adrenaline both on and off the pitch. 'The fans are beyond passionate and that passion is infectious and spreading quickly across the globe. This exclusive deal will bring Ladbrokes unprecedented access to the action, which all of our customers have become accustomed to as part of The Ladbrokes Life.' Forty amateur clubs, including representatives of the armed forces and the police, will go into the hat for the first-round draw at Wembley on Thursday and the 10 winning teams from the first two rounds will face Kingstone Press League 1 opposition in the third round in March. Kingstone Press Championship clubs will enter the fray in the fourth round while the bottom four teams from the 2014 Super League enter in round five in April, with the top eight clubs including holders Leeds joining at the last-16 stage in May.

"There were only 27,099 supporters there to see it but Barcelona's lowest crowd of the season watched them give one of their most ruthless displays beating La Liga's bottom club Elche 5-0 in the Copa del Rey. Jeers for Luis Enrique and cheers for Lionel Messi echoed around the 98,000 capacity arena early in the first half. The coach is still battling to save his job and he picked his strongest possible side with Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez reunited up front - all three scored in the first half to all but put Barca in the Cup quarter-finals where they will face Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid after the formality of next week's second leg. Many Barcelona supporters were left asking why tinkerman Luis Enrique had rested Gerard Pique, Dani Alves, Ivan Rakitic, Neymar and Messi in the previous Sunday's difficult trip to Real Sociedad to then play them all against lowly Elche who are currently the worst side in Spanish football. Click here for Pete Jenson's full match report . Host commentator . Neymar, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi proved to be too strong for La Liga strugglers Elche during the Copa del Rey clash at the Nou Camp. The home side got back to winning ways after losing to Real Sociedad by scoring five goals against their opponents. A double by Neymar and goals from Suarez, Messi and Alba ensured Barcelona pretty much guaranteed their place in the next round of the Copa del Rey, despite there being another 90 minutes of the two-legged tie. That's all from me, stay tuned to MailOnline for all the latest news in the world of sport. I told you he looked disappointed. Neymar was consoled by team-mate Adriano when leaving the pitch. Pedro goes close to making it 6-0. The Barcelona substitute tries to lob Tyton but his effort fails to hit the target. Tyton stretches down to his left to save a free-kick by Messi. The Elche goalkeeper has actually played OK despite conceding five goals. There's 10 minutes to go at the Nou Camp. Messi and Suarez remain on the pitch as Enrique elects to take off... a defender. Pique is replaced by Samper which results in Mascherano shifting to a more defensive position. Enrique may have decided to take off Neymar in order to protect the Brazilian from injury. He appeared to pick up a knock on his shin but was still unhappy at being denied the chance to grab a hat-trick. Neymar looked disappointed after coming off but Enrique is looking at the bigger picture. Atletico Madrid at home will be no easy challenge. Just ask Real Madrid. 18 minutes left here at the Nou Camp. Neymar is denied the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Enrique decides to replace the Brazilian with Pedro. Their defeat against Real Sociedad appears to be out of Barcelona's system. They are having fun out there on the Nou Camp turf. Barcelona don't appear to be easing off and Enrique is yet to take off any of his attacking players. Elche will want the referee to end the game now. Neymar gets his second with the goal of the match so far. He cuts inside before lashing the ball past the diving Tyton, who clutches at thin air. Messi unlocks Elche's defence once again with a delightful ball to Barcelona left back Jordi Alba. The Spain international scores by placing the ball through the legs of Tyton. Former Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure has just been named Africa's player of the year for a record fourth straight year. His former fans will be proud. Just 27,099 fans have attended today's game at the Nou Camp. Messi acknowledged the Barcelona crowd after scoring his side's third goal of the match. Barcelona face Atletico Madrid at the weekend, so Enrique may decide to rest the likes of Suarez and Neymar during the latter stages of this game. Enrique's side have had 11 shots at goal whereas Elche have had none. The home side scored their three goals in the space of 10 minutes. Elche will be pleased to get back into the dressing room as Barca were starting to move into second gear. Messi wouldn't have been content with his performance unless he got on the scoresheet. It was a blatant penalty on Neymar by Enzo Roco, who received a yellow card for the part he played in the incident. Barcelona found their stride in the closing stages of the first half with their key players all getting on the scoresheet. Neymar, Suarez and Messi are far too good for this Elche side. Messi adds a third just before half-time with a low penalty past Tyton. Barcelona have been awarded a penalty as Neymar has been taken down inside the area. Suarez follows up his assist for Neymar's open with a goal of his own. The former Liverpool forward jinks his way past Elche's defender before beating Tyton at the near post. Neymar puts his side in the lead by ending an outstanding Barcelona move. The Brazilian has the easy task of tapping the ball into an empty net after intricate play by Messi and Suarez. Enrique may choose to turn to Iniesta, pictured below, or Pedro during the second half if his side fails to unlock Elche's defence. Suarez has scored just three goals for Barcelona since joining the club in the summer. The Uruguayan will not be too pleased with his form at the club so far. Neymar latches on to a cross by Messi but his cross-cum-shot towards the fast post goes narrowly wide. Barca are starting to pile on the pressure with just under 30 minutes on the clock. Luis Enrique has failed to name the same starting line-up since taking over the reins at the Nou Camp. He has picked 26 different line-ups during his time at the club. Luis Suarez just blocked a goalwards shot by team-mate Ivan Rakitic. His time at the club really hasn't gone to plan since his move to the Nou Camp. Barcelona will be glad to get back on the football pitch after a hectic week at the Catalan giants. It is all change with Carles Puyol and sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta leaving the club. Will Luis Enrique be smiling at the end of tonight's match though? The resulting free-kick ended with Dani Alves going close to putting his side in the league. Tyton punched Messi's free-kick to the Brazilian defender who unleashed a ferocious shot which whistled past the post. Lionel Messi and Co. are finding it hard to break down Elche. However they do have a free-kick on the edge of Elche's box... Barcelona have won the Copa del Rey a record 26 times with their last triumph in the competition coming in the 2011-12 season. Luis Enrique will be hoping he can help his side add to their outstanding record. Lionel Messi jigs his way into a shooting position however his shot goes into the arms of Elche goalkeeper Tyton. Neymar and the Barcelona crowd make an appeal for a penalty but the referee waves away the protests. Elche will be pleased they haven't conceded after 10 minutes. Both Barcelona and Elche paid tribute to Fernando de Arcilla before the match at the Camp Nou. Elche are giving Barcelona's players the space and time to control the game. You get the feeling the likes of Rakitic and Neymar will enjoy tonight's game. Neymar and Luis Suarez link up to create the first real chance of the match but Elche's defence manage to stand firm. Their defence will face a tough task against Barca's attacking players. Just in case you missed it, former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes has signed an 18 month deal at Manchester United. Elche have struggled for form in La Liga this season, winning just two of of their 17 league games. They will be hoping for better luck in the Copa del Rey but will face a tough challenge at the Nou Camp. Elche starting line-up: Tyton, Damian, Roco, Lombán, Cisma, Herrera, Coro, Pelegrín, Faycal, Edu Albacar, Pasalic . Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has made eight changes to the side which were beaten 1-0 by David Moyes' Real Sociedad at the weekend. The likes of Lionel Messi, Dani Alves and Neymar have all returned to Barca's starting line-up for the Copa del Rey clash against Elche.

"If Cristiano Ronaldo has his way, and he so often does, this scene of the overwhelming favourite to win the Ballon d'Or relaxing by the pool on a luxury yacht off Dubai is the calm before the storm. Ronaldo had a remarkable 2014, even by the Portuguese superstar's standards, but he believes 2015 can be even better. 'It would be a dream if 2015 was like 2014 or even better,' Ronaldo said in an interview published in sports daily As on Saturday. Cristiano Ronaldo posted this image on Twitter from a yacht while enjoying a wintersun break in Dubai . 'Merry Christmas, everyone! May your Christmas be magic and your dreams come true!' Ronaldo posted on social media with his girlfriend Irina Shayk and his family on December 25 . Ronaldo shared this light-hearted moment after some face-painting with loved ones on Instagram . Ronaldo says, 'It would be a dream if 2015 was like 2014 or even better,' and that it is possible . Ronaldo told As in an interview published on Saturday that his goals for 2015 are lofty . A second Champions League was among Ronaldo's four titles and he scored an incredible 51 goals in 47 appearances, setting a record of 17 goals for one edition of of Europe's elite club competition along the way as Real secured a record-extending 10th continental crown and the King's Cup. Since August 2014 he's amassed 34 goals in 27 matches in all competitions, with 25 of those in 14 La Liga matches a Spanish record that puts him on course to smash Lionel Messi's benchmark of 50 in the Spanish domestic competition in 2011-12. But no, in Ronaldo's world - which at the moment means soaking up sunshine  in the Middle East during La Liga's winter break - there is room for improvement. And it's an achievable goal, he says. 'It is possible to do it because Madrid is always a candidate to win the competitions it is playing in,' added the 29-year-old. 'We have a team spirit that can help us win the most titles possible and we will fight to the death to get them.' Ronaldo attributed much of Real's recent success to the arrival of coach Carlo Ancelotti, who replaced the divisive Jose Mourinho at the end of the 2012-13 season. Ronaldo poses with his family in front of a new statue of himself in his hometown of Funchal in Madeira . Ronaldo (left) poses with Sergio Ramos after Real Madrid won the FIFA Club World Cup Final . The forward kisses his third Golden Boot award for being the premier European scorer in 2014 . Italian Ancelotti immediately ended Real's 12-year wait for their 10th European title and using the club's millions has built a formidable side that is top of La Liga and one of the favourites to repeat their Champions League success this term. 'The coach has a lot of importance,' Ronaldo told As. 'He is a great trainer and a great person and we are all delighted with him. 'Together we are a united family which will try to improve on the successes of 2014.' Ronaldo will find out whether he has won a third FIFA World Player of the Year award, and his second in a row, on January 12 when he is up against Argentina captain Messi and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.

"In school playgrounds across the Black Country this week, a new fad may briefly emerge. When the imaginary goal line between the jumpers is breached at lunchtime, there may be the temptation to do a 'Berahino'. Teenagers, come to think of it, should find it particularly easy. You may even say the pouting sulk, the refusal to smile, will come naturally to the majority of West Brom supporters aged between, say, 12 and 15. Ian Hodgson's pictures from the Hawthorns looked like Saido Berahino was ready to go home with the ball . The West Bromwich Albion man scored four goals against Gateshead in the FA Cup third round on Saturday . Unfortunately for Saido Berahino himself, however, he is likely to find that this is a phase, unlike adolescence itself, that doesn't actually last very long. Even the most ardent teenage football supporter knows that fake misery may look good on the disco dance floor but on the football field it just looks a little, well, fake. The joy of football is to be found in scoring goals. It is the purpose of the game. In football, happy will always trump sad and if you are unable to look pleased when you score then it won't be long until people start to wonder if there is just something rather wrong with you. This is the predicament young Berahino finds himself in today. Berahino's fourth signalled West Brom's seventh against Gateshead, easing them through to the fourth round . Despite scoring four of his side's seven goals, Berahino did not crack a smile during the game on Saturday . At the start of a transfer window that at one stage looked likely to feature a clutch of high-profile enquiries about his availability, the 21-year-old is beginning to attract attention for the kind of reasons that have a habit of sending burgeoning careers in to a rather dramatic reverse. For those without access to televisions, radios, newspapers or the internet, it is worth pointing out here that Berahino scored four times for West Brom in the FA Cup on Saturday but failed to crack anything resembling a smile at any point. In one of the terrific Ian Hodsgon photographs carried in these pages on Monday, the centre forward actually looks as though he is, quite literally, about to take his ball home. By all accounts, a young player gifted enough to be called up by England earlier this season is upset that talk of a new contract at the Hawthorns has faded. He remains, much to his chagrin, on a deal that pays him in the region of £12,000-a-week, low in modern terms. Eric Cantona was the master of the moody celebration for Manchester United, but he was different . Cantona affected an air of gladiatorial indifference when he scored a goal for Manchester United . He may also be upset at the fact he is facing a drink driving charge serious enough to carry a threat of a six-month prison sentence. Whether he has yet made the connection between fact one – the contract slow down - and fact two – the subsequent criminal charge – only he will know. Whatever the case, when he was placed in front of reporters on Saturday evening to talk about his impressive feats on the field, he did offer an explanation regarding his apparent lack of enjoyment and job satisfaction. 'I was just handling business and acting professionally and that's it,' he said. 'I just didn't want to celebrate and that was it.' Berahino is within his rights to mark the scoring of a goal in any way he sees fit, of course. No footballer's contract contains a 'smile' clause and maybe he is dealing with an issue personal to him that we don't know about. Mario Balotelli is another footballer who has celebrated with nonchalantly after scoring a goal . Balotelli (left) and Nicolas Anelka (right) have carried the same look while playing for their clubs . However, he must be careful not confuse carrying a face liked a slapped backside around a football field with professionalism for they are not the same. Sadly for him, managers at other clubs admiring of his undoubted talents will know this and will now look at his name and recognise the rather worrying signs of a flashing red light. There have been other players over the years who have trodden this solemn, joyless path, of course. Mario Balotelli tried it at Manchester City but he just looked stupid, largely because he couldn't even do it properly. It's hard to look moody and interesting when the corners of your mouth are beginning to twitch upwards. Farther back there was Nicolas Anelka and, of course, Eric Cantona. King Eric was brilliantly, undeniably, different, though. Berahino looks glum as he celebrates alongside team-mates Craig Dawson (left) and Chris Baird (right) England international Berahino's shot hits the back of the net to put West Brom 7-0 up in the FA Cup . The Frenchman affected an air of gladiatorial indifference when he scored, as though he found the whole thing rather beneath him, a little too easy. In its own, strange way, there was joy to be found in that and the crucial difference here is that the whole routine made Manchester United supporters like him a whole lot more, not less. As for the rest of the country, he simply didn't care. Cantona also had the benefit of being a recognised world star, a phenomenon. He was weird but you could argue that he had earned the right to be. Berahino is still at the start of his own journey and it is to be hoped he doesn't ruin it. It would be a shame, for him and for England, if he did. Back in the playgrounds of the West Midlands, he may indeed have a new fan club for the moment, a group that feels the best way to celebrate is by not celebrating. It won't last, though. Not in the long term. One wonders whether Berahino will.","Saido Berahino scored four as West Brom beat Gateshead 7-0 in FA Cup .

Chaton was criticised by Chivas fans on Social media who said he should be focusing on improving his poor form on the pitch, rather than exposing his personal life online . Nestor del la Torre, president of Chivas, said he was shocked by the pictures, adding that they were too inappropriate to be posted by a member of his club. He said the team were considering disciplining the 24-year-old player, who has played for Mexico eight times, by fining him or dropping him from the squad. Chaton was also criticised by Chivas fans on social media, who said the player should be focusing on improving his poor form on the pitch, rather than exposing his personal life online. The image of him and girlfriend Gladys Castellanos, 24, was posted by the player with the message 'I love you'. Miss Castellanos responded to the fans' outrage, posting on social media that she loves Chaton and that nothing had made her happier than the relationship they have been in since last summer. Miss Castellanos, 24, defended her boyfriend and said the raunchy picture was not of them . Chivas are considering disciplining Chaton by fining him or dropping him from the squad . She insisted on Twitter that the photograph did not actually show them and said it was unfair that the footballer had been slammed over it. The TV presenter said: 'It is easy to act and make comments without knowing the truth. 'Yes this photo has attracted a huge amount of interest but me and Chaton are not in the photo.' It is not the first time that the footballer's private life has caused controversy. A fling between him and Playboy model Leia Freitas cost him his relationship with former girlfriend Maria Teresa Gover, who he had been with for four years.","Jorge 'Chaton' Enriquez posted a racy picture of him and girlfriend online .

"Richie Benaud has put his dulcet tones to good use, inviting icons past and present to an Australia Day lamb barbecue at his house. The voice of Australian cricket calls on the likes of Captain Cook, Ned Kelly and Don Bradman to join him for a knees up at his waterfront home as part of a campaign for Meat and Livestock Australia. The 84-year-old has not returned to the microphone at the Nine Network's cricket commentary team this summer as he continues to battle skin cancer. Scroll down for video . Iconic cricket commentator Richie Benaud has joined the annual campaign to promote lamb on Australia Day . Benaud calls Captain Cook (left) and AFL star Sam Kekovich (right) round to his place for a lamb BBQ . Benaud later looks worried when legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (left) offers to 'round up the guys' for the barbie, while Billy Birmingham (right) hinted for an invite but was told there was no barbecue by Richie - the cricket legend clearly still bitter about Birmingham's portrayal of him as character, The Twelfth Man . Journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose (left) was more than happy to accept the invite from the back of her limousine, and explorers Burke (pictured bottom, in right side image) and Wills (pictured top, in right side image) agreed to attend from what looks like the Aussie outback . But the national treasure has taken on a new role in the annual Australia Day lamb campaign - capturing the spirits by doing what we believe every Aussies should be doing - organising a big lamb BBQ and a game of backyard cricket. Benaud has joined with 'Lambassador' Sam Kekovich as well as a host of national and historical icons to join him in bringing everyone together to share the most-loved chops and cutlets. The advertisement opens on an open sea, with Captain Cook aboard his ship as he approaches the Australian shore line. His steely focus on the path ahead is interrupted by a phone call from Benaud inviting him to a 'barbie' at his place on Australia Day. 'Cooky' agrees, and asks if fellow explorers Burke and Wills are also on the guest list – they're keen, despite their death-bed-dire situation in a baking hot desert. Benaud later looks worried when legendary outlaw Ned Kelly offers to 'round up the guys' for the occasion, although this is less worrying than the rumour that Kelly has gone 'veggo' (in fact he is just gluten intolerant). Other iconic Australians invited to Benaud's barbie include iconic cricketer Don Bradman, media giant Ita Buttrose, and of course Sam Kekovich. Benaud captures the spirit by doing what every Aussies should be doing - organising a big lamb BBQ . Lamb-lovers can also score a once in a lifetime opportunity to spend their Australia Day with Richie Benaud himself. Ten Aussies (and two of their mates) are being given the opportunity to attend a BBQ to meet Benaud. To secure this exclusive invite people simply have to upload an impersonation of Benaud's lamb BBQ call 'Top Lamb Chop That!' to the We Love Our Lamb Facebook page. But when Billy Birmingham – famous for impersonating Benaud as the 12th Man – gets wind of the lamb feast, he's bluntly told by Benaud that there's nothing on. Benaud said: 'In addition to my love of cricket on Australia Day, I wanted to be involved in another key part of our national day, the iconic lamb campaign. 'For me, this year's campaign encapsulates what Australia Day is all about; Australians getting together for a lamb BBQ.' General Manager Global Marketing at Meat & Livestock Australia Michael Edmonds said: 'As a nation we love our lamb, and it's our belief that you never lamb alone. 'That goes double on Australia Day. Benaud might not be at the cricket surrounded by his army of fans this year, but he's still making the most of the day and spending it with this pantheon of notable Australians.'

"Alex Neil will have further talks with Norwich over their managerial vacancy after Hamilton agreed a compensation deal with the Norfolk club. Accies vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald agreed a deal from New Douglas Park on Thursday afternoon and Neil will return to Norwich to finalise his appointment. MacDonald said at an impromptu media conference: 'I'm happy to report that we have now agreed compensation terms with Norwich City. A most amicable arangement eventually broke out. And I'm delighted Alex has now got the opportunity to go and discuss terms with them.' Alex Neil is set to take charge at Norwich after having talks with the club on Wednesday . Neil Adams resigned on Monday after less than nine months in charge of the Championship club . Norwich have been quick to pinpoint Neil as a replacement for Neil Adams, who quit following their weekend FA Cup defeat by Preston, and with his team sitting just outside the promotion play-off places. The mood of the Hamilton players was decidedly downbeat when they emerged from the meeting with their manager and team-mate, who captained the club before taking over from Billy Reid little over 18 months ago. Defender Mikey Devlin admitted 'it looks like' Neil was moving on. The Hamilton manager, pictured during training on Monday, is set to be installed by Friday . The 21-year-old said: 'Everybody is a bit flat and a bit disappointed. He has been an inspirational figure for everybody at the club and everybody had a great relationship with him. Everybody loved him here. 'So we are disappointed but at the same time thrilled for him because he deserves it. 'Everybody is delighted for him that he has got an opportunity to go and manage at a higher level. We all hope he goes on and shows how good he can be.' Neil led the club to promotion in his first full season as manager, while they are now on course for their best-ever campaign in the top flight. Neil will leave his role as player manager at Hamilton, the club where he has been for nearly 10 years . Accies topped the Scottish Premiership after a 1-0 win at Celtic Park in October - their first victory at Parkhead for 76 years - and they have scored nine goals without reply in two league games against Lanarkshire rivals Motherwell. They currently sit third in the table, four points behind leaders Aberdeen. Speaking on Wednesday, vice-chairman Ronnie Macdonald said: 'We are delighted that Alex's achievements have been recognised by this approach and that our policy of progressing players, staff and managers continues.'","Alex Neil will have further talks with Norwich over their managerial vacancy .

"Peugeot 2008 Hybrid Air . On sale: from 2016 . Price: circa £16,000This week I became the first British journalist — and one of the very first in the world — to road-test the radical new family car that drives on air: the Peugeot 2008 Hybrid Air, developed by PSA Peugeot-Citroen and German electronics giant Bosch. I took it on an adventurous spin on frenetically busy roads around the heart of Paris, past landmarks such as the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe. It has a conventional, but frugal threecylinder 1.2 litre petrol engine linked to a hydraulic air-motor and pump plus a hightech automatic electronic gear system. Exclusive first drive: Ray Massey was the first British journalist to test drive the Peugeot 2008 Hybrid Air . Driving feels a little different to a conventional automatic car. It's nimble. A visual display on the dashboard screen tells you when you are in zero pollution or petrol mode. It chugs happily along in town running only on air. It certianly didn't run out of puff and giving the accelerator a quick burst — vital on Parisian roads to keep you out of trouble — meant the combined force of the 82bhp petrol engine and the 40bhp air motor kicked in together to put wind in its sails. Economy is an impressive 94 mpg. The engineers' aim is for a car that will return 140mpg. On sale from 2016 with a lessthan-inflated price tag of around £16,000. The sports utility vehicle will be the first of a new generation of Peugeots and Citroens running on air and follows earlier experiments on smaller Citroen C3s. Air power: The sports utility vehicle will be the first of a new generation of Peugeots and Citroens running on air . And we're off! The car's top speed is 108mph and it will go from rest to 62mph in around 10 seconds . The revolutionary new engine system is the first to combine conventional petrol power with compressed air — operating in tandem like a bicycle pump and a balloon. Top speed is 108mph and it will go from rest to 62mph in around 10 seconds. Average CO2 emissions are exceptionally low at 69g/km and it has a range of about 850 miles. In 'air' mode, zero-emissions driving is possible for 80 per cent of the time, with no fuel consumption. Predicted to cut fuel bills around town by 45 per cent and overall by more than a third (35 per cent). The air tank is underneath the car and air is repeatedly compressed using energy retrieved from the petrol engine, moving wheels and during braking. Seeing the sights: Ray took the air car for a test drive through the heart of Paris . Air power — for lower-speed driving in cities — is automatically activated below 43mph. Combined or 'hybrid' mode is best for high-power acceleration or hill climbing. Petrol power is best for long-distance cruising. It doesn't look wacky. From the outside it's identical to a conventional vehicle because the revolutionary system can be used on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size. Cars fitted with Hybrid Air will be about £1,000 cheaper than current electric-hybrid models, say PSA Peugeot Citroen officials. Motorists won't run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road, because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically — compressing and decompressing of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down. Behind the wheel: A stripped-back look at the new hybrid. Motorists will be able to use zero-emissions air power for lower-speed driving. The feature is activated automatically when the car is doing under 43mph . The car of the future: The air powered car will be on sale from 2016, for circa £16,000 . A curious clackety hiss and hum of the air pump when in zeroemissions mode. Not the best start when the car suffered an initial technical 'glitch' and came to an embarrassing halt — with me at the wheel. Still a few rough edges to iron out but surely the finished, showroom version will be smoother.","The Peugeot 2008 Hybrid Air runs on nothing more than air .

"Dover Athletic chairman Jim Parmenter has slammed Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew for being 'rude and arrogant' following the Eagles' 4-0 FA Cup win at Crabble on Sunday afternoon. Pardew took charge of the south London side for the first time as they secured a comprehensive victory at the home of the Conference opposition, but the 53-year-old left a bitter taste in the mouths of Dover. The Palace boss was believed to be incensed at the accessibility to the ground, with Pardew claiming it took his side 20 minutes to walk 150 yards up the Crabble slope from the coach drop-off point in Lewisham Road.

"A five-month-old baby who never woke up from his afternoon nap had enterovirus, it has emerged. Lancen Kendall was pronounced brain dead and passed away five days after he was put down for a nap in his Phoenix, Arizona home earlier this month. Doctors initially told his devastated parents that he had succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but they have since confirmed that he also had enterovirus. They are still waiting to find out whether he had enterovirus 68, the particular strain that has claimed at least two other children's lives and has been diagnosed in nearly 700 people across the U.S. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Lancen Kendall passed away earlier this month, five days after he failed to wake up from a nap . Kevin  Kendall told Fox10 how he put his son down for a nap and was horrified when he saw him turning blue, particularly because the youngster had shown no symptoms and had not cried. 'I checked on him halfway through his nap, for him not to be breathing an hour and a half later, it's a terrifying ordeal,' he told the channel. 'It was a very scary moment.' The youngster was rushed to Banner Thunderbird Medical Center. Doctors found a pulse but declared him brain dead, and he passed away five days later. The couple, who have older sons, said doctors told them it was SIDS but a few days later they said there also seemed to be more to his death. Doctors said he had tested positive for enterovirus and are now trying to determine the strain. The parents said they had never even heard of the illness and have no idea how the little boy would have contracted it. Heartbroken: His parents, Kevin and Kathleen Kendall, pictured, said doctors told them the little boy had enterorvirus. They said the youngster had shown no symptoms of the respiratory illness . Scene: They put the boy down for a nap and an hour later, he was turning blue and not breathing . Loss: The boy was rushed to hospital but was declared brain dead and he passed away five days later . 'The only thing that can come good out of this now is just to get it out there and let people know this is happening,' his mother Kathleen said. 'Our baby didn't show any symptoms and it was terrifying.' His father Kevin added to 3TV: 'The lack of warning is the scariest part to me. We didn't know he was sick.' 3TV reported that he is one of 24 recent enterovirus cases across the state. At least two other U.S. children have been killed by the virus. Madeline Reid, from Detroit, Michigan, was paralyzed by the illness and was put on life support on September 14. The 21-month-old girl died last week. Her death followed that of four-year-old Eli Waller, from Hamilton, New Jersey, who passed away on September 25 after failing to wake up after a night's sleep. The virus, which displays flu-like symptoms, has also been linked to other deaths, including that of 10-year-old Emily Otrando, from Rhode Island, who died on September 22. Widespread: 700 people have been diagnosed with the virus. A map from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows how cases changed within states in the week October 5 to October 11 . Taken: 21-month-old Madeline Reid, left, and four-year-old Eli Waller, right, have both died from the virus . In total, 691 people have been affected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The majority of the cases are believed to be children. Only Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and Alaska have not seen any cases. This week, the CDC said that 32 states and the District of Columbia have reported low or declining incidents of the illness, while 12 states reporting increasing or elevated activity. The illness, which has flu and cold-like symptoms, causes severe respiratory illness and can lead to difficulty breathing in infants and young children, officials have said. Children under age five who have asthma or other respiratory problems seem to be especially susceptible. Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual and peak usually in September into fall. They usually resemble a bad cold, but this particular strain has become worrisome for parents across the US after a number of fatalities among children . What is proving so worrisome about this particular strain? ED-D68 was first identified in the 1960s and is uncommon, but has been cropping up in recent years in Georgia, Pennsylvania and abroad in Japan and the Netherlands. However, the bottom line is that experts cannot explain why it is has flared so dramatically this year. They also cannot explain why it is proving so virulent. Signs and symptoms . ED-D68 begins as a cold, with coughing, fever and wheezing. The virus can cause breathing difficulties but most recover well after a week. How serious is it? While experts have said that in theory some cases can become so severe they result in death, many of the EV-D68 infections 'will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,' according to the Missouri health agency said. How can infection be prevented? This particular enterovirus is spread through bodily contact. Making children far more susceptible. Health officials have said there is not much that can be done about it other than washing hands with soap and disinfecting surfaces. There's no vaccine for EV-D68 .

"A first grader in Arizona has died of a respiratory disease that parents fear could be the deadly Enterovirus. Public health officials are awaiting the results of tests to determine what disease killed the Vistancia Elementary School student, but dozens of parents aren't taking any chances and pulled their children from school as soon as they learned of the illness.

Children under age 5 who have asthma or other respiratory problems seem to be especially susceptible. Scroll down for video . Concerned: Parents lined up at Vistancia Elementary School to pull their children from class after a report of upper respiratory illness in a first grader. The student later died . Enterovirus cases have been confirmed in at least 20 states and three Canadian provinces, though this would be the case to be diagnosed in Arizona. There is no cure or treatment for the virus - doctors are left to care for the symptoms and hope it runs its course in a few days. Enterovirus cases have been confirmed in nearly every state in the country . The virus is spread through saliva and phlegm, similar to the cold and flu viruses. The child fell ill over the weekend and was quickly hospitalized with a respiratory illness. Health officials say they do not yet know what sickened the child. Administrators at the school in Peoria, outside Phoenix, declined to close the school after the child's death was announced Tuesday.

Several parents said the planned to keep their children home from school on Wednesday. 'Better safe than sorry,' one parent told the TV station.

The disease can spread through droplets in coughs or sneezes or when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as a countertop or doorknob, it is reported. There is no vaccine or specific treatment. As of Tuesday, 31 cases in Michigan had tested positive for enterovirus D68, according to Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Community Health.

"She might have been 'exquisitely beautiful' but according to former James Bond star Roger Moore, 86, Zsa Zsa Gabor was a little broad in the beam. This observation, along with many others, appears in the Hollywood veteran's new memoir, Last Man Standing: Tales From Tinseltown. Here Moore reveals what he really thinks about his leading ladies, among them Bette Davis, Grace Kelly and Joan Collins - and not all of it's good. Dapper gent: Roger Moore, who has played James Bond more times than any other, has written a new memoir . ZSA ZSA GABOR . Zsa Zsa Gabor is perhaps better known for the number of her marriages rather than anything else, and I was once coupled with her by MGM - albeit platonically. It was the studio's habit of partnering their contract artists with each other to attend events, premieres and dinners, purely for publicity purposes. I accompanied Zsa Zsa to one such premier and on to dinner afterwards. She was exquisitely beautiful, if a little large in the lower rear region I felt - well, not literally felt, you understand. At one point, Zsa Zsa was married to George Sanders, he was husband number three of nine I think, but she was also having an affair with Rubirosa (aka Mr Ever Ready). Exquisitely beautiful but a little large in the rear area: Roger's verdict on actress Zsa Zsa Gabor . Caught out: One of Moore's favourite stories is the tale of Gabor being caught with Porfiro Rubirosa (pictured) Porfirio Rubirosa was a Dominican diplomat whose reputation as a playboy far exceeded any political accomplishments and was only matched by stories of his sexual prowess. George was obviously aware of something going on between his wife and the playboy and returned home one day, just before Christmas, propped a ladder against the bedroom window and caught the pair mid-service. The ensuing flash of a camera bulb quite put Rubirosa off his stroke and there was a mad scramble out of bed as George gently descended the ladder, and let himself in through the front door to wait at the foot of the stairs. Zsa Zsa and Rubirosa sheepishly descended. 'Merry Christmas Zsa Zsa... and to you Rubi,' he said in his deliciously wonderful sardonic voice before leaving. They divorced the following April and Rubirosa continued his womanising ways elsewhere. Good friend: Grace Kelly is remembered for her witty conversation and remained a friend after her marriage . GRACE KELLY . I found myself seated next to Grace at dinner one evening at Hollywood hairdresser Sydney Guilaroff's house. The conversation started turning to politics, of which, as a young Brit, I knew very little, and Grace said to me, 'You know Roosevelt sold us down the river'. I'm afraid I had no idea what she was talking about and for some time after that, often kicked myself for being unable to continue the conversation. Some years later, when I became a regular visitor to the South of France and she had become Princess Grace of Monaco, she invited me up to the Grimaldi family's farm retreat, Roccagele, in the hills high above Monte Carlo and that's where I first met Prince Albert who I guess was 11 or 12. Family friend: Moore first met Prince Albert of Monaco when he was aged 11 or 12 at the Grimaldi family farm . He struck me as being a very quiet and shy young man, who took great pleasure in showing me the many animals around the farm. Grace wasn't at all stuffy as her royal status would have entitled her to be had she wished. Far from it, she had a mischievous sense of humour, a glint of naughtiness in her eye - especially saucy ones. Grace was a very precious gift to Monaco, albeit for too short a time. AVA GARDNER . Ava was a very funny and pithy lady, though was, perhaps, equally well known for her sexual conquests and husbands as much as her films. She was married three times in all, to Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra; and her high profile affairs included those with Clarke Gable, Robert Taylor, George C. Scott and Robert Mitchum. Scandalous: Actress Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra's scandalous marriage was the source of much gossip . In fact, legend has it that while filming My Forbidden Past in 1951, that she was first attracted to co-star Mitchum, who was himself under contract to Howard Hughes, with whom Ava had been romantically linked. Mitchum telephoned his boss. 'Do you mind if I go to bed with Ava?' he asked. 'If you don't,' Hughes replied, 'they'll think you're a pansy'. BETTE DAVIS . Towards the end of my tenure as Simon Templar at ABPC Studios in Borehamwood in 1968, Hammer Films moved in on an adjacent stage with a film version of the hit West End play, The Anniversary. It starred Hollywood grande dame Bette Davis along with Sheila Hancock and James Cossins in support. A very talented, award-winning young . director named Alvin Rakoff was signed to helm this new Hammer . production, and the British cast were told that Miss Davis was to . command their utmost respect, but they were not to approach her directly . on set. Challenging: Bette Davis liked to get her own way and had those who annoyed her sacked from their jobs . Diva: Bette Davis (pictured right) with Sheila Hancock was a director's nightmare on the set of The Anniversary . Furthermore, on her first day, they were given instructions to gather round and applaud the star as she made her entrance. Within a few days it was clear that Bette was not only standoffish with her co-stars but was even unwilling to engage in any form of dialogue with Alvin, . 'She was above taking or talking about direction of any kind,' he said. She had the producers fire Alvin, very unceremoniously, after a week and hired in Roy Ward Baker to replace him. Shortly after, the Director of Photography was fired after Miss Davis accused him of not lighting her properly, and she subsequently gave her own specific instructions on where lights should be placed. Sheila Hancock had the dressing room next door to Miss Davis' and she was able to hear the conversations through the radiator pipes and - almost on a daily basis - heard whom Miss Davis demanded to be sacked next. LANA TURNER . Another wonderful actress and feisty lady was Lana Turner. I wrote about Lana in my autobiography, about the time in the early 1950s when she taught me how to kiss on the set of the movie Diane. I actually thought my technique was pretty good - I had already been married twice and hadn't had many complaints in that department - but Lana taught me a new technique of 'passion without pressure' - what a lady she was! Of course, when she came to make Diane, Lana was already a huge Hollywood star with lots of classic films to her name - not to mention several husbands and lovers. Lesson: According to Moore, 'real lady' Lana Turner taught him how to kiss on the set of Diane in 1956 . However, I will also remember her for the day she told our producer on the film, Edwin Knopf, to 'fuck off', after a seemingly trivial difference of opinion on set. In fact, Eddie was so upset, he stormed directly off stage and into my trailer, where he was sitting, pink-eyed, when I returned a short while later. 'I've known Lana since she first walked onto this lot as a young girl,' he said to me. 'And now she speaks to me like that, in front of the whole cast and crew!' I returned to the set and asked Lana why she'd been so rotten to Eddie who was, as everyone who knew him will attest, a lovely guy. He'd also overcome disability, leaving him with only one arm, which endeared him to everyone even more. 'Sweetheart,' she replied matter-of-factly. 'When I first came on this set, all the producers fucked me. So now I'm fucking them.' Good friends: Roger Moore, his ex-wife Luisa Mattioli and Joan Collins (centre) enjoy a day at the races . JOAN COLLINS . One night, Joan was late for a ball in Hollywood which she was attending with Arthur [Loew Jr]. Arthur had been brooding about her punctuality for some time, and this time, he snapped, 'You are f***ing boring'. 'And you are a boring f***,' snapped Joan, without a blink. Joan has a lovely turn of phrase, as does her sister Jackie. Their father, Joe Collins, was a big theatrical agent in the 1950s and was, in fact, my wife Dorothy Squires' agent, and I got to know him well. Witty: Joan Collins has a way with words and refused to let anything stand in the way of her marriages . He was a very dashing, handsome man-about-town and Elsa, his wife, was a very graceful, classically beautiful woman who believed implicitly in Joan's innocence. When Joan announced to Elsa that she wanted to marry Maxwell Reed, the man to whom she'd lost her virginity, Elsa said, 'Darling, he's an actor - and a spivvy sort of actor at that. But Daddy won't allow that.' 'Then I will live with him,' Joan replied, with a flourish. Elsa told me she never doubted it and that's why they agreed to the marriage.

"Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer insists Alan Pardew was right to call time on his St James' Park career in favour of a move to Crystal Palace. Pardew won his first game in charge of the Eagles against Conference side Dover on Sunday after bringing an end to his four-year spell on Tyneside. The 53-year-old's decision to move to south London was questioned in some quarters but Shearer believes Pardew has plenty of good reasons for choosing a return to Selhurst Park. Alan Pardew gestures towards Crystal Palace's travelling fans after beating Dover in his first game in charge . Palace defender Scott Dann heads home his side's second goal against their Conference opponents . In an interview with the BBC, Toon legend Shearer said: 'It did make me laugh when I heard people saying that Alan wouldn't leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace. 'There's a million reasons why Alan would leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace – he'd be on a better salary at a football club where the fans would want him, he would buy and sell the players he wanted.

Pardew was on a long-term contract at St James' Park but Shearer, who is the Magpies' top scorer of all time, thinks that owner Mike Ashley may have had a say in his departure. Asked about Ashley's intentions for Newcastle, Shearer said: 'I don't know (what they are) because he never tells us anything.

"Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard ended speculation about his future after agreeing an 18-month deal with LA Galaxy on Wednesday. The midfielder will move to the US in July when his contract at Anfield expires. Here's all you need to know about the MLS outfit. Steven Gerrard wants more silverware after sealing a move to Galaxy... but what can he expect in LA? WHAT’S THEIR HISTORY? The MLS was founded as part of the USA’s bid to host the 1994 World Cup and LA Galaxy were one of the 10 founding teams in its inaugural season in 1996. As for the name, that comes from the galaxy of stars in Hollywood and Los Angeles. David Beckham helped Galaxy to the MLS Cup in 2012 and poses with his kids and the trophy . ARE THEY ANY GOOD? They are the most decorated side in MLS history. They have won the MLS Cup — the play-off final between the eastern and western conferences — five times and are one of just two MLS sides to win the CONCACAF Champions’ Cup (now Champions League), the North and Central American equivalent of the UEFA Champions League. WHO’S PLAYED FOR THEM? David Beckham is their most famous player but they have not had many other stars. Robbie Keane is the club vice-captain while Carlo Cudicini, Juan Pablo Angel and Abel Xavier had brief stints. Landon Donovan is the most notable homegrown talent. Robbie Keane and Beckham have both worn Galaxy colours . Beckham was a sensation during his time in the MLS with Galaxy . WHO’S THE BOSS? Bruce Arena has been in charge since 2008 and was previously the US national team’s most successful coach, leading them to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002. Ruud Gullit was briefly Galaxy coach in 2007-08. Gerrard will be playing under former US coach Bruce Arena at Galaxy . WHAT’S THE GROUND LIKE? The StubHub Center is a 27,000 all-seat stadium just south of downtown LA. The American national team often play there and it hosts the US leg of the IRB Rugby Sevens World Series. The site also includes a velodrome, a tennis stadium and a track and field arena.

"As dream starts go they didn't come any more perfect than Andy Fenn's. It was February, the season was just beginning, and on the Mediterranean island of Majorca the 21-year-old Scot sprinted in at the head of a star-studded field to win the Trofeo Palma. Next day, Fenn did it again. Two outings in the colours of his new team, Omega Pharma-QuickStep, and two victories. And among those watching from the sidelines, and kicking himself, was Dave Brailsford. Andrew Fenn celebrates victory in Mallorca as he crosses the finish line for Omega-Pharma QuickStep . Dave Brailsford watched Fenn win his first two races in Majorca for Omega . But Fenn has since failed to hit the heights of Sir Bradley Wiggins (left) and Mark Cavendish (right) Fenn pictured in action in Switzerland for Great Britain in the men's under 23 time trial in 2009 . Brailsford wondered whether, by not signing Fenn for Team Sky, he had made a mistake that would come back to haunt him. Because on that February day in Palma it really did seem that Fenn might be the latest world beater to come off the British production line, after Bradley Wiggins, Mark Cavendish and Geraint Thomas. That was 2011 and since then Fenn's career has faltered. Which is why he is grateful to finally get his chance with Sky, becoming the first Scot to sign with the British team in a bid to reboot his career and prove those wins in Majorca were no fluke. It's a move Fenn has been trying to engineer for almost a year. As he explains: 'I said to myself at the start of last season that if I don't break into the Classics team at QuickStep then I want to go somewhere I can at least ride those races. 'I was pushing to move to Sky from early on in the season, so it's a nice feeling to be there now. I know some of the people from British Cycling, but not all of them. So it's a new environment for me.' At 24, Fenn is still young, but he admits 2014 was frustrating. His year could be summed up by a damp and cold Commonwealth Games road race, where he represented Scotland – although he was born in Hertfordshire and brought up in the Midlands, his mother and her family are all from Glasgow. In conditions that forced flights to be diverted from Glasgow Airport, Fenn cut a bedraggled figure as he abandoned the race long before Geraint Thomas appeared on the finishing straight, arms aloft in victory. 'I had a really bad day,' Fenn says now. 'It was terrible.' Fenn had a terrible time at the Commonwealth Games road race in Glasgow, which Geraint Thomas won . Fenn (centre) could not replicate the podium success enjoyed in Majorca during the Commonwealth Games . It was certainly a long way from Majorca in February, 2011. Yet when Fenn joined QuickStep, the Belgian super-squad, it seemed the perfect union. He is a big, powerful rider, with the potential to be a star of one-day Classics such as the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix – races dominated by his then new team. But the all-round strength of the squad – with riders such as Tom Boonen, as well as Cavendish and the new world champion, Michal Kwiatkowski – made it hard for a young, British rider to break through – particularly one as quiet as the unassuming Fenn. 'I always knew it was going to be difficult because they've got such a strong group of Classics riders,' says Fenn from his home in Lucca, Tuscany. 'You have to really show something special, and if you make one mistake, you're off the list. 'I got my chance at [the semi-classic] Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne last year and I wasn't great there. And that was pretty much it, chance over.' Fenn's frustration has been compounded by watching the progress of others: riders such as Peter Sagan, who Fenn beat into second when he won the junior edition of the fabled Paris-Roubaix Classic in 2008. Sagan is now one of the sport's superstars, recently signing a €4 million deal with Tinkoff-Saxo. It's fair to say that Fenn has signed for considerably less at Sky. But the British team is one at which he should finally get his opportunity to ride Paris-Roubaix – famous for its cobbles, and known as the Hell of the North – which he is yet to even start as a senior. Fenn struggled to assert himself in the Omega team but has now signed a deal with Team Sky . In fact, in some respects Fenn and his new team are in the same boat: both have much to prove – and improve upon – in the Classics. In five years, while Brailsford's team has won the Tour de France twice, they have consistently failed in the major one-day events. Now they have lost their leader in these races, the Norwegian Edvald Boasson Hagen, it opens the door for a talented crop of British riders – Thomas, Ian Stannard, Ben Swift, Luke Rowe and perhaps Fenn, too. Fenn has just returned from Majorca and his first Sky training camp. 'It was really good, super well organised,' he says. 'Communication is massive and there's a really personal focus. Each rider is supported individually. 'We watched videos and talked. Dave [Brailsford] likes to make a speech – I've realised that. They do like to analyse things in depth, which is an approach that suits me. 'I also sat down with Dave and Rod [Ellingworth], who is now my coach. I was in the British Academy as a junior but never had much to do with either of them. They said: 'It's like we know you, but we don't, really.' So they're trying to understand me, and how I like to work.' Fenn is feeling positive after partaking in his first training camp with Team Sky in Majorca . Ellingworth is the coach who started the academy, and who is credited with launching the careers of Cavendish and Thomas, as well as masterminding Cavendish's world road race title in 2011. He admits that he doesn't really know why Fenn's career stalled – but he's confident he can jump-start it. 'He made such a great start, and he was given some opportunities, but for whatever reason he didn't piece them together,' says Ellingworth. 'His dreams are in the Classics but he was riding for the world's best Classics team. It's like a young guy trying to get in our Tour team – it's very difficult. You've got to be better than pretty good. 'But I've known Andy since he was 13, I've seen him come through as a schoolboy, and as a junior on the track and road, with great results. The talent is there, it's bubbling under: he just doesn't know how to get it out. 'I've been quite firm with him. I said, 'Potential is all well and good, but you're 24 now – you've got to show what you can do.' Ellingworth visited Fenn in October and told him, 'This is how I work, this is what I expect.' He asked him to write a list of his goals, plans and ideas. 'I' m not a big writer,' said Fenn. 'Neither am I,' said Ellingworth, 'but this is your job.' Fenn praised the impact and influence of coach Rod Ellingworth (left), pictured speaking to Thomas . Ellingworth believes that Fenn has lost confidence but says he will get a chance to prove his ability with Sky . 'Within three or four days I got an email,' says Ellingworth. 'He'd written quite a lot of stuff.' Ellingworth, who feels Fenn has lost confidence, was encouraged by that. 'Last night I got another update,' Ellingworth adds. Of one thing, Ellingworth is sure: 'He will get his chance in this team.' And that's all Fenn can ask for. 'It does feel a bit like coming home,' he says. 'It's definitely easier for me to fit in, though there are so many staff – more than any other team, so there are a lot of names to remember. 'But it's a clean slate. If you've made mistakes, you can move on. It does feel a bit like starting my career again.'","Andy Fenn's two debut wins for Omega Pharma-QuickStep were in front of Dave Brailsford in 2011 .

"Shane Sutton wants his British cycling team to be ‘Rio ready’ by January 1, 2015, which makes this weekend’s track cycling World Cup in London perfectly timed. Some of the signs are worrying, however. If the Rio Olympic Games were to begin on January 1, then there would arguably be only one event that Team GB would start as clear favourites: the women’s team pursuit. Led by the biggest star of the current team, Laura Trott, they have suffered just three defeats since the event was inaugurated at the 2008 world championships in Manchester. For the past four years they have established a 100 per cent record and in the London velodrome on Friday evening they extended that, racing to victory over Australia. Britain's cycling team technical director Shane Sutton (left) speaks with Laura Trott (right) Trott is now the star of the British team following the retirements of Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton . Trott (centre) won a gold medal at the London 2012 games with Dani King (left) and Joanna Rowsell (right) Across the whole squad, there seems little doubt the British team are feeling the absence of Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, the talismanic figures who retired in 2012 after each starring in two Olympic Games and contributing to the haul of 16 gold medals. The difficulty for Sutton, who replaced Sir Dave Brailsford as performance director in April, is in trying to maintain such dominance. ‘It’s all about continuous improvement,’ said Sutton of the squad’s philosophy, ‘so we’d like to think success would follow. ‘However, life goes in cycles,’ he added. ‘You have a talent pool and sometimes that gets saturated. I wouldn’t say we have a massive amount of talent but I do think we have the tools in the toolbox to do the job in Rio.’ The shallowness of the talent pool only accentuates the importance of Trott, the 22-year old from Essex who won two gold medals at London 2012. She will be 24 in Rio, 28 in Tokyo and could go on to 2024 and beyond. Pendleton was 27 when she won her first Olympic title, Hoy 28 when he claimed the first of his six gold medals, so it is far from inconceivable that Trott might succeed Hoy as Britain’s most decorated Olympian. Trott is fortunate to be surrounded by strong team-mates, with the emergence of Scotland’s Katie Archibald over the last 12 months bolstering the team pursuit squad. Trott (left) has been aided by the emergence of Scotland's Katie Archibald (right) Trott could become more decorated than Sir Chris Hoy (left) and Victoria Pendleton (right) But as Trott admitted on Friday evening, after the latest win, the competition is getting tougher all the time. ‘It’s getting harder,’ she said. ‘You definitely feel the pressure now.’ Today, Trott will go for a second World Cup gold medal in the omnium, which would repeat her double success at London 2012. She has something beyond mere talent that allows her to connect with the crowd and gets them behind her. The feeling is mutual. ‘I absolutely love it here,’ said Trott. ‘It’s nice to know they are totally behind you. You can hear them going absolutely nuts. It’s that spirit and energy that carries you around the track.’ If the women have Trott to lead the line, the men should have Sir Bradley Wiggins, who has promised to return for Rio. His presence will certainly lift a team pursuit squad who battled to a gold medal on Friday evening after perennial rivals Australia punctured in their semi-final.","Laura Trott has emerged as the leader of the British cycling team .

"Alex Neil is on the brink of being confirmed as Norwich City’s new manager after travelling south for talks. The Hamilton player-boss was left to weigh up his future when the New Douglas Park board accepted an approach from the Championship club. It is thought discussions with the Norwich hierarchy progressed positively and that — providing a compensation package is agreed — Neil is set to complete his move to England before Friday as replacement for Neil Adams. Alex Neil is set to take charge at Norwich after having talks with the club on Wednesday . Neil Adams resigned on Monday after less than nine months in charge of the Championship club . Confirmation of his appointment would continue a meteoric rise in management for the 33-year-old, who shot to the top of Norwich’s list of targets after guiding Accies to third place in the Scottish Premiership. Carrow Road chief executive David McNally is believed to view him as being in a similar mould to Paul Lambert, who enjoyed great success at the club before moving to Aston Villa. Neil will speak with Accies vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald before the club make any further public comment. In 2010, his predecessor Billy Reid rejected interest from Swansea City and opted instead to remain in Lanarkshire. The Hamilton manager, pictured during training on Monday, is set to be installed by Friday . Neil, however, has been presented with a hugely tempting opportunity given the facilities and resources at Norwich, who currently sit just three points below the play-off places. Compensation would be due not only on his 12-month rolling contract as manager, but also on a playing contract that runs until the end of the season. MacDonald was involved in those discussions last night after confirming Norwich’s bid via a statement. ‘Further to an official approach by Norwich City, permission was granted for our manager Alex Neil to meet the Norwich board,’ he said. ‘Alex travelled to Norwich today to view the stadium and training ground. Neil will leave his role as player manager at Hamilton, the club where he has been for nearly 10 years . ‘Alex will return tomorrow for a meeting with myself after which a further statement will be made. ‘We are delighted that Alex’s achievements have been recognised by this approach and that our policy of progressing players, staff and managers continues.’ Accies have lost just five of their 20 Premiership games this season and recorded a first win at Celtic Park in 76 years when they beat Ronny Deila’s men 1-0 in October. Neil would inherit a Norwich squad that features Scotland players Steven Whittaker and Russell Martin, as well as former Old Firm stars Gary Hooper, Kyle Lafferty and Carlos Cuellar. He would also be likely to work alongside former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan, who is currently first-team coach at Carrow Road.","Alex Neil travelled south for talks with Norwich on Wednesday .

"Australian Rohan Dennis will attempt to claim the hour record early next year amid reports Jack Bobridge and Alex Dowsett will also launch bids. Bobridge, the four-kilometre individual pursuit world record holder, and Dennis have track pedigree. Both were members of Australia's team pursuit squad which finished runners-up to Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics. Australian cyclist Rohan Dennis will attempt to break the hour record early next year . Dowsett also has a track background, but the Commonwealth Games time-trial gold medallist is not as accomplished on the boards as the Australian pair. The 26-year-old from Essex is expected to announce his attempt in London on Friday. Sir Bradley Wiggins has already stated the Hour is on his agenda for next June, with many predicting the six-time world track champion will set a long-lasting mark.

Sir Bradley Wiggins is widely expeted to break the record f he makes an attempt next June . BMC Racing's Dennis, whose attempt will take place in Switzerland in February, said on cyclingnews.com: 'When I look at my experience on the track and the numbers I have been doing on the track and road, it's within reach. 'As long as I don't get too excited at the start and control my nerves, the pacing will take care of itself.'

The champions lost their place at the top of the league to Aberdeen on New Year's Day when the Dons beat St Johnstone 2-0 at Pittodrie before the Hoops' game at Partick Thistle later on was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. With five points separating the top five sides ahead of Sunday's fixtures, the Parkhead men could find themselves further behind and in third place by the time Ronny Deila takes his team down to Kilmarnock on Monday night. Celtic defender Efe Ambrose (far left) is looking forward to competing with Aberdeen for the Scottish title . Ambrose and hos Celtic team-mates take on Aberdeen on Monday before flying out to Gran Canaria . However, the Celtic defender believes any possible threat to their title will simply bring the best out of the Celtic squad. 'Aberdeen are at the top and they deserve it, they are a great team and have been playing well,' said Ambrose. 'We respect them and we look for the challenge from them. Not just them, Dundee United, so we need to step up. 'The best of Celtic is going to come because we know there are teams behind us trying to take the title from us. 'What we need to do is win every game from now until the end of the season and I believe we have the ability and the squad that can do that. 'But it is easier said than done. People think it is easy for Celtic for win the league but it isn't. Ronny Deila and his players will spend time in the Canary Islands ahead of their match against Hamilton . 'Every team wants to beat Celtic so that makes it difficult. It puts pressure on us and it is not easy. We have to have the character. 'We have not been at our best, but that is football. 'I think it will change this year. Against Kilmarnock it is going to be a different Celtic team.' Celtic will fly out to Gran Canaria for a winter break following their first trip to Rugby Park this season. Deila insists he has no problems with playing on Killie's artificial pitch even though he has yet to see it. The Norwegian said: 'I think it is much better to play on a good artificial pitch than to play on bumpy natural grass. 'The tempo of the game is high and the ball will move very quick. 'I have a lot of experience with artificial pitch so it is normal for me but I understand it is different for the players.'","Celtic are currently one point behind Aberdeen in title race .

"Good health: Mary Berry, pictured, has said that children should be taught how to cook ten good value and healthy meals before they leave school . All children should be taught to cook ten full meals at school, television chef Mary Berry has said. Teachers should 'blow the science of it' and go back to showing young people 'what's good for them, how to buy it and how to make a few dishes that they enjoy and don't cost too much', she said. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the Great British Bake Off host told an audience she only took up cookery after being considered 'too dim' for academic subjects. She was sent to domestic science by teachers where she blossomed, she said. From there, a teacher praised her first efforts at making a treacle pudding and helped her develop her interest in cooking. When asked about the status of cookery teaching today, which can include lessons on nutrition and designing food packaging, she said: 'Hopefully it's coming back in schools. 'There is a drive for it to come back in schools and so there should be. 'But not in the form that it has been lately. 'It should be that every child when they leave school can do 10 meals, because when they leave home they've got to be able to eat healthily. 'Blow the science of it and everything else. They've just got to be able to know what's good for them, how to buy it and how to make a few dishes that they enjoy and don't cost too much.' Mary, 78, also paid her Great British Bake Off colleagues Mel and Sue a compliment about their skills in the kitchen during the festival. Education: Mary said it was important for young people to learn about healthy cooking, nutrition and food packaging while still at school . According to the Radio Times, she said: 'Mel and Sue are competent bakers… just. 'They are a sheer delight to work with. It is laughter all the way.' Mary's appearance comes as it was revealed the chef had cooked up a fortune of £15million. The chef was catapulted to TV favourite over the past three years after appearing opposite Paul Hollywood in the hugely successful BBC2 show. But she has long had a thriving career - publishing more than 60 best-selling recipe books. She also has a hugely successful cooking sauce and condiment business - including dressings and chutneys. Fame: Mary, who is best known for co-hosting The Great British Bake Off, has released over 60 cookery books over her long career . Official figures for her condiments company, Mary Berry And Daughter Ltd, show the business made a profit of £1.076million in 2012, with cash assets of more than £1million. Should children be taught how to cook ten different meals at school? Mary also owns property worth at least £10million with her retired antique-book seller husband, Paul. Her company HQ is based alongside her home in Buckinghamshire, where she owns more than two acres, including a lake. In the past eight years it is estimated Mary has amassed £2.3million from her book sales. Her media income since the launch of The Great British Bake Off is believed to be more than £200,000 a year.","Co-host of Great British Bake Off said children should be taught how to cook a selection of healthy and good-value meals .

"For Hearts fans, Christmas Eve will see them wake up in receipt of a gift that not long ago was beyond even their wildest dreams. Back in the dark days of relegation from the Premiership in May, after administration and its accompanying 15 point deduction, little could those followers who merrily sang festive songs on repeat on Tuesday night at Central Park have dreamed of how 2014 would eventually pan out. This deserved win over Cowdenbeath, achieved thanks to goals in either half from front two James Keatings and Callum Paterson, ensured Robbie Neilson's relentless team streaked 12 points clear of nearest challengers Rangers. Callum Paterson doubles his side's lead with a spectacular left foot strike from the edge of the box . Striker Paterson volleyed into the top corner to seal a comfortable win for Hearts . Chambers celebrates as his goal sealed the victory for the visitors at Central Park on Tuesday . Cowdenbeath: Thomson, Miller, O'Brien, Wedderburn, Halsman, Kane (Campbell 72), Marshall, Johnston (Jurisic 81), Milne, Callaghan (Sutherland 45), Higgins . Subs not used: Brownlie, Lynas, Sneddon, Scullion . Booked: Wedderburn 27 . Hearts: Alexander, McGhee, McKay, Wilson, Eckersley, Buaben (Holt 82), Pallardo, Gonzalez, Gomis, Paterson, Keatings (Nicholson 60), Walker (Buchanan 87) Subs not used: Robinson, Gallacher, Oliver, Flanagan . Scorer(s): Keatings 25, Paterson 62 . Referee: Greg Aitken . Attendance: 3,718 . In wrapping up a remarkable 47 points out of the 51 available so far in the Championship, his side has outscored every team in the league, conceded less than any other and outclassed all. With Rangers enmeshed in unprecedented turmoil this week – even by their miserable standards at troubled Ibrox – it's tempting just to wrap up the title now and deliver it to Tynecastle first thing on Wednesday morning. Robbie Neilson won't think like that, of course. Ever the professional, the unexcitable Hearts boss will instead preach the same mantra. That his side should merely focus on the next match, away to Livingston on Saturday, and aim to round off the year in style. But in truth would take a capitulation to far outstrip Devon Loch in the 1956 Grand National for the Edinburgh club not to reclaim their place in the top flight after 12 months. Indeed, Hearts could even be 15 ahead by Saturday evening, should Rangers, in the wake of manager Ally McCoist leaving and his No 2 Ian Durrant's demotion, succumb to Hibs at Easter Road in Kenny McDowall's first match as a manager. Paterson is congratulated by his team-mates as Hearts opened up a 12-point lead over Rangers . James Keatings wheels away in celebration after giving Hearts the lead against Cowdenbeath . They used to say McCoist the striker, long before his tough spell in management, could fall into the River Clyde and emerge holding a fish supper. The same, so far, is true for Neilson in the dugout. He has barely put a foot wrong so far in his first post in management. Given the unpredictable December weather, his bold decision to rearrange this match just 10 days after a frozen pitch rendered the game unplayable had been widely questioned. But Neilson wanted it played, wanted it won, and last night he got his wish amid crisp and clear conditions on a decent playing surface. Last night's win was not luck, though, as Neilson would surely point out. The Hearts boss, who prides himself on his attention to detail, arranged a pre-season game here in the summer to familiarise himself with the dimensions of the Central Park pitch. That prompted him to ditch his favoured 4-4-2 with wide midfielders in favour of a 4-3-1-2. It was left to his fullbacks Jordan McGhee and Adam Eckersley to prove the attacking width. Keatings is mobbed by his team-mates after netting in the first half to set up an away victory . Paterson (left) vies for possession with Cowdenbeath's Thomas O'Brien . And it was a ploy that worked a treat with Eckersley's cutback setting up Keatings for the crucial opening goal from six yards. It was the former Celtic trainee's third in his last three games, and his seventh of the season. It was full reward for Hearts' dominance from the first whistle, after both sets of fans had held an impeccably-observed minute's silence in honour of all those affected by the horrific bin lorry tragedy in Glasgow on Monday. Keatings, the former Hamilton striker who elected not to go up with Accies to aid the Tynecastle side's promotion drive, nearly grabbed a quickfire second. But his fierce freekick from 20 yards beat keeper Robbie Thompson only to smack back off the bottom left post and away to safety. As Hearts searched for a second, Keatings then set up Paterson, whose shot fizzed narrowly wide of the post. Hearts' Jamie Walker (right) lunges into a challenge on Liam Callaghan of Cowdenbeath . Cowdenbeath were holding onto the ball well but Hearts worked ever so hard to close them down the home side was largely restricted to shooting from distance in vain. On the one occasion they did slice through Hearts, keeper Neil Alexander was the hero of the hour with a fine save from 16 yards. Higgins, however, should have burst the net with his low drive. Neilson then made the decision to replace Keatings with Sam Nicholson after 60 minutes; a decision that was surely down to injury. If it wasn't, no matter. The Hearts boss' Midas touch remained, as within 120 seconds his team was 2-0 up. Miguel Pallardo's cross was cleared and Paterson first headed the ball, then chested it and finally blasted home a festive cracker from 20 yards. It was a quality goal that underlined the 20-year-old's versatility. Paterson shone up front last night but in November he was called up by Scotland for cover at his regular position, right back, after Phil Bardsley had pulled out of matches against the Republic of Ireland and England. The Hearts players observe a minute's silence in memory of those who were tragically killed in an accident in Glasgow city centre on Monday . After that a shot fired into the side netting by sub Craig Sutherland and a header from the same player saved by Alexander was about as good as it got for Jimmy Nicholl's men. They never looked like rescuing anything from this game and many home fans headed for the exits a good 20 minutes before time. The Hearts fans, by contrast, remained to the end and were jubilant at the final whistle. They sported the delirious demeanour of a set of fans who have now not witnessed a league defeat on the road since at Kilmarnock on March 8. 'We shall not be moved,' they sang. And who, frankly, could disagree?","Hearts beat Cowdenbeath 2-0 at Central Park in the Championship .

"Newcastle have been rebuffed in an initial attempt to sign M'Baye Niang from AC Milan. The former Caen forward has been courted by Arsenal, Tottenham, Everton and West Ham over recent seasons. The 20-year-old would like to join a Premier League side with Milan willing to let him leave, and wanting to add an option to buy clause to the deal, but Niang is also waiting to see if any other offers come in. AC Milan have turned down an approach from West Ham to sign forward M'Baye Niang . The French striker has previously attracted interest from Arsenal, Tottenham, Everton and West Ham . The Frenchman courted a similar move away from the San Siro 12 months ago - leaving Milan for a six-month loan spell with Ligue 1 side Montpellier, which did not work out as well as hoped. Although he scored on his debut against Rodez in the Coupe de France and managed four more goals in the first few months, his form dropped dramatically afterwards and he only netted once more in the next 17 games before being returned to Milan. The Magpies are also reportedly willing to take Niang on a six-month loan deal, providing that an option to buy the striker outright at the end of the season is included. Newcastle may also have to fend off recent interest from the likes of Olympiakos and Udinese if they want to secure the striker's signature.

"Pleaded guilty: Tanya Brookes, 46, wore her police ID as she persuaded shops to give her a full refund for luxury items she bought at a cut price . A police chief inspector has been convicted of a catalogue of petty frauds after tricking High Street stores into giving a full refund for discounted luxury items. Chief Inspector Tanya Brookes, 46, bought cut-price breast pumps, Micro Scooters and cashmere blankets in bulk on eBay and in discount outlets. The mother-of-four then created false bank statements on a computer showing she paid the full amount for the high-end items - then took them to different stores for a full refund. Wearing her police ID lanyard, she would demand a refund in what the prosecution branded an abuse of trust. Brookes, who worked under her maiden name of Sillett, was found guilty to 25 counts of fraud and cleared of two at an earlier trial. Today, she pleaded guilty at . Winchester Crown Court to a further eight charges of fraud. Sentencing has been adjourned until May 6. Nicholas Tucker, prosecuting, described Brookes as a 'high-flyer' who went to great lengths to carry out petty frauds despite earning a 'healthy salary'. Though she was not on duty at the time of the offences, he added she used her position in Surrey Police Force to manipulate High Street staff. He said: 'It is our case that despite the healthy salaries which she and . her husband enjoyed as senior police officers, Mrs Brookes - for . reasons which may remain a mystery - expended an extraordinary amount of . effort and her own time devising various scams, principally targeted . against High Street retailers. 'To compound matters, we say that on . occasion she exploited her status as a police officer in order to . inspire trust in individuals she meant to deceive.' Her main targets were Boots, Waitrose, Micro Scooter and luxury homeware store The White Company. At first, she bought Poitier cotton sheets and satin-edged cashmere blankets from The White Company's outlet store in Bicester, Oxfordshire, before taking them back to the Godalming store with a false bank statement. Then, she bought £35 Sculptinex facial treatments, £120 Clearblue fertility monitors and £130 Medela breast pumps in bulk on eBay - and took them back to Boots for their full retail price. Mr Tucker also told the court how Brookes bought forged discount vouchers for Lurpak online and used them in Waitrose. Luxury homeware store The White Company was one of her main targets, as she bought cashmere blankets for a discount and took them back to the store with false bank statements . Boots handed out hundreds of pounds to the former chief inspector when she produced false statements claiming she had paid the full price for £130 breast pumps and £120 fertility monitors . She would falsify a bank statement on her computer showing that the full . price for the product had been paid and return it to another branch of . the store and fraudulently reclaim the difference in price. She would . tell shop staff that the items had been bought by 'an extravagant great . aunt'. Mr Tucker said: 'Mrs Brookes would often be wearing her . police ID on a lanyard round her neck - this was irregular, and the . prosecution say it was a ploy by Mrs Brookes to capitalise on the trust . people tend to place in police officers.' In another scam outlined . by the prosecution, Brookes offered to organise a stall selling Micro . Scooters at her son’s nursery. Mr Tucker said that despite the fact that . the PTA declined her offer, Brookes went ahead with the plan and when she received the two promotional scooters offered by the . manufacturer, she returned them to the Kingston branch of John Lewis in exchange for vouchers and a different Micro Scooter. A further five offences which she . denied were ordered to lie on file. A further two charges of acting with . intent to prejudice/defraud HM Revenue and Customs which were due to be . heard at a third trial will also now lie on file. Last . month Brookes, of Godalming, Surrey, was found guilty following a trial . of nine offences of making an article used in fraud, 14 of fraud and . two of converting criminal property. She was found not guilty of a . further two offences. Outlet: Brookes, 46, made trips to Bicester Village, the outlet street in Oxfordshire, to buy cheap items . Details . of the previous trial could not be reported until all outstanding cases . against Brookes had concluded. Her case was adjourned for sentencing on . May 6. Following the hearing, assistant chief constable Gavin Stephens, of . Surrey Police, said: 'We expect the highest standards of conduct from . all of our employees and this kind of behaviour has no place in Surrey . Police. 'The vast majority of our officers and staff who serve the . people of this county are professional and hard-working and the public . rightly trust them to act with integrity at all times. 'We will not . hesitate to thoroughly investigate any evidence of wrong-doing and take . swift action if any officer is involved in criminality. 'This was a . complex investigation but thanks to the painstaking work of the officers . involved, the scale of offending behaviour by Tanya Brookes was . uncovered and she has been brought to justice.

"A mother battling leukaemia has seen her three brothers - her last chance of a life-saving bone marrow transplant - barred from Britain. Fatemeh Mehdipour, 42, has undergone three aggressive courses of chemotherapy since she was diagnosed with the the disease in June. Her siblings Nader, Naser and Esmaeil are the closest surgical matches to the patient but they have all been refused visas to fly to Britain from Iran. Fatehmeh Mehdipour, left, needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die, pictured with husband Habib, right . Mrs Mehidipour's brothers, Nader, centre and Esmail, right, were refused travel visas to the UK from Iran . Mrs Mehidipour's third brother Naser was also denied permission to travel to the UK for testing . The Home Office said it was 'not satisfied' they would be 'genuine visitors' and feared they would seek to stay in Britain after their visas expired. The mother-of-two said: 'I am just waiting for this transplant. I need this transplant. 'I could not believe it. I just hope the Embassy can get them the visas. 'When I think about my situation, how can I relax and concentrate on my chemotherapy? It is not easy.' Mrs Mehdipour's devastated daughter Azar, 24, said: 'We were all so positive, and thought mum would be having her transplant. 'Everyone is so angry - she will die if she doesn't get this transplant. 'She needs it within four weeks. 'The chance of us finding an unrelated donor is almost zero - there is a real shortage of Middle-Eastern donors. 'I can't describe what we have been going through. 'When my mother asks me if she is going to die, it kills me inside and out.' Medics in Birmingham wrote a letter supporting the visa application to allow for a possible transplant operation . The Home Office wrote to Mrs Mehdipour's brother in Iran confirming that they will not be issued a visa . Mrs Mehdipour, who lives in Solihull, West Midlands moved to the Britain 12 years ago. Her husband Habib, 51, and a wholesale retailer, said: 'It is so hard for somebody to undergo chemotherapy anyway but I do not personally think she can bare with it. It is so hard for us.' Her brothers applied to visit the UK for 15 days at the British Embassy in Turkey. But their applications were rejected despite doctors at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, where she is receiving treatment, vouching for them. Consultant haemotologist Dr Bhuvan Kishore wrote to the embassy saying: 'In order to cure her leukaemia she is in need of a bone marrow transplant; without it she may die. 'It is imperative you allow her siblings to travel to the UK to have further testing to establish which one is likely to be the best donor for her. 'Fatemeh has an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukaemia which is incurable without a transplant. 'She is lucky enough to have three siblings who are a match. 'But they need to donate stem cells as soon as possible so she can proceed with a potentially curable treatment.' Yet, astonishingly, an immigration officer told the brothers in a letter: 'I am not satisfied you are a genuine visitor to the United Kingdom or that you intend to leave the United Kingdom on completion of your proposed visit.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits, including any compelling and compassionate circumstances, and in line with immigration rules. 'The onus is on the individual to ensure they provide all the necessary evidence when submitting an application.'","Fatemeh Mehdipour needs a life-saving bone marrow transplant .

"A birthday party hosted by the parliamentary aide to Home Secretary Theresa May over the weekend was so loud the police had to attend - twice. Tory MP George Hollingbery, 50, was warned by officers to turn the noise down when they were called to what neighbours described as his 'mini festival' at a village in Hampshire. Disgruntled residents living in the village said they could not sleep as loud music boomed until 2.30am on Saturday night. Scroll down for video . MP George Hollingbery threw a party over the weekend but police were called when residents complaned . They said the night was 'horrendous' and claimed they could hear the songs over their televisions. The lavish private party - which came complete with stylish teepees and 'glamping' - was to celebrate his daughter Jessica's s 21st and a joint 50th birthday bash for himself and his wife. A live band, DJs and several hundred guests attended the party on the grounds of Mr Hollingbery's country house. But officers visited his home at 11.30pm over complaints about bright lights and again an hour later to tell him to turn the music down. The band played until 1.30am while other music continued. Mr Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley, received a final message from Hampshire Constabulary at 1.43am requesting he turn the noise down. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was totally horrendous. The Meon Valley Tory MP has since apologised for causing a noise disturbance when he threw the  party . 'It didn't matter whether we had double glazing, earplugs or whether we dragged a mattress to the other side of the house. 'Even playing classical music on a radio to drown it out would not have worked - we could not get to sleep until about half past two. 'It's not music then, it's an aural assault. It was an invasion of your privacy and an invasion of your own mental space.' The party was jointly for Mr Hollingbery and his wife's 50th birthdays and daughter Jessica's 21st (pictured) Another resident dubbed the party as 'more like a mini festival'. The large country house in Hampshire where the party took place - guests glamped in the grounds in teepees . The MP, private parliamentary secretary to Ms May, has previously spoken out over noise pollution in his constituency. In an article for parish magazines in April, he said that noise from large groups of bikers on county roads was an issue. He said: 'It is a real problem, particularly at weekends and on summer evenings when the noise can be continuous for residents.' In a statement, Mr Hollingbery said he was 'very sorry' for the disruption. He said: 'I'm very sorry that some residents were upset and inconvenienced by noise from a private party I held at my house on Saturday. 'It was my daughter's 21st and myself and my wife's 50th joint birthday celebration and comprised of several hundred guests and a band and DJs. 'It appears that the music was too loud on this occasion and when we realised it was an issue the sound was turned down and the band stopped playing at just after 1.30am. MP Mr Hollingbery has spoken out about noise pollution in his constituency in the past . 'I also took measures to limit noise from other parts of the party. 'The police did attend the party twice: once at around 11.30pm after a call to investigate light from the party and once about noise about an hour later. 'On the second occasion an officer spoke to my wife and we offered to turn the sound down and that was done. 'An officer left a voice message officially asking us to turn the noise down and that was received at 1.43am. 'By this point the band, which was the main source of the noise, had stopped playing. 'Music was playing in other areas but this was also kept very low and we received no further visits and no further telephone calls from the police after 1.43am. 'Over the years, we have held quite a few parties at my house - the vast majority of them for charity - and this is the first time there has been a problem with noise. 'I truly understand it was clearly unpleasant for some of our neighbours and I very much hope they will accept my sincere apologies.' Mr Hollingbery said the party was for friends and family and that Ms May did not attend. He was elected at the 2010 general election as the Member of Parliament for Meon Valley. He offered no comment when asked  how the incident reflects on his position in the Home Office.","Party thrown by MP George Hollingbery at lavish £1.5 million country house .

"Ex-Chelsea footballer and Match of the Day pundit Gavin Peacock has been accused of sexism over a series of controversial tweets. The married father-of-two, who is now a preacher, said women should submit to men because it is 'God's design'. The 47-year-old father-of-two,who amassed 542 league appearances for clubs including Newcastle, Chelsea and QPR before retiring in 2002, received an angry backlash from followers with some suggesting that he was 'sexist'. Scroll down for video . Ex-Chelsea footballer Gavin Peacock, picture right playing for the club in the mid 90s, has been accused of sexism over a series of tweets. Peacock, also pictured left, is now a preacher in Canada . Among those to respond to his post was BBC sports presenter Jacqui Oatley, who used to work with Peacock and was the first female commentator on Match of the Day. She wrote 'Gav?!' She went on to post: 'Gav’s a really good man with strong religious views. Many will disagree, though.' Before adding: 'Not ideal timing to be talking about female submission with the Ched Evans story ongoing.' In the first tweet Peacock wrote: 'Husbands: one of your primary duties in loving your wife is to feed her with the Word of God daily.' This was followed moments later by: 'Wives: one of the primary ways you are to respect your husband is by gladly submitting to and encouraging his leadership.' Finally he told his 4,992 follower's: 'God's divine design for marriage in male headship and female submission is complementary not competitive.' Talksport commentator Nigel Adderley said: 'I used to really enjoy working with Gavin Peacock on the radio but won't be implementing his views on marriage at home...' Peacock, who has been a Christian since he was 18, abandoned his broadcasting career in 2008 to become a pastor . Comedian Josh Widdicombe tweeted: 'Oh my, Gavin Peacock is having a disaster on twitter today. Has Eddie Newton got hold of his account as part of a dressing room prank?' Another user said: 'Remember Gavin Peacock who played for Chelsea? He's found God and he's tweeting some DELIGHTFUL things about women.' Peacock scored 108 goals in an 18-year professional career, before briefly working with the BBC and Chelsea's official website. He abandoned his broadcasting career in 2008 after answering a religious calling  and is now a pastor at the at the Calvary Grace Church in Calgary, Canada.

Peacock, who has been a Christian since he was 18, told the Express: 'I started doing some preliminary Old and New Testament studies. 'I knew then I was being called to it full-time. I call it my joyful compulsion. I love it, but I must do it.' Peacock has been contacted by the MailOnline for comment.

"Roberto Martinez is confident Everton have finally resolved the hamstring issue that has ruined James McCarthy’s season. The Republic of Ireland midfielder had been Everton’s outstanding performer but he has spent much of the past two months on the sidelines. He missed six games after being injured in a Europa League tie in Wolfsburg on November 27 but then returned for two matches against Stoke and Newcastle but was substituted in both. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Premier League preview: Everton vs Manchester City . Roberto Martinez is confident Everton have got to the bottom of James McCarthy's recent injury troubles . McCarthy has subsequently been ruled out of the defeat by Hull on New Year’s Day and the 1-1 draw with West Ham in the FA Cup and is unlikely to figure against Manchester City on Saturday. Martinez, though, is satisfied that they have got to the bottom of the problem and he is predicting McCarthy will not be troubled by such injuries in the future. Martinez said: ‘James is developing well. We need to make sure when he comes back he is 100 per cent ready for the second half of the season. It is making sure over the next three or four weeks we get everyone fit and ready. McCarthy, pictured during the Merseyside derby, played against Stoke and Newcastle but had to be replaced . ‘We have got to the bottom of it and it will help him for the rest of his career. We have looked at his nutrition and how he recovers. He is a very peculiar profile of a midfielder as he is more of a sprinter. Midfielders are usually about stamina. ‘But James is a sprinter and those players need extra care. I think we have got to the bottom of it and now we have to make sure we manage it. I am sure when he will be back, he will be back for good.' Everton have not won since December 15 but manager Martinez is looking forward to taking on Man City .

"They may be going head to head to open for England in the Ashes this summer, but it was honours even after day one of the fight as Sam Robson and Adam Lyth both cracked hundreds for England Lions on Monday. On day one of a three-day game against a Gauteng Invitational XI in Soweto, England racked up 361 for four in 90 overs. The third man in the frame to partner Alastair Cook against Australia — Yorkshire opener Alex Lees — also impressed with 82 not out. Middlesex’s Robson and Yorkshire’s Lyth combined superbly to put on 176 for the first wicket. Robson was slightly the more fluent on a slow pitch with some excellent square cuts among his 12 fours as well as an fine straight hit for his sole six. He reached 109 off 152 balls before retiring. Sam Robson (pictured in July, 2014) scored 109 off of 152 balls before retiring against Gauteng Invitational XI . Adam Lyth (pictured in December) also scored a century on the first day of the three-day game . Lyth played some lovely cover drives and reached his ton with a leg-side flick for four. His 106 came off 171 balls before he retired. Jonathan Trott returned to the crease in England colours for the first time since his horror tour Down Under last winter. Trott is Lions captain but could not begin his campaign with significant runs. He fell for six, caught behind by his opposite number Sizwe Masondo off teenager Keith Dudgeon, who has played one first-class match. James Vince was then just the second authentic departure of the day, caught at cover off medium-pacer Nono Pongolo after he had made seven. But Lees, with an attractive 82 not out off 132 balls, put on an undefeated 86 for the fifth wicket with yet another Yorkshire batter, Jonny Bairstow, who finished 32 not out. Lees launched his 13th ball off the splendidly named left-arm spinner Dale Deeb for six but was then dropped at short leg. England will find things tougher when they face the South African A team in the first of two Tests starting on Sunday.

"They are neck-and-neck in the Barclays Premier League, their identical records separable only by their position in the alphabet. But which of Chelsea and Manchester City boasts the better academy? We'll find out as their respective Under 21 teams meet at Hyde's Ewen Fields ground on Thursday night. The London side currrently top the Under 21 Premier League but it's close, with fifth-place City just one-point behind them. City, who are led by Patrick Vieira, are chasing a measure of revenge after Adi Viveash's Chelsea beat them 2-1 in the reverse fixture back in August. And memories of last season's play-off semi-final will also be fresh in the mind, when eventual winners Chelsea beat City on penalties at the Etihad Stadium. It should be a great showcase of emerging talent and you can follow all the action live. The match kicks off at 7.45pm. Host commentator . Celina, who came on with less than 15 minutes to play, proved the hero with his late, late winner. Manchester City's next generation move above Chelsea in the standings with a two-point cushion. Bersant Celina comes off the bench to score what is surely the winner. The second half substitute plays the ball to Ntcham and takes the return pass to fire past Beeney to restore his side's lead. Both sides pressing for the winner. Solanke, Loftus-Cheek and Ake have impressed since th break. Chelsea defender Aina makes a great run int the box to meet Musonda's cross but he mis-times his strike and it blazes over the bar. Great opportunity for Chelsea to take the lead. It's that man Solanke again as the Blues striker pounces in the box to level matters up. Chelsea, powered by Loftus-Cheek and Ake, have grown into this game in the second half and were fully deserving of that goal. Manchester City will bump Chelsea off the top of the U21 Premier League table if they hold onto their lead in the second half. Can Chelsea respond? After conceding that early goal to Dominic Solanke, City have recovered and stamped their authority on this fixture. Brandon Barker and Thierry Ambrose have been outstanding for the home side with their goals helping City into a 2-1 lead at the break. There's plenty more goals left in this one you sense. Plenty to admire from both sides so far with Loftus-Cheek and Ake impressing in midfield for the Blues. It's the same story again. Barker unleashes a powerful shot but Beeney is equal to it before Ambroe follows up and heads over the bar. The Chelsea keeper's heroics have kept his side in this contest, no question. Barker shows great pace down the left and sends a teasing cross in the box. Ambrose takes a heavy touch on his right but manages to get a shot away on his left. But Beeney comes to the rescue to thwart Ambrose once more. Ambrose makes no mistake this time! The City striker gets one-on-one with Beeney, after being played in by Jose Angel Pozo, and drives his shot past the Chelsea keeper in the 24th minute. Great comeback for City after conceding that early goal. They now lead 2-1 and are very much in control of this contest. The Chelsea goalkeeper who stands strong to City's Thierry Ambrose in the box. Ambrose got into a great position and releases a powerful shot but Beeney makes a great save to keep the scores level. Nathan Ake has made six appearances for the Chelsea first team under Jose Mourinho this season. Mourinho sees Ake as very much a member of his first-team squad but wants to see the youngster impose himself on a fixture like this. Ake and fellow Ruben Loftus-Cheek will certainly be players to watch tonight. What a reply from Manchester City. Brandon Barker makes a daring run down the left wing and equalises for the visitors. Frantic start to this contest at Hyde's Ewen Fields . Just 97 seconds between those two goals. Dominic Solanke get the Blues off to a perfect start with a well taken strike in the second minute! Gunn, Maffeo, Evans, Bryan, Angelino, Glendon (c), Ambrose, Ntcham, Pozo, Bytyqi, Barker. Subs: O'Brien, Bossaerts, Byrne, Celina, Hiwula .

"Bells which ring out every day from a 500-year-old village church could be silenced after a local resident complained they were making too much noise. St Martin's Church in Liskeard, Cornwall has been a part of the market town since 1428. But Graham Dutnall, 60, who lives 300 yards away says, the historic church's bells are making too much noise, and has lodged a complaint with the local council. The bells in St Martin's Church in Liskeard, Cornwall, have rung out across the market town since 1428 . Mr Dutnall who recorded the bells' sound at at 85 decibels, as loud as passing traffic, told the council they are 'destroying his peace and quiet'. Cornwall Council has dispatched environmental health officers with noise measuring equipment to listen for themselves. If they act upon Mr Dutnall's complaint, church leaders face having to drastically cut down the frequency of the ringing or pay for expensive sound dampening equipment. Mr Dutnall said: 'Pubs, restaurants, cafes and shops have to have a licence to make noise like that. 'But for some reason church bells seem to be out of the loop - they can do what they like. 'Liskeard is a beautiful, peaceful town but this is ruining all that; it is destroying the peace and quiet in Liskeard. 'They make a hell of a lot of noise - they are designed to be heard.' Mr Dutnall said he has a direct line of sight to the church and has no way of escaping the bells, which ring out three times each week and can be heard for miles. He added: 'At the right place and at the right time there's nothing wrong with it. But it is so frequent and so loud.' Grade I listed St Martin's Church was built as a small church in 1428 but developed over the years with the addition of new chapels, aisles, a chancel and a tower. It is now one of the largest churches in Cornwall with its current bell tower housing eight bells. Graham Dutnall lives 300 yards away from the church and has complained its bells are making too much noise . Reverend Tony Ingleby revealed the church had faced a similar complaint before but he was not aware of the latest investigation. He said the majority of people considered the bells a timeless tradition that helps gives Liskeard its special character. Mr Ingleby said: 'When you go and live somewhere that is near a church the chances are that there are going to be bells rung. 'There is a church tower and you can see it from the A38. Most people see it as an advantage to hear the bells. 'The team ring every Thursday evening and at 11am and 6pm on Sunday. They are also chimed on a Wednesday, although this is not as loud. 'People had previously reported the bells to the council's environmental health officers but they decided that it was within normal ranges. 'If people have issues with them then I am happy to talk about it but I have not had any complaints. 'When this issue was raised a few years ago there was a great many letters written in support of the bells.' Other residents of the market town do not share Mr Dutnall's disdain for the bells. Maggie McPherson, 70, who has lived close to the church for 14 years, described the complaint as 'downright silly'. She said: 'It's a lovely part of village life. It's unbelievable that someone would complain about such a lovely thing. 'A lovely part of village life': Other local residents don't share Mr Dutnall's opinion of the bells with some saying they contribute to the village's personality . 'Everyone I know of who lives close by enjoys the bells. They have always been played and I hope they will continue to be played. 'They're not any louder than other church bells I've heard and when I'm in my house I can only hear them very vaguely. I think it's ludicrous for someone to submit a complaint about this.' Another resident, Maureen Wills, 72, added: 'They've been played every week since I've moved here and I'm very fond of them. It's exactly what you would expect when living close to a church.' Mr Dutnall's complaint was first raised with Liskeard Town Council, who referred him to Cornwall Council's environmental health department. A spokesman for Cornwall Council said: 'The Community Protection team of the Council's Public Health and Protection Service investigate complaints of noise from various sources. 'The main legislation that is used when assessing statutory noise nuisance complaints is the Environmental Protection Act 1990. 'There are no set noise limits when determining what a statutory noise nuisance is so trained officers need to determine whether any noise being complained about is an unreasonable interference. 'Many factors are considered when assessing a noise nuisance complaint including the time, duration, frequency and reasonableness of the noise being complained about. 'Each complaint is investigated on its own merits and where it is considered necessary formal action can be taken to ensure that any nuisance is abated.'","St Martin's Church in Liskeard, Cornwall is over 500-years-old .

"Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy has come out in defence of Premier League initiation ceremonies for new arrivals - and revealed Florent Sinama Pongolle's dancing when he arrived at the Reds 'was the best thing' he'd ever seen. Murphy's comments come in the wake of the Professional Footballers' Association's attempts to ban clubs from being able to initiate new signings. And the ex-England and Fulham star believes initiation ceremonies are, in many cases, harmless - using the example of Sinama Pongolle to highlight this. Florent Sinama Pongolle's (left) dancing during his initiation ceremony impressed his Liverpool team-mates . Danny Murphy (left) claims that Sinama Pongolle's dancing was 'the best thing I'd ever seen' Murphy told TalkSPORT: 'I remember a young French kid at Liverpool called Sinama Pongolle. 'We were on a night out initiating some of the young players and he said: ""I can't sing, do you mind if I dance?"" 'So we were like ""no"" and we put this song on and said: ""Show us what you've got"".

"Bath have welcomed Rhys Priestland’s determination to claim their No 10 shirt ahead of England’s George Ford next season after confirming that they have signed the Welshman. The 27-year-old Scarlets fly-half will move to The Rec at the end of this season to join a growing Wales contingent in the Aviva Premiership. He has chosen to sign for Bath for a salary of £250,000-£300,000, despite having Ford as a pedigree rival. Priestland’s move is likely to curtail his Test career after the World Cup as Wales are ready to enforce a restriction on the selection of players who agree future deals abroad while the WRU’s new dual-contract system takes effect. But his decision comes against a backdrop of abuse dished out by supporters, which was condemned by coach Shaun Edwards. Wales international fly-half Rhys Priestland will sign for Premiership side Bath at the end of the season . The fly-half, in action against Premiership side Leicester Tigers, will join Bath in the summer . Being harshly cast as a scapegoat has evidently taken its toll on a player who has been usurped in the Wales ranks by Dan Biggar, while the Blues’ Kiwi recruit, Gareth Anscombe, is being lined up for a swift call-up to represent the land of his mother. Yesterday, he spoke of ‘great highs and some heartfelt lows’ during his decade of first-team service to the Scarlets, his home region, while talking of his need for a ‘new challenge’, which Ford will most certainly present. Mike Ford, the incumbent’s father and Bath’s head coach, said: ‘Rhys is a fantastic player with an impressive pedigree. He’s got a wide range of talents that suit our gameplan and he’ll make a great addition to our squad. He’s still quite a young guy, but one with a lot of experience that will be really valuable, especially in the development of our younger players.’ Priestland, in action against Australia in the Autumn internationals, will leave the Scarlets for Bath . Another of Bath’s coaches, Toby Booth, insisted Priestland will not be coming to make up the numbers or act as a utility option, despite also having experience at full back. ‘Rhys is an international No 10 and he is coming here to play at 10,’ said Booth. ‘He is coming here to push George and compete for that position. ‘We believe we need ultimate competition in those positions. That’s why Owen Farrell has become the player that he has — because he’s had Charlie Hodgson with him at Saracens, competing with him for that place. Rhys Priestland is coming here to be the starting-choice 10. Priestland, in action for Wales, has 32 caps for his country but was not offered a national dual contract . The Wales international fly-half says he is signing for Bath in the English Premiership for a new challenge . 'That’s the conversation we had with him and he said that he wouldn’t come here if there was any other intention.’ Priestland has made 147 senior appearances for the Scarlets and is poised to overtake Stephen Jones as the Llanelli-based region’s leading points-scorer. Head coach Wayne Pivac said: ‘He’s been a big part of the region for a long period of time. We were keen to retain Rhys but were unable to do so. His leadership qualities, experience and maturity will be missed. He goes with our blessing and he will always be a Scarlet.’ The 27-year-old picks out a pass in the Autumn internationals for Wales against Fiji at the Millennium Stadium . Priestland will hope to be part of Warren Gatland's plans for Wales despite moving to play club rugby in Bath .","The 27-year-old joined Scarlets in 2005, graduating from their academy .

"Liverpool icon Steven Gerrard was announced as LA Galaxy's new signing on Wednesday and as a show of a respect to his boyhood club the former England captain stopped short of posing in the shirt of his new employers. Supporters of the MLS side won't see the 34-year-old in a Galaxy jersey until July but EA Sports have given fans a quick glimpse of what Gerrard will look like in their colours. Gerrard, who will end a 26-year association with Liverpool this summer, gave an interview to Galaxy TV on Wednesday where he insisted he was joining the California-based club to win trophies and cap off his fine career. Steven Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in the MLS in July and EA Sports show fans how he'll look next season . EA Sports have been quick to mock up a brief video of Gerrard in an Galaxy strip and show the Liverpool legend walking on to the pitch at the StubHub Center in California where he'll feature next season. The EA Sports Instagram posted the video with the caption: '@EASportsFIFA has your first look at Steven Gerrard in an #LAGalaxy jersey. #StevieLAG.' Gerrard claims he still has the hunger to succeed in football and  wants to add more titles to his trophy haul with the five-time MLS champions. ‘Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,’ Gerrard told Galaxy TV. ‘I’m not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I’m going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable. EA Sports tease LA Galaxy fans at the start of this short video on their Instagram page . Steven Gerrard is seen in EA Sports' video walking out of the tunnel in a LA Galaxy strip at the StubHub Center . ‘I still feel like a player. I still feel like I can perform for a number of years, so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality — a team that is used to winning but also a team that’s got people that want to win in the future,' added Gerrard. ‘Having spoken to the manager Bruce Arena and also the people above him, they’re very aggressive and they want success. ‘That’s what I want. That’s how I want to finish my career, so they are the reasons I chose LA Galaxy. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. They basically told me what I wanted to hear. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.’ EA Sports have released a video on their Instagram showing Gerrard in a LA Galaxy kit . LA Galaxy fans have scrambled to get hold of this season's shirt with 'Gerrard' on the back . Liverpool's current captain offered comfort for his adoring Anfield fans by insisting he wants to return to the club in the future. ‘My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season — and hopefully come back,' said Gerrard. ‘That’s the message: my relationship with Liverpool doesn’t end in the summer. In fact, it will never end.’ Gerrard has guaranteed LA Galaxy supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment .

"Tom Croft's World Cup prospects are in danger of being damaged by the uncertainty over his future at Leicester. The 29-year-old was forced into the role of frustrated spectator on Sunday as the Tigers beat Bath in a feisty Aviva Premiership clash at Welford Road. The veteran of 43 Tests and two Lions tours was in the stand while Jamie Gibson started at blindside flanker and Italian Robert Barbieri was preferred as the back-row replacement on the bench. England flanker Tom Croft has made only three appearances for the Tigers this season . Croft's lack of game time has partly been down to the superb form of young flanker Jamie Gibson (left) Italian Robert Barbieri (pictured in orange) has been preferred as the back-row replacement for the Tigers . NOV 28, 2009: Sidelined for six weeks after medial ligament tear against Leeds. JAN 16, 2010: Ruled out of Six Nations after grade two medial ligament injury against Viadana. NOV 27, 2010: Out for three months after fracturing right shoulder blade against South Africa. APRIL 21, 2012: Eight-month absence after suffering triple fracture of C6 vertebra against Harlequins. SEPT 11, 2013: Sidelined for rest of 2013-14 season after knee injury v Worcester. OCT 10, 2014: Ruled out of autumn Test series with recurring knee problem. After the game, Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill confirmed that Croft had been left out of the match-day 23, rather than being unavailable due to yet another injury, saying: ‘He was fit — not selected.’ So far this season, Croft has made only three appearances for the Tigers — partly due to a knee problem and partly due to the strides made by Gibson, who has excelled in his position. He only played twice in the previous campaign, which was cut short by a serious knee injury. The year before that, he was ruled out for several months after breaking his neck — a frightening setback which required major surgery. Croft is out of contract in the summer and his hopes of staying at the club where he has played throughout his professional career are in the balance. Cockerill said: ‘He needs to play. He’s only played five games in two years so he needs to play. It (non-selection against Bath) was just about fitness — as in, he’s not played.’ Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill wants Croft to stay at the club despite his injury problems . Asked if he really wanted the athletic forward to stay, Cockerill responded with a resounding ‘Yes’, but it is understood the sticking point is Leicester’s insistence that he accepts reduced terms on any new deal. Their logic is understandable in the circumstances, but it has created a stand-off. It is unclear whether other clubs have made enquiries about Croft. The implications for England are stark. If Croft is short of game time at club level, he cannot be seriously considered for a recall. He was a fixture in the first Six Nations campaign of Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach, in 2012 — delivering an astonishing, match-winning performance against France in Paris — but has not represented his country since the record defeat in Cardiff in March 2013. Croft races away for a try against the Waratahs during the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour of Australia . Months later, he made two Test appearances for the Lions, but since then his international career has been on hold. Leicester were able to confirm yesterday that Owen Williams has signed a new contract which will keep him at Welford Road for a further two years. The 22-year-old fly-half has rejected the option of a return to the Scarlets. His decision is another blow to the Welsh region, who will lose Wales stand-off Rhys Priestland at the end of the season. He has opted to join Bath — where he will largely serve as understudy to George Ford — for a salary thought to be around £300,000 per year. This is likely to spell an end to his Test career, at least in the short term, as the so-called ‘Gatland’s Law’ against picking players based abroad is due to be more strictly enforced. Croft showcases his trademark pace as he goes over for a try against France in Paris in March 2012 . Another Welshman who will be on the move in the summer is Gavin Henson. The veteran utility back has been a bit-part figure at Bath. While Sportsmail has learned there has been interest from France and Japan, it is understood the 32-year-old is more likely to stay in England, with Bristol keen to recruit him. Reports in France suggest Bath are trying to sign All Black back row Jerome Kaino.","Tom Croft was left out of the Leicester line-up for the game with Bath .

'We're delighted to be able to bring a player of Juan Pablo's calibre into the club. 'Over recent months we've seen a number of front row players unavailable for selection due to injury and international duties, and to be able to add Juan Pablo to our options in that area provides us with greater depth on either side of the scrum.

"Wales prop Rhodri Jones could miss this season's RBS 6 Nations Championship due to injury. Jones' regional team the Scarlets have confirmed that he suffered a dislocated shoulder during last Saturday's Guinness PRO12 victory over the Ospreys. The 23-year-old, who has won 13 caps, provided bench cover throughout the recent autumn Test series for his Scarlets colleague Samson Lee. Rhodri Jones stands for the national anthem ahead of the match between Wales and South Africa in November . He has become an important member of Wales head coach Warren Gatland's plans, and recently signed a national dual contract. If Jones is confirmed as facing a lengthy lay-off - he will see a specialist on Tuesday - it could open the door for 33-year-old Adam Jones gaining a Wales squad recall after he was overlooked in November. Rhodri Jones' Scarlets front-row colleague Kirby Myhill, meanwhile, suffered a suspected pectoral muscle tear during the Ospreys game. Kirby Myhill (centre) is tackled during a Heineken Cup match between Scarlets and Harlequins last year . 'Scarlets can confirm that tighthead prop Rhodri Jones sustained a dislocated right shoulder, which was relocated while on the field, and was sent for preliminary imaging on Saturday evening,' the Scarlets said in a statement. 'Hooker Myhil has a suspected pec tear and has undergone initial imaging on his right shoulder. 'Both Jones and Myhill will meet with consultant specialists today to discuss the prognosis and to put a rehabilitation plan in place.'","Rhodri Jones could miss this year's RBS Six Nations .

"Jockey Barry Geraghty has insisted he detected the same fire and racing desire burning within Sprinter Sacre as the 2013 Queen Mother Champion Chase winner stepped on a racecourse for the first time in over a year. The rider’s enthusiastic reaction was one of the reasons Ladbrokes took the dramatic reaction of slashing Sprinter Sacre’s odds of regaining the Champion Chase crown in March to 2-1 favourite from 7-2. Sponsors Betway make him a 3-1 shot. The plan now is to run Sprinter Sacre in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot on January 17. Sprinter Sacre takes place in a schooling session before returning to racing at Newbury . Geraghty spoke after riding the Nicky Henderson-trained eight-year-old for the first time since he was pulled up suffering from a fibrillating heart in the Desert Orchid Chase at last year’s Kempton Christmas meeting. Barry Geraghty was impressed by Sprinter Sacre's comeback performance . The pair worked over a mile and five furlongs of the Berkshire track, jumping five fences down the back straight before being allowed to stride clear of his lead horse, Nico de Boinville-ridden Tanks For That, up the home straight. Geraghty added that a mistake at the second fence, when Sprinter Sacre took off far too soon, was also a positive. The Irish jockey said: ‘I was meeting (the fence) a little long and Sprinter fancied it a bit and came up out of my hands. If he had put in a short stride I would be more worried. You’d have said he is not as boisterous as he was. ‘He was full of it. That is what I would have expected 13 months ago.’ Despite no repeats of the heart problem since the Kempton incident, Henderson had taken the precaution of having equine cardiology specialist Celia Marr, who has treated Sprinter Sacre, present. The trainer said he had been keen to clear any psychological hurdles Sprinter Sacre might have faced on his return to a racecourse. He added: ‘You have to bear in mind it is an horrendous experience for him. The worry is it leaves a scar. That was why we wanted this public experience. ‘It needed to be on a race day to have some atmosphere rather than coming tomorrow morning and going around on his own. ‘We had to make sure he has gone through a barrier he was comfortable with. That will surely give him confidence. He can now gallop away happily and that was the object of the exercise. He enjoyed himself which was the important thing.' The former Champion Chase winner has not raced since suffering from a fibrillating heart over a year ago . John Ferguson thinks Challow Hurdle winner Parlour Games could be the best jumper he has trained after his win over Vyta Du Roc. The gelding is 10-1 for the Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle. Henderson conceded that the path to recovery has been far form smooth adding: ‘We were struggling at the beginning of the season and it hasn’t all been that easy so far. It has taken a bit longer than you would have liked but you have to be patient. ‘We now have roughly three weeks until Ascot so has three more good pieces of work to do.’ Meanwhile, Henderson insisted he and Geraghty were satisfied with 2013 Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth despite his last place finish behind Road To Riches in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on Sunday. It was the gelding’s first run since winning the race 12 months earlier and he is now likely to head straight to the Gold Cup in March. Henderson said: ‘We were happy. Barry said he felt fantastic and jumped great but the ground was as holding as they have had it there for a long time and he doesn’t like it. ‘If he jumps as well on better ground, we are in the ball game.’ Trainer Nicky Henderson gives Sprinter Sacre a once over after a workout at Newbury . Henderson and Geraghty went on to land a double at Newbury with Clean Sheet and Top Notch. The latter strengthened the trainer’s hand in the Triumph Hurdle when beating Mick Jazz four and a half lengths despite carrying 10lb more in the juvenile hurdle. Joint owners Simon Munir and Isaac Souede are also building a formidable Triumph team which also includes Henderson’s Peace And Co and Bristol De Mai, the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained winner of the Finale Hurdle at Chepstow on Saturday.","Sprinter Sacre returned for first time since suffering from a fibrillating heart .

"Owen Williams has rejected a return to Wales with the Scarlets to sign a new contract with Leicester Tigers. The 22-year-old fly-half has completed new terms at Welford Road, understood to be a two-year deal, opting against a return to his former Welsh region. The uncapped former Scarlets playmaker's decision to continue to ply his trade outside of Wales could damage his chances of selection for this year's Rugby World Cup. Owen Williams (centre, holding ball) has signed a new contract to remain with Leicester Tigers . Leicester rugby director Richard Cockerill expects Williams and England fly-half Freddie Burns to continue battling for the Tigers' number 10 shirt. 'Owen has done an excellent job for us since he came here 18 months ago and I'm delighted that he wants to stay in the longer term and has now agreed a new contract,' said Cockerill. 'He has settled very well here and has gained experience of some massive occasions with Tigers both in Aviva Premiership and in Europe during the last two seasons. Williams kicks a penalty during Leicester's 17-8 win against Bath at Welford Road on Sunday . 'Owen has shown a great attitude to his work, and he is learning and developing his game all the time in a very tough environment, which says a lot about him. 'We have two very good, young and ambitious fly-halves in Owen and Freddie Burns, which can only be good for them as players and also for the team as a whole.' Wales coach Warren Gatland prefers his top stars to be based among the country's four regions, and would have hoped to see Williams return on a dual contract. Williams rejected a return to Wales with the Scarlets in favour of extending his stay with Leicester Tigers . The Scarlets were keen to bring Williams back to Wales given Rhys Priestland's expected move to Bath for next season. Williams joined Leicester from the Scarlets in the summer of 2013 and has already passed 300 points for the East Midlands Aviva Premiership club. Williams has been frequently tipped for a Test call thanks to his sparkling Welford Road form, but so far Wales boss Gatland has not drawn him into his national squad. A return to the Welsh regional system would have proved a clear boost to Williams' chances of claiming his first Test call this year.","Owen Williams has rejected a return to Wales and signed a new deal .

"London Welsh went down to their 12th Aviva Premiership loss of the season but they made an understrength Harlequins work far harder than they can have expected for their 24-13 victory. Welsh were much the better side in the first half but squandered numerous opportunities which allowed their opponents to undeservedly lead 12-10 at the interval. Welsh continue to compete in the second half but Quins were more clinical in taking their chances to gain victory. Karl Dickson, Marland Yarde, Kyle Sinckler and Tom Williams scored tries for the Quins with Tim Swiel kicking two conversions. Paul Rowley scored Welsh's try with Will Robinson kicking two penalties and a conversion. Harlequins winger Marland Yarde pulls London Welsh's Nick Scott up short of the line . Seb Stegmann brings the ball forward for much-improved Welsh but they trailed 12-0 at the break . London Welsh were without their captain, Tom May, who was suspended after being sent off last week. Nic Reynolds took his place, with flanker, Carl Kirwan, leading the side. There were recalls for former Quins Peter Browne and Seb Stegmann with lock Ben West making his Premiership debut. Harlequins were without a number of leading players with Chris Robshaw, Joe Marler, Care, Nick Evans, George Robson, and Mike Brown all missing from their starting line-up. They made five changes from last week's game against Northampton with Ollie Lindsay-Hague, Aseli Tikoirotuma and Dickson all recalled behind the scrum as were Joe Gray and Sam Twomey up front. London Welsh made a strong start and were twice narrowly denied the opening try. Nick Scott chased a kick ahead to collect and looked a certain try-scorer until Yarde dashed back to prevent the wing from grounding the ball. Karl Dickson crosses for Quins first try of four in the match at Kassam Stadium in Oxford . Moments later the hosts had another great opportunity but Stegmann was unable to gather a clever cross field kick from Piri Weepu, when there were no Quins defenders to challenge Stegmann. The opening period was played at a frenetic pace as both teams tried to run the ball at every opportunity with Welsh again having a great chance to open the scoring. On half-way, Seb Jewell intercepted a careless pass from Matt Hopper to race away but he did not have the legs to make it to the line as he was hauled down 15 metres short. Quins had their first chance, which they look to have taken when Yarde collected Swiel's kicked to step inside a defender and touch down but the wing had put a foot in touch so the game, despite plenty of entertainment was scoreless at the end of the first quarter. Rob Lewis kicks the ball clear from the ruck as a much-improved Welsh fall to Harlequins . After 21 minutes, Welsh deservedly opened the scoring with a superb try. Will Robinson carved the visitors' defence apart to send Scott away, with the wing running elusively to send Rowley in under the posts for the try which Robinson converted. Quins soon responded. They declined a number of kickable penalties in favour of more attacking options and were rewarded when an alert Dickson caught the home side napping to dart over for the try which Swiel was unable to convert. The home side suffered a further blow when hooker Nathan Vella was carried off on a stretcher with a leg injury to be replaced by Koree Britton. Quins also lost a player through injury with Charlie Matthews departing before a Robinson penalty extended the Welsh lead. Welsh hooker Nathan Vella receives treatment for a nasty leg injury . Vella is taken from the field on a stretcher before being replaced by Koree Britton . Two minutes before half-time, Quins took the lead for the first time when Hopper's break and neat pass sent Yarde in for the try which Swiel converted for a 12-10 half-time advantage. Robinson could have put Welsh back in front but missed a penalty but the home side remained the better side in the opening exchanges of the second half. It was therefore against the run of play when Quins score their third try when Yarde brushed aside some weak tackling to provide Sinckler with an easy run-in. Robinson kicked a penalty before Quins introduced Care, who ensured his team dominated the final 15 minutes and it was his long pass which created the bonus point try for Tom Williams.

"Eddie Howe has admitted he is 'looking forward' to travelling to Villa Park in the fourth round of the FA Cup - and well he might given Bournemouth's incredible record in Birmingham so far this season. The Cherries' solitary visit to England's second city so far this campaign saw them hammer Birmingham City 8-0 at St Andrew's in the Championship back in October. Incredibly, that result means that high-flying Bournemouth have actually scored more goals in Birmingham during the 2014-15 season than Aston Villa have throughout their whole Premier League campaign at Villa Park. Aston Villa have scored just seven Premier League goals at Villa Park so far this season . Bournemouth netted eight goals in a huge Championship victory over Birmingham City in October . Eddie Howe will take his Bournemouth side to Villa Park in the FA Cup fourth round later this month . On October 25, Bournemouth headed to St Andrew's to face Birmingham City and dished out a hammering to Bristol City. Marc Pugh scored a hat-trick, Tokelo Rantie bagged a brace, while Brett Pitman, Callum Wilson and Matt Richie also got themselves on the scoresheet. CLICK HERE to read the match report of Bournemouth's demolition of Birmingham. In 10 Premier League games at home so far this season, Villa have managed to score just seven times. They have failed to find the target in half of those matches, and have netted more than once on only two occasions. In fact, Marc Pugh - who netted a hat-trick against Birmingham - has scored more goals (three) than any Villan has at Villa Park this season. Even Tokelo Rantie, who bagged a brace in the 8-0 win, has scored the same number as Gabriel Agbonlahor (two) and Andreas Weimann (two) have at Villa Park in the Premier League this campaign. Bournemouth's Mark Pugh (centre) has scored more goals in Birmingham than any Villa player this season . Villa fans have seen just eight goals in all competitions at Villa Park so far this season . Christian Benteke has netted just once at home in the league for Aston Villa so far this campaign . Villa's only other scorers in the Premier League at home have been Ciaran Clark, Alan Hutton and Christian Benteke. And, even if you take into consideration all competitions, Villa have still only managed the same number of goals at home this season as Bournemouth netted in that game against Birmingham. A 1-0 loss to Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup second round failed to add to the tally - but Paul Lambert's men did score the only goal in a 1-0 victory against Blackpool in the FA Cup third round at the weekend. And Benteke's strike on Saturday finally allowed Villa to equal Bournemouth's tally of goals in Birmingham so far this campaign.

Lukaku looks to the skies after ending Everton's four-game losing streak with a late equaliser . Now the Belgium star is determined to fire Everton up the table and still hopes they can lift the FA Cup or Europa League this season. ‘After two games on the bench, I knew it was time to react,’ said Lukaku. ‘I wanted to show the manager how he can count on me. I wanted to show it was just a temporary thing, and now I am ready to move on and push myself to the limit. ‘I want to win silverware, I want to end up as high as we can in the league and we have five months to do that. I just want to play my best football now. ‘It’s been difficult but it’s something you all have to go through as a footballer. I just had to stay calm and focused, knowing my time would come. ‘I’ve been through a period like this before in my first year at Anderlecht. 'I was a 16-year-old and I went 10 games without scoring a goal, although I still won the league that season. 'So I knew that I needed to stay focused and not worry about anything off the pitch because I would come through it again.’ Toffees boss Roberto Martinez have been heavily criticised at times this season .

Lukaku revealed that the players have asked their manager to exploit his power by being more direct. He added: ‘We mixed up how we play a bit more against West Ham.

I asked them and we all said to the manager, “can we play a bit more direct sometimes?”. ‘We have a style of play where we keep the ball a lot, but knew we needed to take more responsibility, play to my strengths more and they did it perfectly. I tried to deliver for them and I did it.’","Romelu Lukaku struck at the death to earn Everton a FA Cup replay against West Ham on Tuesday night .

"West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has completed his loan move to QPR for the rest of the season. The 27-year-old Argentine will go straight into contention for QPR's Barclays Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday. Rangers boss Harry Redknapp is expected to continue to seek another loan recruit to bolster his frontline in the January window, despite recruiting Zarate. West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has penned a loan deal at Queens Park Rangers this month . Zarate admitted he seized the chance to 'show what I can do' in the Premier League with QPR, after a frustrating run since joining West Ham last summer. 'I am happy. I need this, I need to play and Queens Park Rangers have given me this chance to show what I can do,' said Zarate. 'The Premier League is the best in the world at this moment. 'Does my style suit the Premier League? Maybe. We will see! 'When I met the manager he told me he wanted to sign me for Portsmouth before, but in that moment I went to Lazio. But now I am here and will play for him. The Argentine was the first of nine signings made by West Ham in the summer but hasn't nailed down a spot . 'I will try to do different things with the ball, some skills to make the difference for the team, for me and for the other players. I am fit and I hope I can be involved on Saturday.' Zarate scored two goals in eight appearances for West Ham following his switch from Velez Sarsfield last summer. The former Lazio and Inter Milan forward made a strong early impression at the Hammers, but has failed to edge his way past Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia and Andy Carroll in recent weeks. Redknapp will hope Zarate can boost QPR's goal threat alongside prolific striker Charlie Austin in the Loftus Road club's Premier League survival fight. QPR boss Redknapp has labelled West Ham outcast Zarate a 'clever No 10' 'We're really pleased to bring Mauro in. He's a good footballer, someone with great ability who can play as a number 10,' said Redknapp. 'I first saw him when he was on loan at Birmingham quite a few years back and I actually tried to take him to Portsmouth back then. 'He's a more-than capable player, he's already shown that, and hopefully he can come in here and do well for us.' Redknapp looks to have missed out on signing Jermain Defoe once again, with Rangers restricted to loan recruits this month. Redknapp appears to have failed in signing Jermain Defoe from Toronto FC in the MLS . Toronto FC striker Defoe remains a target for a host of Premier League clubs, with the 32-year-old keen on a return to England. The Canadian club are holding out for a full transfer to let Defoe leave however, ruling QPR out of the running. Redknapp will continue to scout around for another loan striker this month despite bringing in Zarate however. Former bricklayer Austin is the Premier League's top English goal scorer with 12 strikes to his name this term, but Redknapp is keen not to leave his prize asset isolated. Bobby Zamora has continued to link play effectively but cannot last an entire match because of long-term and ongoing hip problems.

Galatasaray playmaker Wesley Sneijder is likely to join Juventus this January transfer window . But Juve have now entered the hunt for the Holland international and are now thought to be leading the race for the midfielder.

Pulis won his first game in charge on Saturday, a 7-0 thrashing of Gateshead in the FA Cup.

'But the truth is that we have a working relationship which I value very highly – he knows what I want without even having to ask these days. 'Jewely is someone I have known for a long time. We got to know each other on coaching courses as well as in opposition – he has massive experience and when I thought about what I wanted for this post, he fitted the bill perfectly. 'I'm delighted we have got him and I am sure the players will enjoy working with him. 'There are one or two other things we shall be putting in place over the next few days before everything is settled. 'It is never a pleasant task making changes because it always means some fellow professionals have to leave the club. I would just like to say that while I only worked with Keith, Dean and Rob for a short time, they impressed me as top lads who I wish well for the future.' West Bromwich Albion today announce the departures of senior coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely. The trio have left the club with immediate effect as Tony Pulis prepares to finalise the appointment of a new backroom staff. Director of football administration Richard Garlick said: 'The Club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure. 'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team. 'Rob joined at the start of the season and became a valued member of the coaching set-up. 'Changes in personnel are part of football life and it is obviously sad to say farewell to three popular and respected members of staff. 'We wish to thank them for their efforts and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours.' Downing became first-team coach under Roy Hodgson, in March 2011, before being elevated to Assistant Head Coach in December 2011 following the departure of Michael Appleton to become Portsmouth manager. Following Steve Clarke's departure in December 2013, Downing took the reins at The Hawthorns in caretaker capacity - his side winning one and drawing three of his five Barclays Premier League games in charge. Albion recruited Downing as Academy Under-18s coach in July 2009. He also became responsible for running the Baggies' Barclays Premier Reserve League team at the start of the 2010/11 campaign. Kelly joined Albion as Alan Irvine's Joint-Assistant Head Coach alongside Downing in June. Kiely became Albion Goalkeeper Coach in March 2010. The former Republic of Ireland man initially joined the club as a player in January 2007, helping the club to the Championship play-off final later that year. The following season he scooped the Championship's 2007/08 Puma Golden Glove thanks to his 18 clean sheets in all competitions after helping Albion clinch the title and reach and FA Cup semi-final.

"Those of us who always read newspapers from the back, often skipping the finance section, reserve the right to remain baffled by the mathematics, economics and high-stakes gambling involved. A £33million takeover bid for Rangers dismissed as not nearly enough? Sorry, but we must be missing something awfully clever in the small print of Tuesday’s announcement to the Stock Exchange. Assuming we’re not getting the Ibrox club confused with some *other* Rangers, perhaps the famous New York ice hockey franchise worth somewhere north of a billion US Dollars, the logic employed by the board – not for the first time – seems grounded in truly Orwellian doublethink. Rangers are facing financial ruin... but the board rejected Sarver's £18million bid to takeover club . This is a club never more than one final reminder away from complete and utter financial meltdown. A company reliant on emergency loans that grant certain lenders rights beyond those of mere shareholders. A corporate basket case held together by hope, bits of string and bad contracts – some of which remain to be settled. And all of this is worth *more* than the £33m Robert Sarver was willing to spend? Even if it could be argued that they’ve only officially rejected his £18m bid for a controlling stake, the £15m that would follow in pursuit of the rest of the shares surely represents a fair deal. According to the calculations of the London Stock Exchange, Rangers have a market capitalisation – shorthand for the overall value of all the shares available – of £21.18m. With another £8m required just to stay afloat and promotion to the top flight far from guaranteed, they can hardly be described as a blue-chip investment opportunity. Yet it seems that the promise of glories to come, not the bleakness of the current situation, is what counts in matters like this. Football is a game of dreams – and that applies equally to potential club owners as to the kid who pesters his parents to be taken to the game. Robert Sarver failed in his bid to buy a controlling stake of the Ibrox club . According to football insolvency expert — and former Leeds United chairman — Gerald Krasner, there is an obvious return to be had for whoever puts Rangers back on a firm footing. Krasner fears, though, that a power struggle and the absolute reluctance of those in charge – including Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, whatever the size of his actual stake – may prevent the club from fulfilling its ambitions. And he warns that, should the worst happen and Rangers slide into insolvency, the men who have so casually rejected Sarver’s offer will have some very difficult questions to answer. Krasner, whose time at Elland Road saw him temporarily stave off administration and cut debts of over £100m before Ken Bates bought his consortium out, is an insolvency expert and partner in Begbies Traynor. He told Sportsmail that the current Rangers board must be very confident of finding a serious alternative to the Sarver pitch, which may yet be revived as part of a broader takeover bid in tandem with the so-called ‘Three Bears’ and Dave King. Dave King bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club earlier this month . ‘The story of Rangers is something I’ve followed going back to when they first got into trouble, so I’m quite au fait with it,’ said Krasner. ‘The problem at Rangers, it seems to me, is that we’re not sure who is pulling all the strings. Is it Mike Ashley, is it the local directors? Unless you’ve been sitting in on the meetings, you’ll never know what goes on there. ‘As for how they can turn down an offer that is 50 per cent more than their current valuation, well it could be a negotiating tactic with an eye on this and other offers. ‘Or it could be that the powers-that-be, whoever that may be, are prepared to put more money in rather than lose control of the club. Sarver also owns NBA outfit Phoenix Suns . ‘If you get Rangers right, they will definitely be worth more than £21m. I don’t think £50m or even £100m would be an unreasonable valuation for a Rangers on a firm financial footing and doing well – even in Scotland. ‘If the current owners aren’t going to let Rangers go for £33m, that suggests they have done a sounding among shareholders – and that they’ve got an alternative plan. The board must be confident if they can turn something like that down, given the current financial troubles. ‘Looking at the Mike Ashley situation, if you’re asking me if I’d rather have Rangers than Newcastle? Well, Rangers have more potential. ‘And Mike Ashley is a shrewd nut. You may not like him but he’s a clever guy. He’s put £130m into Newcastle. Imagine if he’d put that into Rangers – he’d have a lot more in return.’ Krasner’s description of Newcastle owner Ashley as a ‘shrewd nut’ is borne out by events since he first began to take an interest in events at Ibrox. For about £2m worth of shares plus loans - not gifts but loans - totalling £3m, he has been granted a remarkable degree of influence. Even if we accept the official explanation behind the appointment of Derek Llambias as chief executive, the long-time Ashley associate apparently rising above a pack of candidates on merit alone, the fact remains that the Sports Direct tycoon’s temporary bail-out bought him the right to appoint two directors. Having already put Barry Leach on board, he still has another ace in the hole. Another close associate who can go in there and wield influence, even if he remains barred from increasing his overall stake in the club by SFA rules. As for how Ashley and the directors beholden to his largesse use their influence, well, there are some pretty extensive guidelines available to anyone interested in corporate law. Reducing the concept of fiduciary duty to something we can all understand, it boils down to this: ‘Directors must use their powers for the good of the company.’ Conflicts of interest are a definite no-no, while mention is also made of acting ‘in good faith’. In short, don’t make decisions based on what you *want* to happen, rather than what *needs* to be done. Mike Ashley appeared to increase his control as Sports Direct's Barry Leach was appointed finance director . No one is suggesting that the Rangers board have come close to breaching any rules. All Krasner points out is the need to be very certain that rejecting the Sarver bid was in the best interests of everyone. ‘There is a risk for the Rangers directors because, if they fail and go back into administration, then there is a potential for them to be accused of having caused it,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘They’ve had an offer that would have paid everybody off and put money into the club. If the company goes bust now, and I’m not saying it would, you would be saying to the directors that they had a duty to shareholders to at least put the offer to them. So it’s a bit of a gamble. ‘Directors can be liable personally if they’ve been found to have misled shareholders or if they’ve taken decisions against common sense. They must have something else in place. ‘The best result is for everyone to work together, obviously. The trouble is, when you have different blocks working against each other, football takes second place to the power struggle.’ Said struggle appears destined to continue for some time at Ibrox, as Sarver, the Three Bears, King, the Easdale brothers and Ashley are joined by a cast of smaller players now prompted to declare an interest under takeover rules. Watch this space. Do try to keep up with the, ahem, logic behind every major decision. And don’t worry if, on occasion, the sums appear to make no sense at all.","Rangers board reject Sarver's attempt to takeover at Ibrox .

"Defender James Collins maintains West Ham must not let the disappointment of failing to see off Everton in the FA Cup at Goodison Park disrupt efforts to get their Barclays Premier League campaign back on track this weekend. The Irons were moments away from the fourth round, having held on to Collins' goal at the start of the second half, before Romelu Lukaku smashed home a stoppage-time equaliser which means the two sides will now go head-to-head again in east London on January 13. On Saturday, West Ham will travel to Swansea looking to get finally end a four-match winless run which has seen Sam Allardyce's side slip down to seventh. James Collins (left) heads the ball past Joel Robles to give West Ham the lead against Everton . Romelu Lukaku (right) equalised for the Toffees late on as Roberto Martinez's side secured a replay . Collins is expecting a response against the Tigers. He told the club's website: 'Conceding is disappointing at any time, so to do it in injury-time in the FA Cup knowing we will have to play another game now is even more disappointing. 'But we played well at Everton, against West Bromwich Albion and also in the second half against Arsenal. 'We will go again at Swansea on Saturday, and they have got a couple of lads out too. We are seventh in the league and still in the FA Cup, so it is all to play for.' Allardyce hopes to have striker Andy Carroll fit from a foot injury for the trip to south Wales, and has been boosted by the news of Cameroon midfielder Alex Song's international retirement, so he will now be available rather than away at the African Cup of Nations. Collins (left), pictured celebrating his goal, is confident that West Ham will bounce back against Swansea . West Ham's players face a trip to the Liberty Stadium on Saturday before a replay with Everton next Tuesday . 'We have got a difficult task now as we have only got a few days to recover for Swansea and then we will play again on Tuesday (in the FA Cup replay) with only a few days to recover for the next Premier League game (against Hull). 'It will be tough on the lads, especially with the shortage of the squad now. 'Hopefully Andy will be back by the weekend, but lads have just got to dig in now and pick up more points, before hopefully beating Everton and getting through to the next round.' Senegal, meanwhile, have confirmed they do not now expect West Ham forward Diafra Sakho to link up with their squad for the African Nations Cup because of a back injury, and so the player is expected to stay in London for treatment. Irons midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate, however, has travelled to the Senegal camp ahead of the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, which begins on January 17.","West Ham drew 1-1 with Everton in an FA Cup third round tie on Tuesday .

"The Rangers board has rejected Robert Sarver's £18million takeover bid after claiming it does not 'adequately value a controlling interest in the Company'. It emerged on Sunday night that the owner of the NBA's Phoenix Suns wanted to buy a controlling stake in the crisis-hit Ibrox outfit. But the recent purchases of significant shareholdings by Dave King and the Three Bears group - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - soon made any such move highly unlikely. Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver has had his £18million takeover for Rangers rejected . Sarver, 53, had hoped to take a controlling stake in Rangers but the board do not feel his offer was adequate . And now the club's directors - who are still looking for emergency cash, despite announcing a £500,000 loan from football board chairman Sandy Easdale on Monday - have confirmed they have knocked back Sarver's offer. However, they have encouraged him to work with other supporters to help find a solution to Rangers' financial problems. In a 7am statement to the London Stock exchange, the board announced: 'The proposal by Mr Sarver comprises a placing of 100 million shares at 18p ('Placing') which, if approved by shareholders at a general meeting, would be immediately followed by an unconditional offer at 18p pursuant to Rule 9 of the Code. The Placing would give Mr Sarver control of Rangers. 'While the Directors welcome Mr Sarver's approach, they believe that, notwithstanding the current financial difficulties, the proposal does not adequately value a controlling interest in the Company and accordingly the resolution to approve the placing is unlikely to achieve the 75% majority required. The Directors do not intend to hold the General Meeting which would be necessary to implement the proposal. Dave King, seen here at the Liverpool vs Real Madrid match, now holds a 14.57 per cent share in the club . 'The Company is managing its cash resources carefully and will require further funding before the end of January. The Directors are in discussions with Rangers' significant stakeholders with a view to arranging finance for the Club. This is likely to comprise loans in the short term and possibly equity in the medium term. The board has invited Mr Sarver to consider participating in a similar discussion alongside other supportive shareholders.' Sarver made his offer just after Christmas after being encouraged to take a look at the ailing Glasgow giants by former Ibrox defender David Robertson - now a successful youth football director in Phoenix, Arizona. However, his chances of success were soon reduced as King and the Three Bears bought up almost 34 per cent of the club in two surprise transactions. The board voted down its own resolution nine at last month's AGM to allow shares to be handed to new investors without first being offered to existing shareholders. That meant Sarver's bid would require the support of 75 per cent of the club's stakeholders. But while the club have rejected Sarver's initial bid they will need someone to offer them help if they are to avoid a second administration event in three years. Douglas Park and the Three Bears group have also purchased 13.3 million shares in the Ibrox club . Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley remains the key figure. While his 8.92 per cent stake is not as sizeable as the likes of King's, the £3million crisis loan he handed out late last year, combined with the retail deal he controls, puts him in a position of considerable strength. He has already placed Derek Llambias - his former Newcastle manager director - on the board as chief executive and made another move on Monday as he handed the financial director's job to associate Barry Leach. That could yet put him in trouble with the Scottish Football Association - which has already charged him with breaching 'duel ownership' rules and barred him from extending his shareholding to just under 30 per cent. Sarver, though, insists he only ever had the best of intentions for the club. Mike Ashley owns Newcastle United and also has a stake in Scottish giants Rangers . In a separate Stock Exchange notice, the CEO of New York Stock Exchange-listed Western Alliance Bancorporation outlined his hopes for Rangers, saying: 'My three sons all play soccer for Davie's club. 'Initially, I'd had some of my advisors examining potential investments in teams in the English Premier League and in Spain, but Davie encouraged me to take a close look at Rangers. 'Like all Rangers fans, he's really upset about how far the club has fallen in recent years and the more we spoke, the more interested I became. 'I'd be the first to admit that I'm not a lifelong Rangers supporter, but anyone who knows me is aware that I'm a genuine sports fanatic and owning two major basketball franchises for the past decade has been an enormous privilege. 'I've spent the vast majority of my career in public companies and I'm used to working in very highly regulated environments. I understand the crucial importance of business integrity and transparency. 'Rangers fans have every right to be wary about someone showing an interest in the club they love, especially given some of the events of recent years. Rangers shareholder Sandy Easdale has given the club a £500,000 loan to stop it being wound up . 'First and foremost I believe what the club needs today is a very quick, major injection of capital to stabilise things and I can give the Rangers supporters a categorical assurance that I have the resources and ability to get this club back to its elite level. 'I'm looking forward to building a consensus amongst supporters and prominent Rangers-minded figures who have the long-term success of the club at heart. 'I've had detailed research carried out on Rangers and I'm convinced that we could take it back to the top of the Scottish game on a stable and sustainable basis.' Robertson added: 'I've known Robert for several years. He has been very supportive of our local club and has a very good reputation in the US. 'When he said he was looking to invest in football in Europe, I told him right away that Rangers could really be doing with someone with his track record. I explained how far the club has fallen, but that there was huge potential to rebuild it. 'Even though I'm now based over here, I always watch really closely how things are going at Ibrox and it's tragic to see how a club which was once a force in Europe has been brought so low. 'I can tell every Rangers fan in Scotland and abroad, if Robert Sarver is successful in becoming part of the club, he'll not rest until they are back on top again.'","Robert Sarver's bid does not 'adequately value a controlling interest'

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic could be heading back to Italy with a move to Serie A title challengers Roma, according to Corriere dello Sport. Ibrahimovic, 33, has apparently grown 'tired' of playing in the French capital since signing for Paris Saint-Germain from AC Milan in the summer of 2012. Despite scoring 64 goals in 75 Ligue 1 appearances the striker has been rumoured to want a move back to the Serie A, although Roma are yet to make contact with the player. Italian papers linked Zlatan Ibrahimovic with Roma (left) and predicted a Juventus Inter Milan battle (right) 'Convinced by the money', the Italian journal writes, the Swede was tempted to Paris by a lucrative deal with the four-time Ligue 1 champions worth around '€10million per year'. Whether Roma are able to match those wages is not beyond the realms of possibility, and with Ibrahimovic willing to give up a 'good part' of his earnings to play somewhere that makes him happy, the rumours could materialise into something more concrete. However, with Ibrahimovic turning 34 next year Rudi Garcia will need to seriously consider if he's worth the cash. TuttoSport report that Juventus and Inter Milan will battle it out for the signatures of Xeridan Shaquiri and Ezquiel Lavezzi ahead of their Serie A clash on January 6.

"Luis Suarez has the tendency to split opinion for fans and footballers alike. Whether you like him or not, there is no denying the talent the little Uruguayan possesses. However Barcelona team-mate and captain Xavi's mind is more than made up on what to think of the former Liverpool striker, who scored his first La Liga goal since joining the Catalans in July. Speaking with Spanish publication Sport, Xavi was asked what he thought about Suarez's punishment for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at last summer's World Cup. Luis Suarez has scored just three times in all competitions since his move to Barcelona in the summer . Suarez picked up his first La Liga goal for new club Barcelona in their 5-0 win against Cordoba on Saturday . 'Pharaoh' Xavi spoke exclusively with Spanish magazine Sport in Cairo about life at his lifetime club Barcelona . 'It’s really unfair. If he had to be punished for that action he was already punished, but don’t take away sporting merits. 'There are elbows that have worse intentions,' he added. With his cards on the table, lifetime Barcelona player Xavi was put on the spot when he was asked whether he'd prefer to be bitten or be victim of a leg-breaking tackle. The former Liverpool striker was given a lengthy ban after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . 'What’s worse? What has worse consequences? 'The only thing is that with a bite you know there is intent whilst with a tackle they can do damage but the intention could be to get the ball.' So what of Suarez's actual playing ability, forgetting the aforementioned baggage he brought along with him to the Nou Camp? 'He has goals in his blood. I have said that more will come. He will start scoring goals,' Xavi confirmed. 'He reminds me a bit, with his killer instinct to damage other teams, of Samuel Eto’o, that bad mood, that personality, that persistence.'

"While Diego Costa has grabbed headlines aplenty with his goals and robust style since joining Chelsea, it's another summer acquisition from Spain who has helped Jose Mourinho's side really tick so far this season. Not only did Cesc Fabregas' £30million move from Barcelona leave Arsenal fans in uproar, it also made a significant section of the Stamford Bridge faithful question their manager. The Spaniard's talent was never an issue, but how could they welcome a player with such strong connections to their London rivals into Mourinho's tight-knit camp? Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has already recorded 13 assists in the Premier League this season . Fabregas celebrates scoring a goal of his own in Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stoke just before Christmas . Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea) - 13 . Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea) - 8 . Leighton Baines (Everton) - 7 . Dusan Tadic (Southampton) - 7 . Stewart Downing (West Ham) - 6 . Angel di Maria (Manchester United) - 6 . Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) - 6 . Jesus Navas (Manchester City) - 6 . Fast forward five months and any doubts about Fabregas - or his commitment - have been well and truly banished after the Blues' brilliant first half of the campaign. Chelsea are three points clear at the top of the Premier League and have scored the joint highest amount of goals - two things Fabregas can take a huge amount of credit for. After picking a pass to Eden Hazard for the Belgian to equalise against Southampton on Sunday, the 27-year-old now has 13 assists in the top-flight this season. Not only is that the highest amount in the division, it's also five more than second-placed Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea. Swansea City midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson (right) is Fabregas' closer challenger when it comes to assists . Former Barcelona midfielder Fabregas has also created more chances than any other player this season . Cesc Fabregas - 61 . Stewart Downing - 54 . Alexis Sanchez - 51 . Dusan Tadic - 50 . Eden Hazard - 47 . Raheem Sterling - 45 . Christian Eriksen - 44 . Gylfi Sigurdsson - 42 . Santi Cazorla - 42 . Jesus Navas - 41 . Everton's Leighton Baines and Southampton's Dusan Tadic share third place with seven assists to their names, but both are a long way behind the Spain midfielder. It would be easy to assume that Fabregas has more assists because he is setting up the likes of £32m man Costa, however the numbers prove otherwise. Fabregas has created 61 chances (including assists) this season - seven more than second-placed Stewart Downing and 10 more than Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez. He is making an average of 3.33 scoring opportunities per 90 minutes since moving to Stamford Bridge, showing a staggering consistency to his game across the opening 19 fixtures. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard managed a league high of 13 assists during the 2013-14 campaign but Fabregas has already equalled that tally and we're only halfway through the season. One more and he'll jump into a tie for sixth on the all-time list of Premier League assist-makers alongside the likes of Ashley Young, David Beckham and Didier Drogba. West Ham winger Stewart Downing has created 54 chances this season - seven less than Fabregas . Steven Gerrard registered 13 assists last season but Fabregas has equalled that after just 19 games . But Fabregas won't be content with that. Thierry Henry's record of 20 assists - set for Arsenal during the 2002-03 season - is well within his reach. The Frenchman's total has stood untouched for over a decade but his former team-mate has the skill, experience and vision to smash it to pieces. In fact, if Fabregas goes on to create goals at the same rate until May, he will end up with 26 assists for the season. Costa can expect more goals and attention if his team-mate continues his current form, but it'll be Fabregas who goes down as Mourinho's most influential signing of last summer. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry holds the record for assists in one Premier League season with 20 .","Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas has 13 Premier League assists this season .

"Surrey opener Jason Roy is set to join the ranks of Kevin Pietersen in Australia's Twenty20 Big Bash League on a short-term deal with the Sydney Thunder. The 24-year-old Surrey opener will step in for England one-day captain Eoin Morgan to play under Michael Hussey at the western Sydney-based franchise on a three-match deal. Morgan's time with the Thunder comes to an end on January 1 when he'll link up with his England team-mates for the first time since the sacking of Alastair Cook ahead of their tri-series against Australia and India, and in the lead-up to the World Cup Down Under. Jason Roy has signed a three-match deal to play with the Sydney Thunder in Australia's Big Bash League . Roy's first appearance will come against Hobart Hurricanes on January 9 at Spotless Stadium. Surrey opener Roy was top-scorer in the Natwest T20 Blast last season with 677 runs at 48.36 . 'The Big Bash is a huge competition for an overseas player to be involved in,' Roy said. 'I'm looking forward to getting over there and playing in front of the big crowds with an amazing squad. 'Hopefully I can get my name out there and show people what I'm about and help win some games for the Thunder.' Roy was the top scorer in last season's Natwest T20 Blast smashing 677 runs at 48.36 and made his England debut at Edgbaston against India. Along with Hussey, the Thunder squad includes former Australia Test players Usman Khawaja, Nathan Hauritz and Andrew McDonald . Perhaps more significantly, South Africa-born Roy will be lining up alongside his childhood idol, Jacques Kallis. 'Growing up in South Africa, I watched Jacques Kallis play a lot,' said Roy. 'To be able to play alongside him is going to be an amazing experience and I'm looking forward to picking his brain along the way.' Sydney Thunder General Manager Nick Cummins said he was 'delighted' to have secured the services of Roy, a genuine rising talent in limited overs cricket. 'We are delighted to have Jason join the Thunder as Eoin's replacement,' said Cummins. Roy replaces Thunder import Eoin Morgan, who will join the England squad as captain on January 1 . The 24-year-old is particularly excited to be playing alongside boyhood hero Jacques Kallis in Sydney . 'Jason is one of the most exciting young T20 batsmen in the world and he'll add some significant firepower to our batting lineup.' He also toured with the Lions side to Sri Lanka and South Africa in the winter and will rejoin the development side in South Africa in January, meaning he will miss the Thunder's final group game on January 22. In his latest knock for the Thunder, Morgan managed just six from 11 deliveries as his side fell 16 runs short of Sydney rivals the Sixers at Stadium Australia. Riki Wessels (the Queensland-born, Nottinghamshire-based son of South Africa and Australia Test legend Kepler Wessels) top-scored for the Sixers with 50 as they set at target of 180 for 7 but it was too many for the Thunder despite a 42-ball 80 not out from Aiden Blizzard.","Eoin Morgan will join the England ODI squad on January 1 .

"Andrew Flintoff is off the mark in Australia's Big Bash League after taking two wickets for Brisbane Heat in their one-run win over the Melbourne Stars. Flintoff took a battering in the last of his four overs as Stars' left-hander Rob Quiney smashed 21 runs in his almost match-winning innings of 43 from 31 balls. That flurry made his figures of 2-41 look expensive, but his scalps - dangerous big-hitters James Faulkner and John Hastings - taken as the Stars mounted a late charge were invaluable to his side's win. Andrew Flintoff celebrates one of his two wickets for Brisbane Heat in their one-run win over Melbourne Stars . It was a marked improvement on Flintoff's first appearance for the Heat which saw a third-ball duck and his two overs going for 12.5 apiece as Michael Hussey and Jacques Kallis smashed 96 and 97 not out respectively for the Sydney Thunder. Flintoff claimed Faulkner, a figure who haunts many an international T20 side for his late-innings heroics, with a ball full on middle and off that caught a leading edge that floated to the safe hands of James Hopes at extra cover. With the last ball of that third over Flintoff went wide of the crease to Hastings, who in trying a desperate heave over mid-wicket managed only to be clean bowled. Rob Quiney crushed 43 from 31 balls, including 21 from a single Flintoff over, in Melbourne Stars' chase . Despite Quiney's heroics, the Stars fell one run short in their attempt to run down the Heats 164 for eight . Flintoff was earlier run out from the last ball of the Heat's innings as they finished with 164 for 8, with Chris Lynn top-scoring with 48 from 34 balls. Coming on first change, 37-year-old Flintoff was relatively tight as England's Luke Wright got Stars' chase off to a decent start with 33 from 23 balls before being caught by Hopes from Dan Christian. In the penultimate over of the chase, Scott Boland took a single to bring in-form Quiney on strike and the Victorian who was dumped from Australia's Test team after two matches unleashed. Stars batsman  John Hastings is bowled while attempting to heave Flintoff over midwicket . Flintoff earlier scored 15 - bettering his previous duck - before being run out from the last ball of the innings . Quiney crushed two sixes and a four (only one other boundary came from Flintoff's bowling), along with a pair of twos. Boland got Quiney on strike again with the first ball of Ryan Duffield's closing over, but Quiney could manage just one six and got three (after being dropped at midwicket) when he needed five from the last ball.","Andrew Flintoff took 2-41 after being hit for 21 runs in his last over .

"Manchester United's hopes of landing Gareth Bale have been dealt a blow after Real Madrid claimed they would never sell the forward. Louis van Gaal's side have been linked with a sensational £120million move for the Wales international, who has been a star for the Spanish side since joining the club in a world record £86million move from Tottenham in the summer of 2013. But with reports from Spain suggesting United were ready to swoop for Bale, Real president Florentino Perez claimed the 25-year-old is not for sale at any price.

"Phil Jones denied that tiredness was the main factor behind Manchester United's goalless draw at Tottenham on Sunday. Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was in fine form in the opening 45 minutes but United seemed to tire after the break, with manager Louis van Gaal naming the same side that started the 3-1 win over Newcastle less than two days previous. Jones played the whole 90 minutes in both games and the England defender insisted it was an bad luck that cost United the three points, rather than a lack of energy. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

'You have to do it, we have done it, and now we look forward to the game against Stoke on Thursday. 'We created numerous chances in the first half and perhaps should have been three or four nil up at half-time, but it wasn't to be. 'In the second half they came out and pushed us to the end.

"When Radamel Falcao smashed a devastating hat-trick past Chelsea in the colours of Atletico Madrid, we longed for his arrival in the Premier League. This was a player made for the English top-flight; pace, power, panache and potency - Falcao had the ingredients to succeed on these shores. Now he is here - after a long-term knee injury - but the Manchester United loanee is a sorry imitation of the striker who terrorised the Blues in the European Super Cup of 2012. Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao looks a shadow of his former self at Old Trafford this season . Falcao arrived in England to much fanfare but the Man Unted striker has failed to light up the Premier League . Gone are the razor-sharp reactions of mind and body. Gone also is the swagger which was deserving of his superiority, for Falcao was the best centre forward in Europe as he plundered 32 goals for Atletico in the campaign which followed his destruction of Chelsea. He was the most coveted frontman on the continent but ended up at Monaco. Money – a £52million transfer fee and £10m salary – talked. It was there that he suffered the cruciate ligament injury which robbed him of a place at the World Cup. On the evidence of his efforts for United – whom he joined in a £6m loan deal in September – that injury robbed him of a whole lot more than a summer in Brazil. Falcao terrorised the Chelsea defence playing for Atletico Madrid in the European Super Cup of 2012 . Falcao moved to Monaco from Atletico Madrid for £52million in 2013 before moving to Man United on loan . Falcao suffered a  cruciate-ligament injury following a challenging during a French Cup game in January . The striker had to leave the field on a stretcher and subsequently missed the World Cup last sunmer in Brazil . He has just two goals from 11 appearances and only now does Louis van Gaal appear to trust the 28-year-old with successive starts. He failed to break Sunday’s stalemate at Spurs and fluffed the one chance which did come his way. The energy and endeavour which was always married to his goals is on the increase, it seems, but strikers are not judged on distance run or tackles made. Rather, goals are the currency in which they trade and, to that end, Falcao’s return is poor in comparison to his sizeable wage packet. And therein lies the conundrum for Van Gaal and the United hierarchy. Falcao, pictured against Tottenham's Ryan Mason, failed to break the deadlock at White Hart Lane on Sunday . At 28, is a player whose reputation currently outweighs his return on the pitch – not to mention his salary – really worth a £50m investment to keep at Old Trafford? You would argue not. The numbers – be it age, goals, fee or wages – do not make business sense. Better, it seems, already reside within the club. Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have eight goals apiece this term, while playmakers Juan Mata and Angel di Maria have also outscored Falcao. Then there is James Wilson, the academy product who broke all manner of scoring records at youth level and is nine years Falcao’s junior. James Wilson has broken all manner of scoring records at youth level and has impressed for the first-team . The beauty of the loan agreement is that it serves as a ‘try before you buy’ scenario for United. Thus far, he has struggled for form and fitness, never a favourable combination. He has five months to persuade his manager and the paymasters at the club that he is worth such a monstrous outlay. For supporters – those of United and perhaps even beyond – there is the hope that Falcao will come good, that he will unleash that devastating streak which did for Chelsea two years ago and won him so many admirers in this land. That following, however, is fading fast, as are his chances of remaining at United.","Radamel Falcao has struggled at Manchester United having returned to full fitness after serious injury .

"New signing Salomon Kalou struck twice to help Hertha Berlin edge past VfB Stuttgart 3-2 on Friday and climb to 12th in the Bundesliga.

"One summer signing is flying, but Swansea City will perhaps be more focused on the one who was crying. What a loss Jefferson Montero will be to this side if the hamstring injury that wrecked his afternoon proves to be serious. It was the rapid winger who made the only goal of the game for Gylfi Sigurdsson and the same little man who gave Jores Okore the kind of twisting, turning runaround that leads to a sleepless night. Not bad for 22 minutes of work. But then his hamstring went and turned a game that was looking one-sided into something far more even.

CLICK HERE for all the stats, goals - including Gylfi Sigurdsson's heat map (above) He left the pitch in tears and with a salute from Sigurdsson, who represents the best of Garry Monk’s summer spending but is being pursued in that particular contest by the Ecuadorian with the fast feet. On that score, Lukasz Fabianski is none too shabby either and his late saves meant Paul Lambert’s side suffered only their second league defeat in eight games. Lambert could barely believe it; Monk bristled at the subsequent suggestion his side got away with it. ‘I don’t feel fortunate at all,’ he said. ‘We were the better team.' Perhaps his answer was coloured by thoughts of Montero. ‘It wasn’t good when he was holding his leg we will scan him and hopefully it is not serious,’ Monk said. ‘We will find out in the next 24 hours if it is serious, but I really hope not because he has been fantastic for us.’ How Lambert could use a bit of that creative spark. Here, it was the obvious omission from a side that had the best of the possession and a number of reasonable chances, but left with nothing tangible. Lambert, the architect of numerous recent changes to this side’s style, drew the comparison to Swansea’s passing game, but it will not be lost on him that Villa struggled with a problem that has often in past seasons affected the team they were playing – how to turn passes into goals. Sigurdsson celebrates after scoring a fabulous free-kick past American goalkeeper Guzan . Swansea midfielder Jefferson Montero was forced off in the 22nd minute after picking up a hamstring injury . ‘I am proud of them for the way they played,’ Lambert said. ‘We did to Swansea what they do to most teams here. We out-passed them. ‘We have changed the way we play and the lads are enjoying their football. Sometimes you lose and say we deserved nothing. But I go away from here disappointed to lose but delighted by the football.’ Words echoed by many Swansea managers in previous seasons, though not so much in this increasingly promising campaign. So much of that is down to cutting edges like Montero and Sigurdsson. On a soaked, slow pitch, Montero was somehow producing one of his finest performances of the season. The left winger was repeatedly picked out by team-mates with the sole intention of setting him free against Okore. Villa hardly helped themselves by deploying Alan Hutton so far up the field as a wing-back and in the extra space Montero tormented Okore. Within minutes of the start he had beaten him on the inside and out. For good measure, the 5ft 7in winger also beat Hutton to a cross and headed over, before winning the free-kick that Sigurdsson used to put Swansea ahead on 13 minutes. Montero had collected the ball on the left and beaten Hutton and Fabian Delph before Okore brought him down outside the area. Sigurdsson’s free-kick for his third goal of the season was brilliant. Wilfried Bony celebrates scoring a goal that was later disallowed during the Premier League encounter at the Liberty Stadium . Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph comes away with the ball after evading a challenge from Sigurdsson . Sadly for Swansea, Montero’s game was soon up. He had just slalomed through a crowd of Aston Villa defenders and pulled back a cross for Wilfried Bony when his hamstring pinged. That incident took hefty pressure off Villa and they improved. Christian Benteke went close with a free-kick and Aly Cissokho could not improvise enough to turn in a bouncing cross from Tom Cleverley. Their cause was helped by Ashley Williams missing an easy header and Jonjo Shelvey having one of those days when his mind seemed elsewhere. The 22-year-old’s talent is not in dispute, though for how long can that - and his age - be a robust defence against his inconsistency and errors of thought? The unnecessary decision to pull down Agbonlahor in the first half illustrated the point. He was booked and then substituted for Tom Carroll early in the second half. Villa brought on Andreas Weimann at half-time and the extra attacking threat caused yet more pressure. Gabriel Agbonlahor had a reasonable shout for a penalty ignored and Weimann also scuffed a decent opening before a Fabianski save from Benteke at the death rescued Swansea. Lambert suggested Villa deserved better and left as a defeated manager with a beaming smile; Monk pointed out that Ki Sung Yueng had an equally good chance to get a second for Swansea.

"Any Premier League clubs hoping to lure Jurgen Klopp to England were dealt a blow after Borussia Dortmund reiterated that the club has full faith in their under-pressure manager. Klopp guided Dortmund to Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 but has struggled this season with 10 defeats from 17 games - leaving the former champions second-bottom in the table going in to the winter break. Nonetheless, general manager Hans-Joachim Watzke told the Bild paper on Tuesday: 'We are fully convinced of him.' Jurgen Klopp has been backed by Borussia Dortmund, despite his dismal start to the season . Borussia Dortmund go in to the Bundesliga winter break sitting second bottom in the table . Watzke went on to say that he has 'zero point zero doubts' that Klopp still controls the dressing room and dismissed introducing a deadline to lift the team to safety as 'perverse' saying the 47-year-old's position would not change. Following a crisis meeting with Klopp and sporting director Michael Zorc, Watzke said: 'There are zero doubts. We are totally convinced of him. A few weeks ago he was praised into the skies, and the very same people now say that his time is over. I think that's just embarrassing.' The general manager also hinted the manager would be backed in the January market where players who were not fully committed would be replaced. 'It's not ruled out that we'll do a bit in the next few days,' Watzke told Bild - adding that 'there are no taboos in the other direction as well.'

"Before the 18 Bundesliga clubs can catch their breath over a six-week winter break, they have one final game which may determine how relaxing that break is going to be. Disregarding the runaway league leaders Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga has split in half with all clubs either in the hunt for a place in Europe next season, or fighting to avoid relegation. Seven sides are packed within five points below second-placed Wolfsburg while nine sides are grouped within the same number of points at the bottom of the table.

That group includes Borussia Dortmund, who head to bottom-placed Werder Bremen on Saturday aware that another defeat - their seventh on the road this season and 10th overall - could see them propping up the rest of the division leading into 2015. Coach Jurgen Klopp hopes that will not be the case, but for the first time in his most difficult season at the club, he has hinted that he may have to consider stepping aside. ""The time will come in my life when I am no longer coach of this team, but what I know now that I will most definitely miss, and what is absolutely extraordinary, is the way the fans have supported us,"" Klopp said after his side were held to a 2-2 draw by Wolfsburg in midweek. ""It's just fantastic. There are plenty of stadiums in the world with great atmospheres, but not when you are 16th in the standings."" Klopp tried to clarify that statement on Thursday when he said it was not by any means preparation for his resignation. He said he hopes that day will come later rather than sooner, ""but not so late that I am no longer in a fit state to have any memory of the good times here.

Werder Bremen experienced more misery after their 4-1 loss to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday . On Sunday, the last of those strugglers - Freiburg - will bring the curtain down on the Bundesliga action for 2014 aware of that they need against Hannover to ensure a more relaxing festive period. At the business end of the table, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Monchengladbach are both vying for third place with goal difference currently the only thing separating them.

"Lionel Messi's future at Barcelona has been thrown into doubt once more and club legend Hristo Stoichkov believes the Argentina international could leave the Nou Camp. Having missed Barcelona's Christmas open-training session on Monday, the club claimed Messi was suffering from gastroenteritis but reports in the Spanish press suggested the No 10 has argued with manager Luis Enrique twice since returning from his winter break in Argentina. Messi was left out of Barcelona's starting XI for the trip to Real Sociedad on Sunday as the Catalan giants lost 1-0 to David Moyes' side. Lionel Messi could leave Barcelona 'through the back door', according to Hristo Stoichkov . Messi shakes hand with opposing manager David Moyes after the final whistle in San Sebastian . Stoichkov, who spent two seasons at Barcelona between 1996 and 1998, believes the club have regularly been unable to handle big-name  players who hail from outside of Catalonia. Speaking to radio show Al Primer Toque, Stoichkov said: 'They have not known how to look after Messi. 'Tell me any foreign player who has not ended up leaving Barca through the back door.' Messi (second left)  has reportedly fallen out with Luis Enrique and started on the bench against Sociedad . Neymar, along with Messi, was also allowed to return late from the winter break but Stoichkov insists neither were to blame for Sunday's defeat in Anoeta. The ex-Bulgaria international said that neither Messi nor Neymar, who was also allowed return late from their winter break and then left out of the starting XI in Anoeta, were to blame for the defeat. 'Messi and Neymar are not the guilty parties, but those who gave them holidays,' 'All players should be treated equally. If you give two days extra holidays, then play them and they get injured, that's a disaster.'

"Super League bosses hope to stage a one-off fixture in London as early as 2016 as they aim to raise the profile of rugby league in the capital. Rugby league chiefs have seen their union counterparts successfully stage club matches at Twickenham in recent seasons and they hope to follow suit - albeit on a smaller scale initially. 'I suspect it will be a long time before we're doing it on the scale that Premier Rugby does,' Super League general manager Blake Solly told the Yorkshire Post. Super League bosses are keen on raising the profile of Rugby League in London . A crowd of 77,914 were at Wembley to watch Leeds defeat Castleford in the 2014 Challenge Cup final . 'But I am reasonably confident that we'll have two big Super League sides playing in London in 2016 or, if not, certainly 2017. 'A Wigan v St Helens or Leeds Rhinos v Hull FC match would be attractive there; I don't see why in the future we can't see a game like that which draws huge amounts of people to it as a one-off event.' Wembley, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, West Ham's Olympic Stadium, Queens Park Rangers' Loftus Road and Fulham's Craven Cottage have been mooted as potential venues. The capital, of course, is without a Super League presence for the first time since its inception in 1996 after the London Broncos were relegated at the end of last season. The Challenge Cup final has been staged at Wembley every year since 2007, with the 2014 showpiece between Leeds and Castleford attracting a crowd of 77,914.

Wigan Warriors have released forward Eddy Pettybourne for personal reasons . Pettybourne said: 'I have enjoyed my time here but sometimes things happen outside your control and this means I have to head back home.' Pettybourne's Wigan career got off to an inglorious start as he incurred a one-match ban for a high tackle in February's World Club Challenge.

He has also been with the Warriors squad at a winter training camp in the US but the club have now agreed to his release.

'Being away allowed us to have some deep conversations and in the circumstances it is clearly best for Eddy to cut short his stay and return home to Australia.' Coach Shaun Wane said: 'He has fitted really well into the Wigan way and I personally am very sorry to see him leave but totally understand his reasons for doing so. 'We are a strong family-orientated club and will support Eddy in the future. I wish him the best of luck.'","Wigan Warriors have released forward Eddy Pettybourne .

He has so far posted nine photos and has gained more than 120,000 followers. In addition, he has more than 405,000 followers on Twitter and nearly eight million on Facebook. The former athlete is believed to have watched his side triumph over Kentucky 44-40 at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium in the comfort of his own Louisville home. The team is now bound for a bowl game. In October, Ali's Parkinson's disease - from which he has suffered for 30 years - was said to have deteriorated so much that he could barely speak or leave the house. The rumors grew after the star was deemed too ill to attend the Hollywood premier of a film about his life. His condition had already meant he had not been able to take part in the production of the movie. At the time, his brother Rahman, 71, who attended the screening of I Am Ali in Hollywood, told The Sunday People: ‘I have not been able to talk to my brother about this because he is sick.

He has given this film his blessing.’ But several days later, Ali took to Twitter to dispel the rumors, posting a selfie of himself smiling alongside two women at the Boar's Head is a 573-acre country estate in Charlottesville, Virginia. Alongside the image, he wrote: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today at @BoarsHeadResort. #AliSelfie.' His daughter, Hana, 38, and half-sister Maryum, 46, also spoke out to deny rumours the star was unable to speak, bedridden and close to death. They simply said he was 'doing fine'.

Denial: As rumors of his ill health spread, Ali took to Twitter to dispel them, posting this selfie of himself smiling alongside two women at the Boar's Head is a 573-acre country estate in Charlottesville, Virginia . Feeling good: He wrote: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today at @BoarsHeadResort. #AliSelfie' His famous line that he would 'float like a butterfly, sting like a bee' came in the build-up to that fight, after which he declared himself 'The Greatest'. He held the belt until 1967, by which time he had converted to Islam and named himself Muhammad Ali, when he was stripped of the title for refusing to fight in Vietnam. He made a comeback and in 1974 knocked out George Foreman in the eight round of the Rumble in the Jungle to become world champion for the second time. He held the title for four years before unexpectedly losing to Leon Spinks in 1978, but defeated him in Las Vegas months later. Nicknamed the Louisville Lip for his wit, Ali remained active for several years after his diagnosis and made a moving appearance at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games where he lit the flame. However, the sporting icon, who retired from boxing after suffering several strokes, was seen looking particularly thin and frail at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony. Donning a white suit and trainers, he was helped across the stage by wife Lonnie. In February 2013, Ali's brother Rahman said the former boxer was so crippled by the degenerative brain condition that has afflicted many ex-boxers, he might not survive until the summer.

He also claimed the family had been barred from seeing Ali, who is estimated to be worth more than £50million, and could only speak to him on the phone. Mr Rahman said his brother was ‘a prisoner in his own home’ and he is being gravely mistreated by his wife because ‘she is more interested in Ali's money than his well-being’. However, Ali’s daughter May May said she had spoken to her father that morning and he was fine, watching the Super Bowl at home in Arizona wearing a Baltimore Ravens jersey. 'He's fine, in fact he was talking well this morning,' she said in a telephone interview with CBS at the time. 'These rumors pop up every once in a while but there's nothing to them.'

"The Rugby Football League will from now on allow clubs an extra interchange in the event of a player needing a pitchside concussion assessment. It is one of four rule changes that will come into effect in the First Utility Super League, Kingstone Press Championship and League 1 and Challenge Cup in the 2015 season. The RFL said: 'The change is designed to safeguard players against the unseen dangers of concussion by removing any sub-conscious pressure on medical staff to not be over-cautious in removing a player from the field for an assessment.' The four law changes aim to make life easier for referees and 'enhance the matchday experience' Currently, each team can make a total of 12 changes during the match. The RFL's Laws Committee has also tried to clear up the confusion over obstruction, which will let the referee 'allow play to continue unless the defending team has been materially disadvantaged'. On-field officials must now also signal for a decision before going to the video referee, who would then have to find 'sufficient evidence' to overturn the ruling, a system that was used in the NRL and the international Four Nations tournament. Referees will also have only four rather than seven main areas in which sin-binning is deemed to be the appropriate course of action, helping the official reduce the number of 'on report' decisions. St Helens will attempt to defend their title after winning last season's Grand Final against Wigan . RFL chief executive Nigel Wood, who chairs the Laws Committee, said: 'The changes will enhance the matchday experience for players, spectators, coaches and TV viewers alike by making the laws of the game as simple and unambiguous as possible. 'The Laws Committee took into consideration views from across the game and I am sure the changes will be well received by everyone involved.'","RFL wants to encourage medical staff to be cautious with head injuries .

"New Zealand scrum-half Shaun Johnson has capped a memorable 12 months by winning the 2014 Rugby League World Golden Boot - seeing off the challenge of union convert Sam Burgess for the honour. The New Zealand Warriors playmaker, who broke England's hearts with a last-minute try and conversion in the semi-finals of the 2013 World Cup, produced a man-of-the-match performance in the 2014 Four Nations Series final in Wellington last month as the Kiwis defeated Australia to lift the title - a performance that impressed the 13-man Golden Boot voting panel. For the second successive year, English forward Burgess - who swapped South Sydney for Bath in October - came second in the voting but, whereas 12 months ago Burgess was within seven points of Johnathan Thurston, this time Johnson was a decisive winner, collecting almost twice as many points as his nearest rival. Johnson becomes only the fourth New Zealander to win the prestigious award, following in the footsteps of Hugh McGahan, Stacey Jones and Benji Marshall. Shaun Johnson has capped a memorable 12 months by winning the 2014 Rugby League World Golden Boot . Johnson said: 'Being a rugby league fan growing up, I always knew about the Golden Boot award. 'I was pretty aware of the players who'd won it before because they were players that I grew up watching like Stacey Jones and Andrew Johns. Then there were the current players that I admire like Thurston. To receive it is pretty unreal to be honest. 'I felt I finished the year really well and was able to take that into the Four Nations and was really happy with how I played for the Kiwis. 'It was just made easy by the culture that we have there now and the group of players that we have around us. There's no way I could have received this award without those boys playing their part, and I'll accept it on their behalf.' The panel of 13 judges comprised representatives from Australia, England, France and New Zealand, including former Golden Boot winner Garry Schofield, ex-Great Britain coach Brian Noble and past Kiwi internationals Robbie Hunter-Paul and Daryl Halligan. On a six-man shortlist. Johnson claimed 44 points, Burgess 23, with James Graham third on 18 and Greg Inglis fourth with 17. Double winner Thurston - who missed the Four Nations through injury - polled 13 points and Kiwi prop Jesse Bromwich two. Johnson becomes only the fourth New Zealander to win the prestigious award, following in the footsteps of Hugh McGahan, Stacey Jones and Benji Marshall . 'As is always the case with the Rugby League World Golden Boot, we asked the judges to consider the performances on the international stage first and foremost, and it's undeniable that Shaun Johnson had the biggest impact at that level in 2014,' RLW editor Gareth Walker said. 'Throughout the entire tournament he provided a devastating mix of organising the New Zealand side and producing moments of individual brilliance himself.' The Kiwis' Four Nations triumph is reflected in the selection of a record number of players in the world team of the year - six. Dean Whare lines up at centre with Manu Vatuvei flanking him on the wing, with Johnson in the halves. Bromwich, Kevin Proctor and Simon Mannering pack down in the mythical side.

Don’t ask them because they won’t like it,’ Jardine said. ‘In the Netherlands, the age is 18 to get your driving licence, so it is going to be a huge story.’ Verstappen, though, clearly has the confidence to deal with his big challenge. ‘I’m not that worried about it,’ he said. ‘The cars are really safe.

Hamilton is just 11 points behind Rosberg — who leads the championship on 202 — with eight races to go, the pair having opened up a sizeable lead on the rest of the field. ‘When I was racing against Kimi Raikkonen (in 2007) and Felipe Massa (in 2008), they were in a different team and their cars had different strengths and weaknesses to my car,’ Hamilton said. ‘Now I’m racing against a guy who has the same car as me — we both have access to the same data and feedback. ‘It’s a bit like playing poker — you have a set of cards and the other guy is not supposed to know what you’ve got, but Nico and I can see each other’s cards, so it’s more difficult to beat each other.’","16-year-old Max Verstappen is joining Toro Rosso for the 2015 season .

"James Bond goes into battle with invisible cars and guns that recognise his own hand. In 1942, the gadgets dreamed up by Britain’s secret services were a little more primitive. For their time, however, they were probably equally impressive to those whose lives depended on them. The 1942 classified catalogue contains top secret designs for such covert equipment as playing cards that, when placed together, form a map. Fewer than 100 of the manuals were printed . The gadgets were placed in food parcels and sent to British PoWs in camps such as Colditz or the 'Great Escape' prison, Stalag Luft III . Tiny compasses hidden inside buttons . or gold teeth, a map of Germany in a pack of playing cards, and a camera . concealed in a cigarette lighter are among the secret weapons listed in . a highly classified catalogue that has just come up for auction. Many were the brainchild of . Christopher Hutton, who had a similar role to Q in the Bond films. He . worked for the government’s secret MI9 agency, set up to help resistance . fighters and escapees. The inventions in the catalogue, . compiled to teach US intelligence officers the secrets of British . espionage, were hidden in food and supply parcels delivered to British . PoWs by the Red Cross. Some of the fascinating gadgets include maps of Germany printed on silk, so they didn't rustle, which could be crammed inside pencils, vinyl records, cigars and pipes . Christopher Hutton's kits are credited with helping 316 escape attempts from Colditz which saw 32 men return home . The rare copy of the book, Per Ardua Libertas - Liberty Through Adversity - was a dummy version retained by the London printing company . They included pencils and cigars which . concealed maps of Germany printed on silk so they wouldn’t rustle when . unravelled. Hacksaws were hidden inside dart boards and tiny radio . receivers were concealed in cigar boxes. Fewer than 100 of the 76-page . booklets, called Per Ardua Libertas (Liberty Through Adversity), are . believed to have been printed. One dummy version kept by the . printers, the London-based Sun Engraving Company, was inherited by a . Devon man, who is now selling it through auction house Bonhams, with a . pre-sale estimate of £800. The document, described as an exceptionally . rare find, includes a page explaining how the top layer of a set of . playing cards could be removed to reveal the pieces for a map of Europe. Other inventions included service . uniforms and boots that could be converted into civilian suits and . shoes. The agents also designed a white cotton handkerchief which, when . dropped into a special chemical, revealed a map of Germany. Many of the maps included instructions for escaping from a specific camp. Other notes told soldiers: ‘If pursued on open mountains, make for the loose rocks which can be rolled and avoid solid rock. ‘Besides the cover, one near miss with a 10lb rock will often scare off a man.’ Prisoners play volleyball in Colditz . Around 135,000 British PoWs were held by Germany in camps such as Colditz (above) in WWII. Most . were treated relatively well, as both nations were signatories to the . Geneva Convention (1929) and the Red Cross had access to camps. Officers were never made to work, and other ranks were usually compensated for forced labour. This relatively humane treatment resulted in a  3.5 per cent death rate . among British PoWs in German camps, the lowest of any Allied nation. Most .

"The 18-year-old Muslim extremist who was shot dead by police in September has been confirmed as a follower of controversial Islamic preacher Junaid Thorne. Numan Haider was killed by police after he stabbed two police officers from the when he was informed by his parents that police had visited their home and searched his room. The Melbourne teenager arrived at Endeavour Hills police station for an 'amicable discussion' when he stabbed one officer in the neck, face and arm, and another in the forearm, before they opened fire. Junaid Thorne, a Perth-based Islamic fundamentalist, publicly denounced the police in the aftermath of the stabbing, and has confirmed that Haider had attended several of his sermons prior to the incident. Scroll down for video . Numan Haider was reportedly a follower of controversial Muslim preacher Junaid Thorne . 18-year-old Haider was also said to be planning a trip to Iraq and Syria, and had his passport cancelled by the government just prior to his death . The 18-year-old was shot outside Endeavour Hills police station by police officers . Mr Thorne told the ABC that Haider had visited the Al Furqan Centre in Melbourne but that they had never been alone. 'One on one, he never asked me for personal advice,' he said. 'If you were to attend my lectures for example and we'd sit together after the lecture it would always be with a group of people.' Haider had been under investigation for his radical views for at least three months prior to his death, and his passport was cancelled out of concern he might attempt to travel to Syria, but was not considered an imminent threat by police. Officers had visited his house and spoken to his parents about his behaviour, according to reports, and the officers offered to shake hands in the seconds before he launched the attack. Commissioner Ken Lay said there was evidence suggesting Numan Haider had discussions with other people prior to the stabbing. 'There’s some information that he was certainly talking to other people around the time,' Mr Lay said. In a Facebook post, Thorne claimed Haider had his passport cancelled without cause and police were at his house before he was shot outside Endeavour Hills police station . Mr Thorne refused to answer questions on his support for Islamic State, claiming that it was a controversial issue . 'It's certainly something we're pushing.' 'Having said that, there were some really worrying pieces about this young man's behaviour that we are working through'. Mr Thorne publicly criticised the actions of police following the death of Haider, claiming they had provoked him to act after visiting his home. 'We know the Government was pushing for something or for an excuse to pass these anti-terror laws – so he could've been used as a scapegoat,' he said. In a Facebook post, Thorne claimed Haider had his passport cancelled without cause and police were at his house before he was shot outside Endeavour Hills police station. 'We understand that the local authorities had canceled the passport of this young boy for no reason, keeping him a captive in his own country for no valid purpose.' 'This boy was not a casualty if an armed heist, nor was his death the result of some drug deal that went wrong, rather he was killed by the same people who are supposed to be protecting his country.' Mr Thorne refused to answer questions on his support for Islamic State, claiming that it was a controversial issue. Pictures from a helicopter show a man's body lying in a car park where the confrontation occurred . Police carried bags of evidence away from the crime scene where the police officers were stabbed . 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them [Islamic State], I would get in trouble,' he said. 'If I was to say that [I] don't support them at all, that would be untrue. I may support them [on] certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.' The preacher denied that Haider had attempted to talk to him about joining rebel groups in the troubled region of the Middle East. 'Anyone that approaches me asking advice about going overseas, I automatically would alienate that person because I wouldn't trust anyone that asks me stuff like that,' he said. Mohamed Ibrahim, who shared a room with 18-year-old Haider at a Mulsim youth camp last year, told the ABC's PM program: 'He was a gentle, soft spoken young boy and when I heard the report yesterday about a man who had been shot - when I actually found out he was Numan - I was absolutely shocked.' 'There were no hints that he was part of a group, there were no signs that he was someone we should be worried about,' Mr Ibrahim said. The friend also revealed he was stunned at how much the teenager had changed. 'I think him, from going to being an inquisitive young lad to being someone who was drawn towards these kind of ideas, it's something we need to take seriously,' Mr Ibrahim said. Mr Thorne travelled around Australia this year giving a series of lectures in Islamic centres which are known for hardline interpretations of the Koran, creating controversy when he called Jews and Christians 'filthy rapists'. He claimed that he had been misunderstood, and that the quote was a 'bad excerpt' from his lectures. 'If you go back to the lecture, I said we have our sisters being raped by filthy Jews and Christians. So I'm talking about the ones that actually do that.' Mr Thorne said that the members of the Islamic centres he lectured at, including the iQraa Islamic centre in Brisbane, Al Risalah in Bankstown, and Al Furqan in Melbourne, where Haider had visited, should not be considered extremists. 'I've had the pleasure of meeting these people personally and I know what they stand for,' he said. 'They may have views that are different from others but it doesn't mean they have to be branded as extremists or as radicals or those people that want threat to the Australian community, that's not true at all.' 'We still ask and wonder, why deadly force was immediately used against a teenager, who was provoked in the first place and forced in to such a situation,' said Mr Thorne. 'The Abbot (sic) government has succeeded in creating division amongst our community based on religion,' Thorne posted. He also said the stabbed teenager was a 'wonderful, practicing (sic) young brother' – and described incident as 'murder'. 'It is a time of grief for us Muslims,' Thorne told Daily Mail Australia . According to the Herald Sun, the teenager had been seen handing out brochures at nearby Dandenong Shopping Plaza, trying to convert others to Islam. He was apparently seen there with four others last Thursday, wearing camouflage pants while holding a black and white flag. Haider's parents pleaded with their son to stay home the night he was killed, the ABC reported. Forensic police at the scene in Melbourne where Haider was shot dead by police after allegedly stabbing two officers . Assistant Police Commissioner Luke Cornelius (left) said police had no choice but to shoot the teenager . They were apparently concerned for his safety, but despite this he went to meet police - who he called when he was outside the station as he did not want to meet them inside. Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius said: 'Our members had no inkling this individual posed a threat to them and as far as we were concerned it was going to be an amicable discussion about that individual's behaviour,' 'It is also clear to us that (the) individual has, without any warning, produced a knife and assailed them with a knife,' he said. 'It's absolutely clear to us our members had no choice but to act in the way they did.' Victoria Police Commissioner Ken Lay told reporters the AFP officer, aged 43, suffered multiple stab wounds to his face, neck and abdomen. He underwent surgery and was in a serious but stable condition in hospital. He has a wife and two children. Witnesses told the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday night Haider had been yelling insults about Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Australian government. The bomb squad examined the man's car and the police station following the incident. Last night, police said they believe the man was 'acting on his own' but could not comment on his motivations. Mr Cornelius said the Victorian officer fired the single shot that killed the man.","Numan Haider was shot dead by police in September after he stabbed two police officers .

"The migration of early humans out of Africa went further and higher than previously thought. The new theory is based on discoveries suggesting that the inhabitants of Easter Island had contact with people in South America, who built the highest Stone Age village in the world. The camp in the southern Peruvian Andes was built at 4,500 metres above sea level (masl) and experts say the site dates high-altitude human habitation nearly a millennium earlier than previously documented. A rock shelter in the southern Peruvian Andes was built at 4,500 metres above sea level and experts say the site dates high-altitude human habitation nearly a millennium earlier than previously documented. Cunchaicha rock shelter is pictured . In the face of cold temperatures, high solar radiation and low oxygen conditions, hunter-gatherers managed to colonise the remote, treeless landscapes about 12,000 years ago - within 2,000 years of humans arriving in South America. The Pucuncho archaeological site revealed 260 formal tools, such as projectile points and unifacial scrapers up to 12,800 years old. Archaeologists from the University of Maine said that Cuncaicha rockshelter, which includes two alcoves at 4,480masl, contains contains a ‘robust, well-preserved and well-dated occupation sequence’ up to 12,400 years old. In the face of cold temperatures, high solar radiation and low oxygen conditions, hunter-gatherers managed to colonise the remote, treeless landscapes about 12,000 years ago - within 2,000 years after humans arrived in South America. An image if the inhospitable Pucuncho Basin is pictured . The Pucuncho archaeological site revealed 260 formal tools, such as projectile points, nondiagnostic bifaces and unifacial scrapers up to 12,800 years old. Here, archaeologists  excavate the Cuncicha rock shelter . A new genetics study of indigenous Easter islanders suggests that early Polynesians did manage to cross the Pacific Ocean completely. It found that they share DNA sequences with Native Americans, hinting that the two groups had been in close contact and interbred, before the arrival of the first Europeans. Experts from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, analysed the DNA of 27 native Rapanui people and found that their genomes on average were 76 per cent Polynesia, eight per cent Native American and 16 per cent European. It's accepted that the Americas were first colonised by people crossing from Asia via the Bering Strait - a land bridge to Alaska. Some scientists had suggested a second colonisation from the east and this study supports this theory. They believe that it was probably used as a base camp, because the rock shelter has good views of wetlands and grasslands, rock art and sooted ceilings, suggesting fires were once lit there. Most of the tools recovered at Cuncaicha were made locally from rocks such as obsidian, andesite and jasper and hint at the type of hunting and butchering that would have taken place on the plateau. Bones at the site indicate that the Stone Age hunters ate vicuña and guanaco camelids - who belong to the llama family - as well as taruca deer, according to the study, published in the journal Science. The archaeologists believe that Pucuncho Basin was a high-altitude oasis for hunting as it was filled with herds of vicuña and later, alpacas and llamas. Evidence suggests the site was occupied for a long time. Sonia Zarrillo, of the University of Calgary, Canada, told The Independent: 'We don't know if people were living there year round, but we strongly suspect they were not just going there to hunt for a few days.' 'There were possibly even families living at these sites, because we've found evidence of a range of activities.' While the basin could have been called home for the entire year, experts think that wet-season storms, the dangers of hypothermia and the need to collect plants and meet other people, may have encouraged ancient settlers to make regular journeys to lower ground. Experts believe that high altitude rock shelter was probably used as a base camp, because the it has good views of wetlands and grasslands, rock art and sooted ceilings, suggesting fires were once lit there. Here, archaeologists search for stone tools at the Cuncaicha rock shelter . The discovery of some tools support this theory because some seem to be polished by streams, which means that the hunters must have visited high-energy rivers at lower elevations. It is unclear whether the high-altitude human settlement required genetic or environmental adaptations. But with evidence of high-altitude human habitation almost 900 years earlier than previously documented, the implication is that Pleistocene humans may have evolved greater physiological capabilities. ‘The Pucuncho Basin sites suggest that Pleistocene humans lived successfully at extreme high altitude, initiating organismal selection, developmental functional adaptations and lasting biogeographic expansion in the Andes,’ the researchers wrote. ‘As new studies identify potential genetic signatures of high-altitude adaptation in modern Andean populations, comparative genomic, physiologic and archaeological research will be needed to understand when and how these adaptations evolved. Kurt Rademaker, visiting assistant professor at the university, said: ‘The study of human adaptation to extreme environments is important in understanding our cultural and genetic capacity for survival.’ The discovery of some tools found near the ancient shelter sugests that materials were colected from lower altitudes, because some seem to be polished by streams, which means that the hunters must have visited high-energy rivers at lower elevations .","Camp in the  Peruvian Andes was built at 4,500 metres above sea level .

"Outspoken Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne has penned another furious tirade. But this time, the man who once branded Australian law enforcement authorities 'the real terrorists' was venting his anger on a different topic - the 'despicable' game of rugby league and its fans. In a Facebook post addressed to his followers, the Perth preacher recalled recent scenes of league fever in the heart of Bulldogs territory - Bankstown and Punchbowl in south-west Sydney. He said it was 'horrific'. Devout: Mohammed Junaid Thorne has not hesitated to make his opinions known in recent months. Passionate: Bulldogs fans turned out en masse to last night's grand final showdown. Bulldogs territory: The blue and white was out in force in south-west Sydney in recent weeks. 'Cars racing down the road driven by maniacs, horning and honking, disturbing Allah's creation, Muslim women (Hijabis unfortunately most of the time) hanging out of the windows screaming and yelling at the top of their lungs, and other despicable and despising scenes, all unfortunately done by Muslims, some of them in their Hijab or Islamic attire.' 'Spending a few days... especially around areas like Bankstown, Punchbowl and its surroudnings makes a Muslim bewildered and astonished to what his eyes see, but his heart struggles to accept and his brain to believe.' He lamented that the celebrations were not happening because of an occasion, like the religious festival, Eid al-Adha. Or because the United States had hypothetically ceased all airstrikes on the Islamic State. 'So why is all this happening?!' he continued. 'Sadly brothers and sisters, all this is because of a dirty game of rugby.' 'A game between two teams named after animals, that has caused grown men to lose their minds, grown women to lose their modesty, and some to lose their faith.' An enthusiastic Bulldogs fan wields a sign at the preliminary final against the Penrith Panthers earlier this month. He wrote that the scene was an example of 'Muslims in our time' and expressed his disgust with some Islamic women who drape themselves in the Bulldogs flag. He said they 'strip themselves from their clothes and modesty, to wrap themselves with a flag that has a dog on it, and dance side to side, rubbing shoulders and other parts of the body with tattooed men.' 'As one of our beloved Sheikhs said before: Football has become the Taghut of our time, the modern devil of this era,' he said. 'While the cries of our orphan children, our raped women, and the calls for help from our helpless elders all over the world failed to unite the Muslims, we see the flag that carries the picture of a dog uniting Sunnis, Shia, Christians, Atheists,and all other sorts of people.' Thorne has not shied from controversy in recent months. He has described Australian law enforcement authorities as the 'real terrorists', and has also said the shooting death of Numan Haider, 18, was 'cold-blooded murder'. Last month, he reported receiving death threats from 'Australians living in Australia'. Mr Thorne concluded his post, published yesterday, the day of the grand final, by saying he 'dreaded' what would happen at the game. But the streets of south-west Sydney were not filled with much celebration last night. Many Bulldogs fans were left disappointed when the Rabbitohs thumped the Canterbury side 30 - 6 in their first grand final victory in 43 years.","Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne pens furious tirade about rugby league and Canterbury Bulldogs fans .

"An enormous wall of dust has hit part of Australia as residents brace themselves for a tropical cyclone. The stunning images of the wild dust storm were captured by tugboat works and aeroplane passengers near the town of Onslow in north-western Australia. Local reports say the huge swathes of red sand and dust had been picked up by strong winds in the Indian Ocean before being dropped near the town. Scroll down for video . Menacing: The towering red dust storm is pictured rolling across the ocean as it approaches Onslow in West Australia . Tsunami of particles: Tugboat worker Brett Martin captured the terrifying wall of dust about 25 nautical miles from the coast . About to be engulfed: Ships are dwarfed by the huge cloud of dust which sailors said reduced visibility to just 100 metres . The tsunami-like wave of sand could be seen travelling for miles and dwarfed ships out at sea. Tugboat worker Brett Martin, who shot some of the pictures, said before the storm hit conditions were calm and glassy. But when the dust arrived visibility was reduced to just 100 metres and the swell rose to two metres. Looming on the horizon: Local weather forecasters said the dust had been picked up on land in the Indian Ocean . Terrifying: Families in the region were already preparing for the arrival of a category-three cyclone when the dust storm arrived . The dust storm engulfs the town of Onslow: It is the latest incident in weeks of dramatic weather in the country that has been besieged by terrible bush fires after unprecedented high temperatures . A dust or sand storm is a weather phenomenon common in arid regions like the Sahara. They develop when a strong wind blows loose sand and dirt from a dry surface, firstly causing them to 'creep' along the ground then saltate (or 'leap') into the air. When the particles then begin to break into smaller ones, they eventually become suspended in the wind. The term sandstorm is used most often in desert environments while dust storm is applied when finer particles are blown long distances, especially over urban areas. It is the latest incident in weeks of dramatic weather in the country that has been besieged by . terrible bush fires after unprecedented high . temperatures and strong winds ravaged much of the south east. Now, Australia's first cyclone of the storm season is intensifying off the country's northwest and is expected to start affecting coastal areas in mining powerhouse Western Australia state from today, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABM). ABM's manager of climate services Glenn Cook told The . Australian the dust storm was not directly related to the cyclone - the . centre of which is still hundreds of kilometres away. Wind gusts in Onslow reached 63mph and the dust storm was made worse by the lack of rain in the region. Climate . information officer John Relf told The Australian: 'If it's pretty dry . in land, boom, there you go. It was the right recipe.' He said dust storms were rare and may only happen once or twice a year, if at all. The dramatic weather is set to continue as the category-three cyclone heads to north-western Australia. Local forecasters warned of 60mph gales and gusts of more than 80mph and oil and mining operations are preparing to close when the cyclone lands. Car giant Chevron is also set to evacuate workers from Barrow Island - about 30 miles off the coast.

"Mystery: Russell Matthews reappeared in January after vanishing and being declared a missing person more than three months before . A man who served for more than 15 years in the Coast Guard has miraculously reappeared after being declared missing more than three months ago, Honolulu police and the Coast Guard said on Tuesday. Petty Officer First Class Russell Matthews, who worked as a rescue swimmer, returned to his home in Hawaii on Sunday night after he was presumed dead. Officials said he was incoherent and taken to a military hospital for observation. Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Gene . Maestas said the service doesn't know where Matthews, a Hawaii-based . rescue swimmer, has been and what he's been doing since his new wife . reported him missing on October 9. Matthews had been married once before and tragically lost his first wife, Clara, in 2011. The mother of his two children committed suicide in 2011 by shooting herself in the head; Matthews went missing around the one-year anniversary of her death, according to KITV. Authorities suspect that Matthews’ first wife pointed the gun at her head in part because of the traumatic brain injury she suffered two years prior in a bicycle accident. Scroll down for video . Without a trace: Matthews' car was left at the remote Kaena Point in Oahu three months ago . Happy family: Matthews pictured with his first wife, Clara, and their two young children . Tragedy: Clara and her children were involved in a head-on bicycling accident in 2009 and the mother suffered a traumatic brain injury; two years later, she committed suicide . According to reports at the time, Clara was hit by a car as she was riding her bicycle along the North Shore in Pupukea in March of 2009. Her two children, aged three and five, were riding along in a two-wheel trailer. Clara and her children were seriously injured when a woman veered her sedan into the bike lane and hit the family head-on. The mother was thrown from her bicycle and hit her head on the car’s windshield, while her children were pushed by the car around 80 feet, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Matthews was being investigated for marijuana use at the time of his disappearance. Coast . Guard investigators dispatched to see him confirmed his identity after . he called his command from Castle Medical Center in the Honolulu suburb . of Kailua, Maestas said. He's now being evaluated at Tripler Army . Medical Center in Honolulu. Coast . Guard investigators looking into his disappearance won't question him . until he's released by doctors, Maestas said. But the service will probe . the incident. Matthews' children have been staying with Clara's family members in his absence, KITV reports. The ABC affiliate adds that the rescue diver could face charges for going AWOL. Treatment: The petty officer is now being evaluated at Tripler Army Medical Center . 'We'll try to find out why he disappeared and all the details surrounding his case,' he said. Under investigation: Matthews, pictured before his disappearance, was under investigation for alleged marijuana use . Police . found the 36-year-old guardsman's car abandoned at Kaena Point, a . remote area of Oahu, when Matthews was reported missing in October. Crews from the Coast Guard, Navy, . state, county lifeguards and Honolulu fire and police departments . together searched more than 10,000 nautical square miles - on land and . at sea - for Matthews. The search was called off on December 13. Honolulu . Police Sgt. Kim Buffett of Crimestoppers said Matthews isn't giving the . police a statement because he's in the hospital. Detectives have no . reason to pursue the case as it's not against the law to be missing, she . said. The police case is closed now that Matthews has been found, she said. It's unusual for a Guardsman to go missing for months and then reappear, Maestas said. 'This is not the norm for the Coast Guard. In my 28 year career in the Coast Guard, I have never come across a case like this,' he said. Matthews, an aviation survival technician, has been in the Coast Guard for 15 years. He's been assigned to Hawaii since 2007. Last seen: Police found the 36-year-old guardsman's car abandoned at Kaena Point, a remote area of Oahu, when the man was reported missing in October .

"The cost to taxpayers of renovating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s London residence is set to double to around £2million. Bills for building work on Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace have spiralled and will eventually dwarf the £1.1million already spent, sources have revealed. Royal aides are braced for criticism over the use of public money to turn the 20-room, four-storey building into a new home for William, Kate and baby George. New arrivals: Kensington Palace is being made ready for William, Kate and baby Prince George to move in . Refrubishment: Kensington Palace, pictured last summer, is being renovated. Apartment 1A, a 20-room complex, is being made ready for new arrivals . Questions have already been raised . over the pair’s luxurious lifestyle after they returned last week from a . seven-day break in a five-star resort in the Maldives. Prince . Charles has denied that his organic garden at Highgrove is an . ‘expensive indulgence’ – insisting that it helps to heal ‘damaged . souls’. The money he . has lavished on the Gloucestershire estate is a reaction to the ‘carnage . of fashionable vandalism’ that has left once common shrubs, trees and . farm animals on the endangered list. Work . such as planting unusual British apple varieties is attempting to . repair ‘appallingly short-sighted’ damage to our soil, landscape and . souls, he writes in the foreword to a new book. And it comes shortly after the Queen cast protocol aside during an engagement to say that the world’s poor needed more help. Although . the Duke and Duchess are paying for fixtures and items such as curtains . and soft furnishings out of their own pockets, the cost of building . work including new heating, electrics and plastering is being met by . money given to the Queen by the Government. So . far the internal refurbishments have cost £600,000 and the renewal of . the apartment’s roof a further £400,000. Another £100,000 has been spent . on ‘professional fees’. But aides say work to renovate the apartment, which was once occupied by Princess Margaret, has far exceeded expectation. The . initial budget was, according to one source, ‘blown out of the water’ by the discovery of asbestos – and the final bill ‘is not likely to go . down well’ when the full details are revealed in June’s annual royal . finance report. Primary residence: The extensive apartment in Kensington Palace, first estimated to cost £1.1million, will be the young family's main residence . Grounds: Apartment 1A is actually a spacious four-storey, 20-room property with its own large south-facing walled garden . A . Kensington Palace spokesman said a close eye was being kept on costs but . said roofwork was long overdue and blamed the asbestos for sending the . bill skywards. Earlier this . month it emerged that Kate was having Apartment 1A redecorated at her . own expense because she was unhappy with the colour scheme she had . chosen while pregnant – apparently blaming her hormones. The spacious four-storey property takes up half the Clock Tower wing designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William. 'Paid privately': Some of the refurbishment costs are to come from the personal fortunes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Living . space once included five reception rooms, three main bedrooms, dressing . rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, nine staff bedrooms and . ‘ancillary’ rooms. Princess . Margaret herself spent £1.5million on refurbishment before moving in in . 1963. In recent years the property has been used and managed by . Historic Royal Palaces. As . the charity has already spent its own money on remedial work, the Queen . has compensated it for handing the building over to William and Kate. Developments: Work is also being done on Anmer Hall in Norfolk, where vivid orange roof tiles were installed over the winter . Bolthole: The 10-room Georgian home was given to William and Kate by the Queen . The . cost, met by taxpayers but described by palace sources as ‘fair’, it is . understood to be more than £100,000. A source said the apartment was . being ‘kept in trust for the nation’. ‘Looking after these buildings is the very thing the Royal Household is charged with doing,’ said the aide. But . Graham Smith, of anti-monarchy group Republic, said: ‘There is never a . good time to be throwing our money at people who can afford to pay it . themselves.’ Sources say . the Duchess is already busy on her next project – the decoration of . ten-bedroom Anmer Hall in Norfolk, given to them as a ‘country . residence’ by the Queen last year.","£1.1million has already been spent refurbishing 20-room Apartment 1A .

"The world's oldest underground railway carriage has been restored to its former glory - after being used as a garden shed. Carriage 353 was built in 1892 and took Victorian workers to their offices in the capital when the London Underground had first class compartments. It had gold leaf lettering, plush claret seating, and ornate gas lamps to illuminate the passengers' journeys. Many licks of paint! The Carriage that is now back in full working order was previously being used as a garden shed . The old London tube train carriage that has been restored by craftsman from the Festiniog and Welsh Highland Railway in North Wales . Looks comfy! The old leaf lettering, plush claret seating, and ornate gas lamps has been restored . But it was retired from the Circle Line in 1905 and later did 30 years service on a railway line in the West Country. When the line closed in 1940 it was turned into a shop, then a clubhouse for US soldiers in the war and finally a crumbling garden shed. But railway enthusiasts discovered the rotting carriage and realised it was the oldest known example. A team of craftsmen at The Festiniog and Welsh Highland Railway in North Wales took 15 months to strip away the decades of decay and patiently rebuild the magnificent carriage. Glory days: The carriage, pictured while it was in service, retired form the Circle line in 1905 . Carriage 353 was previously being used as a garden shed, a far cry from its original, glamorous use . Sorry state: Pictured is the carriage on its way into the workshop before the restoration, which has made it shine again . A National Lottery grant was awarded to restore the carriage to mark the 150th anniversary of the underground . Hard at work: The craftsmen managed to save 92 per cent of the carriage's teak frame . A National lottery grant of £422,000 was awarded to restore the carriage to mark the 150th anniversary of the underground. Andrew Thomas, of the Welsh Highland Railway, said: 'It was in a sorry state when it arrived. 'It had been used as a garden shed and had a toilet attached at the end. 'We had a team of six people including some apprentices because that was part of the deal with the Lottery Heritage Fund - they want us to teach young people new skills. 'It took an awful of of hard work but we were determined to restore it to its original pristine condition. It took 21 coats of varnish to make the carriage sparkle again - hardly a surprise given that the carriage was built in 1892 . A team of craftsmen at a small railway company in Wales took 15 months to strip away the rust and ruin . Back to its former glory: The carriage will tour around heritage railways in London and the South East for 10 years . The carriage was 'in a sorry state when it arrived' but has been spruced up after railway enthusiasts discovered it . Patiently restored: The carriage has more than £700 worth of 23.5 carat gold leaf on the carriage . 'To see the finished article was very special. To see her roll out for the first time was something else.' The craftsmen managed to save 92 per cent of the carriage's teak frame and after repairing it used 21 coats of varnish to make it sparkling again. All the signwriting was done by hand while modern LED lamps were fitted to give the appearance of the original gas mantles. The carriage says Metropolitan Line on it because when the Tube opened it was called the London's underground Metropolitan railway. There is more than half a mile of lining on the outside and more than £700 worth of 23.5 carat gold leaf on the carriage. The carriage will tour around heritage railways in London and the South East for 10 years before takings its place in the London Transport Museum. On 9 January this year, London Underground celebrated 150 years since the first underground journey took place between Paddington and Farringdon on the Metropolitan Railway. A range of events have been organised to commemorate the landmark date, with Prince Charles and his wife Camilla taking a ride on the Tube and a journey by a 19th Century steam train. 1863: London's underground Metropolitan or Met welcomes its first passengers. Within a month it would be welcoming 26,000 passengers a day. 1869:The East London Railway starts running steam trains through the Thames Tunnel. Built by Marc Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it was originally opened as a foot tunnel in 1843 for pedestrians to travel under the river between Rotherhithe and Wapping. It now forms part of the London Overground railway network. 1884: The Inner Circle line (now part of the Circle line) is completed through linking up the Metropolitan and District lines at both ends. Metropolitan 1, a restored steam train makes another journey, for the 150th anniversary of the London Underground . 1890: The world’s first deep level electric tube railway is opened between Stockwell and King William Street (now mostly part of the Northern line). Access to the station platforms was by hydraulic lift. The Underground first becomes known as the Tube. 1905: The District and Circle Lines become the first to become electrified . 1908: The Underground name and the iconic round symbol with a flat horizontal bar through it appear for the first time. 1911: The first escalators are turned on at Earl's Court station. 1929: Manual doors are used on the Underground for the last time with air operated doors used for the first time. 1933: The first Underground map in its recognisable modern form is produced by Harry Beck. 1940: The Underground played a key role in the Second World War, stations being used for the first time as shelters during the Blitz and a stretch of the Picadilly Line used to store treasures from the British Museum . 1952: The first aluminium trains are introduced. 1969: Queen Elizabeth II takes the controls of a train as she opens the Victoria Line . 1971: The last steam shuntings and freight locomotives use the Underground. 1975: 43 people are killed in a train crash on the Northern Line at Moorgate. 1987: A fire at Kings Cross station kills 31 people. 1994: Penalty fares are introduced on the Underground for the first time. 2003: Oyster cards are introduced for passengers and busking at Underground stations is legalised. 2005: 52 people are killed in bomb attacks on three Underground trains and a London bus on July 7. 2007: The Underground carries one billion passengers in a year for the very first time.","Carriage retired was used as a clubhouse for US soldiers in World War II .

"Wrinkles: Painted by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, the work portrays Elizabeth I in her sixties, with no attempt to hide the ravages of time . You may not have liked the Duchess of Cambridge’s first official portrait – but at least she got off more lightly than Elizabeth I. A painting of the Tudor  monarch has gone on display which, rarely, shows her with unflattering wrinkles. The work portrays Elizabeth in her sixties, resplendent in her regal glory, but with no attempt to hide the ravages of time. It was painted in the late sixteenth century by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger who was a renowned artist of the Tudor court. However, it is not clear why he was a little too true to life. In an early example of royal public relations, a proclamation had by then been issued to control how Elizabeth was seen by her public. It said ‘unseemly portraits which were to her great offence’ were to be defaced and only those approved by the Queen’s Sergeant Painter were to be produced. The painting – on show at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC – was described as unique by Thomas Herron, co-curator of the Folger Shakespeare Library exhibition Nobility and Newcomers in Renaissance Ireland. He said that while many artists of the time chose to make Elizabeth look young, visitors to the court said she had a grace and elegance in age that actually suited her. The Duchess of Cambridge’s portrait was unveiled last month, but the work by artist Paul Emsley was branded ‘ghastly’ and ‘lifeless’ by some critics.

"Poised, composed and entirely regal – this is Dame Helen Mirren as she steps into the Queen’s shoes for a second time. Her first outing as Her Majesty earned the actress an Oscar, and her next is already shaping up to be a huge success. Theatre-goers have spent £3.5million on tickets to watch her in The Audience, which opens at the Gielgud Theatre in London on Friday. Likeness: An exclusive picture of Dame Helen Mirren as Her Majesty in new play The Audience, left, and Queen Elizabeth II herself, right . The play examines the Queen’s relationship with her Prime Ministers during the weekly audiences held every Tuesday at Buckingham Palace throughout her reign. ’It’s more like therapy than state business at times,' said Robert Fox, one of the play’s three producers. ‘She’s like the psychiatrist in chief,' he added. ‘The play’s about someone who has been around for 60 years and has seen everything and in the end nothing really changes. It’s the same thing over and over again. 'There’s the similarities between Suez and Iraq .She’s seen it all and what’s kind of fascinating is that they (the Prime Ministers) come and make a lot of noise and bluster and they’re gone, then it’s somebody else. And she’s had twelve of them’. The Daily Mail’s exclusive photograph shows Mirren, 67, during the play’s ‘Thatcher years’ when the Queen would have been in her mid-sixties. Mirren was 59 when she made the movie The Queen eight years ago, though she was playing a monarch  - at the time of Princess Diana’s death --  who was 71. Reprise: Helen Mirren previously played the monarch in the 2006 film The Queen . In the play the actress will portray the Queen from the time she took the throne in 1952 to the present day. She will be transformed from eager young Queen to the present day ‘grandmother of the nation’, to use a phrase from The Audience’s  director Stephen Daldry. The Queen’s look through various ages  will be achieved using skilled make-up and hair designer Ivana Primorac, costumes by Bob Crowley and subtle lighting by Rick Fisher. ‘Her voice has changed’, Mirren told the Daily Mail. ‘She had a terribly posh voice when she was young  and it has changed over the years so I can use that. But there’s unbelievable consistency in everything from dress to hairstyle to professional attitude,' the actress explained. 'But there’s been a lot of changes in her Prime Ministers. She has seen them come and go,' Mirren said. ‘In the beginning with Winston Churchill the Queen is the young, nervous ,unknowledgeable one. 'But as she progresses through them, they become the nervous ones. She’s the one constant, through a revolving door of Prime Ministers,' Mirren said. For the ‘Thatcher years’ scenes, Margaret Thatcher will be played by Haydn Gwynne. Peter Morgan, who wrote both The Queen and The Audience, explained that just one particular audience is observed with Lady Thatcher half-way through her time in Number Ten. Queen once more: The actress is seen with Queen Elizabeth, who she will now play on stage in London's West End, at a reception in 2011 . ‘It sort of gives an opportunity for them to explore their relationship both as leaders and as mothers,' said Morgan. But also, he added, ‘as women who are separated by just six months. They are women of exactly the same generation'. Morgan refused to be drawn on . exactly what occurs during the audience between the Queen and the . country’s first woman Prime Minister. There . has always been talk of tensions between them when they met but Morgan . suggested we ‘might be surprised ‘ about what went on between them. However, not all the PMs will be given star billing at the Gielgud Theatre. For starters, Blair does not have an audience with the Queen and nor do Macmillan, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, or Heath. Callaghan got in by the skin of his teeth, the actor David Peart was cast to play him very recently. Those . close to the play believe people are fed up with Blair and also that . Morgan wrote films that heavily feature Blair, The Deal and The Queen. Morgan explained that Blair has a ‘presence in the play but not an audience’. In any event Morgan does not think history will remember Blair with ‘any great affection’. Rather he’ll be remembered, Morgan noted, 'as a born vote winner in a telegenic age’. Acclaim: The actress won an Oscar for her performance as Queen Elizabeth in the 2006 film written by Peter Morgan . Reign: The new play at London's Gielgud Theatre examines the Queen's relationship with the country's prime ministers over her years on the throne . Morgan also suggested that Blair has somewhat squandered his post Downing Street years. ‘Not a great deal of public service more self-service’, he opined. But Morgan believes the Queen’s not  'a political creature and I don’t think she has party preferences’. He added: 'There are Conservatives for whom she had great affection such as John Major, Winston Churchill, and Alec Douglas-Home, and there are Labour Prime Ministers for whom she had great affection; Jim Callaghan and Harold Wilson. ‘She was very fond of Major. I don’t think she had much time for Heath, even Macmillan. I don’t think she particularly looked forward to her audiences with either of those gentlemen.’","Helen Mirren will again assume the role of the Queen - this time on stage .

"England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster says, by his own performance-clock measurement, that the team have made just 15 minutes’ progress over the last year, despite Saturday’s victory over Australia. Lancaster uses the clock to gauge where his team are — from the six o’clock nadir of England’s woeful performance on and off the field in New Zealand in 2011, when the two hands were as far apart as they can be, to the perfect alignment of noon, where he wants to be for the 2015 World Cup on home soil. Lancaster judged England to be at 10pm after the autumn series in 2013 and disappointingly his watch has only moved on to 10.15pm, so the clock is ticking if they are to improve enough before the big kick-off at Twickenham on September 18. England head coach Stuart Lancaster (right) uses a performance-clock measurement to assess progress . However, Lancaster is lucky in having the full support of the RFU, who would still have backed him if England had lost to Australia. Chief executive Ian Ritchie said before the match he had every confidence in Lancaster and his staff justifying their extended six-year contracts — awarded in October — even if they suffered another blow in the autumn series. Understandably, Lancaster said he would have preferred a different order of games during November, rather than starting with the All Blacks followed by South Africa. But despite his long RFU deal, Lancaster will have no say in the autumn fixtures arranged up to 2019.

Cummings’s wife Joyce has been elected acting secretary to keep the league afloat in John’s absence. RFU chairman Bill Beaumont’s idea of being controversial is calling it a ‘challenging’ task for England Rugby 2015 to meet their extortionate £80million World Cup guarantee to the International Rugby Board. Yet Bill surprisingly agreed to meet famous streaker Erica Roe at Twickenham. Erica made her topless run at half-time during the 1982 England v Australia match while captain Beaumont was giving his half-time talk on the pitch. It prompted scrum-half Steve Smith to quip: ‘Hey Bill, some bird’s just run on with your bum on her chest.’ Erica, who had her photograph taken with Beaumont by the West Gate 32 years after their first Twickenham encounter, was promoting a breast-cancer awareness calendar.

And all those who know rugby league great Burgess say that he is such a strong character and presence he would give a lift to England’s Six Nations squad even while learning the 15-man code. The RFU’s obsession with milking Twickenham matches for all they are worth now extends to sending sales reps around all the hospitality boxes to sell merchandise to those who haven’t been to the superstore.","England coach uses his own performance-clock measurement .

"Four elite ‘anti-gang’ police officers were under arrest in Paris today after a woman tourist accused them of banding together to rape her. The alleged attack is said to have taken place at 36 Quai des Orfevres – the famous headquarters of the city’s judicial police next door to the city’s law courts. A Canadian woman aged 34 said she met the men in an Irish pub just across the Seine River from the building late on Tuesday night. The alleged attack is said to have taken place at 36 Quai des Orfevres in Paris, pictured - the famous headquarters of the city's judicial police next door to the city's law courts . From Toronto, she got into conversation with the off-duty men because she said she worked for Canadian police in her home city for three years. ‘The evening was a drunken one, and members of the BRI were said to be involved in the attack,’ said a source close to the case. The BRI is the so-called ‘Research and Intervention Brigade’- an ‘anti-gang’ squad set up by the French Interior ministry to combat organised crime. The woman is said to have been persuaded to visit the men’s offices in the Quai des Orfevres – an address which is as well known in France as New Scotland Yard is in Britain. There she was allegedly subjected to a brutal sex act, with all the officers involved, but they have denied any wrong doing. ‘If the facts are true, it is clearly rape, not sexual assault,’ a source told Le Parisien newspaper, adding that ‘It was at the request of the tourist that she went to visit their workplace. However, they deny having any sexual relationship with the woman.’ The alleged victim, a Canadian woman aged 34, said she met the police officers in an Irish pub just across the Seine River from the police headquarters late on Tuesday night . She arrived in France on April 18 and was due to spend two weeks visiting Paris. The source said ‘she was in a state of hysteria’ when she reported the rape on Wednesday morning. The officers arrested are a captain, a lieutenant, a brigadier and major, and all are currently in custody pending possible criminal charges. An investigation is being coordinated by the IGPN – a police designed to deal with crimes committed by police officers. None of the parties to the case can yet be named for legal reasons. Anne-Laure Compoint, one of the lawyers for the four officers, confirmed the arrests, but said she objected to ‘any violation of the secrecy of the investigation’. Bernard Boucault, the Prefect of the Paris police, was liaising with prosecutors over the claims, reported AFP, France’s national news agency. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Four 'anti-gang' police officers arrested after tourist claims she was raped .

DESIGNATED PLAYERS . Nicknamed the Beckham rule after David Beckham signed for LA Galaxy in 2007, the complex regulations were brought in to ensure clubs didn’t overload their teams with highly paid foreign stars. So , instead, it limits mega money signing to two per franchise. That means they can paid wages which exceed the strict salary cap – currently around $2.9 million - imposed in MLS. It basically allows teams to spend big yet enables parity with everyone else. For example, there will never be a situation where a team like Chelsea spends millions more than the rest of the League. There is an option to have a third slot but teams must pay a $250,000 'luxury tax'. That sum would be distributed equally to all MLS teams who have stuck with the originally allotted two.

"For those who happen to support Chesterfield, Ernie Moss needs no introduction. For those who don't, Moss was a giant of a centre-forward through the '70s and '80s, a prolific goalscorer and leader of the line with majestic aerial prowess. He represented nine different clubs, making 749 Football League appearances, and many more as he played on in non-league, but it was at Chesterfield, his hometown club where he is a legend, and the record scorer with 191 goals in three spells at the club. When the North Derbyshire club enjoyed their most glorious moments, he was usually around: for promotion in 1970 and 1985 and the Anglo-Scottish Cup win in 1981, when Chesterfield overcame Glasgow Rangers on the way to winning a rare if obscure trophy. Ernie Moss, pictured while coaching Kettering Town, is suffering from Pick's Disease . Moss gets above Sheffield United's John McAlle during a clash at Vale Park in 1981 . Moss made 749 Football League appearances during his time as a player . Pick's disease is a form of dementia. It is caused when certain nerve cells in the brain die and the pathway connectors change. It can lead to a change of personality and behaviour. Off the field he was gentle, articulate, friendly and genuinely popular; a hometown hero who opened a sports shop in the town when his professional playing career finally ended and he and went on to manage several clubs in non-League. These days, at the age of 65, Moss still looks in the good shape - former Chesterfield goalkeeper Jim Brown insists he is 'the most naturally-fit player' he has ever encountered - and he still exercises regularly but his mind is not the same. Moss suffers from Pick's Disease, a type of frontotemporal dementia caused by the destruction of nerve cells in the brain, which affects his memory and communication. The first symptoms were noticed more than 10 years ago and he was diagnosed eight years ago, although his family did not make his illness public until last year. There is no cure and he has already survived the normal life expectancy. Proof is difficult, but his family, friends and former team-mates are convinced this early onset of dementia is related to heading the ball as often as he did throughout a 20-year career of 749 games. Moss, pictured playing for Chesterfield, was a prolific striker for the Spireites . There are parallels to former West Bromwich Albion and England centre-forward Jeff Astle and other footballers from the same era who were powerful in the air and have suffered degenerative brain diseases. Moss was certainly renowned for his heading ability, not only at Chesterfield but with all the teams he played for in the Football League: Peterborough, Mansfield, Port Vale, Lincoln, Doncaster, Stockport, Scarborough and Rochdale. 'Most will agree Ernie was not the best ball-player or dribbler but he was by far one of the best centre forwards around at that time,' said Brown, who became Chesterfield's commercial manager when his career ended and has been in the role for more than 30 years. 'He was a towering target-man, always dangerous in the air to the opposition at corners and free-kicks, very difficult to mark in the box, could always read the game well and had the knack of being in the right place at the right time, particularly in the penalty area which made him a good natural goalscorer.' On Saturday, Chesterfield will host 'Ernie Moss Day' in his honour when they play Port Vale, in League One to raise awareness of the condition and funds for research charities. Robbie Earle has lavished praise on Moss by calling the striker a 'great goalscorer' Moss was voted Vale's Player of the Year in 1982 and Robbie Earle recalled how he helped shape his career as he emerged as a young player at Vale Park. 'He was a great goalscorer but when I played with him in the early '80s, he knew how to create chances for others,' said Earle. Chesterfield will have items on sale at the Proact Stadium including limited-edition badges, a special edition of the match-day programme dedicated to his career and an ale brewed by the local Brampton Brewery called 'Ernie 8'. Some of his former team-mates will be in attendance, along with Moss and his family, wife Jenny and daughters Sarah and Nikki.","Ernie Moss played for Chesterfield during the 1970s and 1980s .

"A rural North Carolina community that was horrified last year when an 11-year-old girl was raped and murdered in her own bed has been shocked again - this time after a neighbor boy, aged just 14, was arrested and charged with the crime. McKenzie Mae Sessoms, a fifth grader from Clinton, North Carolina, was found suffocated with a pillow last September 6 - the morning after her adult brothers threw a 'rowdy gathering' at the family home. On Wednesday, police announced the arrest of a young teenage boy, who is charged with first-degree rape and murder. Officials did not release his name, but family and neighbors identified him as Antonio Trey Jones. He turned 15 on Thursday. Murdered: McKenzie Sessoms, 11, was found raped and suffocated in her bed last September . The North Carolina fifth grader loved to ride horses and just wanted to do 'little girl things,' her grandmother said . At the time of the murder, Jones was living with his grandfather Howard Jones in a house off a dirt road - just feet from McKenzie's home, Mr Jones told WTVD-TV. 'If he done it, I'm glad they got him. That's all I can say,' Mr Jones said. Family members identified Antonio Trey Jones, 14, as the suspect in the crime . An autopsy report says that McKenzie was found wedged against the pillow that was used to suffocate her. Her pants were rolled down and a quilt was covering her body. According to WBTW, her father found her when he went to wake her for school the next day. It is believed she lived in the home alone with her father and brothers. Authorities said they arrested the suspect after using DNA evidence to match him to the crime. Mr Jones said his grandson Antonio had moved away to live with his mother. McKenzie's family said Antonio was banned from the girl's home after he made 'vulgar' comments to her, WTVD reports. However, a Jones family friend told the TV station that the boy is mentally disabled, suffers epilepsy and is incapable of such violence. He is also in special education. 'He's just as sweet as he can be,' Rhonda Wright said. 'Trey is being accused of terrible, terrible things that I just don't see him mentally capable of doing at all.' 'He told his mother yesterday they confused him,' she added. 'He was very confused. He said they turned some things around that he said.' McKenzie's family says she was focused on being a little girl. 'She loved riding horses, riding four-wheelers, just hanging with her friends,' grandmother Cathy Starke told the TV station. 'She had her whole life planned. I don't know what made him do it, but I hope that by him doing it, he realizes that he's really messed up his life as well as taking McKenzie away from us.' 'Thank God they've done their job, and they've done it well,' she said of the police investigation. 'Now just keep us in your prayers.'","McKenzie Mae Sessoms was found raped and murdered at her home in North Carolina on September 6 .

After arriving in Beijing on Thursday, Mrs Obama will spend Friday with Peng Liyuan, the wife of President Xi Jinping, who will take the three generations of Obama to visit a school in the capital. She is scheduled to address American and Chinese students at Peking University on Saturday about the importance of study abroad and other cultural exchanges as well as the stakes the two countries have in one another's success.

"His face masked with a  balaclava, war games fanatic Wayne Smith is captured on CCTV as he boards a train en route to murder his love rival. The IT technician stabbed Jon Britton to death on his front doorstep with a pound-shop carving knife after discovering he was having an affair with his estranged wife. Smith, 38, made the discovery when he hacked into Sarah Arbon’s Facebook account, then started secretly filming her with webcams. He tried to cover his tracks by convincing his friend Steven Hatton to give a false alibi that they had been playing the tabletop war game Necromunda on the evening of the murder. Scroll down for video . Wayne Smith was seen on train CCTV travelling to victim Jon Britton's house after putting on a hooded disguise . Smith, who was jailed for life for Mr Britton's murder this week, later discarded the clothes he used in the attack, but they were recovered by police and used as evidence . But this week Smith was  convicted of murder and jailed for life, with a minimum term of 28 years. Liverpool Crown Court heard he had an ‘obsessive hatred’ of Mr Britton, 43, and blamed him for the breakdown of his marriage to Miss Arbon, 36. They wed in 2010 and had a daughter together. But the relationship deteriorated when he went on long-term sick leave and expected Miss Arbon, an administrator, to look after him while he spent the day playing computer games. She started a relationship with Mr Britton, a landscape gardener, after realising she was ‘with the wrong man’. Smith confronted Mr Britton after finding out about the affair, saying, ‘I could kill you’, and posted messages about the relationship on Facebook. Miss Arbon eventually moved out. She said: ‘I was scared of Wayne. I didn’t love him any more. I loved Jon.’ Jealous IT worker Smith, pictured (left) after his arrest and (right) at a war games event, will serve at least 28 years behind bars for the murder in West Kirby, Merseyside . Smith was filmed on his own CCTV cameras . leaving his home on December 3 last year, before he made his way to . Hatton’s house, where he changed into a black hood. He then took a train to West Kirby, . Merseyside, where Mr Britton had bought a house to live in with Miss . Arbon. Two friends who were visiting Mr Britton heard him answer the . doorbell then cry out. They found him lying in the hallway while Smith stabbed him up to five times. Steven Hatton has also been jailed for providing Smith with a false alibi . He used such force the handle snapped off the knife. Mr Britton was taken to hospital with stab wounds to the neck and chest, but died later that night. An off-duty policeman walking his dog later found the discarded black clothing and gloves used by Smith, containing his DNA. Smith denied murder but judge Mrs Justice Susan Carr said  his behaviour was ‘coldblooded and premeditated’. She said: ‘The motive for this dreadful crime was your obsessive hatred for Mr Britton, whom you saw as having stolen your wife, Sarah Arbon, from you ...Your behaviour in the aftermath of your relationship with Miss Arbon went well beyond normal jealousy.’ She added Smith had used his ‘considerable computer, technical and strategy skills to spy’ on his wife and that he had told the jury ‘a sophisticated, arrogant pack of lies’. ‘Whatever personal and emotional turmoil you were in as a result of the breakdown of your relationship … nothing that the court has been told about you and your circumstances could possibly justify your actions that day,’ she added. Hatton, 23, admitted assisting an offender and attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for six months. Necromunda is a table-top war game that was launched in 1995 and followed on from the Warhammer series. It is made for two to four players, who use 28mm figures to take over different parts of an imaginary post-apolocalyptic terrain. The game is set in a fantasy land in which creatures have built huge termite mound-type cities to escape the polluted air and reach the upper atmosphere. The game involves trying to take control of these 'cities' and control the industry of various tribes. The games characters are divided into six main groups, Orlocks, Cawdors, Delaques, Eschers, Goliaths and Van Saars, although players can purchase others. The game has become popular with players because of its 3D playing table and intricate building structures.","Wayne Smith spied on ex Sarah Arbon after she left him for Jon Britton .

"A British teenager on a gap year has been found dead in Colombia after taking a hallucinogenic drug in a tribal ritual. Henry Miller, 19, who was due to go to university in September, had travelled to a remote rainforest area in the long-troubled South American country and taken 'Yage', which induces vivid hallucinations and supposedly spiritual experiences. The youngster took the drug twice with a local tribe, and collapsed on the second occasion. Found dead: Henry Miller, 19, has travelled into remote Colombian rainforest (file image) Hours later Henry's body was dumped on a lonely dirt road. His corpse was later found there on Wednesday, and photographed for a grim image on a local news website. Colombian police are now investigating the death, and the people who supplied Henry with Yage, which was said by one local to kill a couple of people there every year. Henry, from Bristol, had been travelling round South America for some months, but only recently arrived in the remote town of Mocoa in the Putumayo region. Around a week ago he booked in to the Casa del Rio hostel there. The hostel continues to list the taking of the potentially lethal hallucinogen on its 'things to do' web page, saying: 'experience Yagé, Indian tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate'. Drink: Yage is made from a plant known as 'the vine of the dead' (pictured) The young Briton, who appears to have been travelling alone but had made friends on his travels, first drank the drug on Sunday without suffering apparent harm, then took it again on Tuesday. Henry travelled a short distance from his hostel to take the drug on the land of a shaman named as Guillemo Mavisoy Mutumbajoy from the Kamentsa tribe, among a small group of other tourists from around the world. There was one local report that Henry fell unconscious at around 3am on Wednesday morning, and that attempts were made to revive him with a nettle ointment said to be an antidote to Yage. One source was reported as telling a local Colombian news site: 'A couple of people die every year from taking Yage. I can't say very much as there is a police investigation. 'Henry was a very decent polite young man who looked more like a student than a hippy. He was not the sort of person you would expect that would take Yage.' The source added that Miller, who was travelling alone but had met others on his south American journey, may have been talked into taking the potentially lethal herbal cocktail. He revealed that Miller took part in the drug taking ritual twice while he was in Mocoa, with just one day between sessions, and 'was planning to travel on but changed his mind to go and take it again'. Investigators from the Colombian Attorney General's Office removed the body to Mocoa to establish the cause of death. A UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national on 23 April in Colombia. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'","Henry Miller, 19, was found dumped on dirt road after visiting remote tribe .

"A celebrity antiques dealer has bought a piece of graffiti inspired by the London riots which he believes is worth £50,000. The mural, which he paid a four figure sum for, was sprayed on the garage door of a vegan community centre in Hackney in the aftermath of the disturbances in 2011.

It’s now time for the door to give someone else a chance . to view it as a window into a different world. 'As a result of the sale to Lamberty, .

Two years ago Stik was a homeless . street artist only just beginning to leave his strange, distinctive . stick figures across London’s skyline. Now he has become one of the British art world’s hottest properties. Galleries clamour to stage Stik . exhibitions and his paintings hang in the homes of stars including Elton . John, Bono, Brian May and Tinie Tempah. His meteoric rise has led to comparisons with Banksy - the satirical artist whose tags have drawn widespread critical acclaim.

"An unarmed woman violently shoved over a bench by a police officer during student riots in Arizona claims she was subjected to excessive force. Christina Gardilcic was seen on video footage being thrown over a metal frame by an officer in full riot gear during a demonstration from the University of Arizona on Saturday. Speaking for the first time, Gardilcic said the incident took place so fast she had no idea what was happening. Scroll down for video . 'My feet were up in the air... it was excessive force': Christina Gardilcic has spoken out for the time since she was violently shoved over a bench by a police officer during student riots in Arizona . Received threats: A picture reportedly showing Sgt Joel Mann, the riot officer who threw Gardilcic to the floor. He has been reassigned for safety reasons after a furious backlash from the public . She told ABC News: 'We were just walking on a sidewalk and the next thing I know I was just on a bench, my feet were up in the air. 'What happened to me, I consider excessive force. I had no idea I was doing anything wrong. If I was, and he physically shoved me and I fell, I could have been really hurt.' The officer has been identified as Sgt Joel Mann, according to KGUN9. His colleague Sgt Pete Dugan told the station that Sgt Mann has been re-assigned by the force for safety reasons as a precaution after receiving several threats. Tucson Police are investigating the threats made toward Mann and will seek prosecution as appropriate, he added. Video footage of the incident was captured during a riot by students from the . University of Arizona after they lost to Wisconsin in Anaheim, . California, during the NCAA basketball tournament on Saturday. Fans back home at the college's Tucson campus had taken to the streets in a disorderly display of disappointment.

The woman's legs can be seen dangling over the bench after she was hit by police (left) and (right) members of the public react angrily to the force used against the young woman . The officer in riot gear appears from nowhere throwing the girl over the metal frame. After tackling the girl to the ground the officer walks away but fails to arrest or restrain her for any offence. The clip has appeared on YouTube and been watched nearly 50,000 times. However, the online community has reacted angrily to the force used by the officer. One commentator wrote: 'If you slow the YouTube down frame by frame you will see she does nothing. The blonde consoling her says they were trying to find a way around the crowd to get to their cars.' Another added: 'She was just standing there, not attacking anyone. The little cop decided to pick on someone smaller than himself to show how big and bad he was, when in reality he looked like some Power Ranger figure.' However, one person said: 'Perhaps... Just perhaps, she should not have walked TOWARDS the riot police. 'Honestly, if you're an officer and see someone coming up behind you and your fellow officers while a riot is taking place, you would be concerned too. 'Now, the officers force may have been much, but what if the girl had not been innocent? He would then be deemed a hero. Don't be too quick to judge.' Meanwhile, another clip filmed on someone's phone during the riot shows a student standing up to police and taking pepper balls to the chest and abdomen when they tried to tackle him to the ground.

"Killed: Police say Janaki Rose Hayes didn't hear the train that ran her down while she was jogging because her headphones were playing music too loudly . A California woman was struck and killed Wednesday by a freight train while wearing headphones as she jogged along busy tracks near a popular hiking trail. Janaki Rose Hayes, 27, of Truckee, was wearing headphones that fully covered her ears and did not hear the blaring horn as the steel beast bared down on her around 1.45 p.m., police said. Investigators believe she was jogging towards a trail for the bulk of her workout and that the death was an accident, sources told the Sacramento Bee. Hayes, who had recently moved from Oregon to the small town just north of Lake Tahoe, was just short of the pedestrian bridge when the Union Pacific train caught up to her, cops said. ‘We concluded from our investigation that her intent was to cross the river at some point to access the Legacy Trail for a jog,’ Police Chief Adam McGill in a news release. She was headed westbound on the rails. The operators slowed the train but could not stop in time to avoid hitting her. ‘It appears the train operators did not contribute to this accident and did all they could to avoid it,’ said McGill. Shielded: The black tarp to the left of the locomotive kept Hayes' body from view . Where it happened: The site of the train accident that killed Hayes . The train was eventually brought to a halt and the engineers remained on the scene to aid authorities in the investigation, cops said. First responders found the woman’s body at the scene. Footage showed them shielding her body from view of news media with a black tarp just to the left of the locomotive. The freight train was headed from Sparks, Nevada, to Roseville, California. It is not clear how many cars were being towed or what the cargo was. The only passengers on board the train were the operators. Police do not believe alcohol or drugs contributed to the incident.","Janaki Rose Hayes died Wednesday afternoon after being hit by a Union Pacific train headed for Roseville, California .

"A father-of-three who was wrongfully imprisoned for 23 years after being framed for murder by a rogue detective has reached a $6.4 million settlement with New York City. David Ranta, 59, was freed last year after being jailed for the 1990 shooting of a Brooklyn rabbi. On his release, he filed a $150 million claim that was settled before it even reached the city's legal department - a decision that apparently acknowledges the overwhelming evidence the city faced. 'While no amount of money could ever . compensate David for the 23 years that were taken away from him, this . settlement allows him the stability to continue to put his life back . together,' Ranta’s lawyer, Pierre Sussman, said, the New York Times reported. Payout: David Ranta, pictured after he walked free from prison last March, has won a $6.4 million payout from the City of New York after he served 23 years for a murder he did not commit . Heading home: Ahead of his release, a year-long investigation found that witnesses had lied in the case . 'We are now focusing . our efforts on pursuing an unjust conviction claim with the state of New . York.' Ranta, who had a heart . attack one day after his release, 'would like everyone to . know he is happy to have a chance at recovering his health, taking care . of his heart and being there for his family and children', Sussman said. Ranta has three children, including a daughter who was just a baby when he was locked away. The . case is the first expected to be brought against the city by former . inmates who were convicted based on allegedly botched investigative work . by Louis Scarcella. The . detective, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of making up . confessions, leading witnesses and using informers who have since . admitted lying for better sentencing deals. Murdered: Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger, (center right), attends a wedding in the Williamsburg section of the Brooklyn borough of New York. He was shot in the head during a botched robbery in 1990 . Ranta was convicted of killing Hasidic rabbi and Holocaust survivor Chaskel Werzberger as he got inside his car just as a jewelry store was being robbed nearby. Werzberger was shot in the head and the robber used his car as a getaway vehicle. Ranta, who had previously had small . run-ins with the law, was sentenced to 37 years to life in prison even . though there was no physical evidence linking him to the scene. Then-district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, fought off numerous appeals in the case, even when evidence pointed to another killer, Joseph Astin, who later died in a car crash. Years after the conviction, a witness who was just 13 when he was brought before a line up said he was told to pick the man with 'the big noise'. His revelation sparked an investigation by the district attorney’s Conviction Integrity Unit that ultimately led to Ranta's release. Convicted: A witness, who was just 13 at the time, said that a detective told him to pick out the man 'with the big nose' from the line-up - and only Ranta (number 3) fitted that description . It uncovered two other witnesses also said they had lied after Scarcella offered them the chance to get out of jail if they provided information, the Times reported. Questions: Retired detective Louis Scarcella was once celebrated for cracking murder cases . Ranta had also accused Scarcella, who has now retired, of making up his confession, which the detective claimed took place while the suspect was handcuffed at Central Booking. It later emerged that Scarcella had gleaned six confessions from different inmates with the same words - 'You got it right. I was there' - and that he had used the same witness in different cases. Prosecutors also learned that Scarcella had received an anonymous call saying Joseph Astin was responsible for the killing and questioned his wife - but dropped the lead when Astin died. His wife even testified in 1996 that he had admitted the murder to her on the day but he died two months later. Efforts by Ranta's legal team to free him on the testimony failed. Scarcella allegedly never submitted any paperwork showing that he had investigated Astin. Authorities said around 50 of his cases would be reopened. He has since retired. Of the settlement, Comptroller Scott M. Stringer said: 'This settlement is in the best interests of all parties and closes the door on a truly regrettable episode in our city’s history. I am pleased that my office was able to move quickly on this case.' Ranta, who had filed the claim against the city two months after his release, is also expected to make a wrongful conviction claim against the state.","David Ranta, 59, was freed in March 2013 after he served 23 years for the shooting death of a Brooklyn rabbi in 1990 .

"A BBC documentary filmmaker is feared to have drowned off Barbados. Jay Merriman Mukoro was on a holiday with his wife, who he married less than a year ago, and waded into the sea for a swim on Rockley Beach in Christ Church. The 43-year-old television producer, who recently worked as researcher on Andrew Marr’s ‘History of Modern Britain’, disappeared at 2pm and his wife Olivia told the Barbados Today newspaper that there was only a 15-minute period between seeing him enter the water and realising he hadn’t returned. Missing: Jay Merriman Mukoro pictured with his wife Olivia on their wedding day. She is said to be distraught . A body was located at 6.30am local time near the Hilton Hotel on the same beach, and police are carrying out tests to establish if it is that of Mr Merriman. According to Nation News, Olivia was present at the scene along with police officers and a family support officer. Speaking about the last moments she saw her husband, Olivia said: ‘I was looking at him initially as he walked into the water and I had a book which I looked down at for a while. ‘Then when I looked up I couldn’t see him any more. I thought he must have just been out of my sight and then I saw someone who I thought was him and so I read my book a little bit more. ‘Then I looked up and I saw the person and realized they had a different build and it wasn’t him. ‘It was at that point I started getting worried and I got up and started looking up and down. Then I started to panic because I was looking and wasn’t seeing him on the beach.’ In the hours that followed, Mrs Merriman Mukoro alerted the authorities and fruitlessly searched for him into the night. At the time there was a yellow flag flying on the beach which indicated caution should be taken. Mrs Merriman Mukoro said the waves were high but there were a lot of people on the beach that day, and that Jay was usually very careful and would not go swimming too far out. Worry: Mrs Merriman Mukoro said the waves were high but there were a lot of people on the beach that day, and that Jay was usually very careful and would not go swimming too far out . The psychologist, who has been in . constant contact with the lifeguard, police officers and other . authorities, said: ‘They have been looking since then and did not find . anything. So they tell me they are still looking.’ She . added that she was told that usually a body would be carried to a . certain point if drowned, so it was strange that her husband’s body had . not been found. This was the couple’s first time to . Barbados, and they had flown out to attend a wedding and for Mr Merriman . Mukoro, a journalist with the BBC for the past ten years, to work on a . documentary for BBC Scotland. He has previously worked on Mixed Britannia and the BAFTA award-winning series History of Modern Britain. Mrs . Merriman Mukoro said the couple had just began to ‘imagine our life . together, our future, our children together’ and added: ‘There is not . much hope, but there is a tiny glimmer that some miraculous thing has . happened that we can’t conceive of and that somehow he is somewhere and . that is why we are making posters to put those around. ‘I am feeling incredibly lost, in shock and in pain. There is always that possibility of a miracle. It is a desperate time.’ Vanished: The documentary film maker swam out to sea off Rockley Beach, pictured . She . also said that if her husband had drowned, she would like to find the . body so she could bring it back to Britain for a memorial service ‘so . that people who love him and respect him can be there and celebrate his . life and grieve together’. One . of Jay’s close friends and colleagues, commissioning editor at the BBC, . Tony Phillips, told Barbados Today that his professional bond with Jay . grew quickly over the years. He . said: ‘He charms all who come into contact with him, with his . inquisitive nature and thoughtfulness to others. If only more of us . journalists or otherwise, could be like him. Jay is always kind and . never less than polite.’ BBC . Scotland Editor, Marcus Ryder, said: ‘Jay had been in Glasgow for just a . few weeks and had already become a very popular and respected friend . and colleague. ‘We’ve been . liaising closely with Olivia and the authorities in Barbados since she . told us what happened and we’ve been offering any support we can at what . is a very difficult time for her.’ Anybody who believes they have seen Jay, or anybody matching his description looking disorientated and confused, is being asked to contact Worthing Police Station, Barbados.","BBC journalist Jay Merriman Mukoro went missing on Sunday in Barbados .

"Sophie Howes, left, was trying to breast feed her daughter Connie, right) at a Leisure Centre in Kent when the centre manager said it was 'offensive' A mother ordered to stop breast feeding in a swimming pool because staff found it 'offensive' has received a payout from the leisure centre. Sophie Howes, 27, decided to feed her hungry eight-month-old daughter Connie when she started to get restless. The mother-of-two sat down on the steps of the learner pool and began to breast feed the toddler in a bid to calm her down. Within seconds the centre manager Kim Walters came up to her and ordered her to move after the lifeguard reported that she had been 'offended' Miss Howes reluctantly said she would go to the side of the pool but was ordered to go to the changing room if she wished to continue feeding Connie. The midwife, from Ashford, Kent, said staff made her feel 'embarrassed' and 'humiliated'. She claimed the centre had breached the Equality Act 2010, which provides protection for women wanting to breastfeed their children. And now Miss Howes has received an undisclosed pay out from the Ashford Leisure Trust, who run the Stour Centre, after they agreed an out of court settlement. The centre's management said there had been 'no intention to discriminate' against Miss Howes and said the incident was result of a 'misunderstanding.' They said they 'apologised' for any distress caused. She said: 'I decided to take a stance as I believe no woman should be made to feel embarrassed by wanting to breastfeed their child in public. 'Women have rights to be protected from less favourable treatment and to equal access to facilities just because they want to breastfeed their children. 'It's important that when this kind of thing happens we challenge the practices and policies of services providers to ensure it doesn't happen again to others.' Lucy Angus, from Unity Law, represented Ms Howes and said many women aren't aware of their rights. She said: 'This case is important as it gives breastfeeding mums the confidence to know they can challenge discriminatory treatment of this kind. 'Many breastfeeding mums aren't aware of their rights in the same way service providers, such as leisure centres, aren't aware of their legal obligations. This case helps to raise awareness of the issue from both perspectives.' MIss Howes, left won an undisclosed payout from the leisure centre when she was stopped from breastfeeding her daughter Connie, centre. Ms Howes said her mother Virginia, right, was a great advocate of breastfeeding . A manager at the Stour Centre, pictured, intervened when Miss Howes began breastfeeding her child saying a lifeguard had found the action 'offensive' Stopping a woman from breastfeeding in public is specifically outlawed by the Equality Act 2010, pictured . Emma Wood, chief executive of Ashford Leisure Trust, said: 'Ashford Leisure Trust fully supports breastfeeding at all its sites and understands the legal rights of mothers to do this. The Equality Act 2010 is a piece of litigation that protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. Under the Act it is against the law to discriminate against people who are pregnant or who have a child. People are protected when using a public service - such as a swimming pool in this case. According to the Act discrimination includes the following: . 'On this occasion it was believed there was a legitimate health and safety risk - ie, feeding actually taking place while both the mother and baby were in the water, and a suitable alternative area just a couple of metres away was suggested. 'We do of course apologise for any upset caused. The staff were concerned for the health and welfare of the baby. 'It may be that this concern was misplaced due to a misunderstanding of the situation but it was not intended to discriminate against the mother. 'It is clear that additional training is required and this is being arranged with Public Health for all staff to ensure there is an enhanced awareness and understanding of breastfeeding. We will also be working with experts and professionals to ensure that a suitable policy is produced.' Miss Howes said she is 'delighted' with the result and hopes other mothers won't be discriminated against in the way she was. Miss . Howes, whose daughter Connie is now 15 month-old, said: 'I am really . pleased but I am more pleased about the wider implications of it. 'The implication is that mothers won't be discriminated against in other places. 'My mum is a staunch advocate of breast feeding too and we are both midwifes. We both carried on and tried to make a difference. Miss Howes said she was pleased she won her case because it secured extra rights to breastfeed their children in public (picture posed by a model) Ms Howes, left, reached an out-of-court settlement after she claimed she had been discriminated against under the Equality Act 2010 when she was prevented from breastfeeding her daughter Connie, centre. 'I mean this has been happening all over the UK and I'm delighted to be able to set a precedent. 'I used to think people looked positively at breast feeding but then this happened to me and I heard of a lot of similar cases in the press. 'The feeling I got was that breastfeeding was okay as long as you do it secretly which I don't think is acceptable. 'I think there now needs to be a change in the law and make it a criminal offence to tell somebody they can't breastfeed. 'At the moment if somebody asks a person to leave then what can they do. If it's a criminal law then they can tell the police.'

"A female jogger out for a run in Austin, Texas, Thursday was arrested, handcuffed and hauled into a police cruiser screaming and in tears for allegedly failing to identify herself. The entire incident was caught on video recorded by Chris Quintero, a student at University of Texas who was sitting in a cafe across the street and witnessed the woman being taken into custody. The arrest took place just before 11am outside a fast-food eatery near the intersection of 24th Street and San Antonio Street in Austin. Scroll down for video . Busted: Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, is seen handcuffed and in tears following Thursday's arrest for a traffic violation in Austin . Caught on camera: Chris Quintero took pictures and video of the jogger's arrest; the college student said the 24-year-old crossed the street without waiting to the light to switch and was ordered to stop by police . Sporting a black crop top, shorts and toe sneakers, 24-year-old Amanda Jo Stephen was running across the street when an officer yelled for her to stop. According to Quintero, who saw the arrest play out from a nearby Starbucks, the jogger got caught in a police operation targeting jaywalkers, University of Texas' student newspaper The Daily Texan reported. Since Stephen had her headphones on, she allegedly didn't hear the officer and continued on her way. The officer quickly caught up with her and grabbed Stephen’s hand from behind, prompting her to push his hand away. Desperate pleas: A sobbing Stephen repeatedly told the officers that she did nothing wrong and was simply exercising . Lawbreaker: Austin PD said the woman has been charged with failure to identify herself to police and a class B traffic signal violation . An Austin police spokesperson told MailOnline Friday that Miss Stephen was handcuffed and taken into custody for failing to give her name to police. In Quintero's 2-minute video, the young woman with blond hair arranged in two braids in seen weeping on the ground with her hands restrained behind her back and two officers towering over her. At one point, the apprehended jogger notices Quintero taking pictures of her and declares: 'I was doing nothing wrong. I was crossing the street.' A moment later, a pair of uniformed cops, joined by two more cops on bikes, could be seen placing the sobbing woman into the back of a squad car, with her pleading and shrieking at the top of her lungs. ‘I didn’t do anything wrong! I didn’t do anything wrong! she said repeatedly. ‘I didn’t f***ing do anything wrong! I just crossed the street.’ Since going up on YouTube Thursday, Quintero's video has gone viral, drawing more than 17,000 views, and counting. Internet hit: Quintero's video showing the four burly man overpowering the slender young jogger has gone viral in a day . The Austin Police Department has denied that the officers seen in the video were specifically targeting jaywalkers, claiming instead that they were working 'pedestrian enforcement' to ensure traffic safety. The agency spokesperson told MailOnline Miss Stephen has been charged with failure to identify and a class B traffic signal violation. As of Friday, she was not listed as an inmate in the local jail, suggesting that she has been released on bond. 'Maybe the plus size cops should follow her lead, and go on a jog instead of wasting tax dollars on trivial matters... just a thought,' Quintero wrote in his blog.","Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, charged with failure to identify and traffic signal violation in Austin, Texas .

"It is the inspiration behind the world's most famous fictional girl's school. But after 132 years of only allowing girls through its doors, the private school which inspired  St Trinian's will soon be opening to boys. The Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, which inspired Ronald Searle's cartoons of delinquent girls in gym slips under an eccentric headmistress, is to break with tradition by teaching boys. Moving forward: The private girl's school which  provided the inspiration for the fictional boarding house St Trinian's is opening to boys for the first time in its 132-year history. Pupils from the school are pictured . Modern: The Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, which inspired Ronald Searle's cartoons of delinquent girls in gym slips under an eccentric headmistress, is to break with tradition by teaching boys . They will be able to join the junior school from September 2014 and the senior school, which opened in 1881, four years later. The girls and boys aged nine to 16 will be taught separately in most subjects, but join together for the creative arts and sport and will be able to eat and socialise together. Tricia Kelleher, principal of the Stephen Perse Foundation, a group of private schools in Cambridge which includes Perse Girls, said the 'time was right' to allow boys into the school. She added: 'The girls' senior school will continue to offer outstanding opportunities for learning, but will enjoy mutual benefits from interaction in a range of social, cultural and sporting activities afforded by the creation of the new boys' section. A scene from the 1960 film The Pure Hell At St Trinian's, starring George Cole and Joyce Grenfell . Inspiration: Searle published the first of his famous St Trinian's cartoons in the magazine Lilliput in 1941. This is a scene from the 2009 film St Trinian's 2: The Legend Of Fritton's Gold . 'We are very excited by the changes. We don't have any single sex private boys schools left in Cambridge . anymore so we are returning that choice to parents. 'I think it will make us an even stronger school.' Boys are already on the roll at the school's two pre-prep sites as well as the Stephen Perse Sixth Form College. Ms Kelleher said they are reacting to demand from parents, as well as would-be pupils. The late Ronald Searle, who died two years ago aged 91, was born and grew up in Cambridge and memories of its feisty school girls never left him. Historic: The school, pictured, says the time is right to allow boys to join . Popular: The school says it is reacting to demands from parents, as well as would-be pupils, by allowing boys to be taught there. Some of the school's current pupils are pictured . As a teenager at the Boys' Central School in Cambridge he remembered seeing the Perse girls going home from school. Searle published the first of his famous St Trinian's cartoons in the magazine Lilliput in 1941. Shortly afterwards he had to fulfil his military service and was captured in Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. He started drawing new cartoons after the war in 1946 but the content was much darker. They often showed school girls drinking, gambling and smoking and the school mistress was disreputable. Confirmation: This letter from Ronald Searle confirms that the Perse School was the inspiration for the St Trinian's films . Traditional: This image shows pupils at the Perse School in the 1950s . In the 1950s a series of St Trinian's comedy films were made and the characters were brought to a new generation of fans in 2007 in a film starring Lily Cole and Russell Brand. In 1993 Searle wrote to the school librarian at the Perse School and revealed the Perse Girls pupils were part of his inspiration for the St Trinian's cartoons. The letter said: 'As you know I was born in Cambridge and St Trinian's emerged from an amalgamation of local schoolgirls. 'My sister apart, I think we can say that the main influences were certainly the Perse and the Cambridge High School for Girls. 'The Perse School for Girls was a positive source of inspiration for St Trinian's but I hope the school won't hold that against me so many years after the crime.' Ms Kelleher added: 'I'm very proud that the school was the inspiration for St Trinian's and my feeling is that the criminality aside, the girls were independent, individual and feisty. 'We want our girls to be like that and now we want to offer that to boys too.'

"A Phoenix, Arizona father shot dead an unarmed stranger in the middle of a suburban Walmart Sunday, but police have not booked him because they say the shooting was in self-defense.

"These are the first pictures of water cannon ready for use on the streets of Britain this summer. The German-made weapon is at an Army base in Hampshire where, shielded from public view by several vast warehouses, police officers are being trained in its use. Dozens of Met officers have been travelling to Longmoor base, near Petersfield, every day over the past fortnight. Resistance: Police train with water cannon at Longmoor Army camp near Petersfield in Hampshire . Onlookers said policemen in riot helmets banged batons on plastic shields during gruelling drills. Meanwhile colleagues played the role of a mob of rioters who were drenched with cold water fired out in short bursts. The cannon, a custom-built Ziegler Wasserwerfer 9000, was quietly brought in from Northern Ireland ahead of the G8 talks next month. Up to 4,000 officers are being trained to use water cannon, ostensibly so they can work alongside colleagues across the Irish Sea at the talks at the Lough Erne resort at Enniskillen. However, with police and officials close to reaching a deal about the purchase of three cannon for the mainland, the officers’ skills will be invaluable beyond G8. Duck and cover: Met police officers have been traveling to the training facility for the past two weeks to learn how to use the new water cannon . Practice makes perfect: The picture shows a group of Met police during the training drill which saw officers banging batons on plastic shields . Fighting fit: Officers also played the role of the angry mob and had to withstand regular soakings as their colleagues practiced using the water cannon on human targets . The Home Office has signalled it approves of introducing water cannon ‘in principle’, but staff want more details about how exactly they will be used. Critics believe the machines are a step too far. Some police chiefs say they are unsuitable and human rights lawyers fear they symbolise a creep towards more militant policing. Calls for water cannon climaxed after the riots of the summer of 2011, which began in London and laid waste to parts of several cities. In the aftermath, Prime Minister David Cameron said ‘nothing is off the table’ to keep order in the streets. In a report, a senior Met officer concluded ‘water cannon would be valuable in a few rare situations’. A fleet of six water cannon was used against stone-throwing mobs during the Ulster Troubles and in the marching season, and the machines are in use on a large scale in Germany, Northern Ireland, Belgium and other parts of Europe.

Riot: Flashback to the 2011 troubles in London's Hackney during the riots . There have been reports of them causing serious injuries, including broken bones and a ruptured spleen. A protester was blinded in Stuttgart three years ago when he was hit full in the face by a blast of water. The Metropolitan Police, senior Whitehall officials and the Association of Chief Police Officers all played down the prospect of introducing water cannon to British streets. It is understood the Met wants control of two of the vehicles. Jenny Jones, a Green politician who scrutinises the Met, said the decision was being made ‘without any proper scrutiny’. The Met said talks with the Home Office were ongoing.","London Met police are being trained to use brand new water cannon .

"The unemployment rate rose in October to 7.9 per cent according to the latest U.S. Labour Department report – raising it above the level when President Barack Obama was sworn into office in January 2009. Shortly after taking office, Obama said . that if he failed to revive the economy in three years, he . would be looking at a ‘one-term proposition’. The September jobs report came as major a . surprise with unemployment rate dropping to 7.8 per cent, dipping below . eight per cent for the first time since February 2009, when it was 8.3 . per cent. Delicate moment: President Barack Obama speaks at a rally in Las Vegas yesterday during the fraught run-up to the election . On inauguration day in 2009, unemployment was 7.8 per cent. Employers added 171,000 jobs, with the overall rate rising because more people began looking for work. If the labour force participation rate was the same as when Obama took office, however, unemployment would be 10.6 per cent. Progress? The rate of unemployment has fluctuated over the past two years, but is still higher than it was when Obama took office . On the campaign trail, however, Obama has pleaded for more time. ‘We've made real progress these past four years,’ he said in Boulder, Colorado on Thursday night. ‘But, Colorado, we all know our work is not yet done. As long as there's a single American who wants a job and can't find one, our work is not done.’ It was the last monthly employment report before a general election on Tuesday that has largely been fought on the issue of jobs with Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, blasting Obama for the ailing economy and Obama blaming the situation on the ‘mess’ he inherited from President George W. Bush. While most voters have made up their mind about the economy, and many have already cast their ballots early, the rise in the unemployment rate will give Romney potentially crucial ammunition in the final four days of the 2012 campaign. The September jobs report was greeted with scepticism and even claims of conspiracy from some on the Right. Jack Welsh, former CEO of General Electric, said via Twitter: ‘Unbelievable jobs numbers…these Chicago guys will do anything.can’t debate so change numbers.’ There was no immediate reaction from Welch, whose comments ignited a firestorm and were denounced by the White House as ‘ludicrous’, to the October report. Romney said that the ‘increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill’. He added in a statement: ‘The jobless rate is higher than it was when President Obama took office, and there are still 23million Americans struggling for work. Crucial time: Republican candidate Mitt Romney, pictured today arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, said the increase in the unemployment rate was 'a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill¿ . Since President Obama took office four years ago, 67 per cent, or two-thirds, of new jobs have gone to legal and illegal immigrants, according to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies. Most of that growth in immigrant employment was due to new immigrants coming to the U.S. for work rather than immigrants already living in the country. There were 1.94million more immigrants employed in the third quarter of 2012 than at the start of 2009, when the president took office, compared with 938,000 hires among native citizens in the same time period. A large share of job growth was going to immigrants before Obama took office, but the president has taken steps to make it easier for foreign-born workers to land jobs in the U.S. In 2010 the Obama administration called on the U.S. Supreme Court to drop Arizona’s immigration law requiring employers to verify the legal status of new workers. The Supreme Court delivered a 5-3 decision upholding the law in 2011. ‘On Tuesday, America will make a choice between stagnation and prosperity. For four years, President Obama’s policies have crushed America’s middle class. ‘For four years, President Obama has told us that things are getting better and that we’re making progress. For too many American families, those words ring hollow. ‘We can do better. We can have real economic growth, create millions of good-paying jobs, and give middle-class families the security and opportunity they deserve. ‘When I’m president, I’m going to make real changes that lead to a real recovery, so that the next four years are better than the last.’ Job gains in previous months grew after being revised, with September’s 114,000 new jobs revised to 148,000 while August’s 142,000 was revised to 192,000. There have now been 25 consecutive months of jobs gains in the United States – something trumpeted by the Obama campaign - but the increases have been not been enough to absorb new people entering the work force. About 12million people are without work, two out of five of whom have been out of a job for more than six months.","Unemployment rate was 7.8 per cent on inauguration day in 2009 .

"A family-run, dry-cleaning business has come under fire for putting pro-life messages on wire coat hangers. Springdale Cleaners, which has ten branches in Ohio, has for five years returned clean clothes to customers with a paper hanger cover which reads: 'Choose Life' and has a picture of the owner's baby granddaughter. The business is owned by Paul Dehler, 66, and his wife Diane who have run the firm since 1969. Statement: Video blogger Ben Dudley holds up the 'pro-life' hanger used by Springdale Cleaners in Ohio . His son Paul Dehler Jr told MailOnline today that his father had introduced the coat hangers because his sister is a member of a pro-life group and they asked about advertising. Mr Dehler Jr, whose daughter features on the hanger, said: 'If anything it has helped the business. We have had letters saying people switched their business to us because of the hangers.' He added that he did not believe that the hangers were offensive or insensitive and that they had a right to their say. The coat hanger is long associated with the self-induced abortion, performed without medical staff and often by dangerous means. The practice is for the most part illegal even when abortion is legal, due the the extreme risk of death. Women have been known to attempt to remove the fetus with a coat hanger by inserting it into the uterus through the cervix. Resulting puncture wounds can lead to septicemia. A 1968 study found around 1.2 million illegal abortions took place each year in the U.S. The landmark supreme court decision of Roe v Wade made abortion widely available in the U.S.  It was decided that a woman's right to abortion must be balanced with protecting prenatal life and protecting women's health. Mr Dehler Jr said that although the hanger cover is being redesigned the 'Choose Life' statement would remain. The coat hanger has long been a symbol of 'back-alley' abortions. Pro-choice supporters have used hangers in their campaigns . to highlight the danger of banning abortion and show what desperate measures have been taken in the past. One blogger . called it the 'worst marketing decision ever' while on a Facebook . pro-choice page, one user Lilithe Magdalene said she wrote to the . cleaners about the hangers being 'beyond twisted'.

"Hostess is betting on a sweet comeback for Twinkies when they return to shelves next month. The company that went bankrupt after an acrimonious fight with its unionized workers last year is back up and running under new owners and a leaner structure. It says it plans to have Twinkies and other snack cakes back on shelves starting July 15. Based on the outpouring of nostalgia sparked by its demise, Hostess is expecting a blockbuster return next month for Twinkies and other sugary treats, such as CupCakes and Donettes. The company says the cakes will taste the same but that the boxes will now bare the tag line 'The Sweetest Comeback In The History Of Ever'. Sweet: Months after fans mourned the loss of the beloved Twinkie, its new owners say the sponge cake snack will return July 15 as part of 'The Sweetest Comeback In The History Of Ever.' 'A lot of impostor products have come to the market while Hostess has been off the shelves,' says Daren Metropoulos, a principal of the investment firm Metropoulos & Co., which teamed up with Apollo Global Management to buy a variety of Hostess snacks. Hostess Brands Inc. was struggling for years before it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in early 2012. Workers blamed the troubles on years of mismanagement, as well as a failure of executives to invest in brands to keep up with changing tastes. The company said it was weighed down by higher pension and medical costs than its competitors, whose employees weren't unionized. To steer it through its bankruptcy reorganization, Hostess hired restructuring expert Greg Rayburn as its CEO. But Rayburn ultimately failed to reach a contract agreement with its second largest union. In November, he blamed striking workers for crippling the company's ability to maintain normal production and announced that Hostess would liquidate. The shuttering triggered a rush on Hostess snack cakes, with stores selling out of the most popular brands within hours. About 15,000 unionized workers lost their jobs in the aftermath. Bankrupt: Hostess Brands Inc. filed for bankrupcy in 2012, sparking fears Twinkies would no longer be sold . In unwinding its business, Hostess sold off its brands in chunks to different buyers. Its major bread brands including Wonder were sold to Flowers Foods, which makes Tastykakes. McKee Foods, which makes Little Debbie snack cakes, snapped up Drake's Cake, which includes Devil Dogs and Yodels. Metropoulos & Co. and Apollo bought Twinkies and other Hostess cakes for $410 million. Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black, is known for buying troubled brands then selling them for a profit; its investments include fast-food chains Carl's Jr. and Hardee's. Metropoulos & Co., which has revamped then sold off brands including Chef Boyardee and Bumble Bee, also owns Pabst Brewing Co. That could mean some cross-promotional marketing is in store. 'There is certainly a natural association with the two,' Metropoulos said. 'There could be some opportunities for them to seen together.' The trimmed-down Hostess Brands LLC has a far less costly operating structure than the predecessor company. Some of the previous workers were hired back, but they're no longer unionized. Hostess will also now deliver to warehouses that supply retailers, rather than delivering directly to stores, said Rich Seban, the president of Hostess who previously served as chief operating officer. That will greatly expand its reach, letting it deliver to dollar stores and nearly all convenience stores in the U.S. Previously, he said Hostess was only able to reach about a third of the country's 150,000 convenience stores. Return: New owners of the Twinkie brand said they are considering marketing a 'crunchy' or flavored version of the popular sponge cake . Production was also consolidated, from 11 bakery plants to four - one each in Georgia, Kansas, Illinois and Indiana. The headquarters were moved from Texas to Kansas City, Mo., where Hostess was previously based and still had some accounting offices. In the months since they vanished from shelves, the cakes have been getting a few touchups as well. For the CupCakes, the company is now using dark cocoa instead of milk chocolate to give them a richer, darker appearance. Seban stressed that the changes were to improve the cakes, not to cut costs. Prices for the cakes will remain the same; a box of 10 Twinkies will cost $3.99. Looking ahead, Seban sees Hostess expanding its product lineup. He noted that Hostess cakes are known for three basic textures: the spongy cake, the creamy filling and the thicker icing. But he said different textures - such as crunchy - could be introduced, as well as different flavors. 'We can have some fun with that mixture,' he said. He also said there are many trendy health attributes the company could tap into, such as gluten-free, added fiber, low sugar and low sodium. During bankruptcy proceedings, Hostess had said that its overall sales had been declining, although the company didn't give a breakout on the performance of individual brands. But Seban is confident Twinkies will have staying power beyond its re-launch. As for the literal shelf-life, Seban is quick to refute the snack cake's fabled indestructibility. 'Forty-five days - that's it,' he said. 'They don't last forever.'","Hostess Brands Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 2012 following fight with unions .

"Campaigners have called for a boycott of Barilla, the world’s biggest pasta maker, after the company said they would never feature gay people in their advertisements. Company chairman Guido Barilla provoked outrage when he said that his idea of the ‘traditional families’ where the woman played a central part was ‘sacred’. If gay people didn’t like it they could eat another brand of pasta, he said. Scroll down for video . Boycott: The chairman of Barilla pasta said he would never feature a same-sex couple or homosexual family in the company's advertisements . He said: ‘I would never do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect, but because I don’t think we are like them. 'Ours is a traditional family where the woman has a fundamental role. ‘ . Mr Barilla told Italian radio Radio 24: ‘Our concept is not that of a gay family. Worldwide fury: Mr Barilla provoked further anger when he added that if gay people did not approve of his views 'they could eat another brand of pasta' 'For us, the concept of the nuclear family is a fundamental value of the company.' When the interviewer pointed out that gay people also eat pasta he said: ‘Okay, if they like our pasta and our branding let them eat it, otherwise they can choose another pasta. ‘You can’t always please everyone. ‘ . Mr Barilla also remarked that he was against gay adoption although he did support gay marriage. The comments followed the launch of an initiative by Parliament Speaker, Laura Boldrini, on the role of women in advertising, in particular the prevalence of mothers serving the family at the table. Aurelio Mancuso, from the campaign group Equality of Italy, called the remarks 'an offensive provocation ' and demanded an immediate boycott of Barilla products. As a wave of Italian MPs threatened to resign in support of Silvio Berlusconi, openly gay parliamentarian Alessandro Zan said: ‘I adhere to the boycott of Barilla and I urge other MPs, at least those who do not resign, to do the same ‘ . The comments caused a storm on the web with Twitter #boicottabarilla (boycott Barilla) trending.

"Hostess Brands and its striking union have agreed to mediation talks to try and resolve their differences, meaning the Texas-based baker of Ho Hos, Twinkies and Wonder Bread isn't going out of business just yet. The news came Monday after Hostess moved to liquidate and sell off its assets in bankruptcy court citing a crippling strike last week. The bankruptcy judge hearing the case said Monday that the parties haven't gone through the critical step of mediation and asked the lawyer for the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, which has been on strike since November 9, to ask his client, who wasn't present, if the union would agree to participate. Twenty four hours to save Twinkies: Producer Hostess Brands and unions have agreed to mediation talks . Within hours of Friday's announcement that Hostess was going out of business, there was a rush on buying their products . The judge noted that the bakery union, which represents about 30 percent of Hostess workers, went on strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer, even though it had never filed an objection to it. ‘Many people, myself included, have serious questions as to the logic behind this strike,’ said Judge Robert Drain, who heard the case in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York in White Plains, N.Y. ‘Not to have gone through that step leaves a huge question mark in this case.’ Monday's hearing had been expected to . be the first step towards Hostess selling its well-known brands such as . Twinkies, Wonder Bread, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos. But the hearing was quickly adjourned until Wednesday as the judge urged the parties to hold private talks to find a solution. Hostess and the union agreed to the mediation talks, which are expected to begin on Tuesday. In an interview after the hearing on Monday, CEO Gregory Rayburn said that the two parties will have to agree to contract terms within 24 hours of the Tuesday meeting since it is costing $1 million a day in overhead costs to wind down operations. But even if a contract agreement is reached, it is not clear if all 33 Hostess plants will go back to being operational. ‘We didn't think we had a runway, but the judge just created a 24-hour runway,’ for the two parties to come to an agreement, Rayburn said. Shortage: Hostress Brands quickly sold out after news spread that the company was going out of business . Hostess Brands and its striking union have agreed to mediation talks after an intervention by a bankruptcy judge . Hostess, weighed down by debt, management turmoil, rising labor costs and the changing tastes of America, decided on Friday that it no longer could make it through a conventional Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. Instead, the company, which is based in Irving, Texas, asked the court for permission to sell assets and go out of business. It's not the sequence of events that the maker of Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Ho's envisioned when it filed for bankruptcy in January, its second Chapter 11 filing in less than a decade. The company, who said that it was saddled with costs related to its unionized workforce, had hoped to emerge with stronger financials. It brought on Rayburn as a restructuring expert and was working to renegotiate its contract with labor unions. But Rayburn wasn't able to reach a deal with the bakery union. The company, which had been contributing $100 million a year in pension costs for workers, offered workers a new contract that would've slashed that to $25 million a year, in addition to wage cuts and a 17 percent reduction in health benefits. But the bakery union decided to strike. Was it all in vain? On Friday Michelle Craft bought $100 worth of Hostess treats in Denver, but now it looks like the company might not go out of business afterall . Demand: there were long lines outside the Hostess store in Denver when the company announced its demise on Friday . By that time, the company had reached a contract agreement with its largest union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which urged the bakery union to hold a secret ballot on whether to continue striking. Although many bakery workers decided to cross picket lines this week, Hostess said it wasn't enough to keep operations at normal levels. Rayburn said that Hostess was already operating on razor thin margins and that the strike was the final blow. The company's announcement on Friday that it would move to liquidate prompted people across the country to rush to stores and stock up on their favorite Hostess treats. Many businesses reported selling out of Twinkies within hours and the spongy yellow cakes turned up for sale online for hundreds of dollars. Even if Hostess goes out of business, its popular brands will likely find a second life after being snapped up by buyers. The company says several potential buyers have expressed interest in the brands. Although Hostess' sales have been declining in recent years, the company still does about $2.5 billion in business each year. Twinkies alone has brought in $68 million so far this year. Outrage: Diana McKinley, a 33-year employee of Hostess, pickets on Thursday in Sacramento, California .

"Off-duty cops are no longer able to carry their weapons to NFL stadiums according to a new policy. Texas is the only state in which an . off-duty cop can carry his gun into the stadium. When checking in, a cop . can use a special gate and inform stadium officials of where they will be seated with their gun. The head of Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Bob Cherry, is outraged by the NFL's decision. Cherry believes that post 9-11 terrorist times call for more security all the time--even off-duty. NFL policy no longer allows off duty cops to carry guns on them in stadiums such as The Baltimore Ravens Stadium pictured here . The NFL statement to WBAL Radio says that off-duty cops at the game should be treated the same as spectators. Since off duty cops are not briefed on game day law enforcement planing strategy, their carrying a gun can be dangerous. Unlike cops on duty, off-duty cops are permitted to drink alcohol at the event. Alcohol can cause impaired judgement and therefore makes an off-duty cop with a gun a liability.Bob Cherry's reponse was, 'Many police officers across the country who don't drink at these games and are suitably armed and actually need to be armed.'According to Cherry, a month ago the Ravens allowed for off-duty cops to carry guns into the stadium but not retired cops.He was happy that the team was trying to meet his demands. Baltimore off-duty cops are actually required to carry guns on them at all times. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (left) was met with retaliation from Baltimore police department officials like Bob Cherry (right) who disagree with the gun policy . Cherry's solution to the issue is to have gun lockers installed in the stadium so that cops can securely disarm before entering the stadium and get their gun back once they leave. The NFL expressed their appreciation for law enforcement officials but believes that limiting the number of weapons in the stadium benefits everyone's safety. There are already assigned and armed officers in the stadium who have been briefed on the safety protocols designed for each stadium. Cherry is still pushing for the NFL to change their rule. 'You have many officers who do have season tickets, will show up at a Ravens game because they are in the city and they work for Baltimore City Police they are required to be suitably armed. Now the NFL says well you can't bring your weapon into our stadium,'said Cherry. Jeff Follmer, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association, is also disappointed by the no gun policy.Cherry asked that any citizen or officer who agrees that off-duty cops should be able to have a gun in the stadium contact NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to tell him they disagree with his new policy.

"A young man who was convicted of shooting his mother to death as a teen and sent to a mental hospital for years was still able to buy 15 guns once he was released. Chris Oberender was convicted of killing his mother in 1995 when he was 14-years-old, and he was sentenced to a mental hospital until he was 21-years-old. Now he is awaiting jail in Minnesota for buying illegal firearms since he is banned from owning guns because he is a convicted felon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jailed: Chris Oberender is in jail awaiting sentencing for his illegal firearms charges after he purchased 15 guns even though he is a convicted felon . His criminal history is the only reason why his purchases were illegal, since he complied with other Minnesota laws by applying for a gun permit in 2011 and was approved because the court records were incomplete. The case comes as President Obama is pushing for universal background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault rifles in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Oberender was caught and now faces jail time is because Watertown Township Sheriff Jim Olson recognized his name in daily police reports. Oberender caught the attention of the now-greying sheriff because the murder case was one of his first as a young detective. He told CBS that he was immediately concerned and checked Facebook to make sure it was the same person, only to find that the now-32-year-old Oberender had proudly posted pictures of his firearms on his profile. 'He can't have guns. Chris Oberender should not have guns,' Mr Olson told CBS. Jogging memories: Sheriff Jim Olson recognized Oberender's name from when he was just a teen and killed his mother and Olson was a young detective on the case . An arsenal: Police found 15 firearms (pictured) at Oberender's house after the sheriff raised concerns . In what Mr Olson calls a 'chilling' twist, police found a letter that he wrote to his dead mother while they were searching his home, which read: 'I am so homicide. What is wrong with me. I think about killing all the time.' Oberender remains in jail waiting on his illegal firearms possession charges, but this is one of cases authorities fear most. The courts failed to keep complete records for Oberender, meaning that his finger prints and legal record were not present when he applied for a background check in 2011. Proud: Oberender had a picture of his guns displayed on his Facebook profile page . Like 168,000 other people in the state, incomplete records mean that permits must be issued if requested and they cannot be held back on account of the court's mishaps. Lucida Jesson, the commissioner of the Department of Human Services, said that her office has to be specifically asked to do a full run of an applicant's file during the permit process, and a check is not always automatic. In this case, her office was never asked to check his health record, for if they were, police would have been alerted to his forced stay in the mental hospital. 'In this case, we were lucky. No one was hurt through the good actions of local law enforcement,' Ms Jesson said.

"The number of gay and bisexual characters on scripted broadcast network TV is at its highest-ever level in the season ahead, according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. The total on cable television is also going up. The 17th-annual 'Where We Are on TV' report released on Friday by GLAAD found that 4.4 per cent of actors appearing regularly on prime-time network drama and comedy series during the 2012-13 season will portray lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender characters. This is up from 2.9 per cent in 2011, which saw a dip in what had been a growing annual trend. The study reviewed 97 scripted TV programs scheduled to air in the upcoming season on the broadcast networks, counting a total of 701 series regular characters. The study found that 31 of them are LGBT characters. Number one: ABC feature more LGBT characters than any other network. ABC's 'Modern Family' (pictured: the cast at the Emmys in September) showcases the evolution of the American family and features a gay couple . ABC has the highest amount with 10 out of 194, or 5.2 per cent, of their regular characters identified as LGBT. After leading last year, FOX ranks second with six LGBT characters out of 118 total series regulars, or 5.1 percent. CBS was saluted as the most-improved network, with four out of 142 LGBT series regulars, or 2.8 percent, up from 0.7 percent last year. Among CBS's new fall series is 'Partners,' a comedy about two childhood friends and business partners, one of whom is gay and in a relationship. The network's lineup represents 'an authentic and conscious effort by CBS to improve its diversity,' the study said. Regular gay and lesbian characters on what the study termed 'mainstream' cable television has also risen this season to 35, up from 29 last season. Most inclusive: For cable, HBO's 'True Blood' was ranked number one given it features six LGBT characters (pictured: actors Michael McMillian, left, and Denis O'Hare in a scene from 'True Blood') Among those networks, Showtime leads with 12 LGBT characters. The study also cited HBO, FX, Adult Swim, ABC Family, MTV, Syfy and TeenNick. The HBO drama 'True Blood' remains cable's most inclusive series, featuring six LGBT characters. On broadcast TV, male LGBT characters continue to outweigh female characters, 55.5 per cent to 44.5 per cent, the study found. NBC: The Peacock Network's new sitcom 'The New Normal' features a gay couple as well . Compared to last year, African-American representation has grown from 9.9 per cent to 12 per cent, while Hispanic representation has decreased from 5.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent. 'It is vital for networks to weave complex and diverse story lines of LGBT people in the different programs they air,' said GLAAD President Herndon Graddick. 'More and more Americans have come to accept their LGBT family members, friends, co-workers and peers, and as audiences tune into their favorite programs, they expect to see the same diversity of people they encounter in their daily lives.'","4.4 per cent of actors appearing on prime-time series during the .

"In training: Terrance Ganaway earns $390,000 a year as a running back for the St. Louis Rams . Most professional footballers while away the off-season lounging by a pool, taking luxury holidays or topping up their ample paychecks by endorsing big-brand products on television. But one NFL player has cast aside such trappings of the modern-day game - and swapped his helmet for a hairnet to moonlight as a $7.50-an-hour dogsbody in a sandwich shop. St. Louis Rams running back Terrance Ganaway, who earns the minimum rookie salary of $390,000, fills subs, wipes tables and sweeps the floors at Jimmy John's in Waco, Texas. 'I'm on the line that makes the . sandwiches,' he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'I bake bread, take the cashier spot. 'I had to sweep the other day. Clean the tables. I . mean all types of stuff. Slice the meat. Wrap the meat.' He says he took the unlikely three-nights-a-week part-time job after joking on Twitter that he had too much free time and wanted a pastime to keep him busy. But one enterprising restaurant manager of the fast-food chain called his bluff and offered him a job - which Ganaway gratefully accepted. 'I just wanted to stay fit, stay out of trouble and really just try to save money and not spend a lot of money,' Ganaway told the newspaper. But the player, who played just three games for the Rams last season, said he was surprised by all the attention his new job has got him. 'Never intended for the story to grow.

"A vintage motorbike which once set a world speed record has sold for an astonishing £113,500 at auction. The 1952 Vincent 998cc Black Shadow is a classic machine from a bygone age when Britain ruled the motorcycle world. It was used in world record speed trials in Montlhery, France, in May 1952, where the bike set a six-hour record at more than 100mph - an incredible achievement for the time. This Vincent Black Shadow motorbike, which once set a world speed record, has sold for £113,500 at auction . The vintage bike got its name from the fact the entire vehicle was painted black . The fully restored, ex-works machine . had formed part of the Vincent factory's bid to set a new 24-hour speed record. Although mechanical failures . prevented the challenge from being successful, the British team returned home . with eight new records. The tiny British company was so far ahead of its time that it wasn't until the 1970s that Japanese manufacturers came along with faster production machines. The Vincent Black Shadow - so called because the entire vehicle was painted black - was bought by motorcycle dealer George Petch, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, in 1970 and he rode it for a few years before taking it apart for restoration. The 1952 Vincent 998cc Black Shadow was used in world record speed trials in Montlhery, France, in May 1952 (above), where the bike set a six-hour record at more than 100mph .

Engine: 998cc, V-twin overheadPower: 55.74 HP, 5,500 rpmTop speed: 124 mphFirst produced: 1948 . Mr Petch, now aged 70, planned to restore it to its former glory, but it remained in pieces for another 25 years. It wasn't until he approached a motorcycle expert 11 years ago that the classic machine was restored. His bike was the top-selling lot at the International Classic Motorcycle Show at the weekend. It finally attracted the whopping closing bid at the Bonhams auction, held at the Staffordshire County Showground on Sunday. Ben Walker, Head of the Bonhams Motorcycle Department, said: 'Once again, our auction at the International Classic proved to be exactly that, with interest from bidders from across the globe.' The Vincent Black Shadow was bought by motorcycle dealer George Petch, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, in 1970 and he rode it for a few years before taking it apart for restoration . Among other auction highlights was a 1914 Indian Model F once owned by legendary Hollywood actor Steve McQueen .

Tickets were sold for five pence each, or 50p for a book of 10, and second and third prizes respectively were 10 and five gallons of oil. An eclectic selection of 30 machines owned by the late Clifford Jones proved popular with bidders, selling for a total of more than £175,000. The collection featured a number of 1950s 'cafe racers' - a favourite of Rockers in the early 1960 who would use them to travel from one transport cafe to another - as well as much modern-day racing and superbike machinery. Meanwhile in the automobilia section, two Akai Yamaha race helmets worn by the legendary Barry Sheene in the 1980s fetched a combined total of £10,000. Mr Walker added: 'Record-breaking machines like the 1952 Vincent Black Shadow and the movie star charisma of Steve McQueen were among the draws for the crowd, and there was fierce competition for the Ducatis in the collection of the late Clifford Jones.'","Bike did six hours at over 100mph at speed trials in Montlhery, France .

"Twinkie fans can breathe a sigh of relief as its owners Hostess Brands Inc. revealed the iconic cake is likely to return to shelves in the coming months. The company's other products, including Wonder Bread and Devil Dogs, are also set to return to market but probably not under the same owners as Twinkies. Hostess said in bankruptcy court on Friday that it is narrowing down the bids it received for its brands and expects to sell off its snack cakes and bread to separate buyers. Twinkies manufacturer Hostess has been bought out in a $410million dollar deal, it was announced this week . The testimony came from an investment banker for Hostess, which is in the process of liquidating. A likely suitor has emerged for the namesake Hostess brand, which includes Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos, along with Dolly Madison cakes, which includes Coffee Cakes and Zingers, said Joshua Scherer of Perella Weinberg Partners. He said another viable bid was made for Drake's cakes, which includes Devil Dogs, Funny Bones and Yodels. That bidder also wants to buy the Drake's plant in Wayne, N.J., which Scherer said is the country's only kosher bakery plant. Additional bids have been submitted . for its bread brands, which include Wonder and Home Pride. Hostess . expects to file binding 'stalking horse' bids for many of its brands in . January. Iconic: Some of the company's other big names, including Wonder Bread could also be back on sale soon . Those filings would be followed by a four-week auction process to allow competing bids. Scherer said the auctions could be very . active for some of the brands, given the number of parties that have . expressed interest. Sales could be completed by as early as mid-March. About 30 plants could also be sold with the brands, Scherer said, with six plants, several warehouses and a fleet of trucks likely to be closed or scrapped. Hostess has hired a firm Hilco to act . as a sales agent for those additional assets; the firm will also give . Hostess a $30 million loan to maintain operations during its . liquidation, which is expected to take about a year. Hostess, . based in Irving, Texas, has said potential buyers include major . packaged food companies and national retailers, such as big-box . retailers and supermarkets. Factory line: Workers prepare Hostess Twinkies for packaging at the Interstate Bakeries Corporation facility in Illinois - production had stopped after liquidation proceedings began . The company has stressed it needs to . move quickly in the sale process to capitalize on the outpouring of . nostalgia sparked by its bankruptcy. To . begin winding down its operations late last month, Hostess had said it . would retain about 3,000 workers to shutter plants and perform other . tasks. On Friday, an attorney for Hostess said in court that figure was . down to about 1,100 employees. The . liquidation of Hostess ultimately means the loss of about 18,000 jobs, . not including those shed in the years leading to the company's failure. CEO Greg Rayburn, who was hired as a restructuring expert earlier this . year, is earning $125,000 a month. Hostess has been in the process of selling off all it's brand after going into receivership in November . The company's demise came after years of management turmoil and turnover, with workers saying the company failed to invest in updating its snack cakes and breads. Hostess filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in less than a decade this January, citing steep costs associated with its unionized workforce. The company was able to reach a new contract agreement with its largest union, the Teamsters, the bakers union rejected the terms and went on strike Nov. 9. A week later, Hostess announced its plans to liquidate, saying the strike crippled its ability to maintain normal production. Although Hostess sales have been declining over the years, they still clock in at between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion a year. When asked how much the brands are expected to fetch from buyers, Scherer said he would rather not say.","Hostess Brands Inc. said in bankruptcy court on Friday that it is narrowing down the bids it received for its brands .
