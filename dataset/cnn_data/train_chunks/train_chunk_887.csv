"By . Reuters . Two mosquito-borne diseases - dengue fever and chikungunya - are posing a serious threat to Florida and residents should take steps to control mosquito populations to try to limit the danger, a leading health expert said on Wednesday. The Florida Department of Health, in its latest weekly report, said that through last week dengue fever had been confirmed in 24 people in Florida and chikungunya confirmed in 18 people. Both are viral diseases spread by mosquito bites. All of the infected people in Florida have traveled to the Caribbean or South America and could have become infected there, according to Walter Tabachnick, director of the Florida Medical Entomological Laboratory in Vero Beach, which is part of the University of Florida. Epidemiologists are worried that mosquitoes in Florida may have picked up dengue fever and chikungunya by biting infected people, which could kick off an epidemic in the state . A Dominican doctor observes Aedes aegypti mosquitos, which can spread the dengue fever . Epidemiologists are worried that mosquitoes in Florida may have picked up the diseases by biting infected people, which could kick off an epidemic in the state, Tabachnick said. 'The threat is greater than I've seen in my lifetime,' said Tabachnick, who has worked in the field for 30 years. 'Sooner or later, our mosquitoes will pick it up and transmit it to us. That is the imminent threat,' he added. Tabachnick urged the public to eliminate standing water including in buckets and rain barrels where mosquitoes can breed. 'If there is public apathy and people don't clean up the yards, we're going to have a problem,' Tabachnick said. Walter Tabachnick, director of the Florida Medical Entomological Laboratory, said that the threat is greater than he has seen in his lifetime . Dengue is potentially fatal, and both diseases cause serious and lingering symptoms. The most common symptoms of chikungunya infection are fever and joint pain, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tabachnick said the last statewide epidemics in Florida of dengue occurred in the 1930s. Localized epidemics of dengue occurred in 2013 in a small neighborhood in Jensen Beach where 24 people were infected, and in 2009 and 2010 in Key West where 28 people were infected, according to state and federal reports. The Caribbean Public Health Agency said this week that authorities in 18 Caribbean countries or territories had reported more than 100,000 confirmed or suspected cases of chikungunya. In the Dominican Republic, where health officials reported more than 53,000 suspected cases, hospitals in hard-hit areas are treating hundreds of new patients per day.","The public should eliminate standing water including in buckets and rain barrels where mosquitoes can breed .

"By . David Williams . A senior Syrian forensic medicine expert with evidence that President Bashar al-Assad's administration used chemical weapons in an attack in March has defected to Turkey, the opposition claimed today. Abdeltawwab Shahrour, head of the forensic medicine committee in Aleppo, Syria's second city, was said last night to be preparing to make the evidence public - a move that could help to provide powerful backing for those in the U.S. administration supporting military action against the Assad regime. He was the civilian in charge of the chemical weapons programme's medical and forensic science department so potentially is a hugely significant figure in any investigations into the use of nerve gas. It also emerged today that the regime in Damascus is hiding military hardware and shifting troops out of bases into civilian areas as the threat of American air strikes looms. Horror: A father grieves by the body of his child after the chemical attack in the suburbs of Damascus which killed hundreds of people . This picture from Syrian opposition's Shaam News Network shows bodies of children wrapped in shrouds as Syrian rebels claim they were killed in a gas attack by pro-government forces in Damascus . Dr Shahrour was reported to have been kidnapped from his home in Aleppo on August 16, five days before the Damascus attack, but this may have been a false trail designed to allow his family to be smuggled out of the country safely. Claims of the defection followed rumours that an even more senior figure had defected. The main Western-backed opposition group . says that during the buildup last week to what seemed like an imminent . U.S. attack, the army moved troops as well as rocket launchers, . artillery and other heavy weapons into residential neighborhoods in . cities nationwide. The evidence is alleged to have smuggled to Istanbul does not relate to the most recent attacks in the suburbs of Damascus that killed up to 1,700 on August 21 sparking British and U.S. calls for military strikes but to an earlier incident. At least 26 people died in what was alleged to be a chemical weapons attack in the Aleppo suburb of Khan al-Assal on March 19 - a shelling that killed several government soldiers at a checkpoint and both sides blamed on one another. It is said to have been the first time that chemical weapons had been used in the two year civil war. Grim tasks: Activists wear gas masks as they look for dead bodies and check for chemical weapon in the Zamalka area . Opposition officials said last night . Dr Shahrour had documents proving that a chemical weapons attack took . place and eye-witness accounts from police authorities that contradicted . the administration's version of events. It is unclear whether he had any evidence relating to the Damascus attacks. Three Damascus residents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, confirmed the army movments into residential areas. One man said two members of the elite Republican Guards broke into an empty house he owns and showed him an official document stating they were authorized to do so because Syria is at war. A woman in another area said soldiers moved into a school next to her house. This August 24 picture shows a Syrian army soldieron a street in the Jobar neighborhood of Damascus, Syria. The regime's forces are reportedly moving from bases to residential areas . A U.S. official confirmed there are indications that the Syrian regime is taking steps to move some of its military equipment and bolster protection for defense facilities. The official, who was not authorized to discuss intelligence matters and spoke on condition of anonymity, said that at this point, the U.S. has the information it needs to maintain a good handle on what the regime is doing to prepare. The trend inside Syria is likely to continue in the coming days now that the regime has won a reprieve with President Barack Obama's decision to seek congressional approval for military action. 'The Syrian regime knows there are 30-40 potential targets for U.S. airstrikes, and they have had ample time to prepare,' said Hisham Jaber, a retired Lebanese army general and director of the Middle East Center for Studies and Political Research in Beirut. 'Half of them, if not more, have been evacuated, moved or camouflaged. This is the natural thing to do.' A team of U.N. experts who visited Syria last month to investigate allegations of the use of chemicals weapons had originally planned to visit Khan al-Assal but ended up focusing on a much larger apparent poison gas attack near the Syrian capital. A Free Syrian Army fighter walks through a hole in a wall near Hanano Barracks in Aleppo today . Russia, which alongside Iran is Syria's closest ally and chief arms supplier, said in July its own scientific analysis indicated the attack had involved the nerve agent sarin and had most likely been carried out by the rebels. Both sides deny using chemical weapons. Dr Shahrour was reported to have been kidnapped from his home in regime-held Aleppo on August 16, five days before the Damascus attack but this may have been a false trail designed to allow his family to be smuggled out of the country safely. News of the defection followed rumours . that an even more senior figure, a general from the Assad family's . Alawite sect, had defected but it is not clear whether that was a . separate case, or a case of mistaken identity. Shahrour's testimony could help to provide powerful backing for those in the U.S. administration supporting military action against the Assad regime. Pictured today, an F/A-18F Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea . Dr Shahrour was expected to reveal the details of the attack during a press conference in Turkey but Syrian National Council spokesperson Khaled Saleh said he was unable to appear due to 'security concerns'. Mr Saleh added that the national council has received information in the last few days that three government convoys were carrying chemical weapons and one had reached a military airport. He said: 'We have serious concerns based on the information that we have received from sources inside the Assad army who are sympathetic to the revolution that Assad might be considering using those chemical weapons against innocent civilians.' Activists say the nerve agent Sarin was used in the alleged chemical weapons attack in Damascus. Sarin is colourless, tasteless and odourless, unlike mustard gas which smells of rotten onions or garlic. It is one of the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Once a person has breathed in Sarin, death can occur within one to 10 minutes if there is no treatment. If it is drunk, the victim can survive for up to 18 hours. A fraction of an ounce of the nerve agent on the skin can be fatal. Exposure to the gas causes pupils to shrink to pinpoint sizes and foaming at the lips. Symptoms include paralysis, loss of consciousness and respiratory failure. Treatment needs to be given straight away and antidotes include Atropine and pralidoxime chloride. Syria is believed to have one of the largest arsenals in the world of chemical weapons, including Sarin and mustard gas.","Influential chemical weapons specialist has 'smuggled evidence to Turkey'

Police have arrested two British men and are hunting a third after a holidaymaker plunged 50 feet from a luxury fifth-floor hotel in the upmarket Costa del Sol resort of Marbella. The unnamed British tourist was seriously ill in hospital last night after the mystery incident. Local media reports said the man had been thrown out of a window at the four-star Hotel Senator near Marbella town centre. Plunge: Police have arrested two British men and are hunting a third after a holidaymaker plunged 50 feet from the Hotel Senator in the upmarket Costa del Sol resort of Marbella . Police confirmed they were investigating the incident, which happened around 8pm on Saturday, and that two people had been arrested. A source said: 'As far as we are aware, all four including the injured man, are Brits. 'The circumstances surrounding this incident are still being investigated.' The injured man is understood to have been staying at the hotel with a friend. He is said to have plunged four floors from the fifth floor of the hotel to a first-floor terrace during a row which occurred after the arrival of two other Brits. The man police are hunting is one of those two Brits. Treatment: The injured man is being treated at the nearby Costa del Sol Hospital. He is thought to have suffered head injuries although remarkably has no broken bones . All four are understood to be under 30, although their ages and names have not been released. The injured Brit is being treated at the nearby Costa del Sol Hospital. He is thought to have suffered head injuries although remarkably has no broken bones. A report in one local paper that he had died in hospital was dismissed by a source close to the inquiry as false. Staff at the Senator Hotel, a four-star spa hotel on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile overlooking the Med, declined to comment. A receptionist said: ‘None of the bosses are around today.

"By . Gerard Couzens . A British fugitive accused of helping two violent robbers escape by attacking a prison van as they travelled to court, has been arrested in Benidorm. Paul Taylor was detained by armed police as he ate at a terrace cafe with friends. An international arrest warrant was issued for Taylor after the spectacular April 30 2013 rush-hour raid on a prison van carrying Ryan MacDonald, 21, and Stevie McMullen, 32, to Manchester Crown Court from Britain's first privately financed prison HMP Altcourse in Merseyside. A British fugitive accused of helping two violent robbers escape by attacking a prison van as they travelled to court, has been arrested in Benidorm . An international arrest warrant was issued for Paul Taylor after the spectacular April 30 2013 rush-hour raid on a prison van carrying Ryan MacDonald, 21, and Stevie McMullen, 32, to Manchester Crown Court from Britain's first privately financed prison HMP Altcourse in Merseyside . McMullen was due to appear on conspiracy to rob charges and MacDonald was due to be formally sentenced for unconnected offences of conspiracy to commit robbery. Three men wearing balaclavas smashed a car into the side of the van on a busy road and threatened one of the guards with a sawn-off shotgun after bringing the vehicle to a halt and breaking its windows with axes and sledgehammers. The prison break fugitives, dubbed the 'most wanted men in Britain' while they on the run, were captured within days after a £10,000 reward was offered for information on their whereabouts. Ryan MacDonald, 20, left, and and Stevie . McMullen, 32, right, were both convicted of conspiracy to possess an . imitation firearm at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. Both . pleaded guilty to conspiracy to escape at earlier hearings . McMullen was held following a police swoop on a car on the A6 near Lancaster and McDonald was nabbed at a house in Ordsall, Greater Manchester. A gang of men and women were later convicted over the daring escape. Taylor, 25, is now being held at a prison near Madrid after an extradition hearing in the Spanish capital. He is expected to be flown back to Britain in the next few days. The two unnamed Brits with him have been bailed after being arrested on suspicion of using a stolen car and motorbike. They now face trial in Spain. The arrests were carried out by Spain's National Police Fugitives Unit, led by Olga Lizana, which last year tracked down and detained 40 British criminals and suspects. Taylor was detained in Benidorm, Costa Blanca . Detective Inspector Lizana, who keeps a 28in machete in her office which she confiscated from fugitive armed robber Andrew Moran after arresting him at his Costa Blanca home last May, has warned British criminals hiding out in Spain she is on their tail. She said recently: 'We will be spoiling their holidays in Spain very soon.' A spokesman for Spain's National Police, identifying the arrested Brit trio only by their initials, said today: 'Spanish National Police officers have arrested in Benidorm a fugitive wanted by the UK for crimes including assisting the escape of prisoners and unlawful possession of a weapon. 'He was located in a cafe in Benidorm together with two other individuals who have also been arrested for driving a motorbike and car stolen in the United Kingdom. 'The arrested fugitive, aided by two armed men, helped two prisoners to escape from a van which was taking them from HMP Altcourse to Manchester Crown Court.' Nearly £4,000 in cash and four mobiles phones were seized from the British trio. Security was stepped up at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, today, pictured, amid fears the duo may plan another escape during their trial .

"By . Gerard Couzens . A British graduate died ‘from a nosebleed’ after he was attacked outside a nightclub in Ibiza and a ‘negligent’ doctor failed to treat him properly, a court heard yesterday. William Hall, 22, suffered fatal haemorrhaging the day after being seen by a specialist who sent him after failing to find the source of the blood, the court was told. Ear, nose and throat expert Juan Mari ‘did not seem interested’ when he examined him in A&E at Ibiza’s main hospital two days after the nightclub attack, the former public schoolboy’s mother told a judge. William Hall, 22, on holiday in Ibiza, Spain in August 2006. He died 'from a nosebleed' after he was attacked outside a nightclub in Ibiza and a 'negligent' doctor failed to treat him properly, a court heard yesterday . His mother Anna Hall (pictured with her husband) told the one-day manslaughter trial at Ibiza's Criminal Court: 'William was very pale and I got the impression the other ladies who were in the room who I think were nurses would rather he was staying' Anna Hall told the one-day manslaughter trial at Ibiza’s Criminal Court: ‘William was very pale and I got the impression the other ladies who were in the room who I think were nurses would rather he was staying.’ Dr Mari, 55, who still works at the hospital, was one of two defendants at the hearing although he was tried only by a criminal prosecutor hired by William’s family. Ruben Garcia, a 37-year-old drug addict accused of beating up the biology graduate outside Ibiza’s famous DC10 nightclub on August 26 2006, was also tried for manslaughter by a state lawyer as well as the lawyer acting for the dead man’s family. William was on a family holiday with brother George, now 28, mother Anna, 61, and property developer father Richard, 62. Mrs Hall, from Staplegrove near Taunton, Somerset, fought back tears as she told the hearing: ‘William and George were trying to get a taxi to come back to our holiday apartment after their night out. ‘William said he was told by someone milling round the car park that one parked car was a taxi and to get in the back. ‘He was sat in the back waiting to go when a guy got in and started beating him round the head. It was totally unprovoked.’ The graduate, who was planning to start a masters’ degree, was told he had a broken nose when he went to hospital with his mother two days later after suffering an on-off nose bleed and vomiting blood. Ruben Garcia, a 37-year-old drug addict accused of beating up the biology graduate outside Ibiza's famous DC10 nightclub on August 26 2006, was also tried for manslaughter by a state lawyer as well as the lawyer acting for the dead man's family . Duty A&E doctor Maria Belen Fernandez told the court specialist Juan Mari agreed to come to the hospital after William suffered two nose bleeds and tests showed his haemoglobin level had dropped to 10.4, well below the normal reading for a man his age, and which should have been around 14. But he was sent home after having his nose packed by Dr Mari during a 15-minute examination - despite experts insisting at a September 2007 inquest into William’s death in the UK  that the blood tests results were ‘red light’ warnings of heavy blood loss. He died from an upper airway haemorrhage the following day after collapsing at his holiday apartment and being rushed back to the same hospital. Juan Ginard, prosecuting for the family, criticised Dr Mari for failing to ‘follow protocol’ by discharging William without detecting the source of the bleed and said the hospital should have done more blood tests before sending him home. He told the court post-mortem results showed the Brit holidaymaker was haemorrhaging blood behind his nose but the treatment he was given was for a bleed to his front nasal cavity. ‘William Hall died from a simple nose bleed,’ he said. Doctor Juan Mari sent William home after having his nose packed by Dr Mari during a 15-minute examination - despite experts insisting at a September 2007 inquest into William's death in the UK  that the blood tests results were 'red light' warnings of heavy blood loss . ‘It beggars belief that in this day and age someone so young should die as a result of a something like that, of a drip by drip bleed over nearly three days, eight hours of which he was in Can Misses [hospital] under the supervision of a duty doctor and more specifically Juan Mari.’ Enrique Kupman, a doctor the lawyer called as a witness, added: ‘Packing the front of the nose when the problem is a leak behind the nose is like putting a bandage on your right hand when it’s your left hand that’s bleeding. ‘If I hadn’t detected the source of the bleed, I would have been more prudent and kept the patient in observation overnight rather than sending him home. ‘The root problem wasn’t attacked sufficiently, the tap was left open and the tragic outcome was William Hall’s death.’ William died from an upper airway haemorrhage the following day after collapsing at his holiday apartment and being rushed back to the same hospital . Dr Mari, under cross-examination and during a last address to the court before the end of the trial, insisted he had followed protocol at all times. He said: ‘My actions were correct. The action I took that day was the action I have continued to take every time I see someone with a nose bleed.’ Ear, nose and throat doctor Manuel Tomas Barberan, a defence witness specialising in hospital protocols for nose bleeds, added: ‘I wouldn’t have acted any differently that day and nor would 20 other specialists in the same situation. ‘Dr Mari followed protocol.’ Garcia, who confessed during today’s hearing he was addicted to heroin, admitted assaulting William but insisted he slapped him once only with an open hand and said the Brit walked away without any blood on his face. He was arrested nearly a fortnight later after being identified by a nightclub security guard who saw him treating his swollen right hand with ice the night of the assault. State prosecutor Isabel Beneyto told the court: ‘The origin of Mr Hall’s death was the facial trauma he suffered during the assault by the defendant.’ Dr Mari and Garcia, who both pleaded innocent, face up to three years in jail each if convicted. Judge Clara Ramirez de Arellano deferred her verdict. She is expected to deliver it in writing in around a fortnight’s time. William’s father said after the hearing: ‘We would like to see Dr Mari especially convicted which is why we brought this prosecution against him. ‘Experts in the UK have said the blood tests performed at the Spanish hospital should have alerted them to the seriousness of my son’s situation.’ His wife Anna: ‘William was such a lovely boy. I’m sure he would have been alive today if he had got the proper treatment.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","William Hall, 22, suffered fatal haemorrhaging in 2006 while on holiday .

Katharina Katit-Staheli, 40, fled her home in Switzerland with son Dylan, who suffered from hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain, but had been captured by Police in Spain . Officers had taken her to hospital where it is believed she managed to get hold of a knife which she used to stab the child. Katharina Katit-Staheli, 40, stabbed her son Dylan to death after losing a custody battle and going on the run . The horrific incident happened . just hours after the pair had been tracked down to the town of . Torrevieja near Alicante by officers searching for them with an . international arrest warrant. Spanish police had put out a public appeal for information on their whereabouts just 48 hours earlier  after the child's father reported them missing. Guardia Civil officers took him to hospital after discovering them in a shopping centre in Torrevieja around 7pm yesterday/on Wednesday. Dylan was attacked just before midnight at the town hospital. An early report said he had been smothered before the mother - who no longer had legal custody of the child - was stopped as she slashed her throat with the same knife. But a police source today confirmed the child had been stabbed to death - although he said a judicial secrecy order prevented him from giving out more details. It was not immediately clear if the woman was under police guard when the incident occurred or if a police officer was keeping watch on the room mum and son were in. The police source, who asked not to be named, said: 'I can confirm the child we were searching for has been killed in hospital and his mother - who is the sole suspect - subsequently tried to commit suicide. 'The child was stabbed to death. There's obviously going to be an investigation now into what happened because she had only been tracked down and arrested hours earlier following an international appeal.' Police in Zurich had offered a reward of £2080 for information on Katharina and Dylan's whereabouts. They were last seen on December 24 and are believed to have left Switzerland in a black Jeep Gran Cherokee. A court spokesman said: 'A judge is investigating the circumstances surrounding the violent death of a 10-month-old baby discovered in Torrevieja with its mother who was the subject of an international arrest warrant.

A man accused of stabbing three Brits outside a Spanish bar during Halloween celebrations is a violent burglar who got a prison officer pregnant while he was in jail in the UK, it has emerged. Kelly-Anne McDade gave birth to Nelson Delgado’s child after secret trysts in his cell at a young offenders institution in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The Portuguese immigrant was serving an indeterminate sentence for aggravated burglary and assault after attacking a couple in their own home. Nelson Delgado, 21, a prisoner who got prison officer Kelly-Anne McDade pregnant . Kelly-Anne McDade, 31, a former prison officer, who had a child with prisoner Nelson Delgado . Crime scene: Police believe Delgado mistook his alleged victims for a gang of partygoers wearing Halloween fancy dress who had assaulted his brother hours earlier . McDade, 31, when their child was born . in February 2009, had to resign after she was caught on CCTV opening . Delgado’s prison door following a night-time lockdown in August 2008. She was jailed for 30 months at Aylesbury Crown Court in November 2009. Delgado, . who grew up in Britain, moved to Majorca to do bar work after being . released from jail and started dating a British girl he met on the . island. Last night Delgado, . now 25, was back behind bars after being held on suspicion of attempted . murder and assault over the vicious assault in the party resort of . Magaluf in the early hours of Friday morning. Four . people including three Brits were stabbed near the Red Lion pub in an . attack police suspect was linked to a glassing in a nearby bar moments . earlier. Delgado had just finished his first summer season in Majorca as a public relations worker for local bars. Suspect: Nelson Delgado, 25, from Portugal, was held by police after a knifeman went on the rampage outside a club in the party resort of Magaluf . He is believed to have moved to the island straight after his release from prison in Britain. Alleged stabbing victim, nightclub . manager Daniel Billingham, 34, is still in hospital receiving treatment . for two stab wounds to his back. His condition today was described as 'stable'. His friend Sam Byrne, 30, was released from hospital after being treated for stab wounds to his stomach and arms. Another British man and a Spaniard, who both live locally, are also out of hospital after receiving treatment for knife wounds. Mr Billingham, speaking today about the attack, said: 'I think I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'The attacker came looking for the . person he blamed for hurting his brother earlier in a separate incident . and picked on someone who had nothing to do with it. 'It’s all a bit hazy to be quite honest. 'All I remember is him asking me to step out into the street and then being attacked.

Saturday after appearing before a judge investigating him on suspicion . of attempted murder and assault. He has not yet been charged with any . crime, as is customary in Spain where suspects are only officially . accused of crimes just before trial.

Brother Fabio is thought to have left Spain to return to Britain following the weekend incident. Delgado was locked up in in 2007 for breaking into a couple’s home with a friend armed with a four-inch knife. A judge at Bournemouth Crown Court . branded him ‘dangerous’ after it emerged he punched his male victim and . hit the woman over the head with a beer bottle before asking her if she . had ever been raped. The terrified woman told him she had the Aids virus in case he tried to force himself on her. He admitted two charges of aggravated burglary, actual bodily harm and grevious bodily harm. McDade had been working at Aylesbury . Young Offenders Institution for three years when she started her sexual . relationship with Delgado in 2008. She told colleagues she had become pregnant after a holiday relationship. When her home was searched after her . arrest, police found a mobile phone with a message from Delgado which . read, ‘I love you my wife.’ She carried on visiting him before she . was jailed and reports at the time said they were planning to set up . home together after they were both freed so they could bring up their . son together.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Pope Francis has agreed to meet his first Falklands War veteran since his election last March. He will receive fellow Argentinian Oscar Doria Fernandez privately at his Vatican home Saint Martha's House on Wednesday. Fernandez, the youngest Argentinian Air Force non-comissioned officer to take part in the 1982 conflict, wants the Pope to bless two crosses due to end up at Falklands cemeteries where casualties from the two countries are buried. Pope Francis (right) will meet fellow Argentinian Oscar Doria Fernandez (left) privately at his Vatican home . Speaking before leaving his home in Gran Canaria ahead of his meeting with the Pope, Fernandez, 19 when war broke out the two countries, said: 'I want to tell the Pope there are new paths we haven't trodden and that we have to take, and that I'm committed to helping. 'I believe the Falklands issue can be solved but we have wounds to heal because the damage has been great.' Pope Francis, the first Argentinian Pontiff, claimed the islands were snatched by Britain when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 2011. He insisted those who died in the war had 'shed their blood on Argentinian soil.' And in a mass to mark the 30th anniversary of the Argentinian invasion he said the islands were 'usurped.' After he became Pope, David Cameron urged him to respect the overwhelming wishes of residents who days earlier had voted overwhelming to remain British in a referendum. In a dig at the Vatican, where officials pumped white smoke from a chimney to announce Pope Francis had been chosen in keeping with tradition, he said: 'The white smoke over the Falklands was pretty clear.' Pope Francis poses with Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner during a private meeting at Domus Sanctae Marthae in Vatican city . Argentinian president Christina Kirchner begged her compatriot to intervene in the row with Britain over sovereignty of the islands when they lunched together before his inaugural papal mass. But Tory minister Baroness Warsi, the minister for faith, said later she was confident the Pope would not get involved. And Nigel Baker, the UK ambassador to the Holy see, claimed around the same time he had received assurances from Vatican officials its policy of non-intervention in the dispute had not changed. Fernandez, who has written a book about the Falklands war and is in close contact with British veterans of the conflict, says he was invited to meet the Pope through his publishers. He said ahead of his meeting with Pope Francis he supported the idea of a 'diplomatic war' and dialogue.","Pope will meet Argentinian Oscar Doria Fernandez privately at his Vatican home on Wednesday .

A Portuguese man has been accused of stabbing three Britons and a Spaniard in a Spanish holiday resort after a fight in a nightclub turned into a mass street brawl. Nelson Delgado, 25, from Portugal, was held by police after a knifeman went on the rampage outside a pub in the party resort of Magaluf. He has been remanded in custody after appearing in court. Two of the injured Brits remained in a serious condition in hospital today with stab wounds to their back and abdomen. They are currently in the island's Son Espase and Son Llatzer hospitals. The stabbing happened around 4am on Friday morning, and more than 20 Britons working in the resort were said to have been involved in the brawl. Police believe he mistook his alleged victims for a gang of partygoers wearing Halloween fancy dress who had assaulted his brother hours earlier. Delgado, thought to have grown up in Britain, kept his head bowed as he was led into court by police for a private hearing on Saturday where he was told he was being probed on suspicion of attempted murder. He has not yet been charged with any crime. Magaluf is one of Europe's most popular holiday destination for young Britons, but has been tainted with tragedy in recent years.

Tom, an aspiring model and musician from Uxbridge, west London, was said to have ignored a warning from a maintenance man who told him to get down from the outside fire escape of the four-star hotel. He then slipped and fell more than 60ft, landing on a wall. Staff said they had seen him running away from someone shortly before the tragedy. His father John, 49, said: 'If there was foul play we want to know about it. We owe it to Tom. Whether he was chased is crucial to knowing what happened. 'If something happened and made him panic and try to get away - could someone have potentially met Tom  at the top of the roof or the stairs.?'

"By . Gerard Couzens . The model accused of killing a British millionaire in Spain had been extradited to face questioning over the alleged murder. Mayka Kukucova, the ex-girlfriend of victim Andy Bush, was flown to Madrid yesterday after authorities in her native Slovakia handed her over to Spanish police. Investigators in the Costa del Sol - where Mr Bush, 48, was shot dead at his mansion in Estepona last month - hope to question the suspect over the weekend. Scroll down for video . Questioning: Mayka Kukucova, left, is being interrogated over the death of ex-boyfriend Andy Bush, right . Extradited: The model has been transported from her native Slovakia to Madrid for questioning . After being interrogated by murder police Kukucova, 24, will be handed over to an investigating judge who will decide whether to remand her in custody or release her on bail. She handed herself in to police in Slovakia following an international manhunt for her in the wake of Mr Bush's death on April 5. Kukucova spent around six weeks in custody before yesterday's decision to extradite her. She was flown from the Slovak capital Bratislava to Vienna early yesterday morning, and was expected to arrive in Madrid in mid-afternoon. She will be escorted to the nearest police station on arrival in Madrid to be fingerprinted, and will then either be taken for questioning in Estepona or held in Madrid before travelling to the Costa del Sol next week. Arrest: Kukucova pictured after she handed herself in to the authorities in Slovakia . Suspect: The 24-year-old is accused of shooting Mr Bush dead during a row at his Costa del Sol villa . Mr Bush's current girlfriend, Maria Korotaeva, has told Spanish detectives Kukucova was waiting inside his rented villa and opened the door to them after they flew to the Costa del Sol to celebrate their five-month anniversary together. The 21-year-old student at the University of the West of England said she heard shots and a row after leaving the ex-lovers inside the house to argue - and saw his ex flee moments later with the keys to his 4x4 which was later found abandoned nearby. She found his body on the living room floor after firefighters forced their way in following her desperate emergency call. Investigators say Mr Bush was shot twice with an Italian-made .38 special revolver. Couple: At the time of his death, Mr Bush had started a relationship with student Maria Korotaeva . Witness: Miss Korotaeva said she left the room shortly before Mr Bush was shot dead in April . Claims: Mr Bush's new girlfriend said that his ex was madly jealous and described her as a 'snake' Russian-born Miss Korotaeva has described Kukucova as being madly jealous, and said her boyfriend had to change all the locks at his house in Bristol after splitting with her last year. She claimed in an interview shortly after the killing: 'Andy hated her with a passion. She was like a poisonous snake.' Kukucova, who has not yet been charged with any crime, is expected to claim that she shot Mr Bush in self-defence during an argument. Her lawyer in Slovakia said yesterday: 'I haven't been officially informed about her extradition yet by anybody. 'Due to this situation I cannot provide you with any details of the handover. Taken away: Kukucova being apprehended by Slovakian police before her extradition to Spain . Grief: Relatives of Mr Bush pictured at the site of his killing in Estepona, on the Costa del Sol . 'She will be represented by one of my colleagues who is recognised as one of the best criminal lawyers in Spain.' However, sources close to the case in Spain confirmed she had been extradited. Mr Bush's body is still in Spain and a judge has refused his family permission to repatriate it to Britain. Relatives and friends have launched an online petition against the decision.","Mayka Kukucova, 24, allegedly shot Andy Bush dead at Estepona home .

"By . Charlotte Griffiths . Opera star Katherine Jenkins has revealed she is ‘thrilled and surprised’ after accepting a proposal from her boyfriend Andrew Levitas. The romance came to light only last month when Mr Levitas joined her as she collected her OBE from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. The news drew attention as it was believed Miss Jenkins was still in a relationship with Prince ­Harry’s close friend Adam Bidwell, who is known as Bidders. Thrilled: Katherine Jenkins is to marry boyfriend Andrew Levitas, left after he proposed several days ago . In fact, she has been secretly dating Mr Levitas since October, and on Thursday she announced the engagement on her Facebook page. Friends of the 33-year-old mezzo-soprano say she accepted the proposal several days ago but waited before disclosing the news because she was concerned that her wider circle of friends would worry she was rushing into the marriage. The romance came to light only last month when Mr Levitas joined Miss Jenkins as she collected her OBE . But those closest to the Welsh star know she has been ‘head over heels’ in love with Mr Levitas for more than six months after meeting him in New York. Mr Levitas, 36, is a professor at the prestigious New York University and is a distinguished artist and film-maker. Later this year he will be releasing the film Lullaby, which he wrote and directed. It stars Amy Adams, Jennifer Hudson and former Downton Abbey actress Jessica Brown Findlay. Friends say the couple plan to marry in 2015 and are likely to have the ceremony in Wales, where Miss Jenkins’s family lives, followed by a small service in America, where Mr Levitas was born. A source close to the couple told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Katherine has been preparing the announcement for a while. She is very excited – she loves how artistic and intelligent Andrew is. ‘He is considering moving to the UK for her.’ Another friend said: ‘She has definitely left her party ways behind her since meeting Andrew, and that means some of her socialite friends have been left feeling as if they have been discarded. This relationship is moving very fast – they are so in love. I wouldn’t be surprised if she is expecting by this time next year.’ Miss Jenkins was previously engaged to former Blue Peter presenter Gethin Jones, who proposed in 2011. But the ­couple split later that year, and shortly afterwards the singer left the UK to pursue fame in America. She now spends much of her time in New York with Mr Levitas.

"By . Charlotte Griffiths . He famously claimed that making art is like robbing a bank. If so, Damien Hirst could now be considered the Robin Hood of the art world after donating one of his  most audacious – and expensive – pieces to charity. His latest ambitious creation, a 10,000-year-old woolly mammoth skeleton, gilded in 24-carat gold leaf and encased in a giant gold-framed tank, has been sold for an eye-watering £8.9 million. Entitled Gone But Not Forgotten,  it was auctioned at a star-studded event and bought by Leonard  Blavatnik, the Ukrainian-born owner of Warner Music and Britain’s fourth richest person. Scroll down for video . Damien Hirst's latest ambitious creation, a 10,000-year-old woolly mammoth skeleton, gilded in 24-carat gold leaf and encased in a giant gold-framed tank, has been sold for an eye-watering £8.9m . The businessman conceded that he ‘doesn’t yet’ know what to do with the 10ft-tall work. But it could look good in his £200 million, 13-bedroom home in Kensington, West London. Mr Blavatnik, whose fortune has been put at £10 billion, certainly becomes one of the few people in the world who privately owns such an important piece of natural history. Mr Hirst – the world’s richest artist with a wealth of more than £200 million – bought the skeleton last year, but is sworn to secrecy about which collector he acquired it from. It took the artist and several members of his team weeks to painstakingly take apart every bone from the skeleton. One guest who beamed with pride when the gavel came down was model Katie Keight, a 24-year-old budding actress who has been  quietly seeing Mr Hirst for months (both pictured) They were then delicately painted with thousands of pieces of paper-thin gold with feather-light brushes at his studio, Science Ltd, in Stroud, Gloucestershire, before the skeleton was reassembled. The finished work went under the hammer on Friday at a Pirelli-sponsored fundraiser for the amfAR  charity in Cannes, attended by Leonardo DiCaprio, Kylie Minogue, Dita Von Teese, Adrien Brody, Paris Hilton and Catherine Deneuve. Other lots included a trip to space with DiCaprio on board the Virgin Galactic, which fetched £567,000, and an Andy Warhol print of Marilyn Monroe which sold for £283,000. The audience were laughing for most of the night but nothing was funny when it came to money. Sharon Stone, who acted as auctioneer for some of the lots, had to be corrected dozens of times for calling out ‘dollars’ instead of euros. Mr Hirst - the world's richest artist with a wealth of more than £200million - bought the skeleton last year, but is sworn to secrecy about which collector he acquired it from . Organisers had to grab the microphone when Simon de Pury – the world’s best-known art auctioneer – made the same mistake during the bidding war for the mammoth. For the sale of Hirst’s skeleton, the room fell silent. Hirst himself was said to be too nervous to take his place at the top table, and Mr De Pury told the audience: ‘Mr Hirst is very elusive, I can’t see him. But he is believed to be somewhere in this room.’ A guest told The Mail on Sunday: ‘He wasn’t trying to pull a Banksy with his absence, he was just too modest. He was worried the piece would sell for less than it was worth so he hid. Luckily for Damien his fears were unsubstantiated.’ One guest who beamed with pride when the gavel came down was model Katie Keight, a 24-year-old budding actress who has been  quietly seeing Mr Hirst for months after meeting him through movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who  is convinced she will be his next  big star. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have known Damien for a few months. We are a bit cuddly and a bit snuggly and snoggy but that’s it.’ The golden mammoth was the only animal skeleton in Hirst’s natural history collection, which he began in 1991 and includes various animals immersed in formaldehyde. His famous The Golden Calf sold for £10.3 million in 2008.","Entitled Gone But Not Forgotten, it was .

"By . Nadine Dorries . Dorries: 'Boris is the silver bullet who will give the Tories a majority' I wrote in this newspaper back in February that David Cameron should deploy the Tory Party secret weapon and invite Boris back into the Westminster fold. Now that has happened. With Boris batting for the team, we have a much stronger chance of winning the next General Election. Boris is our perfect anti-Nigel Farage weapon. Following his strongly Eurosceptic speech last week, Boris will undoubtedly coax back the voters who have temporarily left the Conservatives and dallied with Ukip. If anyone could be the silver bullet needed to take us clear across the majority line, the Mayor of London is it. A victory for Cameron and George Osborne removes any leadership vacancy. However, Boris may have a further opportunity. In 2017, Cameron has pledged a referendum on Europe following renegotiation talks. It is well known that he will campaign for a Yes vote to stay in. Following his speech last week, it is very possible Boris will campaign for a No vote. If he does and the No vote wins, the pressure will be on Cameron to resign. The question then will be which candidates MPs put forward to the party membership to elect as leader. For the past 20 years, Osborne has carefully plotted his rise through the ranks. During reshuffles, he placed his acolytes in key positions. He has located his unofficial cheerleader for his campaign as future leader, Michael Gove, in the seat of Chief Whip. This means he has the controller of backbench opinion in his pocket. Six months ago, Gove attended a private dinner with Rupert Murdoch. During the evening, he verbally disparaged both Boris and Theresa May and condemned them both as potential leaders. Osborne is anxious that none of Murdoch’s newspaper titles support Boris. Gove is nothing if not a loyal servant to the present leadership, therefore it can only be assumed the comments were made not only with prior approval, but were planned. But it is inconceivable that Boris would not be one of the final two choices for next leader. However, he has a great deal of work to do first. Whereas Boris may have deployed a light touch on immigration as London Mayor, his message will need to alter dramatically to convince MPs. They will want to hear him say a Thatcherite ‘No, No, No,’ to open borders. Boris needs to remind those MPs of his track record of success. He took an ailing London and has transformed it into a leading metropolis on the global stage. If he can climb that mountain and reassure all MPs, Boris is indeed on course to be our next leader. Supporters of Boris Johnson (left) are said to be privately vowing to force Prime Minister David Cameron (right) to quit if he tries to form a second Coalition with the Lib Dems, it has emerged . But what of Osborne? He will already be aware that a continuity candidate, in the form of himself or May, will not be acceptable to MPs or the party membership. The choice will be between Boris and a member of the 2010 intake. My guess is that Osborne will already be negotiating with such an MP and helping to position them as a potential leadership candidate. The deal being that Osborne will persuade his people, the MPs he has rewarded and groomed over years, to support that candidate. It won’t work. There is no MP in any party with the combination of talent and achievement that can rival the Boris stardust. Unfortunately for Osborne, he is already yesterday’s man.","'With Boris batting for the team, we have much stronger chance at election'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Former Tasmanian premier Paul Lennon claims he was kicked out of Melbourne's Crown Casino last Thursday, for 'licking his finger' during a poker game. Victorian Police confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that a '58-year-old Tasmanian man was issued with a penalty notice for failing to leave a licensed premises' on Whiteman Street. The incident, which saw Mr Lennon allegedly fined $738, occurred on Thursday July 24 at 11:30pm. Former Tasmanian premier Paul Lennon was kicked out of Melbourne's Crown Casino last Thursday and fined $738 by police . A witness reported that Mr Lennon began verbally abusing a woman whom he claimed had touched his chips. After refusing requests from security to calm down, the witness described how the former premiere was dragged out of the venue by approximately six security guards after having cable ties put around his wrists. While being wrestled out of the venue, the witness said that Mr Lennon said, 'Don't you know who I am?' to the guards. A witness said that the 58-year-old was forced out by up to six security guards after verbally abusing a woman who he claimed had touched his chips . Mr Lennon denied he was abusive and claimed that he was removed after a female dealer became offended by him licking his index finger before he picked up his cards during a $2 game. 'At one instance I licked my index finger before touching my dealt cards, as you sometimes do,' he said in a statement, according to the ABC. 'But apparently this is against the rules - something I was not aware of. Mr Lennon denied the comments, saying he was asked to leave after he offended a female dealer by licking his index finger before picking up his cards . 'For this I was removed. I questioned the reason why, but was not given an answer.' Mr Lennon, who believed he did nothing wrong, said that he requested for the police to be called. He said he was manhandled by the members of security and that he only had water to drink at the venue.","Former Tasmanian premier Paul Lennon was fined $738 by police after being kicked out of Melbourne's Crown Casino .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Being breastfed as a baby might be better than statins in staving off heart disease in later life, according to new research. Babies given mother’s milk for three months or more have a much lower risk of the chronic inflammation that can also lead to diabetes and other metabolic illnesses, US researchers say. Suckling lowers the amounts of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood that is linked to clogged arteries and damage to blood vessels. Breastfeeding: Babies given mother¿s milk for three months or more have a much lower risk of the chronic inflammation that can also lead to diabetes and other metabolic illnesses, US researchers say (file picture) Professor Molly Metzger, of Washington University, said: ‘We are looking at the effects of these early factors on later levels of CRP, a biomarker associated with risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. ‘Comparing the long-term effects of breastfeeding to the effects of clinical trials of statin therapy, we find breastfeeding to exert effects that are as large or larger.’ Her findings – published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences – indicate breastfeeding has implications for children’s health decades later, she said. The researchers used data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, including parent surveys, and blood samples providing measurements of CRP. Tablets: Statins - currently prescribed to 7million Britons - can lower CRP levels as well as cutting cholesterol . The findings held up in a series of sibling models – in which one was breastfed and the other not – which allow for genetic factors for elevated CRP. 'Comparing the long-term effects of breastfeeding to the effects of clinical trials of statin therapy, we find breastfeeding to exert effects that are as large or larger' Professor Molly Metzger, Washington University . Professor Metzger added: ‘These findings underscore the importance of a preventive approach, including but not limited to prenatal health care and breastfeeding.’ It has been suggested that high CRP levels could be an indicator of cardiovascular disease risk, even in someone who does not have high cholesterol levels – the prime cause of clogged arteries. CRP, an inflammatory marker associated with the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries, is also a contributory factor. Statins – currently prescribed to about 7million Britons – can lower CRP levels as well as cutting cholesterol.","Breastfeeding 'has implications for children's health decades later'

"By . Stephanie Linning . Seizure: Maggie O'Connor, 26, was walking her dog Dillion when she had the fit. She said the men were laughing at her because she had wet herself . An epileptic woman who suffered a severe fit woke up to find two strangers laughing at her and filming the ordeal on their mobile phones. Maggie O’Connor, 26, was walking her dog in the grounds of St Botolph's Priory in Colchester, Essex, when she had a fit. She woke up to find two men standing over her filming her as they laughed about how she had wet herself during the seizure. Miss O'Connor explained that she was covered in blood after having bitten her tongue and had also wet herself - both of which are common occurrences for some sufferers of epilepsy during a fit. One of the men, who Miss O'Connor described as being in their 20s, put a mobile phone inches from her face in order to get a close-up, she said. He only stopped filming when her Staffordshire bull terrier Dillion growled protectively. Miss O'Connor, who has had epilepsy since she was 16, wrote about her shocking experience on Facebook in a bid to 'find the boys'. The post has been shared more than 3,000 times but the pair have not been traced. Essex Police have said they won't investigate the incident because a criminal offence has not taken place. Miss O'Connor said: 'With a seizure, you can wet yourself and bite your tongue and these were the two facts that they seemed to find most hilarious as I had wet myself and I had blood down my front. 'They continued filming whilst I was awake and conscious but because I had had the seizure I was in a really vulnerable position. 'There was nothing I could do - my legs were too jelly to move and I could not string a proper sentence together so I just had to sit there whilst they tried to humiliate me by videoing me. 'Even though I had woken up, they only stopped filming because Dillion started growling. One even took the time to do a close up of my face. The last thing I heard as they ran away was “she f**king pissed herself, ha"".' She added: 'How would they have felt if it was their sister or mum it had happened to?' Miss O'Connor was also angered because a number of other people ignored what was happening. She said: 'There were plenty of people in the park and no-one stepped which makes me cross.' Morning walk: Miss O'Connor was walking in the grounds of St Botolph's Priory in Colchester, Essex, when she had a fit. She said she was 'cross' as there were other people who saw what was happening and did nothing . She added that she found it bizarre that no offence had been committed. She said: 'It's . shocking in a sense that no offence has been committed but I was in a . public area so people can film what they want - it's morally wrong though.' The 26-year-old suffers seizures approximately every two weeks and is left almost completely incapacitated for about four to five minutes. The number of fits Miss O'Connor, a hairdresser, suffers has increased in the past year and has left her unable to work. She is now hoping to raise awareness about epilepsy following her ordeal and hopes that other people will be more understanding when they see sufferers having a fit. Stacey Rennard, from charity Epilepsy Action, said about 600,000 people in the UK had epilepsy. She said that there are about 40 different kinds of seizures and 'some are easier to recognise than others'. Ms Rennard said: 'In Maggie’s case, it was very upsetting to hear she was in a vulnerable position and sustained an injury and still people didn’t stop and help her.' She said the charity hears about a wide variety of experiences and that some are bad 'like in this horrible case'. She added: 'We do hear from people who’ve come across the good Samaritans who’ve sat and waited with them while they recover.' An Essex Police spokeswoman said: 'No criminal offence has been committed.'","Maggie O'Connor was walking her dog in St Botolph's Priory in Colchester .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A millionaire Tory donor missed out on the top job at Ofsted yesterday, putting an end to a simmering Coalition row. David Ross, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, had been backed by Michael Gove when he was Education Secretary. But his successor Nicky Morgan has announced that David Hoare will become chairman of the schools watchdog in September. Millionaire Tory donor: David Ross (left), co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, had been backed by Michael Gove (right) when he was Education Secretary . The appointment of the businessman, a trustee of the UK’s largest chain of academy schools, is far less controversial. Last night the move was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats, who said they hoped it was a sign that calm was being restored to the Department for Education. Mrs Morgan said Mr Hoare ‘has the expertise in leadership and governance crucial to helping Ofsted through a significant period of change and reform’. New job: David Hoare will become chairman of the schools watchdog in September . She added: ‘He is also passionate about education and his work with academies across the country shows he shares my commitment to ever higher standards.’ Mr Hoare, current chairman of mail company DX Group, has worked with the Academies Enterprise Trust, which runs around 70 state-funded schools. He said he was looking forward to working closely with the Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, to raise standards - particularly for disadvantaged pupils. ‘Ofsted has a key role helping to improve the leadership of our schools and the performance of our pupils. I look forward to being part of the team,’ Mr Hoare added. The move comes after a bitter battle within the Coalition - with accusations by the Liberal Democrats that former education secretary Michael Gove was trying to politicise the job. Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws was said to have been furious when Mr Gove announced in February that current Ofsted chair Baroness Morgan - a former senior aide to Tony Blair - would not have her contract extended. The Lib Dems were further enraged by reports that Mr Gove was lining up Mr Ross to take over the position. However Mr Gove's demotion to Chief Whip in David Cameron's reshuffle earlier this month and his replacement by Mrs Morgan appears to have cleared the way for the dispute to be settled. Mr Hoare has been chairman of a number of companies including Virgin Express, Paragon Group and Laura Ashley and is chairman of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

"By . Andrew Gimson . Boris Johnson does not want to be Wayne Rooney, a star player who carries out someone else’s plan. He intends to be Louis van Gaal, the star manager who arrives on a mission to take the team back to the top of the league. But the Conservatives already have a manager. He is called David Cameron, and he has been running the side since 2005. Last week he sent a tweet from his holiday deckchair: ‘Great news that Boris plans to stand at next year’s General Election – I’ve always said I want my star players on the pitch.’ Cameron is making the best of what both for him and his party is an extremely dangerous situation. The Conservatives are in a concealed state of mutiny. Many backbenchers think Cameron is a hopeless leader, and would like nothing better than to get rid of him and his henchman, George Osborne. Scroll down for video . London mayor Boris Johnson pictured delivering a speech on Europe at Bloomberg HQ in London this week . A spontaneous uprising would be unlikely to succeed. The mutiny requires a leader. This is the significance of the return of Boris: he is coming aboard as the man with the dash, the subversiveness and the acute sense of timing needed to overthrow Cameron. Boris also has a growing band of sympathisers who could coalesce into something really formidable. The reshuffle confirmed to a large number of Tory MPs that they have nothing to hope for from the present leadership. I cannot break confidences. So let me just say how moving I found it, a day or two before the reshuffle took place, to be told by a Tory MP of his outstanding suitability for the post of Minister of State for Paperclips. Alas, the paperclips job went to a woman who always does what Osborne tells her. Paperclip (as I have decided to call the MP in order to preserve his anonymity) got on the blower to Boris. And what a sympathetic hearing he received from the Mayor of London. I am happy to report that Paperclip has gone off on holiday with a spring in his step. For he is under the impression that Boris has every intention of offering him a job commensurate with his talents, as soon as the present ministerial team can be got rid of. Boris’s enemies go around asking whether he can be trusted. It is a good question, but it also betrays a failure to understand what is going on. For in order to lead a successful uprising, you need in some respects to be untrustworthy. Boris by temperament is an outsider, a maverick. He cannot see a red button marked ‘Danger – Do Not Press’ without wanting to press it. Cameron would rather see politics as a game of football in which everyone is obliged to obey the rules. But Tory politics over the next year or two may turn out to be more like Mutiny On The Bounty, with Cameron as Captain Bligh and Boris as Fletcher Christian, the leader of the mutineers. Boris Johnson (pictured with David Cameron) intends to stand as a Conservative MP at the next election . The time may not be far off when Cameron, Osborne and their followers are lowered over the side into an open boat, while Boris takes command of the ship. But the time for this parting of the ways has not yet come. Cameron and Osborne have the chance to achieve in 2015 the victory which eluded them in 2010. Any Conservative who disrupts the General Election campaign will not be forgiven. Boris has accepted the logic of this. He is going to be the most loyal member of the Conservative campaign one could hope to find. But his loyalty will often be so exaggerated as to amount to a form of subversion. As he said when asked about the General Election in his first newspaper interview after announcing his intention to stand: ‘The big story is going to be Dave.’ Which other leading Conservative dares call the Prime Minister ‘Dave’? And how big a story will Dave be when he tells us for the umpteenth time about the wonders of ‘Our Long-Term Economic Plan?’ Journalists condemned to cover this stuff will instead flock to see Boris, in the hope that he will say something more amusing. The critics will try to suggest that because Boris does not have an ideology, he is somehow unworthy to engage in politics. But ideology can lead to appalling blunders. Boris Johnson does not want to be Wayne Rooney (pictured) - a star player who carries out someone else’s plan. He intends to be Louis van Gaal - the star manager, says Andrew Gimson . What Boris has is a set of powerfully conservative instincts, which he applies in the light of circumstances. I nevertheless believe he is a bit hurt by the claim that he has nothing much to say about policy. Hence his assembly at City Hall of a team who can feed him the ammunition he needs for his leadership bid. People such as Gerard Lyons, who became the Mayor’s chief economic adviser. Lyons supplied the research Boris last week used to place pressure on Cameron to adopt a tougher negotiating position in Europe. But Boris did not himself get bogged down in technicalities. He instead said of this new strategy: ‘If you don’t go in hard to the tackle you are never going to come out well. You’ve got to go in hard and low.’ It is an analogy drawn from rugby, a game which Boris played with enthusiasm at school and university. When the time comes to ‘go in hard and low’ against Cameron, Boris will undoubtedly do so.

The dinner will be held on March 27 and the source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Harry has told Cressida she is welcome to come along.’ If she accepts the invitation – as she is predicted to – it will be a significant moment for Cressida, 25, who began dating Harry in 2012. Although she won’t officially be greeting guests, as the Duchess of Cambridge does when she accompanies Prince William to events, Cressida effectively will be the event’s co-host. The dinner, hosted at St James's Palace, honours friends Prince Harry made on a trek to the South Pole . The source added: ‘Harry and his mates went through thick and thin together, so the dinner party will  be a really relaxed and jovial affair. But there is no doubt that it will be a Royal banquet, albeit a  private one.’ St James’s Palace is often in use for official functions and, with permission from the Queen, can also be used by courtiers for private events such as weddings. The State Apartments are used about 100 times a year for State visits and for hosting receptions for charities, such as the one Harry is hosting. An aide at Clarence House insisted that as the dinner would be private it is not technically termed as an official Royal event. But the aide added: ‘The rooms in St James’s Palace are the Queen’s rooms and are only used for official engagements like receptions and dinners, including for charities.’ Another source said: ‘Because she is Harry’s girlfriend, Cressida’s very presence at a dinner hosted  by him would position her into the role of co-host.’ The couple, pictured at Twickenham for the Six Nations, have been seen at a number of public events . The invitation to accompany Harry at the dinner comes two weeks after they kissed and cuddled in full view of dozens of cameras at the We Day youth event at Wembley Arena. Cressida has also been seen with Harry watching rugby at Twickenham, prompting commentators to note that their relationship has matured to a stage where she now feels at ease being seen with the  fourth-in-line to the throne. Harry, 29, is the patron of the Walking With The Wounded charity, which provides rehabilitation services for military veterans overcoming life-changing injuries. His dedication was proven beyond doubt when he spent weeks in the Antarctic on a gruelling trek with injured servicemen Duncan Slater, Ibrar Ali, Kate Philip, Conrad  Dickinson, Richard Eyre and Guy Disney, who are all invited to  the dinner. It is believed that some of the guests have already met Cressida under less formal circumstances.

"By . Stephanie Linning . Brutal: John Davis, pictured, was binge drinking with friends the night before his vicious attack on his three-week-old son, who was left with cerebral palsy . A father who battered his three-week-old baby boy so badly he was left with cerebral palsy has been jailed for eight years. John Davis, 30, had spent the night before the savage attack binge drinking vodka with two friends to celebrate the birth of his son. The next morning Davis offered to give the baby his morning feed as his mother lay in bed but instead subjected him to an horrific attack at their home in Herne Bay, Kent. The defenceless baby needed his skull reconstructed after suffering severe head injuries, five broken ribs, bleeding to his brain and a broken collarbone. He was rushed to hospital and twice stopped breathing on the way and paramedics had to bring him back to life. A court heard that the child, now 15 months old, was left with life-changing injuries including cerebral palsy. Davis, who has repeatedly refused to say how he inflicted the injuries, initially refused to admit his guilt. As a result the baby’s mother found herself under suspicion and was arrested and not allowed to see her son again until he was eight months old. Davis eventually admitted grievous bodily harm and a jury heard how two years ago he narrowly avoided prison for dangling another child from a balcony. He was jailed for eight years at Canterbury Crown Court. Sentencing Davis last week, Judge Heather Norton said: . 'This was an extremely serious offence. It is difficult for anyone to understand how an adult can cause injuries and treat a tiny vulnerable baby in the way that you did. 'I have received statements and a letter from you which speak of how good you are with children and how people trust you with children. 'How that side of your personality can be reconciled with what you did is very hard to understand. It does seem that there are two sides of you.' The judge added: 'Although having development problems, it is not possible to say what the final outcome will be for the baby. Jailed: John Daivs has repeatedly refused to say how he inflicted the life-changing injuries on his newborn son. He initially refused to admit his guilt and the baby's mother found herself under suspicion as a result . 'But he appears to be moving in the right direction and that is extremely encouraging.' After the case the baby’s mother, who now lives near Canterbury and cannot be named to protect her child’s identity, said: 'In a period of time Davis will be released and he will go back to his life. 'But my baby will be a victim of what he did, not just for a few years, but for the rest of his life.'","John Davis, 30, offered to give three-week-old baby his morning feed .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Family court ruled that Victoria Rogers was to blame for fatal head injuries caused to her 21-month-old daughter Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, both pictured . A mother who was spared criminal charges over inflicting fatal head injuries on her 21-month-old daughter could now face jail for allegedly going on Facebook in breach of reporting restrictions linked to her case. Victoria Rogers was to blame for the death of her daughter Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, who died after suffering severe head injuries, a family court judge ruled. A document released last month detailing the ruling stated that on the balance of probabilities Victoria Rogers lost her self-control and caused catastrophic injuries to her child. But despite the damning judgment the Crown Prosecution Service has refused to press charges because of ‘insufficient evidence’ to prove who was to blame. Miss Rogers is now accused of breaching a reporting restrictions order by putting four posts on the Facebook page 'Justice for Summer Mai'. The existence of the family judge’s ruling at Teesside County Court was first made known last month soon after a coroner concluded at an entirely separate inquest that 21-month-old Summer was 'unlawfully killed'. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to bring criminal proceedings, which require a higher standard of proof than civil proceedings. The CPS said it could not be established whether it was Summer’s mother, stepfather or grandmother who was looking after her at the time she was injured in February 2012. Today Kirklees Council was due to apply to the High Court in London to force Ms Rogers to appear and show cause why she should not be committed to prison for the allegedly illegal Facebook posts. The application, which is being made by Lorraine Cavanagh on behalf of the local authority, was adjourned by Mr Justice Moylan to 15 August after he heard Ms Rogers needed time to obtain legal aid for lawyers to represent her. Summer’s grandfather James Ratcliffe has vowed to go on with his 25-year-old son Joss - Summer’s father - to fight for justice and set up the Facebook page on which Miss Rogers allegedly made her four posts. Over 2,000 people have signed a petition urging the CPS to reconsider the decision not to prosecute anyone. Mr Ratcliffe said he was 'flabbergasted to think that in 2014 an inquest found Summer was killed but no one has yet been made accountable'. Summer, who lived in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was a normal, healthy child in a family with no involvement with social services, her inquest heard. Scroll down for video . Justice: Summer's grandfather James Ratcliffe has vowed to go on with his 25-year-old son Joss - Summer's father, pictured - to make sure someone is held accountable for his granddaughter's death . Her parents split up when she was three months old. She was taken to hospital after being found unconscious in her cot at around 8.30am on Monday, February 27, 2012. She had a severely swollen brain, which was bruised and bleeding, and died hours later. A post-mortem examination revealed she had suffered a 'blunt force trauma' to her head. Ancillary nurse Miss Rogers, 27, Summer’s stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, were arrested seven months later as they were the only people in the house in the time frame of the death. All three insisted they had not touched the girl and did not know how she suffered the injuries. The family judge said in his ruling that Summer had a tantrum after returning from her grandmother’s house on the day before she was found dying. Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, pictured with her mother, was found unconscious in her cot in February 2012. She had a severely swollen brain, which was bruised and bleeding, and died hours later . In evidence, Miss Rogers said she had told her daughter: 'I’m sick of you coming home like this.' Mr Sharp claimed she told her daughter something to the effect of 'I can’t stand you any more'. The judge said: 'I... have no doubt that the mother was acutely distressed by Summer’s tantrum. I am satisfied that the mother is an emotionally fragile person who would have been deeply upset by the episode which followed Summer’s return home on the Sunday. 'The evidence does not, in my judgment, support the conclusion that anything was likely to have happened which would have caused Craig S [her stepfather] to lose his self-control in the two hours or so between the mother leaving home and Mrs R arriving. 'The evidence does support, in my judgment, the conclusion that something happened during the course of that night which caused the mother to lose her self-control. 'However hard the decision, having regard to the cumulative effect of all the evidence and, in particular, the matters referred to above, I have come to the clear conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence establishes that the injuries sustained by Summer were caused by her mother.'

"By . Stephanie Linning . A pet owner who reduced his dog to a bag of bones by depriving her of medication was today spared jail. Alexander McWilliams, 38, shocked RSPCA inspectors when he brought three-year-old Cleo, a legally registered pitbull terrier, to the door when they attended his flat in Kentish Town, north London in March. She was found to be suffering from a heart condition that caused her to be emaciated to the point where her spine and ribs were protruding. Vets were later forced to put her down. Bag of bones: Cleo was bloated, emaciated, with grossly overgrown claws and suffering from a serious heart condition when RSPCA inspectors rescued her in March. She weighed just 18.55kg . McWilliams was found guilty in his absence in July of two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a . protected animal by failing to provide adequate veterinary care and attention for its heart and skin condition. The RSPCA was called to his address in March after concerns were raised about a 'very thin dog'. RSPCA inspector Nicole Broster said: 'She was one of the thinnest living dogs I have ever seen. 'I was horrified to see how thin and weak she was - I did not think it was possible that any living animal could be so underweight - she was merely skin and bone. 'We took her straight to the vets who tried everything they could to save her but after a few days said there was nothing they could do to ease her suffering and the kindest thing to do was put her to sleep to prevent further suffering. 'They confirmed she had been suffering from emaciation and chronic heart failure, with associated pulmonary disease. She also had painful overgrown nails and a chronic skin disease. 'It was so desperately sad to see how much pain she was in.' Emaciated: Three-year-old Cleo, a pit bull terrier, was found by RSPCA inspectors at the first-floor flat of Alexander McWilliams in Kentish Town, north London. Two dogs are still in McWilliams' care . Prosecutor . Wendy Gutteridge, for the RSPCA, said: ‘On the 4 March, RSPCA . inspectors attended the defendant’s home which is a first floor flat. ‘Mr . McWilliams was outside exercising two dogs on the grounds outside the . block. He said he had further dogs inside - both registered pitbulls - one dog the inspectors had . no welfare concerns. ‘The other is the subject of these proceedings, a three-year-old called Cleo. Cleo . was bloated, emaciated, with grossly overgrown claws and suffering from . a serious heart condition, Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court heard. She weighed just 18.55kg when she was rescued from the flat. Ms Gutteridge said: ‘There is nothing to indicate the poor condition Cleo was in was anything other than the result of her untreated heart condition.' Rescued: The RSPCA said that there is no evidence that indicates the poor condition Cleo was found in by investigators was anything other than the result of her untreated heart condition . Records . from veterinary charity PDSA show McWilliams last took Cleo to the vets . three and a half months before the inspectors found her. Defence lawyer Margaret Anecha said . McWilliams plans to appeal the court’s guilty finding on two counts of . causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. She said: ‘The dog was registered with a vet, and he made every effort to try to ensure the dog did receive treatment.' Two dogs are still in McWilliams care. He was handed a 18-week sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to pay £250 costs, an £80 victim surcharge and must abide by a four-month curfew between 8pm and 7am. McWilliams was further disqualified from owning, keeping or participating from keeping animals for three years, suspended pending his appeal.","Three-year-old pitbull terrier Cleo was found emaciated and bloated .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Created: . 05:41 EST, 6 August 2014 . A primary school teacher who was sacked after she was spotted taking cocaine by a parent died after injecting herself with a horse tranquiliser. Lian Watson had been working as a veterinary nurse and had started using ketamine, which is also used as a horse tranquiliser, since losing her job as a teacher. Miss Watson was sacked from St Patrick’s Catholic Primary School in Heysham, Lancashire, after admitting that she had used cocaine on a number of occasions, including in a nightclub in front of an off duty police officer and a parent of a child in her class. Scroll down for video . The night before her death, Miss Watson, pictured, hosted a dinner party for her friend and colleague Miss Klecandova and two other friends, where one guest described her as being in 'good spirits' An inquest . into her death heard she died in February after injecting herself with . ketamine and other drugs used to put down horses, which she had stolen . from her friend and colleague who is a vet. Miss Watson, 30, took them from the boot of her friend’s car following a dinner party at her home in Scotforth, Lancashire. The . inquest, held at Lancaster Magistrates Court, heard that Miss Watson . had been using ketamine before her death. Four months before she died . she enrolled herself into a drug treatment programme led by a group . called Inspire but discharged herself shortly afterwards. The inquest . heard that Miss Watson, who was an accomplished horse rider and . well-known on the county's equestrian scene, was said to have often . assisted vet Olga Klecandova with visits. It . was told that it would be part of her role as an equestrian nurse to . stock up Miss Klecandova’s car dubbed a 'mobile hospital' with the . various drugs. The . night before her death, Miss Watson hosted a dinner party for Miss . Klecandova and two other friends, where one guest, Colm Earle, described . her as being in 'good spirits'. Miss Klevandova said her friend 'was . always very happy'. But Mr Earle said that after the dinner and when everyone had gone to . bed at around 11pm he noticed Miss Watson acting 'suspicious', before she went out to Miss Klecandova's car. He said he had initially thought she was stepping out of the house to drive somewhere and warned her against it. He . added: 'She muttered something to me and went out into the yard to the . back of Olga’s jeep. 'She . was rummaging in the back of the jeep. I didn’t know what she was . doing. I asked her if she was okay, I didn’t quite hear what she said, I . left her to it.' Mr Earle added that as he went to brush his teeth he noticed the . downstairs light on and saw Miss Watson lying on the floor in the . hallway. He said she had blood on her hand but had thought she had fallen and had cut herself. Miss Watson was found dead the following morning and was said to have multiple needle marks on her left forearm, hand, wrist and mid elbow as well as marks to her upper chest and under her breast, that had 'looked very fresh'. Pathologist Dr M. Al-Mudhaffer said that her cause of death had been respiratory depression due to combined drug use. Coroner Simon Jones said that the drugs would produce a central nervous system depression that would reduce breathing. Coroner Simon Jones said that someone who works with horses and cows 'may be expected to be aware of the consequences' of taking powerful drugs like ketamine . Toxicology tests revealed that ketamine was found in her blood as well . as a heart blocker drug and the sedative anaesthetic, which is . used to euthanise animals. Miss Klecandova told the inquest that her car, a Kia Sports Hatchback was like a mobile 'hospital', adding that Miss Watson would have known what medication was in the boot of her car. She added: 'She would help me, pass me the drugs. It was her job.' Police were called to the scene the morning of her death but ruled out any suspicious or third party involvement. Coroner Simon Jones returned a verdict of misadventure, adding that he believe she had taken an 'opportunity' to take the drugs. He said: 'What she did on this occasion she did on her own, no one else was involved, there are no suspicious circumstances. He added that one of the drugs, 'is used to put down large animals, horses and cows and so on the face of it someone who works in that field may be expected to be aware of the consequences of taking a dose of that. 'However I also have to bear in mind no note was left. I have the very clear evidence of her behaviour the night before from three friends describing her as being in good spirits. 'I believe against a background of past ketamine use, she has seen an opportunity, her friend and colleague’s parked car and the left substances in the boot. A likely explanation is she has taken the opportunity to appropriate drugs from the car.' Following . her death, a statement from international horse charity World Horse Welfare said that they were . 'saddened' to learn of Lian's death and that they offered their 'sincerest . condolences to her family and friends'. They . added that they would like to thank Miss Watson's family and friends . for their kind and generous donations, which they made in Miss Watson's honour . following her death. In 2011 Miss Watson had her case brought before the General Teaching Council after she was seen by a parent taking cocaine. She was sacked from her role as a teacher at St Patrick’s Catholic Primary School in Heysham, near Morecambe, Lancashire after admitting taking the Class A drug twice in 2006. At the time, the General Teaching Council chairman described Miss Watson as a 'competent teacher' and said that she 'demonstrated a passion for teaching'. The council found her behaviour was . ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ and issued a reprimand - the lowest . punishment available to them - allowing her to return to the profession . if she wished. The chairman added that she had 'a future contribution to make to the teaching profession'. However she never returned to teaching and changed careers becoming a veterinary nurse. Miss Watson was known for her horsemanship, competing in numerous dressage competitions and being listed on the British Eventing website. In 2008 she came third in the Working Hunter Pony jumping category at the Horse of the Year show with her horse, Meath Busy Body.","Veterinary nurse Lian Watson had been using ketamine before her death .

PC Jon Griffith, who was involved in the raid, said: 'I have been in the police 12 years and it’s the first time I have seen this [rapid entry with a chainsaw].' The raid was witnessed by stunned residents who watched as the police stormed the property in Woodmans Close. One said: 'It seems a bit over the top to use a chainsaw but it was better than watching morning TV.

'I ran outside to see what was going on and could hear screaming and a baby crying from inside. 'I suppose the police have got to send a message out about drugs but it was pretty heavy handed if you ask me.' But the force today defended the tactics, saying the raid had been a success. PC Paul Cound said: 'We are constantly getting reports from members of the public about drug dealing and taking. It is nice to have a positive outcome from the warrant.'

The chain saw is needed on specific doors or where certain conditions are identified by police in advance of the warrant being executed. Police cadets and police community support officers later performed ‘reassurance patrols’ in the area to explain to neighbours what had happened.","Officers wearing balaclavas raided house in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire .

"By . Stephanie Linning . This is the dramatic moment that a 15-year-old girl feared she would die after being sucked waist-deep into the mud during a stroll with friends. GCSE student Sophie, from Stretford, Greater Manchester, who has asked us not to use her surname, spent more than an hour trapped in Urmston Meadows in Manchester after veering from stable ground while out for a walk. She and her friends first laughed off the experience but soon panicked when they couldn't pull her out of the cold ground - and the teenager began to fear for her life. Scroll down for video . Trapped: Sophie was sucked waist-deep into the mud after veering off solid ground while out for a stroll with friends on Urmston Meadows, Manchester. Without anything to hold on to, the teenager sunk into the ground . She said: 'I was terrified, thought I’d never get out. At first my friends were laughing, but after an hour I still couldn’t get out so they decided to call the fire brigade. 'I thought they might send three firemen, but about 20 people turned up, fire engine, paramedics. the police... It’s not what I expected.' Sophie walked on the ground, which looked solid but she was quickly sucked below in to her waist with nothing to hold on to. The mud was so thick that her friends were unable to help her out. Sophie, who wanted to send a warning out to other walkers, has heaped praise on the rescuers who saved her on Sunday. She said: 'I would just say to people to check the ground before you walk on it, because it might look safer than it is. 'I don’t want to stop people going up there at all, it’s a beautiful place, but just be a bit careful. Warning: Sophie has told other walkers to pay extra attention to where they are walking, saying that the ground might look more stable than it is. Sophie was rescued by 20 firefighters an hour after she became stuck . 'I was lucky my friends had their phones with them, but I have seen people on their own. If you don’t have a phone to call for help you’d be in trouble. 'I’d like to thank all the firemen and the paramedics and the policewoman who drove me home afterwards.'

"By . Stephanie Linning . Atif Ali had to undergo a seven-hour surgery to save his life after he was shot on May 20 last year . A man accused of conspiring to murder an accountant today told a jury that the plan was only to injure the man - and used cockney rhyming slang to explain what happened. Bernard Pillay, from London, said that he had been told about the plan to injure accountant Atif Ali by businessman Shahzad Mahroof, who said he wanted to put Mr Ali in hospital with a broken leg. Pillay, 41, told a jury at Luton Crown Court how Mahroof had approached him with the idea, saying that he wanted someone to break Mr Ali's legs, who was allegedly his rival in a love triangle. Recounting the conversation, Pillay said that Mahroof suggested that it be done using a car or a baseball bat. But Pillay admitted that he proposed shooting the Mr Ali instead, saying that it was an 'efficient way of putting him in hospital'. He used cockney rhyming slang to explain the exchange. He said: '[Mahroof] wasn’t too specific about how he wanted this done. I said ""All this faffing about. Why don’t you just put one in his scotch""?' Asked what scotch meant, he replied 'Scotch egg - leg. It was a far more easier way than the complicated . ways he was suggesting.' Later in his testimony he referred to the 'jam jar', meaning car, and the 'April', which he explained meant 'April fool - tool'. Pillay said he first discussed the plan with Mr Mahroof during a boxing match at Bethnal Green’s York Hall in East London in April last year. Pillay denies conspiring to murder 28-year-old Mr Ali on May 20 last year. It is alleged Pillay shot Mr Ali in his left thigh with a single shot from a double-barrelled shotgun at close range after deliberately driving into the back of Mr Ali's car as he travelled to work. When Mr Ali got out to inspect the damage, it is claimed by the prosecution that Pillay jumped out of the Mondeo with the sawn-off shotgun and shot Mr Ali. Mr Ali survived after undergoing a seven-hour operation at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge. It is alleged by the prosecution that Shahzad Mahroof and the victim were part of a love triangle in competition for the hand of a young Luton woman, whom the Mr Ali was engaged to. The jury have heard that, as the animosity between the two men deepened, Mahroof wanted his rival out of the way so he could pursue a relationship with her. Crime scene officers at the road in Luton where it is alleged Bernard Pillay shot Mr Ali as he travelled to work in May last year. Pillay used cockney rhyming slang to explain the exchange that took place before the incident . Mahroof, from Luton and Pillay, from Uxbridge, west London along with four other men on trial, plead not guilty to conspiracy to murder Mr Ali. They have both pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, but the prosecution claim they are guilty of conspiring to murder Mr Ali. Giving evidence, Pillay said he was known for 'little bits of violence' and, as a result, got to hear about Mahroof’s 'problem'. He told the jury that Mr Mahroof 'had a problem' with a 'firm that was running around Luton'. He said: 'Part of this little ruffian firm needed hurting and he wanted a hospital jobby.' Pillay told the court there could be a 'nice few quid' in it for him, which he explained meant 'thousands'. Commenting on ways  Mahroof was suggesting his rival’s legs should be broken, which was a baseball bat attack and running him over, Pillay said: 'I was thinking that sort of stuff can get messy'. Pillay told the jury at Luton Crown Court, pictured, that shooting Mr Ali in the leg was a 'quick efficient way of putting him in hospital' after Mahrood had suggested 'using a car or a baseball bat' He said shooting the man in the leg was a 'quick, efficient way of putting him in hospital.' Continuing his evidence, he said there were further discussions with Mahroof over the phone about getting hold of a 'jam jar', meaning a car, for the job. Pillay said he left it to a friend to source the weapon to be used. He said: 'I left him to get the April - that was his department.' Asked what April meant, he told the court it was short for 'April Fool - tool'. Earlier, Mahroof told the jury he believed Mr Ali had been organising a plan for him to be attacked. He said he had no reason to want the accountant dead and told Pillay: 'Do what you have to do as long as his leg is broken.' Mahroof, of Luton, Pillay, 41, from Uxbridge, Matthew McCafferty, 23, from Flitwick, Mark O’Neil, 41, from Hayes, Middlesex, Mahboob Baig, 31, from Luton and Sajed Hussain, 31, from Luton, all plead not guilty to conspiring to murder Mr Ali on May 20 last year. Mr Pillay, say the prosecution, was the gunman that morning, Mr McCafferty is alleged to have supplied the shotgun. Mr O’Neil, is said to have been given the job of driving Mr Pillay up to Luton to carry out the shooting and Mr Baig is said to have been 'co-ordinating' the shooting. Mr Hussain’s role is said to have been as a 'spotter'. Mr McCafferty, Mr Baig, Mr O’Neil and Mr Hussain also deny conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm on Mr Ali. The jury have been told Mahroof and Pillay have pleaded guilty to this charge. Mahroof also denies making a threat to kill Mr Ali, and Mr McCafferty denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, having a firearm with intent and possessing a prohibited firearm. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Bernard Pillay told the court that he was brought into a plan to injure Atif Ali .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Police are hunting for two fraudsters who pocketed £50,000 by selling someone else’s house. The two men put the terraced home in Exhall, Warwickshire, on the market through a specialist agency and managed to complete a sale using fake driving licences. Their scam was only uncovered when the Land Registry looked at the sale and found out that the names on the two IDs - of the man and woman who actually owned the house - did not match the photos, which were of two men. Suspects: Warwickshire police are looking for the two men pictured above in connection with the scam. The names used on the IDs used in the sale, of a man and a woman, were correct, but did not match the photos . Police are now unable to trace the pair - who had no link to the property - and believe it is the first time the scam has been pulled off in Britain. Warwickshire Police has released the pictures of two Asian men used on the fake driving licences in a bid to track down the fraudsters. The terraced home was listed for sale on a specialist buy-to-let website in 2012 and the sale was finalised in December that year. It was vacant at the time because the occupants had moved elsewhere. Although the sale had been completed by the fraudsters, when the documents were lodged for registration  with Land Registry the fraud was detected and the forged deeds rejected. And a man from Northampton who had bought the property managed to get his money back from insurers. Detective Constable Simon Setchell, from Warwickshire Police, said: 'The money that went into the bank account was very quickly withdrawn and spirited away to purchase gold bullion and other things. Listed online: A street in Exhall, Warwickshire, where the property was put up for sale. Warwickshire police said that the owner of the home had no idea what was going on . 'They knew what they were doing. We’ve spoken to the owner of the home who wasn’t particularly impressed - he certainly had no idea what was going on. 'This gentleman became aware that this property was for sale. He asked a solicitor in Milton Keynes to carry out a purchase for him which they did via a company in Rugby. 'Two Asian males purporting to be the owners of the property provided proof of ID as required to the Rugby solicitor and the sale went through. 'Fortunately the Land Registry were carrying out some sample testing and they looked at the driving licences of the owner and his wife used in the sale. 'The names were correct but the pictures used were both of males. 'The property was listed at a reduced price which drew the buyer’s attention to it. This was an extraordinary crime, in which those involved were able to fraudulently deceive everyone involved in the sale of the house for their own gain. 'We have been investigating all lines of inquiry into this case, and we hope that by releasing the photographs which were used on the fake driving licences, we can track down the individuals whom we wish to speak to.'","Two men listed terraced house in Exhall, Warwickshire on specialist website .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Georgina Dean outside Norwich Crown Court yesterday. It was heard that Dean wore a medical uniform and claimed to work for medical groups . A fraudster who sold cheap mattresses to elderly people for up to £700, claiming they had magical healing powers. Georgina Dean, 39, who is also known as Elizabeth, paid home visits to vulnerable pensioners while dressed in a medical uniform, Norwich Crown Court heard. She found her customers by buying a list of residents over the age of 70 on the internet. Dean told many of her customers that she was part of a larger medical organisation and that the mattresses she was selling could help heal their ailments and illnesses - telling one victim that it would 'stop Parkinsons' disease'. In fact the mattresses, which she sold for up to £700, could be bought for just £30 on eBay. Dean was brought before the court following a . two-year investigation by officers from Norfolk Trading Standards after . she targeted vulnerable pensioners in the community as part of her scam. Judge Anthony Bate told Dean that she deserved to go to jail after she was convicted of two counts of fraudulent trading. But he suspended the her prison sentence as he ordered her to compensate the victims of her scam. Dean, of Wymondham, Norfolk, operated under two different trading names, Norfolk Eco and the Green Leaf Group, which she claimed were medical organisations, as she targeted pensioners. The mattresses could be bought for just £30 on eBay but she was selling them at up to £700, her trial at Norwich Crown Court heard in June. Jamie Sawyer, prosecuting for Norfolk Trading Standards, said: 'She was a one-man band, acting as a sole trader, although she gave the impression to customers she was part of a larger organisation.' He added: 'Contrary to what she told many of her customers she had no medical training and was in effect a latter day ‘snake oil’ salesman.' Mr Sawyer said Dean, who used to wear a medical uniform, got a list of potential customers on the Internet targeting people aged 70 or over. He said she would arrange a home visit and focus on their medical complaints, which varied from diabetes to arthritis. The daughter of one victim told the court how it was about 'more than the money', saying that her mother's 'confidence has been shaken' as a result of her encounter with Dean. Mr Sawyer said: 'She would represent that the mat would assist with these conditions, going so far on one occasion as to state that the mat would stop Parkinson’s disease,' said Mr Sawyer. Matthew McNiff, defending, yesterday insisted that not all Dean’s customers were elderly and said the sales had been 'infrequent'. He told Norwich Crown Court: 'There was never any attempt for her to hide her name, her address, her contact details.' Judge Bate yesterday sentenced Dean to nine months in jail suspended for two years. The fraudster was brought before Norwich County Court following a two-year investigation by officers from Norfolk Trading Standards after she targeted vulnerable pensioners in the community as part of her scam . He said that she had made £4000 from the scam and ordered her to pay back £500 a month compensation. Sentencing, he told Dean: 'It could be said you richly deserve to go to prison. However, there is a better prospect of the losers being compensated if you are able to retain your liberty and work the losses off.' Gary Young, principal trading standards officer at Norfolk County Council, said after the case: 'Georgina Dean deliberately set out to target elderly people with known medical conditions. 'She did this by buying a list of potential customers over the age of 70 from the internet. She then went on to cynically scam them. 'This is about more than the money. Mum’s confidence has been shaken to bits as a result of her encounter with Dean' - Carol, daughter of one of Dean's victims . 'Dean earned her victims’ trust by dressing in a medical uniform when she visited them and claiming to be part of medical organisations.' He added: 'She built up relationships with her “clients” by phoning them at home, appearing to be concerned about their medical problems by asking them further questions, telling them she had something which could help alleviate their condition and arranging a home visit to demonstrate it. 'She also lied to people to make a sale. One of our witnesses gave evidence in court that Dean told them a mattress she was trying to sell them would ""stop Parkinson’s disease"" 'If these tactics weren’t bad enough, she would demonstrate a mattress but say that it wasn’t currently available - and that there would be new stock shortly. Norfolk Trading Standards manager Shaun Norris said: 'This sentence is the result of a thorough investigation of the crimes Dean committed and the horrible way she manipulated her victims. Carol, the daughter of one of Dean’s victims, who is in her late 80s and lives in Norwich, said last night: 'Dean came round, demonstrated a massage pad and mum signed a piece of paper agreeing to pay £220 for unit and paid £100 cash deposit.' She said they cancelled the order but her mum had lost her deposit. 'That was tough but this is about more than the money. Mum’s confidence has been shaken to bits as a result of her encounter with Dean,' she said.","Georgina Dean, from Wymondham, Norfolk, claimed to have medical training .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A university student who works at Tesco claimed that he has been threatened with the sack over his bright red mohawk - even though his manager's hair is dyed the same colour. Max Cole, 20, turned up with the bold red hairstyle to his shift at Tesco in his hometown of Crediton, Devon, where he works to fund his studies at York University. He was sent home with no pay because of his new look, despite the fact that his manager's hair is dyed the same colour. Mr Cole said that other employees working at the Tesco Extra branch have their hair dyed 'unnatural colours'. 'Inappropriate': Second-year York University student Max Cole was sent home without pay when he arrived for his shift at Tesco Extra in his hometown of Crediton, Devon, with his mohawk that is streaked with red dye . The second-year undergraduate student said he changed his hairstyle frequently in order to express his 'individuality. He described his previous 'normal' haircut - a short crew cut just slightly overgrown - as 'looking a bit shabby'. After being told his new hairstyle was not 'business-like or smart', Max was ordered out of the store empty handed and told he’d otherwise face the sack, despite female staff having 'an array of unnatural colours in their hair'. Acceptable: Mr Cole has dyed his hair back to black, and has to style it flat, in order to continue working at the store over summer . 'All my managers have dyed red hair too - which adds to how unfair it is.' A Tesco source suggested that it was the style of Mr Cole's hair, rather than the colour, that was the reason behind his being asked to leave. The student says the job is crucial to helping him fund his degree in Genetics, but his managers were quick to tell him to leave when he arrived at the store with his bold style. Mr Cole said he styled his hair to look like Iranian NASA scientist Bobak . Ferdowski, who has attracted attention for his own red-streaked mohawk. He said that he was immediately asked to leave the store when he arrived with the new cut. He said: 'Before I could even clock in, I was taken off the shop floor by my line manager and was told I was not allowed to be on the shop floor with my current hair style due to it being inappropriate and was told that I had to go home and would not be paid for the day. 'Feeling this decision was completely unjust I went to the manager’s office and requested to see the personnel manager, who I thought would be the one, if anyone, to be on my side. 'However she took the general opinion of my hair being unacceptable for work, despite me pointing out that several managers have red hair, and other employees have an array of unnatural colours in their hair in several different styles.' 'Unfair': Mr Cole, who is a genetics student, said that he was unfairly targetted as other employees - including his line manager - all work in the store with dyed hair . Inspiration: Mr Cole, who used to have a 'normal' crew cut, said he styled his hair to look like Iranian NASA scientist Bobak Ferdowski, pictured, who has attracted attention for his own red-streaked mohawk . Max says he worked in the same store as a teenager when his hair was bleached white, to which staff never raised an eyebrow. He added: 'I was told that I am allowed to keep my black mohawk, but will be fired if I dye it red, which I once again I stated I felt was unfair due to the numerous number of female employees with red hair.' A Tesco spokesperson said: ‘We ask our colleagues to serve our customers in a smart and professional manner. Max has discussed this with his Personnel Manager and it’s great that he is continuing to work with us through his summer break’.","York University student Max Cole works at Tesco Extra in Crediton, Devon .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt tonight hit out at BBC presenter Gabby Logan for saying that the Commonwealth Games would be 'okay' without him after leading his team to victory in their relay heat. Speaking in an interview with the BBC shortly after the race, the athlete said: 'I heard somebody say they enjoyed the games without Blake and me,' referring to a comment Mrs Logan had made about him and fellow Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake. He continued: 'Yeah you, I am talking to you, she knows who I am talking to.' Scroll down for video... Speaking in an interview with the BBC, Usain Bolt hit out at comments he said Gabby Logan made about him and his teammate, fellow Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake . Usain Bolt sauntered down the home straight to lead his team safely into the men's 4x100m relay final, which will be held tomorrow . The Jamaican sprinter was greeted by applause and the lights from thousands of camera flashes as he stepped into the stadium for his Commonwealth Games debut . Apparently unaware that he was speaking the the BBC, the athlete addeded: 'They are in the stadium aren't they? The BBC, Michael Johnson, I'm not going to call names, they know who they are.' 'I'm a fun person, I love to have fun, look at me,' before pulling a face to the camera and walking away. Gabby Logan later defended what she said, insisting she meant that the Games were 'better' with Bolt . The comments came after Bolt made his much-anticipated debut at the Commonwealth Games. Six days . after arriving in Glasgow, the world's fastest man took . to the track to run the anchor leg for Jamaica in the heats of the 4x100 . metres relay. The . six-time OIympic champion sauntered down the home stretch to help his team cruise into the final. Bolt took the baton from . Nickel Ashmeade and brought his team across the line in first in 38.99 . seconds before applauding the crowd. Their win means that the Jamaican team qualify for the relay finals that will take place tomorrow. Speaking after the win, Bolt once again denied a report in The Times earlier this week that he told a reporter that the Commonwealth Games were 'bulls***'. He . told BBC One: 'It's wonderful, just like the London Olympics. The crowd . is great. I have heard it throughout the championships and watched it . on the television. 'I . can't believe she [Times reporter Katie Gibbons] actually said that. I . would never use that word. I love competing and I am here because of the . fans. Usain Bolt, right, sailed past the other athletes in the final stretch of the race, securing his team's place in the final . 'I am enjoying it. The people have been good to me and I would never say that. 'Everything's . been good for me. It's just the weather. It's got cold. But I am happy . to be here and I am enjoying what's going on.' Of . his first taste of action in Glasgow, he said: 'We told each other just . to get it [the baton] round and not to stress too much about this one.' He then said that there was one more thing he had to say, before launching his attack on Gabby Logan. Usain Bolt was keen to put the controversy of the week behind him, being playful in front of the camera and taking time to enjoy the applause from the thousands of fans gathered in Hampton Park . Mrs Logan could be heard laughing with her fellow BBC presenters as Usain Bolt walked away from the interview, before saying, 'I got a bit rumbled'. She then went on to defend the comment she made on Thursday. She said: 'What I said was that it was okay without him and that now he is here it is better.' 'We now know that he is watching. He knows that we are fair and he is fair too,' before quickly changing the topic back to the Times scandal. Bolt's name . was greeted with a huge cheer when it was first read out by the stadium . announcer and the roars only grew when he was introduced to the . crowd out on to the track. There he stopped to interact with fans - even fist pumping one young girl on the front row. Fans made Bolt feel welcome with a hug round of applause when his name was announced over the loudspeakers before the race . Yesterday it emerged that three security guards were reportedly 'sacked' from the Commonwealth Games for taking selfies with the runner. The members of staff employed by Sword Security were on duty at the Lesser Hampden training ground in Glasgow yesterday when they are said to have approached the fastest man in the world to ask for a photo. They were then 'punted' or sacked by a supervisor who had asked them to put their mobile phones away while the Jamaican sprinter was training. Bolt, second from right, takes the baton before running the final stretch of the relay . It was the latest controversy surrounding the Jamaican sprinter who apparently told a reporter that the Commonwealth Games were 'bulls***' However, after watching the Jamaican netball team lose to New Zealand on Wednesday, the 27-year-old said they were in fact ‘awesome’ and dismissed his earlier alleged negative remarks as ‘all lies’. Bolt is said to have complained about Glasgow 2014 to The Times as he waited in the rain for a car outside the athletes’ village on Tuesday, just hours after meeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. However, while the six-time Olympic champion on Wednesday denied making the comments, the paper has stood firmly by its story. Yesterday it published the full transcript between journalist Katie Gibbons and the athlete, with Scottish editor Angus Macleod declaring: ‘We stand by this story 100 per cent.’","Jamaican sprinter hit out at Logan after making Commonwealth debut .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A primary school headmaster has come under fire after he took time off during term time to compete in an international triathlon in the Austrian Alps. Paul Simon Abeledo, 45, is being investigated after he flew out to take part in the ETU Triathlon championship in picturesque town of Kitzbühel on June 20. For parents, taking their children out of school during term time can mean sanctions, fines and the threat of legal action. Photos posted online show Mr Abeledo at different stages of the gruelling event in the Austrian Alps. He has taken part in a number of European triathlons . Amateur athlete: Paul Abeledo competes at the ETU Triathlon championship in Kitzbuhel last month. He has come under fire after he took time off during term time to take part in the international event . But it is unclear whether similar rules apply for the primary school, who is headmaster of Rush Green Primary School in London. The father-of-one, who is a keen runner, cyclist and swimmer, is now facing criticism after a whistleblower complained to his school’s chairman of governors and local council chiefs. Under fire: Mr Abeledo  is being investigated after he flew out to take part in the ETU Triathlon championship in picturesque town of Kitzbühel . Parents who take their child out of . school in term can be fined £60, which increases to £120 if it is not . paid within 28 days. Failure to pay can result in court action. In May, a 10-year-old girl was . refused time off school to attend her grandfather's funeral because the . reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'. Demi Hodge, a student at Hansbury Farm Primary School, Tamworth, was told that she couldn't attend the service and her parents were threatened with a £1,000 fine. And last month a mother from Shrewsbury, Shropshire was told that she would face criminal proceedings if she took her son out of school so that he could attend her weekday wedding. Council bosses in Barking and Dagenham are trying to establish if the amateur athlete received the go-ahead to leave school during the week to participate in the gruelling event. Pictures posted online by Marathon Photos show Mr Abeledo competing in the ETU Triathlon in the  Austrian Alps during the summer term. A Barking and Dagenham Council spokesman said: 'The chairman of governors, with support from the local authority, has set up an independent investigation to look into the matter.' Neither Mr Abeledo nor school governors would comment on the row last night. Records at triathlon.org show Mr Abeledo, who competed in the sprint distance event,  finished in 43rd place in the 45-to-49 male category - completing the 750-metre swim, 19.7km bike ride and 4.8km run in one hour, 19 minutes 26 seconds. Time off: Rush Green Primary School in London. Parents who take their children out of school during term time face sanctions, fines of up to £120 and the threat of legal action . Mr Abeledo, who’s been headmaster at Rush Green Primary School for the last year, has competed in triathlons all over Europe. The ambitious teacher took part in the Pontevedra ITU Duathlon World Championships in Spain during half term, three weeks before the Kitzbühel event. He also competed in the Horst ETU Powerman Long Distance and Sprint Duathlon European Championships in Holland during the Easter holidays in April as well as tackling the elite Iron Man triathlon in Switzerland in July 2010. Mr Abeledo describes himself as 'focused, driven and relentless' on his profile page on top worldwide business network Linked In. In May, a 10-year-old girl was refused time off school to attend her grandfather's funeral because the reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'. Demi Hodge, of Hansbury Farm Primary School in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was told she could not attend the service in Watford, Hertfordshire - and her parents were threatened with a £1,000 fine. The day before the funeral, her parents Gaynor, 39, and Leigh Hodge, 41, who had sent the form one week earlier - received a letter from headmaster Peter Hollis refusing the request. Mr and Mrs Hodge decided to risk the fine and take Demi to the funeral, and it was only once they contacted the school to see if they would be punished that they were told the refusal was a mistake. The school told Mrs Hodge that the headmaster had not read the letter properly and did not know the request related to a funeral. Mr Hodge has since ‘apologised unreservedly’ for the error. Service: Demi Hodge, pictured with her parents Gaynor, 39, and Leigh, 41, was told by Hansbury Farm Primary School in Tamworth, that she could not attend her grandfather's funeral in Watford, Hertfordshire . Facing criminal prosecution: Clare and Andrew McLeary with their son Riley Bryan, nine, moments after getting married in Cornwall . Last month a mother from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was told she would face criminal proceedings if she took her son out of school so that he could attend her weekday wedding. Clare McLeary flouted a school ruling by taking nine-year-old son Riley Bryant out of lessons so he could watch her tying the knot with fiancé Andy McLeary, 37, on Lusty Gaze beach in Newquay, Cornwall. Mrs McLeary, 30, who works as a police call handler, wrote to Clive Church of England School asking for permission to let Riley miss three days this week. But the school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as ‘exceptional circumstances’. The couple, who have been together for three years, are now facing a criminal prosecution and believe their wedding pictures might be used in court to prove Riley’s unauthorised absence from school. Mary Lucas, headteacher at the school, said: 'The school will only authorise leave in exceptional circumstances. I would have been happy to talk to the parents about this request if they had come to see me.' Other recent cases include that of a mother who defied a council’s bid to gag her after she was prosecuted for taking her children on holiday in term time. Janice Skelcher - who is now fighting for a change in the law - and her husband Ian took their two children to visit family in Australia. She said the three-week trip had to be during term time as she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged. They refused to pay a £240 fine imposed by Coventry City Council and were prosecuted.","Paul Simon Abeledo took part in ETU Triathlon championship in Kitzbühel .

"By . Stephanie Linning . An RAF veteran who became a personal trainer to the stars has been spared jail after he admitted to possessing a shotgun without a certificate. Cain Leathem, 47, claimed on his website to have worked with a string of celebrities, including former Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore, DJ Kate Lawler and ex-Olympic relay champion Mark Lewis-Francis. Police found the double-barrelled weapon at Leathem’s Birmingham home when his wife called officers following a public argument last month. Celebrity support: Cain Leathem, pictured, admitted possessing a shotgun without a certificate but avoided jail after the judge read references from some of his more famous clients, including Olympic medallists . Leathem admitted possessing a shotgun without a certificate but avoided jail after the judge, Recorder Patrick Upward QC, read references from some of his star clients. Mr Upward did not name those who vouched for Leathem but said they included Olympic medallists and Commonwealth Games athletes. Imposing an eight-month suspended sentence, the judge told him: 'Possessing an unlicensed firearm is very serious and can have consequences far beyond the contemplation of the person in whose house the weapon is found. 'I bear in mind your excellent service record and the support you have had from members of the public.' Leathem, of Druids Heath, Birmingham, is the founder of GB Fitness and spent five years as an RAF aircraft weapons technician. His firm was described on its website as an 'exercise and nutritional consultancy'. Star clients: On his website, Leathem claims to have worked with a string of celebrities including former Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore, left, DJ Kate Lawler, right and ex-Olympic relay champion Mark Lewis-Francis . Cain Leathem with one of his clients, female bodybuilder Claire Adams. Leathem, of Druids Heath, Birmingham, is the founder of GB Fitness and spent five years as an RAF aircraft weapons technician . On the site, Leathem claimed his other clients had included ex-Walsall and England striker Michael Ricketts, former Wolves player Carl Cort and Diane Youdale - Jet from TV’s Gladiators. Birmingham Crown Court heard Leathem left the RAF five years ago. Rebecca Wade, prosecuting, said the defendant 'slapped his wife in the face in public in the course of a disagreement between the two of them'. Police became involved after the couple had a row at the Isle of Wight music festival on June 14. Leathem denied having access to guns but officers who searched his home the following day found the weapon, wrapped in white cloth, in the rafters of the garage. Public argument: Police visited Leathem's Birmingham home following a row with his wife Claire, pictured, at the Isle of Wight festival. The prosecutor said Leathem slapped Mrs Leathem during the fall out . Searched: The house where Cain Leahtem stored his shotgun. He received an eight-month suspended sentence and was ordered to perform 100 hours unpaid work and pay £420 in costs . It was unloaded and appeared to be in good condition, the court heard. Mr Upward said it was an 'exceptional' case and he accepted Leathem’s claim that the gun had been unused in his garage for ten years. The defendant was also ordered to perform 100 hours unpaid work and pay £420. Rex Tedd QC, defending, said Leathem served in the RAF in a specialist role, was of previous good character and had helped those who had suffered serious injury during recent conflicts. 'He has an excellent service record, has a very good business as a personal trainer and is very highly thought of,' Mr Tedd said. 'He is also someone who has helped those who have suffered grievously during the time of recent conflicts. 'Relations between him and his wife appear to have been patched up, although they are not together.' Writing on a fundraising website last year, Leathem described himself as a keen motorbike rider. He helped raise almost £2,000 for the Bike Tours for the Wounded initiative, which sends injured servicemen on US motorcycle tours as pillion passengers. A profile of Leathem on another website said he was born in the Gorbals area of Glasgow but grew up in Birmingham and dropped out of his A-level studies to join the RAF.","Cain Leathem, 47, worked with former Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore and DJ Kate Lawler .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Last month it was revealed that Pippa Middleton and boyfriend Nico Jackson were house-hunting for a south London home. But it would seem that any plans for moving in will have to be put on hold - with a new job for the London-based broker set to take their relationship long distance. Mr Jackson, who has been dating Miss Middleton for nearly two years, will be swapping the City for Switzerland next month, according to the Evening Standard. He is set to quit his job at Deutsche Bank to take on a new role at a multi-billion pound hedge fund in Geneva. Long distance love: Mr Jackson, who has been dating Miss Middleton, 30, for eighteen months, is set to swap the City for Switzerland next month. He will leave his role at Deutsche Bank to join a Geneva hedge fund . Perfect match: The couple take in the action during the men's semi-finals at Wimbledon. Mr Jackson will join Jabre Capital, whose co-founders include Dr Mark Cecil - a close friend of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Elegant: Engagement rumours first emerged after the pair, pictured at an event in November, took a romantic trip to India last year. The couple also holidayed with Mr Jackson's grandparents earlier this year . The move comes amid growing speculation that he and Miss Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's 30-year-old sister, are about to tie the knot. In March the couple holidayed with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps, as suspicions grew that an engagement may not be too far off. And last week the couple looked very much in love as they watched the Wimbledon men's final alongside Miss Middleton parents, Carole and Michael. The pair, who were seen chatting and sharing jokes in the stands at SW19, were first seen publicly together at a nightclub opening in 2012. A source close to the couple told the Evening Standard that: 'They are very much an item, their relationship is very strong and they are very happy together.' Mr Jackson, 36, is reportedly leaving his role as a stockbroker at Deutsche Bank to join £1.6billion fund Jabre Capital as an investment manager in Geneva. Night out: The couple last May. Earlier this year Miss Middleton, who previously dated former England cricketer Alex Loudon, showed how serious she was about Mr Jackson by taking him to the wedding of a close friend . The fund . was founded in 2006 and claims to offer 'a diversified range of . investment management services and products... to a broad network of . institutional and high net worth clients,' according to its website. The . fund's founding partners include Dr Mark Cecil, 55, an Old Harrovian . who qualified as a doctor at St Thomas' Hospital in London before . switching to finance.

"By . Stephanie Linning . A coroner has slammed an award-winning hospital after a great-grandmother died after becoming dehydrated when she was ignored by staff for five hours. Anne Sandever, 77, was admitted to Walnut Ward at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Cambridgeshire, at 10.30am but wasn’t seen by a doctor or nurse until the afternoon, an inquest at Huntingdon Coroner's Court heard. The court also heard how hospital staff missed the fact that the mother-of-four was diabetic, despite it being in her charts. 'It shouldn't have happened': Anne Sandever, pictured with her husband Brian. Mr Sandever said that he hoped that 'there's something better for the next person' who is in a similar situation to his late wife . Speaking at the inquest, her daughter branded the care she received 'appalling' while her husband said that 'it shouldn't have happened'. Mrs Sandever, who was a part-time NHS receptionist at Eaton Socon Health Centre in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, was left severely dehydrated . when she waited for five hours without the fluid she was taking from an . IV drip. She was then left for eight hours overnight without fluids . after medics failed to notice the intravenous drip had become . unattached, the inquest was told. Mrs Sandever died from renal failure on February 6 - three days after being admitted to the hospital which was recently named 'Best in England' for quality of care by healthcare consultancy firm CHKS. She leaves behind 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Assistant coroner for South and West Cambridgeshire, Dr Sam Bass, said if it had been his mother he would be 'very disappointed' and Mrs Sandever had been 'done a disservice'. Critcising medics during the inquest last week, Dr Bass said that he would write to Hinchingbrooke Hospital to raise his concerns in a bid to prevent future deaths. He said: 'One of the issues I have is you can only spot a deteriorating patient if someone actually looks at them, and it does seem that no one had seen her from 10.30 in the morning. Ignored: Mrs Sandever, who was diabetic, was not seen for five hours after arriving at Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire . 'I’m a doctor so I understand. I know it’s short staffed I know there’s issues[...]and all the cuts but she came in and she arrived on the ward and she wasn’t even seen or spoken to until sometime in the afternoon. 'What happened to actually talking to the patient? Finding out who they are, what they do. We’ve missed the fact she’s dehydrated, we’ve missed the fact she’s diabetic. 'I can’t see there’s an excuse for that, however many pieces of paper we fill in. 'I think we have missed something here and I’m afraid if it was my mum and if it was your mum I’m sure you would be very disappointed.' Mrs Sandever was taken from her home in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, to Hinchingbrooke Hospital on recommendation of her GP in February as she was suffering from a diarrhoea illness. The inquest heard that her medical notes showed medical observations were taken at 10.20am and she arrived on Walnut Ward at 10.30am. But medics who gave evidence to the inquest could not present the coroner with any records showing Mrs Sandever had been seen before 3.30pm that afternoon. Mrs Sandever’s daughter, Chelle Ritchie, who works in care as a service manager for Royal Mencap Society, criticised nurses for not speaking to her mother. Mrs Ritchie said: She spoke to me, my dad and my daughter on the phone but no medical staff came near her. 'I’ve worked in the care industry and I understand staff shortages. The whole point of the nursing profession is to communicate with people. I think it’s absolutely appalling. 'There was just no interaction from any nurse who came on that ward that day.' Mrs Sandever’s husband, Brian, also hit out at the care his wife received at the hospital. Under fire: Critcising medics during the inquest last week, Dr Bass said that he would write to Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Cambridgeshire, pictured, to raise his concerns in a bid to prevent future deaths . He said when he told nurses his wife’s drip was empty they dismissed him and said, 'no, she’s having no more treatment. There’s no more treatment for her'. He added: 'She [the nurse] said no no but I’ll go and ask a doctor. I went back in to see my wife and within ten minutes world war three had broken out. 'There was doctors, nurses, everything was going off and that was the last time I spoke to her. That was it. 'I’m just hoping there’s something better for the next person. It shouldn’t have happened.' 'I’m just hoping there’s something better for the next person. It shouldn’t have happened' - Brian Sandever, Anne's husband . Mr Sandever said that the care his wife received in the critical care ward, where she was moved to from Walnut Ward. Dr Martin Goddard, a consultant pathologist at Papworth hospital, said Mrs Sandever’s care at Hinchingbrooke was 'sub optimal' but he believed it did not cause her death. He added she was 'an obese lady' of 118kg with underlying health problems, including kidney trouble and a history of high blood pressure. Dr Goddard recorded a primary cause of death as renal failure with a secondary cause of clogged arteries and diabetes. Speaking after the inquest, Hisham Abdel-Rahman, Clinical Chairman and Chief Executive of Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust, apologised 'unreservedly'. He said: 'We are deeply sorry that this happened, and apologise unreservedly to the family. 'The coroner’s verdict recorded natural causes of death and no evidence of neglect. However, it highlighted shortcomings, particularly in monitoring and communication. 'We fully accept this: our internal investigation arrived at the same conclusion, and we will make sure the lessons are applied across the hospital. 'Patient safety is our highest priority and we will do everything we can to improve the quality of care, in full cooperation with the ruling.'","Anne Sandever was admitted to Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Cambridgeshire .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Residents in Cambridge are furious after the city council spent £35,000 building Britain's most expensive bird nesting box, saying that the money could have been better spent elsewhere. The colourful 33ft-high steel tower was built in 2011 as part of a plan to reverse the decline in the number of swifts - a species which sees its population fall by three per cent each year due to a loss of habitat. But the hi-tech bird box has sat empty in a field for three years, with its first feathered inhabitants only moving in this summer. Summer visitors: The steel structure, which was built in 2011, features 200 nesting boxes for swifts. The birds spend most of the year in southern Africa, arriving in the UK to breed between May and late July . New home: A swift darts out of the tower on the outskirts of Cambridge. The species nest in old buildings but have seen their numbers decline by three per cent each year as these buildings are renovated or demolished . African sun: The colours of the nesting boxes were inspired by the sun in Africa - where swifts live for most of the year. Cambridge city councillors say the specialist nest is helping to reverse the decline in the species . The tower, which features 200 nesting boxes, was built at Logan’s Meadow nature reserve on the outskirts of Cambridge as part of a wider wetland habitat creation plan in 2011. It was commissioned by . Cambridge City Council and created by London-based artist Andrew . Merritt, who worked with ecologists and swift experts to combine design . with a functional home for the birds. The design is inspired by the colours of the African sunset - where the birds live for most of the year - and recorded bird calls are played through loudspeakers built into the tower in order to attract young swifts. But some residents feel that the money, which was donated by housing developers to be used for public art, could have been used to benefit the local community. Helen Phillips, 43 said: 'I can’t believe they have spent so much money building a bird’s nest. 'The money would have been much better spent on facilities for the local community, such as a children’s playground. 'It’s ridiculous that they have spent thousands building a nest which hasn’t even been used for three years.' Standing tall: The tower stands in Logan's Meadow nature reserve on the outskirts of Cambridge. Recorded bird calls are played from loudspeakers  to try and attract visiting swifts to the nests . City councillors say the special nest is helping to play an important part in reversing the decline of swifts. The birds come to the UK to breed, arriving in mid-May and staying until late July when they return to Africa. They nest in old buildings but each year their population declines by three per cent as these buildings are knocked down or renovated. Nesting boxes: Some of the 200 boxes that make up the top part of the tower. It was designed by artist Andrew Merritt, who worked with ecologists and swift experts to combine design with a functional home for the birds . Local volunteers from Action For Swifts worked with the council and the artist to create the specialist nest. Councillor Carina O’Reilly said: 'This is fantastic news for this innovative project, which is helping biodiversity in the city by providing a habitat for this important species. 'Now the swifts have found it, it should provide a great spectacle every summer as the birds demonstrate their exhilarating flying skills around the tower.' Guy Belcher, nature conservation officer for Cambridge City Council, said: 'Although these young birds are not expected to breed this year, the activity is extremely encouraging and we predict breeders next year, following their return from Southern Africa.'","Cambridge City Council built the 33ft high nesting box in 2011 .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Two men who stripped off to take a dip in the sea in Northern Ireland were threatened with a criminal record and warned that they might be added to the sex offenders' register. Pictures that emerged online of the event show a naked man standing in Belfast Lough in County Down, hands over his private parts, with two police officers speaking to him as he made his way towards the shore. Campaigners said it is 'absolutely monstrous' that the police have decided to pass the case to the public prosecutor’s office, who has yet to decide whether the two men should be charged with indecent exposure. Skinny dipping: This picture shows one of the men standing in Belfast Lough talking to two police officers as he walks towards the shore. The police warned the men could be added to the sex offenders' register . The Police Service of Northern Ireland took to Facebook to warn people against similar behaviour. In a post last week, the police said: . 'NOT a good idea, we are treating this kind of behaviour extremely seriously and will be continuing to take action against anyone who decides to do the same.' It added: 'There are young children in these areas too. You could end up with a Criminal Record and placed on the Sex Offender Register.' Michael McDonald, North Down and Ards Area Commander Chief Inspector,  said: 'We have consistently said we want people to come to local beauty spots and enjoy a day out with family and friends.' 'However, we have also been very clear that a robust approach will be taken against those who break the law or do not comply with the ban on alcohol in public areas. 'Visitors have the right to enjoy their day without fear or concern in relation to the behaviour of others. He added: 'We want people to act responsibly and with consideration for others and taking your clothes off in a very busy area with lots of young children about is neither responsible or considerate. 'As police officers, we want people to think about the consequences of their actions, something that seems like a bit of fun to you could bring you to the attention of police who will deal with you accordingly and appropriately and you could end up before a court and with a criminal record.' Beauty spot: Belfast Lough, County Down. The police said that they encouraged people to enjoy a day out with family and friends, but described the two men's behaviour as 'inconsiderate' Speaking on the incident a spokesman for British Naturism called the police threats 'absolutely monstrous'. Andrew Welch, the volunteer organisation's national spokesman, said: 'The law is very clear that being naked in public is not a crime.' 'It has to be proved by a complainant that the nude person intended to cause somebody alarm or distress.' He added that going on the beach naked, 'simply because you would like to have an all over tan' is 'definitely not illegal'. Mr Welch said that it is 'absolutely monstrous' that the pair might be put on the sex offenders' register, calling the threat 'almost medieval and pointing out that if they were added it could 'harm their whole careers'. Commenting on the police's point that there were children present, Mr Welch said: 'There is no evidence anywhere of any harm to children at the mere sight of adult nudity,' adding that it can in fact benefit children. The incident took place last week, when parts of Northern Ireland saw temperatures soar to more than 27C.","Two men were caught skinny dipping in Belfast Lough, County Down .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Rising from her seat, hands punching the air above her head, German Chancellor Angela Merkel roared as her team thrashed Portugal 4-0 in their opening World Cup match earlier this month. Since then Mrs Merkel, a leader already widely approved of in the polls, has enjoyed an upsurge in popularity - with some surveys suggesting spikes in support for her as the team progressed through the tournament. And her reaction to Germany's win in the World Cup final on Sunday - which saw her celebrating in the dressing room with the victorious team - secured her place in the hearts of the nation. Changing faces: Angela Merkel, pictured left to right from top left, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2003, 2004 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 . Her recent . boost in the polls has been further bolstered by her tough stance . against allegations of U.S. agents spying on Germany. Last week, she expelled the CIA's Berlin chief - the move came a day after Berlin police searched the home and office of a German military intelligence official alleged to have been spying for America. The U.S. official was told to leave the country in a public signal of Angela Merkel’s fury over US spying on Germany which in the past has included repeated snooping on her own mobile phone. Her firm action in response to the alleged cases of spying - an issue which once saw Germans questioning her authority - has been met with public support. Mrs Merkel, fondly nicknamed 'Mutti' or 'mother, is enjoying an all-time peak in her approval ratings. But this weekend rumours emerged that the German Chancellor, who celebrates her 60th birthday on Thursday, might step down from her post before the next election - which is due to be held in 2017. Warm welcome: Angela Merkel shakes hands with Croatian President Ivo Josipovic as Slovenian President Borut Pahor looks on before a meeting in Croatia today of south-eastern European leaders . Respected leader: Mrs Merkel with Slovenian President Borut Pahor, left, and Croatian President Ivo Josipovic, right. The German Chancellor's approval rating is at an all-time high . In an article published in Germany's Der . Spiegel, which is usually well-informed on German politics, cabinet members and senior politicians were quoted confirming . the possibility. The German magazine said Merkel was interested in the role of European Council President, or the Secretary-General of the United Nations, both of which will be available in 2017. But Merkel's spokesman and party colleagues have denied speculation about how long she would stay in office, with one saying she would be the 'least likely' of all of Europe's leaders to step down early. Football fan: Mrs Merkel, who was nicknamed the German team's 'lucky charm', stands next to German President Joachim Guack as they celebrate the World Cup win with the players and coach Joachim Loew, right . Time for a selfie: Mrs Merkel was happy to pose with players including Lukas Podolski, pictured, after Germany beat Argentina in the World Cup final. She publicly supported the team throughout the tournament . Thrilled: Mrs Merkel and German President Joachim Gauk roar as Germany score the winning goal in the World Cup final. The Chancellor later joined players in the dressing room after the game . Passionate supporter: Mrs Merkel hugs Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association (centre) and IOC President Thomas Bach, after Germany wins the World Cup final against Argentina on Sunday . If Merkel did step down, she would be the first German Chancellor to do so since 1949. Such a move would come as a major shock in Germany, where has been in power for almost nine years, and be felt across Europe, where her position as the continent's most powerful leader is undisputed. Mrs Merkel grew up in a rural area outside Berlin in the communist east, and showed a great talent for maths, science and languages. 1954: Born Hamburg . 1978: Earns physics doctorate . 1990: Joins CDU . 1994: Becomes minister for environment . 2000: Becomes CDU leader . 2005: Becomes chancellor . 2009: Re-elected chancellor . 2013: Re-elected chancellor for second time . She earned a doctorate in physics but later worked as a chemist at a scientific academy in East Berlin. She had never been involved in politics but, at the age of 36, she joined the burgeoning democracy movement in 1989 and, after the Berlin Wall came down, she got a job as government spokeswoman following the first democratic elections. She joined the CDU, the party she now leads, two months before the reunification of Germany and within three months she was in the Kohl cabinet as minister for women and youth. She quickly established herself in the party, rising through the ranks until she was chosen to lead it in 2000 and was elected Germany's first female chancellor in 2005. The Chancellor received a ringing endorsement from voters in last year's . elections, when she promised to serve a full term, winning 311 seats . for the CDU party and a bigger share of the vote than in 200. Now Forbes magazine ranks Mrs Merkel as the second most powerful person in the world - the highest position ever held by a woman. If Mrs Merkel does resign as German chancellor, her successor is widely expected to be Ursula von der Leyen, the first woman to serve as German defence minister. When Mrs Merkel appointed her last year it was seen as the anointing of her eventual successor, but Ms von der Leyen has been a controversial choice, both criticised and ridiculed for introducing army crèches and flexible working hours to make the military more appealing as a career.","The German Chancellor's approval ratings are at an all-time high .

"By . Snejana Farberov . The jury panel in the murder trial of a 20-year-old Florida college student accused of strangling to death his romantic rival was shown today grisly images of the suspect’s blood-spattered SUV, which prosecutors believe served as the crime scene. Pedro Bravo is charged with murdering Christian Aguilar, 18, a University of Florida student, and dumping his body in the woods in September 2012 as part of a plot to reunite with his high school girlfriend, who was dating the victim. On Friday, prosecutors put up on the screen in court images showing the interior of Bravo's blue Chevy Blazer smeared with blood. Graphic scene: On Day 5 of the Pedro Bravo murder trial, prosecutors showed the jury the blood-stained interior of the defendant's Chevy Blazer believed to be the scene of Christian Aguilar's killing . Crime scene technicians who examined the SUV back in 2012 discovered scrapes on the ceiling and a cracked windshield along with blood stains. Also today the court heard from forensic documenting expert Thomas Vastrick, who examined Bravo's journals containing hate-filled writings about Aguilar and love letters inspired by Erika Friman, his former girlfriend. The handwritten diary included a suicide note penned by the Santa Fe College student. Victim: Bravo is also on trial for kidnapping and other charges in the September 20, 2012, death of Christian Aguilar (pictured), who once was his high school friend . Next to . take the stand on Day 5 of the trial was Timothy Peck, an officer with . the University of Florida Police Department who was the first law . enforcement official to encounter Bravo, Local10 reported. Peck . testified that the then-18-year-old man walked into a police station on . his own to report Aguilar, his high school friend, missing. ‘He was very cooperative and very wanting to assist in helping to find him,’ Peck recalled. But . according to the campus cop, he sensed that something was amiss because . Bravo allegedly offered conflicting versions of what went on between . him and Aguilar. Initially, . the suspect admitted to getting into a verbal argument with the . 18-year-old UF student, but he later changed his story, saying that the . two came to blows. After the interview, Peck called Aguilar's father in Miami and expressed concern that Bravo may have done something to his son. Aguilar's remains were eventually found by two hunters, James Rains and Jesse Everidge, out looking for jasmine vines in a pine forest in Levy County. Rains and Everidge took the stand Friday describing the moment they came upon Aguilar's skull lying face down in a small clearing, Gainesville.com reported. The hunters told the court that initially they smelled something putrid and followed the scent to the burial site. 'Something caught my nose,' Everidge said. 'We found what we smelled. What caught my eye as strange was the roundness of the bone that I could see.' On . Thursday, prosecutors presented in court more graphic evidence, . including a weaved belt they said Bravo had used to throttle his rival. Jurors . also got to see a photo of a shovel that was found under a deck outside . of Bravo's apartment building in Spyglass, which officials said he used . to bury Aguilar's body in a remote field. Prosecutors believe that the 20-year-old defendant strangled his former friend-turned-rival inside his vehicle after giving him Gatorade laced with a mixture of drugs during a shopping trip September 20, 2012.

Thomas talks to a grinning Pedro Bravo during Day 5 of his trial Friday . On Wednesday, the court heard the second part of the testimony of Aguilar's girlfriend, Erika Friman, who detailed her relationship with the two men. The three of them had been friends in high school. After Friman entered college, she began dating Aguilar but kept it a secret from Bravo, WWGP reported. ‘I lied to him because he was at a . very sensitive point in his life, I supposed,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want . to throw him over the edge and say, “By the way, I’m dating a mutual . friend of ours.”’ 'Murder . weapon': Prosecutors in the trial of Pedro Bravo, accused of killing . his romantic rival Christian Aguilar, showed jurors this image of a . weaved belt they believe the defendant used to strangle the 18-year-old . to death . Clue: . Police believe that Bravo used this shovel found under a deck near his . apartment building to bury Aguilar's body in a field . Grisly evidence: Gainesville Police Crime Scene . Investigator Mark Trahan points to blood on a shoe insert (left) and the . bottom of a Rust-Oleum paint can (right) that were found in a backseat . compartment during a search of Pedro Bravo's Chevy Blazer . Caught on camera: In this Sept. 16, 2012 video from a Wal-Mart surveillance camera, Pedro Bravo leaves the store with a shovel he purchased at a Lowe's store, as the video is shown to the jury Thursday . When Bravo, . a student at Santa Fe College, found out about his friends' budding . romance, police said he became obsessed with the idea of eliminating . Aguilar so he could be with Friman. Friman told the court that she arranged a meeting between the two men after Bravo threatened to kill himself. ‘I cared about anyone who claimed they were suicidal,’ she told the court. As part of her testimony, Friman also read entries from Bravo's journal. ‘No . one will stop me,’ the suspected killer wrote. ‘I will get out of Miami . and into Gainesville by January 2013 and I will get her back.’ Emotional: Ms Friman detailed for the court Wednesday how she started dating Aguilar in college but decided not to tell Bravo about it to spare his feelings . Prosecutors say on September 21, 2012, Pedro Bravo spent 13 minutes strangling Christian Aguilar in a Wal-Mart parking lot before burying the body. Aguilar's skeletal remains were discovered in October 2012 - several weeks after his murder - by hunters in forest off State Road 24 near Cedar Key in Levy County. On Tuesday, Kramer showed a photo of Bravo and Aguilar as high school pals in Miami and surveillance photos of them buying a Kanye West CD at Best Buy in Gainesville, according to Gainsville.com. But he also showed gruesome pictures of Aguilar's remains to the courtroom, and Bravo didn't react. Object of affection: Bravo had become obsessed that Aguilar, a University of Florida student, was dating his high school girlfriend, Erika Friman, pictured, and plotted to eliminate him, Assistant State Attorney Brian Kramer said . Other surveillance pictures showed Bravo buying a shovel, drugs, duct tape, a knife and other items from Lowe's and Wal-Mart that were used in the alleged killing. The prosecution's case leans on Bravo's journal and sketchbook, in which he detailed his bubbling resentment regarding his and Friman's break up and the fact she had began to date Aguilar. 'His plan is to get her back,' Kramer said of Bravo. 'He's got to reunite with Erika.' In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the Internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar to his car and then suffocated him using possibly a belt around his neck in the back seat. Death: In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar, pictured, to his car and strangled him .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Over-dependent? The survey of children across Europe found that many in the UK had a constant urge to check their phones, with some even sacrificing family time to go online . Almost two thirds of British nine to 16-year-olds admit problematic use of their smartphone, including an over-dependence on their mobiles, a new study has found. The survey of children across Europe found that many in the UK had a constant urge to check their phones, with some even sacrificing family time to go online. Others said they had missed out of sleeping or eating because of their internet use, with more British children reporting issues with their smartphone use than their European counterparts. The Net Children Go Mobile study is produced by the EU Kids . Online research programme at LSE university and looks at the internet . habits of children across 25 EU countries. Although the report found that British children have embraced the smartphone more . than children in other countries surveyed, researchers found that with their increased usage came a greater . number of issues. Some 65 per cent of the children surveyed said they had experienced at least two forms of excessive use, compared with 57 per cent in Portugal, 50 per cent in Italy and only 34 per cent in Belgium. Most notable was the two-thirds of children who said they had a strong need to keep checking theirphone for anything new, while almost half feel bothered when they cannot check it. A similar number said they had checked their devices in places where they should not have. 'When it’s in the night, I’ll go under the covers and start playing games or looking at my pictures to delete, things like that,' said one nine-year-old young respondent, Angela. Children reported that the main benefit of having a smartphone was feeling more connected to their friends, although one in three said they felt they must always be available for contact, either via text message, social media or services such as WhatsApp. One 12-year-old, Emma, said: 'It's worse on WhatsApp, I say, because there are groups, and then say I went for dinner there’d be like 100 messages and you just can’t be bothered to read them, and then you miss something.' Lifeline: Researchers reported finding that children and adolescents viewed their phones as ¿extensions¿ of their body, that can carried around with them throughout the day . One-quarter . of children say they miss eating or sleeping because of their use of . the internet, and nearly two-thirds say that the internet gets in the . way of time they should spend with family, friends or schoolwork – a . higher figure than for others in Europe. Researchers reported finding that children and adolescents viewed their phones as ‘extensions’ of their body, that can carried around with them throughout the day. Older teenagers, particularly boys, were more likely to report problematic behaviour, although some almost a third of children aged nine and ten said they worried about excessive use. The report writers concluded: 'The UK still leads in terms of measures of excessive internet use, although the rest of Europe appears to be ‘catching up’ in this regard. 'Say I went for dinner there’d be like 100 messages and you just can’t be bothered to read them, and then you miss something' Emma, 12 . 'Still, UK children are increasingly reporting the negative consequences of excessive internet useover time. 'While . UK children embrace smartphones more, and are more positive about their . benefits (especially for keeping in touch with friends), smartphones . clearly have their downsides too; forexample, a third of children felt the pressure to be available for contact through these devices, andmore children in the UK than across Europe are also now reporting a range of negative consequences.' Sonia Livingstone, one of the report's . authors, that childrens' constant internet use made them unable to escape bullies. In 2013, 21 per cent of children in Britain aged nine to 16 had been bullied, with more girls than boys reporting being picked on. For the first time, more youths said they were cyber bullied (12 per cent) than picked on face to face (9 per cent ), with social networking sites such as Facebook being the most common forum for online taunts. There has also been a sharp spike in the . number of youngsters who are exposed to hate messages, self-harm and . pro-anorexia websites, according to the research. 'Bullying is happening both ways,' said Professor Livingstone. 'It is happening at school and when they go home they are on Facebook and targeted. It is really hard to escape. That is the new phenomenon. Kids are on their Facebook 24/7. Risk: For the first time, more youths said they were cyber bullied than picked on face to face with social networking sites being the most common forum for online taunts . 'There is research that shows that if cyber bullying is anonymous then it is easier to lash out at others. And on the internet, people might think they are just having a bit of a laugh, but you can't see how the person on the other side is really feeling and responding. 'The internet is so fast, so bullying messages and images that are put out there can spread so quickly it is hard to contain them and it can escalate.' She said the internet 'can be part of the solution' and called on teachers and parents to better educate young people to the dangers of the web. Shaun Kelly, head of safeguarding at Action for Children, said: 'Young people's increasing exposure to negative user-generated content, such as bullying via social media or sites about self-harming, is a sobering reminder of the potential risks to children online. 'Increased smartphone and tablet usage means parents and teachers cannot always supervise young people's activity, however talking to young people about internet use can effectively build resilience and protect against potentially damaging or disturbing content. 'Adults must show an interest in all aspects of young people's online activities, not just when they are concerned.'","Net Children Go Mobile report questioned children in 25 countries .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A precious hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins has been discovered in a cave where they have lain undisturbed for more than 2,000 years. The treasure trove was initially unearthed by a member of the public, who stumbled across four coins in the cavern in Dovedale in the Peak District, sparking a full-scale excavation of the site. Experts say the find is highly unusual as it is the first time coins from these two separate civilisations have been buried together. The hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins which were discovered in the Reynard's Cave and Kitchen cavern in Dovedale in the Peak District where they have lain undisturbed for more than 2,000 years . And the setting itself adds to the mystery surrounding the discovery, as while Roman coins have often been found in fields, this is understood to be the first time they have been unearthed in a cave. Archaeologists discovered 26 coins, including three Roman coins which pre-date the invasion of Britain in AD43, and 20 other gold and silver pieces which are Late Iron Age and thought to belong to the Corieltavi tribe. National Trust archaeologist Rachael Hall said whoever owned the cache, which has been declared as ‘treasure’ by the authorities, was probably a wealthy and influential figure. She said: ‘The coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them. There's gold in them thar hills: One of the Late Iron Age gold coins discovered in Dovedale, Peak District . ‘Coins were used more as a symbol of power and status during the Late Iron Age, rather than for buying and selling staple foods and supplies. Was an individual simply hiding his ‘best stuff’ for safe keeping? Or, perhaps speculating, in the hope that the value would increase in the future, like a modern-day ISA? ‘The situation of the cave can’t be ignored either. Could it have been a sacred place to the Late Iron Age peoples that was taboo to enter in everyday life, making it a safe place that would ensure that person’s valuables were protected?’ The largest hoard of Iron Age gold and silver coins ever found in Britain was discovered by an amateur archaeologist in 2000 near Hallaton in south east Leicestershire. More than 5,000 coins and, jewellery and a silver-gilt Roman parade helmet were among the treasures discovered during that excavation. Coins and a Roman Aesica brooch that were initially unearthed by a member of the public . Ian Leins, the British Museum’s curator of Iron Age and Roman coins, said that while this latest find at Reynard’s Cave and Kitchen does not quite match the Hallaton discovery, it is ‘exciting’. He said: ‘Although this is a much smaller hoard than the similar finds made at Hallaton in 2000, this has been declared treasure and is an exciting discovery given the puzzling location in a cave and the fact that it lies beyond the main circulation area of the coinage.’ The project was also unusual because, for the first time, the National Trust enlisted the help of wounded ex-soldiers returning from Afghanistan to assist with the excavation. The Defence Archaeology Group’s Operation Nightingale project provides recuperation through field archaeology for service personnel injured in ton the frontline. Joanne Richardson, who spent 10 years in the military and was part of the excavation team, said: ‘This was the first archaeological excavation I’ve ever taken part in and it was brilliant. ‘I was working at the back of the cave, in the dark, and I was the first person to find a coin - a silver coin. ‘It was so exciting and really helped to lift spirits, after several fruitless days of hard graft. My first dig and this is what I found. The experience working alongside archaeologists and other veterans was inspiring.’ National Trust archaeologist Rachael Hall said whoever owned the cache, which has been declared as ;treasure' by the authorities, was probably a wealthy and influential figure . Operation Nightingale’s Sergeant Diarmaid Walshe added: ‘With the inherent skills of the soldier - an appreciation of landscape, topography and deposits in the ground - archaeology is a discipline that is perfect for service personnel. ‘Through projects like the excavation at Dovedale, archaeology can help former service personnel to address their ailments and help in their recovery.’ The Corieltavi tribe was made up of a number of other small clans who would come together for the common good. The coins have been cleaned by conservation specialists at the British Museum and University College London and will go on permanent display at Buxton Museum later this year.","Four coins found by member of the public sparked full-scale search .

"By . Sam Webb . Fraudster: Ketan Somaia gave the impression he was a successful millionaire by treating a wealthy investor to luxury trips and gifts . A business tycoon who fleeced wealthy investors out of £13.5million was jailed for eight years today after the largest ever private prosecution in English legal history. Ketan Somaia, 52, wooed his victims with luxury trips on private Learjets, champagne parties, extravagant dinners and expenses paid trips to Dubai, Kenya and South Africa. The Kenyan businessman, dubbed ‘King Con’, boasted about his connections to the billionaire Hinduja brothers while showing off his plush office in Mayfair and a palatial home in the exclusive north London suburb of Hadley Wood. In reality Somaia was shamelessly exploiting his unwitting victims to get his hands on their money to sustain his luxurious lifestyle and prop up his failing businesses. Even after his arrest Somaia continued to live in a manner that ‘most can only dream of’, dining at the five-star Dorchester hotel in Mayfair and the exclusive East India Men’s Club, and sending his teenage daughter to a finishing school in Switzerland. Somaia was convicted of nine counts of fraud after a private prosecution launched by his victim and former friend Murli Mirchandani at the Old Bailey. Mr Mirchandani lost nearly $20million between 1999 and 2000 while a second investor Dilip Shah lost 200,000 dollars. Sentencing Somaia, Judge Richard Hone QC said: ‘Your fraudulent conduct involved obtaining $19.7million. At the prevailing exchange rates that represents approximately £13.5million. ‘It is apparent from the evidence that your Dolphin Group of companies was in serious trouble at the time of the economic downturn at the end of 1999. ‘I am satisfied the money you took as loans and investments were never invested as you said they would be but were used by you either for your own purposes or to prop up your failing companies. ‘You were fundamentally dishonest in your dealings with both Murli Mirchandani and Dilip Shah. You breached their trust in you in a callous, immoral and flagrant manner. Influence: All four of the billionaire Hinduja brothers who Ketan Somaia, dubbed King Con, claimed to know . ‘But for your admitted ill health I would have had no hesitation in passing a sentence of ten years imprisonment. However I think some allowance should be made though in my judgement you are your own worst enemy in that respect, having failed to take medication and failed to adhere to your doctor’s advice.’ Defence barrister James Woods QC had attempted to delay sentence again after arguing Somaia needed another operation. Mr Woods also claimed that Somaia had only a 20 per cent chance of surviving the next five years because of his heart and kidney problems. Somaia was able to pull off the scams because his victims accepted his personal guarantees that ‘my word is my bond’. He gave the impression of being a successful businessman with his smooth, charming, impressive and persuasive exterior. Somaia bragged that he was a friend of the billionaire Hinduja brothers and owned assets worth $500million in banking and hotels. Exclusive: Hadley Wood in north London where Ketan Somaia owned a palatial home (file picture) He could boast a link to Lord Parkinson through Dolphin Holdings, part of a business empire built up by Somaia that collapsed in 2001. Mr Mirchandani heard of his business prowess at a cocktail party and was quickly bewitched by Somaia’s offer of a lucrative partnership. Somaia treated him to dinners at Annabel’s nightclub in London and all expenses paid trips to South Africa and Dubai and flaunted his lavish home in Hadley Wood, north London. His scam began with a plea for a short term loan of $865,000 to buy shares in Delphis Bank Mauritius, guaranteeing repayment in four months. Two days later he convinced Mr Mirchandani to hand over $7.5million to buy a ten per cent stake in the bank. In July Mr Mirchandani transferred another $2.5million to buy a stake in another company which Somaia claimed would double in value within three years. The following month Mr Mirchandani thought he was paying $2.775million for a 50 per cent interest in the Diamond Mining Corporation of Liberia, which Somaia claimed would treble in value within nine months. Two weeks later Mr Mirchandani transferred another $3million to Somaia to help purchase a bank in Tanzania with a guaranteed profit of 20 per cent and full repayment within 120 days at 15 per cent interest. Somaia built up a feeling of ‘fevered excitement’ in his victim with false opportunities of being his business partner, said prosecutor William Boyce QC. Justice: Somaia was convicted of nine counts after a trial at the Old Bailey . In October 1999 Somaia invited Mr Mirchandani to a meeting at his office in Brook Street, Mayfair and offered him the chance to invest in a hotel group in South Africa. Mr Mirchandani paid $1.85million for a 50 per cent interest in the deal but never received any paper work confirming his investment. The duped businessman became increasingly worried about his investments after Somaia asked for two loans of £1million at 15 per cent interest and $1.5million at 18 per cent interest in November 1999. Somaia claimed he was having ‘cash flow problems’ but would personally guarantee the loans.The following month he invited Mr Mirchandani on another ‘no expenses spared’ trip to South Africa in December. By March 2000 Mr Mirchandani was pressing Somaia for repayment but still felt some obligation because of Somaia’s previous generosity. Victim Murli Mirchandani leaving the Old Bailey after giving evidence during the trial in June. He lost nearly $20million between 1999 and 2000 . As a result he agreed to give the conman a further loan of £1million to be repaid within 30 days. He never received the money back but two months later Somaia again asked for another loan during a trip to Mauritius. Mr Mirchandani agreed to give him another $1million on condition everything was repaid by September 2000 before finally pulling the plug. Somaia then asked Dilip Shah for ‘emergency funding’ with an return of 25 per cent but Mr Shah could only afford $200,000. In return he was given ten million shares in Delphis Bank Mauritius but when he tried to cash them in a year later he was told they were worthless. Mr Mirchandani - who himself claims to be worth more than $120million - finally launched a private prosecution in the autumn of 2011 while Somaia was in London. Somaia claimed in his defence that Mr Mirchandani gave him the money knowing the risk it might be lost, and said the gamble had not paid off. The court heard Somaia also received around $2million from Surajit Sen in 1997 and owed a total of $15million to another businessman, referred to as ‘Mr Bose’, by April 2001. Somaia made the first repayment of $2million to Mr Bose but failed to pay any more of the money back. Somaia, of Bayswater, west London, was found guilty of eight charges of obtaining money transfers by deception from Mr Mirchandani between 23 June 1999 and 6 May 2000 and one charge of obtaining money transfers by deception from Mr Shah on 10 August 2000. He was acquitted of two counts of obtaining money by deception from Mr Mirchandani amounting to $3.5m. In a statement released following conviction, Mr Mirchandani said: ‘I feel great relief that Mr Somaia has finally been brought to justice. ‘Fourteen years ago, I was a self-made businessman with a thriving business to hand over to my children. When I met Mr Somaia, I trusted him implicitly. ‘He seemed to me to be a very successful and wealthy businessman and I thought that I could benefit from doing business with him. I now bitterly regret my misplaced trust. He has stolen US$19.5 million from me which has caused considerable harm to my business. ‘His actions have undermined my trust in people and had a detrimental effect on my health. I have spent the last fourteen years trying to rebuild my businesses at the same time as trying to hold Mr Somaia to account for his actions. ‘By bringing a private prosecution, I have made sure that his conduct is seen for what it is: criminal and dishonest. Securing a conviction against Mr Somaia will not undo the harm he has caused and the pain he has inflicted upon me and my family but knowing that he has been brought to justice helps bring us some closure.’ Michael O’Kane, Head of Business Crime at legal firm Peters & Peters said: ’Mr Murli Mirchandani approached Peters & Peters in 2009 with a view to bringing Mr Somaia to justice. ‘Peters & Peters helped Mr Mirchandani to mount his own private prosecution which is, to our knowledge, the largest private prosecution brought by an individual in the UK to date.’","Ketan Somaia wooed victims with luxury trips and Champagne parties .

"By . Gemma Mullin . It is often hailed as an indulgence or a pick-me-up for many people but chocolate proved to be an important necessity during the First World War. For the brave men in the trenches the confectionary gave soldiers a taste of home, boosting morale while away from friends and family. To mark its significance a unique exhibition has been unwrapped at York’s Chocolate Story, North Yorkshire, where visitors will be able to see previously unseen artefacts, footage, photographs and letters. A chocolate box sent from the Lord Mayor of York to all soldiers on the front line for Christmas 1914 features in the exhibition at York's Chocolate Story in York . WWI: A Taste of Home exhibition shows photographs of soldiers crossing Lendal Bridge in York getting ready to leave the city ahead of the First World War in 1914 . A letter from Dr H. Moore is among those to the Lord Mayor in thanks for the box of chocolates sent to all York soldiers fighting the First World War. He writes he will 'treasure the box' for as long as he lives and also tells how he was wounded in the early days of the war in the retreat from Mons and was blinded in his left eye . The artefacts featured in the exhibition entitled ‘WWI: A Taste of Home’, which also commemorates the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, include a set of military chocolate tins with one of the very few remaining Lord Mayor’s chocolate tins issued to all citizens of York in active service at Christmas 1914. This gesture, on behalf of the city’s population, started ‘Chocolate Letters’, which is a series of over 250 thank you letters penned by York servicemen in training, in trenches, in prisoner of war camps and at sea. One of the letter’s, from soldier Gunner Henry Bailey from Holgate, York, dated January 11, 1915, said: ‘I feel that I ought to send my very best thanks for the nice box of chocolate I received so unexpectedly. ‘I am proud to be able to say that I am a York lad and am looking forward to a speedy termination of this Cruel War. I shall prize the box as long as God spares me.’ A sealed letter to the Mayor of York from Major Clark, which thanks him for the chocolate box he received at Christmas time, which is on display at the exhibition . The exhibition holds artefacts such as the Rowntree's Elect Cocoa tin (left) which was used in the war and a Rowntree's advert from the cocoa from 1916 (right) A postcard of the remaining staff at the Rowntree's Factory in York, which was sent to all employees who had been sent to fight on the frontline during the First World War . An unnamed Rowntree's employee who was sent to the frontline (left) and a chocolate cross memorial to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of war (right) A letter to Mr Heppell from the director of Rowntree's expressing his sympathy following the death of his son during the war and describing him as 'one of the best lads we ever had in the place' A series of over 250 'Chocolate Letters', which are thank you letters penned by York servicemen in training, trenches, prisoner of war camps and at sea are on display . A chocolate box sent to all soldiers in the war was used by its owner to store bullet shells and shards, as well as a sketch of a Mill's grenade after eating the chocolate . These letters speak of humour, pride and even fear, offering a poignant insight into how chocolate functioned as a symbol of a life they had left behind. ‘Throughout history cocoa has proved a valuable resource in times of war, dating back to the warrior Aztecs who drank bitter cocoa to gain strength and energy,” said a spokesperson for the venue. ‘Visitors can explore how the gift of chocolate helped to keep wartime spirits high, both at home and on the frontline, investigate how the city’s famous Quaker chocolate companies offered their support to the war effort and how chocolate manufacturing changed forever after 1918.’ Visitors will also be able to listen to never before exhibited voice recordings, which details the background and experiences of York servicemen who survived the war as well as precious film footage of the Yorkshire regiments. The exhibition will run until December 31.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Kate Fisher is so besotted with her dog Rupert that she has taken a photograph of him every day for a year. In addition Miss Fisher, 54, has blogged about how Rupert, three, changed from a shy and fearful rescue puppy to a friendly and confident canine. The dog blog started in March last year three months after Rupert arrived at Miss Fisher's home in Bookham, Surrey, from a violent and uncertain life in Romania. Rupert, Rupert the dog: Everyone knows his name since he arrived from Romania . When Rupert arrived from Romania, he was shy and fearful. Now he is a loving dog who enjoys his life . The German wirehaired pointer cross has since become a hit with 20,000 views on the online photo sharing journal Blipfoto from as far wide as Australia and New Zealand. Mother-of-one Miss Fisher said: ‘The project didn't start as a way of showing Rupert's journey but the way he has flourished whilst being here in Surrey has just been phenomenal. ‘When Rupert first came over he was scared of cars and had not seen horses or sheep and was always wondering if they were going to hurt him. Not content with being an internet sensation, Rupert has now been captured on canvas . ‘That was the best thing about photographing him every day for a year - seeing the change and progression of him. ‘It is his personal story captured on camera.’ Rupert the dog came to England in a van with around 30 other dogs from Romania, saved by a charity based in the country. Amateur photographer Miss Fisher said: ‘He came to us as a very nervous and naive dog and the journal tells the story of his growing trust in the human race after a very bad start and his joy at finding a home surrounded by beautiful countryside that he can explore. ‘I was actually looking through a magazine and there was an article about new websites, one of which was Blipfoto, which is a social media site where you upload a picture a day, so I gave it a go. ‘I basically signed up to it because I wanted to better my photography skills but am quite a private person so did not want my own life out on display. One woman and her dog: Kate Fisher with Rupert (centre) and her 13-year-old son Joe . ‘It has certainly helped me understand the camera more by using different modes and I am able to capture different types of picture now too.’ Miss Fisher has not carried on with Rupert's daily journal since it finished but has been inundated with requests to continue it. She added: ‘I wanted to take a rest from uploading pictures but I get people from America, New Zealand, France and wherever else asking for updates on Rupert, so I am going to put one up every now and again.’ Game boy: Rupert loves posing for photographs (left), almost as much as he likes skittles (right) Anyone for tennis?

"By . Paul Donnelley . A man who murdered his fiancée with a single punch during an argument over whether to take a bus or a taxi home was jailed for life today. Former soldier Ryan Ingham, 26, sent Caroline Finegan, 29, crumpling to the ground like a ‘bag of potatoes’ after he ran at her at full pelt before striking her in the face. One witness was ‘moved to tears’ after seeing Ingham hit her ‘like a car travelling at 40mph’ before he started to shake her ‘like a rag doll’ as she lay on the ground in an act of ‘wanton thuggery’. Killer: Ryan Ingham, 26, has been convicted of murdering his fiancee, Caroline Finegan, 29 . The force . of the punch broke Miss Finegan’s nose, her eye socket and swivelled her . head so violently that it tore blood vessels in her neck. During . a 999 call as bingo hall worker Miss Finegan lay dying, Ingham was . heard telling her: ‘Hello, wakey wakey. Oi, monkey get up, look you . bashed your head. What you doing, your belly is showing.’ When . paramedics arrived at the scene near Shudehill bus station in . Manchester city centre at around 1am on January 16, Miss Finegan was not . breathing. She was pronounced dead later that day in hospital. Scene: The couple had been on a night out in Manchester city centre before they rowed, the court heard . Today . at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester Ingham who was convicted of . murder after a trial showed no emotion as he was ordered to serve a . minimum 16 years before he could be considered for parole. It emerged he . had a string of previous convictions for assaults on ex-girlfriends. Judge . Peter Lakin told him: ‘You are an unpleasant coward and young man with a . complete inability to control your temper particularly after the . consumption of alcohol. You have in any view a very disturbing history . for assaulting your partners and clearly you have no respect what so . ever for the welfare of those who trust you in a relationship. ‘You . repaid Caroline’s love for you with a violent punch to her face which . caused immediate fatal brain haemorrhage. The reason you did this was . only because of a trivial argument over how to get home. With that . single punch you took away Caroline’s life. Tattooed thug: Father-of-six Ryan Ingham has a history of abuse towards his girlfriends and finally murdered one of them. He was sentenced to life imprisonment today with a recommendation he serve 16 years . ‘She . was only 29 and had her whole life ahead of her. She clearly thought . her relationship with you would bring future happiness. Sadly for her . she was completely wrong. You are a dangerous young man particularly . toward those in a relationship with you.’ Earlier . the court heard how Miss Finnegan who had five children from previous . relationships had met father-of-six Ingham in August last year and the . couple become engaged three months later. The incident took place in January after they had out together at Churchills pub in Manchester city centre. CCTV . captured the pair as they appeared to be arguing after leaving the pub . to make their way home to Stockport. The couple were seen initially . heading towards a bus station before speaking separately to a taxi . driver. Witness . Anthony O’Connor, a worker at Manchester Cathedral who had just left . work after a shift, said: ‘I saw a lady shouting very loudly and it . seemed directed at me and she was probably 40ft away. Then I noticed a . gentleman run straight past me on my left side. He was in the middle of . the road. He was running extremely fast. A witness reported seeing Ingham drag Miss Finegan by the arms onto the pavement after punching her . ‘He ran at her at a really full speed and then came into contact with her and with the punch she completely fell to the ground. ‘The . one thing that affects me that time and to this day is the way she fell . to the ground. The only way I can describe it is if you had a bag of . potatoes and if you drop them and they crumple. That is how she fell. As . far as I am aware the life left her instantly. She completely collapsed . into the road. He did not stop running and ran four or five steps . after. ‘I . could not see where the punch landed. I knew it was the upper part of . the body. He punched her while he was running. He ran, kept on running . and punched her. It was like someone hitting her in a motor car at about . 40mph. It was with incredible force he hit her with. He picked up great . speed. She was then on the floor. Heartbroken: Charlene Finegan (left) Caroline's cousin and Kath Gill (right) foster mother of Caroline outside court following the sentencing today . ‘He . came back and immediately picked her up by the arms and that scene was . horrific and it disturbed me. He dragged her onto the pavement and as he . was dragging her, her blouse was pulled up and her skirt was coming . down. ‘I . said to myself ‘What a way for a human being to go.’ There was total . disrespect for human life. It was horrendous. He started to shake her . like a rag doll. ‘I . think it was a total attack of thuggery. He had no respect of human . life and not respect for that girl. It was wanton thuggery. There is no . excuse for it.’ When . Ingham rang 999 he claimed he was qualified to carry out first aid on . the battlefield. When asked by the operator what caused the fall he . said: ‘I don’t know because we were arguing. ‘I . ran over to her and next thing I know she was being a mong, lying on . the floor, because we were about to get a taxi home. We were arguing . about getting a taxi home. It is superficial. I am ex-Army. I have got . my battlefield first aid.’ Ryan Ingham who spent six months in the Army has been in court a dozen times before for 23 offences, most linked to domestic violence. Here are the lowlights. 2005: Criminal assault - during course of argument with his 17-year-old girlfriend, he punched her in the face and body causing minor injury. August 2005: Same victim. Ingham elbowed her in the head during a domestic argument and received a suspended sentence. August 2008: Assaulted mother and father. 2012: Threatened girlfriend at the time with a knife to the neck and threatened her unborn child. October  2012: Before he became engaged to Caroline Finegan, there was incident where he hit her and she sustained a swollen cheek. ‘She . is in no danger. She is just p****d. I do not know if she is faking it . or not. She is all right because she is breathing normal. She is asleep. She is snoring. That is how I know she is asleep.’CT scans later . revealed extensive subarachnoid bleeding in Miss Finegan’s brain. At . 6.19pm on January 16 she was pronounced dead. Ingham . initially said she had passed out and fell over but later admitted they . had been ‘bickering’ about whether to get a bus or taxi home. He denied . murder. Senior . Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from Greater Manchester Police . (GMP) said after the case: ‘Caroline’s family have been left deeply . upset and cannot believe someone who claimed to love her could kill her. Ingham himself will have to live with the fact his reckless and . thoughtless action took the life of an innocent woman. ‘GMP . takes all reports of domestic abuse seriously. If you’re a friend, . family member or neighbour who witnesses signs of domestic abuse, report . it to the police. ‘Domestic . abuse is not acceptable under any circumstances and there are support . services available for victims and families from the report to . conviction.’ Sacha . Cooper, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service North . West, said: ‘Ryan Ingham carried out a horrific unprovoked attack on . his partner in the centre of Manchester after they had enjoyed a night . out together. ‘He . refused to take responsibility for his actions. Initially he fabricated . a version of events whereby she had fallen to the floor in a drunken . state and later on offered a plea to manslaughter. However, following a . trial, the jury convicted him of murder. ‘Today Ryan Ingham will face up to the consequences of his mindless actions as he begins his prison sentence.’","Father-of-six Ryan Ingham, 27, told he must serve at least 16 years .

"By . Paul Donnelley . President Vladimir Putin has called for an improvement in relations between Russia and the United States in an Independence Day message to Barack Obama, urging Washington to treat Moscow as an equal. The relationship between the two presidents and countries are at a low ebb following disagreements over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and over human rights, democracy and defence matters. ‘The head of the Russian state expressed hope that ... ties between the two countries will develop successfully on the basis of pragmatism and equality despite difficulties and disagreements,’ the Kremlin said in a statement, outlining a telegram sent to President Obama on the July 4 holiday. President Vladimir Putin called for an improvement in ties between Russia and the United States in an Independence Day message to Barack Obama . President Barack Obama arrives to speak at 1776, a hub for tech startups, in Washington DC . ‘Vladimir Putin also highlighted that Russia and the United States, as countries carrying exceptional responsibility for safeguarding international stability and security, should cooperate not only in the interests of their own nations but also the whole world.’ The telegram underlined a message President Putin has made central to his third term as president - that Russia, like the United States a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, must be treated as a world power and on an equal footing two decades after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin statement made no reference to sanctions imposed on Moscow by Washington after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in March, or to other differences between the two former Cold War enemies. But the call for ‘pragmatism and equality’ in relations suggested President Putin put the onus on President Obama to improve ties. The language was less upbeat than in last year's Independence Day telegram, in which President Putin expressed ‘certainty’ that Moscow and Washington would be able to work out solutions to various issues ‘regardless of the fact that not all approaches of the sides concur’. The telegram sent on July 4, 2012, at the height of the Syria conflict but long before the Ukraine crisis, was also more positive, referring to an improvement in preceding years and presenting an optimistic outlook for the future. Relations have deteriorated particularly since Russia annexed Crimea following the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovich as Ukrainian president. He had spurned a trade pact with the European Union in favour of better ties with Moscow. Russia accused the United States of supporting protests against President Putin before his re-election in 2012 and Washington has accused Moscow of suppression of his opponents and of gay rights. President Putin reiterated complaints this week the United States was trying to ‘contain’ Russia, using a term from the Cold War era. Other Russian officials have also taken a tough line this week, deflecting Western accusations that Moscow did not do enough to ensure pro-Russian separatists who have risen up in eastern Ukraine stuck to a ceasefire last week. ‘In fact, we are dealing with a new offensive type of weapon,’ Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Kommersant in a reference to the US sanctions, which impose visa bans and asset freezes on a number of Russian firms and officials. President Putin wants a better dialogue with America unlike his hardline predecessor Leonid Brezhnev (pictured) Another senior official goaded the United States by challenging its domination of world affairs.‘The hegemony of the US on the world stage is over,’ Yevgeny Lukyanov, the deputy head of the Russian Security Council comprising defence and security officials, told the RIA news agency. Personal relations between the two presidents appear cool as efforts continue to end the violence in east Ukraine. President Putin is now weighing whether to engage more with President Obama on Ukraine or risk more sanctions that could undermine Russia's economy, already on the verge of recession.","Relationship between the two presidents .

"By . James Slack . The identity of suspects arrested by the police should be publicised before they are charged, the Court of Appeal has ruled. In a hugely significant verdict, judges said the public understood that naming a person who had been arrested did not mean they were guilty. The judgment is a boost for freedom of information campaigners – who have been battling increasing police secrecy. A judge has ruled that names of suspects should be released as they are arrested and before they are charged . In the wake of the Leveson report, many forces have become reluctant to name people at the point of arrest – despite the fact that it can encourage witnesses to come forward. Yesterday’s ruling came in the case of a man who was arrested over allegations of child sex abuse. He was not subsequently charged but his identity was disclosed in open court during the trial of other men. Newspapers notified the man that, once the trial was over, they planned to report the fact that he had been arrested, along with other details. He objected, saying he would be ‘stigmatised as a suspected paedophile’, and applied for a privacy injunction. The request was rejected by Mr Justice Tugendhat last year and yesterday the Court of Appeal upheld that decision. The man’s lawyers had argued the public did not understand that suspects are ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and naming them breached their privacy. But Lady Justice Sharp said the principle of open justice must be upheld. She said: ‘Most members of the public understand the presumption of innocence and are able to distinguish between the position of someone who has been (merely) arrested, someone who has been charged, and someone who has been convicted of a criminal offence. The ruling at the Court of Appeal overturns guidance issued in the wake of the Leveson report which said the names of suspects should only be revealed 'in exceptional circumstances' ‘The fact of his arrest and other associated information has been extensively referred to in open court, including in public rulings given at criminal trials, and the respondents [the Press] want to report this.’ Historically, police forces have confirmed or denied a suspect has been arrested or interviewed under caution if asked by journalists. But this changed in the wake of the Leveson report into Press standards which said only in exceptional circumstances should the names of suspects be released. Naming suspects at the point of arrest has proved important in a string of cases. Further victims of both Stuart Hall and Rolf Harris came forward after their identities emerged. The man involved in yesterday’s case is appealing to the Supreme Court.","Ruling in case of man arrested during child sex inquiry but not charged .

"By . Gemma Mullin . The ticket wartime Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain used on his historic trip to broker a peace deal with Adolf Hitler has sold for almost £17,000. Chamberlain waved the ticket as he boarded the British Airways flight from Heston Aerodrome in London to Munich on September 29, 1938. The aim of the trip was to hold crisis talks following Germany’s invasion of Czechoslovakia and fearing . war, Chamberlain agreed to allow Hitler’s occupation of part of the . country in return for the assurance that peace and stability in Europe . would continue. It sold to a private collector at London auction house Spink and Son on Friday and is only the second time the ticket has been offered at auction. Scroll down for video . 'Peace in our time': The ticket Neville Chamberlain used to board a plane to Munich for a meeting with Hitler in 1938 is expected to fetch £15,000 at an auction later this month . Symbolic: The wartime leader waved the Anglo-German declaration on his return from the crisis talks. But just a year later he was forced to announce that Britain was at war following Germany's invasion of Poland . Neill Granger, a specialist at Spink, said: 'This plane ticket is quite exceptional. 'Neville Chamberlain’s visit to Munich in 1938 was an iconic moment in history. He thought he had solved the problem of Hitler and returned triumphant. 'But famously things didn’t turn out the way Chamberlain expected and a year later we were at war with Germany. 'What Chamberlain had intended to be a landmark moment ended up being one of the nails in his political coffin.' Mr Granger added: 'The flight ticket was issued on September 28, 1938, the day before the flight. 'It was found among the personal possessions of George Denny, one of the founders of British Airways. 'Normally these tickets were thrown away but he obviously decided this one was one to keep.' Historic: Chamberlain, pictured boarding the plane on September 29 1938,  met with the Fuhrer alongside Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier in a bid to secure peace in Europe . Support: A crowd of supporters and reporters gathered at the Heston Aerodrome to see the Prime Minister off . Farewell: Chamberlain embarks on the crucial journey to Germany . Along with Italian fascist leader Benito . Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier, Chamberlain and . Hitler signed a pact that became known as the Munich Agreement. On . his return to Britain the following day, Chamberlain triumphantly . declared that war had been averted and he had secured 'peace for our . time'. As . he waved the Anglo-German declaration above his head, he told reporters . waiting on the runway that the pact was 'symbolic of the desire of our . two peoples never to go to war with one another again.' But . just a year later he was forced to make the embarrassing announcement . that Britain was at war with Germany following Hitler’s continued . invasion of Poland. The . reaction set the grounds for Chamberlain’s political demise and by May . 1940 he had been replaced by Winston Churchill as Prime Minister. The paper ticket carried the number BA/WS 18249 and under 'passenger name' is written 'The Rt Hon Neville Chamberlain'. It notes that he left from Heston Aerodrome  and in the box marked 'Fare' it is written 'Special Flight'. After the flight it was saved by British Airways founder George Denny and was found among his possessions following his death. It is believed he kept the ticket as a souvenir as he would have appreciated the historic importance of the flight. The ticket was tipped to fetch £15,000 but the private collector bid further on the ticket and it fetched £16,800 at Friday's auction. In the spring of 1938, Hitler began openly to support the demands of German-speakers living in the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia for closer ties with Germany. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was intent on avoiding a war, despite the Czechoslovak government's hopes Britain and France would step in in the event of German invasion. Chamberlain flew to Germany twice in September 1938 to offer Hitler favourable agreements, but the Fuhrer kept upping his demands. On September 22, Hitler demanded the immediate cession of the Sudetenland to Germany and the evacuation of the Czechoslovak population by the end of the month. It seemed that war was imminent and Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, unprepared for the outbreak of hostilities, traveled to Munich, where they gave in to Hitler's demands on September 30. The prime minister signed a single page document with Hitler that he believed secured peace between Britain and Germany. Later that day, Chamberlain flew home to Britain, where he addressed a jubilant crowd in London and praised the Munich Pact for bringing 'peace in our time'. But the next day, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, and by March 1939, Hitler annexed the rest of Czechoslovakia, and the country ceased to exist. And despite Chamberlain's elation, a year later Britain declared war on Germany and the Second World War began on September 3, 1939.","Wartime Prime Minister waved the ticket before boarding a plane to Munich .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A pizza delivery driver who lives in a £220,000 four-bedroom house has been fined after he was judged to have the scruffiest back garden in his street. Neighbours became infuriated with Andrei Jonski, 48, and his wife Angi, who moved into their dream home in Driffield, East Yorkshire, eight years ago. Rubble, car parts, plastic sheeting, wood and old tyres soon built up in the back garden of the family home and a red Fiat Cinquecento appeared abandoned on the front lawn, a court heard. Neighbours complained about their view of his garden, which is full of rubble, tyres and plastic sheeting . After realising nothing had moved for months, especially when the couple took their two children on holiday to Poland in August 2013, a string of neighbours complained to East Riding of Yorkshire Council. Planning officers at the authority agreed it was not the 'amenity value' expected on a modern estate, with the amenity comprising of bedroom views from five houses which overlook the family’s back garden. The council planning department gave Mr Jonski six weeks to tidy up in June 2013 – or provide a valid reason not to. After ignoring their order six months later he was summoned to court for failing to comply with section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act, requiring him to maintain land. He was handed a criminal conviction by Bridlington Magistrates’ Court in March and appeared at Hull Crown Court last Thursday to appeal the decision. In his hearing Mr Jonski said he, rather than his wife, was solely responsible for the garden: ‘For me my garden is perfect. My wife does not like it, but I paid for this house and I paid for this garden. ‘It is a building site at the moment, but in a year’s time it will be the best garden in Driffield with a sauna and a Jacuzzi.’ He said his trouble began in 2010 when he fell out with his neighbours over building in his garden and the enforcement notice was their revenge. Pizza delivery driver Andrzei Jonski, 48, was fined over £3,000 for his untidy garden . He said first they complained about the size of his shed then they moved on to the state of his garden. He said they had put up decking to use their garden more and the complaints followed. Mr . Jonski said he had complained about their noise and flood water caused . by the decking into his garden, but was told by the council they were . civil matters. ‘My neighbours hate me,’ said Mr Jonski. ‘My neighbours complain. I am not . angry with the council officers, they are only doing their job. I can . only be angry for the hateful neighbours.’ He . said he accepted the frequent visits by the council officers to check . on him, and admitted he had put up a sign saying ‘No photography’ pointing to his neighbours over the back fence. He added: ‘I will soon be putting it back’. He . protested about the council officer’s visit to his wife, who is a . dentist, at work in Bridlington Hospital with the letter saying he, . rather than her, was responsible. He . said: ‘It is my private house. No one else can see it. Only Google can . see it from their satellite. I am not throwing away good stuff. I am . building a 2m deep pit for compressors in my shed.’ He . told the judge: ‘I am not a silly or stupid person. I did not receive . the letter so I did not comply with it. If I had received it, I would . not agree, but I would ask them what to do.’ Council . planning officer Jonathan Middleton, who drafted the enforcement notice . with the council’s legal department, said he had attended Mr Jonski's . property and told him of neighbours’ complaints, but on one occasion Mr . Jonski had appeared confrontational. He said they had acted on neighbours’ complaints in October 2012 and had given him repeated warning the . matters were being taken seriously. He . said the council had given Mr Jonski a list of things it wanted doing, . including the moving of rubble, car parts and metal into existing . buildings and the removal of the Fiat from the front lawn and six week . to do it. Mr Middleton told the hearing: 'In our view the state of the property was harming the amenity of the area'. ‘The neighbours had to look at children’s bikes, old broken tools, building materials, wheels, tyres, car parts and a vehicle trailer up against a wall. ‘A small red Fiat is parked on the lawn which was seen as they went past every day. It is an open plan estate, the car was next to the road and highly visible’. A red Fiat Cinquecento appeared abandoned on the front lawn of the four-bed house, Hull Crown Court heard . ‘Easingwood Way is a small cul-de-sac with five houses, all built tightly overlooking each other and all looked into each others gardens. ‘Each item on its own was not illegal, but the total effect could affect residential amenity. ‘We don’t serve notices on people who have temporarily parked a car on a lawn. Serving a notice is a last resort.’ Asked by the judge if Mr Jonski could have avoided complaint by pulling a huge tarpaulin over his lawn, Mr Middleton said if the council were to receive a complaint the tarpaulin was unsightly, and he viewed it was harming the local amenity, they would serve a notice. Recorder Abdul Iqbal, QC, said Mr Jonski had shown in court he could be confrontational and he was in no doubt council officers had served the correct notice on him. He said he had evidence of car parts, rubble, bikes tools and drums in the garden and of the neighbours’ concerns. ‘There is ample evidence the notices were served correctly on Mr Jonski,’ said Recorder Iqbal. ‘We accept the evidence Mr Middleton explained the situation to him through a number of visits.’ He said the appeal had failed and the magistrates’ fine of £2,299 still needed to be paid. He ordered a further £720 in costs for the Crown appeal hearing – totalling £3,019. Recorder Iqbal told Mr Jonski his claims to afford only £60 a week, from his part-time job as a delivery driver, was ridiculous: ‘You can’t live in a large house like this and afford a sauna and a Jacuzzi with an income of £60 a week. You will pay £150 a month. ‘If you don’t, there are consequences for you.’ Mr Jonski protested he wanted to appeal and be given a transcript of proceedings and he was ordered to be quiet or face leaving by the cells for being in contempt.","Andrei Jonski, 48, and wife Angi moved into the house eight years ago .

"By . Gemma Mullin . An 11-year-old girl was banned from a school trip because she had taken one day off to go to her mum’s funeral. Staff at St Giles’ Junior School in Bedworth, Warwickshire, told Maddie Stevens she couldn’t go on the trip to Frankie & Benny’s on Tuesday because she did not have 100 per cent attendance. The schoolgirl’s mother Gail Stevens died of breast cancer in January this year following a two year battle with the disease. Maddie Stevens, 11, who was not allowed to go on the '100 per cent attendance' trip, with her father Andy . Her father Andy Stevens, 48, a finance manager, did not find out about the her exclusion until Tuesday evening, which was after the trip had taken place and too late for him to appeal. He said: ‘It’s just so insensitive after everything she has been through. ‘Maddie has been absolutely amazing since her mum died. ‘She took only one day off to go the funeral, because we wanted to keep things as normal for her as we could. But even if she’d taken a week off I’d be saying this. Maddie's mother Gail had battled breast cancer for two years before she passed away in January this year . Maddie did not tell her father Andy (pictured on trip to London) about the trip until after it had happened . He added: ‘She got very upset when Gail passed away and at the funeral, but she’s just tried to get on with things. And after all that, she gets this kick in the face. ‘Her school should be celebrating what she’s achieved not saying “you can’t come on the school outing because your mum died”. ‘It’s not even about Frankie & Benny’s - my wife and I have said we’ll take her anytime - it’s the principle.’ Maddie said: ‘It made me feel sad not to be able to go because a few of my friends went. ‘It would have been a nice treat. Helping my mum out for the past two years has been hard.’ Gail, who was divorced from Mr Stevens, lived only a few streets away from her ex-husband and his current wife Deborah’s home Road in Exhall, Warwickshire. By Christmas last year Maddie was staying at her dad’s more often to get used to the transition she would soon have to make. Maddie pictured outside her school bus today, on her last day at St Giles' Junior School in Bedworth . Mr Stevens said: ‘In November, we were told it would be a matter of months before Gail would die. ‘We were really hoping it wouldn’t be at Christmas, and we tried to do our best for Maddie. ‘Gail’s birthday was on Boxing Day, so she was allowed out of Myton Hospice for that, but she was so sick she could hardly get off the settee. ‘When she went back in again after that, that was it - she didn’t come back out.’ Maddie’s very last Christmas present from her mother was the ice-skating lessons she had asked for. Since . her death, Maddie has dedicated herself to her skating, and has been . accepted into the Coventry Blaze’s Ice Hockey Academy. It is Maddie's last day at the junior school today and she is preparing to go into secondary school after the summer holidays. Mr Stevens said: ‘It’s a big moment, leaving your junior school and moving on to the somewhere new. ‘It’s obviously a time when Maddie’s mum would have been with her to help. ‘Instead, she’s being punished for going to her mum’s funeral. ‘When she told me about it she was really angry, but I don’t think she really wanted to talk about it. ‘So we’re doing our best to make sure it doesn’t affect her too much. ‘It just makes me furious that the school didn’t think twice about Maddie’s situation. ‘I got more and more angry each time I think about it, and I’m amazed they didn’t apologise to Maddie. It feels like they’re now punishing us for complaining about it.’ A spokesman from St Giles’ Junior School said: ‘Following concerns raised, the rewarding of pupils for 100 per cent attendance has been withdrawn.’ Pupils were taken to a Frankie & Benny's restaurant as a treat (pictured is the nearby Nuneaton branch) St Giles' Junior School in Bedworth, Warwickshire, where staff told Maddie Stevens she couldn't go on the trip because she did not have 100 per cent attendance. It was awarded a 'good' school rating by Ofsted this month .","Staff at St Giles' Junior School in Bedworth, Warwickshire ban schoolgirl .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A terrier destined for a life indoors after vets discovered he suffers from hay fever has been relieved of his symptoms thanks to a Lycra onesie. One-year-old Alfie would be covered in painful, red and itchy sores after going for walks with owner Joanne Mitchell, 50, from Cullingworth, West Yorkshire. The dog was given various treatments including Piriton before Mrs Mitchell discovered the revolutionary silver bodysuit while searching for a cure online. One-year-old Alfie was diagnosed with a pollen allergy after he came up with red itchy sores after walks . Alfie with his owner Joanne Mitchell, 50, who came across the Lycra suit whilst researching treatments online . Mrs Mitchell said: 'He was booked in to be castrated around April, May time and I noticed he had a really really itchy red tummy. 'I thought it might be fleas at first but after talking to the vet we realised it might be a pollen allergy. She added: 'We tried numerous things including Piriton but nothing seemed to work and he was just miserable.' 'It . got to the point where he was just trapped in the house unable to go . out. To have a dog that can’t even go out for a walk is just awful, I . felt terrible.' It was then that she came across US-based company K9 Top Coat and decided to give the one-of-a-kind lightweight, breathable onesie a shot. 'Everything changed from there. He’s so much better now and the sores have really settled down,' she added. Owner Joanne Mitchell has bought Alfie another suit so he can alternate his look . 'He . wears his bodysuit all day long and he loves it. He puts his little . head in and lifts his paws up to help me put it on, it really doesn’t . bother him at all. 'Now he can go and play outside and enjoy running around without a care.' The all-in-one, which can set pet owners back anything from £34 ($58.50) to £50 ($86.50), has proven so popular with the Jack Russell Terrier that Mrs Mitchell has chosen to buy a second outfit. 'It’s been so great I’ve bought him another so I can alternate. He’ll have his own little wardrobe full of them soon.' The idea for the onesie was thought up by June Lotz, co-founder of K9 Top Coat. She said: 'I came up with the idea as a way of controlling shedding. 'Our first child was just beginning to crawl and with three large dogs it was impossible to keep our floors free of dog hair. 'Many people purchase one of our lycra bodysuits and have such great success they purchase more. 'We . have a lot of word of mouth referrals but then again the coat speaks . for itself, there’s nothing like having a dog wearing a lycra bodysuit . in the park or walking down the street to draw people’s attention. 'The . joy I experience when I hear that one of our bodysuits has dramatically . improved the quality of a dog’s life is beyond words. It’s times like . that when I know I have the best job in the world.'","One-year-old terrier would be covered in painful and itchy sores after walks .

"By . Gemma Mullin . The family of an elderly man who was dying of cancer has criticised the hospital he was staying at after a huge rat was found metres from his bedside. Grandfather John Higgins, 82, repeatedly told his family and friends he could see a rat in the light fitting close to an air vent on his ward at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Kent. His son, Robert Langstead, 50, put the sightings down to hallucinations due to the amount of medication his terminally ill dad was on. The rat was photographed (circled) by his son Robert Langstead after spotting it on a windowsill . But while on a visit to the grandfather-of-six on July 15, Mr Langstead spotted the rat as it scurried along a window sill in a waiting room. Whilst walking out of the hospital he spotted another rodent on some stairs and took a picture of it on his mobile phone. Mr Langstead, from Rochester, Kent, . said: ‘Dad was very ill and kept saying he could see rats in the light, . but we just put that down to the strong drugs he had been put on. ‘We couldn’t believe it when we went into the waiting room and saw the rat on the window sill - my sister screamed.’ He added: ‘It’s disgusting a rat was inside the ward - dirty. The creatures could have crawled on him. 'They have six foot windows which open from the bottom about 18 inches off the ground. John Higgins, 82, told family he had spotted a rat in his ward at Medway Maritime Hospital . 'If they opened the top windows, the rats probably wouldn't be able to get in.' He reported the sighting to nurses and security staff who stated there was a zero-tolerance approach to dealing with pests at the site. He said he is outraged at how long it took staff to act. He added: 'They didn't do anything about it that night. The nursing staff we told were just freaked out by the thought of a rat being on the ward. 'When we left we told the security guard at the main entrance and he said he would report it the next morning, so their policy to act immediately to pest control is not working at all.' Just 12 hours after the sighting, Mr Higgins, a retired window cleaner also Rochester, who had been admitted to the hospital with a virus, died. He had been on the pathways to heaven scheme, used to assist the terminally-ill by keeping them comfortable in their final days. His family has since condemned the hospital, which is still in special measures after a report by England’s chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards rated progress there in the last year as ‘inadequate’. A spokesman for Medway NHS Foundation Trust has denied that the rat pictured was in a ward but said it could have been in a hospital corridor. In a statement, they said: ‘Medway NHS Foundation Trust takes a zero-tolerance approach to pests. ‘Any sighting is taken seriously and our pest control contractor is called onsite immediately to assess possible points of entry and compile a report of the areas affected, and the actions put in place for control and prevention. ‘We would like to assure patients and visitors that all pest related issues are closely monitored and we have an effective internal system for reporting any sightings so that everything that should be done, is done.’ Medway NHS Foundation Trust said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to pests and on-site contractors are called immediately if one is spotted .","John Higgins repeatedly told family he could see a rat scurrying on his ward .

"By . Gemma Mullin . This is the shocking moment a thug launched into a sickening attack on a mother and daughter in a city centre bar. The 52 year-old victim said she felt lucky to be alive after being punched so hard by Garth Ward, 20, that he broke her cheekbone. Ward was in a group of eight men who walked into Lammars bar in Manchester's Northern Quarter, where the victims were on a night out. Scroll down for video . The shocking attack on the mother and daughter by Garth Ward in Manchester was caught on CCTV . Shortly before 2am a scuffle broke out between the two groups, resulting in a drink being thrown into the face of a 19-year-old woman. Her mother went to protect her daughter and dry her face, telling the men to ‘back off’. It was then that Ward launched into the attack, punching the mother in the face and knocking over her daughter with the same blow. He then punched the mother again and kicked her to the body before he was dragged away. Her white dress was left covered in her own blood and as he was escorted away by door staff, he spat at another woman. The mother, who asked not to be identified, has suffered lasting nerve damage and has had to give up work because of her injuries. Garth Ward Jnr (left) was jailed for 12 months, while his father Garth Ward Snr (right) is still wanted by police . She said: ‘The attack has changed my personality and lifestyle completely. ‘I am angry that he would hit a female of my petite size with so much force. I feel lucky that I wasn’t killed.’ Ward pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm (ABH) at an earlier hearing following the incident on September 29, 2013. Ward, of Middleton, Manchester, was today sentenced to 12 months behind bars by a judge at Manchester Crown Court. Police are continuing to appeal for information as to the whereabouts of Garth Ward’s father, also called Garth, who is wanted in connection with the incident and is believed to be abroad. Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw said: ‘Ward’s cowardly behaviour caused public outrage at the time when a press appeal was launched in a bid to identify the person responsible from CCTV. ‘We received numerous calls identifying Ward (junior) which we were able to swiftly act upon. ‘This shows that the community who know him are not prepared to put up with his thuggish behaviour.’ The scuffle broke out at Lammars Bar in Manchester between the group of eight men and the mother and daughter .

But Curtis Watson’s magic skills clearly failed him when he wanted to conjure up some quick cash – so he tried to rob an off-licence wearing a monkey mask instead.

"By . Gemma Mullin . Yvonne Preston, 49, has been banned indefinitely after becoming infatuated with one of her pupils . A teacher who declared her love for a pupil with cards quoting One Direction lyrics has been barred from schools indefinitely. Yvonne Preston, 49, a former English teacher at Castle Hall Academy in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, became infatuated with the teenager and showered him with gifts, a teaching tribunal heard. A National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) panel was told the married mother asked the boy to dance with her in front of his class at the end of year prom. The panel also heard how Mrs Preston begged the pupil to see her again after he left school. In a greetings card sent to the boy, she wrote: 'I have loved having you in my life; I’ve loved spoiling you. 'The thought of not seeing you, talking to you and just being with you breaks my heart - so I’m asking don’t go. Don’t leave. Please stay with me!' In a Christmas card she said: 'You mean far too much to me than you should - but I wouldn’t have it any other way.' And in another card she quoted lyrics from One Direction's debut number one single 'What Makes You Beautiful'. She wrote: 'You light up my world like nobody else.' The panel heard that Mrs Preston had bought the pupil, whose exact age has not been disclosed, a mug and calendar, both including her home address, as well as a DVD box set and a concert ticket. Mrs Preston had also downloaded photos of the teenager onto her work laptop and had called him into a storeroom to discuss a comment he had posted on Twitter. The panel heard Mrs Preston, who worked at the school from December 2011 and May 2013, sent inappropriate text messages to another pupil regarding the boy. English teacher Mrs Preston worked at Castle Hall Academy (pictured) from December 2011 until May 2013 . She was barred from teaching at schools, colleges and children’s homes indefinitely. Mrs Preston will have to wait at least two years before she can re-apply to the NCTL - a government body which regulates teachers’ conduct - to have her ban lifted. A teaching panel agreed there was evidence that Mrs Preston was suffering from mental health problems at the time . Members of the panel accepted there was ‘some evidence’ that Mrs Preston was suffering from mental health problems at the time and she had shown ‘genuine remorse’. However the panel along with the NCTL deputy director Alan Meyrick concluded that her behaviour had fallen short and could bring the profession into disrepute. Mr Meyrick said: 'This conduct fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession and amounts to unacceptable professional conduct. 'In addition the panel also found that Mrs Preston’s actions constitute conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute.' The panel decided that while Mrs Preston’s behaviour had not amounted to ‘serious sexual  misconduct’ there had been an ‘abuse of position’. Mrs Preston resigned in June 2013 after disciplinary proceedings were started by the school. Mr Andy Pugh, principal at Castle Hall, said the matter was dealt with by the school more than a year ago. He said the school had taken decisive action as soon as matters were brought to its attention.","Yvonne Preston, 49, sent the teenager concert tickets and love messages .

On Wednesday, a body was found beside a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project, where he was last seen. Scroll down for video . Malaysian police are said to be investigating claims Mr Huntley, right, could have been murdered. His mother, Janet Southwell, left, gave her own DNA to help in the . identification process after his body was found and saya no words can describe the void left by him . Arrival: Gareth Huntley's mother Janet Southwell, (centre) who arrived in Malaysia on Monday was pictured on Friday outside the Forensic Unit at the Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital in Kuantan with Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga (left) Discovery: Malaysian rescue workers prepare to load a body onto an Air Force helicopter on Tioman Island - it has been confirmed it is Mr Huntley . Yesterday, following DNA tests, it was confirmed that the body was that of Mr Huntley, who worked as an accountant. According to the Telegraph, detectives have said they are investigating claims that he was involved in a fight before he disappeared and could have been murdered. There are also said to be claims by local tour guides that his throat had been slit but police did not confirm this. Owner of a bistro, Ab Razib Ali Awang, told the newspaper that most people in the local area think something sinister had happened to the backpacker. He said: I’m not sure if the project [people] are making a false report or maybe not telling the police everything. Hunt: Rescuers had been scouring the area in the hope of finding Mr Huntley for days . He was found on Wednesday near a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where the 34-year-old had been working, according to local reports . A search party consisting of commandos, police and firefighters stumbled across the body when they were returning to the base camp earlier this week . The body was found behind a row of cabins which were occupied by rescue operators over the last three days . 'There are rumours that there was a fight before with a foreigner.' But it has reportedly been denied that there had been any fight or conflict at the turtle project. The claims come as Mr Huntley's distraught family spoke of their devastation after it was confirmed that a body found on Wednesday was his. In a statement they said: 'There are no words that can capture the devastation we feel right now; no words that can capture the kindness, warmth and spirit that Gareth exuded; no words can describe the void he will leave in all of the lives he touched.' His mother Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday and was pictured on Friday outside the Forensic Unit at the Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital in Kuantan with Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga. Mrs Southwell travelled to Malaysia with Miss Natariga almost a week ago to press the authorities into finding him. Police closed off the road leading to the sanctuary after the discovery . Mr Huntley's family and friends had feared there was a lack of action to find the backpacker in spite of the public response so started their own search . His mother, Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday after Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak about the search effort . Gareth Huntley and his girlfriend Kit Natariga. She said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions . She broke down in tears and ran to her cabin a short distance away when news of the body’s discovery was broken to her by Deputy Police Superintendent Johari Yahaya. Before the positive identification, she had told of how she was staying positive in the hope that she would be the ‘friendly face’ her son needed when he came out of the jungle. Search teams, made up of commandos, police and Fire and Rescue Department specialists accompanied by sniffer dogs had spent days searching the jungle for the missing Englishman. But the hunt took a dramatic turn when a search team returned to the conservation headquarters where they had spent three nights. Search: Gareth Huntley's mother Janet Southwell, had taken part in search effort for her son at Juara village on Tioman Island before he was found . Kit Natariga also headed to Tioman Island to join the search for her boyfriend Gareth (left) They unexpectedly saw the badly decomposed body floating face up in the Mentawak River. Dressed in a T-shirt, shorts and shoes, it was just behind a row of cabins being occupied by the rescue teams. With his body being found within the confines of the conservation headquarters, police are questioning whether he even managed to reach the start of the jungle path before tragedy struck in some way. They are also looking at the possibility that Mr Huntley did reach the waterfall and plunged into the river on his return. A further line of inquiry will be whether he went into the water further upstream and his body was then carried to where it was found.

Earlier this week Malaysian authorities insisted they were committed to finding the Briton who went missing on the popular resort whose body was found on Wednesday . A picture of Tioman Island - where the Briton was last seen. His body was found on the island on Wednesday . Tuesday May 27: Gareth Huntley, 34, from London, goes on a trek to visit a waterfall in Tioman Island, off the south eastern coast of Malaysia's mainland. He leaves in the morning and tells friends at the headquarters of a nearby charity project where he is volunteering that he will return by 2pm the same day. He fails to come back so a group goes out to search for him, checking various routes to the waterfall which is 6km away. Wednesday May 28: A further search also proves fruitless. According to fellow volunteer Charles Fisher the police are contacted in the afternoon. He says: 'They sent a couple of members of the police force along to have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of assessing the situation.' Thursday May 29: A group of volunteers embark on another search, while a group from the local community also look for Mr Huntley deep into the jungle. The police are 'no longer physically looking', Mr Fisher says. 'I think they were arranging for a search party but nothing happened.' Friday May 30: Janet Southwell, Mr Huntley's mother, calls on the authorities to do more to search for him. She says: 'He has been missing for four days now, and as yet I have had no contact from any official agency advising me as to the progress of the search.' Saturday May 31: A friend of Mr Huntley, Kyle Neo Kai Fu, who lives locally, says: 'The idea that there is a proper professional search going on is laughable. There are five police, in one boat, and nobody is in control. 'The most likely scenario is that Gareth is injured in a ravine, with a broken leg - and we are running out of time.' Ms Southwell makes a direct plea to Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to 'make one phone call to help my missing son'. Sunday June 1: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who is in Malaysia, speaks to the country's defence minister. He is assured that the authorities will do all they can to find Mr Huntley and they have already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter. Mr Huntley's girlfriend, Kit Natariga, arrives on the island and warns that 'time is running out and we need action as soon as possible'. Monday June 2: Mr Huntley's mother also arrives on the island to support the search effort. She says she wants to see the area for herself and 'get a feel for where he's lost'. His brother, Mark, says there are 103 people searching, alongside several helicopters and speedboats. David Cameron speaks to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak to thank him for the extensive efforts of the search teams. Wednesday June 4: Police searching for Mr Huntley find a body. According to local reports the body, which is not confirmed as the missing Briton, is found in a pond a few yards from a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where Mr Huntley had been working.

"By . Gemma Mullin . Ferrari driver Abdul Salam, who clocked up 48 points on his driving licence, outside Oldham Magistrates' Court . A Ferrari driver who clocked up to 48 points on his driving licence has been fined more than £1,300 for making false statements to obtain insurance. Abdul Salam, 31, from Oldham, Greater Manchester declared that he had a full UK licence when applying for insurance to drive his Ferrari in February, 2012, despite his licence being revoked on September 30, 2009. Salam was found to be driving on the invalid insurance when he was pulled over by a police officer who spotted him driving not wearing a seatbelt. Gary Logan, prosecuting, said that officers checked the licence and found that he had 48 points at that time, however the number of points varied during the course of the investigation with some records stating Salam had around 27 points. The Government's penalty point system means that if a driver accumulates 12 points in three years they will be disqualified. The Institute of Advanced Motorists has previously blamed failures to communicate between the courts and the DVLA - particularly when drivers clocked up repeat points over a short time - for problems in the system. According to the DVLA it routinely contacts the courts when notified that a driver has reached the 12 point threshold and it remains up to the court whether to reopen the case. Salam pleaded guilty to the charge of making a false statement to obtain insurance at Oldham Magistrates' Court yesterday on what would have been the third date a trial had been set for and the 10th listing at court. Salam, a self-employed businessman, pleaded guilty on the basis that he did not know about the penalty points or the fact that his licence had been revoked when he applied for insurance, a basis of plea not accepted by the Crown. Oldham Magistrates' Court, Greater Manchester, where Salam pleaded guilty to the charge of making a false statement to obtain insurance . Jonathan Holt, defending, argued that Salam had not meant to mislead and, while the statements were false, he did not know them to be false at the time he made them. However the law, which dates to the late 1950s, stipulates that the offence is one of strict liability, meaning a defendant can be guilty of the crime without having a guilty mind or knowledge of making a false statement and sentencing was carried out accordingly. Research last year revealed that 7,000 drivers on the road have 12 points or more - and one woman has clocked up a record 42 penalty points - yet still has a licence. It has raised questions in the past about how some motorists have been able to get away without stricter punishments. However drivers who break the law will have their licence 'endorsed' with penalty points - the amount can vary depending on the seriousness of the offence. Points will stay on the licence for at least four years and in some cases its 11 years. New drivers can have their licence revoked if they get six points in the first two years of passing their test. To remove expired endorsements, a postal application must be made for a new one. The insurance, from The Policy Shop, cost Salam £1,800 when it was taken out in February, 2012. The court also heard that Salam's car was later seized by Greater Manchester Police under Operation Wolverine, a scheme which targeted unlicensed and uninsured drivers in Greater Manchester, and Salam paid in excess of £13,000 for insurance to reclaim the car. Salam, who has already been banned from driving for two years following a separate driving case in February, 2013, was fined £875, ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £87 as well as costs of £400, making a total of £1,362. Speaking about how Salam had managed to accrue 48 points on a licence a DVLA spokeswoman said it is up to the courts to decide when a driver is disqualified. She said: 'DVLA's role is to record the information provided by the courts. 'The courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver. 'In January it was reported by The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), the UK's largest independent road safety charity, that a man from Liverpool had been allowed to continue driving despite clocking up 45 points on his licence, beating the previous record of 42 points.'","Abdul Salam, 31, told his insurance company he had a full licence .
He was spotted by police and pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt .
Drivers are usually disqualified for accumulating just 12 points ."
"By . Belinda Robinson . Living in one of Britain's worst postcodes can take a toll on the cost of your car insurance - and if you live anywhere near 'Benefit's Street' in Birmingham you'll pay the highest amount. The stark figures revealed in new research shows that dodgy whipclash claims are the main reason behind sky high car insurance premiums. And Birmingham holds the top ten worst addresses for the highest premiums in the country. Scroll down for video . James Turner Street: The Birmingham street made famous by a Channel 4 documentary for the amount of benefits claimants living there is now also the worst place to live near to get car insurance . Postcodes around the city’s infamous James Turner Street - catapulted to stardom by the Channel 4 series ‘Benefits Street’ - make up the majority of black-listed areas. Insurers said Britain’s second city also has the highest number of bogus whiplash claims - which add £90 to every motorist’s bill. In a survey of all UK cities by SmartWitness Incident Cameras, it found Birmingham’s motor insurance premiums are now seven times higher than Aberdeen - the UK’s cheapest city for car insurance. The price of insuring a BMW 3 Series in Bordesley Green, Birmingham B9 - the worst postcode found - was £1,101.62 per year compared with Aberdeen city centre which comes in at only £157 for the same car. The next nine postcodes are all in Birmingham - and most are within just a few miles of James Turner Street. Penalised: Insurance for drivers who drive a BMW 3 series in Bordesley Green, Birmingham B9 - the worst postcode found - was £1,101.62 per year compared with Aberdeen city centre which comes in at only £157 for the same car .

Overall Birmingham has more than a fifth of the worst 100 postcodes for motor insurance premiums in the country - 22 in total. Aberdeen £156.98 Plymouth £170.43 Bristol £177.03 Oxford £186.55 Edinburgh £187.05 Carlisle £187.51 Cambridge £187.60 Lancaster £194.47 Brighton and Hove £195.06 Norwich £198.61 Glasgow £199.35 Exeter £200.50 Sunderland £213.94 Portsmouth £215.36 York £229.91 Dundee £232.57 Derby £237.36 Southampton £237.60 Gloucester £239.10 Nottingham £253.15 . The second worst city in the UK for car insurance is Liverpool with 17 of the top 100 with East London third, with 12, and Manchester fourth, with 11. North London take fifth place with nine in the top 100 followed by South East London with seven, Bradford with six and Sheffield with three. Insurance figures were calculated for a 43-year-old married man with three children, working as a retail account manager and owning his own home and parking on the street. He drives a £20,695, BMW 318 2012-2014 Diesel 2.0L Manual 4 doors D SE, and does around 6,000 miles a year. SmartWitness managing director Simon Marsh said: 'Part of the reason for the sharp increase for the car insurance premiums is that Birmingham has become the capital of whiplash claims in the UK. The six top areas for Third Party Injury (TPI) claims are all in Birmingham and it’s no great surprise that those neighbourhoods mirror very closely those with the highest premiums in our survey.' The top five areas with the highest number of third party injury claims were B8, B12, B10, B9 and B6. Simon said: 'Most insurance experts have said that whiplash claims have cost motorists around £90 a year in increased premiums. 'Over 40 percent of motor insurance claims are contested but only two percent of SmartWitness claims are, so you can see that having reliable video evidence practically eliminates bogus whiplash claims.' Other UK cities with high numbers of TPI claims are Bradford with four of the top 20 worst postcodes, Manchester next with three, and Liverpool and London have one each. The cities with low TPI claims also had the lowest insurance premiums. Several of Scotland’s cities had the lowest premiums in the UK and also the lowest number of TPI claims. Aberdeen had three postcodes in the top 20 lowest areas for TPI claims - and is the cheapest UK city for car insurance.","According to research, where you live determines cost of car insurance .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s often said that mothers share a special maternal bond with their child that is unmatched by others, including the father, despite his paternal role. But a study says that men can actually have just as strong a bond with their child, especially in the absence of the mother. And it could force a re-think on the role dads can play in the development of children. A study by a researcher at Oregon State University says that men can take on the role of being a mother (stock image shown). Dr Saturn says that when a mother is absent, perhaps through divorce, the father assumes the role. This is in addition to playing the role of father as well - they can do both . The research titled ‘Flexibility of the father’s brain’ was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ‘Shifts in society and culture have led to increases in men’s involvement in the care of infants,’ writes researcher Dr Sarina Saturn of Oregon State University. Many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier. But research has found children can spot this tactic, and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them. Once spotted, a study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves. Determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people, explained Hyowon Gweon, lead author of the paper which was published in the journal Cognition. ‘When someone provides us information, we not only learn about what is being taught, we also learn something about that person,' she said. 'If the information is accurate and complete, then you might also trust that person in the future.' ‘The modern-day family comes in a variety of structures, and more and more people are playing unconventional roles in childrearing.’ In the study, reports New Statesman, the brains of parents were scanned while they watched videos of their interactions with children. Two systems of the brain were stimulated during this activity: the emotional network and mental processing. Fathers who said they were secondary to the mother in providing care for the child were found to have less of an emotional response than their partner. But those who were raising a child by themselves were found to have a similar emotional response to mothers while retaining the critical thinking of secondary fathers. This meant they were performing both roles of mother and father. The finding could be important for cases of divorce, where battles over custody are often ruled in the mother’s favour. And the study could bring into question the role men can play in a child’s upbringing. When a mother is present the father's brain is less active emotionally, but they retain a level of critical thinking that makes them paternal. In the absence of a mother dads take on the role of both parents. The research could be important for the role dads can play in kids' upbringing (stock image shown)","Study by a researcher at Oregon State University says that men can take on the role of being a mother .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Legal action: Gillian Stokes, 44, won her unfair dismissal case against Shrewsbury School but did not get compensation . A tuck shop lady who won an unfair dismissal case from a prestigious independent school was arrested yesterday after driving onto the school's cricket pitch and doing 'doughnuts.' Eyewitnesses saw Gillian Stokes, 44, drive onto the pitch at Shrewsbury School in Shropshire with such force that she scattered staff and pupils as she did high-speed doughnuts in her car. The school, whose alumni include Charles Darwin, descended into chaos as Ms Stokes then chased a teacher around with a fire extinguisher. The former tuck shop worker had been sacked from her job at the £30,000-a-year school and took them to an employment tribunal claiming she was unfairly dismissed after she was fired in May 2013. But although she won the hearing in Birmingham, she did not receive any compensation. According to staff, pupils were practicing cricket on the cricket pitch - which the cricket-writer Sir Neville Cardus described as the 'The most beautiful playing fields in the world, spreading and imperceptibly mingling with the pasture land of Shropshire.' Ms Stokes then drove onto the pitch and did several high-speed doughnuts, spinning her car, which has personalised number plates on it, into big circles. No students were injured. But, members of staff quickly realised it was her and called the police while leading pupils to safety. She was arrested by West Mercia Police, according to The Telegraph but a spokesman declined to give further comment on her case. Kathy . Campbell, a spokesperson for Shrewsbury School told Mail Online: 'Ms . Stokes did briefly and unexpectedly enter the School site yesterday . (contravening an injunction banning her from the premises). 'Ms . Stokes drove her car onto the cricket pitch at speed but nobody was . injured. The police were called and the incident was dealt with swiftly . and calmly. 'We . praise the professional and dignified approach adopted by all members . of the School community who were involved on this occasion. The matter . is now being dealt with by West Mercia Police.' Shrewsbury School pitch: Before the incident, pupils were practicing cricket on the cricket pitch, described as the 'the most beautiful playing field in the world' However it's not the first time Ms Stokes has been in trouble. Days after she was fired, she allegedly sent an . email to all 750 students at the school claiming she had been sexually . assaulted by a female member of staff. She had also been accused of making threatening phone calls and sending . abusive text messages to former colleagues she felt ‘had betrayed her’, . the tribunal heard. Ms .

Claims: Ms Stokes allegedly drove onto the pitch and did several high-speed doughnuts with her car which has personalised number plates . She also added . that she felt ‘traumatised’ following the alleged assaults and claimed . she was threatened by another member of staff in February 2012 because . she organised an unauthorised union meeting. She said: ‘He threatened me with the sack and placed his hands on my polo-shirt collars and said 'we will get you for this.' Ms . Stokes admitted sending an email to staff and pupils claiming she had . been sexually assaulted saying she ‘regretted her actions’ adding that . she did it while suffering ‘great emotional distress.’ However, she denied sending messages to former colleagues, including one which read: ‘Careful when you go home.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . For parents, the possibility of a child falling into a pool unattended and drowning is a very real and concerning threat. So to put their mind at ease, one company has designed a headband that alerts a parent’s smartphone if a child accidentally falls in water. By syncing with an iOS device, the sensor sends a warning via Bluetooth and lets the adult come to the aid of their child as quickly as possible. Scroll down for video . A Connecticut-based company has revealed a device to keep kids safe near water. The £58 ($99) iSwimband alerts parents when their children have fallen into a pool. It can also let parents know when their kids have been underwater too long. In both instances an alarm is sent to the parent's phone to warn them . The waterproof device is known as the iSwimband and costs aroun $99 (around £60). iSwimband is a small, wireless sensor that is worn either as a headband or a wristband says thecompany. The sensor is paired with a compatible Bluetooth-enabled smart device running the free iSwimband app. When both the sensor and app are activated, the app continually monitors the status of the sensor. If the app determines that the sensor has been submerged into water, or submerged for a (user-definable) dangerous period of time, it notifies the caregiver via audiovisual alerts. The caregiver can then investigate the circumstances and intervene if necessary. The device apparently has a battery life of hundreds of hours of active monitoring. It has an effective range of 100 feet (30 metres) or more. It sits around the head of a child and has a Bluetooth-enabled sensor at the front. There is also a wristband option available. The wristband version is designed for children who are non-swimmers and fall into a pool by mistake. When the device detects the child has fallen into water, it sends an alert immediately to the parent so they can come and rescue them. The headband version, meanwhile, is designed for slightly older children who are able to swim. It detects when a child has been underwater for too long, perhaps because they are struggling to swim to the surface. In this instance an alarm will again sound on the phone, alerting the parent to come and save their child. The waterproof Bluetooth device has a range of about 100 feet (30 metres). It attaches around the head of a child and has a sensor at the front. There is also a wristband option available . Up to eight iSwimbands can be synced to any one iOS device. Speakers can also be linked to provide louder alerts. However, the company adds that it is important the parent knows the general location their child is in, as the device does not have GPS, although this is something they to add in future. 'iSwimband is the world's first wearable sensor designed to alert you with an audible/visual alarm on your smartphone or tablet (and linked speakers) if a swimmer has been submerged dangerously long, or if your non-swimmer enters the water,' the company says on their website. 'While nothing can replace diligent human supervision, iSwimband provides you and your loved ones with an added layer of protection around water.'","Connecticut-based company reveals device to keep kids safe near water .

"By . Belinda Robinson . An incredible array of different footballs show off the history of balls used during the FIFA World cup. The development, testing and completion of this year's FIFA World Cup football is among the balls which will join the line up of 12 special balls which have all been used in the beautiful game. The 'Brazuca' - a slang term used for Brazil or Brazilian - is the twelfth ball made by official manufacturer Adidas. Beautiful game: Just 12 of the balls used in World Cups through the years are lined up in a v-shape . But gone are the days of heavy pigskins . and stitching associated with football in the fifties - Neymar, Rooney . and company will be using a ball made of only six panels. It should provide improved grip, touch, stability and aerodynamics on the pitch. The . Brazuca has been tested by 600 footballers over the last two-and-a-half . years - which goalkeepers hope will make it less volatile than the . Jabulani from four years ago in South Africa. Brazuca: The Brazuca ball is pictured with the world cup - it is the twelfth ball made by official manufacturer Adidas . Manufacturing: A worker puts the finishing touches to the Brazuca, a ball made of only six panels . The brazuca’s colours and ribbon design of the ball panels symbolise the vibrancy and fun associated with football in the South American country. It has its own unique identity and represents a piece of footballing history. Mexico world cup ball 1970: The World Cup ball in Mexico was the first FIFA World Cup to be televised around the globe, so, Adidas added 12 black pentagonal panels to make it more visible on black and white television and named it after the Telstar satellite . The iconic Telstar was Adidas' first World Cup ball, made of 32 separate panels to give it the roundest sphere for its time. The World Cup in Mexico in 1970 was the first FIFA World Cup to be televised around the globe, so, Adidas added 12 black pentagonal panels to make it more visible on black and white television and named it after the Telstar satellite. The black and white pattern also helped players to see the spin of the ball as it traveled through the air. To this day, the Adidas Telstar remains the common design template for all generic soccer balls. The tournament was won by a victorious Brazil side this year. Mexico world cup ball 1970: This FIFA World Cup was the first to be televised around the globe, so, Adidas added 12 black pentagonal panels to the ball to make it more visible on black and white television and named it after the Telstar satellite . Such was the success of the previous World Cup's Telstar that Adidas simply replaced the old gold branding with black branding for the World Cup in Germany 1974. Other than a slight change in appearance, the only other difference was its polyurethane coating which provided waterproofing for the ball as well as protection from damage such as scuffs and tears. It was one of two designs used in Germany '74 - the Telstar Durlast and the Chile Durlast, which was exactly the same but completely white. West Germany were victorious on home soil on this occasion. Telstar Durlast: The official world cup ball from 1974 had a polyurethane coating which provided waterproofing for the ball as well as protection from damage such as scuffs and tears . By now, Adidas were well into the pattern of choosing names . appropriate for the host nation, so 'Tango' was the name chosen for the . ball used in Argentina in 1978. It was the first to feature the adidas . trademark, which was a printed design of interconnected curved-edge . triangles known as 'triads'. It is said to have taken its inspiration from the 'deep passion, emotion and elegance of Argentina', according to fan site soccerballworld.com. This year, Italy won 3-1 and even missed a penalty to boot. Tango Rosario: The official world cup ball from 1978 was the first to feature the adidas trademark, which was a printed design of interconnected curved edge triangles known as triads . This was the first ball to be made of a mix of real leather and synthetic material. It was once again composed of 32 hand sewn panels, with the same black . and white Tango design: the curved triangles were printed on every . hexagon, which formed circles around the 12 pentagonal panels, giving . the ball a visual illusion of 12 identical circles. The tournament's top scorer was Paolo Rossi of Italy with six goals, including a hat-trick in a second group game against Brazil and one in the final - which the Italian side won. Tango Espana: The official ball from the Spanish world cup in 1982 was once again composed of 32 hand sewn panels, with the same black and white Tango design . This was a completely new model, developed for the World Cup in Mexico. Made of synthetic material in layers, each with different properties to give strength to the ball, it was able to retain its shape and be fully waterproof. The Azteca Mexico was a hand-sewn ball, and for the first time, synthetic material, rather than leather was used to produce it. With its never-before-achieved performance on hard ground, at high altitude, and in wet conditions, Azteca represented a massive leap forward for the game. Its elaborately decorated design was inspired by the hosting nation’s native Aztec architecture and murals. In the final match, Argentinan captain Maradona memorably sent a perfectly weighted pass to Jorge Burruchaga, who slotted the ball in to make it 3-2 - which sealed the match. Azteca ball from mexico 1986:  The official ball from the Mexico world cup in 1986 was a hand-sewn ball, and for the first time, synthetic material, rather than leather was used to produce it . The Etrusco triads featured an Etruscan lion within their design. The ball was again manufactured entirely from fully synthetic fibre layers, including one of latex to create stability and resistance to tearing. In the final, Argentina met Germany FR – for the second World Cup running. The only goal in a very poor game came from an 85th-minute penalty after Völler had been brought down in the area. Brehme’s spot kick won the match for the Germans. At the World Cup this year, Franz Beckenbauer became only the second man to win a World Cup both as a player and a manager. Etrusco Unico: The official ball from the Italy world cup in 1990 featured an Etruscan lion within its design . Inspired by space technology, high velocity rockets and America’s 'quest for the stars', the USA 1994 match ball was named the Questra. The technical development for the Questra took place in the adidas center for ball development in France, followed by test games in France, Germany and the USA with professional players, amateurs and youth teams. Enveloped in a layer of polystyrene foam, the Questra had greater ball acceleration when kicked, felt softer to the touch gave players better ball control. Thanks to a brilliant goal by Claudio Taffarel’s, Brazil won their fourth FIFA World Cup. Qestra: The official ball from the USA world cup 1994 was inspired by space technology, high velocity rockets and America's quest for the stars . The Tricolore sported the French red-white-blue tri-colour. Its triads incorporated the symbols of the host nation, France, i.e. a cockerel, a high-speed train and a turbine. The ball itself was based on an entirely new synthetic material featuring 'syntactic foam', claiming to give better compression and more explosive rebound characteristics than its predecessor. The foam was made up of gas-filled micro-bubbles that distributed energy equally when the ball was kicked. France, the team that had been an unlucky semi-finalist in both 1982 and 1986, got their just deserts this year after a goal from Emmanuel Petit which got them the title. Tricolore: The official ball from the France world cup 1998 was based on an entirely new synthetic material featuring syntactic foam . This was the result of three years of improvement on the 'Tricolore' at the adidas research centre in Scheinfeld in southern Germany. The adidas triad design had now become two single, enlarged triads with the points turning into clockwise arrows in the colours of grey, red and gold. The background was no longer a traditional pure white but more of a champagne colour. Over 2,500 balls were supplied for the finals and an estimated six million of the high-quality match balls and replica-quality balls were sold worldwide. Brazil won the tournament this year. Fevernova: The official ball from the Japan world cup in 2002, over 2,500 balls were supplied for the finals . This was Adidas' best performing ball ever. According to FIFA: 'Thanks to a revolutionary 14-panel ball configuration, players were able to show their true skills, as the quality and performance characteristics were identical every time they kicked the ball.' It also underwent rigorous scientific testing by the Sports Technology Research Group of the University of Loughborough, one of the leading institutions of its kind worldwide. These tests confirmed that the Teamgeist was more round, precise and consistent than any other competetive match ball. Italy won the tournament this year, claiming their fourth World Cup title. The Teamgeist: The official ball from the Germany world cup 2006 underwent rigorous scientific testing by the Sports Technology Research Group of the University of Loughborough . The Jabulani, which means ‘to celebrate’ in Zulu, was adorned in 11 colours in tribute to Adidas' 11 previous World Cup balls. It used for the first time 'grip and groove' technology - thermally-bonded panels twisting around the ball for extra aerodynamics. But it was met with a storm of criticism from players during the tournament. Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César compared it to a 'supermarket' ball that favored strikers and worked against goalkeepers . Italian keeper Gianluigi Buffon said: 'The new model is absolutely . inadequate and I think it's shameful letting play such an important . competition, where a lot of champions take part, with a ball like this.' In the final, Spain, the European champions, defeated third-time finalists the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time, with Andrés Iniesta's goal in the 116th minute giving Spain their first world title - the first European nation to win the tournament outside its home continent.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Colin Furze - the eccentric inventor behind the X-men Wolverine claws, magnetic shoes, flamethrower and more - is at it again. This time, he’s developed a machine to replicate the sound a fart makes, and pointed it towards France from Dover. A valveless pulsejet was used to create the incredibly loud sound, which apparently was heard by two people in Calais - 26 miles (42km) away across the English Channel. Scroll down for video . 34 year-old Colin Furze from Lincolnshire has unveiled his latest creation. Using a pulse jet engine he created a contraption (shown) that was heard in France . A pulse jet engine is a type of engine in which the combustion happens in loud pulses and is fired by jets. They can be made with few or no moving parts and can ignite a mixture of air with the majority of fuels available. Pulse jets are more commonly used in drones, for flying control line and . radio-controlled aircraft as well as industrial drying and home heating . equipment. The engines convert fuel into heat, making them perfect for boilers, for example. Boeing . has a proprietary pulse jet engine technology called Pulse Ejector . Thrust Augmentor (PETA), and plans to use pulse jet engines to lift . military and commercial aircraft vertically from a standing position. In the video 34-year-old Furze and a crowd of fans gather to watch the device in action. The father-of-one ignites the gas inside the jet which begins the combustion process inside the jet. This creates a noise that Furze says ‘kind of sounds like a fart from a distance.’ He them calls up people in Calais to see if they heard the noise - which they apparently did. The device used in the video is a valveless pulse jet. A pulse jet engine is a lightweight form of jet propulsion. Within a pipe it allows combustion to occur in pulses with little or not input from the user. Furze directed his machine to Calais from Dover - a distance of 26 miles (shown). And after calling people in Calais he found that the sound had been heard . The device used in the video is a valveless pulse jet, seen here being used by Furze in a previous test. A pulse jet engine is a lightweight form of jet propulsion. Within a pipe it allows combustion to occur in pulses with little or not input from the user aside from fuel . Furze created the valveless pulse jet by making a U-shaped pipe that has fuel pumped directly in a combustion chamber. Once the fuel is ignited the engine roars to life. ‘The pulse jet is a wonderful thing, its simplicity is its best strength,’ Furze writes on his website. ‘As an engine it’s not great as most of the energy is wasted on heat and noise but for this task it’s that noise we need.’ Furze said his pulse jet was one of the largest that has been built. In a previous video he shows how he built and tested the engine for the stunt. This latest milestone follows some of his other crazy inventions such as Wolverine's claws from X-Men and magnetic shoes that let the wearer walk on the ceiling.","34 year-old Colin Furze from Lincolnshire has unveiled his latest creation .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . They were intended to be among the first animals to join the 350-mile-high club, but now a group of geckos sent into space to reproduce may be at risk. The five lizards - four male and one female - launched on a research satellite on 19 July to study the effects of weightlessness on their sex lives. But Russian space officials have now revealed that the Foton-M4 satellite is not responding to commands, and there are fears the mission may be lost. A satellite containing five geckos is feared out of control. The five lizards are flying in the Gecko-F4 experiment aboard the satellite (shown). They are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity. Their habitat, monitored by video camera, has enough food for two months . Five lizards are flying on the Gecko-F4 experiment aboard the satellite. Contained in a small room, they are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity. The species being used is the Mauritius ornate day gecko (Phelsuma ornate), according to Spaceflight 101, which can reach up to 4.7 inches (12 centimetres) in length. Inside their habitat is a ventilation system to supply fresh air, food for two months, environmental control in the form of temperature and light and a waste disposal system. A video camera is being used to monitor their behaviour and any eggs that are produced. These are expected to hatch after 40 days, which means they would hatch while the mission is still in space - an important goal that would assess the effects of microgravity on birth. If control of the satellite is regained, the geckos and their offspring will be assessed on their return to Earth. The Foton-M series of satellites are a continuation of the Russian Bion spacecraft, which are intended to observe the effects of space travel on different species. Aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms from both Russia and Germany. The two-month mission was planned to monitor by video how well the geckos sexually reproduce in space before returning them safely to Earth. Following the launch, the satellite was failing to respond to commands to start its engine and move to a higher orbit, according to the Progress space firm. However the rest of its systems are operating nominally, which means the animals on board are still alive. ‘The equipment which is working in automatic mode, and in particular the experiment with the geckos is working according to the programme,’ said Oleg Voloshin, a spokesman of Russia's Institute of Medico-Biological Problems, which is running the experiment. Progress said the design of the Foton-M4 ‘allows for the functioning of the satellite in automatic mode for a long time.’ The biological experiment launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan last week is feared lost. Ground controllers are unable to communicate with the Foton-M4 satellite (illustration shown). The Foton series of satellites are designed to perform biological experiments in space . A space expert cited by Interfax said that in its current orbit the satellite could stay up in space as long as three or four months. Regaining control over the satellite's engine will be needed to ensure its controlled return to Earth as planned in two months to recover the geckos for further study. At the moment the spacecraft is stuck in an orbital height of about 155 miles (250 kilometres). The original mission specification, however, called for the spacecraft to be raised to an altitude of 357 miles (575 km). But the planned burn to get the spacecraft to this height did not occur after the launch due to a malfunction, leaving it stuck in a lower orbit. Ground controllers are now rushing to try and regain communication, as it's unknown how long it can survive at this lower orbit with atmospheric drag. If control is regained, the capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere in mid-September and land via parachute in southern Russia. Failure to do so will mean it will be unlikely that the animals on board can be returned alive to Earth. A similar fate befell gerbils, mice and fish aboard a Russian Bion-M satellite last year, which crashed shortly after launch. Pictured is the launch of the satellite on a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in the early hours of 19 July. Aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms. It is a continuation of Russia's Bion series of satellites, which are also designed to perform biological experiments in space .","A biological experiment launched from Kazakhstan last week is feared lost .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Around 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen levels increased and gave rise to life as we know it. Before this time, the lack of oxygen in Earth’s oceans and land would have made animal and plant life impossible. But now scientists have found evidence of ‘oxygen oases’ that formed before the 2.4 billion year figure commonly cited, suggesting that the first steps toward life may have started earlier than first thought. Researchers have 'found' ancient oxygen in so-called shallow shelf pools (stock image shown) and shallow seas. They were studying rocks 2.8 billion years old in Steep Rock Lake, Canada. Within the rocks they found limestone unchanged since its formation, which only could have formed with oxygen present . In a separate study, scientists say that life on Earth could have started in volcanic vents on the seafloor. Researchers have developed a new approach to simulating the processes that may have led to the emergence of cell metabolism on Earth - a crucial biological function for all living organisms. The research could help scientists understand whether it is possible for life to have emerged in similar environments on other worlds. Co-author Terry Kee, of the University of Leeds, said: 'What we are trying to do is to bridge the gap between the geological processes of the early Earth and the emergence of biological life on this planet.' Previously, some scientists have proposed that living organisms may have been transported to Earth by meteorites. However, there is more support for the theory that life emerged on Earth in places like hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, forming from inanimate matter such as the chemical compounds found in gases and minerals. The researchers, led by Dr Robert Riding of the University of Tennessee, collected 2.8-billion-year old rock samples from Steep Rock Lake in Ontario, Canada reports New Scientist. The area they studied was once an isolated shallow sea in which limestone formed. When analysing the rocks they found that the limestone had remained unchanged for 2.8 billion years - a key indicator oxygen was once there. Limestone can only form when calcium carbonate - its main constituent - is stripped of its dissolved iron. For this to happen oxygen must be present, as it interacts with dissolved iron to form iron-rich minerals. The appearance of limestone pre-dating than 2.4 billion years ago, therefore, suggests that oxygen must have been forming before it became widespread. The origin of this oxygen was likely bacteria, which pumped out oxygen from cleaner water. And incredibly these oases were thought to exist for just 5 million years before sea levels rose and the oases were swallowed up. Dr Robert Riding of the University of Tennessee and his colleagues collected rock samples 2.8 billion years old from Steep Rock Lake in Ontario, Canada (shown). The area they studied was once an isolated shallow sea in which limestone formed. And when analysing the rocks they found limestone that had remained unchanged . Current evidence suggests that eukaryotes, life such as algae [stock image shown], did not appear on Earth until about 2 billion years ago. Dr Riding says 'it is possible that the build-up of oxygen levels in early oases such as Steep Rock could have provided the conditions that first promoted eukaryote evolution' However, . the appearance of oxygen at the time would have been poisonous to most . bacteria, meaning they would have had to evolve a defence mechanism from . the gas before it went ‘global’. And . perhaps this early exposure to the once 'poisonous' gas gave organisms . the ability they needed to become oxygen-breathers, and gave rise to . life as we know it. ‘Figuring out just when and where oxygen first accumulated in abundance has been a puzzle,’ Dr Riding tells MailOnline. ‘Our . suggestion that the limestones preserved at Steep Rock in Canada . represent a 2800 million year old oxygen oasis is novel because it is . the first time that an oxygen oasis has been specifically identified.’ Dr Riding continued: ‘Over the past 2,800 million years or more oxygen has built up progressively to the point where today’s oceans are almost entirely oxygenated and today’s atmosphere contains 20 per cent oxygen. ‘Oxygen is essential for eukaryotes (all animal and plant life). ‘Current evidence suggests that eukaryotes (such as algae) did not appear on Earth until about 2,000 million years ago or younger. ‘There is no evidence of eukaryotes at Steep Rock. But it is possible that the build-up of oxygen levels in early oases such as Steep Rock could have provided the conditions that first promoted eukaryote evolution. ‘However, as we point out, the Steep Rock oasis may not have survived for longer than about 5 million years, so the transient nature of these early oases could have been an obstacle to sustained development of early eukaryotes.’","Researchers from the University of Tennessee 'find' ancient oxygen .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Parts of the primordial soup in which life arose have been maintained in our cells today according to scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA). Research published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry reveals how cells in plants, yeast and very likely also in animals still perform ancient reactions. These were thought to have been responsible for the origin of life some 4 billion years ago. Scientists at the University of East Anglia say our cells have an ancient ability to perform reactions similar to the origin of life 4 billion years ago (illustrated). The primordial soup theory suggests life began in a pond or ocean. Mitochondria (illustrated) continue to perform similar actions today . Every living thing on Earth depends on a mysterious tangle of molecules called ribosomes. These are the cell’s protein factories, translating the genetic information in DNA into an amino acid sequence to create proteins. Scientists believe that the ribosome - whose history is difficult to track - holds clues to how the first molecules of life came together around four billion years ago. Now researchers are a step closer to uncovering these clues after modelling the evolution of these biological factories in unprecedented detail. The core of the ribosome is essentially the same in all living systems, while the outer regions expand and become complicated as species gain complexity. By digitally peeling back the layers of modern ribosomes, scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta were able to model the structures of the very first of these biological factories. 'The history of the ribosome tells us about the origin of life,' said Loren Williams, a professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The study compared three-dimensional structures of ribosomes from a variety of species of varying biological complexity, including humans, yeast, bacteria and archaea. The researchers found distinct fingerprints in the ribosomes where new structures were added to the ribosomal surface without altering the core. The research team then worked the process backwards in time to generate models of simple, primordial ribosomes. The primordial soup theory suggests that life began in a pond or ocean as a result of the combination of metals, gases from the atmosphere and some form of energy, such as a lightning strike, to make the building blocks of proteins which would then evolve into all species. The new research shows how small pockets of a cell - known as mitochondria - continue to perform similar reactions in our bodies today. These reactions involve iron, sulfur and electro-chemistry and are still important for functions such as respiration in animals and photosynthesis in plants. 'Cells confine certain bits of dangerous chemistry to specific compartments of the cell,' said Lead researcher Dr Janneke Balk, from the UEA’s school of Biological Sciences and the John Innes Centre (JIC). 'For example small pockets of a cell called mitochondria deal with electrochemistry and also with toxic sulfur metabolism. 'These are very ancient reactions thought to have been important for the origin of life. 'Our research has shown that a toxic sulfur compound is being exported by a mitochondrial transport protein to other parts of the cell. 'We need sulfur for making iron-sulfur catalysts, again a very ancient chemical process. 'The work shows that parts of the primordial soup in which life arose has been maintained in our cells today, and is in fact harnessed to maintain important biological reactions.' The research was carried out at UEA and JIC in collaboration with Dr Hendrik van Veen at the University of Cambridge. It was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. This image from the researchers shows a normal plant (left) and a plant that cannot export sulfur from the mitochondria anymore (right, looking very small and yellow), while at the same time an ancient enzyme required . to detoxify sulfur inside mitochondria is also inactivated, suggesting the cells retain an ancient ability .","Scientists at the University of East Anglia say our cells have ancient ability .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Meerkats are often seen as easy going, comical creatures, but in reality they hide a much darker personality. Research into the desert creatures, which live in groups with a dominant breeding pair and many adult helpers, found the alpha female flourishes when she maintains the sole right to breed. This means mothers will often prevent their own daughters from breeding through the use of violence, and have been known to kill their competitors’ offspring. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh studied the impact of giving contraceptive jabs to adult female helpers in 12 groups of meerkats (stock image shown). They found the alpha female flourishes when she has the sole right to breed. Mothers will use violence to stop their daughters from breeding . It may seem counterintuitive to stick people who don’t get on in a room together and ask them to make difficult decisions, but it could produce the best results, according to  research. Conflicting views help increase the accuracy and effectiveness of decisions because they can make members of a group question why they have certain goals, and consider the goals of others. To study this theory, researchers looked at the behaviour and decision making processes of meerkats, but the same principles could be applied to other social animals including humans. The research was carried out by the London School of Economics and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. It found that if multiple members in a meerkat group have different goals, when an individual makes a mistake, it has less impact on the group as a whole. This is because that mistake is from a faction, rather than the collective, so can be offset by another member’s actions relatively quickly. They have also been known to banish other females who reproduce to ensure plentiful resources for the alpha pair's pups. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh studied the impact of giving contraceptive jabs to adult female helpers in 12 groups of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert, to ensure they could not reproduce for six months. During this time, dominant females were less aggressive towards helpers and foraged more. They also gained more weight and had bigger pups. The female helper meerkats experienced less violence than usual from the alpha female, and provided more care and food for the pups. The study proved how this way of life, also found in many animals such as ants and bees, can prove effective despite its sinister side. Dr Matthew Bell of the University of Edinburgh, School of Biological Sciences, who led the study, said: ‘The meerkat way of life is a paradox, in which alpha females will attack their daughters, banish them from the group and infanticise their offspring. ‘Our study reveals that dominant animals are worse off when subordinates in their group try to breed - explaining why they brutally suppress others much of the time. 'We expected this result, but its impact exceeded our expectations.’ The study, published in Nature Communications, was carried out by the Universities of Edinburgh, Cambridge, Exeter and Pretoria with the Kalahari Meerkat Project in South Africa. It was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council. In the study dominant females were less aggressive towards helpers and foraged more, gaining more weight and having bigger pups. It proved how this way of life, also found in many animals such as ants and bees (stock image of Western Honey Bee shown) can prove effective despite its sinister side .","Scientists from the University of Edinburgh studied the impact of giving contraceptive jabs to adult female helpers in 12 groups of meerkats .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . SpaceX has successfully completed the second soft-landing in the ocean of its reusable rocket system with a view to landing it on solid ground - possibly by the end of the year. The rocket was the first stage of a Falcon 9 that launched on 14 July, which took six Orbcomm satellites into orbit. An on-board camera captured the descent, and the data gathered during the trip by SpaceX will improve the landing on upcoming flights. Scroll down for video . California-based SpaceX has released a video (screenshot shown) of its second successful rocket touchdown. The test is an important stepping stone to landing rockets on the ground. On this occasion the Falcon 9 rocket had a 'soft' landing in the Atlantic Ocean . The first stage of the rocket, which is the bottom part of it, separated about two minutes and 43 seconds after the launch on 14 July. Falcon . 9 topped with SpaceX fairing is 224.4 feet (68.4 meters) tall and 12 . feet in diameter (the fairing is 17 feet in diameter). Its . nine first-stage Merlin engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust . at sea level, rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as Falcon 9 climbs . out of the Earth’s atmosphere. Falcon . 9 is named after the Millennium Falcon starship in the Star Wars movies. The . number 9 refers to the nine Merlin engines that power Falcon 9’s first . stage; one Merlin vacuum engine powers the second stage. At this point the rocket was more than 31 miles (50km) high. Just under six minutes later it then began to start the process of re-entry. This started with what is known as a boost back burn, which took it on a parabola towards its target landing in the ocean. It then ignited its engines again, having shut them off, to reduce its speed as it passed through the atmosphere. This limits the amount of heat the rocket experiences on re-entry. Once through the atmosphere, the rocket again underwent an unpowered descent before it ignited the engines once more above the ocean. Here the landing legs deployed, which will one day be used to set the rocket down on the ground, and it touched down in the ocean. As planned, the rocket then fell over horizontally, and the impact with the water destroyed the hull. The video itself is not very clear because ice covered the camera as the rocket passed down through the atmosphere. However SpaceX has acknolwedged this and said they are taking measures to limit the build up of ice and . spots on the camera so that future videos are of better quality. Later this year SpaceX plans to attempt to land one of its Falcon 9 rockets on a floating barge. The ultimate goal is to build reusable rockets that can return from space. Pictured is the Grasshopper test rocket, which SpaceX has been using to perform 'hops' up to low altitudes and practice landing on solid ground . ‘This test confirms that the Falcon 9 booster is able consistently to re-enter from space at hypersonic velocity, restart main engines twice, deploy landing legs and touch down at near zero velocity,’ SpaceX said in a news release. Its ultimate goal, as mentioned earlier, is to make the rockets reusable and have them touch down on land. And from their news release, it seems like their first attempt at doing this will be on a floating barge. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos holds a patent for landing rockets on barges, though, so it is not known if he will challenge Elon Musk over this. ‘At this point, we are highly confident of being able to land successfully on a floating launch pad or back at the launch site and refly the rocket with no required refurbishment,’ the company says. This launch vehicle was a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying a payload of Orbcomm communications satellites, which lifted off from launch complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Monday 14 July (pictured) SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has grand plans for his space agency. With help from Nasa he has grown the company significantly in a decade. It is now capable of taking cargo to the ISS with its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket and, beginning possibly in the next few years, the company will take humans into space . They also reveal how the next water landing will be on flight 13 of the Falcon 9 series of rocket, which will take place in September this year and will carry the fourth scheduled Dragon cargo mission to the ISS (sixth flight of the Dragon overall). This will have a ‘low probability of success’ because the rocket will be without its stabilising landing struts, according to SapceX. The first attempt to touch down on a barge will be on flight 14, which could be as early as October. This would be the first rocket ever successfully retrieved from space without landing in water. On these initial flights, SpaceX is being very cautious with the rocket’s re-entry through the atmosphere. They are using a lot of fuel to bring the speed down as much as possible to prevent significant damage being done to the rocket. In future, however, it’s likely they will push the limits of re-entry forces so they are able to waste less fuel bringing the rocket back to Earth. The development of this capability is an important step in making rockets reusable. SpaceX’s ultimate goal is to have rockets launch to orbit then return to Earth intact.","California-based SpaceX has completed a second rocket touchdown .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Google has been touting the benefits of its self-driving cars for years, so a team of stuntmen decided to put the technology to the test. Five drivers steered automated Hyundai Genesis’ into a convoy before driving towards a lorry at a test track in California. This video reveals the moment the leading car stops just in time, and ultimately causes the four cars behind it to all stop too. Scroll down for full video . A stunt to demonstrate the emergency stop capabilities of the Hyundai . driverless car has been carried out. A series of cars were driven in a . convoy then all the drivers, except for the first, jumped from the . moving cars onto a flatbed lorry. A lorry in front of the procession . then braked suddenly, forcing them to stop autonomously . New laws are to be drawn up to allow driverless cars to take to Britain’s roads. Ministers admit the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves. With technology being developed on both sides of the Atlantic, the government wants to ensure that Britain is not overtaken by Google’s determination to see its cars used legally on the streets of California. In May Google unveiled . its computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no . steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, just buttons for start, . pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route. These tests were carried out at the Mojave Desert, California. As they went around the track at speeds of 50 miles (80 kilometres) per hour, the motorists switched on the smart cruise control and lane assist features, which allowed the cars to drive the 6.4-mile (10.3km) circuit unaided. At this point, a large lorry with a flatbed drove alongside and four of the stuntmen climbed out through the roofs, and jumped unaided onto the back of the HGV. Only the driver at the front of the convoy stayed in the car, knowing there were four cars travelling behind him with no-one at the wheel. He then crossed his arms, with the lorry pulling up in front and slamming on the brakes. The Hyundai's automatic emergency braking system immediately kicked in and the car came to a standstill before it could smash into the truck. The remaining driver, who was in the lead car of the five-strong convoy behind the lorry, put on a blindfold and let the driverless technology in the car take the wheel - and the pedals . The lorry at the front of the procession than braked heavily and the driverless technology reacted - the convoy of Hyundai cars automatically responded and stopped safely with the blindfolded driver. Pictured is the moment the blindfolded motorist relied on auto braking to stop his car smashing into the lorry . The Lane Keeping Assist System enables the cars to stay within the white lines of the road without any input from the driver, and it also monitor's the car's speed and watches out for obstacles as well . The four driverless cars behind also slammed the brakes on - preventing a serious accident. Hyundai's 'Empty Car Convoy' was shot in California by London-based creative agency The Viral Factory, with Top Gear director Kit Lynch Robinson. Ed Robinson, creative director, said: ‘As we watched the stunt men jump from their cars, leaving the empty car convoy speeding around the track, we nervously realised what an insane idea it was. ‘Happily the cars did exactly what Hyundai promised they could and all drivers and vehicles came out unscathed. A team of five stuntmen each got behind the wheel of a Hyundai Genesis to showcase the Korean car's safety features. Four of them jumped from their car into a flatbed truck (pictured) Before jumping out, the motorists switched on the smart cruise control and lane assist features, which allowed the cars to drive the 6.4-mile (10.3km) circuit unaided .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . and Sarah Gordon . The French air traffic strike, that ground Europe to a halt, causing hundreds of flight cancellations and stranding tens of thousands of holidaymakers, has finally been called off. Hundreds of flights to France, Spain and Portugal were grounded as peak holiday season kicked off, due to the closure of French airspace, causing huge delays across Europe and leaving airports overflowing. But after two days of the six-day strike, air traffic controllers said they would end the industrial action early because the French government had recognised the 'importance of investment in the sector'. Delays: Passengers at Stansted Airport faced delays as striking French air traffic controllers caused chaos across Europe, causing delays and cancellations for flights to France, Spain and Portugal . The news comes after many holidaymakers were forced to sleep on the floors of . airports in Mediterranean resorts as they awaited news of rescheduled . flights. British passengers reported 'nightmare' scenes at popular holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal as flights were cancelled with no warning, due to French airspace being closed. Frustrated travellers took to Twitter to vent their anger, with passengers claiming they were not given enough help by airlines when their flights were cancelled. Aileen O'Toole complained that her daughter was charged £144 when she tried to rebook a flight to Malaga that had been cancelled due to the strike - despite Ryanair claiming passengers could rebook 'free of charge'. The budget airline has now confirmed that a refund has been issued. Complaints: Passengers - and their mothers - took to Twitter as flight chaos ensued across Europe . In agreement: Abby Benson voiced opinions very similar to those expressed by Ryanair . Other passengers also complained about their treatment at the hands of airlines. Abby Benson said her daughter had been sat in a plane on the tarmac from 9pm, with a 4.30am take-off expected, but that there was no water being offered to passengers. Ryanair and easyJet, who had first predicted 'dozens' of cancellations on day one of the strike, were forced to ground 260 and 150 flights respectively yesterday. And . to add further misery to the European travel chaos, Belgian air traffic . controllers also joined the French walkout before the industrial action was called off. Long wait: Thousands of travellers are now waiting to hear when they will be able to make their journeys after the six-day strike was cut short . Passengers, who have already . experienced days of delays, are now waiting to hear whether they will be . able to return home or head off on holiday now that the strike has . ended. Student Ellis Palmer has already spent more than 24 hours attempting to get to Barcelona for a university course. The . 19-year-old initially had a flight from Liverpool cancelled, before . being sent to Manchester for an alternative flight where he sat on the . runway for 90 minutes before being told to disembark. Ellis told MailOnline Travel: ‘Ryanair have rebooked my flight for a third time now.' EasyJet, which cancelled 300 . flights over two days, said it had booked 2,800 hotel rooms to deal with . passengers unable to fly home. And British Airways cancelled 30 flights in total. Kenny . Jacobs, marketing chief at Ryanair, had accused to French air traffic . controllers of holding holidaymakers to ransom and said EU governments . needed to get . tough on the striking workers. ‘It’s . a disgrace,’ he said. ‘The French need to sort this out. Ronald Reagan . had the right idea when he broke the air traffic controllers’ strike in . the USA by sending in the military to run it. ‘Strike . action by air traffic controllers should be made illegal. And if they . do go on strike, neighbouring EU countries should be able to operate the . airspace over France to keep planes flying.’ Queues at UK airports were less severe . than on Tuesday because airlines had ‘pre-cancelled’ most of the . affected outbound flights overnight and alerted passengers in advance by . text or email.

These postcards are the first color photographs taken of the New World, capturing the majesty of the American landscape, from buzzing city scenes to the dramatic vista of the Grand Canyon. Dating back to the late 19th century and early 20th century – and now compiled in a book entitled An American Odyssey – they show the people and places of the New World, documenting Native Americans, African Americans, immigrants, cowboys and gold rushers. The photographs were taken between 1888 and 1924 and were made into postcards celebrating cities, landscapes and everyday life across the country.

Homestake Mine, South Dakota: These particular images were produced by the Detroit Photographic Company at the turn of the century . Many of the images were produced using a photochrom process, taking black and white negatives and filling them with color by transferring them onto lithographic printing stones. Another process used was photostint, a way of tinting black and white and sepia images which was used by companies - including what was then known as the London Daily Mail - to print color postcards of important events, such as scenes from the First World War. These processes predated the autochrome by nearly 20 years and offered people the very first color photographs of The United States. Suddenly, the continent's colors were available for all to see. The rich ochres and browns of the Grand Canyon, the dazzle of Atlantic City, became a visual delight not only for eyewitnesses, but for Americans far and wide. The Big Apple: Mulberry Street, the main thoroughfare in Manhattan, is brought to life with the photochrom process, showing the varying ethnicity of New Yorkers and a glimpse at their everyday lives . A Mississippi landing, Vicksburg: The colorful photochroms started out as glass negatives such as this . Laundry day: This unusual picture shows a Monday in New York City, when the streets were filled with clean washing being aired among the buildings . Feats of engineering: The Gerogetown Loop over Clear Creek Canyon in Colorado was hugely important to the nearby gold and silver mines at the start of the 20th century . These spectacular postcards are from a private collection amassed by graphic designer, photographer, and collector Marc Walter. He specializes in vintage travel photographs and has one of the world's largest collections. These particular images were produced by the Detroit Photographic Company at the turn of the century, combining landscapes with human interest images for city dwellers, immigrants and even gold rushers and the last Wild West cowboys.

"By . Sarah Gordon . France's reputation for rude service is entirely undeserved, according to new research which reveals the Gallic nation as the most welcoming country in Europe. It might come as a shock to some Britons but when Chinese tourists were asked to name the European country showing the most hospitality to travellers, France came out on top. When looking at the most hospitable countries in the world, Australia topped the list, followed by Singapore, with France and New Zealand equal third. Romantic hotspot: Chinese travellers ranked France as the friendliest country in Europe and third-friendliest in the world . In comparison, the UK only ranked in joint 10th place with Germany among the friendliest nations in Europe, according to big-spending Chinese tourists. France also beat the UK, and other European countries, on a list of places Chinese travellers would like to go to and also to which they have been, according to the latest statistics from Hotels.com. The positive news for France comes just weeks after ministers said the nation had to be friendlier to tourists if it wanted to keep attracting them to its shores. Speaking about how to attract 100 million tourists to France, finance minister Laurent Fabius echoed her sentiment, saying: 'The logic is simple, an unhappy tourist is a tourist that never comes back.' When asked to name their wish-list destinations, Chinese travellers put Australia at the top, with France second and New Zealand third. The UK was seventh. The country the Chinese had visited most was the US, with France fifth and the UK sixth. Top spot: Australia was voted the most hospitable nation in the world by Chinese travellers . Of the destinations searched for by Chinese travellers on Hotels.com in the first five months of this year, Hong Kong was top, with Paris ninth and London 13th. The French and the UK capitals were the only European destinations in the top 20 in this category. The Chinese were the biggest spenders on hotel accommodation in Australia, Japan, Holland and New Zealand last year. In France they were the third-biggest spenders, while in the UK they were the eighth-biggest. Hotels.com said by 2017 it is predicted that Chinese tourists will spend £1 billion in the UK, an increase of 84 per cent compared with 2013 figures. London calling: The UK ranks behind France for friendliness and also on Chinese tourists' list of places they want to go . Matt Walls of Hotels.com said: 'Chinese travellers appear to be prioritising destinations that are most welcoming to them. In Europe we are seeing France win out against other countries as a result of its efforts to make it easier for Chinese people to visit. 'Until recently, the UK's visa processes have acted as a deterrent to many Chinese visitors due to their complexity. However, the reforms announced recently should make a considerable difference. 'he sooner these changes are introduced, the sooner UK businesses can benefit from the upsurge in international travel by the Chinese.' A total of 3,000 Chinese international travellers and 3,000 worldwide hoteliers were surveyed.","France ranked third in the world in poll of friendliest nations .

"By . Carol Driver . and Sarah Gordon . Unlimited free alcohol, sex competitions, and 'causing carnage', this is how one of Magaluf's most controversial events companies keeps young holidaymakers entertained. Following the release of shocking footage in which a 18-year-old woman performs a sex act on 24 men at a bar in Majorca, the firm that hosted the 'out-of-control' party can be revealed. Carnage Magalluf advertises on its website that it offers travellers pool parties, bar crawls and nine-hour club nights, with 'wild drinking games', free shots - and even celebrity hosts - for prices starting from just £25.

It is especially popular with British tourists (file picture) Controversial: Carnage Magalluf offers free alcohol and 'wild parties' at the events it runs on the Spanish island . The company, which has been running for two years, claims it has 'moved straight to the top because of our services and quality of events' - and even brags that it has guest appearances from the likes of actor Danny Dyer, TOWIE stars Dan Osborne and James 'Arg' Argent, and Benefits Street's White Dee. However, since the alarming two-minute footage came to light on Wednesday, giving an insight into the type of events Carnage Magalluf runs, more disturbing details have emerged that will no doubt concern the parents of children planning to attend its parties over the summer holidays. On its Twitter feed, the company brags about its all-you-can drink bar crawls, naming and 'shaming' the 'weak' revellers who fail to make it to the end of the night.

Another . video posted by the business on its Facebook page shows a montage of . what goes on at the parties it arranges - including scenes of sex acts . being carried out by men and women.

Bragging: The company's first response on Twitter after the sex act video was posted online . The man behind the camera praises the 'lad', saying that the company has been: 'Making virgins non-virgins for the past four years.' After . the footage of the sex act video was leaked online, the company appeared to revel in its infamy, . tweeting: 'If you want to get involved in any of our events you best get . ya tickets now as sales are goin through the roof..' It . also retweeted a host of offensive posts by supporters of the company, . including an obscene remark by user @ConnorFairbairn alleging that he was in . Magaluf at the same time as the girl in the video and her friends, . adding: 'that made our holiday loooool non stop scenes.' On Friday night, the company attempted to distance itself from the sex act video after outrage and a huge online backlash. It tweeted: 'We are not responsible for the girls actions. The girl and her 8 friends bought tickets for the next BARCRAWL as they said it was AMAZING!' It added in a second post: 'All you need to do is look at the video and you can see she clearly isn't drunk and knows what she is doin. Definitely not forced in any way.' However, Twitter users were swift to attack Carnage Magalluf's stance, with one user tweeting: 'Hasn't stopped you RTing abuse towards her or revelling in the coverage though, has it? Pathetic.' Another asked: 'Why are you re-tweeting the abuse?' While another said: 'Virtually no one's questioning the actions of the 24 blokes involved, funny that.' The company distanced itself from the girl's actions in the video in a Twitter comment . Carnage Magalluf also denied allegations the girl involved in the sex act video was drunk at its event . Footage of . the girl's actions was posted online on Wednesday and quickly went . viral, sparking outrage among politicians and women's rights groups. A . man called Kieran, 26, who said he was at the club at the time, said . the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party . organisers she would win a 'holiday'. But . her prize, in fact, reportedly turned out to be a cocktail named . 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur . and fruit juice. 'It was a . game that got completely out of hand,' Kieran told The Sun. 'The girl . was being encouraged to drink more and more and was told she would win a . ""holiday"" if she took part in this game. 'Unfortunately the ""holiday"" turned out to be the name of a cocktail.' Police have now launched an inquiry into the incident, which took place during an event organised by Carnage Magalluf at Alex's Bar. In the video, the men involved in the sex acts can be seen sporting T-shirts from Carnage Magalluf. Several holidaymakers are captured taking photos of the 'game' on their mobile phones. Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take part in the game, told the Mirror the girl had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture. 'This girl's gone on holiday, got fuelled with alcohol, someone's suggested it, she's smashed and thought it's a good idea,' he said. The reality TV star was reportedly asked whether he wanted to be 'number 25', but declined, sticking his middle finger up at the girl who then walked away. The company had already provoked controversy after hosting Benefits Street's White Dee - real name Deirdre Kelly - at a number of its events on the Spanish party island. It caused outrage as Dee, who currently receives £10,000 a year in state handouts, as she claims she is too depressed to work. MailOnline has contacted Carnage Magalluf for comment.","Promotes itself using video which includes montage of public sex acts .

"By . Caroline Graham . Gordon Ramsay has revealed that his wife Tana ordered him to lose weight – because he was so chubby he could not see the bottom half of his body. The 6ft 2in chef told how he embarked on a year-long fitness regime and slimmed down from a peak of 16st to 14 after Mrs Ramsay made him stand on the scales. The 47-year-old told America’s Entertainment Tonight talk show: ‘Tana advised me I was putting on weight and she wanted me to get out of bed every morning and stand up and be able to look at my meat and two veg. The 6ft 2in celebrity chef has slimmed down from 16 stone to 14 stone after embarking on a year-long fitness regime. Pictured: Gordon with his wife Tana at the Virgin London Marathon in 2012, before his weight loss . ‘I’ve now got my six-pack back. It’s gone from two to four to six. She put me on a strict diet. Every day she made me stand on those scales. ‘She closed our kitchen down and turned it into a utility room. That’s like your wife driving your car every day and burning the clutch. 'The fridge was empty then. Now the fridge is full of coconut water.’ Gordon looked noticeably slimmer when spotted dining out with wife Tana in Los Angeles last week . The Ramsays, who are best friends with Victoria and David Beckham and have been spotted twice in the past week dining out in Los Angeles, now follow a low-fat diet at home, favouring protein-rich dishes such as poached fish and grilled chicken. Ramsay has also been working out with personal trainers in London and Los Angeles and recently competed in a triathlon and Iron Man contest. Mrs Ramsay, who is due to appear on his US MasterChef programme, joked: ‘I gently mentioned that maybe he was getting a little bit rounded. I didn’t put him on a diet.’ She also said her notoriously foul-mouthed husband of 18 years is a ‘pushover’ with their four children especially with daughters Megan, 14, and Matilda, 12, known as Tilly. She said: ‘Anything I say isn’t suitable, like high heels, wedges, they ask Gordon and he always says yes.’ Tilly, 12, is set to follow in her father’s footsteps by fronting her own cookery show on children’s channel CBBC. ‘Tilly’s a very good cook,’ said Ramsay.","The 47-year-old celebrity chef said his wife Tana ordered him to lose weight .

"By . Darren Boyle . This dramatic footage captured the moment a stuntman leapt from a bridge onto a speeding train below - and miraculously survived. In the 43-second clip, the daredevil, known as Mister Puma, is seen lying face-down on a rooftop before springing to his feet, crouching and preparing to jump. As a train exits  the tunnel underneath at speed, the 38-year-old full-time stuntman takes a brief run-up before throwing himself off the roof and landing on top of the speeding train. Mister Puma, pictured,  said he intends repeating his death-defying stunt on the Paris Metro in the near future . The stuntman lay prone over the exit of the tunnel before leaping onto the roof of the speeding train . While he initially lands on his feet, the speed of the train throws him backwards. The video then cuts to a busy street, where the stuntman is seen jogging towards the camera, before leaping upwards and punching the air, smiling, and saluting the camera. The stunt took place a week ago in Paris, and Mister Puma stayed on top of the train until the next station. He said: 'It did not exactly go to plan but I am still alive. 'There are still some things to improve, it has to be done again.' Parisian Mister Puma told how he started stunts, acrobatics and martial arts when he was 16, trained by expert Sylvain Durand. He planned this stunt for 'several months', adding: 'I knew I could do it and I took all the risks into consideration. 'So the only real risk was to make sure not to arrive directly between the wagons due to the edge. 'Sometimes I need to prove to myself I can do it. 'Before making a challenge, I have a lot of fear, I see myself falling and die in several ways. 'But I know that in reality it will be much less scary. And if I do not feel it, I do not do it. 'Then comes the satisfaction of having accomplished and overcome the fears. 'Some people see me crazy but I'm a stuntman, so I do stunts.' Mister Puma - who got his name from the 'iconic figure that represents his style' due to the resemblance to a Puma when he jumps, added: 'My next challenge? A holiday.' The footage was filmed by Mister Puma's friend Aurore Tome along with Michel Girard. Mister Puma said he spent several months planning the stunt even though he thought he might die . Mister Puma's Facebook profile describes him as an 'Animal Urbain...' who is 'passionate about martial arts', having taken up karate aged 15 and training in martial arts and acrobatics. The video was posted on his official Facebook page, which has more than 1,100 likes, where his cover photo shows the moment he leapt onto the train, and his profile picture appears to show him perched between train carriages with his arms folded, with the train track visible below. Other pictures on his Facebook profile show Mister Puma appearing to free-run across rooftops. He can also be seen performing gymnastics - holding himself vertically upright with just his arms as he grips onto railings on the edge of buildings.","Daredevil Mister Puma dropped onto the roof of the speeding train in Paris .

"By . Caroline Graham . Peter Sellers's daughter has revealed how a visit to a psychic persuaded her to forgive the comedian after he apologised for excluding her from his will. When the Pink Panther and Goons star died of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54, he left the bulk of his £5.5million fortune to his fourth wife, Lynne Frederick, whom Victoria ‘loathed’ and Sellers was divorcing.

When the Pink Panther and Goons star died of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54, he left Victoria, his only child just £800 . The actor’s estate, valued at £20million today, ended up going to Frederick’s young daughter, Cassie Unger, the product of a later marriage to Californian heart doctor Barry Unger, after her mother drank herself to death in 1994. It was only after Victoria, 49, visited a psychic last November that she came to terms with her father’s decision. ‘What happened was so profound I couldn’t ignore it,’ she said. ‘The guy didn’t know who I was. I went there with a folder, which I kept closed, which had a picture of  me, Dad, my Swedish grandma and a couple of letters from my father written on his favourite Gucci notepaper.

"By . Caroline Graham . and Claudia  Joseph . The blood which stained his white cotton shirt may have faded from vibrant red to black, but Dr Robert McClelland’s memories of the day President John F. Kennedy was shot remain indelible – especially the heartbreaking sight of the First Lady saying her final goodbyes to her husband. Dr McClelland is one of only two doctors still alive who battled to save the President after he suffered terrible gunshot injuries in Dallas on November 22, 1963. ‘It was horrifying to see President Kennedy lying on his back on the stretcher with the operating room light shining down on his bloody head,’ recalls Dr McClelland, now 84. Fateful day: President John F Kennedy and First Lady Jackie Kennedy ride in the President's motorcade through Dallas on November 22, 1963 . ‘I can still see that in my mind’s eye as if it happened today. His face was greyish, his eyes were open and his head was covered in blood. I didn’t have time to put on gloves or scrubs. I operated with my bare hands.’ Dr McClelland had raced to Trauma Room One at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas after hearing the terrible news that the President’s motorcade had been attacked. He recalls how, as he pushed through the crowds of police officers, Secret Service agents and hospital staff, he saw the President’s wife Jackie sitting on a chair outside the operating theatre, her pink Chanel wool suit covered in blood. Once inside the theatre, Dr McClelland was joined by Dr Kenneth Salyer, then a junior surgeon. Dr Salyer went on to be one of the world’s leading craniofacial specialists. In his newly released autobiography, A Life That Matters, Dr Salyer says the priority was to get the President breathing by inserting a tube down his throat and into his lungs. ‘The whole right-hand side of President Kennedy’s cranium had been blown away,’ he remembers. Fatal journey: President John F Kennedy, and Jackie pictured with John Connally, Governor of Texas, and his wife Nellie, the day before the assassination . Taking over: Lyndon B. Johnson is sworn in as President of the United States in the cabin of the presidential plane as Jacqueline Kennedy stands at his side just hours after the assassination . ‘Much of the right side of his brain had been destroyed as well, and the remainder was exposed by a gaping hole in his skull. ‘The team wasn’t having any success at getting a tube down through the President’s nose, so we focused instead on a small bullet wound in the President’s neck, through which he was sucking air. ‘By enlarging the size of the wound, we ultimately were able to insert a breathing tube into the President’s lung. Although none of us spoke about it, it was already certain to each of us that anything more we might do to assist the President would be in vain. ‘The injury was absolutely a fatal one, yet although his brain had been devastated, his heart was still beating, and his body continued to reflexively gasp for breath. ‘Our patient was fatally wounded, but he was also the President of the United States, and we were obligated to try every heroic procedure imaginable to save him.’ It was, adds Dr Salyer, a disastrous irony that the President’s bravery as a pilot during the Second World War, and the wounds he suffered then, had quite possibly sealed his fate. ‘We began to cut away the President’s clothes, and I remember my surprise at the size and thickness of the massive brace he wore around his chest and abdomen. ‘I knew the President had suffered a back injury during his service in the Second World War, but the brace was far more restrictive than anything I could have envisioned. ‘As I cut away the brace, which was tightly laced like a corset, with heavy shears, it was hard to imagine he could move while wearing it, and it seemed certain that the war injury was far more serious – and painful – than the public knew. ‘The brace had kept his body upright and out in the open which meant he was a target for subsequent shots. Had he not been wearing it he might have survived.’ In contrast, Texas governor John Connally, who was seated in the same limousine as the President that day in November 1963, slumped to the floor after a bullet hit him and survived. The medical team put an intravenous line into the President’s right arm, gave him ‘massive amounts of blood’, massaged his heart, injected him with steroids (he suffered from Addison’s disease, a rare disorder of the adrenal glands) and inserted chest tubes, but nothing improved his condition. ‘We worked intensely, suggesting to one another anything we might still try, but each of us knew that all hope was lost,’ says Dr Salyer. Doctors worked on the President for 12 minutes but the signal on his heart monitor remained flat. During that time Mrs Kennedy wandered in and out of the room. ‘She continued to stand erect and without assistance, her face expressing both her shock and her profound sorrow,’ says Dr Salyer. At 1pm, after every monitor attached to the President’s body  had flatlined, Dr Kemp Clark, the hospital’s chief of neurosurgery, announced in a ‘calm yet shaken voice’: ‘Gentlemen, President Kennedy has died.’ The room emptied, but Dr Salyer remained at the head of the operating table as both the First Lady and a priest approached the body. ‘As I stood at the table, Mrs Kennedy approached it, and I remember her looking at me as if [to ask] that was OK. I nodded and watched as she moved close to the President’s body. ‘She leaned across him to reach for his left hand, removed his wedding ring and placed it on one of her fingers, and then she simply held her husband’s hand in a final goodbye. ‘I was still standing beside the table, numb and disbelieving, when a few men entered the room with a wooden casket, placed the President’s body inside it, then carried him away.’ Dr McClelland recalls that moment  slightly differently, suggesting that as well as taking her husband’s ring, Jackie Kennedy also placed her own ring on his hand. ‘She was very self-contained, not crying or hysterical or anything like that. ‘She stood there very dignified, very quiet, and walked slowly down to the end of the gurney where the President’s bare right foot was protruding out from the sheet that he was covered with. ‘She stood there for a moment, leaned over and kissed his foot, then walked out of the room. That was the last we saw of her.’ Dr McClelland’s suit, covered with the President’s blood, was sent to a dry cleaner by his wife. But he kept the stained white shirt from that day as it was – ‘to always remember’. Additional reporting by  Daniel Bates .","Dr Robert McClelland treated President John F.

"By . Caroline Graham . New dad: Simon Cowell arrives at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York this afternoon, posing for pictures . Simon Cowell wept when he was handed his newborn son on Valentine’s Day, it was revealed last night. The X Factor supremo is said to be ‘delirious with joy’ after the birth of 6lb 7oz Eric Philip, who he greeted with the words: ‘I’ve waited all my life for you.’ A close friend of 54-year-old Cowell, who has chosen ex- girlfriend Sinitta to be the child’s godmother, said: ‘Simon was much more emotional than  he expected. ‘He was in tears as he watched the birth and broke down when Eric was handed to him. ‘It was such an incredible and emotional day. ‘Simon was by his girlfriend Lauren’s side the entire time. He’s besotted by the baby. ‘He told him, ‘‘I’ve waited all my life for you.’’ He said it was the best day of his life. He hasn’t stopped smiling. ‘When he finally left the hospital he went and celebrated with a Corona and a burger.’ Eric Philip, named after Cowell’s late father and his best friend, Topshop billionaire Sir Philip Green, was born at 5.45pm New York time (10.45pm GMT) on Friday, 17 hours after Lauren Silverman went into labour. The source added: ‘The baby was handed to Lauren and then to Simon. The first call he made was to his mum.’ Sinitta, who has known Cowell since the 1980s, said she was ‘thrilled and honoured’ to have been chosen as godmother. Green and hypnotist Paul  McKenna are also expected to be godparents. Cowell announced the news on Twitter, saying: ‘Very happy to say Eric was born at 17.45pm. Healthy and handsome. Named after my dad. Lauren in great shape. Cowell tweeted the news mere hours after his son was born, confirming the child's name and the fact that mum and baby were doing fine .

"By . Caroline Graham . Wallowing in the crystal clear water of a luxury hotel pool he could have been any holidaymaker enjoying a welcome respite from the relentless British weather. However, this was no ordinary tourist, but Shadow Floods Minister Barry Gardiner. And as he slapped on the sunscreen and adjusted his Panama hat, he seemed to have not a care in the world. He enjoyed romantic walks along the beach with Caroline, his wife of 35 years, and delicious meals at Cancun’s Moon Palace resort, including an all-you-can-eat buffet offering chilled lobster and a beachside seafood diner. Shadow Floods Minister Barry Gardiner and his wife Caroline spent last week at Cancun's Moon Palace Resort on an all-expenses paid trip to deliver one talk at a conference for chemists . Earlier in the week, he wore an Indian-style shirt to celebrate ‘Bollywood Night’ and donned a tuxedo for a glittering black tie gala dinner. The Gardiners were guests of Sigma boss and Labour party supporter Bharat Shah, who transformed his family-owned drug distributor into a multi-national company with an annual turnover of £206 million. They stayed at the Sunrise Hotel in room 1945, a £325-a-night suite complete with a sunken jacuzzi overlooking a lush garden filled with palms and bougainvillea. The Gardiners were among 460 delegates – mostly from the UK  – at the resort which is described  as ‘the most magnificent in all of Mexico’. On Friday, as the temperature topped 85F (29C) in the shade, the Gardiners hit the pool. The MP wore a colourful Hawaiian-print shirt with blue floral swimming shorts incongruously paired with brown lace-up leather shoes. A Panama hat completed the look. Mr and Mrs Gardiner enjoyed days lounging by the various pools at the luxury resort, and long walks on the hotel's six-mile private beach . He and Caroline circled the pool before choosing two orange  sun-loungers nestled under a ‘palapa’ – a sunshade made from dried palm fronds. Caroline leapt enthusiastically into the pool to join a water aerobics class while her husband smiled and tapped his feet to the music as he gazed appreciatively at the bikini-clad bathers around him. After reading his Kindle he stripped off his top and waded out into the main pool. He occasionally submerged himself and did a few breast-strokes, but mostly wallowed in the pristine water, closing his eyes at one stage and leaning back to soak up the sun. A spot of lunch at the beachside fish restaurant was followed by a stroll along the sand with Caroline before they returned to their  sun-loungers for the afternoon. On Wednesday it was ‘Bollywood Night’ where the Gardiners tucked into a vegetarian buffet while Indian zither music played. A witness said: ‘Everyone was dancing and having a great time.’ On Thursday delegates enjoyed day trips to nearby Mayan ruins. The Moon Palace resort occupies a six-mile stretch of pristine sandy beach overlooking the Caribbean. There is a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course, dozens of pools and more than two dozen restaurants. Each room is equipped with a free minibar offering full-sized bottles of vodka, rum, whisky and tequila. The Sigma conference is all-inclusive and Gardiner wore a blue plastic wrist-band which also allowed him access to the spa, horseback riding and even the chance to swim with dolphins. Ed Miliband's 'special envoy on climate change' is pictured relaxing with his wife Caroline by one of the luxury resort's pools . The Moon Palace Resort is described as 'the most magnificent in Mexico' boasts several pools, two dozen restaurants, a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course and views across the Caribbean. The Gardiner's £325-a-night suite featured a sunken jacuzzi and lush garden as well as a free minibar . One resort employee said: ‘Everything is included, all the food and booze. 'The tequila has been flowing all night in the bars and we can tell who the English are because they are the ones who sit in the sun all day long and turn pink.’ A gentle ten-minute shower of rain caused consternation among the British. One said: ‘Ugh, I came here to get away from this.’ Most delegates arrived last Saturday and were given Sunday as a ‘leisure day’ to recover from  jet-lag. The conference – which was also attended by fellow Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron, former chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee – opened on Monday. A delegate said few attendees bothered to go to the convention centre, which adjoins the Sunrise Hotel, at all. He said: ‘This is about having a good time and networking. No one bothers with the lectures. You have to show your face over there at least once but most of the time the lecture hall is empty. ‘Business is done over drinks at the pool or cocktails in the evening. It’s a schmoozefest. We’re all chemists and this conference is something we look forward to every year. One year it was in China, another year at Phuket in Thailand, but Cancun is best of the lot because the weather is so awful back home.’ The couple donned Indian-style shirts to attend the hotel's Bollywood night . When asked what Mr Gardiner’s speech was like on Tuesday, the  man replied: ‘I have no idea. I fell asleep. It was very boring.’ Another delegate said: ‘I’ve put on half a stone. There’s nothing to do but eat, sleep and eat some more.’ When The Mail on Sunday approached Mr Gardiner in Cancun on Friday and asked why he was there instead of offering advice on floods in the UK, he said: ‘Very simply, I was asked to give a speech on waste and it’s parliamentary recess.’ Asked if he had considered cancelling the trip because of the crisis back home, he said: ‘I’ve given my reply, thank you.’ Pressed on who was paying for his trip, he replied: ‘You will see that in the [Commons] Register of Members’ Interests.’ Asked to explain his connection to Sigma and the pharmaceutical industry, he replied abruptly: ‘I’ve just told you. I was asked to give a speech on waste. I’ve done that. Thank you very much. I’m on parliamentary recess, OK?’ Mr Gardiner declined to answer further questions.","Shadow Floods Minister Barry Gardiner enjoyed a stay at Cancun's Moon Palace Resort described as 'the most magnificent in all of Mexico'

"By . Caroline Graham . and Patrick Strudwick . Cold: Marlene Dietrich with her grandson David Riva. He said she was emotionally distant . She was a Hollywood icon, a bisexual beauty whose style and intoxicating sex appeal endured through the ages. But Marlene Dietrich was also a cruel woman who did nothing to protect her own daughter from sexual assault by a lesbian nanny, her grandson claimed last night. Speaking about an auction of her possessions, grandson David Riva, 53, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She was cold and emotionally detached. She wasn’t a conventional granny.’ The German-born star of The Blue Angel and Judgement At Nuremberg was an alcoholic and bulimic who cheated on long-suffering Rudi Sieber throughout their 52-year marriage with both men and women. Her lovers included John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Frank Sinatra, Greta Garbo and Edith Piaf. David said: ‘She slept with anyone she found attractive. But it wasn’t the physical side of sex that mattered. For her, intimacy was about power. ‘One night my mother got a frantic call and raced over. Marlene ushered her to her bedroom. The bed was rumpled and covered in make-up. 'She’d slept with Yul Brynner, who was acting in The King And I. She just wanted to show off her conquest.’ David’s mother Maria, now 89, was Dietrich’s only child. She wrote a biography of her mother in which she revealed the legend would refer to her as ‘The Child’ and never showed her maternal love. Dietrich hired a lesbian nanny who raped Maria at 13. When Maria confronted Marlene about it later, the diva sneered at her: ‘Well, you’re over it now, aren’t you? You’re not dead. Deal with it.’ Relationship: Marlene Dietrich and her daughter Maria Riva in 1944 (left) and in the 1930 romance Morocco . Woman about town: Marlene Dietrich sharing a cigarette with the German author Erich Maria Remarque in 1939 . Sex symbol: Marlene Dietrich had affairs with both men and women during her 52-year marriage . Dietrich was also obsessed with cleanliness: ‘The first thing she would do in a hotel room, even the Ritz, would be to get on her knees and scrub the bathroom,’ David said. David, who was his grandmother’s agent, told how her last years were spent miserably in her Paris flat, drinking and popping pills: ‘She was one of those alcoholics that doesn’t appear drunk. The star in publicity for Rancho Notorious (1952) ‘She loved food but was bulimic. That was her solution. Enjoy food and then throw it up, why not?’ One of his earliest memories is of Dietrich using tape behind her ears  to give herself a facelift. ‘She didn’t leave her apartment for her last 15 years. She was offered an Oscar if she’d collect it in person but turned it down. ‘She hadn’t spent 60 years creating an image for it to be destroyed by photos of her ageing.’ When a paparazzo climbed up to snap a picture through her window she shot at him with a starting pistol she kept under her bed. But David said his grandmother also had a ‘quietly heroic’ side. Dietrich enraged Hitler by becoming a US citizen and entertained US troops at the front line with hits like ‘Lili Marlene’. She won America’s highest civilian honour, the Medal of Freedom, and disowned her sister when she discovered she ran a cinema catering to guards at the notorious Bergen-Belsen death camp. David said: ‘To her, the GIs were “her boys”. Her wartime work was what she was most proud of.’ Dietrich died in 1992 aged 90 and in debt (‘she lived large and hadn’t earned money for years’). The German government bought most of her possessions, which are exhibited in a Berlin museum in her honour. Her family are selling the remainder. Items including one of Marlene’s tuxedos, crystal cigarette lighters and a letter from the novelist Ernest Hemingway in which he refers to her as ‘Dearest Kraut’ and fantasizes about cavorting naked on stage with her will be sold at auctionmystuff.com from March 19 to April 6.

"By . Caroline Graham . Great pretender: Bestselling Bridget Jones's Diary author Helen Fielding set up fake online dating profiles as research for her latest book . Her much-loved creation Bridget Jones is famously unlucky in love – but author Helen Fielding has discovered the formula for dating success: being a ‘bitch’. The bestselling writer has revealed that she set up fake profiles on internet dating sites – and found that a nastier persona attracted more male interest. As research for her latest book, Fielding set up two accounts: one featuring a photograph of a woman in a sensible sweater who loved to read and cook; the other called ‘SuperLuckyBitch’ who had a sexy photograph and a description which ‘portrayed her as a real bitch’. Fielding revealed: ‘So I had SuperLuckyBitch who was glamorous but really horrible and it said on her profile, “You’d be lucky to get a date with me”, and the other woman was really nice and sweet. ‘Well, I bet you can guess who was the most popular. SuperLuckyBitch got all the replies.’ The 55-year-old author was speaking about Mad About The Boy, the third book in the Bridget Jones series, at an event in Los Angeles hosted by her friend, the Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher. When Fisher asked Fielding – who split from former partner Kevin Curran in 2009 – if she had gone on dates with any of the men her fake profiles attracted, she laughed: ‘I did see one person but he realised that I was a writer and guessed who I was. I went and met him and explained I was doing research and he was very nice about it.’ The writer admitted to sharing Bridget’s obsessive streak, which saw her counting every calorie she consumed and documenting her weight daily. She also became so addicted to Twitter that the social nework cut her off after she checked her own profile 150 times in one hour. She explained: ‘I had to stop with the Twitter. It is a bit of a giant popularity contest. I think I got [blocked] as I checked how many followers I had too many times.’ Fielding revealed many similarities between herself and Bridget during the 90-minute talk, including  a disorganised approach to work. She said she spends hours ‘faffing about’ before starting work – and often makes Bridget-style gaffes. ‘I was due to have my daughter by C-section at Cedars Sinai so I wrote out this mass email to everyone announcing the birth as it was all planned, but I sent out the email by mistake beforehand. Then I had to let everyone know that I hadn’t even had the baby yet,’ she said. ‘I don’t have a routine for writing. Instead I spend hours going to the fridge or cleaning out the cupboards. I spend a lot of time faffing about, then it’s time to pick the kids up from school.  I do a lot of late-night writing – and then I just steal the plot from Jane Austen,’ she joked. Romcom: Hugh Grant and Renee Zellweger in the Bridget Jones film. Fielding revealed many similarities between herself and Bridget during the 90-minute talk, including  a disorganised approach to work . She said that initially, she didn’t intend her latest book – which covers topics such as dating  among 50-somethings – to be about Bridget Jones, but ‘along the way I realised it needed to be Bridget’. She said: ‘It took me about three months to become Bridget again. It was easier to write it because I was in London. There’s no way I could’ve written it if I was still living in LA. I never told anyone that I was doing a new Bridget book. I wanted to get it written without anyone else’s input.’ She hasn’t ruled another Bridget Jones book, but  said: ‘I don’t know if I’ll bring Bridget back again at 61 or 65. I wouldn’t want to do it just for the sake of doing it. I’d only do it if I had something to say.’","She set up two online dating profiles as research for her latest book .

Nigella Lawson has ditched the gloomy black clothes she has worn since her split from husband Charles Saatchi in favour of a figure-hugging fuchsia dress. The 53-year-old, who divorced the art tycoon in July, looked radiant as she attended a party in Los Angeles in the £95 dress, which was made especially for her by a British designer. Accessorising with a flower crown and garland, the chef posed for a photo with her make-up artist Tricia Woolston as they celebrated the end of filming for her US cookery show The Taste. Nigella appears as a star judge on the series, which has become a prime-time hit for American TV network ABC. She is rumoured to have been paid £500,000 to executive produce and appear in the second series. A source said: ‘Nigella is looking better than ever. She’s smiling and laughing again. She thoroughly enjoyed her time in LA. She has been working exceptionally hard but she’s been surrounded by close friends and seems to be in great form.’ Nigella, who flew back to London on Friday, is due to start filming The Taste UK for Channel 4 tomorrow. Both the US and UK versions of the show will air early next year. A spokesman for Kent-based The Pretty Dress Company, which designed Nigella’s dress, said last night: ‘Nigella loves our dresses. We made the shocking pink dress especially for her. It’s not available to the public right now but it will be shortly.’ Nigella split from Saatchi, 70, after he was photographed grabbing her throat outside aMayfair restaurant in June.

"By . Chris Hastings . and Chris Pleasance . Mike Smith, the former BBC Radio 1 DJ and broadcaster, has died at the age of 59. Smith, who was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1980s, died on Friday after complications arising from major heart surgery. The presenter, who had been married to fellow broadcaster Sarah Greene for 25 years, presented Radio 1’s flagship breakfast show between 1986 and 1988. During his two-year tenure on the programme, he was described by Princess Diana as her favourite DJ. Scroll down for audio . Mike Smith, former Radio 1 presenter, has died aged 59 from complications following heart surgery. Smith began at the BBC in 1975 and taking over the breakfast show in 1986 (pictured in 2008, left, and 1984, right) Known for his boyish good looks and affectionately dubbed ‘Smitty’, Smith also proved popular with TV audiences and was a regular on Top of the Pops. In addition, he made frequent appearances on the BBC’s Breakfast Time programme and The Late, Late Breakfast Show, hosted by Noel Edmonds. His experience as a live broadcaster and his knowledge of popular music meant he was an ideal choice as a host of the BBC’s Live Aid broadcast in 1985. He managed to remain cool and calm even when a highly emotional Bob Geldof swore on air as he tried raise more money for African famine relief. Aside from his broadcasting career, Smith was a keen motorsports enthusiast, building his own cars and competing in a racing career that began when he was just 14. Disaster struck in 1988 when Smith, a qualified pilot, and Greene, who was his girlfriend at the time, were injured when the helicopter he was piloting crashed in Gloucestershire. Greene broke both her legs and an arm and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. Smith proposed just weeks later and they were married the following year. Sarah Greene last night asked that she and her family and friends be allowed to mourn in peace. In a statement, she offered enormous thanks to the staff at the hospital in which her husband died for their care and compassion. Smith leaves behind wife Sarah Greene (right). The pair got engaged in 1988 shortly after Smith crashed a helicopter the pair were riding in and married the following year . Mike Smith and his wife of 25 years at an award ceremony . The pair were involved in a helicopter crash in 1988 . Fellow Breakfast Show alumnus Mike Read was among the first to pay tribute to ‘affable, businesslike’ Smith last night. The DJ and television personality said: ‘The news is just devastating. Sarah and Mike were a wonderful couple – it is truly horrible to hear. ‘I knew Mike as there were only five of us to have presented the Breakfast Show at that time. ‘He became a mainstay of Radio 1, was highly successful on television too, and started up his own business, which he was very good at. I worked with Sarah for a number of years, including around the time of the crash, so I was very fond of them both. The helicopter crash was really bad but they just got on with it and married. ‘Mike was a very affable guy, fantastically business-like. It’s a real loss and has come as quite a shock.’ Other friends and colleagues paid tribute on social networking sites such as Twitter. Phillip Schofield, who presented the flagship children’s television show Going Live with Greene, said: ‘There are no words. My wonderful, bright, funny, thoughtful friend Mike Smith has passed. I’m so sorry, my darling Sarah.’ Radio presenter Simon Mayo wrote: ‘Shocked to hear of Mike Smith’s death today. Condolences to Sarah and all his family.’ Simon Mayo, fellow BBC Radio 1 presenter who took over from Smith after he left the breakfast show in 1988, has tweeted his sympathies this evening . Philip Schofield has also taken to social media to pay his respects to Smith who died yesterday in hospital . Keith Chegwin paid tribute to ‘a nice man and a great broadcaster’ who died ‘far too young’. Towards the end of his life Smith concentrated on his career as a pilot and aerial photographer. In 2004 he founded Flying TV, a company set up to provide aerial filming services to broadcasters. He did, however, continue to make occasional appearances on television and radio, and in 2012 he and Greene appeared in an edition of the BBC1 quiz show Pointless. The star was never afraid to speak his mind and recently criticised Radio 1’s music strategy and what he saw as its obsession with youth. He said: ‘They say they’re going for a younger audience – that’s just wrong. Relentlessly chasing youth is going to p*** off more people than it will attract. ‘I don’t know why the BBC is slavishly following demographics invented by advertisers when they don’t take advertising. ‘Chasing demographics is terrible news for listeners.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are saddened to hear of Mike’s passing. He was a talented presenter and a brilliant Radio 1 Breakfast Show host and our thoughts are with his family.’ Mike Smith and wife Sarah Greene in 2008 . Born in Hornchurch, Essex, in 1955, Mike Smith began his presenting career on hospital radio at nearby Chemsford Hospital. In 1975 he moved to the BBC for the first time where he worked as a freelance producer and presenter on Radio 1, before moving to Capital Radio in 1978 where he became a breakfast presenter. He moved back to BBC Radio in 1982 where he presented the early show from 6-7 in the morning until 1983 when he was moved to the lunchtime slot. In 1986 'Smitty' - as he was then known by listeners - took over from Mike Read to present the breakfast show, a role which he held until deciding to leave the company in 1988. Smith went to to present programmes such as That's Showbusiness and Julian Clarey's Trick Or Treat. He was one of BBC TV's presenters at Live Aid in 1985, helped found Comic Relief and presented several of the TV shows. A keen helicopter pilot, Smith had a major accident in 1988 when he crashed a helicopter while future wife Sarah Greene was riding with him. Ms Greene broke both legs and an arm, and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. Despite the accident Smith proposed to Ms Greene just a few weeks later, and the pair got married the following year. In 2003 Smith founded TV production company Flying TV, putting his training as a pilot to good use by providing specialist aerial shots for various shows including BBC coverage of the Boat Race and Formula 1, Top Gear, BBC News, ITV News and Channel 4 News. Smith was also fond of car racing, starting as an amateur while still in school and eventually founding his own team of Ford RS500s, winning the Championship in 1990.","Radio 1 DJ Mike Smith has died  aged 59 of complications from heart surgery .

"By . Chris Hastings . Moors Murderer Myra Hindley did show remorse while in jail – but only for the death of her pet dog, according to a letter published for the first time today. Hindley, who along with her lover Ian Brady was jailed for life for the murders of five children in the 1960s, wrote that the thought of her beloved dog ‘Puppet’ reduced her to tears. In a letter to Brady’s mother Margaret written on Thursday 2 December 1965 she wrote: 'I haven’t yet received the ‘report’ on the dog. They were quick enough to kill him, but are taking their time about giving me the report.' It has been revealed that Myra Hindley was reduced to tears in jail when she learned that her beloved dog Puppet had died . She added: 'However I can’t dwell on this subject for very long, it hurts too much to even think about Puppet without crying.' The 23-year-old who was just four months away from being found guilty of one of the most infamous and sadistic crimes in British legal history does not make any reference to her offences in the letter which was written from her cell at HM Prison Risley. Instead she recalls at length the relationship she and Brady, then 27, shared with their family pets including Mrs Brady’s own dog Bruce. She wrote: “I know you understand how Ian and I feel about this as you thought so much of Bruce, that you know how a dog who is part of the family can mean so much. Ian was terribly upset about Bruce when he died but he wouldn’t show it.” In the handwritten letter which has been obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws Hindley recalls how Puppet and the dog’s mother Lassie could barely contain their excitement when she and Brady returned home from work. She wrote: 'At night when we returned from work, the dogs would hear the car doors slam and Lassie, the devil, would actually jump onto the table under the window, wagging her tail and barking, and Puppet would run in the hall, stand on the 3rd (sic) stair and stick his nose through the letter box. As soon as we’d opened the door, he’d fly to Ian, nearly knocking him over and then run for his stick (which Ian made specially for him) and drop it at Ian’s feet and would keep picking it up and dropping it until Ian picked it up.' Ian Brady, left, and Myra Hindley, right, who would take various dogs on trips to the countryside in the months leading up to their arrest . Hindley who had been in a relationship with Brady for almost six years also recalls how they would take the various dogs out on trips to the countryside in the months leading up to their arrest. She wrote: 'Puppet could nearly talk, he was such an intelligent dog. It got so that we had to spell the word (walk) ‘out’ if we wanted to say it, for the very mention of the word, he would bark madly and run for his stick. 'Every time I had a photo taken with Bruce, I had to bribe her (Lassie) with Smartie’s. She wouldn’t leave Ian while he just took a photo. She had me scratching her tummy for hours while she lay on Ian’s knee in the back seat. She was a lovely little dog. I used to laugh at her heavy feet they always reminded me of a chicken.' It is impossible to reconcile the couple’s obvious love for the pets with the depravity of their crimes which were committed on and around Saddleworth Moor between 1963 and 1965. The pair who were initially charged with the murder of Edward Evans, Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride and the court heard a tape recording of the ten year old Downey pleading for her life. Brady was found guilty of all three murders and was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences and Hindley who was found guilty of the murder of Evans and Downey was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences. She was sentenced to another seven years for harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed Kilbride. Police search Saddleworth Moor for the bodies of children who were killed by Hindley and Brady . The pair escaped execution because the death sentenced had been abolished while they were on remand. Hindley’s frustration about the police’s failure to hand over the file on her dog’s demise is in stark contrast to how she made the families of other victims wait decades before revealing their fate. Only in 1985 did she and Brady admit their role in the death of two other children Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett. In the letter Hindley bemoans the fact that her former work colleagues are now enjoying the five day week she campaigned for. She said she could ‘kick herself’ for missing out on the concession and finishes off her letter by adding: 'Its just one rotten thing after another. Still, not to worry we’re not dead yet... Love Myra.' Hindley died in 2002 at the age of 60 and Brady, now 76, was declared clinically insane in 1985. He is now a patient at high security Ashworth hospital.","New letter reveals Hindey was reduced to tears when her pet dog died .

"By . Chris Hastings . A 1981 Foreign Office memo which planned for Rudolf Hess’s death referred to ‘packing his body in ice’ and ‘restraining’ the Russians if necessary by the use of British troops . Margaret Thatcher was ready to use British troops against the Russians in a fight for the corpse of Adolf Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess. Foreign Office files obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that Mrs Thatcher’s Government was prepared to risk a ‘frightening’ Cold War showdown in order to ensure the Nazi war criminal’s body was returned to his family after his death. A 1981 Foreign Office memo which planned for Hess’s death referred to ‘packing his body in ice’ and ‘restraining’ the Russians if necessary by the use of British troops. At the time, 87-year-old Hess was the sole inmate in West Berlin’s Spandau Prison, a prisoner of the British, Russians, French and Americans, who took monthly turns to guard him. Hess had been captured by the British in 1941 after he single-handedly flew to Scotland in a bid to strike an unauthorised peace deal with Winston Churchill’s wartime government. He was sent to Spandau in 1947 after being sentenced to life at the Nuremberg war crimes trials. In 1981, British officials believed a clash between British and Russian troops was possible in the then divided city because they no longer supported a Kremlin plan to cremate Hess and return his ashes to his family. Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington was convinced – despite opposition from the Americans – that Hess’s body should be returned to his family for ‘moral and legal reasons’. The document detailed what British officials believed might happen if Hess died during a month when the prison was run by the Russians. It stated: ‘In a Soviet month, the Russians could prevent the body being moved, using their guard troops if need be. ‘In that event, the Allies will seek to have the body placed in the prison cellars (packed with ice to delay decomposition) until the matter is resolved either by negotiation, or by a change of guard at the end of the month. ‘If the Russians try to remove the body from the prison by force, they will be restrained by a detachment of British troops.’ At the time, 87-year-old Hess was the sole inmate in West Berlin’s Spandau Prison, a prisoner of the British, Russians, French and Americans, who took monthly turns to guard him. Pictured above, Russian troops on guard at the jail . Foreign Office files obtained by The Mail on Sunday show Mrs Thatcher’s Government was prepared to risk a ‘frightening’ Cold War showdown to ensure the Nazi’s body was returned to his family after his death . The same document reveals that British officials were prepared to resort to double-bluff in a bid to try to stop the Russians interfering with the transportation of the Deputy Fuhrer’s body by air from Spandau. It states: ‘If the Russians seek to prevent the move... minimum force will be used to restrain them. ‘The possibility of Soviet harassment of the aircraft in the [air] corridors cannot be ruled out. Apart from normal confidentiality in flight planning, it may desirable to adopt diversionary tactics to make it difficult for the Russians to identify which aircraft is carrying the body.’ The possibility seems to have alarmed some Foreign Office officials. One wrote: ‘I doubt whether the action envisaged is realistic.’ But another unidentified official wrote: ‘I can only say that a lot of thought went into the paragraphs in question. They look frightening on paper, but I am confident that the British military can handle the Russians.’ The documents show officials in Washington urged the British to stick to an original 1970 agreement and warned a change of policy might mean ‘the need to use force’. In the event, Hess’s suicide at the age of 93 in August 1987 meant that all plans by the four Allied powers went out of the window. Hess, who hanged himself in the prison’s reading room, was initially buried at a secret location to avoid his grave becoming a shrine for Nazi sympathisers. His body was re-interred at a family plot in Wunsiedel, Germany, in March 1988 and his wife llse was buried alongside him in 1995. But in 2011, his body was exhumed and his grave destroyed precisely because it had become a Neo-Nazi pilgrimage site. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea.","Government was prepared to risk ‘frightening’ Cold War showdown to ensure Nazi’s body was returned to his family after his death .

"By . Chris Hastings . Upheaval: Lord Hall said the Corporation’s channels could soon be replaced by internet catch-up services . For decades we’ve sat down in our millions to watch the most popular TV shows go out at their scheduled time. But the days of the nation viewing Strictly Come Dancing or Call The Midwife together are numbered, says the BBC’s Director General. In a warning to viewers, Lord Hall said the Corporation’s channels could soon be replaced by internet catch-up services. The BBC already puts out some shows solely on its iPlayer service, including a series of films last month starring Meera Syal, Bob Mortimer and Frankie Boyle. BBC Three programmes such as Bad Education are even shown online first before being aired on TV. Lord Hall said: ‘I don’t know how long it will be before channels as a way of organising our viewing... are overtaken by us saying, “It’s all on demand.” 'We’ve got to prepare for an age where it’s all on the go, it’s on demand.’ The peer made his comments at an event to celebrate the 60th anniversary of BBC News last week. 'He said the Corporation was doing all it could to keep pace with technological change and that in his ‘gut’ he thought viewers would watch traditional TV for ‘a long way ahead into the future’. But when asked to clarify what he meant, he said: ‘No, because I know what’ll happen. Someone will say, “You said 15 years, 20 years, and it turned out to be ten.” Or, “You said five years, and it turned out to be 20.” All I know is, my iPad was not invented five years ago.’ Looking to the future: The peer, speaking at an event to mark the 60th anniversary of BBC News, said they needed to prepare for an age when all television was watched on the go, requiring it to be 'on demand'","Lord Hall said they could be replaced by internet catch-up services .

So at first glance, the caption ‘Proud to be the queens’ grocer’ in its latest advert would appear to be proud a reference to its Royal Warrant with Buckingham Palace.

Note the apostrophe and that hot bit of crumpet!’ Another fan wrote: ‘Kudos to Fortnum & Mason’, and another added: ‘Brilliant Gay Pride ad from Fortnum & Mason.’ The iconic store, in London’s Piccadilly, has impeccable Royal credentials, having been founded by William Fortnum, a former footman in the Court of Queen Anne, and his landlord Hugh Mason. The store, which opened for business in 1707, received its first Royal warrant in 1863 and has warrants with the current Queen and the Prince  of Wales dating back to 1955 and 1996 respectively. Last night, a spokesman for Fortnum & Mason said: ‘We are proud to support Pride.’ A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.","Fortnum & Mason has enjoyed Royal patronage for more than 150 years .

"By . Chris Hastings . Sir Simon Rattle said the Barbican cannot compare to international venues . Britain’s most celebrated conductor, Sir Simon Rattle, has attacked the lack of world-class music venues in London. Sir Simon said the acoustics at the capital’s Barbican – home to the London Symphony Orchestra – could not compare with the other international or even regional venues. He said: ‘The Barbican is a good concert hall but it’s not a great concert hall. London deserves a great concert hall. ‘It would be wonderful if  there was a hall as good as in Birmingham or Manchester, or even the Snape Maltings in Suffolk. Great orchestras deserve a great instrument to play in.’ Rattle is tipped to take over at the LSO when he leaves the Berlin Philharmonic in 2018. Some sources say he will only accept if the orchestra leaves the Barbican, but he said speculation about his future  was a ‘pain in the rear’. Sir Simon, 56, worked with the LSO at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games – along with Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean. The conductor said: ‘The memory is being in the stadium with 80,000 and hearing them announce that Simon Rattle and the LSO will play Chariots Of Fire and hear 80,000 go,  “Oh!” And then, ten seconds in, to see Mr Bean and 80,000 people laughing. It is one of the most extraordinary sounds I have ever heard.’ Sir Simon – whose third wife, Magdalena Kozena, is expecting his fifth child – added it was important to protect the arts in a recession. He said: ‘It is always a mistake when arts are the first thing to be cut.’","Sir Simon Rattle said capital's venues can't compare to those around world .

"By . Chris Hastings . Sir Cliff Richard has addressed long-running rumours about his sexuality, asking a television interviewer: ‘If I was gay would it make any difference?’ The veteran singer, who has never married, said speculation about his possible homosexuality was painful when he was younger but that it had ceased to concern him. The 73-year-old, best known for hits such as Bachelor Boy and Summer Holiday, tackled rumours about his private life in a candid interview for the Australian television programme A Current Affair, which was broadcast on Friday night. Scroll down for video . Sir Cliff Richard told an Australian television presenter 'If I was gay would it make any difference?' Asked if the gossip about his sexual orientation hurt him, he replied: ‘No. It did when I was young. It hurt my family a lot, of course. But who cares? ‘It doesn’t really matter to me any more. I have got gay friends. Most people have gay friends. If I was  gay would it make any difference? Would you not come to my concerts because I was gay? I hope not.’ Rumours about Sir Cliff’s private life have dogged him for decades.  A relationship he has with John  McElynn, a former Catholic priest who looks after his homes in Britain, Barbados and Portugal, has only served to fuel the speculation. Sir Cliff was photographed with many glamorous women during his career such as Vivienne Ventura on the set of film 'Finders Keepers' Sir Cliff, who first hit the charts in 1958 with the song Move It and who has now sold more than 250 million records around the world, said he  had never wanted the responsibility of having a wife and family. He said: ‘I just didn’t get married. I never felt that it was the right  time. I can do the things I want to  do. I can go and meet my fans all over the world. ‘I don’t have a responsibility because I always felt that marriage would  be the major responsibility of your life, and if a child came along, a multi-major responsibility. No getting out  of that one.’ Sir Cliff said he never 'trashed a hotel room' and admitted he has tried botox . Asked whether his friendship with Olivia Newton-John, the Australian singer and star of the film Grease, could ever have led to marriage, Sir Cliff replied: ‘Let’s face it, we all loved Olivia. She had that effect. ‘When she came on to do my TV show, we invited her [to appear] for one week, but she was there for  about eight.’ Sir Cliff, whose continued youthful looks have earned him the title the Peter Pan of pop, insists he has never undergone plastic surgery but would not rule it out. He said: ‘Plastic? Well, I think it’s due. When people say to me, have  you had anything done, I say yes, I had these lines put in because I wanted  to look older. ‘I did try Botox but that didn’t really work for me. I’ve seen people with Botox – they look fantastic. ‘If it works for you, I don’t see what’s wrong with doing it. Why not? Women wear make-up.’ Sir Cliff says his continued youthful appearance may be down to ‘extreme good luck’ and the fact that his mother remained young-looking. He also says he is proud that he never adopted the hedonistic lifestyle of a typical rock ’n’ roll star. The star said: ‘I’ve never wanted  to trash a hotel room. My band always used to say, Cliff never trashes a  hotel room. ‘When he goes in, he usually cleans up, hoovers, checks the curtains are straight. I can’t imagine anything more childish than trashing things, which is what a lot of rockers did.’","Sir Cliff admits that he has used Botox 'but it didn't really work' for him .

"By . Chris Hastings . Spirit of adventure: Bear Grylls, who is Britain's Chief Scout, dredged up old documents on his grandfather's exploits and decided to fictionalise them . TV adventurer Bear Grylls has signed a £1million book deal for a series of novels inspired by the secret wartime exploits of his grandfather. The explorer hopes the trilogy of stories about a fictional former Special Forces soldier called Dan Ranger will resonate with fans of classic spy thrillers. Grylls, 39, who is Britain’s Chief Scout, said: ‘I think adventure literature is ripe for a makeover! ‘It is all about taking the reader on an incredible adventure and always surprising them just when they think they know where the plot is leading them.’ The father-of-three, whose TV credits include the hit series Born Survivor, was inspired to put pen to paper when he began studying forgotten family files which detailed the work of his late grandfather, Brigadier Ted Grylls. Brig Grylls was part of a crack unit tasked with capturing Nazi scientists and their secrets before they fell into the hands of Stalin’s Red Army at the end of the Second World War. Even at the 11th hour, Hitler hoped his scientists could secure victory with a new range of intercontinental ballistic missiles able to deliver nerve gas to American cities. Government files declassified in 2006 revealed that such special units helped to ensure more than 1,500 German scientists were transported to Britain and America after 1945. Bear said: ‘The role and memory of my grandfather will echo through the first three books. He led a group tasked to recover and secure Nazi technology for the Allies. ‘This was a race between the British and the Americans versus the Russians as the Cold War began to take hold, a race we mostly won.’ Grylls, an honorary Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Naval Reserve, said he was largely ignorant of his grandfather’s role until he made an extraordinary discovery. He said: ‘I had found these old military boxes in the attic at home when we sold my grandfather’s house after he passed away. Wartime exploits: Brigadier Ted Grylls was part of a crack unit charged with capturing Nazi scientists in the dying days of the Second World War . ‘What we found was amazing – bundles of old documents tied up with seals and the words Top Secret stamped across them. Old silk escape maps and orders and code booklets. But literally masses of all this stuff, meticulously put together and untouched since the war.’ Grylls, who is working on the novels with former war reporter Damien Lewis, said as they read through the material they quickly realised that it lent itself to a work of fiction. He said: ‘I sat with Damien and we thrashed through loads of ideas based on these documents and some of the very credible conspiracy theories around the mass exodus of Nazi technology and personnel in the last months of the war. ‘Then we asked family and friends their opinions and each time it kept coming back to the same premise – truth is stranger than fiction.’ A central theme of all three novels is the idea that there is a modern-day conspiracy to raise Hitler’s Third Reich from the ashes. Grylls said his own list of adventure heroes might be considered a little obvious. He added: ‘The literary characters who have inspired me include Hornblower, Robin Hood, Phileas Fogg, Bourne, Flashman, Bond and Indiana Jones. I know that sounds a bit cliched, but if people are honest, I reckon I am not alone.’ Orion books, which will publish  all three novels, will confirm details of what it called the ‘seven-figure book deal’ today. The first book in the series, Ghost Flight, will be published in May next year.","Grylls, 39, signed deal for adventure books starring special forces soldier .

"By . Chris Hastings . Big Break: Hugh Grant with Andie MacDowell in the heart-warming 1994 movie . Hugh Grant became an overnight star when he was cast as the hapless Charles in the smash-hit movie Four Weddings And A Funeral. But the actor almost lost out on the role of a lifetime because the producers of the film, which celebrates its 20th anniversary next month, thought he was too good-looking – and he wanted an extra £5,000 for the part. In an interview on today’s Reunion programme on BBC Radio 4, Richard Curtis – who wrote the screenplay – reveals that he tried to block the casting of Grant because he didn’t think anyone would believe he could be unlucky in love. He said: ‘I was worried about it. When Hugh did first come in, I did think he was too handsome. I thought people would not believe the fact he was in trouble with girls because he so clearly wouldn’t be. So that’s why he pushed the sort of doubtfulness and lack of confidence. ‘He was by far the best person who auditioned but I still voted against him when it came down to the vote between two people.’ Grant, who had previously starred in the Merchant Ivory film Maurice, was a relatively unknown 33-year-old when Curtis was over-ruled and he was cast for a fee of £35,000. But the film’s producer Duncan Kenworthy recalls how Grant, who appeared opposite US actress Andie MacDowell, almost lost the role when his agent asked for an additional £5,000. He said: ‘We couldn’t afford much at all. So the “friends” got £17,500 each and Hugh got £35,000. I  remember Michael Foster, Hugh’s agent, saying, “OK, we understand. £40,000 and he is yours.” I said, “Sorry, you just don’t understand. It’s £35,000 and if you don’t accept that then obviously we lose him.” ’ Curtis, Kenworthy and the film’s director Mike Newell also recall how they had to come up with ingenious cost-cutting measures so that they could produce Four Weddings on a budget of £3million. Film: Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell laugh as they film a scene in Four Weddings And A Funeral . DVD: The film Four Weddings & A Funeral became a smash hit but it's leading man nearly missed out . Block: Richard Curtis, who wrote the screenplay, reveals that he tried to block the casting of Grant . Kenworthy said: ‘For the second wedding we had what I called an aristocracy co-ordinator. Amber Rudd, now an MP, knew a lot of dukes and earls who would appear for nothing, or for an extra’s pay. ‘I swear that you can look across the room and pick out the real aristocrats. So they gave us the authenticity. They all owned their own morning suits, so we saved on the Moss Bros aspect of the budget.’ Writer and director Curtis, 57  – who went on to make the films Notting Hill and Love Actually, also starring Grant – says he wrote the film partly to explain to his own mother why he had never married but hints that he might be about to propose to his real long-term partner, Emma Freud. ‘Thinking about it, I might pop the question soon,’ he says. After finishing the romantic comedy, Kenworthy says that the film’s US distributors insisted the opening scene, where Grant’s character repeatedly says the F-word, was reshot. In the American version Charles says the word ‘bugger’ over and over again. He also recalls how Hollywood bosses feared they would not be able to market the movie as  a romantic comedy. But the movie defied all expectations and went on to make £146million at the box office – with Grant becoming one of the world’s most bankable stars.","Hollywood star Hugh Grant nearly missed out on being cast in Four Weddings And A Funeral due to his good looks .

"By . Chris Hastings . Icon: Jedi Master Yoda's creator George Lucas was worried the Star Wars film could be a flop . Star Wars mastermind George Lucas had doubts about the original 1977 film and feared it might flop. Lucas, now 70, worried the sci-fi blockbuster hadn’t lived up to his own high expectations and was little more than a mainstream children’s film. The actor Richard Dreyfuss reveals Lucas’s fears in a four-part BBC 2 series that charts the history of science fiction in popular culture. Dreyfuss, who was filming Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters Of The Third Kind at the same time, said: ‘George was seeing the film we were shooting, and in many ways he had wanted that to be Star Wars.’ Dreyfuss also recalls a meeting with a ‘very glum’ Lucas in a restaurant just as work on Star Wars was winding down. ‘George said, “I made a kids’ film,” and he had wanted to make an adult film. And we all commiserated with the billionaire-to-be.’ Several cast members, including Anthony Daniels, who played robot C-3PO, and Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker, also had concerns, particularly about their dialogue. Daniels tells the documentary: ‘I remember driving across the desert one morning with Mark Hamill. We, out of courtesy, were going through each other’s lines and I said to him, “How can you say rubbish like that with a straight face”. He said, “Well you have to say it as well!” ‘And I said, “Yes, but I am behind a mask. None of my friends know I am in this movie so it’s fine.”’Daniels added: ‘Probably we all thought, “This is not a good film. It’s not a film anyone’s going to see.”’ Alan Ladd Jnr, former president of 20th Century Fox, tells the programme he was the only one in the studio who had any faith in the film. He said the studio’s board opposed it and continued to ‘hate’ it after the first private screening. But such concerns were quickly forgotten when the film, which co-starred Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Sir Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, was released. It quickly became the highest grossing movie of all time until it was overtaken by Spielberg’s ET six years later. Lucas went on to direct another five Star Wars movies, introducing iconic characters such as Yoda, the Jedi Master who spoke sentences backwards. The series has taken more than $4 billion at the box office and is the fifth most successful franchise in movie history. Blockbuster: Actors in the first Star Wars movie also had concerns about the film, particularly their dialogue . Walt Disney, which bought Lucas’s film company in 2012, has announced a further trilogy of films which will reunite the original cast, including Ford, Hamill, Daniels, and Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia. The new film, which has the working title of Star Wars VII, began shooting in Britain last week and will be released in December 2015. The BBC 2 series, The History Of Science Fiction, will be screened later this year. It also looks at the appeal of the Star Trek franchise and argues that although the programme flaunted its multicultural cast it was a propaganda vehicle for imperialism.","Director George Lucas worried blockbuster hadn't lived up to expectations .

"By . Chris Hastings . It's a new series that follows the fortunes of a group of senior executives as the BBC lurches from one crisis to another. But this is no fly-on-the-wall documentary showing how the Corporation is trying to tackle its problems: this is a comedy that makes light of a series of scandals that have cost licence fee payers millions of pounds. In one episode, real BBC executive Alan Yentob makes a cameo appearance, where he is seen arm-wrestling with novelist Salman Rushdie. Executive decision: Hugh Bonneville, centre, a BBC official Ian Fletcher in the forthcoming comedy W1A . W1A, which will be broadcast later this month, stars Downton Abbey’s Hugh Bonneville, and several of the characters and storylines bear a striking similarity to real people and events. Bonneville plays Ian Fletcher, who has been hired to chart a new course for the BBC in light of what are described as ‘recent learning opportunities’. These ‘opportunities’ seem to be an obvious reference to the crises which continue to engulf the publicly funded broadcaster .  .  . THE COMEDY: Staff are forced  to rely on a new IT system called Syncopatico. It is meant to revolutionise life,  – but actually  it doesn’t work. THE REALITY: In April 2013 the BBC scrapped its state-of-the-art ‘Digital Media Initiative’ at a  cost to licence fee payers of  £100 million. Spending watchdog the National Audit Office subsequently accused the Corporation’s senior executives of losing ‘their grip’ on the system. THE COMEDY: The Corporation is thrown into crisis when  Sally Wingate, a veteran presenter on the regional programme Spotlight South West, claims her career has  been held back because of the broadcaster’s institutional  anti-West Country bias. THE REALITY: In 2011 Miriam O’Reilly, 53, took the BBC to an employment tribunal claiming she had been dropped as a presenter of Countryfile because of her age. The presenter won her case and returned to work at the BBC. Taking the strain: Salman Rushdie, left, and the BBC's Alan Yentob in the comedy series . THE COMEDY: Bonneville’s character Ian Fletcher, newly appointed as Head of Values, has been brought in to turn around the beleaguered Corporation in the light of a  wave of scandals or ‘specific learning opportunities’. During a meeting of the BBC’s ‘Way Ahead taskforce’, he describes the broadcaster as ‘one of the greatest ideas in the world’  and insists that it must face the challenges of the future  with ‘confidence’. THE REALITY: Tony Hall, who  took up his post as Director General in April 2013, has said the Corporation most become more ‘aggressive’ and ‘less British’ when it comes to defending its corner. THE COMEDY:  Employees at the BBC’s high-tech New Broadcasting House HQ complain about their open-plan office, which contains ‘interactive spaces’ rather than actual offices. THE REALITY: Last year the BBC spent £500,000 on a revamp of its brand new £1 billion New Broadcasting House because staff there claimed it was not vibrant or creative enough. The improvements included the installation of ‘a new collaboration project zone.’ THE COMEDY: The BBC’s next big must-see production is Britain’s Tastiest Village,  which is billed as ‘Countryfile meets the Bake Off with a bit of  the One Show thrown in just  in case’. THE REALITY: Critics say  that the Corporation’s schedules are dominated  by consumer and lifestyle programmes. This is despite the fact that the BBC  Trust has called for more original and distinctive  TV shows.","W1A makes light of scandals that have cost licence fee payers millions .

"By . Chris Hastings . They are two of Britain’s most acclaimed comedy writers, between them responsible for  The Young Ones, Blackadder and Four Weddings And A Funeral. But there is one BBC sitcom so bizarre, and deemed such a dud, that it has been airbrushed from the CVs of Ben Elton and Richard Curtis – and never screened in the 30 years since it was made. The pair wrote a show in  which Margaret Thatcher was a space alien who had been recalled to Mars – then replaced as  Prime Minister by Suggs from  the pop group Madness, with his bandmates as the Cabinet. The show called 'Madness' featuring the band was never commissioned by BBC 2 and the pilot show was never broadcast . A clip from the show, called simply Madness, will be seen for the first time tonight as part of BBC2’s 50th birthday celebrations. Described as a ‘dummy run which didn’t make it out of the starting blocks’, the show was never commissioned as a series. Jokes in the 1984 episode – in which the seat of power has been transplanted to a room above a cafe – include one musician telling Suggs: ‘Prime Minister, I don’t want to scare you – but boo!’ In another scene Suggs discovers that he has carried saxophonist Lee Thompson all the way from Kentish Town in North London to Downing Street in his saxophone case. An unrepentant Thompson tells Suggs, ‘You ought to be glad I don’t play the piano’, and Suggs turns directly to the camera and says: ‘Good point!’ The clips are included in a documentary called The Comedy Vaults: BBC2’s Hidden Treasure, which celebrates trial shows ‘made for little money and usually not for public consumption’. Other clips include scenes from Miranda Hart’s Joke Shop from 2008, which became the hugely successful Miranda, and the now forgotten Guess Who’s Coming  To Dinner, in which Anne Robinson asked celebrities for their ideal dinner party guests. In the pilot, Ricky Gervais tells the Weakest Link host ‘not to try any of your fascist prostitute stuff’. Another of the shows which had never been broadcast featured Alan Bennett . The documentary also includes a recently discovered performance from Alan Bennett in his 1966 series On The Margin. The playwright, who turned 80 on Friday, plays a businessman who signs off a telegram to his wife with ‘Norwich’, which he explains is code for ‘Nickers off, ready when I come home’. Until the clip was found, it had been assumed the entire series of On The Margin had been wiped by the BBC. Tonight’s documentary, which airs at 9pm, also includes footage of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in their stage show Behind The Fridge, which has not been shown on British TV for 45 years, and the pilot episode of QI from 2002. Elton and Curtis were unavailable to comment on Madness last night.","Comedy legends failed to get a daring TV show aired in the 1980s .

"By . Chris Hastings . Lord Lloyd-Webber’s musical about Stephen Ward, the fixer at the centre of the Profumo affair, is ‘on a knife edge’ and expected to close after a run of just six months in London’s West End. The Oscar-winning composer of Evita and Cats has told friends that the future of the production, which revisits Britain’s most infamous sex scandal, is ‘touch and go’. Stephen Ward The Musical opened at the Aldwych Theatre in December, receiving generally good reviews. The show opened at the historic Aldwych theatre in London, but is unlikely to see through its initial 6-month run due to dismal ticket sales . The combination of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s name and the public’s continuing interest in the 1963 affair – which led to the downfall of John Profumo, the Conservative Secretary of State  for War – seemed certain to produce another box-office hit. But sources close to the production, which has a book and lyrics by Oscar winners Don Black and Christopher Hampton, confirm that ticket sales have been sluggish and that the show is unlikely to survive its initial booking period, which runs out at the end of May. Audiences have been surprised by big discounts on tickets and how many have been available. Last month, seats normally selling for £67.50 were cut to £39.50. If the show closes in May, this will be the shortest-lived of Lloyd Webber’s career. In comparison, The Phantom Of The Opera opened in 1986 and is still running. One insider said: ‘Andrew has told friends that the show is touch and go at the moment. Things are on a knife edge and sales have not lived up to expectations. ‘It’s a shame if it doesn’t find an audience because the fact is all the three writers are very proud of it.’ The show opened at the historic Aldwych theatre in London, but is unlikely to see through its initial 6-month run due to dismal ticket sales . The show focuses on the trial of Ward, an osteopath, who was accused of living off immoral earnings. Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies were to be the main witnesses. The writers are convinced Ward was a scapegoat and innocent of the charges. He killed himself before the verdict. Lloyd Webber is supporting an attempt by Geoffrey Robertson QC to have Ward’s conviction quashed. Last night a spokesman for the Criminal Cases Review Commission said it had studied Robertson’s arguments and decided they were worthy of further investigation.","Lloyd-Webber's musical follows the downfall of politician John Profumo .

"By . Chris Hastings . Sir David Frost was a household name on both sides  of the Atlantic, interviewing almost as many US presidents as British prime ministers. But his early attempts to make it in America so infuriated his BBC bosses they considered dropping him altogether. Letters published for the first time today show Corporation chiefs who signed up the 25-year-old as the £600-a-week host of Not So Much A Programme More A Way Of Life were horrified to discover he was committed to presenting a show from New York at the same time. Back in the days: Sir David Frost's early attempts to make it in America in the 1960s infuriated his BBC bosses . In a letter dated November 20, 1964, Donald Baverstock, controller of BBC 1, wrote to a colleague: ‘I was surprised and a little alarmed to find that Frost was leaving every Monday for New York and returning on Thursday of each week. ‘As I recollect, one of the reasons why we had to go as high as we did was his agent’s reminder of the money in America he was turning down  to do this programme.’ Frost, star of That Was The Week That Was, had originally demanded £1,000 a week to reflect ‘his standing and success in this country and in America’. Letters reveal senior BBC staff considered dropping Sir David altogether after finding out about his U.S. work . Baverstock added in his letter: ‘We must watch the situation very carefully. His option to continue beyond the initial six weeks should not be taken up without further discussion between you and I.’ The BBC 1 head quit soon afterwards to join Yorkshire TV.

"By . Chris Hastings . Sir Alec Guinness wrote to his wife Merula, telling her he saw a ghost while filming in India . Sir Alec Guinness played Marley’s ghost on the big screen and was resurrected as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films. But the Oscar-winner also had a real-life otherworldly encounter, according to letters published for the first time today. Then 69 and a devout Catholic, Sir Alec said he saw a ghost while in Bangalore filming David Lean’s A Passage To India. In a letter to his wife Merula dated March 23, 1984 he wrote: ‘Last night I heard my bathroom door click open. I was immediately awake and called, “What’s that?” ‘A very conventional white ghost appeared, an elderly... woman in grey white and heavily veiled. ‘I couldn’t make out her face. She moved... with dignity down the side of my bed and as I clicked on the light she disappeared.’ Guinness, whose credits include The Bridge On The River Kwai and The Ladykillers as well as Marley’s ghost in the 1970 film Scrooge, told his wife if he hadn’t seen a spirit then he must have been dreaming ‘while sitting up and awake’. Although deeply religious, Sir Alec was interested in the psychic world and reportedly told James Dean not to drive on the day the star died in a crash in 1955. Piers Paul Read, Guinness’s official biographer, last night said he was not aware of the letter. He said: ‘Alec was quite superstitious... In the Navy he also had a premonition about being drowned in an oncoming storm. I don’t think he claimed to be psychic but he was open to the idea.’ In other letters acquired by the British Library, Guinness reveals he and director David Lean, who had worked together five times previously, were barely speaking during the filming of A Passage To India. Their rows lead Sir Alec to write: ‘I don’t think I will ever bother to do a film again.’ In another letter he delights in having been to Mass as he feels it allows him to keep on hating Lean. The actor, who played Ben Kenobi in Star Wars, wrote: 'A very conventional white ghost appeared, an elderly... woman in grey white and heavily veiled'","Letters published for the first time today reveal Oscar-winner had a real-life otherworldy encounter .

"By . Chris Hastings . Lord Archer is suing one of Britain’s top theatre producers after losing his £625,000 investment in a musical about The Beatles. The peer, former deputy chairman of the Tory Party, has accused Karl Sydow of reneging on a deal to repay his investment in Backbeat, a musical that tells the story of the so-called fifth Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe. Novelist Lord Archer, who has a personal fortune of about £135 million, agreed to invest in the West End production on the understanding that if the show failed to recoup its investment, Sydow and his company Dance With Mr D would pay him back using profits from a touring production of Dirty Dancing. Waxing lyrical: Andrew Knott and Daniel Healy in Backbeat which was met with mixed reviews . But the two sides are now locked  in a High Court dispute about exactly when and how the money should  be reimbursed. Backbeat, which opened at the  Duke of York’s Theatre in London in September 2011, was based on the 1994 film of the same name and told the story of The Beatles’ early days as they travelled from their native Liverpool to Hamburg. Observers thought the inclusion of the group’s early hits such as Twist And Shout would make the show a surefire moneyspinner. I want my money backbeat: Lord Archer is taking High Court action . Stars including David Tennant, Dominic Cooper, Gary Lineker and Harry Enfield all attended its first night, and Stephen Fry subsequently tweeted: ‘I am in pieces. Backbeat at the Duke of York’s. So much more than a jukebox. Heart-rending. exultant fabulous.’ But reviews of the show were mixed, with one critic saying it had left  him feeling ‘bored and depressed’ and that the lead performers were less convincing than waxworks of the younger Beatles at Madame Tussauds – ‘notorious’ for being unrecognisable as the Fab Four. The show, which starred Andrew Knott and Daniel Healy as John Lennon and Paul McCartney, closed in February 2012. By contrast Dirty Dancing, which is also produced by Sydow and based on the 1987 film of the same name, has played to packed houses across Britain. The show’s first UK tour is reputed to have taken £42 million and a second tour is about to begin in March. Backbeat was not Lord Archer’s first encounter with Beatlemania. In 1963, when the former Tory Pary chairman was studying for an education diploma in Oxford, he persuaded the band to perform at a fundraiser for Oxfam. The critic Sheridan Morley recalled a conversation he had with Ringo Starr in the toilets at the time. The Beatle told Morley that Archer struck him as ‘a nice enough fella,’ before adding that ‘he was the kind  of bloke who would bottle your p*** and sell it’.

"By . Chris Hastings . Miley Cyrus also took flak from angry parents for appearing to wear a costume emblazoned with a cannabis design . Miley Cyrus’s critics may have dismissed her outrageous stage antics as soft porn – but the defiant star insists she is an artist trying to educate children. The American singer’s Bangerz tour, which kicked off in Canada on Valentine’s Day, has drawn complaints from parents who have taken offence at Cyrus miming a sex act with a man wearing a Bill Clinton mask and dancing in a glittering leotard decorated with cannabis leaves. But the 21-year-old, who caused a sensation when she ‘twerked’ on stage with Robin Thicke at last year’s MTV awards said she was working her ‘ass off’ to be ‘a better person’. She said:  ‘I want this to be a pretty high-end tour. I want it to be like good art. 'And I am excited to go to places where people are usually not exposed to too much good art. It can be a good education for the kids who come to my concert.’ She added: ‘I want to show people that music can not only be entertaining but educational as well. ‘Maybe people don’t think of me first when it comes to education, but I might surprise a couple of people.’ Scroll down for video .

Cyrus has said she is a hard worker, but that she does not have many friends . She said: ‘Look, I am not the little girl any more. I think everybody knows that by now. I want to be my own person, I want to change all the time to become a better artist, a better person. I work my ass off, and I like who I am.’ Cyrus claims that she finds what young girls are wearing today 'boring' and that they should try to be more experimental . The star said it was time that young girls, including her own fans, became more adventurous. She said: ‘I like to experiment. I like to try new things. I don’t understand what most girls are wearing today. 'I find it boring. Why don’t younger children try to be more risque. I like  it when you find a style that can be your own personal style.’ The singer also revealed that she didn’t have that many friends. ‘I am a pretty honest person. I like people who don’t lie to me. 'And I want to laugh. So, if you are funny, and you can make me laugh, you are good in my book. I don’t have that many friends.’ Cyrus, who is due to bring her tour to . Britain in May, said her critics had to appreciate she was no longer . the child star she used to be.

But the Hollywood star knows exactly what her real-life husband is up to because they share the same email address and she even reads his messages.

"By . Chris Hastings . Inspiration: Lady Carnarvon in her nurse's uniform at her own makeshift hospital during the Great War . The socialite who was the inspiration for Downton Abbey’s Lady Cora refused an honour recognising her work caring for the wounded during the First World War. Almina, the 5th Countess of Carnarvon, who trained as a nurse and turned Highclere Castle into a military hospital, apparently did not think she merited the CBE offered in the 1920 Honours List. Her decision is recorded in Cabinet Office papers obtained by The Mail on Sunday. They reveal she was one of several female aristocrats who declined to be honoured. Almina, who was known as the ‘pocket-sized Venus’, transformed herself from a flamboyant socialite into a tireless campaigner after the outbreak of war in 1914. She dug deep into her own fortune and equipped Highclere – where Downton is filmed – with an operating theatre in one of the bedrooms and a recovery room next door. Officers who were treated there recalled being served beer by footmen and described it as ‘paradise’. On one occasion the Countess, who tended the men personally, had to fire ‘a pretty auburn-haired nurse’ after discovering her ‘in flagrante delicto’ with a patient – future Brigadier-General Sir George Paynter. These experiences – including the sex scandal – shaped the second series of Downton, which was screened in 2011. It showed the Crawley family transforming their house into a rest home for injured officers. The current Lady Carnarvon, who is . Almina’s biographer, said last night she was unaware of the . recommendation but was not surprised it had been declined. Legacy: The loving and generous Lady Cora (centre) in ITV's Downton Abbey was based on Lady Almina . She said: ‘Almina was not the sort of person who would have wanted a fuss. She was one of a generation of women who just got on with it.’ The Cabinet Office papers show that the women were among about 760 people who turned down honours between 1918 and 1920. The files do not explain their reluctance but it is possible they considered such awards unpalatable after seeing the horrors of the Great War. Millicent, Duchess of Sutherland, was a celebrated beauty who ran an ambulance unit and several field hospitals close to the front line. She turned down a CBE in 1919. Transformation: Highclere Castle, where Lady Almina lived and where Downton Abbey is filmed, became a military hospital during the First World War, which Lady Almina funded with her own money and worked at as a nurse . Lady Stirling Maxwell, who turned her Scottish home, Pollok House, into a hospital, and one of her  London residences into a home for blinded soldiers, rejected an unspecified honour in 1920. Her grandson, Sir John Maxwell Macdonald, last night recalled  family talk of her declining an OBE. He said: ‘She already had a title and didn’t want any more. The Maxwell family tended to be against decorations as a whole. ‘My grandmother was keen to play her part and she wouldn’t have given any thought to honours. That would have been out of the question. She wasn’t that sort of person.’ Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey, said: ‘I am certain many of these women were genuinely modest about their achievements and did not desire to be what we would call celebrities. ‘It was enough for them to know that their work had been valued by the officers and men.’ He added: ‘For us as a generation, unfaked modesty and finding satisfaction in the work itself – rather than in public adulation – are very difficult to believe in. But for these women, to be recognised in the street would have been torture.’","Lady Almina Carnarvon turned Highclere into hospital and worked as nurse .

"By . Chris Hastings . She is the wife of a former Archbishop and a noted theologian who has written about the role of women in the male-dominated Church. Yet when asked to name her favourite female biblical character, Jane Williams drew a blank – and plumped for St Paul instead. Her decision to overlook all of the 188 women named in the scriptures is especially ironic given that she was asked the question for a new book about prejudice in the Christian establishment. ‘I am afraid I have to say my favourite biblical figure is a man and I don’t have a favourite woman,’ said the lecturer, who is married to former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Woman of god: Dr Jane Williams and her husband, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who couldn't name an important woman in the Bible . Instead she chose St Paul, saying: ‘I just think Paul is one of the great maligned and misunderstood figures in the Bible. ‘But I think that he’s such a complex and interesting person and responsible for so much of how we see theology.’ Dr Williams is one of 12 prominent female Christians who were interviewed for Women In Waiting, a new book by Julia Ogilvy, subtitled Prejudice At The Heart Of The Church. Mrs Ogilvy – daughter-in-law of the Queen’s cousin Princess Alexandra – even cites the patriarchal writings of St Paul as one reason why women’s progress has been hampered. Nonetheless, 57-year-old Dr Williams – who wrote her own book, Bread, Wine And Women, about female ordination – praised her hero’s ‘complete passion’ and the fact he ‘changed his life’ after his conversion when he had a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus. The mother of two, a lecturer at  St Paul’s Theological Centre in London, added: ‘He is an intellectual person who’s going to do such rigorous theology but it was the encounter with Jesus that took him there.’ None of Dr Williams’s fellow contributors have had any difficulty naming their heroines, with one even opting for the bleeding woman who touches Jesus in Luke 8, 40-48. Madonna of the Pinks, (Madonna dei Garofani), by Raphael dated 1507-8. The role of women in Christian iconography is very well documented by artwork, studies and literature . Baroness Helena Kennedy, the Catholic QC, is one of two contributors to pick Mary Magdalene, the second most important woman in  the New Testament after The Virgin Mary. Although traditionally portrayed as a fallen woman saved from a life of sin by Christ, she is now believed to have been a teacher and a leader in her own right. Rev Tamsin Merchant, a vicar in North London, chooses Deborah, the Old Testament prophet and warrior who inspired troops into battle. In her contribution, Dr Williams is careful not to rock the boat on the role of women in the Church. She wrote: ‘I partly agree with  the problem of the Church’s patriarchal image but the other side is  that there are quite a lot of women in fairly senior positions in the Church of England.’","Wife of Rowan Williams couldn't think of a woman that she liked from the bible .

"By . Chris Hastings . Shot to fame: Violinist Nicola Benedetti . The violinist who became an overnight sensation when named BBC Young Musician of the Year today reveals how she struggled when plunged into an 'extremely cut-throat' world, writes Chris Hastings. Speaking on today's Desert Island Discs, Nicola Benedetti tells of the relentless demands placed on her at 16 – including 110 concerts in a year. She adds: 'By the age of 17 or 18 I was going through a very tough time.' Nicola, now 26, won the contest in 2004 and tells interviewer Kirsty Young that senior figures in the industry failed to help her even as it was clear she was riddled with anxiety and self-doubt. She says: 'I look back on it and I am slightly disappointed with a couple of experiences where  I felt someone could have been more advisory. 'I think I did feel that some of that support wasn't necessarily there within the profession. It is extremely cut-throat.' Nicola signed a £1 million deal after winning the BBC prize and immediately embarked on a punishing performance schedule. She says: 'The Young Musician of the Year final happened and I think the next day my photo was on the front page of The Times and a practically full concert diary materialised within a very very short space of time.' She was made an MBE in 2013, but says the workload hampered her progress as a musician.'It was actually far too much for that age and for the stage that I was at in my violinistic development... I actually wasn't ready for that. 'I knew I wasn't fulfilling my potential at all. I knew I was going on stage underprepared, extremely nervous. I was trying to make sense of, “Why I am here? Why do I have all this opportunity? Do I deserve it?”.' Despite her glamorous image, she says she and her boyfriend, German cellist Leonard Elschenbroich, have no interest in being the Brad and Angelina of the classical music world. She says: 'Glamorous is definitely not a word that I would associate with my life.'

"By . Chris Hastings . Charged: Samora 'Black Dee' Roberts has been charged with drug offences and a firearm offence, police said today . One of the claimants featured on Channel 4’s controversial  Benefits Street has been charged with drug and firearms offences. Samora Roberts, 32, who is better know to viewers of the hit reality TV series as ‘Black Dee’ has been charged with conspiracy to supply a class B drug, conspiracy to supply a class A drug (crack cocaine), possession of a Class A drug (diamorphine) and possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate. Roberts and five of her neighbours were charged following a series of drug raids on properties in the now infamous James Turner Street in Birmingham . One other young man who lives in the Handsworth area of the city has been charged as a result of the same raids. All those charged have been bailed to appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on  February 6. Roberts is one of the most high-profile subjects of the series, and details of the charges against her were made public yesterday afternoon, just hours after other reports alleged that she had recently been arrested for stealing a packet of condoms from a branch of Boots. In a statement, West Midlands Police said the raids, which  took place last June, were a response to concerns raised by the local community. The others who were charged include Charlene Wilson, 29, who has also appeared in the show and has been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine and cannabis (a class  B drug) and possession of diamorphine. Four other residents on the street have also been charged. Tina Thomas, 46, has been charged with conspiracy to  supply cannabis and possession of ammunition without a certificate. Ian Wright, 38, has been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine and cannabis. And Monique Walker, 28, and Marvin Scott, 37, who have both been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine. Omari George, 20, from another road in Handsworth, has been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine  and cannabis. Scroll down for video . In total, seven people were charged with a number of offences. Six live in the street, the subject of the Channel 4 documentary . A spokesman for Channel 4 last night . said it had no plans to make any changes to the show in light of the . charges, despite the potential risk of prejudicing any future court . cases. Benefits Street is the broadcaster’s biggest ratings hit since . its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012. Critics . of the five-part series, which continues tomorrow night, have accused . it of  glamorising crime, promoting drug use and celebrating welfare . dependency. The first . episode featured a visit to a cannabis farm in  one of the street’s 137 . houses and an interview with a serial shoplifter who explained in detail . how to dodge CCTV  cameras and remove security tags. Hundreds of . viewers  complained about Channel 4 sharing apparent tips for would-be . criminals. Shoplifter . ‘Danny’ was shown returning from a shopping centre from which he had . apparently stolen five jackets which he claims he can sell for £250. The programme has courted controversy from the start, with the inhabitants of the street saying that the producers 'did anything they could' to get the most shocking footage . Another . resident, called ‘Fungi’, was shown taking four magazines from a . Premier Inn hotel. He referred to the magazines as his own ‘Big Issue’ and persuaded a woman in a sports car to buy one for £3. The . next two episodes, which  looked at the issues of immigration and drug . use, have proved equally as controversial. Reports suggest that as many . as 90 per cent of the residents on the street are dependent on benefits . of one kind or another. Channel . 4 and programme makers Love Productions claim the run-down, . multi-ethnic street is typical of hundreds of communities across Britain . struggling to cope with chronic economic and social decline. But . critics – who include some of the residents who originally agreed to . take part – insist Channel 4 is indulging in ‘poverty porn’ and have . accused producers of painting a false and particularly bleak picture of . life on the street. Roberts, . who is unemployed is served with an eviction notice in one episode and . is later shown advising one of her fellow residents to ‘claim your . effing benefits, that’s what I effing say’. She . has since, however, become one of the programme’s most vocal critics . and recently accused producers of treating her and her fellow residents . ‘like scum’. The row over . the programme has even reached the House of Commons, with Iain Duncan .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . From the moment it was announced last August, Barbie's new $2million deal with Girl Scouts stirred up protest for being 'insidious' and 'product placement at its worst.' And this week, amid re-ignited controversy, Mattel's Barbie Loves Girl Scouts doll finally hits stores. Sporting a bright pink and green Girl Scouts uniform, and complete with sassy high-heeled hiking boots, she also debuts the first corporately sponsored uniform patch in Girl Scouts' history. 'Barbie is basically a terrible role model for girls,' Dr Susan Linn, founder of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood told NBC's Today show. 'She's not about what the Girl Scouts' principles are, which have to do with leadership and courage.' Causing a stir: The new Barbie Loves Girl Scouts doll hits stores this week, angering Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood - a consumer group which claims Barbie is against Girl Scouts' principles . Uniform: The dolls wear their hair scraped back and sport a tote (left) and high-heeled hiking boots (right) Ms Linn, a psychologist who teaches at Harvard Medical School, is at the forefront of the protest against the Barbie Loves Girl Scouts doll; having already tried and failed to get the Girl Scouts organization to drop the partnership last year. 'Holding Barbie, the quintessential fashion doll, up as a role model for Girl Scouts simultaneously sexualizes young girls, idealizes an impossible body type, and undermines the Girl Scouts’ vital mission to build ""girls of courage, confidence and character,""' said Ms Linn. The Barbie Loves Girl Scouts doll, which is available as a blonde, brunette or as an African-American, comes alongside an activity book and carries a tote which reads: 'Goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills, business ethics.' The range: The consumer group claims that Barbie 'sexualizes young girls, idealizes an impossible body type, and undermines the Girl Scouts’ vital mission to build ""girls of courage, confidence and character' Badge: The accompanying patch (pictured) is the first corporately sponsored uniform patch in Girl Scouts' history, and can be purchased rather than 'earned' It also comes with a Girl Scouts uniform patch bearing the slogan: 'Be anything, do everything.' Aimed . at six to eight-year-olds, it is not typical of the organization's usual . patches in that it can be purchased, rather than being 'earned.' Consumer watchdog: Dr Susan Linn (pictured) attempted to get the deal axed last year, but failed . But . Girl Scouts' chief communications executive maintained that its deal . with Mattel will be a great thing for the 102-year-old organization, . which aims to 'make the world a better place,' according to its mission . statement. 'Girls and moms alike associate this doll with the outdoors, camping, giving back in your community,' she said. 'We think that those are really positive messages to be sending to all of our girls.' Notably, . the Girl Scouts secured a healthy $2million of funding from Mattel as . part of the deal - albeit to implement Barbie-themed initiatives - at a . time when the organization was forced to shed a quarter of its workforce . due to financial woes. For . Mattel, the brand insisted that its partnership with Girl Scouts was a . 'good fit,' claiming it was 'inspiring girls' imagination and showing . them they can become anything they want to be.' And Barbie has certainly been a lot of things. In her 55 years as one of most influential dolls in American history, she has been outfitted for more than 135 different jobs, one of the more recent being Entrepreneur Barbie, released last week. 'Girls and moms alike associate this doll with the outdoors, camping, giving back in your community' Designed by Mattel with the assistance of eight real-life female entrepreneurs, the $12.99 tech-savvy doll comes equipped with a tablet, a smartphone and a laptop case, is now available on Amazon. The Barbie Loves Girls Scouts doll hits shelves this week, and although its official recommended retail price has not yet been revealed, it is already available from select sellers on Amazon, priced at $59.99 for the African-American doll, $66.95 for the brunette, and $69.95 for the blonde.","Mattel gave Girl .

"By . Morwenna Jones . Morwenna Waters has witnessed first-hand how both men and women fuel sexism at Cambridge University . Scandal-ridden ‘drinking societies’ at Oxford and Cambridge Universities have been around for centuries – but their reputations have never been lower. One study has suggested almost half of female students at Cambridge have reported being groped, pinched or touched, a drinking society from the same university has been filmed marching down a street chanting ‘rape’, and a boycott row has engulfed the Oxford Union whose president is accused of rape. I learned about these elite societies during my days as a naive, unworldly fresher at Cambridge when I dated one of their members. The evidence was all around me in drinking games that entertained men but demeaned women. Yet so many women – particularly those new to university – agreed to take part. Most recently there has been ‘whaling’, where young men compete to find, bed and ‘harpoon’ the ugliest girl in a bar or club. Then there is Fat Girl Rodeo, where boys grab a curvaceous young woman, threaten to rape her, and hang on as long as they can as she desperately tries to throw them off. Thank goodness I’ve never been a victim of either of these ‘games’, though their existence proves that drinking societies remain puerile and disgusting, and often regard women as playthings who exist merely for sex and entertainment. Sadly, my fellow females don’t seem to be doing much better. While male societies call themselves The Epics, The Cobblers, The Tribe, or The Speakers, female societies include The Harlots, The Ho-Hoes, Gymslips and Slags, and a host of other innuendo-derived titles. The names tell you everything you need to know about the sexism, attitudes and expectations that define drinking societies as much as they define current student culture. The girls who meet these expectations are the girls, already blinded by alcohol, who stand up and confess to such things as taking part in a threesome or sleeping with a lecturer and are then given a ‘drinking fine’ – an alcoholic drink as punishment. Why do the women admit to these things, or agree to spend an evening dressed in tiny pink hotpants and a sports bra; or allow guys they’ve known for three hours to drink tequila shots out of their belly button as they lie submissively on a curry-strewn table? Female students at Cambridge lick cream off the bodies of male students in a raucous drinking game . High jinks: These games have affected the reputations of Oxford and Cambridge more than ever before . One explanation may be that, for that moment, when you stand half-naked on top of a table and down whatever lethal alcoholic concoction you’ve been given, you’re the centre of attention. You’re accepted as one of the party people and something exclusive to the ‘cool kids’ at university, which is what you want to be. In fact, you are merely part of the show. The next morning you wake up, mortified that you exposed your slightly too flabby post-Christmas holiday stomach to the diners at Curry King with a horrible awareness that you’ve successfully and simultaneously established yourself as both a ‘good-time girl’ and a complete idiot. Would you want future employers seeing your behaviour? Or your mother? Would you even want a photo up on Facebook? Then there are traditions such as the Cambridge Pitt Club’s one of sending anonymous invitations to a dubiously selected handful of first-year girls. There was also uproar over the actions of The Black Cynets at Oxford, who invited the college’s prettiest freshers to a ‘fox hunt’ where they would dress as foxes and be hunted by drunken and predatory males. It was cancelled after provoking a furore. Such activities feed the public a damaging image of our universities. The Pitt Club, The Wyverns and the notorious Bullingdon Club at Oxford present a picture of smug, self-regarding students revelling in port, cigars and striped bow ties. All of them are male. Of course, there are double standards. It goes without saying that a banterous twentysomething, bow tie-sporting male student can take his top off and chant loudly while downing a bottle of wine without raising an eyebrow. When you strip down and drink lethal alcoholic concoctions, you're accepted as one of the party people . But for a female student to do the same thing is quite a different matter. Some women might shrug off the resulting stigma or the ‘reputation’ they have sprouted overnight. But what about the rest of us? Such sexist antics – and the women who are lured into indulging them – make it hard for us to be taken seriously in the country’s leading seats of learning. It is too easy to say, ‘If you don’t want to do it, then don’t’. There are occasions when I and many of my friends have done exactly that. We’ve watched while our peers have stripped or downed dubious-looking alcoholic beverages believing ‘it’s just a bit of fun’. But the consequences for all young women can be much more serious. I have one friend who now refuses to . socialise with a college drinking society having once been encouraged by . them to strip and show off her slightly larger-than-average breasts to . the rest of the room. They think women exist purely for sex . I . have another friend who continually worries about her ‘reputation’ preceding her on the rare occasions when she goes on proper dates after . she earned herself the nickname ‘the college bench-press’. These girls could have said no, but the peer-pressure surrounding them would almost definitely have subsequently labelled them as that worst of all epithets – boring. Oxbridge drinking societies are marked by stories like these. Scarily, they are regarded as normal. They are also ‘normal’ across the rest of the country. Go to Leeds, Manchester, Reading, London or any other university in the country and you will find some sexist behaviour in the university’s drinking culture. It’s become a given in an age where websites such as uniladmag.com have more than 500,000 likes on Facebook, and in which ‘fancy-dress’ is code for women wearing as little as possible. Yet what makes this sexism worse for Oxbridge women is our sense of injustice. It is not fair that, having been at these universities for almost as long as some of their most famous drinking societies (the Pitt Club was founded in 1830, women started at Cambridge in 1869), we are not given the same social opportunities. Women have been attending Cambridge (Kings College pictured) since 1869 and yet sexism prevails . The member of the elite drinking club I dated went to £80-a-head dinners. He met influential, interesting, talented and clever men from all over the world, purely because they were ‘old boys’. He built up a hefty network of contacts that guaranteed that he would be safe from unemployment. Have I been given any of these opportunities? Of course not. Am I going to be? Not unless I’m a scantily clad guest of one of these drinking society dinners. Where is the Plath Club at Cambridge? Or the Thatcher Club at Oxford? At Cambridge there is the Beard Society and The Misfits. However, the former is a very small group named after the classicist Mary Beard and the latter is better known for having members that are very good at finding boyfriends from among the upper echelons of the university rugby team. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want young women to emulate the scandalous behaviour of the boys. In fact most of us at university would simply prefer that their wild nights of drinking didn’t have to involve us.","Oxford and Cambridge Universities' reputations have never been lower .

"By . Kelly Strange . As a teenager, Liberty Caton despised the reflection staring back at her in the mirror. She refused to pose for photographs, covering her boyish frame in baggy t-shirts and shunning the pretty dresses and strappy tops her friends wore. Her confidence was shattered when doctors revealed her twisted spine was the result of the medical condition scoliosis. But now 23, Miss Caton has transformed her image, after years of being forced to wait for the life-changing surgery she could only have once fully grown. Liberty Caton suffered scoliosis, a severe curvature of the spine, as a teenager, leaving her body twisted and one leg considerably longer than the other (left). Today the 23-year-old finally feels comfortable posing for photos after surgery to transform her body (right) And to top her new look off, the customer services agent, had a boob job to boost her chest from a 30B to a 30FF, giving her the feminine curves she has always dreamed of. Miss Caton's scoliosis was so severe that one leg grew shorter than the other and her shoulders and ribs protruded at different angles. She said: ’Once I hated my body so much I couldn’t bare to look in the mirror. Now I love it and I’m incredibly proud of what I’ve been through to be able to say that. 'It's been rebuilt and I'm delighted with the results. 'My condition stopped me feeling attractive for many years. But now after the operations I could not be happier. 'My friends and family call me Iron Woman but it was the implants that really gave me the figure I craved.' Miss Caton, from Slough, Berkshire, was in her teens when she first began to notice her shape was at odds with her peers. She said: ‘My back was stooped and then I noticed my rib cage seemed twisted.’ Over time, her condition got worse and she noticed one leg was longer than the other. Doctors told Miss Caton she would have to wait for corrective surgery until she had fully grown. In July 2009 surgeons inserted iron rods into her spine (right) to straighten her spine, (left before surgery) She said: ‘Like most self conscious . teenagers I kept myself covered up all the time to try and hide the . irregularities in my shape.' Finally she confided in her parents who made an appointment with their GP. Miss Caton was examined and referred to a specialist who confirmed she was suffering with scoliosis, an abnormal and severe curvature of the spine. It was so extreme that one leg had grown longer than the other to compensate for the twist in her frame. 'My back was stooped and then I noticed my rib cage seemed twisted... I felt very unattractive and couldn't wait to have surgery' - Liberty Caton . But consultants at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford were hopeful that Miss Caton would benefit from surgery. The solution was an operation to insert iron rods into her back to straighten it. But doctors revealed, much to Miss Caton's despair, that the operation could only be performed once she had stopped growing. She said: ‘I understood why, but it was awful being told that basically I would have to spend the remainder of my teenage years feeling unhappy and unattractive. 'While my friends wore pretty dresses and strappy tops I kept covered up in baggy clothes. I felt very unfeminine and unattractive and couldn't wait to have surgery.' Finally in July 2009 she underwent the nine-hour operation and, after a week in hospital, spent three months at home recovering. To complete her transformation Miss Caton went under the knife once more, for a boob job to boost her chest from a 30B to 30FF. She said: 'I waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but I love my appearance' She was astonished to learn she had grown three inches as a result of the successful operation, going from 5ft 6ins to 5ft 9ins. Miss Caton said: ‘It was fantastic but I knew straight away I wasn’t finished. After waiting so long I was determined to look more curvy and feminine.’ So she decided to complete her transformation with a boob job to boost her from a 30B to a 30FF. She had a consultation with a surgeon from Transform Medical Group who agreed to operate and she took out a loan to cover the £3,500 cost. 'I waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but I love my appearance now. I spent my teenage years hidden away so I'm making up for lost time' - Liberty Caton on her transformation . Miss Caton said: ‘The staff at Transform were extremely sympathetic with regards to my medical history and I felt the surgeon really understood why it was so important to me to have the operation after what I had been through.’ Following the operation last March she says her confidence has finally blossomed and she can at last enjoy being photographed. She said: ‘I built this body for me, nobody else so I don’t care what anyone thinks. I waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but I love my appearance now. ‘I can walk into a shop and pick up anything I like knowing it will fit and look nice. I threw out all my baggy clothes and now I love tight stuff and bikinis. ‘I spent my teenage years hidden away so I’m making up for lost time.’","Liberty Caton was diagnosed with scoliosis - severe curvature of the spine .

"By . Kelly Strange . Alesha Duncan has a phobia of cats which she says is ruining her life . A mother claims a rare phobia of kittens is ruining her life. Alesha Duncan, 27, from Waterloo, London, says the sight of a kitten leaves her sobbing with terror and that even a picture of one can trigger a panic attack. She says her phobia - known as ailurophobia - has ruined relationships and is now threatening friendships, but she is determined to beat it. Ms Duncan, a fulltime mother to Sapphire, 13 and Luke, two, said: ‘I know most people love little kittens but to me they are just evil. There is nothing cute about them at all. ‘I hate the way they are allowed to just roam around the streets staring at people and hiding. It’s terrifying. ‘I don’t see them as harmless and cute. They are just little monsters. I absolutely hate everything about them.’ She says her phobia is debilitating because the animals are almost impossible to avoid, meaning she is confined to the house is she sees one and refuses to visit anyone who has a kitten as a pet. She claims her phobia has already ended one long-term relationship because her former partner had a cat - meaning she was unable to visit. She said: ‘It was going really well between us but once I found out about the cat, I kept making excuses not to go and see him. ‘I was too embarrassed to admit the real reason so would invent reasons to cancel. ‘I would have invited him to my house but I wasn't ready for him to meet my child, so in the end there was nowhere we could relax together. ‘He couldn’t understand what was wrong with me and when I finally admitted the truth to him the damage was already done. We’d had too many arguments and decided to split. ‘He was sympathetic but people who like cats just cannot understand why I find them so scary.’ Ms Duncan thinks her phobia may have been triggered by an event she witnessed as a child aged eight. Ms Duncan (pictured with her daughter, Sapphire, and son, Luke) thinks she developed the phobia after seeing her father being attacked by a cat when she was a child . She remembers her father taking her to visit her grandmother who owned a cat. She said: ‘Dad was playing with the cat like he usually he did and suddenly it just turned and scratched him across the face. Ailurophobia is a fear of cats which causes undue anxiety. It occurs even though sufferers know their fear is irrational. Some sufferers fear a bite or a scratch from a cat. Others are scared of the 'evil mystique' of the creatures. Symptoms can include breathlessness, sweating, shaking, heart palpitations and a fear of dying. The phobia is often triggered by an unpleasant experience involving cats, but some people develop it with no obvious trigger. Treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy. ‘There was blood dripping down his cheek and dad looked shocked. I was so scared I burst into tears. I never looked at them the same again after that.’ Initially she avoided cats without too much issue, but as she grew older her fear worsened. She said: ‘I noticed it got much worse after I had my eldest daughter. 'I wouldn’t let her touch cats because I was worried about her getting scratched like my father had. ‘Then as my fear of her getting hurt grew I just started avoiding them all together.’ Ms Duncan would scour the streets from her flat window before daring to leave home to make sure it was free of cats. If she spotted one she would stay inside until up to an hour after it had gone to make sure the coast was clear. If she ventured out and saw one she would turn and run the other way. Now she claims even the sound of a cat screeching at night sets her palms sweating. She said: ‘My children have grown up . with this so they understand mummy hates cats. 'I don’t want them to be . scared of them so I try to play it down if I see one but there’s no way I . could handle seeing them touch one. Ms Duncan says that when she goes out her daughter, Sapphire (pictured with her little brother, Luke), has to act as a lookout to make sure there aren't any cats nearby . ‘My eldest is so lovely, she knows what a state I get into so she acts as a look out look, warning me if there is a cat ahead so we can go a different way. ‘When we go to the park they’ll have a quick check around for me before we sit down but if one comes along we have to go.’ Now she refuses to date cat owners but says her phobia has also threatened friendships. Recently one of her closest friends . needed support after an illness so Ms Duncan agreed to stay for the . night if the cat was locked away. But she ended up fleeing in the middle of . the night when it wandered into the room she was in. She said: . ‘I wanted to be there for my friend. But I just couldn't handle being in . the same house as the cat. She needed me and I couldn’t be there for . her because of this phobia. ‘I felt awful. I haven’t been able to go back since and I hate knowing I am letting her down when she needs me. Ms Duncan says she is terrified of her children (pictured) being hurt by a cat . Ms Duncan says that before she leaves her flat she has to look out of a window to make sure there are no cats nearby. If she spots one, she will not leave her home for at least an hour to make sure it has gone . ‘There are other friends I’ve grown apart from because they have cats. It’s such a shame. My heart sinks when I meet someone new and they tell me they have a cat. ‘I think ""why can’t you have a dog""? They are so much nicer. I can’t understand how anyone would want to share their home with something that skulks around and could scratch them at any time.’ But she has so far been unable to seek treatment because she’s terrified it will involve her having to face her fear by holding a cat or kitten. She said: ‘I just cannot cope with the thought of having to try and touch one so I have avoided it. ‘I’ve tried to discuss it with my GP but I just feel such a fool and I’m worried I won’t be taken seriously. People I have told have usually laughed but it’s not funny to me. ‘I want to beat it because it affects my everyday life so much but the truth is I’m too scared. ‘I hope talking about it now helps others understand how terrifying a phobia can be - even one of cute little kittens.’","Alesha Duncan, 27, from London, suffers from ailurophobia - a fear of cats .

"By . Kelly Strange . A model has issued a stark warning to women tempted by holiday romances. She ditched her career in readiness to become the perfect traditional wife to her Turkish lover, but later discovered he already had one. Sophie Birch, 21 of Oldham, gave up photo shoots and catwalk shows when her partner whom she met on holiday branded her work ‘ disrespectful.’ Sophie Birch of Manchester fell pregnant by her Turkish lover Sabri Tasken before finding out that he already had a wife . Sophie was only 19 when she met barman Sabri, then 24, in Altinkum in 2011 . And when 26-year-old Sabri said he wanted to marry her, smitten Sophie agreed to start wearing frumpy long dresses to please him. The couple, who got together in 2011 when Sophie was 19, decided to start a family together and Sophie had been pregnant for ten weeks gone when she discovered her partner already had a wife. Tragically she miscarried shortly after, blaming the shock. Sophie said: ‘I’m telling my story because I want other women to be wary. I thought it would never happen to me. ‘I . knew Turkish men had a bad reputation but I had known Sabri for years . and was sure he was different. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case. ‘I feel like a fool but I’m happy again now and hope others can learn by my mistake.’ Sophie, pictured at home with the positive pregnancy test, tried for a baby at Sabri's suggestion, only to be told my his family that he already had a wife . Sophie clicked with barman Sabri Tasken, then 24 in Altinkum in 2011. She had already known him as a family friend for three years as her uncle owned a nearby holiday apartment. Sophie says: ‘Because he had been a friend of the family for so long my guard was down. We all thought we could trust him.’ ‘In fact I . thought the women having holiday romances with the locals were being . daft. I would never have agreed to go out with Sabri if I hadn’t known . him so long.’ At first he was the perfect gentleman and the couple spent hours talking on Skype while they were apart. Sophie was working hard to forge a career as a model and supplementing her earnings at a supermarket. But Sabri soon made it clear that he wanted her to stop modeling. She . explains: ‘He started to go quiet when I spoke about shoots I’d been . doing. I was shocked because he’d known me for three years and during . all that time I’d made no secret of my modeling. ‘He said it was disrespectful to pose for other men now we were a couple.’ At first she refused to quit but Sabri made it clear there was no future unless she did. Sophie . says: ‘I was young and in love and thought I had met the man I would . spend my life with. I was reluctant but I knew all relationships come . with some sacrifice. ‘If it was going to work I had to respect the fact that our cultures were very different and my career was a problem.’ She quit photo shoots and instead took on more hours at the supermarket. But it wasn’t long before he was making more demands. Having known Sabri previously through her uncle, Sophie let her guard down and the two would spend hours talking on Skype while they were apart . ‘He was . unhappy about me going out drinking. He didn’t approve of my Western . friends. He said I needed to pay more respect to the Turkish culture for . us to be together.’ During . one visit he also asked her to stop drinking. She says: ‘I wasn’t big . drinker anyway so when I could see how much it meant to him I agreed.’ Next he suggested she also stop wearing revealing clothes like shorts, dresses and vest tops. Sophie . said: ‘I thought he was joking because he’d known me for so long but he . pointed out some leggings and long tops and said I’d look much better . dressed in them.’ Sabri soon became controlling over Sophie, asking her to stop drinking and spending time with her Western friends (pictured with Sophie on a night out) as well as end her modelling career . When she flew back to visit in May 2013 he even wrapped a scarf around her head to make her look more like a local women. Sophie said: ‘He was so pleased he even took a photo saying it really suited me.’ Months later on her 21st birthday in October 2013 Sophie flew back to Turkey. Sabri had arranged a hotel suite and surprised her by suggesting they try for a baby. She . says: ‘ It felt like all the sacrifices I had made for the relationship . were worth it because we were going to get out happy ending. ‘I was in love and now we decided to have a baby. It seemed perfect.’ Weeks later she learned she was pregnant and initially Sabri seemed delighted. But days later he disappeared from Facebook and stopped answering calls and emails. When Sabri ended all contact, a worried Sophie began contacting his family, only to be told to leave Sabri alone because he was already married . She says: ‘ I was frantic with worry. My first thought was that he had been hurt.’ So with that in mind she started contacting family members for answers. What she didn’t expect was a reply telling her to leave Sabri alone because he was already married. Sophie says: ‘I was so shocked I could not speak. I just stared at the screen thinking it must be a mistake. I thought I had known everything about him. After that all contact ended but Sophie still treasured the idea of becoming a mother. But tragically she miscarried four months into the pregnancy blaming the stress. Six months on Sophie is positive about moving forward, but cruel Sabri admitted he had no intention of marrying her. He said: ‘Sophie was a holiday romance. She knew I would never marry an English girl. Our cultures are too different. ‘It would not work and I told her that from day one. I never loved her. I used to like her but not now.’","Sophie was 19 when she met barman Sabri, then 24 in Altinkum in 2011 .

"By . Kelly Strange . Many people would think expecting to have both brains and beauty would be wishful thinking. Not so one Mensa member who says having a nose job was the cleverest thing he has ever done. Owen Cheshire, 21, from Southampton, had cosmetic surgery before graduating to make sure his large nose didn’t stop him being offered a job. Owen Cheshire, 21, from Southampton, had a nose job because his large nose was damaging his self-confidence. He is pictured (left) before the operation and (right) after it . Now he says that thanks to the operation his confidence is finally as high as his IQ. Mr Cheshire, who has an IQ of 132, said: ‘It was a no brainer for me. I wanted to enter the job market at my best and I couldn’t be that with confidence issues about my appearance. ‘I hated meeting new people or having photographs taken. I shied back from the spotlight. ‘But now I’m confident and ready to tackle anything. It’s simple logic, feeling less ugly has made me braver and happier. It’s nice not to be laughed at because of my nose.’ Mr Cheshire first started dreaming of cosmetic surgery as a self-conscious teenager. He said: ‘I inherited a large bump in my nose which runs in the family. Mr Cheshire (pictured on his graduation day after his operation) says he feared his large nose would prevent him being offered a job. He says having the surgery also made him confident in his graduation photos . Mr Cheshire says having the surgery was the best thing he has ever done. He is pictured after the operation . ‘I tried to just forget about it and get on with things because we all know there are more important things to life, but it did cause me embarrassment and make me feel self-conscious.’ Despite being bullied over his appearance he still passed 11 GCSEs with flying colours and won a place to study A-levels at college. He also went on to read for a degree at Southampton Solent University. He said: ‘My confidence grew slightly but I still hated talking to people side on and despised having my photograph taken. Mr Cheshire (pictured after the operation) is a member of Mensa with an IQ of 132 . ‘I never felt particularly attractive so I suppose because of that I wasn’t the most outgoing or dynamic person in the room.’ So he focused on his studies and was thrilled to win membership to the prestigious Mensa academy in 2012 with an IQ of 132 - 132 is the IQ pass mark for joining Mensa. But despite his top credentials as he neared the end of his degree in media and marketing, he feared his nose would hold him back as he competed for jobs in a difficult market. He said: ‘You don’t have to be a genius to work out that in the current job market only the very best will win the few jobs available. ‘I felt sure that couldn’t be me because I simply wasn’t the best I could be because of my confidence. ‘It’s a complete myth that only shallow or stupid people care about the way they look. It’s not shallow to want to make the best of yourself.’ He began researching surgeons and within a month of finishing his degree in May 2013 was on the operating table at Transform in London. He said: ‘I researched the companies thoroughly and all claimed to have the best surgeons, something I would expect from a surgery provider anyway. But Transform seemed to offer the best after care and support.’ The surgeon agreed to shave off the bump and smooth the tip for a more streamlined nose at a cost of £4,000. Mr Cheshire said: ‘It was a lot of money but I saw it as an investment in myself and my future.’ He . was instantly delighted with the results. He said: ‘Even with the . bandages on I could see a huge difference. I knew it would only improve . as the swelling receded. I absolutely loved it. Mr Cheshire, pictured (left) before the surgery and (right) after it, said: 'Now I’m confident and ready to tackle . anything. It’s simple logic, feeling less ugly has made me braver and . happier' Mr Cheshire (pictured on his graduation day after his surgery) says he is now confident entering the jobs market and feels his chance is as good as anyone else's . ‘When the bandages came off I just looked at my side profile and thought: ‘Great, I’m not really ugly anymore. ’ As he recovered he was thrilled to hear he’d won a job on a graduate training scheme that he’d applied for before the surgery, but says his new nose meant he was able to start the position in August 2013 full of enthusiasm and vigour. And months later when he graduated in November 2013 he enjoyed posing for pictures in his gown. He said: ‘I hated cameras before and would never have posed for photographs. It was wonderful to enjoy it.’ Now his graduate scheme is coming to an end and Mr Cheshire says he’s confident enough to face battling for another job thanks to his nose. He said: ‘Everyone knows how tough it is for graduates to find work right now. I’m so pleased I made the decision to have surgery with Transform because now my chances are just as good as the next mans.’ For more information about Transform visit www.transforminglives.co.uk   or call 0800 6556406 .","Owen Cheshire inherited the large, bumpy nose which runs in his family .

"By . Larisa Brown . and Kelly Strange . A baby who was so big she became trapped during birth was saved by medics who broke her arm. Weighing 10lb 15oz, Poppy Screen got stuck midway through the delivery, leaving her unable to breathe – and doctors feared she would be stillborn. But her life was saved after a quick-thinking consultant snapped her limb to free her and then battled for 12 minutes to get her breathing. Healthy: Poppy, now eight months old, has suffered no lasting damage from her maternity ward ordeal. Her mother Lucy Screen, 26, thought she was losing her daughter when she saw tears in in a midwife's eyes . Poppy’s mother Lucy Screen, 26, from Abertillery in Gwent, South Wales, said: ‘We knew Poppy was on the big side but we didn’t know how big or I would not have risked a natural delivery. ‘She almost died and we were warned that because she had been starved of oxygen for so long she may have suffered brain damage. Thank goodness she is perfect. But we know how lucky we have been. ‘I think they were a bit worried when they told me they’d had to break Poppy’s arm, but I couldn’t thank them enough … She wouldn’t be here today if they hadn’t broken her arm.’ In May last year, 37 weeks into Mrs Screen’s pregnancy, doctors induced labour due to complications with her blood type. But having had their first child Rosalie two years earlier, she and husband Jonathon were expecting a straightforward delivery.  Mrs Screen said: ‘I’d been told the second birth is always easier because your body knows what to do.’ The labour progressed quickly and everything went according to plan until after the baby’s head had been delivered. ‘I could see people’s faces change as they tried to deliver the rest of her but they couldn’t,’ Mrs Screen said. ‘They kept moving me around and I was pushing with all my might but it made no difference.’ Midwives called for emergency help after they suspected a case of shoulder dystocia, which means one or both of the baby’s shoulders get stuck behind the mother’s pelvis. The condition – which is common among larger babies – can be fatal. It became clear that both of Poppy’s shoulders were trapped and she was being starved of oxygen. Mrs Screen said: ‘Alarm bells were ringing and people were running in and out like a scene from a film … I knew we were losing her because I could see tears in the eyes of one of the midwives. I begged them to do anything to save her.’ It was then that a consultant snapped the unborn baby’s arm, freeing her so she could be delivered. X-ray: The break allowed trapped Poppy to be delivered after her shoulders got trapped behind her mothers pelvis and she began to suffocate . Mrs Screen said she ‘went into shock’ because she was so convinced that her child had died. But in the corner of the room medics continued CPR on the baby until finally, after 12 minutes, she took her first breath. Poppy was rushed to special baby care while medics were left to explain to her parents that her arm had been broken. Mrs Screen said: ‘We didn’t care at all about that. We were just so grateful that they hadn’t given up on her.’ But the couple were warned that Poppy may have suffered brain damage after being unable to breathe for so long. She was transferred to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport for pioneering cooling treatment to reduce the risk of brain injury. Her mother said: ‘I broke down when I saw her. ‘She looked perfect other than a splint on her little broken arm and lots of nail marks where people had tried so hard to free her.’ Weak: Poppy pictured in hospital with a tiny splint. Her parents could not hold her for the first five days . The anxious parents held vigil while Poppy was treated over the next 72 hours. She began to breathe unaided and five days after the birth her parents were allowed to hold her for the first time. ‘It felt like a miracle,’ Mrs Screen said. ‘She had almost died but all she had to show for it was a broken arm.’ Poppy was discharged five weeks later and is now a perfectly healthy eight-month-old girl. Mrs Screen is now calling for increased growth screening in the later stages of pregnancy to prevent incidents like her daughter’s. She is also walking 32 miles to raise money for Royal Gwent Hospital. To donate, visit http://www.justgiving.com/lucy-screen .","Poppy Screen got stuck as she was being born and couldn't breathe .

"By . Kelly Strange . A devastated couple cancelled their order for a pram and a cot when they were told their unborn baby had a one per cent chance of survival – but were elated when she was born full of life. Natalie Brown, 32, and her partner Peter Gordon, 42, had been told a rare terminal condition meant their daughter, Elsie, would either be stillborn or die shortly after birth. But to everyone’s complete shock, the baby was born full of life. Natalie Brown and her partner Peter Gordon were told baby Elsie had just a one per cent chance of survival . In fact, Elsie proved so well that she was discharged for her overjoyed parents to take home just five days later. Ms Brown, from Evesham, in Worcestershire, said: ‘It feels like a miracle after being told they were 99 per cent sure she would die. In the end we had to try and accept it and prepare for the worst. ‘We had even started to arrange her funeral. I have to keep pinching myself. I can’t believe how lucky we have been to have her home. ‘We had no cot and pram because everything had gone back. When doctors tell you there is just a one per cent chance your baby will live you need to be prepared for the worst.’ Now the couple, who both work as teaching assistants, are waiting for the original terminal diagnosis to be ruled out as they suspect Elsie’s condition is in fact a much less serious joint disorder affecting just her legs. But Ms Brown has praised medics for the care she received and says she is just delighted and relieved to have her daughter alive. Before she was born, it was believed that Elsie had a rare and terminal genetic condition . Doctors were amazed when Elsie was delivered full of life and they now believe she actually has a much less serious condition which just affects her legs . The drama started at the 20-week scan when the parents-to-be were told there were abnormalities with their baby daughter’s legs. Ms Brown said: ‘Scans revealed she had club feet and her knees and hips were fixed in a contracted position, a bit like a kneeling Buddha. Nobody could tell us why.’ The couple were given the option to terminate their pregnancy then, but refused to make any decisions until they knew what was causing the abnormalities. Foetal akinesia deformation sequence is a condition which causes reduced foetal movement and growth. It also causes the joints to seize, facial abnormalities, underdevelopment of the lungs and other developmental abnormalities. About 30 per cent of babies with the condition are stillborn while most of the rest only survive for a short time after birth. They die because of complications caused by the underdevelopment of their lungs. It can be inherited but in some cases it is caused by a random gene mutation. Source: Office of Rare Diseases Research . Ms Brown explains: ‘There was no way we were going to abort our baby just because she had club feet or problems with her legs. ‘Disabilities are not a barrier to a happy life. But the doctors were concerned that the disabilities may have been caused by a genetic condition with much more serious implications.’ Eventually tests pointed to a rare nerve condition called foetal akinesia deformation sequence. It’s fatal and begins by fusing limbs, before shutting down vital organs causing death in unborn babies. If the babies do survive birth, they only live a short time after. Ms Brown says: ‘We were devastated. No test could tell us for certain that is what Elsie had. ‘We would just have to wait and see how it progressed for the rest of the pregnancy. I was advised to look out for reduced movement, a sign other limbs were fusing.’ The couple remained positive, but when at 32-weeks their baby’s movements slowed dramatically, Ms Brown returned to the hospital for more scans fearing the worst. Tragically, they revealed that the baby’s arms were now still, leading medics to conclude she did have the condition and it was spreading. Ms Brown said: ‘We were taken into a side room after the scan and told our baby had a less than one per cent chance of survival. The couple were told that there was a problem after prenatal scans revealed abnormalities in Elsie's legs . Mr Gordon and Ms Brown decided not to terminate the pregnancy so as to give Elsie a chance but they cancelled orders for a pram and a cot and started to plan her funeral . ‘We cried and cried because we hadn’t given up on her but now it felt like all hope had gone. I desperately wanted to believe they were wrong but you cannot ignore what the professionals are telling you. ‘The only comfort we had was that we had given her every chance by not terminating the pregnancy at 20-weeks.’ The couple, who already have three children between them by past relationships, faced the heart-breaking task of telling Ms Brown’s daughters, aged five and seven, and Mr Gordon’s daughter, aged eight. Ms Brown says: ‘The girls were so excited about having a baby sister. But after being told she had a one per cent chance of life we had to try and prepare them in some way for the fact Elsie wasn’t coming home. ‘We called them together and gently told them that their sister would be going straight to heaven to watch over us all. ‘The girls were confused and upset but very accepting in that way that children can be.’ Elsie was eventually delivered by C-section and doctors were stunned when she started crying. She was taken to the special care baby unit for monitoring as doctors started to reconsider her diagnosis . Amazingly, the couple (pictured before the birth) were able to take Elsie home just five days after her birth . Heartbreakingly, they then had to prepare for a birth and a funeral. Ms Brown said: ‘I just couldn’t face it so Peter spoke to the undertakers about our situation so they were ready to organise everything when the time came.’ The couple also cancelled their delivery of a new pram and cot and packed away the new nursery. Ms Brown said: ‘It was too painful to see everything in there knowing it would never be used.’ At 39-weeks Ms Brown was admitted for an induction at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital. The parents agreed that their baby should be offered comfort care only to ease any suffering in her final moments. Ms Brown said: 'It feels like a miracle after being told they were 99 per cent sure she would die' Elsie is now 11 weeks old and she is thriving despite her initial terrible prognosis . Ms Brown said: ‘It was heart-breaking to be discussing things like that while I was in labour. All I hoped was that she might live long enough for us to meet her and have a cuddle.’ It was for this reason that Ms Brown opted to have her labour monitored, meaning if the baby showed signs of distress action would be taken to assist her delivery. She said: ‘Because nobody expected her to live they said they were happy for me not to be monitored. But I felt I needed to know if my baby was coming into the world alive or dead even if she wasn’t going to live long. ‘We had got through the whole pregnancy, I didn’t want her to die during birth if there was a chance I got to hold her, if only for a few minutes.’ Finally, after an 18 hour labour and with the baby in distress, she was rushed into theatre for an emergency C-section. Ms Brown said: ‘I thought it was the end. But when they lifted her out she was crying and moving her arms and basically doing all the things we had been warned she wouldn’t do.’ Ms Brown said: 'We are in no way at all angry about what has happened, just so pleased that they were wrong or Elsie wouldn't be here today' They were supposed to hand her to me to pass away in my arms but her cries seemed to be getting stronger. ‘I was exhausted but kept thinking: “They’ve got it wrong. She’s not dying or they would have given her to me by now”.’ Eventually she was briefly shown to her shocked parents and rushed to special baby care for assessment. Ms Brown recalls: ‘Her eyes were wide open looking around. It wasn’t what I expected at all.’ Finally the couple went to see their daughter who was breathing unaided but being monitored closely. Ms Brown said: ‘We were astonished to be told things were looking good and they were very optimistic. Apart from the issue with her legs there appeared to be nothing wrong with her.’ Just five days later they took her home. Ms Brown laughs: ‘We had nothing ready for her but none of that mattered. We just couldn’t believe we had our baby home. The couple say their other daughters are delighted with their little sister . ‘Our daughters were over the moon and kept asking if Elsie had changed her mind about living in heaven. I told them “yes she has”.’ Elsie is now 11 weeks old and is thriving. Consultants are yet to make an alternative diagnosis but have told her parents that they are confident she no longer fits the criteria for foetal akinesia deformation sequence. Ms Brown said: ‘We are in no way at all angry about what has happened, just so pleased that they were wrong or Elsie wouldn’t be here today. ‘It is such a rare condition and so very hard to diagnose that we know the medics were only doing their very best by telling us what all the signs pointed to. ‘Thankfully, it doesn’t appear now to be the case and we couldn’t be more delighted about that. ‘The care we have received has been absolutely amazing.’","Natalie Brown and Peter Gordon were told their baby would not survive .

"By . Katy Winter . and Kelly Strange . A woman who suffered chronic depression for 20 years says she was cured overnight – thanks to breast enhancement surgery. Mother-of-two Jill Walker, 43, says the illness that had affected most of her adult life lifted as soon as she came back from the operating theatre after having implants fitted. She says losing all her breast tissue during her second pregnancy triggered low self-confidence and a loathing for her own body. Just 12 days after receiving her redundancy package, Jill had an operation to boost her chest from a 32A (right) to a 32E (left) But having been turned down for surgery on the NHS, Ms Walker had consigned herself to a lifetime of depression. But this changed when she was made redundant from her job after 17 years of service as a traffic warden for the Met Police Service. Just 12 days after receiving her redundancy package she had an operation to boost her chest from a 32A to a 32E. She says: ‘ I think I was the only one jumping for joy when the job losses were announced because I knew it meant I could finally afford surgery. Jill says she was left with barely any breast tissue after her two pregnancies and shrank to a 32A (pictured) The mother of two is now a 32E cup and says the 'old Jill is back' Jill suffered with depression for 20 years . before a redundancy payment enabled her to pay for breast surgery, . taking her from a 32A (right) to an 32E (left) ‘I enjoyed my job but I was over the moon to be made redundant because I knew I being able to afford surgery would change my life - and it did. ‘Before the operation all I thought about was my flat chest and how odd and masculine I looked and felt with no breast tissue. ‘As soon as I came round from surgery those feelings were gone. My depression lifted. The surgery cured me. ‘People are quick to judge those who have surgery but the change in me has affected not only my life, but also those around me to. Jill Walker says that before having the operation she felt she had to wear padded bras the whole time simply to feel normal - here, she is pictured before surgery wearing a bust-enhancing bra . ‘I finally feel free of the condition that defined me for too many years. I am happy and confident at last. The old Jill is back.’ Jill, from London, lost confidence in her body after giving birth to daughter Robyn, 22 and son Alex, 20. The former ballet dancer said her chest grew from a 32 C to a 34E when she was expecting. But soon after delivery her bust withered away. Jill's life changed when she was made redundant from her job after 17 years of service as a traffic warden for the Met Police Service (pictured) She explains: ‘They shrank to practically nothing. I was left with small envelopes of skin with nipples. There was literally no breast tissue left. ‘Having been used to having a bust I felt ridiculous. I absolutely despised the way my chest looked so flat and boyish. ‘My shoulder blades were more prominent than my breasts.’ A year after her son was born Ms Walker separated from his father. She says: ‘Being single again was awful because I had no self-confidence at all. ‘I knew the root cause of it all was how I felt about my chest but there was nothing I could do.’ Jill, pictured here after surgery, was turned down by the NHS as she didn't meet the criteria so funded the operation herself from a redundancy payment . Her confidence crisis was compounded when she learned a new partner had been cheating on her with several fuller-breasted women. She says: ‘I felt less of a woman already but this just made it even worse. ‘The fact they were all big-busted women he had cheated with proved to me that I was inadequate in some way. ‘I . knew I would never feel happy again without surgery to restore my bust - . but there was no way I could afford it with small children.’ Jill eventually sought help from her GP but was turned down for breast surgery on the NHS because she did not meet the criteria. She . says: ‘I was disappointed because it was affecting my life so . negatively. It was the first thing I thought about in the morning and . remained on my mind all day. ‘I hated socialising, had no confidence and clothes looked awful on me.’ When she met her fiancé paramedic Ashley Tinham, 46, 12 years ago, Jill made it clear her breasts were a no-go area. She explains: ‘ I always wore a shirt in bed and bathed with the door shut. I just didn’t want him to see my chest.’ She believed cosmetic surgery was her only real solution, but it was financially out of reach – until she was made redundant. She says: ‘As soon as I heard the news I jumped for joy because I knew I was going to be able to have the operation at last. ‘I was over the moon. Redundancy was the best thing that ever happened to me.’ Just 12 days after receiving her payment, Jill was having surgery with Transform. She says: ‘It sounds quick but it was not a quick decision. I had been researching it for 15 years. ‘I couldn’t wait another day.’ The operation cost £3,600 but for Jill the results have been priceless. ‘I feel like me again. It was that simple. The anxiety and stress I felt non-stop left me as soon as I had it done. ‘I was happy again for the first time in years.’ She suffered with capsular contraction, which is a common complaint after breast surgery, and needed her left implant replaced last year, but Jill has remained delighted with the results. Jill, who now works in a textile factory, said:  ‘The surgeon was fantastic and the care and service I received was amazing. I can honestly say cosmetic surgery cured my depression and I have never been happier.’ For more information about Transform Cosmetic Surgery, visit the website www.transformlives.co.uk <http://www.transforminglives.co.uk>  or call 0800 655 6406.","Jill suffered depression when her breasts shrank after second pregnancy .

"By . Kelly Strange . A woman who once feared she could never have children is due to give birth to four babies in one year. Sarah Ward, 28, conceived triplets just weeks after giving birth to her first baby. They are due to be born in March when her son, Freddie, is just nine months old. Sarah Wood, 28, and her partner, Benn Smith, are due to have four babies in one year. Ms Wood conceived triplets just a few weeks after baby Freddie was born . Ms Ward, who lives with partner postal worker Benn Smith in a one bedroom house said: ‘Falling pregnant so soon after having our baby was a real shock but to find out it was triplets knocked us for six. ‘Having four babies under the age of one is going to be insane, but I cannot wait to hold them in my arms. We feel so blessed.’ The babies will be delivered in nine weeks’ time at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent when Ms Ward is 34 weeks pregnant. At first the couple, from Crayford, were told they were expecting three non-identical sons, but later scans revealed one of the babies was a girl. They have named their sons Reggie and Stanley and daughter Charley. Ms Ward says: ‘To find out one of the babies was a girl was another huge shock. It means I’ll have three princes and one little princess and our family will be complete. The triplets - two boys and a girl - are due to be delivered by C-section in March. Freddie will be just nine months old when they are born . The couple have named their triplets Charley, Stanley and Reggie. Image shows a scan of the babies . ‘I can’t believe I’ve gone from thinking I will never be a mum to giving birth to a perfect family in under a year.’ The couple started trying for a baby in September 2011 shortly after starting their relationship. As they had already been friends for years, there seemed little point in waiting to start the family they both dreamed of. But each month brought disappointment. Ms Ward explains: ‘It seemed everyone around us was becoming pregnant. I tried to be happy for them but couldn’t help wondering when it would be my turn.’ When a year had passed with no joy Ms Ward started to fear there might be something wrong and booked an appointment with her GP in September 2012. Ms Ward said: 'I can't believe I've gone from thinking I will never be a mum to giving birth to a perfect family in under a year' But the week before her appointment, her period was late. She says: ‘After waiting so long I didn’t get my hopes up. But I did a test anyway and was stunned to find out I was finally pregnant at last.’ The couple moved into their first home together – a one-bedroom privately rented house – as they awaited the arrival of their son. After a textbook pregnancy, Freddie was born on June 1 last year. Ms Ward said: ‘Freddie was such a perfect happy baby and we both loved being parents so much that we already decided we wanted another before we left hospital.’ The couple (pictured before Freddie was born) feared they would be unable to have children as it took a year for them to conceive Freddie . But because it had taken her so long to conceive, Ms Ward assumed the same would happen again. So when the couple made love again for the first time four weeks after Freddie was born they didn’t use any contraception. One month later, Ms Ward’s period was late. She says: ‘Benn laughed and made a joke about me being pregnant but of course neither of us really expected that. I thought it was just my hormones after the birth.’ But a week on she took a test which confirmed she was expecting again. Ms Ward says the couple will struggle with space and money once the babies and born as they live in a one bedroom house. However, she says they will not be short of love . Freddie was just eight weeks old. She said: ‘I was shaking. I was looking at the blue line on the stick and then at my tiny baby thinking this cannot really be happening.’ Mr Smith was equally stunned but the couple’s shock soon gave way to excitement. Mr Smith says: ‘Yes it was happening sooner than we thought but we both knew another baby would complete the family.’ Ms Ward’s bump grew rapidly and at first she put it down to becoming pregnant again so soon after having a baby. ‘I hadn’t lost any of my baby weight from Freddie and was pregnant again so I expected to be big,’ she says. But weeks later her first scan revealed the shocking reason why her bump was so large. She says: ‘I hopped onto the bed and lifted up my top. It was only a few months since I’d been in getting scanned with Freddie so I knew what to do.’ But this time the sonographer paused during the scan and asked the couple if they knew how many babies they were having. Ms Ward says: ‘It was an odd question. I’d never been asked that with Freddie so I thought it was weird. Then I twigged what she was getting at and asked her if I was having twins.’ The sonographer shook her head and replied: ‘Triplets.’ Ms Ward says: ‘I just started shaking with shock and asking her if she was sure. Benn’s mouth was hanging wide open. Neither of us could speak.’ Suddenly her huge baby bump made perfect sense. Former care worker Ms Ward says: ‘When she turned the screen towards me I could see three wriggling little shapes and I just started to cry. I couldn’t get my head around the fact there were three babies inside me as well as the one at home.’ When the due date was confirmed as April 28th 2014 Ms Ward realised it meant she would have given birth to four babies in less than one year. Ms Wood and Mr Smith (pictured when Freddie was a week old) say they feel very blessed . She says: ‘Considering I thought I wouldn’t ever be a mum at one point, to then go to having four babies felt like a miracle.’ The couple both have twins in their families, but neither had considered a multiple birth. ‘I think because I had struggled to fall pregnant we never ever thought about twins let alone triplets,’ Ms Ward says. As the news sunk in she and Mr Smith alternated between tears of shock and joy. The following week the couple were warned that being triplets put the babies at high risk of premature birth and were asked to consider terminating one. But they refused. Mr Smith says: ‘There was no way we could choose one baby to die. It would have been impossible. We loved them all already.’ Ms Ward says: 'I'll be changing 40 nappies a day and making up to 20 bottles. It's going to be manic' With regular monitoring Ms Ward’s pregnancy progressed well. She says: ‘I looked full term by 14 weeks and sometimes it feels like I’m going to burst. ‘The heartburn with one was bad enough, but with three it’s been horrendous. But it’s all worth it.’ Ms Ward is now 25 weeks pregnant. Doctors plan to deliver the babies in nine weeks’ time when she is 34 weeks pregnant. She’s already expressing breast milk in preparation for their arrival, as well as stocking up on vests and baby grows. The couple are hoping the council will find them a bigger house when the babies have been born . She says: ‘I’ll be changing 40 nappies a day and making up to 20 bottles. It’s going to be manic. ‘Freddie will only be nine months old with the triplets arrive. ‘Unfortunately we will have to bring them back to our one bedroom house because the council cannot offer us a three bedroom home until they have been born. ‘It’s going to be very cramped with four babies in a one bedroom house until we move and I’m disappointed that they cannot offer us a properly earlier. ‘But we have amazing family and friends supporting us and we cannot wait to meet our little miracles. ‘We’ll be short of space and money with four babies under one – but we’ll not be short on love.’","Sarah Ward, 28, learnt she was pregnant with triplets, who are due to be delivered by C-section in March, when baby Freddie was just eight weeks old .

"By . Kelly Strange . and Emma Innes . A motorcyclist who broke his neck and his back in a 120mph crash has stunned medics by recovering enough to train for a marathon. Club racer Nick Matthews, 47, sustained catastrophic injuries when he forgot to tighten his brakes and sped head first into a wall. Friends who witnessed the crash at the Oulton Park race circuit in Cheshire feared he was dead. Scroll down for video . Nick Matthews, 47, has defied the odds to start training for a marathon after breaking his neck and back in a 120mph motorbike crash. He also broke his collarbone, sternum, six ribs, a wrist and two fingers . But after being airlifted to hospital surgeons managed to save his life and rebuild his shattered body. However, they warned him he might not walk again. But Mr Matthews from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, proved them wrong by walking out of hospital just three weeks later. He is now training for a marathon despite his body being held together with screws and metal rods. He said: ‘My body was completely broken, but not my spirit. ‘It’s been painful and exhausting but I owe it to the guys who saved my life not to be beaten. ‘Life in a wheelchair was not an option for me. Mr Matthews crashed his bike head first into a wall of tyres in June last year. The accident happened because he forgot to tighten his brakes before heading out onto the track which meant they failed . Mr Matthews was taken to hospital by the air ambulance but friends who saw the crash thought he was dead . ‘I won’t break any records or beat any times when I run but I will cross that finish line.’ He is hoping to raise funds for the air ambulance that saved his life. The accident occured in June last year. Mr Matthews, a haulage firm manager who had been riding . at club level for five years, was preparing for a race the following day . when the accident occurred. Broken neck . Back broken in three places . Collarbone broken in two places . Six broken ribs . Collapsed lung . Broken sternum . Broken wrist . Two broken fingers . He said: ‘I’d gone to the track a day early to put my bike through road testing and do some practice laps like normal. ‘It had been checked by the circuit and was fine.’ But while he was about to tighten his brake bolts, he was then distracted and took to the circuit without doing it. Just seven minutes into his practice laps, he approached a corner at 120mph and went for his brakes. Terrifyingly, he pulled them but felt no resistance at all. In that split second, he says he knew he would probably die. Mr Matthews, whose father was killed in a motorcycle crash when he was a baby, said: ‘It was a moment of shock and horror. I pulled at the brakes and there was nothing. Blind panic washed over me.’ Mr Matthews also suffered a collapsed lung which caused him to stop breathing at the scene . Mr Matthews had to have a five-hour operation to repair his back and neck using titanium rods and screws . The terror was captured on camera thanks to a video recorder attached to his bike. He left the circuit at 120mph and went hurtling head first into a tyre wall before being crushed by his 160kg bike. Medics on the scene found him barely conscious but saved his life by inserting a chest drain when he stopped breathing. He was then airlifted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester in a critical condition where the full extent of his injuries was revealed. Doctors didn't think Mr Matthews would survive and said even if he lived, he would probably not walk again . Mr Matthews said: 'My body was completely broken, but not my spirit. It's been painful and exhausting but I owe it to the guys who saved my life not to be beaten.' Image shows a scan of his broken wrist . Not only had he broken his neck, but his back was also broken in three places as well as his collarbone, six ribs, sternum, wrist and two fingers. He had also suffered a collapsed lung. His wife, Kirsty, 38, mother to the youngest of this three children aged 19, 16 and seven, was warned he was unlikely to survive the next 24 hours. She said: ‘They told me that even if he did survive he would never walk again. This was a life changing accident. I knew Nick wouldn’t want to come round if he wasn’t going to be able to walk again, sport is his life. Mr Matthews spent three weeks in hospital before being allowed home . Mr Matthews (pictured with his wife, Kirsty, and son, Finley) has now promised that he will not return to motorbike racing - but he does hope to get back on a bike . ‘The list of injuries was terrifying. They said it would be easier to work from the top down when they started listing them to me. ‘I could tell they didn’t think there was much hope.’ But doctors managed to stabilise his breathing and seven days later he was transferred to The Salford Royal Hospital for a five-hour operation to rebuild his back using titanium rods. Surgeons also fused seven vertebrae to fix the three that were broken. Just three days later – ten days after the smash - he stood up for the first time. Mr Matthews' father was killed in a motorbike crash when he was a baby . Mr Matthews' wife, Kirsty said: 'They told me that even if he did survive he would never walk again. This was a life changing accident. I knew Nick wouldn't want to come round if he wasn't going to be able to walk again, sport is his life.' Mr Matthews is pictured with his son, Finley . He said: ‘A physiotherapist came to see and very gently helped me to the edge of the bed. ‘I put my feet down and remember thinking how cold and flat the floor felt under me. ‘Then I just stood up. It was an amazing feeling. ‘All the consultants came to look at me standing up because they couldn’t believe it. I felt like a freak show. ‘I vowed there and then that anything was possible and one day I would run a marathon. ‘One of them joked that I must be concussed from head injuries to say such a thing because running would never be possible for me again, but I meant it.’ Mr Matthews managed to stand up again just 10 days after the crash . The following day Mr Matthews took three painful steps and managed to sit in a chair on the ward. But when his wife came to visit and saw his empty bed – she feared the worst. Mr Matthews said: ‘She saw the bed empty and thought I was dead. Then when she saw me sat in the armchair she smiled and I stood up in front of her for the first time. ‘She was gobsmacked and burst into tears. It was a very emotional moment for us.’ Mr Matthews is now training for a marathon to raise money for the air ambulance that saved his life . By day 16 of his recovery, Mr Matthews was able to take enough steps to leave the ward and three weeks after the smash he stunned doctors by walking out of the hospital unaided. He says: ‘I felt like the luckiest man alive and all my friends agreed. Especially the ones who had witnessed the crash who couldn’t believe I had survived, let alone got back on my feet.’ Mr Matthews has since undergone two more operations as well as intensive physiotherapy and in January this year ran for the first time. He says: ‘I only went twice around the block but every step took all I had, but they say a marathon is more about what is in your head so I kept going.’ He can now run two continuous miles and hopes his training schedule will see him ready for the Berlin marathon in September. He will run with a group of friends for support. But he has promised his family not to ride motorcycles at club level again. He said: ‘I couldn’t put them through that worry again, not after last time.’ But he still hopes to ride motorcycles again one day. ‘My father rode a Triumph Bonneville and it’s always been a dream of mine to own one so maybe one day.’ He says: ‘My friends call me the bionic man because I am full of so much metal. ‘I owe my life to the people who saved me, rebuilt me and helped me come this far and I want to give something back by showing people what is possible and raising money for the air ambulance that got me to hospital.’ To support Mr Matthews visit www.justgiving.com/NickMatthews57 .","Nick Matthews, 47, crashed his motorbike head first into a wall of tyres after he forgot to tighten his brakes before going out on the track .

"By . Kelly Strange . A mother whose baby’s life was saved by pioneering ice therapy has told how he was defrosted on Christmas Eve for his first cuddle. Freddy Cooke did not breathe for 20 minutes after he was born and mother Nicky Symmonds was warned that even if he survived he would be severely brain damaged from lack of oxygen. But then he was given revolutionary treatment to cool his core body temperature, putting him a state of induced hypothermia, in the hope it would allow his brain to recover. Freddie Cooke had to have his core body temperature reduced to save his life after he failed to breathe for 20 minutes . Pictured with his parents Dan and Nicky, it was feared that he may have been brain damaged as a result of a lack of oxygen to the brain . Nicky, 30, says: 'When they started warming him up again we still didn’t know if it had worked. 'When they finally handed me a warm bundle to hold for the first time it felt like a true Christmas miracle that he had survived.' The treatment was such a success that Freddy was allowed home on Boxing Day and Nicky says: 'To see your baby cold and shivering goes against all your mothering instincts. You just want to wrap them up and keep them warm, but it saved his life. Words cannot express how grateful we are.' As a result of the treatment Freddy was allowed home on Boxing Day - just a few days after he was born . Freddy is now a perfectly healthy toddler and Nicky and partner Daniel Cooke will mark this Christmas by raising money to help save others. But rewind to December 20, 2011, and they were sure they had lost him when he was born lifeless at home, just 30 minutes after Nicky went into labour. She recalls: 'I was five days overdue when the contractions started but as I was a first-time mum I was expecting a very long labour.' Midwives examined her, then left for labour to progress normally. But minutes later her waters broke and Daniel called them back. They arrived just in time to deliver the baby’s head, but his shoulder got stuck and the umbilical cord snapped, starving him of oxygen. By the time he was finally born, weighing 9lb 2oz, he had stopped breathing and the medics called an ambulance. Freddy was rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, near the couple’s home in Reading, while one of the midwives tended to Nicky. Five minutes later she had a call from the ambulance crew saying Freddy had finally started breathing 20 minutes after his birth. His only hope was the cooling treatment to reduce swelling in the brain and prevent further damage. He was put on a ventilator and transferred to Oxford’s John Radcliffe hospital for treatment to begin when he was four hours old. The couple drove to the hospital, where Nicky was admitted for more treatment. But first she wanted to see her baby. His parents described their first cuddle with him on Christmas Eve as being the best present they could have wished for . His body temperature was lowered to 33C when he was wrapped in a cooling blanket pumped with freezing water . She says: 'When we saw him he was already on the ice bed. They said it was important for treatment to start within six hours of birth. 'He was wrapped in a cooling blanket which was pumped with freezing water to keep his temperature down to 33°C. Nicky Symmonds said that he was shivering and shuddering from the cold and she just wanted to protect him . 'His little hand was freezing and he was shivering and shuddering with the cold. 'Nurses assured me he couldn’t feel anything because he was sedated but I had to fight the urge to wrap him up and snuggle him.' The parents kept vigil over the next few days as Christmas loomed. Nicky, a bookshop manager, says: 'It was heartbreaking because I had bought him a little Santa suit and imagined us all at home together for his first Christmas. 'Now all I could do was pray that he would live. I didn’t even think about Christmas.' After 72 hours it was time to slowly warm Freddy up. Only then could they tell if the treatment had worked. Daniel, 29, a lettings manager, says: 'We were warned it was a critical time as he might suffer a seizure or relapse. It was terrifying.' Miraculously as he 'defrosted' over the next 12 hours Freddy started to move his legs and cry — signs that he had not suffered brain damage. Nicky says: 'The doctors could not believe it. He had been deprived of oxygen for 20 minutes. It was unheard of for him to be responding so well.' Finally, at 4pm on Christmas Eve, the couple were able to hold their baby for the first time. Nicky says: 'Tears were rolling down my face. He was still covered in wires and tubes but he was warm, his heart was beating. 'After what I had witnessed when he was born it felt like a true Christmas miracle. It was like he had been brought back to life.' Freddy had to 'defrost' for 12 hours after his temperature was dropped and eventually he started to move his legs and cry - a sign that he had not suffered brain damage . Freddy stayed in the special care baby unit that night but on Christmas Day nurses took him to Nicky and Daniel on the post-natal ward. They had even dressed him in his red Christmas babygrow. Nicky recalls: 'It was the best present in the world. We were able to spend all Christmas afternoon cuddling him and holding him as a family.' Now the parents cannot wait for Christmas 2013, as Freddy has finally been given the all-clear. Nicky says: 'He is a miracle — and the midwives who refused to give up that day are true angels.' Last year Nicky launched a campaign, Cool To Save A Life, to raise funds for cooling equipment in hospitals.

"By . Kelly Strange . and Emma Innes . A man who was so fat he stopped breathing up to 80 times a night has shed 17 stone after doctors warned him he would die within two years. Kayes Uddin, 32, weighed 30 stone and was so obese he developed sleep apnoea, which caused his windpipe to close every time he dozed off. As a result, the father-of-three from Newham, London, had to wear a mask at night to keep his airway open while he slept. Kayes Uddin lost 17 stone after gastric bypass surgery. He dropped from 30 stone (left) to 13 stone (right). Before his weight loss, he had severe sleep apnoea and had been given just two years to live . The council project manager underwent gastric bypass surgery on the NHS and lost a massive 17 stone. He can now sleep without fearing he will never wake up. Now 13 stone, he said: ‘Being diagnosed with sleep apnoea was my lowest point. To be told my breathing was stopping at night because I was so fat was terrifying. ‘I was scared to sleep in case I never woke up. ‘Now I’m so fit I’ve cured the condition and don’t have to wear a mask in bed every night.’ Sleep apnoea is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep. It occurs when the muscles and tissue in the throat collapse causing a blockage of the airways. Due to his sleep apnoea, Mr Uddin had to wear breathing apparatus during the night to stop his airway closing up. He no longer needs it now he has lost so much weight . Mr Uddin (pictured before his weight loss surgery) had such bad sleep apnoea that he stopped breathing up to 80 times a night and he feared he would die in his sleep . It is associated with being overweight and some patients have to wear a mask at night to prevent their throat closing. Mr Uddin finally sought help from his GP in 2011 after a life long battle with his weight. Thanks . to a diet of curry, junk food and fizzy drinks, by the age of 15 he . weighed 15 stone and had to wear a customised school uniform. Mr Uddin has revolutionised his diet and his sleep apnoea has disappeared. He says he is now able to play with his children without becoming exhausted . He said: ‘I stood out a mile, but it was easier to hide the pain and carry on eating than try to diet. It seemed impossible.’ By the time he left school, he was more than 17 stone and continued to grow after getting married and starting a family. He explained: ‘With each baby that came along my wife and I both put on weight. We were eating a typical Asian diet with lots of fat as well as take outs, sweets and junk.’ Before: . Breakfast: Full fry upBreakfast two: Pastry, biscuits and coffeeSnack: Crisps, chocolate, fizzy drinkLunch: Kebab or chicken and chips, fizzy drinkSnack: ChocolateSnack: Coffee and more chocolateSnack after work: Cup of tea and biscuitsDinner: Chicken curry and rice - two platesSnack: Ice cream with flake and syrup . Now: . Breakfast: Water, Weetabix or porridgeSnack: Yoghurt or apple and bottle of waterLunch: Chicken or fish with salad or soupSnack: Yoghurt blended with fruitDinner: Either fish or chicken with vegetablesSnack: Bottle of water . By his mid-twenties Mr Uddin weighed 30 stone and had to wear specially ordered 7XL size clothing. He said: ‘I couldn’t walk without getting out of breath. Playing with the children left me exhausted and I knew I had to do something but didn’t know where to start.’ Then he started waking with pounding headaches and suffered unexplained tiredness. He said: ‘It didn’t make sense because I was going to bed at the same time but woke feeling like I’d stepped out of the boxing ring.’ Then his wife Lufta, 30, noticed he was waking with a start throughout the night. It got worse and he started leaping out of bed gasping for breath before falling asleep and doing the same again. Tests confirmed he was suffering with sleep apnoea. It had been triggered by his weight and was caused by fatty tissue at the back of the neck blocking his airway as he lay down to sleep. The only solution was to sleep with a mask on that regulated his breathing. He said: ‘It looked like a gas mask. I felt so old and useless before my time but it was keeping me alive.’ Mr Uddin’s GP eventually referred him . for gastric surgery on the NHS. The operation in July 2011 meant he . could only consume tiny portions. Mr Uddin said: 'Being diagnosed with sleep apnoea was my lowest point. To be told my breathing was stopping at night because I was so fat was terrifying. I was scared to sleep in case I never woke up' Mr Uddin said: 'I couldn't walk without getting out of breath. Playing with the children left me exhausted and I knew I had to do something but didn't know where to start' Within the first five months he lost nine stone, curing his sleep apnoea and meaning he could stop wearing the mask. He said: ‘It was a great feeling to go to bed without it. It’s fair to say it had been a passion killer.’ Earlier this year he reached his target weight of 13 stone – losing 20 inches from his waist, which went from 50 inches to 30 inches. Now he walks to work every day and runs three miles most evenings. His sons, Fahim, 11, Farhan, nine and daughter, Maisha, three, love having a new fit father to play with. Mr Uddin says that his weight loss has changed his whole family's lives as they have started eating more healthily and taking more exercise . Mr Uddin said: ‘The whole family has benefited. We have all adopted a totally healthy new approach to our eating and fitness. I can easily keep up with the children now and they love having the fit dad they deserve. ‘The operation was the starting point, but I’ve enjoyed success because I’ve been committed and worked with it to get the best results. ‘It’s not the quick fix people think it is, but if you commit to healthy eating and exercise, the results can be amazing.’ Sleep apnoea is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep. It occurs when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a blockage in the airway. When this happens, the person tends to wake up momentarily while their breathing returns to normal. When they slip back into a deep sleep they often stop breathing again. Many people with sleep apnoea snore and they often feel tired during the day as their sleep is interrupted. It is associated with being overweight. Other risk factors include having a large neck, taking sleeping pills, drinking alcohol and smoking. Sleep apnoea affects about four per cent of middle aged men and two per cent of middle aged women in the UK. It can affect people of any age but it most common in middle aged people. Some cases can be treated through lifestyle changes - such as losing weight - but people with more severe cases may require breathing apparatus to keep their airway open. If left untreated, sleep apnoea can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes and diabetes.

"By . Kelly Strange . Sick of being the 'frumpy' sibling, a woman has revealed how she shed five stone so she could become her attractive sister’s body double. Pamela Klimkowski, 54, from Greatbridge, West Midlands, used a photograph of her trim older sister, Eileen, showing off her size eight figure to keep her motivated. Born a year apart, the sisters were . often mistaken for twins as children. So Pamela was sure without the five stone weight difference between them, they could look identical again. I wanna be like you: LEFT: Pamela Klimkowski, right, lost five stone to look more like sister Eileen, left. RIGHT: Pamela's Eileen Nelson, right, was always slender . Comfort eating: After she lost her husband to cancer Pamela felt lost and alone and turned to food . She said: 'I used my sister as a real life example of what I would look like if I finally managed to lose the weight. It kept me more motivated because she was living proof of how I would look and could dress if I stuck to the plan. 'As soon as the weight started to come off people commented on how much more I looked like Eileen and that kept me going. Now we are mistaken for twins all the time.' Sharing a wardrobe: When the sisters holidayed in Spain last year they took a case of matching clothes to celebrate Pamela's weight loss . Growing up the women shared the same slim figures, but Pamela gained weight after marrying husband Stefan. 'It didn't bother me because he loved me as I was and we were so happy,' she explains. She lost him to kidney cancer when he was 52 after they had been married for 25 years. Without her childhood sweetheart, Pamela felt lost and alone and turned to food for comfort. With grown up daughter, Nicola, having left home, Pamela had nothing to rush home from her supermarket job for so ended up stopping for a take away after work most evenings. 'I used to love cooking, but it's not as much fun for one so I could never be bothered,' she explains. She also treated herself to bars of chocolate before bed and soon reached a size 18. Meanwhile Eileen had separated from her husband and thrown herself into the single scene. When she joined Ceroc dance classes, she urged her sister to get involved. But Pamela felt too fat and unattractive to join. She says: 'My confidence was at rock bottom. I stayed in on my own all the time because I was too terrified to try anything new. 'I was proud of Eileen for being so confident and brave and wished I could be more like her. I knew it was my weight holding me back.' Seeing double: Born a year apart, the sisters were often mistaken for twins as children. Pamela, left, was delighted when this happened again after she lost weight . Then a fall at work injured her shoulder and out of action for months, Pamela gained even more weight. 'I was stuck in front of the TV eating snacks all day. Before I knew it I was a size 24.' Pamela weighed 14 stone - almost double the weight of her eight stone sister. 'Once my shoulder recovered I couldn’t wait to get back to work but hated the thought of everyone seeing how fat I was. 'That's . when I decided I'd had enough of being the fat frumpy sister. I . wanted to be the slim, fun and sexy sister like Eileen.' Who's who? The sisters now love to dress the same to fool people . 'Having . my sister as my inspiration was more realistic than choosing a . celebrity because I knew if I could just stick to it I really would look . like her. She's always looked lovely and wore trendy clothes. If I lost . weight I knew I could too.' With her sister's support, Pamela followed a low fat diet and started exercising in her front room. After losing two stone she found the confidence to join her sister's dance class and compliments started flooded in. 'The people were lovely and all told me how much I looked like Eileen, I was thrilled because it meant my diet was working.' The dancing helped her to lose even more weight and within a year she had lost five stone. Inspired: Pamela, seen here after her 5st weight loss, used her sister as a real life example of what she could look like . 'Eileen was my biggest supporter. She was fantastic and urged me to keep going so we could swap clothes liked we used to as kids,' Pamela said. Pamela knew she had achieved her aim when one day the sisters were out shopping when a stranger asked if they were twins. 'Nobody had said that it over 40 years. I welled up. It was the best compliment ever and I was delighted.' With a new wardrobe to fit her new size eight body, Pamela and Eileen often accidentally ended up in similar outfits. 'One night at dancing we'd both worn white jeans and pink tops and someone asked if we were identical twins. It gave us an idea and we went shopping for some matching outfits as a laugh.' The women were in fits of giggles as they both tried on matching leopard print playsuits. Pamela said: 'We couldn't believe what we were wearing at our age but at dance class we were encouraged to wear over the top gear so we thought what the heck and bought them. 'The reaction we got was amazing. People were so kind and flattering.' The women started dressing as 'twins' more often. 'It might sound odd but it was good fun and gave us both such a laugh. We were so close we might as well have been twins,' Pamela explains. When they sisters holidayed in Spain last year they took a case of matching gear to celebrate Pamela's weight loss. 'We got a lot of attention dressing as twins, especially from younger men. It was such a confidence boost. 'I never thought I would be having such a good time at this age, but thanks to my sister I'm having double the fun.'","Pamela Klimkowski used sister Eileen as motivation to lose weight .

"By . Emma Innes . and Kelly Strange . A terminally ill three-year-old has been given the chance to visit Disneyland thanks to the generosity of MailOnline readers. Isabella Coomber, from London, was diagnosed with a brain tumour when she was one. Before Christmas her mother, Jolene Hale, 33, decided to stop her treatment to allow her to enjoy the time she has left. Isabella Coomber (left) was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour when she was one. Her last wish was to go to Disneyland and this was made possible by donations from generous readers . Ms Hale asked Isabella what she would like for Christmas and she replied that she would like to go back to Disneyland in America. Ms Hale was heartbroken as she knew she could not afford this trip. But desperate to make her little girl’s last wish come true, she appealed for donations. Generous donations flowed in and Ms Hale was able to take Isabella and her sisters to Disneyland earlier this month. She said: ‘Thanks to the amazing support we received after our story appeared we were able to make our daughter’s dream come true just in time. ‘She loved every minute of Disneyland and we made memories we will treasure forever.’ Isabella (pictured with her sister and mother, Jolene) had surgery and chemotherapy but these failed to cure the cancer. Her mother decided to stop treatment before Christmas so she could enjoy the time she has left . When MailOnline first ran a story about Isabella readers were so moved they donated enough money to pay for her and her sisters to go on holiday . Tragically, days after they flew home a scan at the Royal Marsden Hospital revealed Isabella’s brain tumour has grown. Doctors have now warned she has just 12 weeks to live. Ms Hale said: ‘It was not the news we wanted to hear, but we knew this awful day was coming. The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on the size of the tumour and where it is. As the tumour grows it will increase the pressure in the brain. This causes symptoms such as: . Tumours can also cause: .

Ms . Hale explained: ‘Ever since they told me Isabella would not make summer . I have yearned to see the sunshine on her beautiful face one more time. ‘But unfortunately it rained pretty much every day of our trip to Florida and has rained ever since here in England. ‘Isabella . loves toddling around with a bucket and spade so when we got this awful . news we decided to fly to the sun while she is in good strength so she . can feel the warmth on her back one more time. ‘It will be our last ever holiday as a family and the girls wanted to build sandcastles together. ‘When you are told the clock is ticking you can’t help but try to cram a lifetime into what few short days you have left.’ Jolene Hale said: 'Thanks to the amazing support we received after our story appeared we were able to make our daughter's dream come true just in time' Heartbreaking: When the family returned from Disneyland they were told Isabella's tumour has grown and she has now been given just 12 weeks to live. She is pictured with her mother, Jolene, and her sister, Rebecca . Isabella was very ill while being given chemotherapy so her doctors agreed it was better to stop treatment . The family will continue to fundraise to ensure Isabella’s last few weeks are as much fun as possible. They also hope to arrange a daytrip to Blackpool for Isabella to ride a donkey, and a school trip with her nursery class. Ms . Hale said: ‘She has always wanted to go on a school trip like her big . sister but we know that she will never get the chance. So if she can go . on a trip with her nursery class it’s another experience we have managed . to give her.’ Any . remaining funds will be spent on running the Little Lion’s Den, a . caravan providing free holidays to the families of young children with . cancer. Her mother said: 'The treatment will not cure Isabella so what is the point of continuing if it makes her quality of life so poor she can't enjoy herself?' Isabella's mother says her daughter . 'deserves some laughter and happiness' Isabella was . just one when she was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour after her . mother became concerned that she was not developing normally. She . underwent surgery and chemotherapy with no success so her parents began . fundraising to take her to America for radical new treatment. But doctors said there was no hope of a cure and arranged chemotherapy to try and prolong her life. Isabella's mother is now taking her to the Canary Islands to allow her to see the sun again before she dies . Isabella was diagnosed with a brain tumour after her mother noticed she was not developing normally . Ms Hale said: 'We wouldn't wish this on anyone. But the love and support from strangers who read our story has been humbling and for that we cannot say thank you enough' But having endured ten months of the 12 month course she was desperately sick and faced spending her last Christmas either in hospital or too weak to enjoy it. So doctors agreed with Ms Hale that treatment should be halted to allow her to enjoy quality time with her family, including sisters Rebecca, seven and Sophia, one, who accompanied her to Disneyland.

"By . Larisa Brown . 'Ridiculous': Gordon Wilkinson, a patient for 35 years, said it is near-impossible to get an appointment . A doctor's surgery is turning away patients whose illness is not deemed an emergency, saying the practice is overcrowded and ‘no longer safe’. In an astonishing letter sent out to its 10,000 patients, the GP practice claimed it was at ‘breaking point’, with doctors dealing with an ‘unsustainable’ workload. The letter outlined a new scheme, whereby patients will only be able to book an appointment on the same day if their condition is ‘medically urgent’. If it is not, they will have to wait up to seven days – in some cases even longer – just to be seen. Even then, they may only be given a telephone consultation. Halifax MP Linda Riordan said the changes at the town’s Keighley Road surgery were ‘terrifying’ and ‘seriously worrying’ to her constituents. Some feared they would have to attempt to self-diagnose themselves, elderly people said they could die before they managed to get an appointment and parents were worried about their children. The Royal College of General Practitioners said that GPs across the country have been trying various ways of coping with increased pressures. The Halifax letter painted an alarming picture. It said: ‘GP practices in England are at breaking point. ‘GPs currently deal with 90 per cent of all patient contacts in the NHS, however they only receive around 8 per cent of NHS funding. ‘The GPs at Keighley Road already work more than full-time hours and are dealing with an unsustainable number of patients each day. It is simply no longer safe for them or for you.’ There are four doctors based at the practice, including Dr Nicholas Davies, chairman to the Yorkshire Faculty of the Royal College of General Practitioners. It is understood the area has had no recent surge in population. Yesterday the surgery was shut in the afternoon for ‘staff training’. Gordon Wilkinson, a patient for 35 years, said: ‘My previous doctor here said it was getting ridiculous because they had so many patients and it was difficult to see everyone who needed to be treated.’ Mrs Riordan, a Labour MP, said: 'The NHS is under extreme pressure and doctors are at breaking point. I’ve had all ages coming to me about their concerns, including mothers worried for their children. Changes: This is the letter sent to patients of Keighley Road Surgery in Halifax, Yorkshire . 'If their child has a temperature, who do they go to? The already gridlocked A&E services? This is a real crisis, not only in Halifax, but nationwide.' Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said it was a nationwide issue. 'Funding has fallen, in real terms, but at the same time practices are trying to deal with more patients with more complicated needs,' he added. David Geddes of NHS England said: 'Changes to the GP contract have been introduced to improve access to services and give patients more choice in how they contact their practice.

"By . Larisa Brown . Two police firearms officers are being investigated over claims they killed an injured deer with a crowbar. The officers had been sent to humanely destroy the animal after it was hit by a vehicle. But instead of using the weapons they were carrying – as expected in the situation – they instead decided to use a crowbar to bludgeon the stricken deer to death. Taken out of its misery: A deer like the one beaten to death by two Durham police officers . Durham Police said the officers had been trained to humanely kill large animals as part of their duties and had no explanation as to why they chose the unorthodox method. The force confirmed it was investigating the incident, adding that the deer was ‘apparently not destroyed in a humane manner’. Animal rights charities said the officers should be ‘locked up’ if an investigation found they did beat the deer to death unnecessarily. A member of the pubic called police after the deer was found knocked over in Tanfield Lea, County Durham, in June. Police would usually ask a vet to deal with the animal, but as one could not reach the scene quickly enough, an armed response unit was sent instead. But rather than following procedure and using their firearms to end the deer’s suffering as quickly as possible, they used a crowbar. The approved method of humane destruction, according to the police, is to authorise the crew in an armed response vehicle to use their weapons to shoot the injured animal so that the death is as clean and quick as possible. Amply equipped for the job: Durham Police said the officers had been trained to humanely kill large animals as part of their duties and had no explanation as to why they chose the unorthodox method . Officers have to be given authority to use their weapons by a duty inspector. The incident only came to light after other officers, who were not present at the time, were made aware of what had happened. It was reported to senior officers earlier this month and the pair involved have been moved to other duties while an investigation is carried out. They could face a misconduct hearing or criminal charges. Yesterday a spokesman for animal rights group Peta said: ‘If it turns out that police officers did, in fact, bludgeon a deer to death, they should be not only struck off, but also locked up.’ A spokesman for Durham Police said: ‘It is not unusual for firearms officers to be deployed on occasions when a deer, or other large animal, is clearly suffering as the result of being struck by a vehicle and the best action would be for the animal to be humanely destroyed. ‘We can confirm inquiries are being made to establish the circumstances surrounding the destruction of an injured deer on a road in Tanfield Lea in early June. ‘It has been brought to our attention that the deer was apparently not destroyed in the approved, humane manner.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘This sounds like a terrible incident and we await the conclusion of the police investigation.’","Police were sent to dispatch the deer after it was hit by a car in Tanfield Lea .

"By . Larisa Brown . A woman walking her three dogs on a public footpath had two of them ‘dognapped’ by the owners of a riding school after she refused to put them all on leads. Emma Heslop was walking her pets in the countryside when she was approached by Mark Firby who was concerned about his horses in the field crossed by the path. Miss Heslop’s Hungarian wirehaired vizsla Drummer was on a lead while another vizsla, Oscar, and her English springer spaniel Isla were walking to heel. Scroll down for video . Emma Heslop, 35, was walking her dogs (from left; Isla, Oscar and Drummer) near Richmond, North Yorkshire when she claims she was approached by Mark Firby who was concerned about his horses in the field . The 35-year-old nurse said Mr Firby – who owned the land surrounding the public right of way – demanded that she put Oscar and Isla on leads and threatened to shoot them when she refused. His wife Michelle then arrived in a Land Rover and, according to Miss Heslop, got into a struggle with her over Drummer. Mr Firby, meanwhile, bundled Isla into the couple’s 4x4. Miss Heslop, worried about the springer spaniel, said she let go of Drummer to walk over to the vehicle to check on Isla – at which point Mrs Firby walked off out of sight with the vizsla. The couple had also tried to catch Oscar but were unable to reach him. By now Mr Firby had gone to call the police and Miss Heslop was able to free Isla from the Land Rover. The Firbys returned Drummer to her after the police arrived and Miss Heslop put all three dogs on leads. Yesterday she said she had been ‘petrified’ by the altercation near Richmond, North Yorkshire. The Firbys own the nearby Hollies Riding School. Miss Heslop, from Darlington, said: ‘It was as though they were taking previous anger with dog walkers out on me for no reason whatsoever.’ Miss Heslop claims that Mr Firby threatened to shoot her three dogs when she refused to put them on a lead while walking along the footpath (pictured). Police confirmed that an officer attended the incident . Mark and Michelle Firby own Hollies Riding School in Richmond, North Yorkshire, which advertises riding lessons on its website (above). They were said to be concerned for the welfare of their horses in a nearby field . She said the dogs had not been worrying any horses and the ‘dognapping’ had been aggressive and unnecessary. ‘There had been horses in the field further up but my dogs were under complete control and we had already passed the horses,’ Miss Heslop said. ‘I prefer to have the dogs off their lead so they can easily escape if the horses attempt to trample on them and injure me in the process. The Countryside Code says dog owners must keep their pet under effective control. Dogs should be on a lead or in sight and the owner must be confident it will return promptly on command. The code also advises that it is good practice to keep pets on a lead near livestock and horses. Legally, dogs are regarded as a ‘usual accompaniment’ to anyone using a public right of way. But dogs and their owners are meant to stay on the line of the route. It is an offence for a dog to be at large in a field in which there are sheep. As with any property, stealing a dog is illegal. But a livestock owner or the landowner can shoot a dog if they believe it is the only reasonable way of stopping it worrying livestock. ‘It was just a bizarre experience and the law states as long as the dogs are under control I had done nothing wrong. ‘When the police turned up they defused the situation. I just feel quite confused about the whole incident and why it got to that point. ‘I was getting verbally abused throughout and it was a very unpleasant situation. ‘After the threat from Mr Firby I was worried that my dogs were going to get shot.’ She added: ‘I am quite annoyed by it all. In my 15 years experience of walking dogs I have never come across people like this. To think that someone would physically try to take the leads out of my hand is crazy. ‘I’m just relieved I got my dogs back safe and sound in the end.’ When asked about the incident, Mrs Firby said: ‘I don’t want to get into the tittle tattle of it all really. The dogs were well away from the owner and we saw it in our right to act the way we did. ‘We are not fazed by what has been said about this.’ A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police confirmed that an officer had attended the incident on June 28, but neither party made a complaint.","Emma Heslop was walking her three dogs near Richmond, North Yorkshire .

"By . Larisa Brown . and Harriet Arkell . 'He's got his life back but mine is ruined': Demi Bowers was aged just 13 when she was abused . When a neighbour who sexually abused her was jailed, Demi Bowers hoped she had seen the last of him. So she was devastated when she looked out of her house and saw John Breckon staring at her from across the road. She was even more horrified to discover that he had moved back into the street after completing his prison sentence. Now the teenager has been forced to leave her family home and move miles away to escape Breckon, who groomed and abused her when she was 13. ‘I was home alone and I saw him across the street staring at me from the window laughing,’ said Mrs Bowers, now 18, who has waived her right to anonymity and is calling for a change in the law to ban paedophiles from living near their victims. ‘I rang my mum crying and she said I was seeing things. But then she came back and saw for herself. He’s got his life back whereas I have had to move house and I am the victim.’ Breckon, 52, showered her with gifts before sexually assaulting her over a five-month period while his wife worked night shifts. The attacks happened after Mrs Bowers began babysitting after school for the former factory worker, then a family friend, in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. She viewed him as a father-figure but he became infatuated with her. She was home alone on one side of the street when she realised her abuser had moved in over the road . She eventually told her teachers and in 2010 Breckon was jailed at Hull Crown Court after he admitted sexual activity with a child. He was released in 2012 after serving half his two-and-a-half-year sentence but initially was banned from Bridlington. However, the restriction ended in February last year. Mrs Bowers, who has moved away with . her partner Natalia Bowers, 25, said: ‘When the ban ended, I saw him at . the house his mother left him in her will across the road. ‘When he was jailed I became obsessed . with thinking he was there. I was constantly locking doors. I suffer . from depression and anxiety because of what happened to me. Forced to move: She says she now suffers severe anxiety and depression and is too afraid to leave the house . 'There’s nothing stopping him now and I still keep thinking he is there. He has his house and his wife and has his life back but I am suffering because I have to live far away from my family.’ 'He's got his life back whereas I have had to move house and I am the victim' Demi Bowers . It is understood that Breckon spends . part of his time at the house, which he is renovating, and the rest of . the time at his family home nearby with his wife Karen, 49, a nurse, and . their five-year-old daughter. Mrs Bowers said: ‘He was infatuated . with me when I was 13. He placed a mirror in the bedroom angled so he . could see directly across into my room.’ Her mother Angela Kingston, 39, a . voluntary worker, said: ‘We are living in the 21st century and a . convicted paedophile is allowed to live opposite his victim and nothing . is stopping him. New life: Mrs Bowers married her partner Natalia (left), 25, earlier this year and is hoping to go to college . ‘My daughter was robbed of her . childhood, she can’t come and visit her own mum. He was sat in the . window watching her from her bedroom and now she is too scared to be . here.’ 'He was sat in the window watching her from her bedroom and now she is too scared to be here' Angela Kingston, mother . She said Breckon was taunting them. ‘There is no law stopping it and I feel let down. He has more human . rights than she does. She has had to move away.’ Adam Pemberton of Victim Support said: . ‘Too many times, too many victims of violent or sexual assaults tell us . they do not feel safe when the person convicted of a crime against them . is released.

"By . Larisa Brown . Meet Bertie the turbo tortoise, who can cover 18ft in a world record 19.59 seconds. The young Leopard tortoise stunned spectators as he crossed the finish line in less than half the time as the previous record. In fact before Bertie came along, the last tortoise to reach anywhere near was back in 1977 when Charlie set the record of 43.7 seconds. Bertie the tortoise has broken the world record for an 18ft 'sprint', clocking a time of just 19.59 seconds - less than half the time of the previous world best - and even pulled a Usain Bolt pose afterwards . Bertie is a Leopard tortoise, thought to be nine years old, from Adventure Valley theme park in Durham . The tortoise, who lives at the . Adventure Valley theme park in Durham, was placed on a specially-built . 18ft-long uphill course in front of crowds of visitors. Despite . fears he might get cold feet on the big day, Bertie, thought to be . around nine-years-old, did not disappoint those who turned up to watch . him rocket up the wooden track - even finishing with a victory wave as . he crossed the chequered line. Marco . Calzini, owner of Adventure Valley, said: ‘Bertie loves going outside . for a walk, as soon as we put him down he’s off and running. ‘Visitors are always remarking how fast he is. He’s like the Usain Bolt of the tortoise world. ‘Not . only has he smashed the world record, he’s obliterated it completely. I . think it will stand for a long time now, without a shadow of a doubt.’ On his first attempt he managed a time of 21.47 seconds, well under . Charlie’s effort at the National Tortoise Championships 37 years . previously. And then - just to show off - he went on to shave a further two seconds off his time. Adventure Valley owner Marco Calzini (pictured) said the park thought to put Bertie to the test after visitors kept on remarking on how fast he ran . The previous world record of 43.7 seconds was set in 1977 by Charlie and remained unbroken fro 37 years . His keepers and officials from the Guinness Book of Records were there to keep a check on the race. Bertie . was given to the adventure park and animal farm three years ago when . its owners went to live abroad. The park is always popular with visitors . and it was they who first spotted his love of speed. David . Leon, of Partners Leisure, said: ‘He’d be put out for exercise and . visitors would say “he can move; we didn’t realise tortoises could be . that fast”. That started it.’ They checked the record books and, after a . training programme that saw Bertie set a personal best of 20 seconds, . decided to put him to the official test which meant strict regulations, . adjudicators in place and stop-watches at the ready. The . course was made to the exact specifications of the original and . included a slight gradient but Bertie, putting fellow animal residents . to shame, sprinted off at a cracking pace. Bertie has some way to go to beat the real Usain, however, who holds the world record for the sprint with a time of 9.58 seconds . He did two runs, first . setting a time of 21 seconds then, confidence building, came his . personal best. At a third . attempt he began to flag but by then he had earned his finishing-line . treat which was a cut-up strawberry, a change from his regular grassy . diet. The farm is now . awaiting an official certificate which will be displayed on a pen shared . by Bertie and his female friend tortoise Shelly. Mr Calzini said: ‘I’m so proud of him, so pleased. Now hopefully we will get that official recognition.’","Bertie is a Leopard tortoise thought to be nine years old .

"By . Larisa Brown . and Chris Brooke . Catastrophic: Summer with her mother Victoria Rogers . The mother of a toddler left dying in her cot was to blame for the child’s death, a judge has ruled. A previously unseen document stated that on the balance of probabilities Victoria Rogers lost her self-control and caused catastrophic injuries to her child. Despite the damning judgment the Crown Prosecution Service has refused to press charges because of ‘insufficient evidence’ to prove who was to blame. Last week a coroner said that Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, aged 21 months, was found with catastrophic head injuries and ruled that she was unlawfully killed by either her mother or stepfather. Prior to the inquest a judgment had been made by a family court judge concerning who was culpable for the death. The judgment at Teesside County Court – which attributed blame to Miss Rogers – was seen for the first time yesterday after this newspaper helped overturn a ruling which prohibited its publication. Summer’s grandfather James Ratcliffe told the Daily Mail that with the judgment in the public domain he would go on with his 25-year-old son Joss – Summer’s father – to fight for justice. Mr Ratcliffe, 44, along with 2,400 people who have signed a petition, urged the CPS to reconsider the decision not to prosecute anyone. He said: ‘I am flabbergasted to think that in 2014 an inquest found Summer was killed but no one has yet been made accountable. She didn’t just die. She was hit and no one has been prosecuted. It is outrageous. ‘It is fantastic news that the family court ruling is now in the public domain. It will open up a lot of areas to be pursued and hopefully we can go on to get justice. We want to move forward to get someone accountable for Summer’s murder.’ Toddler Summer Ratcliffe from Dewsbury with her father Joss Ratcliffe . Summer, whose parents split up when she was three months old, was taken to hospital after being found unconscious in her cot at around 8.30am on Monday February 27, 2012. She had a severely swollen brain, which was bruised and bleeding, and died hours later. A post-mortem examination revealed she had suffered a ‘blunt force trauma’ to her head. Ancillary nurse Miss Rogers, 27, Summer’s stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, were arrested seven months later as they were the only people in the house in the time frame of the murder. The toddler, pictured with her mother, had a severely swollen brain, which was bruised and bleeding . All three insisted they had not touched the girl and did not know how she suffered the injuries.In the judgment published yesterday, it was said Summer had a tantrum after returning from her grandmother’s house on the day before she was found dying. In evidence, Miss Rogers said she had told her daughter: ‘I’m sick of you coming home like this.’ Mr Sharp claimed she told her daughter something to the effect of ‘I can’t stand you any more’. The judgment read: ‘I... have no doubt that the mother was acutely distressed by Summer’s tantrum. I am satisfied that the mother is an emotionally fragile person who would have been deeply upset by the episode which followed Summer’s return home on the Sunday. ‘The evidence does not, in my judgment, support the conclusion that anything was likely to have happened which would have caused Craig S (stepfather) to lose his self-control in the two hours or so between the mother leaving home and Mrs R arriving. ‘The evidence does support, in my judgment, the conclusion that something happened during the course of that night which caused the mother to lose her self-control. ‘However hard the decision, having regard to the cumulative effect of all the evidence and, in particular, the matters referred to above, I have come to the clear conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence establishes that the injuries sustained by Summer were caused by her mother.’ Miss Rogers told police she and Mr Sharp went to bed at around 9pm on the Sunday at their home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. She said she kissed her daughter, who seemed fine, before leaving for work at 6am. Mr Sharp said he woke at 6.30am and checked on Summer by standing at her bedroom door before leaving for work as soon as Mrs Rogers walked in. At the Bradford inquest, coroner Oliver Longstaff effectively cleared Mrs Rogers of blame but did not single out either the mother or stepfather as the likely killer. Mr Sharp and the CPS declined to comment yesterday. Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe and her mother's boyfriend Craig Sharp .

"By . Larisa Brown . With a new season just weeks away, the country’s brief respite from Premier League football is almost over. But despite the wall-to-wall media coverage and the millions of pounds paid to its stars, England’s top football league comes a distant second to the theatre when it comes to paying customers. A study has found that more people attend plays and musicals at London’s theatres each year than Premier League games across the country. Shows including A Midsummer Night’s Dream (above starring Sheridan Smith), the Lion King and the Mousetrap pulled in an astonishing 22million spectators in just one year . Shows including A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the Lion King and the Mousetrap pulled in an astonishing 22million spectators in just one year. By comparison, just under 14million football fans attended the 380 Premier League matches last season. The study, commissioned by the National Theatre and the Society of London Theatre, asked every licensed theatre in London to provide attendance and box office figures. During 2011/12, 21million people attended theatres in London, bringing in an estimated £609million. This increased by 5.2 per cent to 22million (£619million) in 2012/13. But football figures showed just 13,944,100 fans attended all Premier League matches last season. The domestic football season only runs from August to May, whereas long-running shows at the theatre can be shown twice a day and up to seven days a week. Ben Foster (left) and Gillian Anderson appear in A Streetcar Named Desire at The Young Vic . The 2012/13 analysis showed there were 241 professional theatres in London, with more than 110,000 seats between them. Alistair Smith, the editor of trade paper The Stage, who undertook the study, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is an interesting comparison, which shows that more people like going to see live theatre than going to watch the football. London theatre also takes more at the box office than London’s cinemas.’ Nick Starr, the National’s executive director, said: ‘While there has been for some time an awareness that London is a world city for theatre, we’ve hitherto lacked the data to see just how big it is. ‘These are valuable insights not only for the capital, but also nationally and internationally — and valuable, too, I hope, for policy-makers.’ Venues surveyed ranged from the 30-seat Lord Stanley pub in Camden to the 3,600-seat Hammersmith Apollo. The report identified 59 commercial theatres, 47 fringe venues and 135 not-for-profit theatres such as the Globe and the National. London theatreland is more popular than Premier League games even those featuring top teams like Arsenal and Manchester United . Two London boroughs – Ealing and Bexley – had no permanent professional theatre. Westminster accounted for a third of London’s theatre capacity. The commercial West End accounted for just over half of capacity and the majority of box office. Arts Council-backed theatres accounted for a third of all tickets sold. At £21.24, average prices for Arts-Council-backed theatres were cheaper than the West End, where the average figure was £36.05. Fringe tickets – bought by 586,000 people – were around £10. In 2012 a total of 43million people went to the cinema. Given the average cinema ticket is £6.37, far more money is spent at the theatre. London’s theatres employ more than 3,000 performers at any one time, another 6,500 full-time non-performing staff and thousands of others.","Shows including A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the Lion King and The Mousetrap attracted 22million spectators in one year .

"By . Larisa Brown . An elderly cancer victim has died after a police dog savaged her in her  own home. Irene Collins, 73, had answered her door to officers searching the neighbourhood for an escaped suspected drug dealer. Just as she showed officers into the back garden of her home, the dog pounced, leaving her screaming in terror and covered in blood. Penrith Road in Middlesbrough where Irene Collins lived when she was attacked by the police dog . Mrs Collins, who was suffering from lung cancer, was taken to hospital but died over the weekend. Neighbours claimed to have warned officers beforehand that she was in a frail condition. One . said: ‘She wasn’t bitten, she was mauled. A relative told me the dog . had punctured and broken her arm, ripped her other arm, and then managed . to bite off her calf muscle after it had been restrained.’ Another . neighbour said: ‘It was horrible, everyone could hear her screaming . right across the street. It was a shock to see her. She had blood across . her face, and she was grey with shock. ‘The police dog handler had searched my house earlier and he was in tears. He looked devastated by what happened.’ Cleveland . Police said Mrs Collins had suffered ‘bites about her body’. Officers . said the dog had been ‘withdrawn from operational policing activities’, . but it was not clear whether it had been destroyed. The tragedy, which happened in Middlesbrough last Wednesday night, was said to have left the whole street in shock. Mrs . Collins, a widow for 30 years, had opened the door to officers chasing a . suspected drugs dealer who had fled through gardens after being stopped . in a car nearby. A resident said: ‘The street was full of police. There was a helicopter searching from above and about seven police cars. Assistant chief constable Sean White of Cleveland Police offered his condolences to the family . ‘A . car had apparently been stopped and the driver ran off into our estate. The police were knocking on doors and asking to search people’s back . gardens and outbuildings. Someone told them Irene was ill but they went . to her door anyway.’ Mrs . Collins was said to have answered the door at the side of her house and . was about to  show the officers into her back garden when the dog, . described as a cross between a springer spaniel and an alsatian, . attacked her. After being treated at the scene she was taken to James . Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, where she died. Speaking . soon after the drama, neighbour Claire Williams said: ‘Irene was lying . on the kitchen floor while the police attended to her. ‘She was in ill health already. She barely leaves the house, her breathing is very poor and she’s about six stone. 'I . warned the police to be careful and told them she may not make it to . the door but they went anyway. It’s horrific what happened to her.’ Mrs Collins’ family issued a brief statement thanking people for their ‘kind messages’. A family spokesman added: 'We are devastated.' Jose Pearson, 85, a neighbour for almost 60 years, described Mrs Collins as a lovely woman. ‘All the work she did was for charity,’ she said. ‘For years it was all she did, working in a charity shop.’ The incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Neighbour Kerry Blades laid flowers at Ms Collins’ Penrith Road home with niece Tylier Smith, nine. She said: 'It is disgusting. For her to be in her own home when it happened, it has shocked everyone down the road. The dog shouldn’t have been let off a lead until it was absolutely necessary. 'She has lived here for years. I have been here for 34 years, and I think she has been here since I was little. 'She was very quiet, but always very nice with people. She liked spending time with her family and her son was always there. We used to see her pottering around in her garden as well. 'Nobody can believe what happened.' Jack Williams, 20, a student at Teesside University who lives next door to Ms Collins, said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news. He said: 'We all can’t believe it.

"By . Larisa Brown . In court: Anne Lakey is accused of a string of sex offences against a teenage boy in the 1980s . An acclaimed head teacher had sex with an underage boy in his uniform as he played truant from school, a court heard yesterday. Anne Lakey, 54, who transformed her school into one of the best in the country,  phoned the boy’s school and – referring to herself as his ‘mummy’ – said he was too ill to go, it was alleged. Lakey, referred to as a ‘predator’ and ‘disgusting sexual monster’, is accused of grooming the boy from the age of 13 or 14 for a year-long period in the late 1980s. The court was told she had sex with the impressionable teenager at her family home. When her husband returned unexpectedly, she made the boy hide in a cupboard. Lakey appeared at Durham Crown Court yesterday accused of a string of ‘predatory’ sexual offences, including sex with a boy under 16. She is accused of having sex with him while he was in  his school uniform and exposing herself to him. The offences were said to have occurred when she was a teacher in her late 20s, but the alleged victim was not a pupil. She denies the claims, dismissing them as ‘just a fantasy’. She met her alleged victim, the court heard, when he was just 13 or 14 and began to exploit him, eventually seducing him while he played truant from school at her home. Caroline Goodwin, prosecuting, said: ‘At this house, groups of boys would gather – her husband at the time was sometimes there. Sooner or later he, the complainant, began to go by himself. It was then that the relationship took on a more sinister overtone. ‘He was a teenager who was naturally curious about sex, she flattered him and paid attention to him. He was a young teenager who was being groomed by a woman who was a sexual predator.’ The court heard how Lakey asked the complainant if he would play a game of ‘dare’ with her, which resulted in her baring her breasts and allowing him to touch them. Later she allowed the boy to sit on a step outside the bath as she washed and then stood up and walked into the bedroom, dropped her towel and asked him ‘what are you going to do then?’ Scroll down for video . Head teacher Lakey, 54, who arrived hand in hand with an unknown man,  is accused of grooming the boy from the age of 13 or 14 after which she allegedly had sex with the impressionable teenager at her family home . Then, the court heard, she had sex with the boy, still dressed in his school uniform, and continued to have a sexual relationship with him regularly after that. The court heard that Lakey told the boy she loved him and he would say it back. Miss Goodwin said the opportunities to have sex were ‘plentiful’ and Lakey would sometimes call the boy’s school, refer to herself as the boy’s ‘mummy’ and say that he was not coming in because of illness. The complainant came forward in 2012 after seeing a piece of literature which said that Lakey was committed to giving young people the best chance in life. In a letter, he called the defendant a ‘disgusting sexual monster’. Lakey, from Stanley, County  Durham, was described as an ‘inspiring leader’ by the Chief Inspector of Education after improving GCSE pass rates at her struggling school by focusing on vocational education. The federation where Lakey was chief executive also ran Durham Community Business College, pictured . But she was suspended from her . position as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools last . December after the allegations came to light. She . denies  all nine charges against her, which include two counts of . inciting  a boy to commit an act of  gross indecency, two of gross . indecency, and five counts of  indecent assault. The offences are said to have happened between April 1988 and May 1989. Lakey . became the head teacher at Deerness Valley Comprehensive in 2001 which . later became one of two schools to form the Durham Federation of . Schools. Under Lakey’s . leadership the school boasted GCSE pass rates of 80 per cent in 2013 . against 26 per cent the year before, and it was named the country’s most . improved secondary school last year. Lakey, . who was appointed to the national leaders of education, a body charged . with transforming struggling schools, entered teaching in 1982. The . trial continues.

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Larisa Brown . When two prisoners decided to stage a rooftop protest on a hot day, it was only a matter of time before health and safety became an issue. Sure enough, staff at Dartmoor prison in Devon soon became concerned about the men’s welfare... and offered them suncream. The Ministry of Justice said the offer was part of its duty of care, but Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright condemned it as ‘promoting foolishness’, and John Hancock, of the Prison Officers’ Association, said it was ‘absolutely ludicrous’. Outrage: Staff at HMP Dartmoor in Devon have been blasted for offering prisoners sun cream after they climbed on to a roof during last week's heatwave. The Ministry of Justice defended the move as 'a duty of care' The incident was eventually resolved by negotiation between the convicts and the wardens at the prison which as built to hold French and American prisoners of war in 1809. It now houses 659 inmates . Mr Hancock said: ‘They shouldn’t have been up there in the first place. 'In . next two or three weeks, when we hit the hotter part of the summer, it . is only going to encourage other inmates to get up there on the roofs . and expect suncream and sun block – and possibly cold drinks and ice . creams. ‘It is absolutely ludicrous that inmates are being molly-coddled. I have been in the service 28 years and in my day we would have gone on the roof and used hose pipes to squirt the prisoners with water. ‘It is absolute madness. They would have soon come down when the sun went in and it started getting cold.’ The pair sneaked up to the sun spot at . HMP Dartmoor in Devon for eight hours during last week's heatwave when . temperatures topped 24C in some places. The two men declined the suncream. Peter McParlin, the National Chairman . of the Prison Officers' Association said: 'I imagine the officers gave . the sun cream on instruction from managers.' He added: 'There's been a spike in incidents at height - part of that is the reduction in staff. 'The supervision isn't there to the extent it has in the past.' Safety first: The Ministry of Justice has now launched a review into the suncream incident on June 19 . Defending the situation, the Ministry . of Justice (MoJ) said the offer of sun lotion was a means of negotiation . to get the prisoners to come down from what appeared to be a protest. An inquiry has now been launched into the incident. It is not clear how the inmates managed to get on to the roof or which building on the site in Princetown was involved - but sources described it as an incident 'at height'. Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'This should not have happened. 'There should be no policies in place . which promote this kind of foolishness and I have ordered an immediate . review of this incident to ensure that it does not happen again.' The incident was mocked on social media. Commenting on Facebook Stephanie Harrison said: 'Sheer stupidity. 'They decided to get up there so they must face the consequences...and if it means sun burn then so be it! Why pander to them as next they will be wanting iced drinks and a sun shade!!' Ashley Holman said: 'Not sure if Dartmoor prison offer deck chairs to their residents. Next they will be offering hats shorts and sandals.' Dartmoor prison, which is currently . able to hold 659 inmates, was originally built to hold French and . American prisoners of war in 1809. Owned . by the Duchy of Cornwall, it is a Category C prison - for convicts who . are not trusted in open spaces but are deemed unlikely to escape. Notable . former convicts include the 'acid bath murderer' John Haigh and Frank . Mitchell, the 'Mad Axeman' employed by the Kray twins. An MoJ spokeswoman said: 'On Thursday 19 June, there was an incident at height at HMP Dartmoor involving two prisoners. 'The incident was successfully resolved by negotiation at 4.28pm. No staff or prisoners were injured.'","Pair climbed out during heatwave in HMP Dartmoor, Devon, on June 19 .

"By . Larisa Brown . A schoolgirl who was left heartbroken when she was dumped by her boyfriend killed herself in the same spot where they went on their first date, an inquest heard. Doctor’s daughter Helena Farrell, 15, was found hanged in a wood near her home with a Coldplay song playing repeatedly in the background. The inquest at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard she was a ‘bright, intelligent, adventurous and fun- loving’ girl who was a gifted cellist and singer. Helena Farrell, pictured, was found dead in woodlands in Cumbria in January 2013, the inquest heard . But the teenager had been forced to move schools after being bullied for having red hair and a ‘posh accent’. Speaking yesterday, her father Enda Farrell, 56, said: ‘She was unhappy because people were teasing her about the colour of her hair and about her accent.’ She transferred to an independent school, and at the age of 14 went on an exchange trip to Europe – where she claimed she was sexually assaulted in an attack which triggered an 18-month bout of bulimia. After she left the private school she moved to her local comprehensive, Kirkbie Kendal School. The inquest heard that in autumn 2012 she started dating Billy Williams, a boy who was one year above her. The teenager had been forced to move schools after being bullied for having red hair and a 'posh accent' At the age of 14, she went on an exchange trip to Europe where she claimed she was sexually assaulted - triggering an 18-month spell of bulimia, an inquest heard . On their first date the pair went for a walk in the woods near her home in Kendal. However Mr Williams ended the relationship shortly after the half-term holidays in October. After the break-up, she wrote on Facebook that he had ‘broken her heart’ and went on to take an overdose of paracetamol. Her . father, a former councillor, and her mother Maria, a GP, told the . inquest they had desperately tried to help their daughter overcome her . ‘dark thoughts’. Mr . Williams urged his ex-girlfriend to seek help from the school . counsellor, accompanying her to appointments to offer his support. Her father Enda Farrell (left holding a picture of Helena) said she was not happy because people were 'teasing her about the colour of her hair' But he . went on to accept her  invitation to a party, where he kissed another . girl – prompting Helena to try and cut herself in the stomach with a . knife. Giving  evidence at the hearing, her former boyfriend, who is now . 18, said: ‘She broke down. She was on the kitchen floor. I said to her, . “why are you doing this?”. ‘She had tried to cut her stomach. It made me realise what I hadn’t noticed, that she still liked me.’ On the day of her death, in January last year, Mr Williams said she had sent him several texts. ‘She was where we first met,’ Mr Williams said, adding: ‘She said goodbye and I said please stop this. ‘She . said I love you, which she had not said for a long time, and hung up. Then she texted me saying thank you for everything.’ Mr Williams said he . ‘didn’t think she’d actually do anything’, but decided to alert his . parents. Helena had been in a brief relationship with William Williams while they were both studying at Kirkbie Kendal School, pictured, in Cumbria . They got in touch with Helena’s parents, who in turn contacted the . police. Mr Williams went out to search for her in the woodland half a . mile away from her home. He was joined by a policeman, who found Helena’s body hanging from a tree close to the grounds of the town’s Castle Green Hotel. Giving . evidence, PC Paul Kelly said he arrived at the scene to find the . Coldplay song The Scientist playing on repeat, and a bundle of clothing . along with 14 pieces of paper spelling out a statement. He said: ‘I . wasn’t expecting to see what I found. It was surreal. There was a very . strange layout of articles and music was playing on loop.’ The . inquest heard that Helena had written letters saying goodbye to her . family and friends in the weeks leading up to her death, but they were . confiscated by a teacher. Mrs Farrell yesterday paid tribute to her . daughter, saying: ‘She was lovely, she was not a problem child. She had . courage and I admired her.’ The inquest continues.

"By . Larisa Brown . A Ferrari-driving bully who plundered his wealthy lover’s estate after she disappeared has been found guilty of her murder. Donald Graham killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, so he could fund his lavish taste in supercars and buy his second mistress a home. Miss Brown vanished in 2005 and her body has never been found. He stole £300,000 of her savings, sold her Land Rover and Porsche with a personalised number plate, took her horses and tried to siphon off thousands of pounds from her estate and that of her family. Donald Graham, 59, has been found guilty of killing his lover Janet Brown, 45, and hiding her body before trying to strip her and her elderly parents of all their assets . Ms Brown (left), a wealthy heiress, went missing before she was due to go on holiday in 2005. Graham (right) killed her, hid her body, then sent fake postcards from France pretending to be her and saying she had a job . He also spun a cruel web of lies that left Miss Brown’s parents believing she was still alive. After . a seven-week trial at  Newcastle Crown Court, Graham was found guilty . of her murder and perverting the course of  justice yesterday. After the verdict, police called on Graham, nicknamed ‘Dodgy Don’, to tell Miss Brown’s family what he had done with her body. Detective . Chief Inspector Nicola Musgrove, of Northumbria Police, said: ‘Graham . is a controlling and manipulative man, particularly towards women; a . bully who deliberately instils fear into people and uses intimidating . behaviour to get his own way. ‘He is a callous man who made it look like Janet was alive when in fact he had, motivated by financial greed, murdered her.’ Graham, 60, described as ‘flash’ and always ‘dripping in gold’, had lived with his wife Denise, 66, but had two mistresses. Donald gained the trust of Ms Brown's elderly and ill parents, stole their bank details, and after their deaths he plundered their estate using it to pay for fast cars (pictured, Graham's Ferrari) Graham was on trial with another lover, Elizabeth Todd (right), accused of making a fake will signing Ms Brown's family farm over to him. The jury were unable to reach a verdict on Todd, 51 (right) Last night an acquantaince of Graham, Elliot Stuart, 68, said: ‘People were frightened of him just because of his reputation. ‘When . we would go out he would park his car on double  yellow lines outside . restaurants, like he was in the gangster  movies. Nobody would ever stop . him or ask him to move. ‘His stepson told me he is a nasty man and made his life and his mother’s life a misery.’ 'Graham is a controlling and manipulative man, particularly towards women; a bully who deliberately instils fear... to get his own way' - Northumbria Police . Another . friend, and former partner of Miss Brown, known as Mick, said: ‘Janet . met Don through me. I serviced his cars, he had a Ferrari, a Porsche, . four-wheel drives, a Subaru Impreza. ‘He was polite, plausible, . well-educated but if he came and asked you for money you would give it . to him because he looked like he would pull your head off.’ Prosecutor Robert Smith, QC, told jurors that Graham’s lifestyle ‘didn’t match his income and his assets’. Graham . and Miss Brown, from Hexham, Northumberland, who had saved ‘substantial . assets’ of over £400,000, had been together for eight years. He told . her that his wife had cancer and when she died they would marry. The . pair arranged to go on holiday to France in 2005 but at the last minute . he pulled out, claiming his wife was unwell, so Miss Brown decided to go . alone. Despite repeated searches by police (pictured) Ms Brown's body has never been found. The court heard that Graham was her lover for eight years despite already being married . Nicola Musgrove, from Northumbria Police, said Graham should now admit what he has done with Ms Brown's body so that her family can be allowed to grieve . It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that . she was murdered. Her parents Olive and Eric Brown, a former accountant . who had ‘substantial’ savings, were led to believe she was living in . Europe after Graham sent a series of fake postcards and letters. They . died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was . working in a bank in Switzerland. The court heard that after booking . the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with . whom he had become infatuated. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard that Graham and Ms Brown had been lovers for eight years despite the fact that Graham was already married . Jurors were told that Graham wanted . Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning . and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in. His . downfall came in 2009 when one of the banks Eric Brown had an account . with suspected fraudulent activity and called in the police. Mr . Justice Openshaw said he would pass sentence today on Graham, who was . also convicted of perverting the course of justice and had admitted a . number of fraud charges. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on Todd . who was accused of fraud, forgery and jointly accused of perverting the . course of justice.","Donald Graham, 59, found guilty of murdering lover Janet Brown, 45 .

"By . Larisa Brown . Mark Bushnell, the deputy headmaster of the prestigious Durham School, who was found dead on a beach in County Durham in March this year . The death of a deputy headmaster of a prestigious boarding school remains a mystery because ‘he had everything to live for’, an inquest heard yesterday. Mark Bushnell, 50, who worked at Durham School, left his family home on March 9 but he never returned and his body was found washed up on a beach weeks later. An inquest heard the married father-of-three had been ‘disappointed’ about being overlooked for a position as head of the £25,000-a-year school where he worked, but had accepted it and moved on. Speaking at Crook Coroner’s Court yesterday, his wife, Joanna, 48, said he would not dream of leaving her or their three sons, Jacob, 18, Nathan, 14, and Jonathan, 12. She said: ‘We were married for 29 years and we were still very much in love. He had so much to live for. He loved his job and he loved his boys and we had plans for the future. He would not dream of intentionally hurting or leaving us. ‘I could bring you in an army of people who could give you examples of why this is. This has obviously been dreadful for us and we can make no sense of it. It’ s just unfathomable.’ The family lived together at their £330,000 semi-detached home in Durham. Mr Bushnell left their home on a Sunday, March 9th, with a boot full of washing to take to the launderette as their washing machine had broken down. His locked car was found abandoned hours later at a beauty spot on the east Durham coast, with the washing still in the boot. A member of the public found Mr Bushnell’s body on a nearby beach close to Blackhall Rocks, where his car was discovered, a few weeks later on March 22. Detective Inspector David Cuthbert told the inquest how he had been spotted walking along the cliff side staring into the distance but was reported to have been ‘behaving normally’. He said: ‘When we found the body we had no explanation for his disappearance.’ Det Insp Cuthbert said police had . looked into claims Mr Bushnell had been ‘disappointed’ about not being . given a job as head of Durham School but had found no explanation as to . why Mr Bushnell would have killed himself. He . added: ‘We were aware that the headship job was about to be made . available, there was some talk about Mark being disappointed about being . overlooked for the position.’ He . said the job at the school had been Mark’s ‘life, together with his . family’. He added: ‘He had a love for the school and what it stood for. 'He loved his job and he loved his boys': Speaking at Crook Coroner¿s Court yesterday, Mr Bushnell's wife, Joanna, 48, said he would not dream of leaving her or their sons, Jacob, 18, Nathan, 14, and Jonathan, 12 . The inquest also heard how Mr Bushnell had previously had ‘an issue’ after moving from living within the school as a housemaster for 16 years, to then buying a property outside the grounds with his family to live in. Cuthbert said: ‘He went from being a housemaster for 16 years to buying a house outside Durham City. That certainly had been an issue.’ But he said he understood that issue had been dealt with long ago. Appointed deputy head of Durham School in July 2012, Mr Bushnell had worked at the school since 1993. Police forensics removing Mr Bushnell's body from the beach at Blackhall Rocks, in County Durham . Recording an open verdict, coroner Andrew Tweddle told the court: ‘So much of what has been said to me paints a picture of an ordinary man, a man without problems, a man who we would all perhaps want to be. ‘But he left the family home and drove to the coast, where he died. For a normal, ordinary man that doesn’t seem to make sense. I just don’t know what happened.’ He said he agreed with Mrs Bushnell that is was ‘unfathomable’. He said he ‘had so much to live for’, not only with his wife, but also with his job at the school.’","Inquest heard father of three was disappointed at not getting promotion .

"By . Larisa Brown . One is almost black and has an afro. The other is a blonde with the palest skin. Yet remarkably, Tyrelle and Tyreece Charles, from Cramlington, Northumberland, are twins, born six minutes apart. The pair, who could hardly look less alike, owe their appearance to a one in a million combination of their parents’ genes. Tyrelle, left, and Tyreece Charles, right, from Cramlington in Northumberland, are twins, but have completely different skin tones and colour hair . The chances of having a set of twins like Tyreece and Tyrelle, who were born just six minutes apart in October 2005, are a million to one . Mother Julia Charles has white parents and father Timothy Charles has a black father and white mother. The staggering result is a two-tone set of little boys. Now aged eight, the boys have the same cheeky smile and like to dress in the same clothes. They cannot spend a night without each other and are rarely seen apart. Their parents, both 50, said they were blessed with the boys, who are both beautiful in their different ways. Mrs Charles, a full-time carer, said: ‘When Tyreece popped out after Tyrelle the midwife and the nurses were utterly shocked. The doctor said he had never seen anything like it. ‘We’ve been told it is very unusual, and people are always amazed when we tell them they are both twins. ‘After they popped out, Tim just shouted to me, 'we’ve got one of each', and I couldn’t believe it. Tyreece was so dark and Tyrelle was lily white. Tyrelle, left, was born 'lily white' while Tyreece, right, was born 'so dark', their parents say . They might look different - but their mother Mrs Charles said it's easy to tell the boys are brothers when they play together . The two boys have looked different since they were born and have spent their childhood being questioned over the way they look . Each year, around 12,000 sets of twins are born in Britain. Of these, 385 of them are black or mixed race. The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of dramatically different colour are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a woman is of mixed race, her eggs will usually contain a mixture of genes coding for both black and white skin. Similarly, . a man of mixed race will have a variety of different genes in his . sperm. When these eggs and sperm come together, they will create a baby . of mixed race. But, very occasionally, the egg or sperm might contain genes coding for one skin colour. If both the egg and sperm contain all white genes, the baby will be white. And if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin, the baby will be black. For a mixed-race couple, the odds of either of these scenarios is around 100 to one. But both scenarios can occur at the same time if the woman conceives non-identical twins - another 100 to one chance. This involves two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time, which also has odds of around 100 to one. If . a sperm containing all-white genes fuses with a similar egg, and a sperm . coding for purely black skin fuses with a similar egg, two babies of . dramatically different skin colours are born. ‘It’s when they play together that you can tell they are brothers.’ The . couple, who have been together since they were 12-years-old, have five . other children, Salina, 34, Tristan, 18, Shellee, 15, Julia, 13 and . Clareena, 11. Salina, Tristan and Clareena are almost black, whereas Shellee and Julia are pale white. The twins, their youngest children, were born six minutes apart in October 2005. Tyrelle was born first and weighed two pounds heavier than Tyreece. Now Tyreece is quite a bit bigger than Tyrelle and likes to take care of him. But while they watch out for one another, they enjoy doing different things, explained Tyrelle. He said: ‘I’m white, I’m like me mam. I like watching Doctor Who but Tyreece doesn’t like it, he likes playing football. I like tennis and he likes playing with his friends.’ Mr Charles, who is currently not working after suffering a stroke, said: ‘We were chuffed, shocked and so surprised when they came out. I was completely made up. ‘It was hard getting them back off the nurses.’ Mr Charles said the younger of the two was very protective of his brother. He said: 'Tyrelle has learning difficulties so Tyreece is very protective of him. ‘Tyreece has been bullied in the past for the colour of his skin, but we tell him to just walk away. ‘People have asked whether Tyrelle is my adopted son, they would say 'he can’t be yours'. 'It is when they hear him shout 'Dad' and then people just ask and they find it unbelievable. ‘I think it is better they are . different, they get on so well and they can’t be separated. They curl up . in bed together like they are still in their mother’s womb.’ 'One of each': The eight-year-old twins owe their unusual appearance to a combination of their parents' genes . Their parents Julia, pictured left, and Timothy Charles, pictured right, both 50, said the boys are both 'beautiful in their different ways' Each year, around 12,000 sets of twins are born in Britain. The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of dramatically different colour - just like Tyrelle and Tyreece - are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a woman or man is of mixed race, their eggs or sperm will usually contain possible genes coding for black and white skin which, if they come together, will create a baby . of mixed race. Happy families: 8-year-old twins Tyreece and Tyrelle Charles pictured with their parents Julia, left, and Timmy, right, and their sister Julia, 13, centre. The couple have seven children in total . But, on rare occasions, the egg or sperm might just have coding for one skin colour. If this is the case in both the egg and the sperm, the baby will be white, or all black - depending on what coding the egg or sperm had. The odds of either of these scenarios is around 100 to one for a mixed-race couple. But, if the woman conceives non-identical twins, both scenarios can occur at the same time. There is about another 100 to one chance of this happening. This involves two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time - which also has odds of around 100 to one. If a sperm containing all-white genes then fuses with a similar egg, while a sperm coding for purely black skin fuses with a similar egg, two babies of dramatically different skin colours will be born.","Tyrelle and Tyreece Charles were born six minutes apart in October 2005 .

Wearing a Carnage T-shirt later in the night, Dee was pictured downing a pint and five shots as part of a drinking competition . Dee, who is on £10,000-a-year in sickness benefits in Birmingham, spent the first night of the holiday at an event organised by Carnage Magaluf . She . headed home yesterday to James Turner Street in Winson Green, . Birmingham, the deprived road where the Channel 4 show was set. Under the current benefits regime, Dee is allowed to undertake work and keep claiming disability living allowance. It is not against the rules to go on holiday if you are in receipt of benefits. But . claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensions immediately . if their condition changes, and proof that Dee is not in fact depressed . could lead to an investigation into her payments. The DWP said that it would not discuss individual circumstances. Those . claiming Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) can still claim . benefits for four weeks if you go abroad, but claimers must speak to . their local Jobcentre before they leave. Dee, . who is said to be on £10,000-a-year in benefits, spent the first night . of the holiday ‘making an appearance’ at a party, with drinkers paying . £25 a ticket for the privilege of her company. She did not receive a fee for attending. Alan . Collinson, of events firm Carnage Magaluf which organised the party, . said he did not know Dee was suffering from depression which stops her . from working for a living. He . said: ‘She came across as a good laugh. She’s off out tonight with us . on a bar crawl. I don’t think she is a big drinker though – she told me . she prefers tea and biscuits.’ He added that the £500 bottle of champagne was given to her for free. Dee . was also seen enjoying cocktails and laughing with guests at a Benefits . Street-themed pool party at the TRH hotel in the resort. Later in the night, she was pictured downing a pint and five shots in a drinking competition. The . trip was organised by Dee’s agent, Barry Tomes, who said the holiday . was a pick-me-up to help combat her depression, which has prevented her . from working for many years. He told the Daily Mail: ‘We’re trying to give her a bit of light-hearted fun. We’ve told her that if she can conquer depression we can make you a living and you won’t be on benefits any more.’ Although she looked like she was having a great time, she said of the trip: 'I'm not having a nice time. I miss my kids and I hate flying' The trip was organised by her agent, Barry Tomes, who said the holiday was a pick-me-up to battle her depression, which has prevented her from working for many years .

Mr Collinson said the £500 bottle of champagne she had been drinking was given to her for free . He said it was the first time Dee had spent more than a night away from her daughter, Caitlin, 16, and son Gerrard, seven. Mr . Tomes added: ‘Who said depressed people shouldn’t be enjoying . themselves? There’s nothing wrong with a person with depression getting . some sunshine. ‘I don’t . know how she can be accused of ripping off the state when she still . takes daily medication and still sees her doctor for depression.’ Onlooker . Amy Balfour, 21, of Sevenoaks, Kent, said: ‘People pay taxes and save . for holidays. She hasn’t done either.’ Dee became the face of Benefits .

She . revealed she receives benefits of £214 a week, but has since said she . would stop claiming the money  if she started receiving an income, . either because of the show or another job. Although . she worked as a barmaid, and was later a Birmingham City Council . administrator, she left in disgrace after being convicted of stealing . £13,000. She narrowly avoided jail in 2007 and was ordered to carry out 220 hours of unpaid work.

"By . Larisa Brown . A Labour MP was criticised yesterday after he posed for a picture with his son – who had blacked up for a fancy dress party. Ian Lavery, 51, smiled for the camera with Ian Jnr, who was dressed as Michael Jackson in Thriller. The picture which was then posted on Facebook incited racist comments from the 25-year-old’s friends. Blacked up: Ian Lavery Jr, right, dressed as Michael Jackson and posed alongside his MP father Ian Lavery, left, while giving a thumbs up sign . One called him a ‘n*****’ and an immigrant, to which Lavery Jnr responded by saying his father must be proud of him. His father, the MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland, held a pint as he appeared unperturbed by his son’s attire, which comprised of a wig, black face paint and him doing a ‘thumbs up’. His presence in the picture sparked outrage among the MPs’ constituents who said they found it offensive and ‘racist’. One said: ‘I was appalled and shocked when I saw these photos of Ian Lavery Jr. ‘These images show him dressed in an appalling racist costume, as well as this he has ‘liked’ every one of the racist comments posted next to the photo by his friends. ‘For the MP to have his photo taken with his son in this costume shows total disrespect.’ A Tory councillor said it was a ‘very public racist act’ and demonstrated the MP’s hypocrisy. It is not the first time Lavery Jnr, whose Twitter reads ‘Never base your life on other people’s expectations’, has sparked controversy. Last year he described Katie Price’s son Harvey, who is disabled, as a ‘vegetable’, while making a crude reference to the model. While Lavery Jnr describes himself as a funky house DJ, from Ashington, Northumberland, his brother, Liam Lavery, 20, has followed in his father’s footsteps and is a town councillor. Declined to comment: Mr Lavery is MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland . He posted the ‘racist’ photograph with the comment: ‘Me and the father’. His friends responded with offensive comments, including ones that he ‘liked’. One wrote: ‘ha ha f****** mint your dads probably thinking whos the immagrant (sic).’ Another wrote: ‘haha, he must be so proud of u lank’, to which Lavery Jnr responded, ‘must b’. One other Facebook friend wrote ‘lanky the n****’. The Facebook page has since been deleted. Councillor Peter Jackson, leader of Northumberland Conservatives, said: ‘There is a total hypocrisy with this very public racist act. ‘It seems the comments that go with it confirm that it is a racist act. ‘Ian Lavery as an MP is a very vocal and is always trying to take the moral high ground, this is a demonstration of his total hypocrisy. ‘The Labour candidates up here seem to think they can get away with any type of behaviour and they can get away with it.’ At the time of his ‘vegetable’ comment on Twitter, Katie Price, 35, criticised Lavery Jnr and his father, who is patron of brain injury charity Headway. She said: ‘This makes me sick to my stomach. Not just that someone could be so vile as to think such a thing, but also could think it clever to repeat to the world on Twitter? ‘What kind of father, what kind of MP, is Ian Lavery? He’s the patron of Headway - yet he brings his son up to think and act like this? ‘These disgusting comments aimed at Harvey all too often get aimed at other disabled children and the poor souls his father’s charity rightly campaigns for. ‘This is just as much a hate crime as racism and should be treated as such.’ Mr Lavery, 51, said at the time: ‘I’m absolutely appalled by it but I cannot police my kids and I have no intention to. They have to learn how to behave in the big wide world like I did.’ Lavery Jnr reacted angrily when initially confronted on Twitter. He said: ‘Does no f***** listen? Yes it was a sick joke that’s why it got deleted! Obviously some t*** managed to take a pic before it was deleted. Stop going on about it for f*** sake!’ But eventually he said he was ‘ashamed’ and apologised ‘unreservedly’ to Katie, adding: ‘I feel so stupid. I didn’t actually find it funny.’ Mr Lavery’s youngest son was yesterday very defensive about the photograph. He said he did not believe his brother or his father would want to comment about the picture. He said: ‘He didn’t post the comments on the picture.’ Mr Lavery and Mr Lavery Jnr declined to comment.","Ian Lavery, MP for Wansbeck, held a pint next to his son Ian Jnr .

"By . Larisa Brown . Parents claim their children have been left with nowhere to play after a local authority decided to rip out playgrounds to cut costs. Carlisle City Council will spend more than £10,000 bulldozing swings, slides and other play equipment at 21 sites. It says it will save £400,000 in maintenance costs but the move sparked anger among parents and children, who have been left with muddy wastelands. Parents, including Tracy Dixon (pictured with her son, Josh, four), claim their children have been left with nowhere to play after a local authority decided to rip out playgrounds to cut costs . The first most families knew about it was when bulldozers began tearing out equipment. Tracy Dixon says her four-year-old son Josh no longer had a place to play after their local playground was chosen as one of the sites to  be demolished. ‘I live right next to the park and I was able to keep an eye on Josh when he was playing,’ she said. ‘The first I knew about them knocking it down was when the bulldozers arrived at 8am one morning. ‘The nearest playground is a 15-minute walk away and apart from the fact that I have a three-month-old baby to consider, a lot of teenagers hang around there and it can be intimidating for the little ones.’ Elsie Baty runs a residents’ action group in the Botcherby area of  Carlisle, where two playgrounds have already been removed. ‘The council should be encouraging children to get out and play, not pulling the playgrounds down,’ she said. ‘Where are the kids supposed to go now? To get to the nearest playground they need a lift in a car. They’ll just end up hanging round on street corners.’ Opponents of the proposal claim that they were not consulted. Rob Betton, an independent councillor for Botcherby on Cumbria County Council, said locals were shocked by the unexpected nature of the council’s move. Carlisle City Council will spend more than £10,000 bulldozing swings, slides and other play equipment at 21 sites. It says it will save £400,000 in maintenance costs but the move sparked anger among parents . ‘They have just sent in the bulldozers and the diggers without so much as a by-your-leave to the residents,’ he said. ‘Parents have woken up to find their children’s playgrounds gone and massive holes in the ground where they used to be. ‘It’s all very well for the council to say they’re having to make cuts, but why should the children have to suffer? What they’re doing is an absolute disgrace.’ There are 69 council-maintained playgrounds in Carlisle. The council says the 21 to be dismantled had poor equipment and were underused. The savings would go towards maintaining the remaining 48 areas. But locals claim there was nothing wrong with the equipment that has been removed. ‘The money that it must be costing the council to pull it out doesn’t justify what they are doing,’ said resident George Little. A city council spokesman said: ‘We will re-landscape the sites, replacing fixed equipment with soft landscaping. The intention is to create play facilities in a safe environment and accessible to every child.’","Parents in Carlisle claim their children have been left with nowhere to play .

"By . Larisa Brown . The old stereotype is that it’s grim up north. Not so, according to a recent happiness survey... it’s more likely to be miserable in the smoke. Residents of towns such as Harrogate, Hull and Preston are the most satisfied with where they live. Researchers asked nearly 50,000 homeowners how they felt about the safety and neighbourliness of their area and how proud they felt of their property, along with several other measurements of happiness. Harrogate has been named the happiest place to live in the UK for two years running (file pic) Harrogate, the spa town famous for ‘healing’ mineral waters, was crowned as the happiest place to live in Britain for the second year in a row. In stark contrast to last year, more northern towns made it into the top ten, including Stockport, Inverness and Falkirk. And the survey by Rightmove showed someone living in Hull or Preston is generally happier with their surroundings than someone residing in London or in Oxford. Southern towns such as Croydon, Twickenham, Harrow and East London were named as the places where people are least happy. But last year, the majority of towns ranked most happiest to live in were towns in the south, including Exeter, Ipswich, Kingston Upon Thames and Bath. Ilford, East London, East Central London and Croydon made it in the bottom ten for the second year running. The survey asked people questions such as how proud they are of their home, whether they are satisfied with how it is decorated, how safe they feel in their community, whether they have enough living space, how friendly the neighbours are and whether they worry about the value of their property. Despite the booming property market in London and the average price tag in the capital standing at around £459,000, the 10 places where people reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with where they live were all situated within the capital. East London was named as the place where people are least happy out of all 111 places ranked, with Ilford, Croydon, East Central London, Twickenham, Harrow and West London also making the bottom 10 list. East Londoners ranked their area bottom of the survey for neighbourliness and were also the least satisfied with their home decoration, while those living in Croydon voted their area the least safe place to live. Meanwhile trendy East London remained the least happy place to live, with locations in the capital filling up the bottom of the league tables . The popular London commuter belt areas of St Albans and Guildford came in 12th and 13th place respectively in terms of the happiest places to live. Oxford came in 44th place in the happiness rankings and Cambridge was positioned at number 59. This put both cities behind Newport in South Wales which was at number 42 and Middlesbrough in the North East which was at number 39. Rightmove said Harrogate, where the average asking price is £309,133, scored top in the survey for safety, its sense of neighbourliness and recreation. Councillor Michael Newby, Mayor of the Borough of Harrogate, said: ‘The district has some of the most beautiful countryside in the UK, if not in Europe and beyond. ‘There is also a great community feel, which certainly makes life a lot happier for many people.’ The survey also found that people living in Kirkcaldy in Fife feel they have the most space to live in comfortably, while those living in West Central London feel they have the least. Rightmove found that someone living in the Kirkcaldy area could buy a six-bedroom house with eight acres of land for less than £800,000, but in West Central London this amount of money would only stretch to buy a one-bedroom flat. Meanwhile, people living in Preston, Lancashire were found to take the greatest pride in their home. Nottingham home owners were found to be least worried about the value of their property, and people living in Hereford were the most likely to say they are contented within their current property rather than moving somewhere else. Residents living in Blackburn, Lancashire were the most likely to say they choose to spend money on their home even if they do not have to. 1. Harrogate (1) 2. Inverness (-) 3.

"By . Jade Watkins . He only just landed back in Sydney after a trip to Dubai, and radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands is already in hot water. The 43-year-old was stopped for speeding by police on his way back from the airport to his St. Ives  mansion on Monday morning. The Kiis 1065 host admitted to his listeners on his breakfast show that he broke the law, telling them he was going 20kms over the 60km speed limit, according to the Daily Telegraph. In hot water: Kyle Sandilands was stopped by police for speeding on Monday morning. The shock jock was travelling 20kms over the 60km limit the same day he had arrived in Sydney after a week in Dubai . Not his fault: The Kyle And Jackie O Show host joked that the speed limit 'was too slow in Australia' in comparison to in Dubai . He added: 'I was flying, I thought I was still in Dubai.' Kyle explained he was pulled over at around 11.30 in the morning while travelling in his black 4WD with girlfriend Imogen Anthony and several male friends to his northern suburbs abode. He may now be slapped with a $435 fine and could have four demerit points stripped from his license. Traveling light? Kyle and his 23-year-old girlfriend Imogen Anthony exited the terminal with a large amount of luggage after their week-long stint in Dubai . Wide load: Kyle pushed an airport trolley piled high with huge suitcases as he left the terminal . Covered-up: Model Imogen was swathed in an all-black ensemble, including a cap on top of a large scarf wrapped around her head and chest . Kyle, who owns a fleet of some of the world's most expensive cars, including a Rolls Royce thought to be worth close to $1m, was fined for not having his driver's licence with him  after being pulled over in Sydney's Kings Cross in his black Lamborghini back in 2012. He was also caught speeding back in 2007, and at the time was slapped with a $500 fine and lost four demerit points leading to a reported three month driving ban. According the Daily Telegraph, on this occasion he was going more than 35km/h over the speed limit. The radio host reportedly did not contest the ticket and said that he would 'cop it sweet'. Just moments before the incident on Monday, the broadcast star was leaving Sydney International Airport with Imogen and friends. With his girlfriend by his side, he was spotted wheeling the couple's luggage through the terminals. Pop of colour: Imogen paired her plain black clothing with bright orange wedge Adidas heels and a matching Hermes handbag . All smiles: The blonde looked cheerful despite the long-haul flight . Helping hand: A scarf-wearing Kyle gets some help loading the huge cases into the boot of the car . The pair appeared to be well rested despite their near 14-hour flight after no doubt flying Business or First Class. Makeup free Imogen was dressed all in black except her bright orange Adidas trainers. She was seen carrying a matching orange Hermes handbag along with a shopping bag from lingerie store Victoria's Secret. Meanwhile, Kyle was also dressed in black and accessorised with a grey and white checked scarf and a baseball cap. Kyle had been in the United Arab Emirates city with Imogen and his breakfast radio co-host Jackie O, where the duo broadcast their popular program from for one week. All aboard: Friends helped the couple load their suitcases into the back of Kyle's black four-wheel drive .

"Grecko's ex-fiance believes that bankrupt Edelsten is a 'snake' Byrnne's manager say his client is moving 'on with her life' By . Jade Watkins . Geoffrey Edelsten has well and truly moved on from his ex-wife Brynne. The 71-year-old stirred up controversy when he stepped out with an even younger lookalike of his former spouse on Monday, as he attended the funeral of VFL great Tom Hafey in Melbourne. Now the controversial millionaire has spoken out his new busty blonde girlfriend Gabi Grecko, 24, for the first time, telling the Herald Sun that he is smitten. Smitten: Geoffrey Edelsten says he is smitten with his new girlfriend Gabi Grecko, who is 47 years younger than him and is the spitting image of his ex-wife Brynne . 'I’m very much so. She’s delightful. I’m very happy,' he said. However, the same may not go for his ex Brynne, 31, after Grecko posted an image of her and her new man kissing, hashtagging the snap #brynneedelsten. And it seems that Grecko's former fiance Kevin Johnn has also been left burnt. Causing controversy: Geoffrey caused a stir when he rocked up to the funeral of VFL great Tom Hafey on Monday in Melbourne with Grecko who was clad in a revealing Herve Leger dress . The former Project Runway contestant hinted that he and Grecko had never officially finalised the end of their three year relationship, and that the former reality star could not possibly be in love with Edelsten. He spoke of his concerns for the busty blonde getting involved with the bankrupt millionaire. 'She’s very, very special. A lot of people kinda have her wrong,' he said. 'He (Edelsten) is a huge snake and she’s not stupid. It’s going to be a disaster if she falls for him, and she knows it.' Racy: Grecko has posted several shots of herself clad in revealing lingerie . Happy together: Geoffrey and Brynne are seen cuddling up outside the Crown Casino in a picture that Gabi posted on her Pinterest page . According to Brynne's manager Rob Menzies, his client couldn't care less about the new relationship and that she should not be 'dragged' into the affair. Meanwhile, Grecko herself has spoken out to defend the revealing outfit she chose to wear to Hafey's funeral. Speaking about the tight dress with a plunging neckline, she told Nine News: 'I had come here not planning to go to a funeral.' Selfies: Gabi is a model and a DJ who is based in New York . She added: 'It was a sad thing, this was a really good friend of Geoff's.' And addressing whether her garment, a $2000 Herve Leger dress, was appropriate for such an occasion, instead of agreeing it was revealing, she appeared to believe she had been the victim of a 'malfunction'. She said: 'The malfunction with the cleavage … I have several Herve Leger dresses and they fit right. 'The only black one I have was that one.' With her blonde hair and curvy figure it hasn't gone unnoticed that Gabi bares a striking resemblance to Geoffrey's ex-wife. Revealing: Gabi is certainly not shy when it comes to her social media postings . However the buxom blonde, who is based in New York, says she can't see it. 'Do I? I don't think we do at all,' she said. 'We have a totally different style … we have a totally different body shape.' Gabi also appears to enjoy the party scene just like Brynne but perhaps these days are over now she is dating older man Geoffrey. It's unsure whether this is a serious relationship as this is not the first time he has been spotted with a mystery blond since he and Brynne went their separate ways. The ex-file: Geoffrey's ex Brynne, 31, is said to be moving on with her life .","Grecko's ex-fiance believes that bankrupt Edelsten is a 'snake'

"By . Rebecca English Royal Correspondent In Wellington . and Jade Watkins . She has suffered from several 'Marilyn moments' in the past. And once again the Duchess of Cambridge failed to tame her skirt as she touched down in a very windy Wellington, New Zealand, on Monday. Kate's red attire was picked up in a large gust of wind as she juggled baby Prince George and held onto her hat at the same time. Scroll down for video... Marilyn moment: The Duchess Of Cambridge nearly suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she touched down in Wellington, New Zealand on Monday with Prince William and baby George . Hands full: Kate was carrying baby George and holding onto the railing of the plane's stairs at the same time . Meanwhile, Prince William disembarked the plane looking carefree and dapper in a navy blue suit. It is not the first time Kate has suffered a hemline malfunction in the course of official duties. Her navy skirt blew up at a charity event in London last November and she almost came a cropper in a floral Project D dress as she arrived at Brisbane airport in 2012. And she only narrowly avoided a wardrobe disaster at Calgary Airport in September 2011 when her feather-light Jenny Packham yellow frock headed skywards. Hold onto your hat! Kate almost also lost her very expensive red pillarbox hat . Smart: Meanwhile, a hands-free William disembarked the plane looking dapper in a navy blue suit . Not again! This isn't the first time Kate has suffered from a Marilyn moment - a seven months pregnant Kate was hit by a gust of wind in 2012, a Jenny Packham yellow frock almost cost Kate her modesty at Calgary Airport in September 2011, and she almost came a cropper in a floral Project D dress at Brisbane airport in 2012 . The Queen's dressmaker Stuart Parvin slips small lead curtain weights, costing just £1.50 for a packet of four, inside the lining of each of the Queen’s exquisite hand-made outfits. The small circular weights, measure just 1.2inches (32mm) across and weigh less than an ounce each and are sourced from Peter Jones. Society dressmaker Mr Parvin stitches them into the hem of her garments, which prevents them from blowing up in the wind. ‘The beauty of a handmade outfit is that it hangs just right but, of course, we have a few tricks up our sleeve,’ Mr Parvin told the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview . ‘I just pop a couple into the hemline of her dresses and coats and it makes them hang beautifully. 'If there is a flap in the coat then I will sew in one on each side of the split to even it up. 'And sometimes if she is wearing a lightweight chiffon skirt I will sew in an even smaller lead weight the size of a pea or even a length of chain, rather like a dog’s chain. But the curtain weights work beautifully.’ It has been suggested in the past that Kate should perhaps take a leaf out of the Queen's book. In 2012, the Mail revealed how, despite conducting thousands of public engagements in her 60 years on the throne, the Queen’s decorum has almost never slipped. Slipped inside the lining of each of the monarch’s exquisite handmade outfits are a couple of small lead curtain weights, costing just £1.50 for a packet of four. The small circular weights, measure just 1.2inches (32mm) across and weigh less than an ounce each - but prevent the royal hemline from flying away in a gust of wind. Designer Jenny Packham revealed that she'd received a letter recommending that very trick after pictures of Kate in her billowing yellow dress surfaced in 2012. 'I had a little handwritten letter from a lady in Wisconsin passionately criticising me for the primrose yellow shift dress I made for the duchess,' says Packham, who was born in Southampton, told London's Evening Standard at the time. 'She said didn't I know about putting weights around the bottom of a hem so it can't blow up? 'Well, I didn't know it was going to be worn on a windy runway - but I did think maybe in future I will put in more weighting, just in case...' Stuart Parvin, the Queen's favourite couturier, revealed the weights he uses for her dresses are sourced from the curtain accessories section of famous Chelsea department store, Peter Jones. Society dressmaker Mr Parvin then sews them into the hem. The surprisingly cheap trick seems to work, for the Queen has seemingly never been photographed in public looking even remotely ruffled. ‘Surprisingly, it is nothing fancy. I use curtain weights, lead weights, from Peter Jones’s curtain department. We call them penny weights.' Mr Parvin said. Unfortunately not all female royals follow the Queen’s lead and have, on occasions, fallen foul of the elements. The late Diana, Princess of Wales, the Duchess of York and her daughter, Princess Beatrice, have all suffered similar wardrobe malfunctions. The Duchess of Cambridge arrived in New Zealand wearing a pillar-box red coat by Catherine Walker, a British designer favoured by William’s late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and a pillbox hat by  Gina Foster. She was also wearing the Queen’s diamond and platinum silver fern brooch, an important New Zealand emblem. The monarch was given the stunning piece of jewellery by the Women of Auckland on her own visit to the country in 1954  as part of her landmark six-month  Commonwealth tour. Earlier there had been some uncertainty as to whether the flight would even be able to land after dozens of planes were diverted from Wellington due to low cloud and heavy rain. But concern eventually evaporated after the couple were seen happily boarding their jet for the final stage of their journey around the world in Sydney. The family and their 11-strong entourage had left London on Saturday night, taking up the First Class section of a scheduled Qantas flight via Dubai. Disembarking 27 hours later in Australia, the Duchess looked elegant in a Max Mara wrap dress and beige suede £400 Manolo Blahnik heels, as she carried her waving son in her arms. Dressed smartly in a freshly pressed blue suit, William walked next to her carrying a battered brown holdall and a plush kangaroo backpack. A Royal New Zealand Air Force jet carried them on the last three hours of their marathon journey and will also ferry them around the country for the next ten days. Kate and her son had taken the opportunity to change during the flight, which arrived 20 minutes late and was greeted by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. Thanks to the services of her on-board hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker – who is being paid for by Prince Charles out of his private fortune – her famous flowing locks looked eminently salon-worthy.George, meanwhile, sported a summer ensemble in white. Among the entourage seen disembarking was George’s full-time nanny, Spanish born Maria Teresa Turrion Borallo, a quiet, studious figure, who has not been seen in public before. While the couple’s previous foreign tours have been dominated by chatter about Kate’s  wardrobe, George will clearly be the centre of attention as his parents spend the next three  weeks touring New Zealand  and Australia. Traditional: The young prince wore a cream cardigan over a white shirt, matching shorts and soft leather shoes and socks - ideal for a baby who has just started crawling. His outfit was a modern version of the smocked top and peach bloomer style shorts that William wore when he visited the country at the same age . Change of outfit: Both Kate and her son took the opportunity to change during the flight from Sydney to Wellington which was delayed by 20 minutes . Strong gusts: The Duchess' pillbox hat by Gina Foster managed to stay firmly in place despite the windy weather . Royal welcome: The family was greeted by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. Kate wore the Queen's diamond and platinum silver fern brooch, an important New Zealand emblem, that was presented to the Queen on her visit to the nation during her landmark 1953-54 world tour . Traditional welcome: The Duchess rubbed noses with a local dignitary as she and her husband were officially welcomed at Government House in Wellington later on Monday . Eyes front, Kate! She chatted to several Maori warriors as she made her way across the soggy lawn . The warmest of welcomes: William and Kate attended an official welcome ceremony on the lawns outside of Government House later on Monday where they rubbed noses with local dignitaries .","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge touched down at Wellington Airport with Prince George this morning .

"By . Jack Doyle . and Larisa Brown . A triple murderer who received an £800 payout for lost or damaged belongings was a serial claimant, it has emerged. Kevan Thakrar, 26, also pocketed £75 in a 2011 compensation case – for missing milk. The judge who handed the machine-gun killer his latest payout for damaged property, including nasal hair clippers, also presided over the earlier case. Triple killer: Kevan Thakrar was jailed for murdering three men over a £10,000 cocaine debt . Thakrar complained that ten cartons of . soya milk and ten of long-life milk, along with some toiletries had . disappeared as he was transferred between prisons. District . Judge Neil Hickman awarded him £50 to replace them and a further £25 . compensation because losing the items caused him ‘distress’ and made his . time in jail ‘more unpleasant than it should have been’. In addition to . claims for money, Thakrar has made nearly 250 complaints to the Prisons . Ombudsman in recent years – a body which receives only 5,000 complaints . from prisoners a year. Yesterday . it emerged Thakrar was accused of assaulting a woman police officer . only weeks ago in Manchester prison. Victim: Former prison officer Craig Wylde was attacked by Kevan Thakrar with a broken botyle, leaving the 32-year-old with cuts that reached the bone in his arm and causing him to lose eight pints of blood . Injuries: Mr Wylde was one of three prison guards attacked by triple killer Kevan Thakrar, using a weapon made from a 285ml chilli sauce glass bottle . The gangland murderer poured . excrement and urine over her – but staggeringly he is not being . prosecuted. In 2012 Thakrar attacked three prison officers with a glass bottle in an unprovoked attack but was cleared of attempted murder. Last . night one of his victims, Craig Wylde, revealed he is yet to receive a . penny in compensation despite being unable to work since the assault. The . 32-year-old said: ‘My future is ruined and he has got sympathy handouts . and I haven’t even had a sorry. I’m worried about my children’s future . because if I had been working I could have picked up the extra shifts . and worked harder to provide for them. I could have worked for another . 35 years.’ Of Thakrar’s . £800 award, £500 was given because officers did not apologise to him. Mr . Wylde added: ‘It is upsetting they are trying to save every penny when . it comes to giving me any compensation but at the same time are . rewarding him £500 in sympathy.’ He . and his pregnant wife Kat, 32, a community mental health nurse, have a . two-year-old and a newborn baby – but were forced to move into his . parents’ house in December as they were struggling financially. Peter . McParlin, chairman of the Prison Officers Association, said the award . for the nasal clippers and other items was ‘ridiculous’ and . ‘disproportionate'. ‘This is a high-security prisoner. As a . bare minimum he will be costing the taxpayer £50,000 a year to be kept . incarcerated,’ he added.

"By . Larisa Brown . One Direction faced mounting pressure to apologise yesterday as it emerged they had inspired young fans to experiment with drugs. Children as young as 11 vowed on social networking sites to try cannabis for the first time, saying one of the band members looked ‘hot’ in a video of him smoking it. The pledges by youngsters to copy the boys came as fans and parents tried selling their tickets for upcoming gigs online – for half the face value. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Anger: . Critics have urged One Direction's two members to apologise after children praised the 'joint' video . Viagogo, the world’s largest ticket marketplace, saw a 79 per cent spike in people trying to get rid of the tickets in the 24 hours after the footage emerged. Tickets for the majority of the concert venues – including Wembley stadium and Manchester’s Etihad stadium were being sold for as little as £24, with reduced tickets also available on sites such as Gumtree. Last night drug campaigners reacted with fury after the boy band still refused to say sorry, despite calls from fans, parents and politicians. One charity branded the stars ‘stupid young men dicing with death’ and said it was ‘horrendous’ they had not yet apologised or showed any remorse. Just hours after the Daily Mail’s website published footage of Louis Tomlinson, 22, and Zayn Malik, 21, smoking a ‘joint’ before performing in South America last month, they were back on stage in the UK. On Wednesday they played the Stadium of Light in Sunderland, on the first leg of a two-week tour. Tomlinson appeared tired and weary on stage – having allegedly struggled to sleep since the fallout – but he showed no signs of regret to the thousands of screaming young girls in the crowd. No remorse: Tomlinson and Malik on stage in Sunderland on Wednesday at their first appearance after the video . Damaging: Zayn lights up a 'joint' as he and Louis . Tomlinson are driven to their gig in Lima, Peru last month . Malik barely said a word during the 90-minute show. After seeing the footage, fans began tweeting using the hashtag ‘#zouispassmethatblunt’ – an amalgamation of the boys’ names followed by another term for a ‘joint’. One fan wrote: ‘I just turned 11 and idk [I don’t know] what a blunt is but I wanna [sic] smoke it #zouispassmethatblunt.’ Another added: ‘I know that marijuana isn’t good for us … but damn I want to try smoking weed with them.’ A Twitter user called Anthika wrote: ‘Zayn smoking weed is hot. I wanna try weed one day …’ But despite the Mail yesterday making the band aware of the potentially harmful effect their actions have had on young fans, a One Direction spokesman said their only comment was still: ‘This matter is in the hands of our lawyers.’ Lucy Dawe, of charity Skunk Sense, told the Mail: ‘They’ve got these young people that are hanging on to every word they say and instead of showing them how to behave, they are being the worst role models they could possibly be and encouraging young people to do something that could seriously damage their health. Enraged: Parents tried to sell of their children's tickets for the upcoming One Direction gigs for as little as £15 - half the face value - after the now infamous 'joint' video was published, ticket giant viagogo has said . ‘It is absolutely devastating. The young girls have absolutely no clue of the dangers of cannabis. They are stupid young men, dicing with death.’ A number of £30 seats at the band’s Sunday show in Manchester were offered for £15 online and a £42.50 ticket for Wembley was advertised at £24. A seller on Gumtree had listed their ticket for £0 and asked for someone to make an offer. A Viagogo spokesman said many ‘bargain’ tickets were now on sale at ‘half the box office price’. StubHub, a ticket re-sale firm owned by eBay, yesterday said there were 4,000 One Direction tickets available on the site. Many of the band’s young admirers turned on their former idols by posting photos of themselves ripping or burning their tickets. Half an hour before the Sunderland gig this week, band member Liam Payne tweeted: ‘Right everybody concert times lets try and keep the pg rating for Christ sake somebody help me restore sanity.’ Fellow member Harry Styles was said to be furious with Tomlinson and Malik. A source told the Sun: ‘Harry is annoyed … [he] thinks it was a stupid and reckless thing for Louis to allow to be filmed in the first place.’","Children as young as 11 said band member looked 'hot' smoking it .

"By . Matthew Blake . An erotic novelist has told of the moment she visited a church to research her next book ... only to discover a bundle of blue Ikea bags brimming with human bones. Kicki Karlén popped down to her local chapel in Kläckeberga, southern Sweden, to find inspiration for an original plot-line, when she was confronted with one she could scarcely have made up. And the author - whose last book was 'Eroticism under the Full Moon' - was so inspired by the macabre mystery that she now plans to use it in her next story. Grim find: The bags were covered by a tarpaulin sheet and have been sitting there since parts of the church were dug up and rebuilt to allow wheelchair access . 'I was thinking the book could be set in the Viking ages... the Viking history is strong in this part of the country - a perfect setting for some kind of love triangle,' she told The Local. But that's when she came across the collection of shopping bags containing dozens of remains that appeared long forgotten and left to gather dust. 'There were around 80 skeletons,' she added. 'And it made me very angry about how they were just sitting there. Some people at the parish told me the bones had been there since 2009.' She went on: 'It's not fair that people are just left behind like that, so disrespectfully. For me, it doesn't matter whether you're alive or dead, a life is a precious and meaningful thing. Too many people forget that nowadays.' Macabre: She had popped down to her local chapel in Kläckeberga, southern Sweden, to find inspiration for an original plot-line, when she was confronted with one she could scarcely have made up . The bags were covered by a tarpaulin sheet and have been sitting there since parts of the church were dug up and rebuilt to allow wheelchair access. Archaeologist Ludvig Papmehl-Dufay, who was part of the team which conducted the dig, told The Local that the bones may have been up to 500 years old. 'Our mission was to document and rebury the bones,' he said. 'But the reburial was delayed and I have no idea why. The plan was to rebury them as soon as possible, but that's up to the church. The county board said they couldn't leave church ground, and it became complicated.' While Papmehl-Dufay denied putting the bones in the Ikea bags himself, he admitted that it sounded like an efficient storage technique. 'It's not standard practice, definitely not for archaeologists, but the Ikea bags aren't actually that bad,' he added. 'They'd be great for stopping the moulding process. But it can't be that good to have them in the basement for so long.' Meanwhile, Ms Karlén says the bones could prove useful in her next erotic novel. 'You know, I just might put them in,' she said. 'I have to say I'm tempted.'","Kicki Karlén went to chapel in Kläckeberga, Sweden, to find inspiration .

"By . Matthew Blake . This must literally be the largest political cover up in China's history - a very dirty trick that's dragged one council's reputation right through the mud. Local officials in Sihong county in east China's Jiangsu province could not be bothered to wait for planning permission to build more than 20 new motorways ... so they built them anyway and covered them with earth to stop their paymasters spotting them by satellite. Central Government officials have clamped down hard on illegal building in the country using satellite imaging to spot unauthorized developments. But with the planning permission notoriously slow - many companies and even local government officials have been going ahead with projects anyway - hoping that the planning permission will follow by the time the building work is finished. Corruption uncovered! The officials could not be bothered to wait for planning permission for a prestigious new motorway and more than 20 highways, so they built them anyway in the country's eastern Jiangsu province . What under Earth? Central Government officials have clamped down hard on illegal building in the country using satellite imaging to spot unauthorized developments. but that didn't stop these officials . So when they got fed up with delays in applying for permission to build a motorway and 20 other much needed roads, they went and built them anyway - but then covered them with mud so that nobody would know - and even planted soya beans on top. The move meant that the illegal road did not show up on the National Land and Resources Bureau's remote sensing satellite - and the plan was to expose the road once the planning permission was granted. That, of course, meant that the road would appear to have been built almost overnight. Don't spill the beans! Incredibly, they even planted soya beans on top of the roads to make them look more authentic . Come to satellite: The move meant that the illegal road did . not show up on the National Land and Resources Bureau's remote sensing . satellite - and the plan was to expose the road once the planning . permission was granted . But they were caught anyway when local farmers who were not compensated reported them to central government. Villager Lin Feng said: 'The workers turned up in May 2010 and just dug up our crops and built a road that they needed to sign a contract for to get an industrial park. 'The road took a year to build and then they covered it with earth - but they never compensated us.' Miracle roads: That, of course, meant that the road would appear to have been built almost overnight . Up in farms: But they were caught anyway when local farmers who were not compensated reported them to central government . This is not the first time the stunt has been tried, as it was also used in Shuanggou town near Xiangyang city in Hubei province, in Central China when another road project was also covered with mud. But again they were caught by local informers. According to Miao Feng, the deputy director of Xiangzhou district of Xiangyang city, tax cuts meant many local councils had been under pressure to attract investment for example by building industrial estates. The road was needed to move ahead with the construction of the Shuanggou industrial park, mainly processing food. The local government was given a hefty fine for the illegal appropriation of the farmland.","Councillors in east China's Jiangsu province applied to build 20 motorways .

"By . Matthew Blake . Brace yourself, Rodney... Brace yourself! These two handymen have more than a little touch of glass... as they polish a giant chandelier in Vienna. The pair climbed onto the giant candelabrum at City Hall in the Austrian capital in scenes that echo a famous 1982 sketch from hit Brit sitcom Only Fools and Horses. But luckily for them it wasn't 'international year of the wallybrain' - as Del Boy astutely puts it - and they managed to clean the ceiling fixture breaking nothing more than a sweat. A glass act: These two handymen have more than a little touch of glass... as they polish a giant chandelier in Vienna . Brace yourself, Rodney! The scene echoed a famous sketch from hit Brit sitcom Only Fools and Horses in which Rodney (left), played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, and Del Boy (right), played by David Jason, unsuccessfully attempt to clead a pair of priceless Louis XIV chandeliers . Things did not, however work out so happily for Del Boy and Rodney in the 1982 episode of Only Fools and Horses that sees the hapless pair - played by David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst - attempt to polish a chandelier in a country house. During a trip out to the countryside Kent to buy a consignment of musical china cats which play the song 'How much is that doggie in the window?', Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad find themselves in the inadvertent employ of a wealthy aristocrat who hires them to clean two priceless Louis XIV chandeliers. Year of the wallybrain? But luckily for them it wasn't 'international year of the wallybrain' - as Del Boy so astutely puts it . High up: The chandelier hangs above Vienna City Hall's Council Chamber, where members of the City Council and Diet convene . Pros: The pair expertly shimmied across the ceiling fixture with apparent ease as they cleaned it without breaking more than a sweat . Striking: According to the City Hall's website, the 'most striking feature of this 14-metre-high room is a huge chandelier in the historicist style, with a diameter of five metres and 213 lights. It was cast in one piece, weighs 3,200 kilogrammes and can be entered by maintenance personnel to change the lamps' Frescoes: The coffered ceiling of high-grade larch and spruce wood is decorated with 22-carat gold-leaf rosettes while, drectly below the ceiling, a series of frescoes depicts events from the history of Austria and Vienna . When they arrive to perform the job, Del Boy sends Grandad upstairs to unscrew the holding bolt for one of the chandeliers while he and Rodney climb up step ladders with a blanket ready to catch it when it falls. Unbeknownst to them, however, Grandad is unscrewing the wrong chandelier and, sure enough, as they brace themselves to catch the antique above them, the other one crashes to the floor, shattering in pieces.

"By . Matthew Blake . Sorry: Tana Baumler, 59, was taking her husband and granddaughters, four and seven, to Yellowstone National Park, in Idaho, when she was caught speeding . A grandmother who was caught speeding with her two grandchildren in the car has sent a thank-you letter to the officer who gave her the ticket. Tana Baumler, 59, was taking her husband and granddaughters, four and seven, to Yellowstone National Park, in Idaho, in early July when she was clocked driving 95mph in a 75mph zone. State trooper Mike Nielson spotted her car careering along the highway and set off in hot pursuit, pulling her over when he caught up. But rather than assume the role of the stereotypical 'bad cop', he was the picture of warmth and kindness, according to Mrs Baumler. So much so that when it came to paying her $150 fine, the restauranteur felt compelled to enclose a little note thanking him for being so nice. 'I was going too fast,' she told ABC News, saying that when he approached her vehicle he went out of his way to put her granddaughters 'at ease', handing them stickers before writing out her ticket. 'They're . 4 and 7,' she went on. 'Sometimes you see the lights and a police . officer and you're scared, but he came up and talked to them and was . really nice. He had no attitude. He could have made it a bad day. But he didn't.' Alongside her cheque, her note read: 'Dear Idaho State Police, Recently I was on vacation with my . grandchildren and was pulled over for speeding. 'Officer Mike Nielson . made it a good experience for my grandchildren by talking with them . calmly and giving them stickers. He didn't leave me out and I got my . very own STICKER SHOCK :) Thanks for a great attitude.' At ease: Mike Nielson said he always tries to make children feel at ease saying it can be a little scary for them when 'the guy in the big hat walks up to the car' Officer Nielson told the channel: 'You usually just talk to the kids - the kids are just inquisitive when the guy in the big hat walks up to the car by the side of the highway and can be a bit nervous.' Mrs Baumler says running her own restaurant for 26 years had taught her the value of positive feedback. 'When anything bad happens, it's easy to be negative,' she said. 'If someone does a good job, it's always nice to say so.' Of her grandchildren, she added: 'I told them that you make these choices and that he was just doing his . job. I made a bad choice, so I [had to] pay the consequences.' Having told them that, she added, her eldest granddaughter recommended she hire Officer Nielson to work in her restaurant. Mixed reaction: As news of her story began to spread, it was met with mixed reactions online. Some praised her magnanimity, while others she had been irresponsible driving so fast with children on the back seat . As news of her story began to spread, it was met with mixed reactions online. On one comment board, 'RB in WV' wrote: 'I love happy news. Airstrikes in Gaza, Ebola spreads, Dow tumbles ... it's nice to have a break from all that.' But others were less impressed. Gabriella wrote: 'That was nice, although I don't know if I would have gone through the trouble of sending thank-you note if I got a $150 ticket; however, I wouldn't have been driving 95 in a 75 with kids in the car, either.'

He said: 'With the wind he had no chance of putting his umbrella up, but he was carrying it under his arm when it was struck leaving him severe burns on the abdomen.

After being taken to the Suzhou Municipal Hospital's burn centre, the medic that treated him, Doctor Guo Yu-xi, said: 'In my 32 years of practice, I've only seen about five or six lightning strike victims survive.' Guo added that the man will undergo surgery to repair damaged tissue once his condition is more stable and will remain under intensive care for up to 10 days to examine the extent of the damage caused to his internal organs. He added: 'All the indications are however that he will survive although the recuperation process is likely to be a painful one.'","Wen Kao, 29, was walking home in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province last Sunday .

Discovered: Theresa Mateo, 34, was found in an embrace with Scott Jacobi in a Staten Island Hilton on Friday after an apparent suicide pact . A couple who were found dead in each other's arms on the bed of a Hilton hotel room committed double suicide after 'a run of bad luck', a relative has claimed. The bodies of Theresa Mateo, 34 and Scott Jacobi, 37, were discovered by staff at the Hilton Garden Inn in Staten Island just before 1pm on Friday after they failed to check out. Investigators say their cause of death is yet to be determined, pending autopsy results, but sources told the New York Daily News that they believe the couple - who had been dating for about eight months - died in a suicide pact. 'They were having a run of bad luck,' a relative of Mr Jacobi's told the paper. Sources suggest they died from an overdose, even though no drugs or relevant paraphernalia were found in the room. The relative did not go into any further detail about the couple's misfortune but relatives of Ms Mateo's claimed they had experienced relationship problems. 'Theresa always said to me, ""I can’t find the right guy,""' one neighbor, who wished not to be named, told the paper.

The religious reptile showed his true colours this week when he reached out to confess to a figurine of St Francis. The shade-shifting lizard, from Oklahoma, suddenly seemed overcome by a sense of his own mortality as he sat down to tuck into his dinner of praying mantis ... so he said a little prayer of his own. He reached out his claws to the eight-inch statuette of the patron saint of animals - and then climbed on top of its head.

"By . Matthew Blake . 'Did did what I had to do': John McLaughlin was driving along the Interstate 70, in Golden, Colorado, when Christopher David Sullivan, 37, ran past his grey Hyundai pointing the high-velocity weapon at passing vehicles . A good Samaritan has been hailed a hero after he leapt to the aid of a police officer to tackle an assault rifle-wielding carjacker. John McLaughlin was driving along the Interstate 70, in Golden, Colorado, when Christopher Sullivan, 37, ran past his grey Hyundai pointing the high-velocity weapon at passing vehicles. He then saw a police officer in hot pursuit, pulling out his handgun before yelling at Sullivan to give himself up. 'He was out right away with his handgun drawn yelling, ""Get down. Get down!"" McLaughlin told ABC7. 'The guy had his hands up and he said, 'Don't shoot. Don't shoot!' That's when I knew it was real.' More officers soon arrived but seemed unwilling to step into the fray. But rather than cower behind his steering wheel and hope it would soon blow over, McLaughlin selflessly jumped out and came to the lone officer's aid. 'I . was just concerned that he might be able to get up with just one . officer on him so I thought, well I can assist and hold his legs down,' he added. 'It seemed like forever but if I wanted to count on the video . it was at least seven seconds -- it seemed like longer.' He added: 'One police officer said ... you could've saved a couple of lives. '[Another] said, ""I wish there were more people out there that would . respond to things like that like you did."" So that was very rewarding and . nice to hear.' The . manhunt for the suspect and his female accomplice first began after an . armed carjacking was  reported on Lookout Mountain, west of Golden, . Colorado. Around 4 p.m., a sheriff's deputy reported gunfire after he spotted the stolen blue Subaru Outback heading up Mount Vernon Canyon Road. Scroll down for video . Hero in lime: Rather than cower behind his steering wheel and hope it would soon blow over, McLaughlin (in a lime t-shirt) selflessly jumped out and came to the lone officer's aid . The manhunt for the suspect and his female accomplice, pictured, first began after an armed carjacking was  reported on Lookout Mountain, west of Golden, Colorado . The deputy radioed that the male suspect was armed with a rifle and a handgun, which was confirmed by the sheriff's office. ABC 7 Denver's chopper arrived on the scene and spotted the man dressed in dark jeans, a black tank top, and a baseball cap walking through the woods. A blonde-haired woman also wearing black and carrying a black backpack could be seen walking behind the man. The woman became separated from the man and was arrested around 4.15pm . The man continued on and tried to steal two dump trucks but was unsuccessful . She became separated from the male suspect and was was arrested by police without incident at 4:15 p.m. along U.S. Highway 40 near Mount Vernon Road, ABC reports. However, the male suspect continued on his crime spree. First, he walked into a highway maintenance facility and entered the cabs of two dump trucks, attempting to steal them, before walking away without success. After failing to start the dump trucks, at 4:17 p.m., he is seen entering a nearby home and then smashing a stolen car out of a closed garage door. He then entered this nearby home, stole and SUV and crashed it through the garage door . The suspect drove the SUV for a short time but ended up at a dead end and continued on foot . The suspect drove a short distance down a dirt road to the end of a dead-end next to Interstate 70. That's when he tried to stop vehicles on the interstate by waving his rifle at drivers. At least one vehicle slowed and then sped off before potentially being carjacked. At that point, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office veteran officer Deputy Fred Haggett engaged him. The cop pulls a gun on the carjacker as he runs towards a car . He then attempted again to highjack a car after pointing his rifle at motorists . Haggett . can be seen on the video speeding down the highway pointing his service . revolver at the gunman who continued to try and stop passing cars. The suspect then laid down his rifle but refused to surrender, again attempting to evade police by running down the interstate. He . was finally grabbed and captured by the motorcycle deputy and thrown to . the pavement where a brave motorist helped pin him down until backup . arrived. He finally appears to surrender then again runs away from police before he is taken down by the hero cop .

"By . Matthew Blake . and Jessica Jerreat . If Phil Collins has taught us anything, it is that You Can't Hurry Love - especially when its a love of collecting historical artifacts from a Wild West battle almost 180 years ago. After spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the Battle of the Alamo, the Genesis singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a Texas museum. The 63-year-old Genesis singer-drummer joked he'd spent 'all the money that I made from music' on 200-plus pieces related to the battle where 1,500 Mexican troops laid siege to 200 Texans in 1836. The Alamo: After spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the Battle of the Alamo, the Genesis singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a Texas museum . Homecoming: Collins made the announcement under the shadow of the Alamo itself in Texas . 'Some people would buy Ferraris, some . people would buy houses, I bought old bits of metal and old bits of . paper,' Collins said. 'It's at my home, in my basement in Switzerland. I . look at it every day, but no one else was enjoying it.' On Thursday, Collins stood outside the Alamo as he announced plans to donate his vast collection to the Texas museum. Collins . has been an Alamo aficionado since growing up in London and watching . actor Fess Parker portray Davy Crockett in 1955 Disney miniseries, 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier'. The series chronicled the frontier legend of Crockett, who eventually died as one of the defenders of the Alamo. The last surviving roll from the Alamo is included in the artifacts being donated to the Texas museum . A flattened cannonball, pictured next to a quarter for scale, is part of the collection . Defense: An assortment of weapons, from axes and knives to guns, below, are also part of the collection . 'I've . had a love affair with this place since I was about 5 years old,' said . Collins, who sweated in a button-down shirt and spectacles before a . cheering crowd of dignitaries and tourists who gathered in front of the . Alamo for the occasion. 'It was something that I used to go and play in . the garden with my soldiers,' he said. Collins . said his favorite artifact was also his first, purchased for him in the . 1990s by his then-wife: a receipt for the sale of the saddle of John W. Smith, an Alamo messenger who rode through Mexican lines and pleaded . for reinforcements before the battle. The . collection also includes a rifle owned by Crockett, his leather shot . pouch and a pair of powder horns Crockett is believed to have given to a . Mexican officer before his death — as well as muskets and musket balls . that belonged to Mexican soldiers. Phil Collins says he has been obsessed with Davy Crockett since he was a child . Last stand: The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (pictured: a painting of the battle which hangs at the museum) Lifelong passion: Collins, 63, said he became fascinated with the Alamo story when he was growing up in the 1950s watching the television series 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier' starring Fess Parker (right) as the eponymous hero (pictured with co-star Buddy Ebsen) Collins said he first visited the famed battle site while on tour with his band in 1973. Each band member was allowed to pick one place in the U.S. trip - and he chose the Alamo. 'I was just spellbound when I first saw . it in person,' he recalled. 'Having lived all my life, to see it in . books and movies and the pictures in magazines, it was really quite . extraordinary.' His decision to donate the items to the Alamo was because he wanted the collection - which he is still adding to - to be kept together, Texas Monthly reported. 'It doesn’t end my involvement with Texas history. It’s my intention to keep accumulating, keep collecting, and once I’ve lived with whatever I buy for a month, I’ll be shipping it here. 'I’m kind of a bit of a magnet now for things relating to the Texas revolution,' he said. Collins has agreed to ship the collection to Texas, but on the proviso that the museum updates the site and constructs a new building to house the collection. Phil Collins has written a book, The Alamo and Beyond, about his collection of artifacts . Helmets and explosive devices, which Collins has collected over the years, have been donated to a museum . Letters and other paperwork related to the Alamo are included in the donation . Cherished: For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events and has been re-enacted in film on numerous occasions, including in the 2004 movie, The Alamo (pictured) Another important relic is Jim Bowie's famous knife with which he is reputed to have fought tirelessly, killing many Mexicans during the onslaught. It was after him that the Bowie knife was named. For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events. Celebrated . in song, story and cinema, the story of heroism against all the odds . helped define the young nation's pursuit of liberty. The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. The leaders of the group included Davy Crockett (pictured), already famous as a frontiersman, storyteller and crack shot, and James Bowie, known for his distinctive knife. It has long been part of the Alamo legend that Crockett died fighting. News of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels, who defeated Santa Anna's army at the Battle of San Jacinto amid cries of 'Remember the Alamo!' The historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed Republic of Texas. The legend was firmly established by the 1955 Disney TV show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of Mexican soldiers closed in for the kill. It has since been the subject of a host of Hollywood movies, including a 1960 John Wayne epic and a . 2004 version with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton. In 2012, the year after he announced . his retirement from music because of health problems caused by drumming, . Collins wrote a 384-page book, The Alamo and Beyond: A Collector's . Journey. He added: 'I'm . just an enthusiastic amateur. What I know is out there to be learned, . it's just that I took the time to do it, because of the book and to find . out what I was buying.' Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that although the building that will house the collection is not yet built, some items will be displayed as soon as October. The collection is worth millions but Collins said, 'Being British, we don't talk about that kind of thing.' He told the Guardian: 'I'm not extravagant in other ways, I live a very simple . life. Pretty simple. I mean, I came down here from New York in a private . plane so it's not that simple. 'But on the other hand, I don't buy . extravagant items like cars, expensive houses, jewellery. I've got no . other expensive interests. 'My interests, for the last 25 years anyway, . have been relics, buying things that are attached to something that I . feel very interested about. Even I have a limit … I was offered . something once for a million dollars.' He said his love affair with the battle itself centred on the fact that 'people came here and made a stand here – for good or bad'. 'That's another . political can of worms,' he told the paper. 'But for good or bad they came here knowing . they were going to die, hoping they weren't but knowing they probably . would, and that appealed to me even at six or seven, the idea of being . that brave.'","Collins donated 200-plus pieces related to the 1836 battle to museum .

"By . Matthew Blake . and Sean O'hare . Two best friends who made a drunken bet to row the Indian Ocean despite never having rowed before not only set a world record but have now become film stars since completing the perilous journey. James Adair and Ben Stenning, both 32, nearly died several times during the 116-day trip - including having to spend five hours in shark-infested waters after their boat capsized. But the pair survived, and now their heroics have been dramatised in a documentary by filmmaker Ben Finney, called And Then We Swam. Ready to go: This still from Ben Finney's film shows James Adair (right) and Ben Stenning, both 32, at the airport before setting off on their adventure in 2011 . Remember Hemingway: After spending he next seven years toiling in jobs they hated, the friends remembered Ernest Hemingway's famous words, 'always do sober what you said you'd do drunk,' and began raising money to buy a boat - which they did with their £15,000 life savings . Brave: The film charts the ups and downs of their 116-day adventure that saw them lose their navigation equipment to a storm and swim in shark-infested waters after their boat capsized . And Then We Swam: Now, their heroics have been dramatised in a documentary by filmmaker Ben Finney, called And Then We Swam . They made the crazy wager as Russian literature students at prestigious St Andrews University in 2004, prior to graduating. They . soon forgot the bet, spending the next seven years toiling in jobs they . hated. But by 2010 the friends had had enough of their mundane lives . and, one day, remembered Ernest Hemingway's famous words, 'always do sober what you said you'd do drunk.' Ben said: 'It stemmed from not being . happy with what we were doing. We were living in an awful, . mouse-infested flat, I was a fully integrated accounting software . salesman and hadn't sold anything in the six months I had been there. James was doing a law course he wasn't really interested in. 'An article about Jim Shekhdar, the first person to complete a solo . unassisted non-stop crossing of the Pacific Ocean, had just come out and . over red wine on a wintery Sunday evening, just as the pay-as-you-go . electricity was about to run out, we decided to give it a go.' After spending their £15,000 combined life savings on an ocean rowing vessel, they set out to conquer the high seas alone - almost losing their lives in the process. They not only succeeded in crossing the Indian Ocean in 116 days, but also became the first ever pair in history to row it without a support boat. Fresh-faced: Ben Stenning (left) and James Adair (right) at their graduation ball at St Andrews in 2004, where they first discussed rowing an ocean, only for their friends to dismiss the idea as a pipe dream . Eight years on: James (left) and Ben (right) after succeeding in crossing the Indian Ocean after 116 days at sea. This was taken the night they were dramatically rescued one mile out from the Mauritian coast after a freak wave capsized their boat and dumped them in the sea for five hours as their family waited anxiously onshore . What a team: The pair rowing together about two weeks into the trip judging by the length of their beards . Ocean sunset: Ben with his back to the setting sun as he smiles for the camera after a hard day's rowing . Rough seas: Ben with his trusty headband on, working up a sweat on the high seas . The pair lost about three stone and survived on a diet of freeze-dried food, rationed cigarettes, whisky and a sense of humour. Their fresh water-making machine broke which meant they also had to use a hand pump for two hours a day on top of the 12-hour shifts they each put in on the oars . Strong arms: James at the hand-pump. It took an hour to make a litre of fresh water. And a minute to drink . James, who wrote a book about the adventure, said: '[My book] Rowing After the White Whale is an account of our unsupported . row across the Indian Ocean, a journey which fewer people have completed . than have walked on the moon. We yearned for a big adventure and we . certainly got what we asked for. 'It's a story of moonbows and meteor showers, passing whales and thieving fish, lurking sharks and giant squid; it is part adventure narrative, part blue water history, part meditation on nature and part memoir.' Despite warnings that emergency rescue teams could take up to two days to reach them, and against their better judgement, they set off from Perth, Australia in Spring 2011. For the following 116 days their home was a one ton, 26ft, self-righting ocean rowing boat, packed with 300 . kilos of dry foods (mainly curry), navigation equipment, a desalinator, some whisky and cigarettes (rationed to one each a day), and their self-imposed limit of three books each. While one slept in a seven foot by four foot water-tight cabin the other rowed for two hours. What makes the feat even more impressive is that James, at 14, contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome, a debilitating illness which affects the peripheral nervous system and left him in a coma for a month, totally paralysed but conscious. Route: The pair managed to cross the Indian Ocean in 116 days despite having no experience prior to their trip . This was taken minutes after they were rescued from the sea. A helicopter had tried and failed to locate them. Fortunately for James and Ben, two locals headed out on their boat to help the search party and spotted them after finding a floating oar from their wrecked boat. Their family waiting onshore had started to fear the worst . His recovery took over a year and left . him with paralysed feet. Ben stood on a stonefish while growing up in . Africa and underwent two years of operations as tropical disease doctors . battled to save his leg. The newly-released book 'Rowing after the White Whale', written by rower James Adair . As the book explains, the adventure . was something the pair discussed as St Andrews University, with their . friends dismissing it as nothing but a pipe dream. After graduating in History (James) and English (Ben) the pair lived together in a flat in Brixton, south . London and soon became unhappy with their respective jobs. Both . men contributed £400 a month to their boat fund, which they used to buy . a £15,000 craft that has twice crossed the Atlantic with previous . owners. But he journey was far from plain sailing, or rather rowing. Just after the halfway mark a giant wave smashed down on the boat just as James was stepping out of the cabin, breaking the onboard navigation system (GPS) and desalinator system. 'We were forced to use a handheld GPS which just gave co-ordinates but nothing else (unlike the proper GPS which showed speed and course which you can use to plot you way. 'But dwindling batteries meant we only switched handheld on now and then and just used the compass to navigate.' Tweets made by the pair during the journey. Humour was something they relied on to keep spirits high. Often they would row all day only to find that the current had actually pushed them back. On their last day, just as they caught sight of land for the first time in 116 days and their family and friends arrived to greet them, another huge wave, this time only bigger, capsized their boat and threw them both overboard. Ben managed to rescue a flare from the boat, which he let off, only for the flare's cap to backfire in to James' leg. With blood streaming into the depths of the shark-infested water, the pair clung together for five hours until a local rescue team miraculously found them and brought them to dry land and into the arms of their parents who had all but given up hope of find them alive. Rowing After the White Whale: A Crossing of the Indian Ocean by Hand, by James Adair is published by Birlinn, is now on sale priced £12.99. Reunited: James with wife Tory who had flown out to greet him. She brought with her Boost chocolate bars, something he had craved while at sea. Prior to setting off she had given him a packet of letters for the journey. He was instructed to open one every two weeks - something that kept him going when things got tough . Ben and James with the men and their sons who decided to join the search party and who carried on looking for them even when the helicopter turned back. They found them after five hours bobbing in the sea - and are pictured here with the capsized boat's oars.

"By . Matthew Blake . Back on Twitter: As his trial over the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp draws to a close, the Paralympic athlete spent Sunday afternoon on the social networking site . Oscar Pistorius has broken his Twitter silence with a series of bizarre tweets including photos of him posing with children and a passage from the memoir of an Auschwitz survivor. As his trial for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp draws to a close, the Paralympic athlete spent Sunday afternoon on the social networking site. The last time he left a message was on February 14th, the first anniversary of the day he shot dead Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door of his Pretoria home. In one of the tweets, he posted a photograph of his finger resting on a page from Victor Frankl's memoir, Man's Search for Meaning, in which the Austrian psychiatrist recounts his time as a prisoner at Auschwitz death camp during the Second World War. The passage included the words: 'The salvation of man is through love and in love. 'I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.' In another tweet, he attached a collage of photographs of him helping children with disabilities around the passage: 'You have the ability to make a difference in someones life. 'Sometimes it's the simple things you say or do that can make someone feel better or inspire them.' Finally, the South African known as 'The Blade Runner' posted a message that read: 'Lord, today I ask that you bathe those who live in pain in the river of your healing. Amen.'

He could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing. Additionally, he faces separate gun-related charges. The tweets come three days after Pistorius' defence team closed its case in the murder trial of the Olympic athlete. Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year . Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on July 30 and the defence will do so on August 4. The 27-year-old athlete says he killed Steenkamp by mistake, thinking an intruder was in the toilet and about to attack him. The prosecution says he shot her after a Valentine's Day argument last year. Pistorius was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle. Part of his lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old. Drawing to an end: A woman adjusts the tie of South African Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius during his ongoing murder trial in Pretoria. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on July 30 and the defence will do so on August 4 . Last week saw Mr Nel challenge the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability. Mr Nel said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner. The defence maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house. Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a 'forensic report' but disputed Mr Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively.","Last time he tweeted was February 14, the anniversary of Reeva's death .

Capsized: The daring rescue took place at around 1am on Saturday after the four-man rowing boat began taking on water in the Pacific Ocean about 75 miles west of San Luis Obispo (pictured: a capsize training exercise before the race began) With little more than a flashlight on his helmet to see, PO3 Leon managed to hoist three of the men to safety. But because there was no room left in the helicopter, PO3 Leon stayed with the fourth rower for three hours while the chopper ferried his friends to dry land before it returned to pick the pair up at 4am. 'This was the most challenging rescue I've ever had,' PO3 Leon, an Air Station San Francisco rescue swimmer, said in a statement. 'It was unique because there was no . light, seas were incredibly rough, and waves were crashing over the top . of the boat, which was already filled with water,' Leon added. Training: They had been taking part in the Great Pacific Race from Monterey, California, to Hawaiian capital Hono­lulu when they ran into trouble in bad weather . Ready, set, go! The Great Pacific Race is a 2,400-mile competition from Monterey, California, to Hawaiian capital Hono­lulu . All four rowers are reportedly in good condition and did not require further medical attention. It was the second time authorities were called to help during the inaugural 2,400-mile competition this weekend. At 6am on Sunday, a solo rower was hoisted from his boat to a helicopter after capsizing several times in rough seas about 50 miles west of Morro Bay. Organizers identified the rower as Jim Bauer, who the federal agency said was in stable condition. Bauer called the Coast Guard with a satellite phone, and his boat was equipped with a satellite tracking beacon. 'A lot of planning was involved in this particular rescue, due to low visibility and challenging weather conditions,' said Lt. Cmdr. Blake McKinney, a Coast Guard pilot based in San Francisco who was involved in Bauer's rescue. The rower was well equipped for the Great Pacific Race from Monterey to Hono­lulu, filing a float plan, bringing a satellite phone and ensuring he had appropriate gear for the rough seas, McKinney said. Those preparations 'increased his chance for survival,' the official said.","It took place at 1am on Saturday during the inaugural Great Pacific Race .

Sasha was the second child of Anya and Andrey Tikhonenko, the 28-year-old father of the baby. Aleksey, his elder brother aged two, was with a relative when the accident happened. His death has triggered sudden inspections of all the elevators in apartment blocks in the area where he died. The lift in which he died was made in 1981 and should have been replaced a decade ago, according to media reports. Police are advising that mothers with babies should remove them from baby carriages before they enter elevators. 'This is a terrible tragedy, and it's a mystery how it happened but we are looking into it,' said a spokesman.","Anya Tikhonenko, 28, was with her baby Sasha after visiting friends in flats .

"By . Martin Robinson . A group of Christian and Muslim parents are in revolt after they were told their children would have to attend a Hindu school that bans meat and offers regular meditation and yoga. A shortage of places in South Woodford, east London, has led to more than 20 children being placed in Avanti Court Primary School. But 11 sets of parents have declined the places, leaving their children, aged four and five, with nowhere to go this September. Row: Christian and Muslim parents are angry their children have been offered places at Avanti Court Primary School, a Hundu school that insists on vegetarian meals, yoga and meditation . Liz Beck, of South Woodford, was 'not comfortable' with the school's 'strict no meat policy' and practice of yoga and meditation, so she turned down her child's place. She added: 'Culturally it's quite different and even though we don't want to shelter our son we feel it would be difficult for him to be in that environment where it's quite different from what we believe.' Muslim mother Naz Qureshi, also from South Woodford, told the BBC Asian Network she was outraged that her four-year-old daughter had been refused a place at all six of her chosen schools. She said: 'I didn't want her to go to a Hindu school so I am surprised the council would think I would accept a faith school which I didn't even apply for.' Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'Tolerance of other faiths and ways of life should be taught in schools. I'm just taking exception with the fact they want to restrict my child's diet. 'I'd demand to put what I want in packed lunches, but in winter who wants a sandwich? I want my child to have a hot, meaty dinner.' Delicious: This weekly menu from the school shows what its typical lunches consist of, but parents are unhappy about the restrictions on diet because it is completely vegetarian . A Redbridge Council spokesman said: 'On the few occasions where it is not possible to offer one of the preferred schools, Local Authorities are required to offer an alternative place, which is usually based on the geographical proximity to the child's address. 'This will include any faith schools that have not been filled at allocation.' Children aged four to 11 at the school are taught the standard curriculum, as well as many specialist Hindu faith-based classes, including Sanskrit and yoga. The school website states: 'Character formation will be achieved through provision of classes in yoga and meditation, and a vegetarian diet that is healthy and freshly cooked.'","11 parents said no to their children attending Avanti Court Primary School .

"By . Matthew Blake . and Wills Robinson . An escaped murderer who had been jailed for life for killing a British couple on their Caribbean honeymoon has died after being shot by police. Avie Howell, 24, who shot Welsh newlyweds Ben and Catherine Mullany in 2008, was caught in a rural parish just south of the capital, St John's, before a 'confrontation' broke out. He was shot in the knees and died in hospital three hours after climbing over a 30ft-wall at the holiday island's prison. At large: Avie Howell (left) was one of two men sentenced to life in prison for the murder of newlyweds Ben and Catherine Mullany (right), from Pontardawe, South Wales, as they honeymooned in Antigua in 2008 . He had been on the run since yesterday after he and his cellmate, who was . on fraud charges, had cut through a wire fence and scaled the perimeter. Howell and accomplice Kaniel Martin, 27, were . convicted of killing the couple in 2011, who had only been married for two weeks. They had burst into Mr and Mrs Mullany's chalet at the Cocos Hotel in a dawn raid in July 2008. The . newlyweds, who lived in Rhos, near Pontardawe, were both shot in the . head while their killers made off with their mobile phones, a cheap . digital camera and a handful of cash. Corporal . Thomas said: 'This morning, the police acting on a tip-off on . information they had received regarding his his whereabouts went to that . area where a confrontation took place between him and the police which . resulted in him being shot. 'He was rushed to hospital and roughly at about midday, he was pronounced dead.' The couple, who were both 31, had only been married a little over a fortnight when they were shot. Tragic: The 31-year-olds, who lived in Rhos, near Pontardawe, were both shot in the head while their killers made off with their mobile phones, a cheap digital camera and a handful of cash . Murder scene: Howell and Martin burst into Mr and Mrs Mullany's chalet at the Cocos Hotel (pictured) in a dawn raid in July 2008 . Mrs . Mullany, a hospital doctor, died instantly, while her trainee . physiotherapist husband, was flown home to Swansea in a coma. Despite . the best efforts of his wife's medical colleagues he died a week after . the shooting. It meant that . just five weeks after happily celebrating their wedding at St John The . Evangelist Church in Cilybebyll, their grief-stricken parents were . attending the couple's funeral. Then . three years to the day after the deaths, Howell and Martin were found . guilty of murdering the honeymoon couple as well as shooting 43-year-old . local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson. The . pair had yet to stand trial for the 2008 alleged murders of Rafique . Harris and Tony Louisa. Those two killings happened just a few weeks . after Mr and Mrs Mullany were shot. In . the wake of the murders, the couple's family set up the Mullany Fund - . which saw Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson and Antiguan cricket legend Sir . Vivian Richards become patrons.

Fighting for life: Qualified doctor Mrs Mullany died instantly while physiotherapy student husband - who was studying for his degree at the University of West England, Bristol - was flown home on a life-support machine (pictured). He died a week later . Happy together: The couple's family were said to be 'extremely shocked' at the news that one of the killers had been able to escape . Three years to the day after the deaths, Howell and Martin were found guilty of murdering the honeymoon couple as well as shooting 43-year-old local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson. The killers were both jailed for life. Friends of Ben and Catherine Mullany say they were 'destined to be together'. But tragically within a month of celebrating their wedding, they were buried alongside each other at the church where they were married. The eldest child of Cynlais and Marilyn Mullany, Benjamin Mullany grew up in the Swansea Valley village of Ystalyfera along with younger brother Adam. He was a talented rugby player and part of the Cwmtawe Comprehensive School team, which won the Wales school championship in 1993. Nicknamed by pals as 'Muscles Mullany', Mr Mullany also served in the Army and was shot while deployed in Northern Ireland. He also worked for a while as a police officer in Sheffield, but left after finding elements of the job - such as breaking bad news to relatives of people who had died - as 'too distressing'. They met by chance in a pub close to their home villages. Despite growing up a few miles from each other, their paths did not cross until they were in their late 20s. In 2006, he enrolled at the University of West England, Bristol, to study an undergraduate degree in physiotherapy. During his studies, Mr Mullany went on a work placement scheme with professional rugby team The Scarlets, in Llanelli. Last year Howell was handed an additional four-year sentence for a burglary he carried out just weeks before murdering Mr and Mrs Mullany. The couple's family were said to be 'extremely shocked' at the news that one of the killers had been able to escape. They were also concerned that Howell might flee the island. A source said: 'You would have thought they would have kept him under lock and key.' Following the verdicts, which came three years after the killings, Mr Mullany’s parents, Cynlais and Marilyn, and his wife’s mother and father, Rachel and David Bowen, broke down in tears. In a joint statement, they said at the time: ‘There is no joy at today’s verdict, just a sense of relief that after three years of waiting there is justice for our children. ‘These two individuals can never again inflict the same anguish and devastation to any other family as they have to ours. 'We will never be able to comprehend the senseless nature of their deaths, the total disregard shown for human life and that no remorse has ever been shown. 'Ben and Cath will live in our hearts forever. They made our lives happy beyond measure and enriched every day that they were with us.' The Honeymoon Killings, as they became known, shocked the tiny nation of Antigua, which had touted itself as a safe tropical honeymoon destination. The Mullanys’ stay at the five-star Cocos resort had been a wedding present from friends and family. Guests described hearing screams from their cottage on July 27, 2008, before gunshots. Martin and Howell, who had been enjoying Antigua’s carnival celebrations hours before, seemingly targeted their cabin at random. The gunmen, who refused to face questioning in court, protested their innocence throughout the trial. Their silence means the motive remaines unclear. They were snared after SIM cards registered to them were activated in Mr Mullany’s stolen phone within hours of the shootings.","Ben and Catherine Mullany were shot on the holiday island in 2008 .

"By . Martin Robinson . Fresh charges: More women have come forward after Rolf Harris' conviction for child abuse which could lead to further charges . Rolf Harris could face fresh sexual abuse charges because more women have already come forward after his conviction for 12 indecent assaults. The Australian star was yesterday found guilty of a string of sex attacks on victims as young as seven over 18 years. The Director of Public Prosecutions said today the celebrity's conviction has given others the courage to come forward and report sex attacks. But Alison Saunders said it is too early to say whether Harris, 84, will face fresh criminal charges over claims from women who say they were also abused. 'We know there has been more reporting, what we don't know yet is whether or not more charges will follow,' she told BBC Breakfast. 'We will work with the police and look at any cases that they send to us to see whether there is enough evidence to bring more charges. So it is too early to say really.' Ms Saunders said Harris had been exposed for using 'elements of grooming' when targeting his daughter's best friend, who he indecently assaulted over many years beginning when she was just 13. She added: 'These were nasty assaults committed by a man who thought he was not going to be discovered and who thought he was above the law.' Harris was revealed as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character who had a dark side to his personality and used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before abusing them with impunity. 'He committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law', Scotland Yard said. Scroll down for video . Damning: Harris, pictured leaving court yesterday with his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi, after he was found guilty of 12 historic sex attacks with unanimous verdicts . But Harris' conviction was put under threat because his arrest was kept secret because of draconian threats to newspapers from lawyers citing the Leveson Inquiry. The legal bullying meant the Press did not name the paedophile predator until four months after he was first quizzed by detectives. When the news blackout ended, a flood of other victims went to the police to back up the first woman’s claims. But asked if more women might have come forward if Harris' name had been publicised earlier, Mrs Saunders said it was a 'difficult balance to draw'. Non committal: DPP Alison Saunders says she is not sure if Harris will face fresh charges but is aware of the new accusations . She said: 'It is difficult, there are arguments on both sides - some people feel that they have been named and then if no charges are brought their reputation has been tarnished. 'But at the same time we have seen both in Rolf Harris and in other cases that if victims know that people are reporting that someone has been arrested they feel safer in coming forward , they feel they are not the only one and therefore we have seen more and more victims coming forward as people have been named.' Harris is the second celebrity to be convicted under Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Ms Saunders defended the police probe, saying it showed 'no-one is above the law'. And she dismissed criticism that only a few of the high-profile arrests of celebrities had so far resulted in convictions. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What you have to remember is that we get it right in 86% of cases, we get convictions in 86% of those cases that we take. 'So we are not risk averse, we have to be very careful that we don't get to a situation where we only take very short cases. 'It's a matter for the criminal justice system and the juries to decide whether or not they believe, and whether they are satisfied on the basis of all the evidence that we put before them. 'That's a very different test from the one that we take, which is, is there a realistic prospect of conviction.'","Director of Public Prosecutions says there are already new sex abuse claims .

The Hemi Cuda - fitted with a seven-litre V8 engine producing more than 425bhp - has been described as the 'Holy Grail' of muscle cars as manufacturers including Dodge, Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth all battled to produce race-quality cars easily capable of 150mph but with proper   suspension and handling. The Barracuda was designed by a 27-year-old auto whiz-kid John Herlitz whose ideas were originally dismissed by the manufacturer - one critical fellow designer put an axe through the clay model of the proposed car.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . It was a conflict which would engulf millions of lives, end empires and change the face of the world - and war itself - forever. One hundred years ago yesterday the first shots rang out of what would later be called the First World War - though at the time it would have been hard to predict that the conflict between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Serbia would spread like wildfire across Europe and beyond. Armies of the great powers - the British Empire, Germany, France and Russia - had been swelling their armed forces, still made up of cavalry units and gleaming bright uniforms, for years. But a new era of trenches, artillery and machine-guns would consign these relics to the past as fighting men from across the globe dug in for years of protracted combat which would also see the birth of chemical weapons, tanks and fighter planes. As these evocative archive pictures show, the Great War took a bleak and heavy toll from the lands it touched, both on its landscape, settlements and - most of all - the fighters who never returned or came back scarred and crippled, who are still remembered today.

"By . Martin Robinson . Caught on camera: Career criminal Calvin Reid has been jailed for two years after he stole a cancer patient's handbag and was identified after he was chased and this picture was taken . A career criminal with 227 convictions stole a cancer patient's handbag as she lay in her hospital bed but was caught after mattress delivery men gave chase and took a picture. Calvin Reid, who has been banned from virtually every shop in Britain, was described as 'the lowest of the low' by a judge who jailed him for two years. The victim, a 67-year-old woman, was receiving treatment at Essex County Hospital, Colchester, when she woke to find Reid leaning over her bed and then saw her handbag was missing. Hospital staff suspected Reid, 46, was the culprit and chased him before confronting him outside. Alan Price, a hospital contractor who had joined the chase with colleague Jamie Thompson, wrestled the bag off Reid and took a picture of him on his mobile phone. Police used the image to identify Reid and arrested him. Reid, 46, of Colchester, admitted theft when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court and was jailed for two years. Judge Patricia Lynch QC told Reid: 'You are the lowest of the low.This was particularly mean and unpleasant. 'Your victim was lying there prone, asleep and you entered the room and took advantage of the situation.' The court heard the victim was in a private room in Jefferson ward at the hospital in Lexden Road and was receiving cancer treatment. She alerted staff after finding Reid in her room and her bag missing, on April 14 this year. Alan Price, named in court as simply 'Alan the mattress man', was making a delivery to Essex County Hospital when the drama unfolded. The 42-year-old father-of three said: 'We heard the cry for help from two of the nurses. 'The adrenaline kicked in and we chased this chap across the road towards the town centre and caught up with him in Crouch Street. 'It was a bit like Rodney and Del Boy coming after him. 'Jamie and I blockaded him and challenged him. 'He was against some railings and we wrestled the bag back.' Hero: Alan 'mattress man' Price with picture he took after he trapped Reid. Mr Price admitted that he and his friend Jamie looked 'a bit like Del and Rodney' from a classic Only Fools and Horses episode as they gave chase . Reid broke free and ran up a nearby street, forcing a motorist to swerved to avoid him. Medical help: Nurse Rachel Minter also chased the thief off the ward to get the handbag back . Mr Price took a picture of the crook before he ran back into Crouch Street. He said: 'I am a keen amateur photographer and had my phone on me. I thought a photograph might be useful. 'I sent the picture to the nurse and she sent it to the police. 'I had no idea it would lead to his arrest within an hour. 'We were in the right place at the right time and just wanted to get the lady's bag back.' The pair work for Talley Medical, which delivers mattresses to hospitals. The handbag, which still contained £200 and personal items, was returned to the patient. Speaking after the hearing, Rachel Minter, ward sister on the hospital's Jefferson ward, said: 'Staff nurse Danielle Woods was looking after this particular patient and she ran past my door with student nurse Gemma Eley. 'They chased after a man who had come onto the ward and had possibly taken a handbag.' Mrs Minter joined the pursuit, along with deliverymen Mr Price and Mr Thompson. Nurse Woods had called the police and officers arrester Reid nearby. Reid claimed he and a friend were taking a short cut through Essex County Hospital and his friend had handed him the bag. Gavin Burrell, mitigating, told the court Reid now realises how bad the incident had been. He had written a letter to the court expressing remorse and sorrow for his actions. Calvin Reid has previously been branded Colchester's most prolific shoplifter and 'a complete social menace'. Chelmsford Crown Court heard his criminal record stretched to 227 offences and he had been given a suspended prison sentence for stealing a Help for Heroes charity tin last year. Six years ago he was banned from every shop in the country. However, an exception was made for his local Tesco so he could still buy food. He was also allowed to go to his nearest pharmacy so he could get his methadone prescription. He was a homeless drug addict at the time. The ban came after he was caught trying to steal a carton of cigarettes from the Co-op supermarket on Abbot's Road, Colchester. A year later he was banned from Colchester town centre indefinitely after clocking up 78 convictions for 188 offences.","Calvin Reid, who had 227 convictions, has been jailed for two years .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A pregnant woman saved her mother's life by standing up to her abusive boyfriend when he was in the middle of battering her with a statue of an elephant. Megan Gleaves, 20, bravely confronted 34-year-old drug user Darren Doran when she was woken up by the sound of him attacking her mother, Fiona Stagg, 39. Doran, Miss Stagg's boyfriend of seven months, launched the unprovoked attack at their home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, on 28 January this year. Beating: Drug addict Darren Doran, left, beat his girlfriend of seven months, Fiona Stagg, right, with the ornament in an unprovoked attack at her home in Barren-in-Furness, Cumbria . Saviour: Megan Gleaves, right, confronted Doran mid-attack and he fled. Her mother Miss Stagg, left, believes her intervention saved her life . He left his victim lying in a pool of blood with a fractured skull - and her injuries could have been much worse had Ms Gleaves not intervened at the crucial moment. Doran was later convicted of wounding with intent, and is serving a six-year prison sentence. Miss Stagg has now spoken about the attack for the first time since the trial in July, in the hope of empowering other domestic violence victims. She said: 'If it wasn't for Megan stepping in and confronting him I wouldn't be here today. She saved my life that night.' Doran fled after Ms Gleaves intervened, leaving her free to call an ambulance for her seriously wounded mother. The pair met in 2013 while both were being treated at a mental health unit in Furness General Hospital, Cumbria. Miss Stagg said the beginning of a relationship was a 'whirlwind romance', but Doran soon began taking her money, disappearing for days - and had even hit her before. Miss Stagg said: 'When he first hit me, earlier in the relationship, I blamed myself, I shouldn't have but I did. Recovery: Miss Staff, pictured above three days after the attack, was severely hurt - and is speaking out about domestic violence in the hope of empowering other women . 'He was a drug user and suffered with mental health issues so I always felt like his carer. 'I would give him money for the gas and electric bills and he would disappear for three days, taking legal highs and drinking alcohol. 'When he would return he would be on a comedown and would take it out on me.' During the trial, at Preston Crown Court, it emerged that Doran has 75 previous offences, including assaulting a previous partner. Miss Stagg added: 'Domestic violence comes in many shapes and sizes and if my pictures can end up helping one person in getting out then it's worth it. 'Domestic violence can be physical, it can be psychological and it can happen to anyone, women or men. 'The abuse has made me a nervous wreck, I struggle to leave the house as I have panic attacks just going to the shops. 'My memory isn't very good since he hit me with the ornament and I can't taste or smell anything. 'Megan and her boyfriend live with me and they give me the courage to carry on. If it wasn't for those two I wouldn't be able to carry on. 'At the moment I am focusing on getting everything that's negative out of my life.' Detective Constable Dan Chadwick, of South Cumbria Public Protection Unit, led an investigation into the attack. He said: 'I am pleased that Doran has been punished for his actions. Domestic violence will not be tolerated in Cumbria - no one should have to live in fear in their own homes. 'I would encourage anyone who has any concerns to get in touch; all reports will be dealt with sensitively and professionally.' Rebecca Rawlings, centre manager at Women's Community Matters in Barrow, said: 'To be hurt in this way by the person you love and the person you believe loves you is terrible. 'This lady has been very brave to share her story and I hope it encourages other women in abusive relationships to seek help.'","Megan Gleaves, 20, saved mother from attack by addict Darren Doran, 34 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A taxi driver who killed a 17-year-old girl while driving down the wrong side of the road had been given a cab licence by the council despite having been banned from driving nine times before. David Baillie, 40, was overtaking a car in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, when he ran down Sarah Burke, 17, who was crossing the road on her way home from college. She was hurled 65ft by the impact, suffered multiple fractures and brain trauma. After five days in hospital she died of her injuries. Mown down: David Baillie, 40, (left) ran down 17-year-old Sarah Burke, right, as she walked home from college in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear . After a trial Baillie was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for seven years. But now Miss Burke's family has taken the council to task for approving his licence despite the   despite his string of previous convictions. It emerged he had been given a Hackney licence by the council just days before the smash. His previous convictions totalled eight for driving while disqualified, two for dangerous driving, 10 for theft of a motor vehicle and five for driving with no insurance. Injuries: Miss Burke, pictured above, suffered serious fractures and brain trauma. She was taken to hospital but died five days later . Miss Burke's parents, Stephen and Theresa, said: 'We are very saddened by the response of Sunderland Council to the issue of taxi licences. 'We think they know they have done wrong but won’t admit it. It would be nice to hear them say that they have made a mistake. 'Baillie has been given chance after chance. Why was this person even on the road? We truly believe that he will do the same again when he gets out.' Miss Burke was mown down by Baillie’s Volvo S60, which swerved and accelerated to get past a Vauxhall Corsa on September 17 last year. He was off duty at the time. Newcastle Crown Court heard the teenager was ‘like a rabbit in the headlights’ when Baillie smashed into her, throwing her into the air before she landed on her head 20m away. Baillie admitted causing death by careless driving, but denied causing Sarah’s death by dangerous driving, but was found guilty by a jury. Sunderland City Council defended itself by saying its regulatory committee was following guidance from central Government. Grieving: Stephen Burke, Sarah's father, has criticised Sunderland City Council for giving Baillie his taxi licence . The Department for Transport only suggests taxi licence applicants be ‘free of driving or motoring convictions for a period of between one to three years’, which would not have covered Baillie's previous convictions, which were all more than a decade old. Mr and Mrs Burke have asked to meet the council's leader, Paul Watson, and are campaigning alongside victim's charity Road Peace to secure tougher sentences. Mr Burke, who wants to see sentences starting from 10 years and driving bans starting on release from jail, said: 'You read about things like this all the time, but until it happens to you, you can’t imagine it. 'It’s just horrific. It’s like we are in this bubble. It’s the likes of us that suffer, law-abiding citizens. We’ve been driving for 50 years between us, not having got a single point and something like this happens, it does seem unfair. 'It won’t bring Sarah back, but there has to be a deterrent. Driving bans start when a prison sentence starts, it’s just not common sense. 'There were many thousands of lives lost like this before this happened to us, and until something is done, there will sadly be many more thousands. 'But it all seems to be falling on deaf ears.' Speaking earlier this month, Sunderland City Council leader Paul Watson defended the decision to issue Baillie’s licence. He said: 'That decision was made in line with Department for Transport advice and guidance that is provided by that department and the government. 'I don’t think we have the authority to look at the issue anyway.' But A DfT spokesman said: 'It is for individual licensing authorities to reach their own decisions both on overall policies and on individual licensing matters.' 'This guidance is intended to assist licensing authorities but it is only guidance and decisions on any matters remain a matter for the authority concerned.'","David Baillie, 40, was overtaking when he ran down Sarah Burke, 17 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A Scottish mother fell ill and died after jetting off for a Mediterranean holiday in a Turkish seaside resort. Lorraine Macmurray, 38, was suddenly struck down with an illness while relaxing with partner Ian Dunn, 48, in Marmaris, not far from the island of Rhodes.

It is unclear how or why Ms Macmurrary's condition deteriorated so suddenly, but the news was met with a wave of tributes from those who knew her. One friend wrote on her Facebook page:'Time for bed after shock news today of Lorraine Macmurray's sad passing. Thoughts are with Ian and family.' Another added: 'I'm shocked to hear you have lost your fight and been taken away far too soon. Sleep tight beside your mum and gran.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The British man who died on an Air Algerie flight which crashed in Mali has been named as maths teacher David Morgan. Mr Morgan, who taught at an international school in Zambia, was one of 116 victims who died when his flight from Burkina Faso to Algeria crashed on Thursday. Tributes to Mr Morgan were posted online today by fellow teachers. One, Andy Vasily, said: 'RIP Dave Morgan. Truly tragic. Prayers to his family and other victims.' Scroll down for video .

Another, South African Hanri de Swardt, said: 'Rest in peace Captian [sic] Dave Masher Morgan. Thanks for all the support and help in Lusaka. You will always be in my thoughts. God bless.' Soldiers today recovered the black box of the plane in the hope of finding out what caused the crash. Terrorism has not been ruled out, though officials say bad weather is the most likely cause. Mr Morgan taught secondary school children at Lusaka International School in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. He is thought to originally be from Liverpool. Teacher: Mr Morgan is thought to have taught at several international schools, with more than 15 years' experience . He worked at the school for two years, and taught his last lesson in June before breaking up for the holidays. Posts on social media suggest he was about to move to Singapore.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A 'psychotic' killer who butchered a mother and son and was freed from Broadmoor hospital after just seven years has uploaded a video of himself sipping expensive whisky and flaunting his watch collection. Gregory Davis, 35, stabbed Dorothy Rogers 31 times, then chased her fleeing son, 19-year-old Michael, to a children's playground and disembowelled him. Davis - who has claimed he thought the world was an unreal game he could only escape by killing - planned the attacks in his diary before carrying them out in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in 2003. Boasting: Gregory Davis, 35, uploaded a video to YouTube showing off his watch - which has been valued at as much as £25,000 . Sipping whisky: Davis was also pictured drinking spirits in the video. He has since tried to mount of a defence of his attacks by emailing the victims' local paper . A court heard that he was gripped by a 'psychotic episode' at the time, and Davis was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility, and was sent to a high-security hospital rather than prison. Davis was released in 2011 leaving the family of his victims disgusted after persuading a mental health tribunal he was well enough to be given a conditional discharge. The conditions were lifted earlier this year and since then Davis has been taking advantage of his new-found freedoms. He posted a video on YouTube showing off a glitzy watch collection and swigging the pricey drink. Victims: Michael Rogers, left, and Dorothy Rogers, right, were both killed by Davis in frenzied and brutal knife attacks in 2003 . In the video, which has now been taken down, he flashes his collection - with one Patek Phillipe thought to be worth around £25,000 and makes a show of drinking the spirit. Davis tried to join a trip to Thailand with luxury watch collectors but they were 'horrified' when security checks revealed Davis's disturbing past. The flashy display has left many wondering where he gets the cash for his ostentatious spending. A former friend of Davis's victims said: 'The thought that Greg Davis is drinking alcohol again and spending thousands indulging his passion for watches is disgusting. Killer: Davis is pictured above in his police mugshot from the time of his sentencing . 'He should never have been freed after such an horrendous crime.' In a lengthy email sent this month to the victims' local newspaper, Davis mounts a 1,600 word defence of the killings, barely pausing to express any remorse for their deaths. He claims he thought the world was a video game emanating from a blue orb on the back of his head, and the only way he could escape this 'unreality' was to commit horrific crimes. He said: 'I thought that nothing was real in the world expect [sic] me and that I had created the world as a game to test myself. 'I believed this information was emanating from a blue orb in the back of my head and I had to do what it was telling me. 'I was convinced through the delusion that I had to be the opposite sort of person to how I had always been in order to break out of the unreality of the world I though I was trapped in. 'Since in my life I had always been a law-abiding, polite and kind person up to that point, I was deluded into believing that I had to do terrible things like killing people.' He adds: 'Of course the terrible acts I committed will never be healed for the victims' families and I live with part of me destroyed by what I did. 'All I can do is try to live as good a life as possible and make a positive difference where I can.'","Killer Gregory Davis, 35, uploaded video of him flashing wealth .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The luxury superyachts of billionaire oligarchs could be seized as part of a squeeze on Vladimir Putin's Russia as international outrage builds over the attack on passenger jet MH17. Foreign policy experts raised the prospect of levying sanctions on the super-rich allies of the Russian president as a way of punishing the country over its links to attack on the passenger jet. Dozens of wealthy businessmen with links to Putin's government are based outside the country, as are their prized yachts, some of which are worth as much as £1billion. Scroll down for video . Billion-pound palace: Roman Abramovich's Eclipse, pictured, is worth as much as £1billion. Super-rich Russians such as Abramovich could be caught up in rounds of sanctions directed against Russia . Second ride: Abramovich also has a second yacht named Luna, worth £105million . Rich-list: Roman Abramovich is worth around £5.4billion . Eclipse, worth £1billion, and Luna, worth £105million, are both the possessions of Chelsea FC owner and super-rich Russia Roman Abramovich. Eclipse, the main vessel, is 535ft long and can hold 34 guests across 18 cabins. It has two swimming pools, a pair of helipads, a nightclub, cinema, theatre, submarine and missile defence system. It is thought to be . Luna, a more humble affair, is just 380ft long, has a single swimming pool and nine cabins which can hold 18. This could make them a target for sanctions by the international community, and they could be impounded by court as a way to 'make life difficult' for those at the top and exert pressure on Russia. Super-wealthy businessmen including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, metals trader Oleg Deripaska and energy magnate Andrey Melnichenko have strong links to the Russian leader and also flaunt their wealth with glamorous ships. 'Ostentatious': Pictured is the Dilbar, owned by Russian business magnate Alisher Usmanov . 'Richest man in Russia': Alisher Usmanov . The Dilbar, 360ft superyacht, is one of the prize possessions of Alisher Usmanov, 60. Valued at around £100million, the vessel has space for 20 guests and features a pool, and hot tub and two helipads . Usmanov has been described by Forbes magazine as 'the wealthiest man in Russia'. He amassed his £11billion fortune from metals trading and his telecoms company Megaphone, which is the second largest mobile carrier in Russia. He also owns a newspaper and a substantial stake in Arsenal football club. Splashing out: Le Grand Bleu, owned by Eugene Shvidler, is another superyacht owned by a Russia billionaire . Features: The huge yacht, pictured moored in Kent, can hold 20 guests, as well as two smaller boats . The vessels could become targets of governments looking to teach Russia a lesson, and become a 'symbolic' way to discipline the country, alongside wider sanctions being considered against the Russian economy. Dr Andrew Foxall, an expert from the Henry Jackson Society think-tank,said there was a 'stronger case than ever' for seizing the ships, which would send a 'symbolic but important message' to Russia. 'The point of these sanctions is to get at the people who enable Putin to act as he is doing - and sanctions are one of the best ways of doing that.' 'It's part of a wider clamping-down on them, their lifestyle they lead in the West while facilitating and enabling Putin to do as he has been doing in eastern Ukraine and Russia. A-team: Andrey Melnichenko is the owner of the above superyacht, named A in honour of his wife . Super-rich: Andrey Melnichenko . A, pictured above on the open seas, is the £200million ship of billionaire Andrey Melnichenko. It is 390ft long, and features a dancefloor with a glass ceiling, which is also the floor of a swimming pool on the floor above. The ship has two other swimming pools as well as a bomb-proof master bedroom and a series of fingerprint security devices to restrict access to parts of the interior. The 42-year-old's personal wealth is estimated at £6.4billion. His fortune was amassed by the founding of a Russian bank, from which he moved into manufacturing pipes and selling coal and fertiliser. 'There's a legitimate argument for looking at their broader lifestyles, and manifestations of ostentatious wealth, like yachts for example.' Putin has been blamed by the West for the attack last week which led to the jet being shot down. It is believed a surface-to-air missile used by pro-Russian rebels brought down the blame, killing all 298 on board. Other experts said that while sanctions on oligarch's yachts would send a strong signal, it could be difficult to enact because governments would need to prove the men were directly linked to the situation. It was also suggested that authorities in ports where oligarchs' tend to moor their prize possessions could be reluctant to seize the ships for fear of scaring off other super-rich holidaymakers. A spokesman for the Open Europe think-tank told MailOnline: 'Dictators like Saddam Hussein and the Gadaffis have had their yachts impounded in the past. 'Sanctions are always a bit of a mixed bag - if you're trying to ostracise a country they can be quite effective. 'For individuals, you can make life very difficult for them - but in this case it's not clear how much influence these people have on Putin and Russia.'","Billionaires with links to Putin's Russia flaunt wealth with huge superyachts .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A hobbyist gardener has spoken of his anguish after finding out the model village he spent decades painstakingly constructing has crumbled and decayed. Alan Teague, 59, started his model village outside his home in the Levenshulme suburb of Manchester as a hobby in 1978. The project, complete with terraced houses, a village bakery and tiny bicycles for the imaginary residents soon became a tourist attraction and hundreds flocked to view it. Sad state: The model village in the Levenshulme suburb of Manchester once drew hundreds of tourists . Overgrown: Since the original architect Alan Teague moved in 1993 his models have not been preserved . Heyday: The village, pictured above in the 1980s, was once carefully tended and ringed with flowers . Shop: The village bakery has its own carefully-painted sign and used to boast miniature cakes in the window . Workmanship: Tiny bikes were once parked outside the bakery, with minute electric bulbs in the rooms . Mr Teague's intricate wonderland, featuring tiny paved pathyways, glass-panelled windows and electric lights, was always left open to curious passers-by and became a firm part of the landscape. But since Mr Teague, a former gardener for Manchester City Council, retired and moved to Devon in 1993, the houses have slumped into decline. Although the first new owner offered to look after the carefully-built homes, successive rounds of inhabitants have not taken care of the houses, which now sit in a sorry state outside the detached property. Mr Teague, 59, from Ilfracombe only realised what a bad state of repair the model properties were in when he went back to Manchester last year. Recalling the visit, he said: 'I was disappointed to see them in such a bad state and even knocked on the door to say hello to the new owner.' 'When I left the houses were in perfect condition. The first person who bought the house wanted to look after them. 'I didn't think about taking them then because they have been part of that area for so long. They're part of Levenshulme's history. I really enjoyed building and having them.' From a distance: Here the village can be seen in perspective in front of Mr Teague's detached former home . Detailed: The rows of terraced houses in Mr Teague's garden were given names, as was the village pub . Intricate: The windows had tiny panes of glass, and paths between the houses were lined with tiny pebbles . Charming: Mr Teague's project began when he was 24, in 1978, and continued for decades . Mr Teague had combined his passions of architecture and horticulture to start the project from drawings back in 1978. Then 24 and already working as a gardener for Manchester City Council after completing an apprenticeship straight from leaving at 16, Alan decided to give himself a project and a hobby and built his own village using sketched blueprints pencilled out in his attic. According to the Skyliner blog by 1988 the project was complete, with intricate details such as tiny glass windows which glowed from the real electric lights. The bakery boasted miniature cakes in the windows and there were flowerbeds, and tiny bicycles leaning against a shop window. One miniature house, a tudor style detached is engraved in the names of Joyce and Sylvia after the names of the mothers of himself and his partner. It was dated 1988 and split into two businesses - one a toy shop and the second a post office and general groceries. It even had its own pub called The Duchess of York, named after a local children's hospital which has since closed and there was a row of terraced houses named York Terrace. Mr Teague said: 'I always liked model villages and architecture and if I was clever I would have liked to have been an architect but I ended up having a lovely career in horticulture. Roofless: The new owner, who declined to comment on the village, has allowed the houses to decay . Careful construction: The thatched roofs of the terraced houses can be seen here in their original form - the tops of the homes are now bare . Playground: Pictured is Mr Teague's niece enjoying the village in an earlier state in the 1970s . Come on in: Mr Teague's nephew, pictured, demonstrates the tiny scale of the properties by posing next to one in the late 1970s . 'I just collected some stones and started my first one in 1978. I did little drawings and did all the woodwork and built on flat stones in the attic then put everything together in the front garden. 'They took about six weeks each. My Dad then wired them all up so each one lit up from a switch in the kitchen and it looked lovely in Winter. 'All the children had grown up with it. There is a school not far from us and everybody used to stop on the way and have a look. It made me feel happy. I have five brothers and two sisters so lots of nieces and nephews who have grown up with it. I did it because I liked seeing other people happy. 'We would have liked to have brought them to Devon but the cost was quite a lot. It's a shame they have fallen into disrepair. If I had lived there I would have repaired them. It was quite the local attraction at the time. It's quite sad to see them as they are now.' Mr Teague met his partner Nigel, a former head gardener at Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden in Manchester, in 1976. They entered into a civil partnership on December 21, 2005 - the day it became legal. 'Makes me want to cry': Levenshulme residents have mourned the decline of the attraction under new owners . The couple's creative streak was reflected in their garden and also that of their new property in Devon which has also become a tourist attraction as a 4-star venue for holidaymakers to the south coast. Mr Teague added: 'Seeing the finished product and watching people enjoying it was the best thing. We both worked with the public so we didn't have a problem with them coming into the garden. 'When I left the houses were in perfect condition. The first person who bought the house wanted to look after them. I didn't think about taking them then because they have been part of that area for so long. They're part of Levenshulme's history. I really enjoyed building and having them.' Lesley Ferguson, 56, a former neighbour, said: 'The miniature houses were lovely and they're part of Levenshulme. I remember them from being little. I used to walk past and look and always wanted to play with them. Two have been demolished since then. 'They were brilliant. Mr Teague always used to keep them well. He would put new roofs on and make sure the windows were ok. As fashions on houses changed he would change the mini ones. 'The people that have them now have really let them go. It makes me want to cry, especially remembering how they used to be. I don't understand. Anyone that has lived around here will know about them. 'They could at least have kept them tidy. If people tried to renovate them I know a lot of people would chip in. Loads of people would love to see them restored to their former glory.' When approached to discuss the houses, the current tenants at the property declined to comment. A man who answered the door said: 'I don't want to talk about it and don't have to reveal my reasons why.'","Intricate model village was built by gardener Alan Teague, 59, in the 1970s .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A close friend of the Duke of Cambridge has been banned from the road for a third time after being found guilty of drink-driving in his £90,000 sports car following a visit to one of his exclusive London nightclubs. Guy Pelly was barred from driving for two and a half years and ordered to pay £7,120 in costs and fines. London's Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that it was the second time Pelly has been banned for drink-driving. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Guy Pelly, pictured today at court, was found guilty of drink-driving at Westminster Magistrates' Court . Supercar: Pelly is pictued above in 2013 with the £90,000 Audi R8, which he was caught drink-driving . Inner circle: Pelly (left) is firm friends with Princes William (centre) and Harry (right). They are pictured above at his wedding in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year . Pelly is close friends with both Prince William and Prince Harry and even organised the Duke of Cambridge's stag do ahead of the Royal Wedding in 2011. They both attended his 'wild' wedding in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, which was preceded by a three-day-long party. Guy Pell's high-class lifestyle has led him into trouble with the law before. It 2001, whuile a student at agricultural college, he was hit with a two-year driving ban for drink-driving. He was also banned for a further 56 days and given a £750 for a speeding offence in 2012. Though it was widely reported that he supplied Prince Harry in 2001 with cannabis when the Royal was 16, no police action was taken. In 2001 he had his licence confiscated for two years after he was pulled over for drink-driving while travelling home to 'student digs' after partying during freshers' week at agricultural college. He was breathalysed and found to have a reading 'in the 90s' of microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - nearly three times the legal limit of 35. Pelly was previously banned from driving for 56 days and fined £750 for speeding in 2012. District Judge John Zani said: 'You have that previous like conviction. I accept that it is now 13 years ago but that was a serious offence. 'I really highlight the period of disqualification for you, then a younger man of good character, and the court then disqualified you for two years. 'Sadly that did not deter you from, years later, when you were stopped in 2013.' He added: 'What you need to bear in mind is that anybody driving a motor vehicle is in possession of a potentially lethal weapon. And when you drive with excess alcohol, or any alcohol, your thought process can be affected.' Pelly was sentenced today after he was pulled over while at the wheel of his Audi R8 GT V10 Coupe in London's Knightsbridge in the early hours of May 28 last year. The 32-year-old initially refused to give a roadside breath test before being taken to Belgravia police station to give a sample on an intoximeter machine. The aristocrat, who recently married Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson at a ceremony attended by Princes William and Harry, was found to have 52 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. Royal favourite: Pelly is pictured here with Princess Eugenie inside Tonteria . During his trial, defence lawyer Philip Lucas called experts who claimed that radiowaves from Pelly's iPhone had interfered with the machine. Mr Lucas, who has represented a string of celebrities facing driving offences including football pundit Ray Wilkins, said police radios may also have affected the intoximeter, making the reading unsafe. But today District Judge Zani ruled that he was entirely satisfied that Pelly was guilty of drink-driving and that the intoximeter machine was working. Pelly, wearing a smart grey suit, white shirt and blue and white polka dot tie, looked relaxed but blushed as he handed his driving licence to the court clerk. During his trial, Pelly, from Pimlico in central London, claimed he had drunk two large glasses of red wine with dinner hours before he was stopped and arrested. Clubbable: Guy Pelly with Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy at the launch of Tonteria . Interior: Tonteria, pictured, is a Mexican-themed club in Sloane Square, central London . But the court heard he told police at the time that he had drunk two beers the day he was pulled over. Pelly said he stopped drinking at around 11pm, climbed into his car and drove to Tonteria, the Sloane Square nightclub he runs, where he spoke to staff and customers before driving off at around 1am. He was pulled over just before 1.10am by police who claimed he had accelerated quickly in the luxury car. But Pelly - who smelt of alcohol, according to officers - refused to give a breath test. He told the court he 'was anxious because I thought that I had drunk near to the limit'. Professor Hugh Makin, an expert witness for the defence, argued that the police station intoximeter which showed Pelly was over the limit could have been faulty. He claimed there was an unusual pause of 125 seconds between the machine recording a baseline reading of zero and it being activated and ready to use. And a software expert told the court that signals from the radios worn by officers in the custody area may have interfered with Pelly's breathalyser reading. Throwback: Pelly is pictured above in 2005 with Prince William leaving Boujis, in South Kensington, after a night out . Old times:  Prince William, left and Pelly, right, watch a Six Nations rugby match together in 2002 . Dr Peter Thrift said radio waves from Pelly's iPhone may have also corrupted the reading. But Judge Zani said there was no evidence that the machine had malfunctioned and Pelly's claims that he did not drink at his bar on the night in question were not credible. He said it was 'curious' that Pelly described the wine he drank as 'house red' - a description usually used in pubs and bars. The judge added: 'Notwithstanding exhaustive expert evidence and lengthy submissions made on his behalf, I am entirely satisfied Mr Pelly has not produced any evidence that raises the realistic possibility that the evidential breath machine in operation at Belgravia police station malfunctioned and produced inaccurate or unreliable readings. 'I am able to state that I am entirely satisfied that Mr Pelly has either deliberately chosen to underplay the amount of alcohol that he consumed in the period of time leading up to his arrest in the early hours of 20 May 2013, or his memory has genuinely failed him.' And he said he was 'entirely satisfied the offence with which Mr Pelly stands charged has been amply proved beyond any reasonable doubt and that he is guilty of the offence of driving with excess alcohol'. Melissa Millin, defending, said Pelly's past drink-driving conviction was a 'stern and stiff' sentence while he was young and naive. She said: 'It is reminiscent of a time when Mr Pelly was attending agricultural college, it was freshers' week, he was driving with a friend, they were going from a bar back to his student digs. 'It was in the '90s, a very high reading at a time when he was younger and foolish. It was a stern and stiff sentence reflecting the high alcohol in the reading, it was probably to teach men like this a lesson.' Pelly, who ran celebrity nightspots Mahiki and Whisky Mist in the past, has been in the Princes' inner circle for years. His grandmother, Monica, was a member of the Tate & Lyle sugar dynasty. He told the court he would pay his £7,120 in fines and costs immediately by card. This included a £2,000 fine, prosecution costs of £5,000 and a £120 victim surcharge. He declined to comment as he left the courtroom today.","Pelly was pulled over in his Audi R8 Coupe last May .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Self-harming': Oscar Pistorius's family has said loneliness led to his ill-advised appearance in a Johannesburg nightclub . Oscar Pistorius's family have said he was involved in an 'unwise' nightclub brawl because of his 'self-harming behaviour' and 'extreme levels of emotional pain'. The South African athlete, 27, was approached in an exclusive Johannesburg club on Saturday and 'aggressively interrogated' about his ongoing murder trial. Pistorius - a double amputee who has competed in the Olympics and Paralympics - was allegedly shoved over during the drunken encounter with racing driver Jared Mortimer at the VIP Room night club. Both men accuse each other of starting the encounter, and a spokesman for Pistorius has denied the incident was a 'bar brawl'. In a statement issued today, Pistorius's uncle Leo called his decision to go out in public 'unwise', and another example of his 'self-harming behaviour'. The athlete stands accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his luxury Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year. His lawyers - who claim the killing was in self-defence - finished their defence at the High Court of South Africa in Pretoria last week, and the case has been adjourned until August 7. In the statement, Leo Pistorius said: 'Oscar is grappling with an extreme level of emotional pain that is manifesting itself in some of his recent unwise actions and choices'. 'Those of us closest to him have been witness to his escalating sense of loneliness and alienation. This, we believe, is underlying some of his self-harming behaviour.' Pistorius's spokesman has previously confirmed the encounter took place and said the athlete 'regrets... inviting unwelcome attention' by appearing in public. She said: 'The individual, according to my client, started to aggressively interrogate him on matters relating to the trial.' 'An argument ensued during which my client asked to be left alone. Oscar soon thereafter left the club with his cousin. Even though Oscar Pistorius could be jailed for life if found guilty of murdering Reeva Steenkamp, there is nothing to stop him drinking and clubbing while on bail. Pistorius was judged not be a 'flight risk' when he was first granted bail for 1million Rand (£54,000) in February 2013. Originally there were conditions stating that he could not drink while on bail and had to be supervised, but after a challenge from his defence team these conditions were dropped and he need only inform police when he wants to leave the country. South African police were said to be probing the incident, but, according to the eNCA news channel, prosecutors are not concerned about the incident as it has 'no bearing' on the murder trial. 'My client regrets the decision to go to a public space and thereby inviting unwelcome attention.' According to Mr Mortimer, however, the athlete – known as the Blade Runner because of his carbon fibre prosthetics – was 'drunk and very aggressive' at the VIP Room night club. He said he prodded Mr Mortimer in the chest while telling him 'you’ll never get the better of me'. Mr Mortimer also told The Star newspaper that the athlete insulted the family of Jacob Zuma, the South African president. Mr Mortimer told a gossip website that he then shoved Pistorius, sending him falling backwards into a chair, which prompted bouncers at club in the exclusive Johannesburg suburb of Sandton, to intervene and break up the row. The incident comes just days after Pistorius’s defence team closed its case in the lengthy murder trial. Pistorius denies deliberately killing Reeva Steenkamp and claims he shot her accidentally after mistaking her for a burglar.  The runner could learn his fate as early as next month. Mr Mortimer told The Juice website he . was introduced to Pistorius by a mutual friend and that the athlete . immediately began talking about the friends who had turned against him, . including Danny Fresco who gave evidence against Pistorius at his . trial. Jared Mortimer, a racing driver, pictured with Nelson Mandela, said Pistorius was 'drunk and very aggressive'. He said he prodded Mr Mortimer in the chest and said 'you'll never get the better of me' VIPs only: The VIP club, situated in the tower pictured in Sandton. According to Mr Mortimer, the duo's altercation happened here . He said: 'He was going on about how . influential his family is and how connected they are. He even pulled out . his phone to show me pictures of armoured cars.' Mr . Mortimer told The Juice that Pistorius poked him in the chest several . times. He said: 'He said you’ll never get the better of me. I’ll always . get the better of you.' During . the trial, the court heard extracts of a psychologist’s report which . found the athlete suffered from post-traumatic stress and severe . depression since the incident. Anneliese Burgess, the spokeswoman for Pistorius, told the Telegraph: 'They sat in a quiet area of the private VIP section when they were approached by the individual. 'The . individual in question, according to our client, started to . aggressively engage him on matters relating to the trial. An argument . ensued during which our client asked to be left alone. The brawl came after the athlete posted a wave of bizarre tweets, including this one in which he attached a collage of . photographs of him helping children with disabilities like his own . Salvation from pain: In another, he posted a photograph of a page from . Victor Frankl's memoir (left), Man's Search for Meaning, in which the Austrian . psychiatrist recounts his time as a prisoner at Auschwitz death camp. He finally posted one asking for God to heal pain (right) 'Oscar left soon thereafter with his . cousin. Our client regrets the decision to go into a public place and . thereby inviting unwelcome attention.' Pistorius has rarely been seen in public since the fatal shooting on Valentine’s Day last year. However, . over the weekend, not only was Pistorius out for a drink with his . cousin, but he also took to his twitter account to share a bizarre mixture of . images and messages with his followers. The series of tweets included photos of him posing with children and a passage from the memoir of an Auschwitz survivor. The . last time he left a message was on February 14th, the first anniversary . of the day he shot dead Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door of his . Pretoria home. In one . of the tweets, he posted a photograph of his finger resting on a page . from Victor Frankl's memoir, Man's Search for Meaning, in which the . Austrian psychiatrist recounts his time as a prisoner at Auschwitz death . camp during the Second World War. The passage included the words: 'The salvation of man is through love and in love. 'I . understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know . bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his . beloved.' In another . tweet, he attached a collage of photographs of him helping children with . disabilities around the passage: 'You have the ability to make a . difference in someones life. 'Sometimes it's the simple things you say or do that can make someone feel better or inspire them.' Finally, . the South African known as 'The Blade Runner' posted a message that . read: 'Lord, today I ask that you bathe those who live in pain in the . river of your healing. Amen.' Pistorius . faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his . law graduate and model girlfriend Miss Steenkamp, whom he shot and . killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year. He . could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder . without premeditation or negligent killing. Additionally, he faces . separate gun-related charges. Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year . Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on July 30 and the defence will do so on August 4. The 27-year-old athlete says he killed Steenkamp by mistake, thinking an intruder was in the toilet and about to attack him. The prosecution says he shot her after a Valentine's Day argument last year. Pistorius . was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the . knee to the ankle. Part of his lower legs were amputated when he was 11 . months old. Last week saw Mr Nel challenge the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability. Mr Nel said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner. The defence maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house. Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a 'forensic report' but disputed Mr Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively.","Amputee sprinter, 27, made 'unwise' nightclub appearance on Saturday .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . They stumble drunkenly through the streets night after night, fuelled by cheap cocktails and in the hope of having the night of their lives. But for many of the revellers in the scandal-hit party resort of Magaluf, their nights will end passed out on a kerb, in a takeaway, or on a stretcher bound for hospital. These pictures, taken this week at the resort on the Spanish island of Majorca, show the sad consequences of the drink-fuelled culture which shocked a nation. Scroll down for video . Drunken: An unfortunate woman can be seen passed out on a kerb in Magaluf, which has been blighted by scandal . Bad end to the night: This woman has no friends to comfort her as she lies face-down on a tiled step in a takeaway on the Spanish island . Collapsed: A man lies sprawled on the pavement next to a Magaluf bar as his friend tries to look after him . One image shows a woman collapsed ingloriously the street as a concerned friend tries to rouse her and other tourists look on. Another, less fortunate woman has seemingly been abandoned in a takeaway, where she has fallen asleep with her face on a tiled step in the centre of the dining area. Elsewhere a man rests on a bench with his head slumped after a night of excess, while others are hoisted onto stretchers by emergency workers cleaning up after another night dominating by the antics of drunken British holidaymakers. The posting on social media of a 21-year-old woman from Northern Ireland performing sex acts on 24 men in succession to win a cheap drink caused a national outcry - but seems to have done nothing to stop tourists flocking there. Indeed, many of those currently partying in the resort say the antics there are just a normal part of life, with some even trying to defend the resort in the face of its bad reputation. Support: Emergency services workers attend to a tourist who has passed out on a bench on the Punta Ballena strip in Magaluf after a night out . Slumped: In this photo a man tries to rouse his friend after what appears to be a heavy night . It comes as even stars of The Only Way Is Essex have distanced themselves from the destination, cancelling an appearance at a party hosted by notorious pub crawl organisers Carnage Magaluf. James 'Arg' Argent and Dan Osborne, who both feature in the hit ITV show, announced they would not be taking part in the event after footage of the incident emerged two weeks ago. Their spokesman said: 'Arg and Dan Osborne won't be going to the pool parties because they started filming a couple of weeks late and are behind schedule. 'Whether they take part in the pool parties in future is something we will look at, but they definitely won't be going on the pub crawl, which is what the public has a problem with.' Rescue: Emergency workers move in a stretcher to tend to one of the night's casualties . TV presenter Jeremy Kyle also fell foul of Magaluf this week when he was pepper-sprayed by a bouncer while trying to film one of the clubs. The nightclub worker said he sprayed Kyle because he 'wasn't showing the good side of Magaluf'. One reveller on the island, 19-year-old Alex Brooks, of New Mills in the Peak District, said: 'I come for the night life, it's literally full of English people so it's just like being at home but abroad and with the sun. Miss Brooks, a student, said: 'I have all my friends with me and we've come after just finishing our exams. 'We saw some people having sex on the beach, in the sea - that's probably the craziest thing I have seen the two times I've been here. 'People just don't give a s*** - they will just stand and have sex in front everyone else. 'Me personally, I wouldn't do that, but if they want to do that fair enough to them. I personally don't think that's right.' Hoisted up: Paramedics take hold of a tourist who has been left in need of medical help by the island's antics . Asked about the many young people that could be seen vomiting and passed out from drinking at the end of the night, Miss Brooks said: 'I think everyone has a point where they do that in their life and they learn from it. 'Whether back home in England or in Amsterdam, Berlin or here in Magaluf. 'For quite a lot of people it's in Magaluf and that's what gives it a bad reputation but it's not as bad as everybody makes out. 'We've seen just two people go off in ambulances and we expected it to just be ambulances the whole night long.' Another tourist, Matt Riddles, 29, from Nottingham, said 'Everyone's out here for a party, things do happen, but that's life. 'Last year I went to Ibiza, it was a great time and wicked, a totally different atmosphere - more grown ups. 'Here it's the younger generation, probably can't handle their drink, but it's been alright.' Scandal hit the already notorious Magaluf seaside resort on the Spanish island of Majorca when a video showing a 21-year-old from County Armagh in Northern Ireland was released on social media. Carnage Magaluf has said it is working with local authorities to make sure the scenes in the footage are not repeated after new regulation was introduced last week. Downmarket: Tourists queue for a takeaway after a night of drinking on the Punta Ballena strip in Magaluf . Outrage: Scandal struck the resort when footage emerged of a 21-year-old girl, pictured, performing sex acts on 24 men in succession in order to win a free drink . The number of holidaymakers looking for hotels in shamed resort Magaluf soared in the aftermath of the town's recent sex and booze scandal, new figures have shown. Last week saw accommodation searches in Magaluf rise 24 per cent compared to the previous week, travel site trivago.co.uk said. The spike in searches for hotel availability between now and the end of August could be down to the recent revelations about the party island. However, travel experts at the site warned that an increase in bookings from youths enticed by the island's unsavoury image could be more than offset by concerned families looking elsewhere. A spokesman said the search figures suggest 'some visitors were dissuaded by events in the media and perhaps the destination could benefit from cleaning up its image.'","Images from resort on Spanish island of Majorca show passed-out Brits .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . This is the moment a seven-year-old survivor of a deadly air strike in a dispute region of Ukraine was miraculously pulled from the rubble of an apartment block. The boy, thought to be called Bogdan, can be seen trapped underneath layers of concrete and metal in the wreckage of a building in Snizhne, eastern Ukraine. Rescue workers crowd round the boy and brace themselves against a huge lump of concrete before it is lifted away by a crane. Scroll down for video . Buried: The boy, who seems to have been given a helmet for protection, was trapped beneath several tonnes of rubble for hours after the air strike . Survivor: The seven-year-old, named as Bogdan, was taken to hospital after the miraculous rescue . Bogdan is then carried away by one of the rescuers, put on a stretcher and carried away in an ambulance. The strike was carried out against pro-Russian rebels, who accused the Ukrainian army of the bombing. Ukraine in turn seemed to blame the strike on Russia. According to the Russian-backed news network Russia Today, the boy was discovered by rescuers in the city, who dug through the debris with shovels to clear a space for him to move. Struggle: Reports told of rescuers and local residents working with shovels and their bare hands to shift debris left by the bombing of an apartment block . Heave: A group of emergency workers and locals brace themselves against a huge slab of concrete before it is lifted away by a crane . Ruin: This apartment block was devastated by a missile strike yesterday morning. A tax office building was also hit . Treatment: Bogdan was carried to a stretcher and taken away to hospital via ambulance . He was then given a torch so he could see, as well as water to drink, ahead of the eventual rescue. The news network said his father was there reassuring him throughout the ordeal. He was trapped under the debris following a bombing at around 6.30am yesterday, when a government building and a block of flats were hit by missiles from a bomber plane, killing at least 11 people. Resident Igor Chernetsov lost his wife in the attack, and said: 'I heard an explosion, and suddenly I was thrown out of the apartment, out of the fourth floor. 'I woke up covered in dust and had no idea what had happened.' Snizhne is in the disputed Donetsk region of Ukraine, which recently voted to secede from the rest of Ukraine by a huge margin - though the central government does not recognise the result and considers the territory its own. Dispute: Rebel forces in Donetsk blame the Ukrainians, who in turn have cast suspicions on Russia . Tensions: The dispute comes as Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk was photographed inspecting military positions in recently-reclaimed Slaviansk . Rebels in the region have been fighting the Ukrainian army for weeks, and accused the government of launching the air strike. Kiev denied rebel charges that the strike had been carried out by a Ukrainian warplane and said it was the work of an 'unknown' plane. As the rebels have no aircraft of their own, response was apparently an accusation against Russia. The rebels have been pushed back in recent weeks after losing the city of Slaviansk early in July. They have now been forced to retreat to the main industrial city of Donetsk, though they also remain in control of the border town of Luhansk. Donetsk, which had a pre-conflict population of about 900,000 people, has been steadily emptying as thousands, fearing a government offensive, have fled. Once a bustling city, there are fewer and fewer people out on the streets and few cars. Most of the banks, shops and bars have closed, cash-dispensers have been switched off and street traffic lights no longer work. Lyudmila, 35, who was leaving Donetsk, said: 'I have been forced to gather up my things and get away from this lawless, genocide, which is happening. I am simply saving my children. My husband is staying behind. I have left my home and my work. I am leaving to save my children.' The fighting between government and rebel forces in Ukraine has claimed hundreds of lives so far. No reliable official death toll exists, but Ukrainian authorities have said that 258 servicemen have been killed in fighting and 922 injured. European Union leaders are considering whether to toughen sanctions against Russia because of what they consider its destabilisation of neighbouring Ukraine. Many of the 28 EU leaders coming into Brussels today agree that Russia is still failing to take sufficient measures to help ease the crisis in eastern Ukraine, where separatists want to break away in two regions. Germany said Ukraine claims heavy weapons are still flowing to separatists across the Russian border and there are increasing attacks on Ukrainian forces from Russian territory. EU diplomats are looking at new sanctions that would go beyond the current travel bans and assets freezes against individuals, but still fall short of full economic and trade sanctions. The U.S. is considering imposing unilateral sanctions on Russia for its actions regarding Ukraine.","Child, named as Bogdan, was buried under debris yesterday morning .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Two men have been charged with robbing the exclusive Dorchester Hotel in a smash-and-grab raid this week. Unemployed brothers Reed Roberts, 23, and Skye Roberts, 19, appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court in London today in the wake of the moped robbery at the five-star hotel. It is the second time in a month the hotel has been raided. In the latest attack a gang of six men on three mopeds pulled up outside  in the early hours of this morning. Three of them then smashed their way through the front door and broke into display cabinets. London's famous Dorchester hotel in Mayfair was hit by its second smash and grab raid in four weeks . Screens were put up at the site on Thursday as workmen moved in to repair damage caused by a gang of six men . Both brothers, from King's Cross, north London, were charged with robbery and possession with intent to supply a Class B drug. They are set to appear at Kingston Crown Court on July 25. Another two men and a woman have been arrested and bailed. The luxury venue was hit in exactly the same way last month, when watches and jewellery were stolen in what police called a 'well-planned' heist. Police have yet to reveal the value of items stolen but it is thought it could run into many thousands of pounds. A guest at the hotel on Park Lane, said: 'I woke up early, so I went down to the lobby at about five, maybe six in the morning. 'There was quite a bit off commotion. Police were there and speaking to the staff and it looked as if a few things had been smashed.' CCTV images from the raid in June show hammer-wielding robbers in motorbike helmets leaving the hotel . During the first raid in June, three of the gang were spotted waiting outside the hotel on their bikes . She added: 'Apparently, one of the doors had been smashed but it was being cleared up and there was a screen around it. 'We . had been told that there was an incident, but nobody was hurt and the . police had it under control. But I spoke to another guest who said the . people who smashed it were driving mopeds, or motorbikes.' A spokeswoman for the hotel said: 'We can confirm there was an incident at the hotel early this morning and we are assisting the authorities with their inquiries. 'The hotel security team were quick to respond and no-one was hurt. The comfort and security of our guests and staff is our top priority.' On June 10, a gang of six men pulled up on three mopeds outside hotel at around 1.30am. On that occasion, they smashed five glass display cases in the foyer and stole watches and jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds. As the gang escaped last month, one of the bikes hit a 25-year-old woman in nearby Cambridge Circus, leaving her with leg injuries that required hospital treatment.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A pair of sharpened metal claws, believed to have been used in ritual combat, has been unearthed by archaeologists in Peru. The artefact, believed to hail from the ancient Moche civilisation, was found in a nobleman's tomb in northern Peru. Experts were digging at the site of the Huaca de la Luna near the city of Trujillo when they uncovered the claws along with a sceptre, earrings and a mask. Vicious: The claws, which were unearthed this week in Peru, are believed to have been part of a costume used in a Moche combat ritual . Sharpened: Historians believe that the claws would have been affixed to an animal skin outfit . Researchers have speculated that the claws, clearly designed for combat, would have been attached to a full-body costume made from animal skin. The weapons would have been involved in a ritual battle between two men, in which the winner was given a pair of the claws as a prize, and the loser was sacrificed to the gods. Commenting on the entire haul, archaeologist Santiago Uceda, told the Peruvican El Comercio newspaper: 'The sceptre signifies power; the earrings, status; and the ceramic piece is typical of an elite personage.' Find: The claws were unearthed at the Huaca de la Luna dig site near Trujillo in northern Peru . Excavation: The artefacts were unearthed from the tomb of a noble, along with a bronze sceptre and a mask . It is believed the find could be more than 1,500 years old. The Moche civilisation, centred around Trujillo, pre-dates the more famous Inca society, and died out for unknown reasons around 800AD. The researchers also found the nobleman's bones in the tomb, and plan to have them examined by experts from the U.S. Further tests and research on the finds are expected to provide a more precise idea of the objects' age, which will be available in around six months' time. The South American Moche civilisation are thought to have emerged around the time of the birth of Christ, and flourished in northern Peru for some 800 years. They were an agriculturally and artistically advanced society, with intricate pottery and jewellery, as well as weapons and armour, numbering among archaeological finds. However, the society appears not to have kept written records, which means information on dates and details of their culture can be difficult to reconstruct. Artistic: The culture is known for artistry and murals, such as this image of a face from the Huaca de la Luna . Especially notable are the huacas, or pyramids, which the Moche people constructed, within which artefacts such as the newly-unearthed claws were found. Two of the towering constructions, Huaca de la Luna and Huaca del Sol, referring to the moon and sun respectively, are decorated with vibrant murals and are now major dig sites. The Moche had an advanced polytheistic religion, and appear to have carried out regular blood sacrifices, possibly to guarantee good weather. Experts have speculated that victims were left to bleed out over a long period of time, with some even suggesting other Moche people drank the victims' blood.","Clawed artefacts found in Turjillo, Peru, hail from Moche civilisation .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Killer: Alison Bowen, 61, hit cyclist Paul Novak at 60mph. She pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving . A drunk grandmother who mowed down and killed a cyclist carried on driving for more than five miles - because she thought she hit a badger. Alison Bowen, 61, had been drinking wine at lunch before she hit Paul Novak, 50, while driving down the A21 in Robertsbridge, Sussex, at 60mph. She collided with the cyclist with with such force that her windscreen shattered. He was carried 50 feet on the bonnet of her Fiat Punto before he was thrown the car and died at the side of the road. She kept driving for another five-and-a-half miles, and only stopped when she crashed into a verge, later telling police she thought she had hit a badger. Bowen has now been jailed for seven years after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving while over the limit alcohol. At a sentencing hearing in Lewes Crown Court, Sussex, Judge Shani Barnes said Bowen made 'the worst decision of her life' in driving drunk. Prosecutor Mary Walford said the grandmother had had three or four glasses of wine with a friend over lunch that afternoon in November. She was at more than double the drink-drive limit but, but said no when a friend's husband offered to drive her home. Witnesses said Bowen appeared to accelerate after hitting Mr Novak. The court heard the impact threw him and his bike off her bonnet seconds later. James Blatcher, a minibus driver who saw the incident, told the court how Bowen was 'driving erratically, drifting towards the middle of the road' after the impact. Members of the public and police who spoke to Bowen when her car finally stopped said she was slurring her words and smelled of alcohol. Wreck: Bowen kept driving for more than five miles after killing Mr Novak, only stopping when she crashed her Fiat Punto (pictured) into a grass verge . The court heard she was hysterical, telling them 'this is not normal for me'. She had cuts on her knuckles from the shattered windscreen glass. Mitigating, Laura Plant said her client could not remember driving away from the crash because she had been in shock. She claimed Bowen was stressed over family matters and was taking anti-depressants at the time. She offered her client's 'most sincere apologies' to Mr Novak's family, including his mother, Ann Novak, who was at court for the sentencing. In a statement read to the court, Mrs Novak described clearing her son's flat in Hastings, East Sussex, after his death. She said: 'It was painfully obvious he had no idea he was not coming home. The kitchen window was open and bacon defrosting on top of the fridge freezer.' Mr Novak was a keen chess player and artist who loved cycling so much he had never learned to drive. Killed: Paul Novak, left, was killed when he was hit by Bowen, right in her police mugshot, at 60mph on the A21 in Robertsbridge, Sussex . His mother added: 'I am finding it very difficult to come to terms with the fact that Paul is no longer here.' After the case Sergeant Dan Pitcher said: 'Paul Novak was the innocent victim of a woman who selfishly decided to drink and then drive home. He had no chance to avoid Bowen or to do anything that could have saved him from her. 'Bowen was so drunk when she struck Mr Novak that she did not even know what she had done. After the collision she must have been able to see next to nothing out of her windscreen and could have easily caused more serious or even fatal accidents. 'This horrific case shows exactly why we cannot and will not tolerate any drink- or drug-driving in Sussex.' Speaking after the sentencing, the victim's mother Mrs Novak added: 'My only son Paul had his life snuffed out in seconds through no fault of his own. 'No sentence will ever be enough to take away the pain I feel that I will not get the chance to spend the rest of my life with him. I still cannot come to terms with the fact that Paul is no longer with us. 'I have been given great support by my family, friends and the police but nothing can prepare you for the death of your child and nothing takes away the sorrow. 'Paul was more relaxed and happy than he had been for years when he was taken from us. I feel robbed that I won't get to enjoy this phase of his life with him - all because of the selfish actions of Alison Bowen.'","Alison Bowen, 61, had at least three glasses of wine with lunch in November .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A £3.25million seafront home belonging to a former neighbour of football manager Harry Redknapp has been destroyed in a fire, killing its owner. Graham Cox, 77, died when the first floor of his home on an exclusive street in Poole, Dorset, was engulfed in flame on Wednesday afternoon. Firefighters battled the flames for several hours but could not save Mr Cox, a retired businessman. Burnt out: The luxurious seafront property in Poole, Dorset, was destroyed in a fire on Wednesday. Harry Redknapp used to live in the grey-roofed house to the left . Killed: Graham Cox, 77, who owned the £3.25million home, was killed in the fire . Rescuers had to wait 24 hours to retrieve his body after the four-bedroom house was left unstable by the blaze. Contractors working nearby had raised the alarm after spotting plumes of white smoke billowing from the roof of the property. The house, which was in need of modernising, was valued at £3.25million because of its sought-after location by Poole harbour. The property is just next to a home which used to be owned by Mr Redknapp, before he moved even further upmarket to the millionaire's Sandbank's estate just across the water. Investigation: Dorset Fire and Rescue have launched a probe into the causes of the fire . Battle: As many as 40 firefighters took on the blaze, and needed to wait 24 hours before entering the unstable house to retrieve Mr Cox's body . Outside: The entrance to the burned-out home can be seen to the left - and Mr Redknapp's old gates to the right . The house, which was in need of modernising, was valued at £3.25million because of its sought-after location in Sandbanks by Poole Harbour . Mr Cox and his wife Elaine, 71, had lived at the house for 33 years. It is thought Mrs Cox was not at the property at the time of the fire. Mr Redknapp and his wife Sandra lived in the luxury property next-door while the soccer boss was in charge of south coast side Portsmouth. Mr Redknapp sold his house for £2.9million  in 2006 and moved to Sandbanks, which has been described as the world's fourth most expensive location after Tokyo, Hong Kong and London's Belgravia. Dorset Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the fire. Former neighbour: Harry Redknapp used to live next door to the property, and now lives in Sandbanks, Dorset, where he is pictured above . Luxury: The Queens Park Rangers manager currently lives on the Sandbanks development, pictured, not far from the flame-stricken house near which he used to live . Relatives of Mr Cox, who is believed to have been unwell when the fire struck, paid tribute to him. In a message posted online, his niece Charlotte said: 'I would like to commend everyone that was involved in the rescue of my uncle in this tragic awful event that will scar my family forever. 'I would like to thank others for their kind words. He was an incredibly hard working man from a very hard working background and this loss will never go away. 'Thank you again to all that risked their lives to help in this truly sad sad accident.' The blaze destroyed the first floor and roof space of the large detached home that may now have to be demolished. Inspector Ian Jarred, from Dorset police, confirmed they were not treating Mr Cox’s death as suspicious.","Exclusive home in Poole, Dorset, caught fire on Wednesday afternoon .

"By . James Leyfield . and Kieran Corcoran . Benefits Street star White Dee is reportedly set to earn £100,000 to appear in the next Celebrity Big Brother. The 42-year-old, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, was rumoured to have been offered the huge payment to appear on the TV show after shooting to notoriety because of her state-funded lifestyle. She had shunned paid media work after finding fame on the Channel 4 welfare dependency documentary, but this week accepted £500 for a TV appearance ahead of the Big Brother rumour emerging. Scroll down for video . Another reality TV role? Benefits Street star White Dee is reportedly set to earn £100,000 to appear in the next Celebrity Big Brother . Welfare queen: White Dee, pictured above in a promotional photo for Channel 4's Benefits Street, has claimed she no longer receives state handouts, as rumours surface that she to take the big-money TV deal . The £100,000, reported in The Sun, is said to be one of the largest offered to a potential guest. Dee herself also seems keen to appear on the show - she has raised the possibility to fans on Twitter, and frequently posts updates about the show. A source told the newspaper: 'Dee will be great on Celebrity Big Brother. She is used to sitting around the house all day long and being paid for it.' However, Dee's agent has denied that any deal has been struck, despite her being 'keen' to appear. The star has hit headline repeatedly for her views on welfare dependency and who should be eligible for state support. This week she revealed that she no longer received benefits, and  admitted the welfare system is far too open to abuse. She had sparked anger by insisting she still deserves handouts while headlining bar crawls in Magaluf and pocketing fees for TV appearances. After reports that the Department of Work and Pensions were investigating her benefits, she revealed on Monday that she is no longer receiving state support. Pay day: According to The Sun newspaper, the 42-year-old - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - will be one of the big earners on the programme's next series and she is already being tipped as a possible winner . Speaking on ITV's This Morning, she explained: 'Maybe it shouldn't be made so comfortable for people on benefits. 'There are genuine people on benefits who do really want to find a job but then there's other people who are so comfortable that they are thinking: ""Well why should I find a job, because I'm perfectly happy living how I am?"" ' Presenter Phillip Schofield then revealed Dee was getting £500 for the 20-minute appearance on the show. The prospect of more lucrative TV work certainly appears close to Dee's heart. Airing her views: Just this week Dee spoke on ITV's This Morning, insisting she is no longer on benefits and admitted the welfare system is far too open to abuse . However, despite the rumour, and Dee's obvious enthusiasm for the programme her agent today denied a deal had been made. Speaking to MailOnline, he said the reports and the figure were 'ridiculous' and that the show would clash with other commitments, including a planned cookery show in France. He said: 'Dee is keen to do Big Brother, but they've got to offer you a place.There are also issues of her health - we're not sure how she would cope in the Big Brother house for days at a time.' Other stars who have been linked to the next Celerity Big Brother, which starts in August, include former TOWIE brunette Lauren Goodger, but she has since denied that she will be taking part in the reality TV series. She was said to have accepted a six-figure deal to star in the Channel 5 reality series, but her spokesman told MailOnline that was completely false. Lauren also took to Twitter to dispel these rumours on Wednesday, writing: 'Just seen a tweet or paper that I've signed up for a show and bringing past in2 it again! Not true once again please leave me out it #nonsense'.","Reality star, real name Deirdre Kelly, became notorious on welfare TV show .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . and Emma Glanfield . Beach lovers and music fans rushed to make the most of the fast-fading sunshine across the country today as Britain braced itself for a wet weekend. Events such as the T in the Park festival in Scotland got off to a bright start today - but with the threat of looming clouds which were set to put a major dampener on the fun in the coming days. Forecasters predicted damp conditions sweeping in throughout Saturday - while commuters in the capital got an early taste of rain with a wet voyage to work. The downpours are set to begin in Northern Ireland this afternoon before rolling across the sea to the north-west of England and western Scotland. Sun-seekers: These bathers decided to catch the last of the warm weather before rain clouds roll in over Britain this weekend . Clouds over sun: Sun-worshippers on upmarket Sandbanks beach in Dorset today relaxed under a foreboding sky ahead of a wet weekend . Crowds: T in the Park revellers made a good start of the festival today, which is due to be headlined by bands including The Arctic Monkeys . Onrush: Spectators were quick off the mark to reach the festival's main stage when the gates were opened this morning . Keen: Young fans (left to right) Laura Bolden, Sophie Herron, Nicole Bradford, Jessica Johnstone and Sophie Gallagher leap for joy in front of a festival logo . Busy weekend ahead: This year will be the festival's last in its current location . By the middle of the weekend they could threaten the rest of the country, with East Anglia and southern England risking thunderstorms on Saturday. London commuters this morning got an early taste of what was to come, as they trudged through the capital in their thousands against incessant showers. Umbrellas held against the skies, the City's workers hurried towards their offices, with no great hopes to weekend sun to cheer their moods. Although many of England's state school pupils are still set to stare gloomily out of their classroom windows for the best part of a fortnight, a host of private school children were set to finish today, joining Scottish children who have been on holiday for weeks. Gareth Harvey, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'Today a lot of places are seeing spells of sunshine, but there's more cloud down in parts of eastern England with some rain towards the south-east at the moment. Threats: Clouds can be seen in the sky behind these festival-goers at T in the Park in Balado, Kinross . Sun for now: Attendees were looking forward to performances from Scottish artists including Biffy Clyro and Calvin Harris . Indomitable: Revellers happily posed for the camera as Scotland's biggest music festival got underway . 'But later . today there's another front that's going to start coming in from the . west, which will introduce some more clouds which will give us bits and . pieces of rain in Northern Ireland. This evening it will start moving to . the west of Scotland. 'Tomorrow . there's rain moving in to northern and western areas, most persistent . in Scotland, while parts of eastern England will experience sharp . showers and developing thunderstorms. 'On . Sunday that rain will sweep its way easterwards overnight. It will . clear most of the country through Sunday morning, except for Scotland . where it will hang on into the afternoon, where it will stay quite wet.' The . rain will be particularly troubling for those north of the border, . where 85,000 revellers at the T in the Park festival faced the uncertain . outlook as they prepared to be regaled by Scottish rockers Biffy Clyro . and DJ Calvin Harris. Flying high: Revellers from St Helens, Merseyside (left) and across Scotland celebrated blue skies this morning - which are not set to last . Happy days: These girls found themselves bathed in some specks of sun today at T in the Park, which are expected to become more scarce as the festival continues . Chilled out: Sunglasses were the order of the day this morning at the festival - but they may not stay that way for long . The . festival in Balado, Kinross, could be blighted by rain as it gets fully . underway. Though revellers were enjoying dry conditions this morning, by . Saturday things were set to take a turn for the worse. On . the festival weather, Mr Harvey said: 'At T in the Park, Saturday will . have a dry start, but probably around noon we'll start to see spells of . rain moving in from the west. 'This . is likely to turn heavy at times in the afternoon. It will stay there . through the evening, through the night, and probably into Sunday morning . as well.' England's . cricketing hopes at Trent Bridge, where the national side is locked in a . test match with India, could also be threatened by the weather. As . the team started today trailing India by more than 400 runs, the . prospect of a shower over the stadium in Nottingham 'could not be ruled . out'. And though the sportsmen looked likely to escape the advancing rains on Saturday - which will probably hit after play finished - the final day of the test match on Sunday risks morning showers before a clearer afternoon. The most extreme weather in the country looked to focus on the South East, where thunderstorms are due to batter areas around East Anglia from the late afternoon through to the evening. Bright start: There were clear skies this morning in Ross-on-Wye, Wales, but showers were expected later on . Threatened: Showers are set to move in from Saturday, dampening the weekend for many . Across the . country disappointing temperatures seemed the order of the day, with . highs of just 26 Celsius expected in areas lucky enough to dodge the . rain. Sunday looked particularly dampened, with national highs of just 22 degrees, amid 'humid' conditions, forecasters said. But despite dampened prospects for the weather in Scotland, revellers seemed in high spirits and prepared to make the most of the music at T in the Park's last year in its current location. Pharrell Williams, Ellie Goulding and . Elbow will play to a daily crowd of 85,000 at the three-day event. The . line-up also includes Paolo Nutini, Ed Sheeran and Jake Bugg. This year marks the end of an era for T in the Park at the Balado airfield, home to the festival for the past 18 years. Organisers . said this weekend's event will act as a 'huge send-off party' before a . move to the Strathallan Castle estate in Perthshire in 2015. Performers . over the weekend include the headliners of T in the Park's first year . at Balado - The Charlatans and Paul Weller - with both acts taking to . the stage 18 years to the day after they performed at the festival's . debut in Kinross. Showers ahead: Commuters walking over London Bridge today had an early taste of the wet weekend to come . Sodden: City workers did what they could to . protect themselves from showers today, while across the country heavy . showers, and even thunderstorms, loomed for the weekend . Gloom: The dampness was set to be shared nationwide, first in the west and north, then more widely . Out and under: These businesswomen (left) sheltered under a single umbrella to escape the rain, while one hardy . worker (right) ignored the inclement conditions and kept up with his . morning run . Gloomy: Tower Bridge was framed by rainclouds this morning as commuters trooped its length on their way to work . The Manic Street Preachers, Kaiser Chiefs and the Pixies will also take to the stage. The campsite gates opened last night, with crowds turning up early to grab the best spot for the festival, now its 21st year. Festival . director Geoff Ellis said: 'This weekend, we mark the end of an era. The Balado site has never looked more beautiful, and we're getting ready . to give our much-loved home for the past 18 years the incredible . send-off it deserves. 'We're really looking forward to celebrating . one last time here with the greatest audience in the world, and can't . wait to welcome you all as we throw Balado a farewell party.' More . than 2,800 artists have played Balado over nearly two decades, including . Foo Fighters, The Stone Roses, Rihanna, The Killers, The Who, Daft . Punk, Kylie Minogue, Oasis, Beyonce and Eminem. Biffy Clyro have played the most times, with their main stage headline set tonight taking their total performances there to 10. It may be an unenviable weekend ahead for many - but overall the British summertime has come up trumps for winegrowers, who could win out over rivals in traditional heartlands like France and Spain. The European countries have been battered by storm winds and hail over the past months, while growers in English regions such as Cornwall and Hertfordshire have boasted of 'perfect' conditions. The onslaught has destroyed up to 80 per cent of some Pinot noir and Chardonnay crops in Burgundy and led one winemakers' association to declare the season 'a catastrophe'. Meanwhile British growers are set to export record numbers of bottles - and demand has never been higher. UK winemaker Sam Lindo will compete this summer against France's top champagne producers for the title of international sparkling winemaker of the year after becoming the first Brit to reach the final three. Perfect conditions: Winemakers in England have been enjoying ideal weather - in contrast to French and Spanish growers. Pictured is the Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin, Cornwall . Sam, who owns Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin, Cornwall, said: 'We've had a brilliant year for our wine. 'If the sun shines, everything flowers and there's no particularly bad weather between now and October, then we could make up to 200,000 bottles. 'On a bad year we can make 50,000. In England we accept that we have bad years from time to time but in Burgundy they'll not be used to having such a bad season. Vineyard . owner Simon Day said English wine used to be considered a joke by . continental rivals but is now good enough to compete globally. He . said: 'English wine used to be a bit of a joke. The French, Italian and . Spaniards - the stereotypical wine-growing countries - would say, ""the English can't make wine"". Growing: The good weather in past months means British winemarkers are hoping to export more than ever . 'Some . of the pictures I've seen of the devastation in Burgundy and France . have been absolutely horrific. Storms can be quite localised and some . vines have been completely stripped bare. 'Obviously . storms and strong winds are something English winegrowers are aware of . too but it's just been the right weather at the right time for our wine. Mr Day runs 16 Ridges Vineyard in Ledbury, Herefordshire, where he hopes to produce 60,000 bottles from this summer's crop.","Bathers on the beach and music fans in Scotland revelled in the fast-vanishing sun today before a wet weekend .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Leading British actress Emma Thompson has slammed Tony Abbott for failing to act on climate change while travelling through the Arctic as part of a Greenpeace campaign. The Golden Globe and Oscar award winner appeared in a photograph on a Greenpeace ship near the Smeerenburg glacier, holding a sign which read: 'Tony Abbott climate change is REAL I'm standing on it!' A second photograph featuring the 55-year-old, saw her holding a second sign with the words: 'Where I stand should be ice'. British actress, Emma Thompson has slammed Australian prime minister Tony Abbot's failure to act on climate change while traveling the Arctic as part of a Greenpeace campaign . The Oscar winner is visiting retreating glaciers in the Arctic alongside her 14-year-old daughter Gaia Romilly Wise (left) The duo are part of a Greenpeace campaign which hopes to draw attention to the impact of climate change . The author and screenwriter is currently travelling around the area on Greenpeace's ship Esperanza with a larger group of people which includes her 14-year-old daughter Gaia Romilly Wise. The team of people are visiting retreating glaciers in the area in the hope of drawing attention to the impacts of climate change, according to Greenpeace's program director Ben Pearson. 'We're told that it is all our fault, global warming — we want the fuel, we want our cars, and that the oil industry is merely responding to the needs of a greedy public,' Ms Thompson said. 'But that's simply not fair. Most of us want to live cleaner lives, but our governments don't make these things easily available. Mr Abbott was not the only world leader that Ms Thompson and the other public figures were calling to action, with Mr Putin and Mr Obama also being asked to help preserve the Arctic . Ms Thompson said from the ship: 'We need governments to stand up to the dirty industries that have for so long funded and controlled them' Celebrities and friends of Ms Thompson including Tom Hanks, Russell Crow, Gwyneth Paltrow and Steven Fry, have all expressed their support for the actress and the campaign over Twitter . 'The changes we need, that the Arctic needs, must come from the top as well as the bottom. We need electric cars to be cheaper and more accessible. We want safer bike lanes in every big city. We want plastic bags to be banned for good. 'We need governments to stand up to the dirty industries that have for so long funded and controlled them, and to give us all an affordable chance to live our lives in a more sustainable way.' Celebrities and friends of Ms Thompson including Tom Hanks, Russell Crow, Gwyneth Paltrow and Steven Fry, have all expressed their support for the actress and the campaign over Twitter. Mr Pearson told Daily Mail Australia that the sign was most likely a joint idea between Ms Thompson and the Greenpeace crew. The 55-year-old (pictured here with her daughter standing) also implored people concerned with climate change to pressure their governments to take action . Greenpeace's project director, Ben Pearson, told Daily Mail Australia that the sign was most likely a joint idea between Ms Thompson and the Greenpeace crew . 'Tony Abbott is leading a government which is the first in the world to actually repeal a carbon price and that's outrageous. We are already seeing the impact of climate change and the dismantling of climate change laws is completely unjustifiable,' Mr Pearson said. 'Emma is expressing the outrage that many people feel about that.' Ms Thompson also called for people concerned about climate change to rally and write to their local leaders 'demanding action'. 'Tony Abbott is leading a government which is the first in the world to actually repeal a carbon price... Emma is expressing the outrage that many people feel about that,' Mr Pearson said .

'Yes, keep recycling; keep using your own shopping bags, taking transit and using your bike. But also use your voice. Know that you have power and you can make your government listen,' she said. 'Above all, I hope that people stop feeling so guilty and powerless about climate change. That's the lie that keeps us paralyzed when really together, we are so much more powerful.' Greenpeace's campaign, which hopes to ban oil drilling and industrial fishing in the Arctic, has attracted more than five million supporters in the last two years.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . River staff in Cambridge are being armed with stab vests amid fears the city's historic punting trade could turn violent. The placid-looking tourist activity, which can earn punt operators hundreds of pounds per hour, has been blighted by an increase in illegal operators and dirty tricks. Unscrupulous punt owners have threatened rivals with knives, smashed holes in rival boats and filled vacant punts with concrete in an attempt to one-up the competition. What lies beneath: Punting on the river Cam may look placid, but tensions around illegal operators are now running so high that river bailiffs are being armed with stab vests . The tense atmosphere surrounding the placid-looking activity has led the Cam Conservators, who maintain the River Cam, to buy in the stab vests to protect their staff as they police the banks. The city council has spent thousands on punt police to patrol the River Cam and clamp down on aggressive touts. Dirty tricks: Punt operators have turned to making violent threats and sinking each other's boats amid fierce competition for tourists' money . But the situation has got steadily worse each year with punts being vandalised to put competition out of business, knife threats, mooring chains being attacked by bolt cutters and even claims of sinking. One woman was left with a broken hip after being knocked as she walked past a brawl between long-standing rivals vying for trade on the quayside. In another incident an angry tout grabbed another by the throat during a stand-off, while another was threatened with a knife after a dispute over a local restaurant got out of hand. On another occasion a punt operator used a chainsaw to sink a rival punt and another time two punts were sunk with gravel and concrete. River bailiffs also have to check boat registrations, tackle illegal moorings and monitor bylaws. Jonathan Wakefield, deputy river manager for Cam Conservators, said: 'There have been reported incidents of assaults on the river and the Conservators took the view they needed to give their staff the option of wearing stab vests. 'If a member of staff feels they would benefit from a stab vest they will be available to them.' Kevin Price, a city councillor, said: 'It's a sign of a sad time when we have got to think about providing such equipment for a guy who is just doing a job. 'It's not welcome, we don't want river bailiffs to have to wear stab vests but there are some unpleasant and aggressive people out there, just because it's leafy Cambridge it's like any other place and there is good and bad stuff going on. There are around 260 punts on the river and a single 12-seat craft can earn £150 an hour. Since mid-2007, 151 crimes with links to punting have been reported, including vandalism and violence. There have been 31 reported clashes between rival touts, including knife threats.","Bailiffs on the river Cam given body armour amid fears of violence .

"By . Lillian Radulova . More than 5000 parents have voiced their opposition to the Productivity Commission's draft report on Childcare and Early Learning, in which recommendations suggest a significant reduction in support funds for middle-income earning families. The Parenthood, a non-profit national parent advocacy group, launched a national video campaign on Tuesday, rebuking the proposals which they claim could force many women out of the workforce. Under the current scheme, the government pays for 50 per cent of a family's early childhood education and care costs, with a cap of $7500 per child per year. Scroll down for video . Advocacy group The Parenthood, have launched a video campaign opposing proposed reforms to government subsidies for childcare . The Productivity Commission's draft report, released one week ago, recommends that the payment be means tested and based on a 'deemed hourly cost'. If passed, it would see families earning $60,000 or less a year have 90 per cent of their childcare costs subsidised by the government, while those earning more would receive a calculated reduced subsid - caped at 30 per cent for families with incomes of $300,000 a year or more. The Parenthood says this means families with an income of $160,000 a year will have their support greatly reduced, greatly affecting their ability to afford basic childcare services. Featuring real mothers, the add argues that the proposed government assistance cuts would greatly limit women's options in the workforce and force many to either leave their jobs or greatly reduce their hours . A survey  they conducted of 1100 parents, found that 75 per cent of respondents 'would stop work or reduce their hours significantly if the rebate was cut'. Their black and white video features real mothers, dressed in 1950s styled clothes and chained to household tasks such as ironing and sweeping, while calling for people to support the 50 per cent childcare rebate. 'If you cut the childcare rebate you take Australia back to the1950s where women had no choice about whether they could go to work or not. Their choice was non‐existent,' Fiona Sugden, the executive director of The Parenthood,  said. The report itself disputes this,  suggesting that the proposed changes would lead the number of mothers in employment to rise: 'by around 2.7 per cent, or 46 700 mothers' 'If you take away a woman's choice to be able to go to work you chain them to the home. The impacts on Australian society will be far-­reaching. 'We will see the return of an army of women kept in the home because the choice for them to be able to re-­enter the paid workforce has been ripped away.' On the contrary, the report suggests that the proposed changes would lead to more opportunity for mothers to enter the workforce, saying: 'the number of mothers in employment is expected to rise by around 2.7 per cent, or 46 700 mothers,' if the recommended changes take place.","Advocacy group, The Parenthood, have launched an add opposing proposed reforms to government subsidies for childcare .
