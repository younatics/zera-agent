"Princess Diana stayed there twice, it's a favourite with the New York Fashion Week set and every American president since Truman has visited the decadent tower building. New York's The Carlyle has been welcoming the world's power players for decades, including John.F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie and reams of kings and queens from Denmark, Greece, Spain and Sweden. Now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to add their names to the hotel's prestigious visitor book, reportedly staying at the classically elegant venue for their three-day trip to the US next weekend. Scroll down for video . Upcoming trip: Kate and Will have reportedly planned to stay at The Carlyle in Manhattan's Upper East Side . Royal retreat: Every American president since Truman and many kings and queens have visited the hotel . From Sunday December 7 to Tuesday December 9 the royal duo have reportedly checked in to the hotel  in the heart of the Manhattan's Upper East Side on Madison Avenue. But rather than presidents and head-of-states, the young couple may have taken their cue to book from rather closer to home, as both Prince William's father and late mother, Diana, have also visited The Carlyle. Princess Diana stayed there in December 1995 when she visited New York for the United Cerebral Palsy’s annual dinner and Prince Charles and Camilla also used the hotel when they stayed in the city  in 2005. High profile guest: Princess Diana arrives at the Carlyle Hotel in New York 24 June 1997 . Landmark: View of 5th Avenue and the hotel's infamous tower from Central Park, New York . It's a wise choice, with fine architectural and a colourful history. Designed by the noted architectural firm Bien & Prince and named in honour of British essayist Thomas Carlyle, the hotel has been a landmark for decades. The 35-storey building, completed in 1930, describes itself as 'a timeless classic' with 188 rooms and suites and sweeping views of Central Park and New York. 'This New York luxury hotel showcases refined taste and creates a true Manhattan experience for sophisticated travellers' says the website. Art Deco: The 35-storey building completed in 1930 describes itself as 'a timeless classic' Sweeping views: Rates range from $675 (£431) for a Superior Room to $15,000 (£9,580) for a Empire Suite . As you might expect, the prices are not exactly rock bottom. They range from $675 (£431) per night for two people in a modest Superior Room with 400sq. ft. of space and either a king or two twin beds, to $15,000 (£9,580) per night for a stay in the Empire Suite, a spacious three-bedroom duplex with 2,600 sq. ft. of living space and a private art collection. While The Mirror reports the Empire Suite is not yet booked out during the royal stay, there's no doubt the young couple will have a more than comfortable time. Miranda Kerr (left), Naomi Campbell (centre) and Stacy Keibler (right) have both stayed at The Carlyle while in New York . All rooms come with Kiehl’s toiletries, bathrobes and 24 hour room service. Recent reviews describe 'elegant white blooms in Art Deco mirrored pots on antique mahogany tables' and 'doormen [who] doff their caps at you as you enter the building'. The hotel's Bemel­mans Bar  attracts art fans keen to see work by Ludwig Bemel­mans, author of the Madeline chil­dren's books - the only commission of his work open to the public anywhere in the world. Starry: Other well known guests of the hotel include Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Victoria Beckham . Wood Allen arrives (left) to play clarinet at Carlyle and (right) Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961 during one stay . Starry guests flock there and regulars include Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Leonardo DiCaprio. As Kate is four months pregnant it's  likely she'll need some down time during the royal visit. Luckily, the Carlyle's spa is more than qualified to cope. They offer massages ($260/£165 for 90 minutes), facials (up to $375/£240), body scrubs, wraps, hammam treatments and waxing. Beautiful sounds: Every Monday Woody Allen plays live clarinet with a jazz band at Cafe Carlyle . Elegant: All rooms come with Kiehl’s toiletries, bathrobes and 24 hour room service . The hotel is also famous for jazz. Every Monday night paying guests (tickets cost from $135/£86) can watch Woody Allen play the clarinet live in the Cafe Carlyle with the the Eddy Davis New Orleans jazz band. The royal visit spans a Monday so who knows, they might be in the mood for a little ragtime rhythm. During their three day stay the Duke and Duchess are leaving 16-month-old Prince George behind as they attend a schedule including a black-tie do, an NBA basketball game and trips to see inner-city youth projects. The trip is expected to be Kate’s last overseas visit until she gives birth to the couple’s second child in April. However, William is expected to carry out a solo visit to China early next year to strengthen Britain’s relationship with the country. A royal spokesman declined to comment this morning on where the Duke and Duchess are staying in New York.","Duke and Duchess reportedly planned to stay there during upcoming US visit .

"It could be the perfect excuse for lying in on Monday morning. Getting up for work after the clocks go forward can be bad for your health, according to scientists. A team from the University of Alabama were studying the impact of daylight saving on a person's health. Monday morning blues: Professor Martin Young said clocks going forward could raise your heart attack risk . They found that the abrupt change to a person's daily schedule increased the risk of having a heart attack by 10 per cent. This impact isn't felt on the Sunday morning as most people adapt their weekend schedule and rise a little later. However, the risk peaks on Monday when workers have to get up at a set time to get to the office. When the clocks go back in October the risk of heart attack decreases by 10 per cent. 'Exactly why this happens is not known but there are several theories,' said Professor Martin Young. 'Sleep deprivation, the body's circadian clock and immune responses all can come into play when considering reasons that changing the time by an hour can be detrimental to someone's health.' Wake up 30 minutes earlier on Saturday and Sunday than you need to in preparation for the early start on Monday . Eat a decent-sized breakfast . Go outside in the sunlight in the early morning . Exercise in the mornings over the weekend . Everyone in America will need to prepare to lose an hour this Sunday as clocks move forward on March 11. However Britons . have longer to prepare as summertime starts two weeks later in the UK . with clocks moving forward in the early hours of March 25. Professor Young said night owls would need to take particular care as they have a more difficult time with 'springing forward.' He added: 'People who are sleep-deprived weigh more and are at an increased risk of developing diabetes or heart disease. Sleep deprivation also can alter other body processes, including inflammatory response, which can contribute to a heart attack.' Time changes also affect the body's circadian rhythm, which 'stresses' the body cells as they struggle to adjust. Professor Young said: 'The internal clocks in each cell can . prepare it for stress or a stimulus. When time moves forward, cell . clocks are anticipating another hour to sleep that they won't get, and . the negative impact of the stress worsens; it has a much more . detrimental effect on the body.' He added that the immune system can also receive a knock as immune cells also have internal clocks. He pointed to animal studies that found mice given a certain level of toxin died if they had been subjected to a 'daylight savings time' effect, but survived if their routine was not changed. It can take a few days to synch your circadian rhythm to a changing environment . Everyone eventually synchs with their environment however Professor Young says you can ease yourself into Monday morning by waking up half an hour earlier than normal on the weekend before and catch some sunlight in the morning. 'Doing this will help reset both the central, or master, clock in the brain that reacts to changes in light/dark cycles, and the peripheral clocks - the ones everywhere else, including the one in the heart - that react to food intake and physical activity. 'This will enable your body to naturally synch with the change in the environment, which may lessen your chance of adverse health issues on Monday,' he said. While the study uncovered an association between lost sleep and heart risks, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.","'Abrupt' change to daily schedule increases risk of heart attack by 10% .

"Pictures from more than 60 years of the Miss World competition show how much fashion and beauty has changed since the first show in 1951. The finalists in this year's pageant gathered for a photocall in London this morning to vie for the 2014 crown of Miss World. But while contestants are often accused of being identikit models, these pictures show the difference between the first winners with their demure post-war glamour and the glitzy gowns of contestants in more recent years. Scroll down for video . Miss World 2014 finalists gathered for a photocall in London this morning. The beauty pageant has changed a lot since it launched 63 years ago . The 1950s lady traditionally showed much less flesh than your average 21st century woman. But even in the first Miss World, the contestants had to show off their figures in the swimwear round. In fact, the event was first organised in 1951 as an all-singing, all-dancing advert for beachwear called The Festival Bikini Contest, but the press referred to it as Miss World and the name stuck. The competition winner - Kiki Hakansson from Sweden - was crowned in a bikini at the Lyceum Theatre in London. Several countries with strong religious links threatened to pull out of the pageant in protest and the swimwear round was scrapped for several years. It means that Kiki is the only winner to have ever been crowned while wearing a bikini. Old school glamour as seen on Miss World 1953 Denise Perrier has made way for spray tans and straightened locks, as seen on Miss World 2006 Tatana Kucharova from the Czech Republic . The first Miss World Kiki Hakansson from Sweden was crowned in a bikini at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1951 . Since then, the contest has since been staged all over the world. The trends have ranged from the big eyes and winged eyeliner of the 60s, to the giant hair and shoulder pads of the 80s. In the 90s, the winners' outfits morphed into the glitter-heavy gowns that the competition is now famous for, while contestants from the noughties are notable for their slim frames and lack of first winner Kiki’s hour-glass figure.

"Wealthy families from the Middle East are buying up London's luxury homes in the wake of the area's instability and now make up a tenth of all buyers in the exclusive Mayfair area. In recent years, Middle Eastern governments and sovereign funds have ploughed their vast resources into the capital, buying development sites and high-value buildings, according to research by a Mayfair property firm. They have spent  £4.4billion since 2006 and now control nine of central London's largest development sites, equating to 28,000 new homes. The super-rich have also bought prime residential properties in Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Kensington, Belgravia and Regent's Park - so much so that half of all buyers of Mayfair property worth more than £10million are from the Gulf. Plush: Cambridge House, London - one of the upmarket properties being marketed at wealthy buyers from the Middle East. Wealthy families from the Middle-East are buying up London's luxury homes and make up half of all buyers on Mayfair property priced above £10million, according to estate agents Wetheralls . The Lancasters, close to London's Hyde Park. Since the upheavals of the Arab Spring many Gulf leaders come to London more frequently for business and socialising . Property firm Wetherell Estates surveyed all property sales last year in Mayfair and said a tenth of all homes were bought by Gulf investors - rising to 50 per cent for those worth more than £10million. The Abu Dhabi Royal family, the Al Nahyans, are now the largest landowner in Mayfair after the Duke of Westminster. Their portfolio includes the £400million Berkeley Square Estate, purchased in 2001, which consists of the square and surrounding buildings. Abu Dhabi is also funding the £200million conversion of the former U.S. Naval Headquarters in Grosvenor Square which will be redeveloped into luxury apartments and penthouses. The State of Qatar is another massive investor in Mayfair with the Al-Thani family buying a £200million mansion on Park Lane in 2006. An exclusive property in Knightsbridge. The influx of oil-based wealth began in the early 1970s when the Saudis started to buy property in west London . Cambridge House is a grade I listed mansion on the northern side of Piccadilly. It will be worth an estimated £250million after refurbishment . Plush: A property in Charles Street in Westminster. Those from the Middle East have spent a staggering £4.4billion since 2006 and now control nine of central London's largest development sites, equating to 28,000 new homes . The Deputy Prime Minister of Qatar owns the £180million Lombard House mansion on Curzon Street whilst state backed funds bought the £500 million American Embassy which is to be converted into a luxury hotel. Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'Every time there has been economic or political upheaval in the Middle East, it has generated a new wave of Middle East purchasers and investors into Mayfair and the wider West End. 'Prime Central London is viewed as an island of stability, with Mayfair the top location due to its role as the base for many Gulf region embassies and other diplomatic quarters.' The influx of oil-based wealth began in the early 1970s when the Saudis started to buy property in and around Mayfair. The fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 was a wake up call to the other Gulf monarchies that they needed an international portfolio of homes to provide security and overseas assets. And during the first Gulf War (1990 to 1991), there was an an influx of Kuwait and Saudi investment into the London property market. Mr Wetherell added: 'The biggest change in the last few years has been the shift in wealthy Middle East residents choosing to live in London for large amounts of the year, rather than just in the Summer months. 'Since the upheavals of the 'Arab Spring' many Gulf leaders and business people now come to London far more frequently for business and socialising. 'They also choose to base family members - grandparents, aunts and uncles and student offspring - in London for long periods for safety, education and shopping.'

"Bill Cosby has been accused of leaking a story about his daughter's battle with drink and drugs - to kill a story about him 'swinging with Sammy Davis Jr and some showgirls in Las Vegas'. The comedian is said to have told a tabloid newspaper about his 23-year-old daughter Erinn's problems in 1989 after being asked to comment about the 'swinging' allegation. It is the latest controversy to hit the 77-year-old and comes after a number of women came forward in the last month with assault allegations against the TV star. Scroll down for video . Bill Cosby (pictured) is said to have told a tabloid newspaper about his 23-year-old daughter Erinn's problems in 1989 after being asked to comment about 'swinging' allegations . The comedian is said to have told a tabloid newspaper about his 23-year-old daughter Erinn's problems in 1989 after being asked to comment about the 'swinging' allegation. Erinn Cosby is pictured above . According to Page Six, the National Enquirer approached Cosby 25 years ago asking for a comment about claims surrounding him and Sammy Davis Jr. But instead, it is claimed, he told the newspaper about his daughter's drug and alcohol abuse - and was then quoted in the story saying: 'Deep down inside, she knows we love her'. Page Six reporter Richard Johnson says he was given the information from a journalist who worked at the National Enquirer at the time and quotes his source as saying: 'My editor told me that daddy Cosby was the source. He ratted out his flesh and blood.' Cosby has yet to respond to requests for a comment, Page Six reports. Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions. Cosby has been accused of leaking the story to kill another story about him 'swinging' with Sammy Davis Jr (pictured) 'and some showgirls in Las Vegas' Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, also claimed that Cosby tried to attack her during a gathering at his house in 1967. The comedian has never been charged and his lawyers have said the assault claims were discredited. Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer has branded the stories 'completely illogical' and added that the claims are 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity'. In a statement released on Friday, he said: 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity. 'These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.' Cosby himself has refused to respond to 'innuendo'. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel  (pictured right) said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner. Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties. Michelle Hurd: The 47-year-old actress, best known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. In a Facebook post this weekend, she described being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things became too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, ""No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened'''. Joyce Emmons: The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault. Lachele Covington: The 20-year-old actress, who’d been an extra on the TV show Cosby, filed a police report in March 2000 against the star, accusing him of making an unwelcome sexual advance. According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed.","TV star accused of leaking story about his daughter Erinn's battle with drugs and alcohol .

"She gave up a high-flying career in international finance when she married the Netherland's King Willem-Alexander in 2002 but it seems Queen Maxima hasn't entirely forgotten her roots. The Dutch Queen, 43, is in Beijing for a four-day visit and joined high-level bankers for a meeting at the headquarters of the Bank of China. She was there to represent the UN in her role of Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance - a job she was handed in 2009 by Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon. High-powered: Maxima met bankers at the Bank of China during a four-day visit to Beijing . Role: The royal was in Beijing on behalf of the UN and in her role as an advisor on financial inclusion . Maxima, who is also the Honorary Patron of the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, has been tasked with raising awareness of the benefits of financial systems that also help the poor. In practice, this means improving access to savings, insurance and credit, all of which are particularly important in countries where famine and rising food prices can hit the poorest hard and, in the worst cases, lead to starvation and malnutrition. Access to credit and savings also gives business a boost, and allows small farmers and entrepreneurs in poor countries to strike out on their own and move past subsistence. China, despite being considered one of the world's financial powerhouses, remains a country where the gap between rich and poor remains stark, with many country-dwellers finding it difficult to access finance. That, however, is something Maxima and Bank of China president Zhou Xiaochuan hope to change and the reason for the high-level talks taking place today and over the next three. Meeting: Maxima also posed for pictures with the President of the Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan . Important: The UN is hoping to boost poorer people's access to financial services . Boost: Those who have access to credit and savings accounts can launch their own businesses . Maxima herself is no stranger to the Far East having recently completed a tour of Japan and South Korea with her husband Willem-Alexander, 47. Since returning, the royal has endured a tough few weeks after her father Jorge Zorreguieta was hospitalised in her native Argentina after being diagnosed with leukaemia. Mr Zorreguieta, 86, is a former politician who served as Agriculture Minister during the murderous rule of General Jorge Rafael Videla. In addition to widespread human rights abuses, Videla's regime was also responsible for the 1982 attack on the Falkland Islands, which saw British troops deployed to the South Atlantic where they swiftly booted out Videla's forces. As a result of his links to Videla's government, Mr Zorreguieta was asked not to attend Queen Maxima's 2002 wedding, with his wife María del Carmen Cerruti Carricart also choosing to stay away.

"Some higher learning institutions that have received small donations from education-loving Bill Cosby over the years have backed away from the entertainer amid a growing sex abuse scandal, but the schools to which he's donated millions are staying mum. Cosby's record of big donations to colleges and other institutions has been a key part of his rosy public image. He's handed millions to Spelman College, Morehouse and a handful of others who've hinted at no change to their relationship with the star. But even his generosity can't stand completely apart from the rising tide of allegations made by women accusing him of sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Staying mum: As schools that have received smaller donations from Bill Cosby back away from the entertainer amid growing sexual assault allegations, recipients of multi-million donations like Atlanta's Spelman College--which got $20 million from the actor in 1988--remain silent. Here, Cosby speaks with Spelman College president Dr. Beverly Tatum in 2006 . There have been no discussions about any changes surrounding Cosby's gift to Spelman, the woman's college in Georgia, according to Audrey Arthur, spokeswoman for Spelman . A North Carolina school, High Point University, removed the 77-year-old entertainer from its National Board of Advisors, a panel that includes retired Gen. Colin Powell. The university referred to Cosby as 'one of the most influential performers of our time' when it announced his appointment last July. The Berklee College of Music said in a statement Monday that it is 'no longer awarding an online scholarship in Mr. Cosby's name. The college has no further comment at this time.' More telling would be a decision by an institution to publicly renounce any of the tens of millions of dollars that he and his wife, Camille, have given over the years, or rejection of a new donation. Neither has occurred. Cosby's legacy of giving is decades-old and extensive, and includes: . $20 million gift to Spelman College in 1988 . $3 million to the Morehouse School of Medicine . $1 million in 2004 to the U.S. National Slavery Museum in Fredericksburg, Virginia . $2 million from Cosby's wife, Camille, to St. Frances Academy in Baltimore in 2005 . 'I don't want to belittle the implications of the accusations, but nothing has been proven and he has not been charged,' said Michael Chatman, a philanthropy expert and founder of a speakers' bureau on the field. Recipients of Cosby largesse are likely to adopt a wait-and-see attitude because of that, he said. If there was to be a verdict in a criminal or civil case, 'I think you would see a devastating effect in terms of his philanthropic and charitable legacy,' Chatman said. It's unlikely an institution would return a donation, he said, but new recipients could be expected to carefully weigh the implications of accepting money. There was no response from Cosby's publicist to a request for comment. His attorney, Martin Singer, has called the growing number of sexual assault allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited' and accused the media of vilifying the actor and comedian once known as 'America's dad' for his role as a loving patriarch on the hit sitcom 'The Cosby Show.' Cosby's legacy of giving is decades-old and extensive, topped by a $20 million gift to Spelman College in 1988 and including, among many other donations, $3 million to the Morehouse School of Medicine; $1 million in 2004 to the U.S. National Slavery Museum in Fredericksburg, Virginia; and $2 million from Cosby's wife, Camille, to St. Frances Academy in Baltimore in 2005. According to Internal Revenue Service filings, more than $800,000 in scholarship grants were given through the William and Camille Cosby Foundation from July 2000 to June 2013. Earlier this month, the Cosbys loaned works from their extensive collection of African-American art to the Smithsonian Institution for an exhibit.

Playing favorites: Temple University said Bill Cosby remains a trustee of the Philadelphia institution, a position he's held since 1982. He's considered its most famous alum and has often spoken at commencement, drawing huge cheers . There have been no discussions about any changes surrounding Cosby's gift to Spelman, the woman's college in Georgia, according to Audrey Arthur, spokeswoman for Spelman. At the time, it was the largest donation ever by a black donor to a historically black college, which later established an academic center named for Camille Cosby and an endowed professorship for visiting scholars in Bill Cosby's name. A recent report on donations to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where Cosby received his doctorate, indicates Bill and Camille Cosby have given the school between $250,000 and $499,999. Cosby also did a benefit performance in 2004 that raised $1.5 million for Amherst, and last year was named an honorary co-chair of the school's $300 million fundraising campaign. Cosby's status with the campaign has not changed, the university said. Temple University said Bill Cosby remains a trustee of the Philadelphia institution, a position he's held since 1982. He's considered its most famous alum and has often spoken at commencement, drawing huge cheers. A Temple spokesman confirmed the campus has no buildings named for Cosby but does offer a $3,000 science scholarship named for Cosby and his wife. He declined further comment on Cosby's philanthropy. In 2006, Cosby settled a lawsuit filed by a former Temple employee who alleged he drugged and fondled her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion. Cosby was represented by Patrick O'Connor, chairman of Temple's board of trustees. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel  (pictured right) said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner. Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties. Michelle Hurd: The 47-year-old actress, best known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. In a Facebook post this weekend, she described being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things became too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, ""No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened'''. Joyce Emmons: The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault. Lachele Covington: The 20-year-old actress, who’d been an extra on the TV show Cosby, filed a police report in March 2000 against the star, accusing him of making an unwelcome sexual advance. According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed.","The black women's college in Atlanta has a building bearing wife Camille Cosby's name and is not among the schools pulling support from Bill .

"President Barack Obama is returning Tuesday to the city where he says he first forged his ties to the Latino community to pitch his new executive actions on immigration, on a day when a suburb of St. Louis is recovering from massive overnight riots 300 miles away. The president's decision to give an expected lengthy speech in the Windy City after devoting just nine minutes Monday night to calling for calm in Ferguson, Missouri, will open him up to criticism that he's both insensitive and politically tone deaf. He said Monday night in response to a single question he took from a reporter at the White House that no decision has been made about whether he will visit Ferguson personally. But his interest in barnstorming to generate interest in his immigration policy obsession comes as a new poll shows a large majority of likely U.S. voters believe he's wrong. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama took off for Chicago a day after a Ferguson, Missouri grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown . NOT JUST MISSOURI: Chicago protesters came out in large numbers on Monday night, underscoring that the city's Democratic base may be more interested in the Michael Brown case than in immigration reform . Obama, the onetime community organizer, is trying to seize the advantage in the heated dispute over the contentious issue while Congress is on a Thanksgiving recess and Republicans scramble to coalesce behind a unified opposition strategy. The Rasmussen poll released Monday afternoon and lost in the overwhelming news coverage of the Ferguson riots found that 62 per cent oppose Obama's decision to grant legal amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants without approval from Congress. Just 26 per cent are in favor of Obama's plan. After years of claiming he couldn't act unilaterally to enact immigration reform because of the U.S. Constitution's emphasis on a separation of executive and legislative powers, Obama declared last week that he had the legal authority to do so on a temporary basis. Only 24 per cent of those who spoke to Rasmussen's pollsters agree. Fifty-seven per cent said he was right the first time, deciding that he not have the legal right to implement his plan. Worse for the White House, 55 per cent told Rasmussen that Congress should challenge Obama's executive actions in court. The president spoke Chicago community leaders, part of an ongoing effort to defend and promote his decision to bypass Congress and direct sweeping executive actions that could spare millions of immigrants illegally in the United States from being deported. His plan also threatens to open the employment floodgates as those temporarily 'legal' immigrants win eligibility for work authorization cards. MailOnline reviewed polling data that indicates Americans are even more upset about the prospect of losing jobs to illegal immigrants at a time when the overall U.S. labor participation rate is its lowest since 1978. Obama said Monday night that a presidential visit to Ferguson is still an open question. 'Let’s take a look and see how things are going,' the president said Monday night at the White House. [Attorney General] Eric Holder has been there. We've had a whole team from the Justice Department there, and I think that they have done some very good work.' Obama will speak in Chicago at a center in the city's predominantly Polish-American far northwest side, underscoring how his immigration measures would affect more than Latino immigrants. Chicago has the largest population of Poles in the United States. Under a series of measures Obama announced last week, nearly 5 million immigrants will be eligible to avoid deportation and sign up for work permits. The number who could benefit represents about 45 percent of the total number of immigrants who either entered the country illegally or have overstayed their visas. Republicans have vowed to rein Obama in, but have not fallen behind any specific plan. SEEYA: Obama will dodge controversy by speaking 300 miles away from Ferguson . Rioters set police cars like this one ablaze on Monday night after a grand jury declined to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown . SIGNS OF THE TIMES: The Ferguson protests came the Obama's doorstep last night as activists with pre-printed signs converged on the White House shortly after the president delivered brief remarks . Chicago is Obama's hometown – he worked in the city as a community organizer in the 1980s – and its metropolitan area has the fifth largest Latino population in the country. Obama is expected to highlight what the White House says are the economic advantages of his executive decision and to counter Republican criticism that his measures exceed his authority. The Chicago visit is his second trip out of Washington to draw attention to his actions since he announced them Thursday. Last Friday, the president spoke in Las Vegas, another city with a large Latino population. Obama has a mixed history in Chicago over the question of immigration. He conceded in his 2006 book 'The Audacity of Hope' that his experiences there led him to reflect on the meaning of citizenship and 'my sometimes conflicted feelings about all the changes that are taking place.' In 2006, when he was a senator from Illinois, he denied a request from about 30 Mexican nationals living in Chicago for a special piece of legislation that would protect them from deportation. The decision infuriated immigration activists in the city. But Obama has also backed an overhaul of immigration law, and while he initially angered advocacy groups by delaying his executive actions until after this month's midterm elections, last week's measures have generally been greeted with enthusiasm from immigration advocates and Latino groups.","Trip was scheduled before chaos took over streets of St. Louis suburb .

"Cornelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez told police he knelt on his seven-month-old son's chest before the boy died . A 23-year-old Las Vegas father told police he knelt on his seven-month-old son's chest before the boy died last week because he was angry the baby was being 'fussy' even after being fed. Cornelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez was being held Monday at the Clark County jail pending a court appearance on a murder by child abuse charge in the death of his son, Raymond. The 255-pound Rodriguez-Gonzalez was arrested November 18 after initially telling the boy's mother, Amy Elliott, that the child had fallen while she was at work. A police report says authorities found bruises on the child's face and hip, scrapes on the back of his head, partially healed rib injuries and a lacerated liver was that was believed to have led to his death. Rodriguez-Gonzalez was watching Raymond and his two stepsons on the day of the incident while their mother was at work, reports Review Journal. On her lunch break, Elliot called Rodriguez-Gonzalez and the pair argued about care of Raymond. While still talking to Elliott, Rodriguez-Gonzalez went to check on the baby, only to find that Raymond was not breathing. Elliot told Rodriguez-Gonzalez to call 911 - the baby was taken to University Medical Center. Rodriguez-Gonzalez said he would take the other children to a friend’s house and meet her at the hospital, but he disappeared. Raymond died at the hospital from his devastating injuries. Two days later, Rodriguez-Gonzalez turned himself in to police and confessed to kneeling on Raymond, according to the report. Elliot told Rodriguez-Gonzalez to call 911, and the Clark County fire department arrived and took Raymond to University Medical Center (pictured). Raymond died at the hospital from his injuries .","Cornelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez, 23, charged with one count of murder .

"Irish star Sinead O'Connor has hit back at those who have questioned the integrity of the new version of Do They Know It’s Christmas? - which aims to raise millions of pounds to help fight the ebola crisis in West Africa. Celebrities such as Lily Allen and Emile Sande - who was one of the performers on the single - were joined by MPs and charities in a backlash against the latest Band Aid single, claiming it ‘patronises’ Africa. Some say the lyrics are outdated and perpetuate negative stereotypes of African countries which could harm their world image. Scroll down for video . O'Connor, 47, has robustly defended the number one Band Aid single from its detractors . Lily Allen (left) and Emeli Sande are the latest musicians to criticise the song, which aims to raise millions of pounds to help fight the ebola crisis in West Africa . But O'Connor, 47, has robustly defended the number one single from its detractors. O’Connor told the Daily Telegraph: 'I think everyone should shut the f*** up. 'If you didn't like the lyrics you shouldn't have agreed to sing the song. 'I think it's smug of Lily Allen to say it's smug.' She added that there is a common impression that performers have not donated any of their own money to the cause, something she calls an 'assumption'. Miss Sande, who was one of only three black musicians to take part in the new single, praised the sentiment behind the project but said ‘a whole new’ song was needed. The 27-year-old, who has Zambian heritage, said on Twitter both she and Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo ‘made and sang our own edits’, and it was ‘unfortunate’ none made the cut. She added: ‘I apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence. I wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control.’ Lily Allen also said yesterday she refused to take part in the project because she felt there was ‘something smug about it’. She added: ‘I prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that.’ Blur frontman Damon Albarn also appeared to criticise the project, saying ‘really sometimes, giving money creates another problem’. He added: ‘Our perspective and our idea of what helps and our idea [of] what’s wrong and right are not necessarily shared by other cultures.’ Stellar line-up: Band Aid 30 artists have recorded a new version of the song Do They Know It's Christmas? Sinead O'Connor pictured centre with hat . Damon Albarn (left) appeared to criticise the project and Sir Malcolm Bruce MP told BBC Radio 4: ‘Africa isn’t a country' No go: Adele 'ignored' Bob Geldof's pleas to sing on the Band Aid 30 Christmas charity single . Fuse ODG says he pulled out of recording the Band Aid 30 charity single because he feels it's a quick fix to a larger problem. He also criticised some of the lyrics . The single, which features stars including One Direction, U2 frontman Bono and Ellie Goulding, was originally released in 1984 to raise money to fight famine in Ethiopia. Critics said it was inappropriate to use the same song – brought to public attention once more by its original creators, Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure – for a different crisis. It has also been pointed out that many of those affected by ebola are Muslim and do not celebrate Christmas. Others complained the song’s revised lyrics, which include the line ‘there’s death in every tear’, paint Africa in a negative light. Sir Malcolm Bruce MP, chairman of the International Development Select Committee and deputy Lib Dem leader, told BBC Radio 4: ‘Africa isn’t a country, it’s a continent with many different countries with many different challenges. Sir Bob Geldof, 63, (pictured with Midge Ure) has called claims the song is patronising a ‘complete load of b*******’ ‘There’s a danger that this kind of appeal is slightly patronising and gives the impression that Africa doesn’t have the capacity to do things for itself.’ Solome Lemma, co-founder of Africans in the Diaspora and the Africa Responds initiative on ebola, told Al Jazeera the original song ‘created misconceptions about Ethiopia in a patronising way’. And Dawit Gebreselassie, 26, a financial analyst from Ethiopia, joked: ‘I would ask, does Geldof know when it’s Christmas time in Ethiopia? ‘Perhaps the fact that we celebrate Christmas a few weeks later on January 7 could have misled him into thinking we don’t know when it is. ‘Reassure him from us that, after his last three reminders, we are well aware and don’t need any more prompting.’ Despite the backlash, the single has sold 312,000 copies since its release last week. Sir Bob, 63, has called claims the song is patronising a ‘complete load of b*******’.","Irish singer, who performs on single, blasts those who malign single .

"Parts of the UK are becoming no-go areas for police because minority communities are operating their own justice systems, according to the Chief Inspector of Constabulary. The rise in ‘community justice’ means crimes as serious as murder and sexual abuse are going unreported – a situation reminiscent of Belfast in the height of the Troubles. Tom Winsor said police officers were simply never called to some neighbourhoods, where law-abiding people rather than criminals administer their own form of justice . Honour killings, genital mutilation, and domestic violence are some of the offences thought to be unreported . He said: ‘There are some communities born under other skies who will not involve the police at all. I am reluctant to name the communities in question, but there are communities from other cultures who would prefer to police themselves. ‘There are cities in the Midlands where the police never go because they are never called. They never hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own. ‘It’s not that the police are afraid to go into these areas or don’t want to go into those areas,’ he said. ‘But if the police don’t get calls for help then, of course, they won’t know what’s going on.’ Honour killings, domestic violence, sexual abuse of children and female genital mutilations are some of the offences that are believed to be unreported in some cities. Last December, three members of a self-styled ‘Muslim Patrol’ vigilante group were jailed for harassing, intimidating and assaulting people in East London while claiming they were enforcing sharia law. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor warns police officers are never called to some areas . In an interview with The Times, Mr Winsor said: ‘It could be anything. [Honour killings] are the most extreme case. That is murder. There is no honour in it.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the rising number of unreported crimes was a damning indictment of our police. He told the Mail last night: ‘Directly elected police commissioners are an attempt to give people a direct say over the way people are policed. Elsewhere the administering of justice often is ineffective and there is a great deal of incompetence in the system. ‘People don’t feel they can count on their police. Instead of placing blame with ethnic minorities, we should ask what it is that is wrong with the criminal justice system.’ Although Mr Winsor did not specifically refer to any ethnic group, there have been growing concerns over the emergence of sharia courts in some Muslim communities. Senior police officers said they disagreed with the description given by Mr Winsor, who became chief inspector in October 2012. He is the first person from a non-police background to hold the post. But Chris Sims, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, said: ‘I don’t know if he’s talking about Birmingham, but I have only had one conversation with him since he took office and it wasn’t about this. ‘His characterisation of these communities as born under other skies is just wrong. Many members of communities in Birmingham are British-born and I find that a very odd expression.’ Mr Winsor insisted that public trust in the police needed to be restored for a functioning justice system. He said the police ‘are not a paramilitary force – they are citizens in uniform’. A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain said: ‘We all rely on the police to protect our communities and this can be only done through full co-operation and partnership. ‘Co-operation is particularly important for Muslim communities who have experienced a rise in Islamophobic hate crimes.’","Rise in 'community justice' in Midlands cutting number of police calls .

He said McCulloch said he was willing to meet with the family to which McSpadden screamed: 'I do want to meet with him right now. What do you mean no indictment?!' Sobbing she ran from the room, with her husband chasing after her. Crump said the family still has hope that a federal civil rights investigation will hold the officer and the police department accountable.

"ABC News' George Stephanopoulos landed the highly-prized first television interview with Officer Darren Wilson who broke his silence to defend shooting Michael Brown. Wilson sat down with the 'Good Morning America' co-host, less than 24 hours after a grand jury decided not to indict the 28-year-old officer in the death of  Brown this summer. In a preview on Tuesday, Stephanopoulos told viewers that he spent more than an hour with Wilson in a 'secret location.' In television terms, the Wilson interview was one of the biggest 'wins' of the year -  the officers's low-profile since the shooting means every media organization covering the high-profile story was eager to speak to him. Officer Darren Wilson (pictured) has broken his silence and given his first television interview to ABC after a TV battle for his first appearance . ABC News' George Stephanopoulos landed the first television interview with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, speaking to him for an hour Wednesday in Missouri . Stephanopoulos tweeted a photo of the interview which showed Wilson sitting at a table wearing an open-necked blue shirt . The network interrupted its afternoon programming on Wednesday for Stephanopoulos to talk about the interview. He said Wilson told him that he is 'sorry' for the death of the 18-year-old, but that he would not do 'anything differently'. 'He says he did what he was trained to do. He has a clean conscience over his actions that day,' Stephanopoulos said. NBC's Matt Lauer (left) and CNN's Anderson Cooper (right) were among a high profile TV anchors who spoke in secret with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, but did not secure interview . Stephanopoulos tweeted a photo of the interview which showed Wilson sitting at a table wearing an open-necked blue shirt. Next to the photo the This Week host wrote: 'Just finished a more than hourlong interview with Officer Darren Wilson. No question off limits.' It is unclear if ABC paid for the interview - CNN'S Brian Stelter tweeted: 'TV nets sometimes find $$$ ways to 'win' exclusive interviews. But not Darren Wilson: ABCer says 'No payment, no licensing, no NOTHING.' CNN'S Anderson Cooper is doing his show from Ferguson as is NBC'S Brian Williams. ABC News plans to feature portions of the discussion on 'World News Tonight,' ''Nightline' and 'Good Morning America' and promised to post the full interview on its website. Speaking on his CNN Sunday morning show Reliable Sources, host Brian Stelter revealed that five anchors had all had off-the-record conversations with the police officer and that his list was not exhaustive. Within hours of his name being linked with having secret meetings with Darren Ferguson, Anderson Cooper tweeted to confirm that it had happened and was standard procedure . CNN host Don Lemon also tweeted to confirm that he had met with Darren Wilson to sound him out for a possible exclusive TV interview . 'My sense from my sources is that it's mostly the anchors doing the talking in these off-the-record meetings, it's mostly Darren Wilson listening and getting to know the person, said Stelter. Soon after the program aired on Sunday, both Cooper and Lemon confirmed via Twitter that the meetings had taken place. Another TV anchors who met with Wilson was CNN's Don Lemon . Both were keen to explain that such meetings are a normal part of the TV guest booking process in order to establish trust and comfort with the potential interviewee. 'For the record, I met briefly with Darren Wilson a few days ago to see if he wanted to do an interview with me. That's standard procedure,' Cooper wrote. Cooper denied that his meeting with Wilson was part of a pro-police conspiratorially and pointed out that he'd repeatedly interviewed Michael Brown's family members and their attorneys. 'I'd also like to interview the grand jury,' Cooper wrote. ' 'There is no conspiracy here. Reporters want to interview people and sometimes you have to meet them first.' He added that Wilson had chosen 'not to do an interview with me.' Cooper, on Twitter, drew a comparison to another man in the news that many journalists wanted to interview earlier this year: disgraced Los Angeles Clippers team owner Donald Sterling. 'Prior to interviewing Donald Sterling, for example, I also met with him to ask him to do an interview. That's how you ask for an interview,' Cooper wrote. Separately, Lemon wrote on Twitter that his meeting with Wilson was 'not out of the ordinary,' and that 'We've interviewed the Brown family, Dorian Johnson and all witnesses. Of course we'd want to interview Wilson.'

"The jury in the murder trial of an Iowa teenager heard on Wednesday a disturbing 911 call in which the 13-year-old suspect admitted to killing his own mother after a failed attempt to rape her. Crooks, who is now 14, was charged with first-degree murder and assault with intent to commit sexual abuse in the March 24, 2012, slaying of his mother, 37-year-old Gretchen Crooks. In the 911 recording made on the night of the murder at the family's Osage home, Noah Crooks could be heard telling dispatcher Barb Michael: 'I’m not joking at all. She’s dead. I’m scared. I killed my mom with my .22. I don’t know why I did it.' Killer: Noah Crooks, left, allegedly shot his mother Gretchen, right, multiple times in her Iowa home and then called police . During the conversation, which lasted about 10 minutes, the boy repeated his confession several times The Global Gazette reported. 'I feel crazy and I know I'm not. I . think I have some form of ADD,' Crooks told the 911 operator. 'I tried . to rape her. I tried to rape her but I couldn't do it. 'Who tries to rape their own mom? My life is down the drain now.' As Michael placed a call to deputies . and sent an ambulance to the Crooks' home, Noah told him that his weapon . is empty and appeared concerned that the officers might shoot him. 'I just wish it was a dream so I could wake up and I could kiss her and hug her,' then-13-year-old Crooks said. Noah rambled on about his mother . making him homemade doughnuts earlier that night and expressed disbelief . that he killed her after she did that for him. He then revealed that Gretchen Crooks had taken away his 'Call of Duty' video game because he got bad grades in . school, and that is when he snapped. 'Something just came over me,' he told the dispatcher. Weapon: A motive for the shooting has yet to be reported while the victim's husband, pictured, had a penchant for guns according to his Facebook page . The boy droned on about having to move . away and giving up on his dreams of getting into a good college and . marrying his eighth-grade girlfriend. On the first day of Crooks' trial . Wednesday, jurors also heard testimony from Mitchell County Sheriff’s . Deputies Jeff Huftalin and Greg Halbach, who described the crime scene . at 3599 Cameo Avenue, WCF Courier reported. Gretchen Crooks' bullet-riddled body . was found stretched out on a coach. Her pajama top was undone and she . was naked from the waist down, Halbach said in court. The woman was not . breathing. The deputies seized the murder weapon, a .22 caliber rifle, which was lying across a chair in the dining room. Halbach said that he slapped handcuffs . on Noah's wrists and placed him in the patrol car. He added that the . teenage suspect was not crying and did not appear emotional. Noah Crooks' attorney is not denying . that his client killed his mother, but he claims that the boy suffered . what he referred to as a 'tumor of rage, ‘rendering him insane at the . time of the slaying . Addressing the jury panel, the lawyer . said that a child psychiatrist will testify that Crooks suffers from . intermittent explosive disorder - a mental illness marked by repeated . episodes of impulsive, aggressive or violent behavior. Child's play: Noah revealed that his mother had taken away his 'Call of Duty' video game because he got bad grades in school, and that is when he snapped . On Friday, Noah's father, William Crooks, 41, testified that on the day of his wife's murder, he was at a going-away party for his boss when he got a text message from his son that read: 'Dad this is Noah. I killed Mom accidentally, I egret it. Come home now please.' Crooks was certain that his son was kidding and responded in kind: 'OK. Just throw her in the grove. We'll take care of her later.' About 20 minutes later, a sheriff's deputy called Mr Crooks and told him that he needed to come home because an accident had taken place. Crooks pulled up to the house at around 8.20pm on March 24. In court Friday, he described the scene inside his home as 'chaos.' The father explained o the jury that his was was the disciplinarian in the family, and had a stormy but loving relationship with their son. Mr Crooks added that the mother and son would fight often, but later make up and play games together. She was the one who bought the .22 caliber Ruger as a present for Noah in 2010 when he was about 11 years old. The father said that his son did once say that he wanted to kill his mother, but he didn't take the threat seriously. There was no history of domestic abuse or criminal records associated with any Crooks family members. On March 24, 2012, Crooks is believed to have fired a .22 caliber at his mother at their rural home. The teen was said to be calm and emotionless when he called 911 reporting the shooting. Home: Police reported the teenager as sounding calm on the phone though perhaps in shock by what had just happened . 'The emotions of the young man, from . what I've been told, is his demeanor was very calm and kind of stoic. Almost like he was in shock also,' Deputy Greg Beaver told KTTC at the time. Mitchell . County Sheriff Curt Younker told the DesMoines Register: 'We’re at a . loss. These are good people, very responsible. It is the most . heartbreaking thing I’ve ever seen.' 'We have lost our daughter. We have lost . our grandson,' Mrs Crooks' mother Beverly Brahm of Mason City told the . Albert Lea Tribune. Mrs Crooks, who was listed with her husband William Crooks as the rural Osage property owners, had worked as a nurse at Mercy Medical Center-North Iowa while also studying toward her master's degree after accepted at the University of Iowa in 2009. On her Facebook page back in 2010, she praised her son, one of two sons according to Mrs Brahm, for his musical talents on the saxophone as well as his accomplishment in being accepted into a University of Iowa camp to learn Chinese. 'So proud of him!' she wrote. She had also recently published an application on her page reading: 'Click ""like"" if you love your son!' Mrs Crooks' death comes as the first reported murder in the city of Osage since 1898, according to KAAL-TV. Praise: The mother had praised her son on her Facebook page for his acceptance into a Chinese language camp at the University of Iowa as well as his playing of the saxophone . Arrest: The 13-year-old was taken into custody without incident and taken to the North Iowa Juvenile Detention Center where charges have not yet been filed . Speaking of her daughter with pride, . her mother, whom she relishes knowing she was able to say 'I love you' to . earlier in the day of her passing, described the 37-year-old as . studying 'full time, while she was working full time,' according to the . Courier. Wanting to make a difference wherever . she could, Mrs Crooks previously served among a team of doctors and . nurses who traveled to provide medical relief to the Hurricane Katrina . and Rita victims in the Gulf in 2005. Serving as a critical care nurse, she cared for patients in a makeshift hospital. William . Crooks' Facebook page shows his interest in the US Concealed Carry . association as well as the Springfield Armory, a company that sells . pistols and rifles. 'Gretchen was a great nurse and leader. We, as members of her Mercy . family, continue to mourn for her and will be holding a memorial . service. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family and friends.'

"A rare Nazi bling-ring once owned by Adolf Hitler is going up for auction in Maryland next week and is expected to fetch at least £70,000. The 'Hitler Ring' is made of silver and was . originally plated with gold, though not much is left after 75 . years. On the ring is a huge swastika that is supported by other . swastikas and swords. The piece is crowned by a large ruby and mounted . in a silver globe which rests on an elaborate foot, also with a swastika. The ring was made for Adolf Hitler by fanatical Nazi goldsmith Karl Berthold . Set on an elaborate base and inside a silver ball, the ring is made from solid silver and topped with a huge ruby. Whether the dictator ever wore the kitschy item is unknown, but the fact that is was made for him will be enough to drive prices sky high for collectors of Nazi militaria when bidding begins next week. Though an official certificate shows it was made for Hitler, we have no way of knowing if he wore it . It is being offered for sale by the Alexander Historical Auctions House in Maryland and comes with documents come with it testifying that it was made for the Fuhrer. The ring was crafted by the master goldsmith Karl Berthold who was a fanatical Nazi and kicked Jewish craftsmen out of his business in Frankfurt shortly after the regime came to power in 1933 - long before laws forbidding them from working came into place. He wrote to Hitler saying he had fired the ""Bolshevik-Jew servants"" and was commissioned by a party functionary to make the ring for the Nazi leader. The ring was found at Berchtesgaden, Hitler's mountain retreat in Bavaria, in 1945 by American troops. One of the soldiers pocketed it as a souvenir before selling it on. It was owned by several collectors over the years, the last of whom died two years ago and whose grandson is now selling it. The Alexander Historical Auctions House is famous for selling Nazi-themed militaria and artefacts. Three years ago it sold the diaries of Auschwitz 'Angel of Death' Josef Mengele - the camp doctor who performed terrible medical experiments on inmates - that he kept while on the run in Brazil. Another more common kind of Nazi ring is the so-called 'death's head ring' awarded by Heinrich Himmler, the chief engineer of the Holocaust, to officers he considered particularly loyal or courageous. One such ring was auctioned at Northamptonshire-based JP Humbert Auctioneers in 2008. It had been signed by Himmler (pictured right) himself and was dated to commemorate the Night of the Long Knives, when Hitler purged a section of his own paramilitary which he considered to be challenging his authority. A second death ring was stolen from a museum in Berchtesgaden in 2005 and was thought to be worth between four and 40 thousand pounds. The theft prompted a Europe-wide warning from police to collectors to protect their items after Hitler's own gold Nazi party badge was stolen just a few weeks earlier.","The ring is made of silver, was originally plated in gold, and bears a huge swastika picked out with rubies .

"A third of Britons would refuse to let their elderly parents move in with them if they needed full-time care, a report revealed yesterday. But soaring numbers are choosing to take in a lodger – as long as they are willing to pay for it. According to the research, just 28 per cent of adults would be happy for ageing parents to come and live with them if they needed 24-hour support. Asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home, responses included ‘sad, guilty, concerned or emotional’ But the overwhelming majority would not be so welcoming, with a third (32 per cent) saying they ‘would not let their parents move in’ and just over a third (36 per cent) admitting they ‘would have to seriously think about it’. However when asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home, responses included ‘sad, guilty, concerned or emotional’. The report, by care home provider Care UK, touches on one of the biggest social problems facing Britain – the future of pensioners at a time when many are living longer than ever before. As long as old parents are healthy and do not want to move in with their offspring, then all is well . Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of centenarians in the UK has increased by more than 70 per cent over the past ten years, taking it to a record 13,350. Meanwhile, the number of home-owners renting out a room to a lodger has almost doubled over the past five years, according to a separate report from financial services firm LV. The report said around 715,000 home-owners currently have a lodger, compared to just 369,600 in 2009. In a sign of the financial pressure facing many Britons, the most common reason was ‘to help with the bills’, followed by boosting their savings and having more disposable income. However unlike lodgers – who pay on average £3,000 in rent a year – many people’s elderly parents are ill, in need of care and are short of cash to pay for it. Dr Ros Altmann, a leading old age expert, said she was ‘astonished’ that such a small proportion of children are prepared to have their elderly parents living with them. She said: ‘Family help should surely be give and take – not just one way. ‘Of course it is possible they feel their homes are not big enough to house their parents. There is so much loneliness among older people in this country and part of it seems to stem from more families living further apart. In other countries, there does seem to be a greater degree of concern for older family members.’ Around 2,000 people in the UK – whose parents are older than 60 – took part in the investigation about their willingness for their elderly relatives to live with them if they needed to. Of those who said they wouldn’t let their parents move in, half said it was because their home was too small. Four in ten said they ‘would not be able to cope’, while one in five said they lack the ‘necessary skills to look after their parents’. Common conditions among the elderly in need of care include dementia, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, heart disease or a general lack of mobility. And the problem of care looks set to worsen over the coming decades. For example, the Alzheimer’s Society predicts the number of over-60s with Alzheimer’s and related conditions could more than double from 800,000 to two million by 2050, putting huge pressure on both the NHS and social services. Maizie Mears-Owen, from Care UK, said: ‘The thought of moving parents into a care home can come with great concern. ‘Often the decision is made at crisis point when parents need a level of care which families may not be able to provide.’","Just 28% of adults would be happy for ageing parents to live with them if they needed 24-hour support .

"Michael Brown's family 'strenuously object' to the grand jury decision, their attorney said at a press conference just hours after it emerged that Darren Wilson will not be charged for killing their son. Attorney Benjamin Crump slammed St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch's announcement and the lawmakers' lack of thoroughness during the press conference on Tuesday. The teenager's father, Mike Brown Sr., stood beside Crump and the Reverend Al Sharpton as they called for justice and for the implementation of the Michael Brown Law. The law calls for every police officer across the country to wear a body camera so that citizens can see how confrontations with authorities unfold. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Michael Brown Sr, pictured at a press conference on Tuesday,  is calling for all police officers across the country to wear body cameras. He did not speak but his attorney spoke on his behalf . Sadness: Michael Brown Sr is pictured left as Crump speaks at the press conference on Tuesday . Angry: Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Michael Brown's family, spoke out on Tuesday and said they 'strenuously object' to the grand jury's decision and to the process that allowed them to reach it . Speaking on Tuesday, Crump said that he and the family went through all of the information that was released by the prosecutors on Monday 'and saw how completely unfair this process was'. He demanded to know why more questions weren't asked of Wilson. 'A first year law student would have done a better job of cross examining,' he said. 'When was his veracity ever challenged? When was his credibility ever challenged?... No one held up the pictures and said, but that's not consistent with the physical evidence?' Crump said that he believed the 'symbiotic relationship' between the police and the prosecutors meant that Wilson was never properly questioned. 'This process is broken,' he said. 'We could foresee what the outcome was going to be and that's what occurred last night.' Devastated: Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband and friends outside Ferguson police department following the announcement . Although she wore sunglasses, tears ran down her face as she heard the decision . The victim's stepfather (center) screamed 'Burn this b**** down' as he stood next to Brown's mother . He called for prosecutors to appoint people with no relationships to the people involved in cases so that people can believe in the system. In addition, he called for the implementation of the Michael Brown Law. 'This system is so unfair to the citizens,' he added. 'We ask that everybody join us in demanding change and making a difference for the lives of our children.' Rev. Al Sharpton, who also attended the press conference, said that they were determined to fight for justice for the teenager. 'This is not our first rodeo, McCulloch,' he said in comments directed at the prosecutor. 'We will deal with this in the way civil leaders act.' Ahead of the grand jury decision on Monday, Michael Brown Sr. released a statement, which called for peace as well as four-and-a-half minutes of silence after the announcement. Killed: Michael Brown, left, was shot dead in broad daylight by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who is pictured right a day after the killing in August.

Decision: St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch is pictured on Monday as he announces the grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson . 'We are not here to be violent,' he said. 'We are here in memory of our son. We are here for protection of all children. We are here to support justice and equality for all people. 'We lift our voices to ensure black and brown men, women, and children can live in this country without being devalued because of the color of our skin.' After the decision was announced on Monday night, Michael Brown's family reacted with raw emotion outside the Ferguson police department. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband. She wore a button pinned to her chest that read 'Indict Now and a white hat with a photo of her son which called for 'Justice for Mike Brown', the New York Times reported. 'They wrong!' she yelled, pointing toward the police station. 'You all know, you're all wrong!' Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face.

She then buried her face in her the chest of the victim's stepfather, Louis Head, who wore a t-shirt reading: 'I am Mike Brown.' He turned around to the incensed crowd and screamed: 'Burn this b**** down'. As the roaring crowd began to surge forward, the pair were both whisked away by supporters. McSpadden had found out the news in a hotel room where she waited with her family and their attorney and also ran from the room crying, her attorney said. Crump said the family still has hope that a federal civil rights investigation will hold the officer and the police department accountable. They will also consider filing a civil wrongful death lawsuit, he said.

The family released a statement immediately after the news via their lawyers which read: 'We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions. 'While we understand that many others share our pain, we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change. 'We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen...

"Christopher Columbus and his discovery of the Americas in 1492 is one of the great stories of modern history. But five centuries after his momentous achievement, a British explorer wants to prove that Columbus was actually beaten to it by another seafaring nation 1,000 years earlier. Philip Beale believes the ancient Phoenicians - a Semitic civilization that prospered between 1500BC and 300BC on the Mediterranean coast - sailed to the Americas first. Explorer Philip Beale, left, wants to prove that the ancient civilisation the Phoenicians discovered America before Christopher Columbus in 1492, right . Mr Beale built The Phoenician in 2008 exactly as it would have been 2,600 years ago . And the former City fund manager from . Lulworth, Dorset, wants to prove it by sailing a replica boat he built . exactly as it would have been 2,600 years ago across the Atlantic. 'It . is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done . it [before Columbus], it was the Phoenicians,' Beale told CNN. 'Of . all the ancient civilizations they were the greatest seafarers -- . Lebanon had cedar trees perfect for building strong boats, they were the . first to use iron nails, and they had knowledge of astrology and . currents.' The Phoenician covered more than 20,000 miles when Mr Beale sailed it around Africa in 2008 . The theory that . an Israelite race discovered the Americas before Columbus was popular in . the 18th and 19th centuries after several ancient inscriptions were . found in North America which were said to be Hebrew. But many historians still doubt that the Phoenicians were capable of such a treacherous journey. Mr . Beale has already been on an epic voyage in his 50 tonne wooden vessel - . aptly named The Phoenician - after he sailed it around Africa in 2010. Traveller: Steve Coogan (centre) as Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days with Cecile de France and Jackie Chan . Phileas Fogg is a fictional character who is the star of the 1873 Jules Verne novel 'Around the World in Eighty Days.' In the book, which has been made into several films - including one starring Steve Coogan (above) - Fogg attempts to circumnavigate the world in eighty days, or less, for a wager of £20,000 with members of his London club. He vows to return to the club by 8.45pm on Saturday 21 December 1872. He is followed by a detective named Fix during his journey who suspects him of robbing the Bank of England. While in India Fogg meets Aouda, a widowed princess, and saves her from being burned to death during her husband's funeral. She then travels with Fogg for the rest of his journey. She and Fogg eventually fall in love and marry. Fogg arrives home thinking he has lost his bet - but he eventually finds out that he won. He . hired archaeologists and traditional shipwrights to construct the boat . based on the design of an ancient galley found wrecked in the western . Mediterranean. It is almost 65ft in length, with a single sail and emergency oar holes for when the wind dropped. Then, like a modern-day Phileas Fogg, . he set sail in it to prove that the fabled voyage was possible using . only the power of the wind and the tide. He . wanted to demonstrate that the Phoenicians - referred to in the Bible . as 'rulers of the sea' - had the capability to circumnavigate the . continent 2,000 years before the first recorded European which was . Bartolomeu Dias in 1488. Setting sail from Syria in 2008, he covered 20,000 miles over two years, battling everything from six-metre waves off the Cape of Good Hope to Somali pirates. And now he is willing to do it all again, provided he can raise the £100,000 he needs for the trip. The odyssey is expected to take two to three months, setting sail from Tunisia and arriving in America via the Atlantic Ocean. He has also been invited by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art to be . part of the museum's landmark exhibition on the Phoenician civilisation, . opening in September 2014. 'The conventional wisdom . is that Christopher Columbus discovered America. But anyone who looks a . little closer will see the Vikings were there around 900AD. They've . found Viking settlements in Newfoundland, it's undisputed,' Beale told CNN. 'So Columbus was . definitely second -- at best. I put forward the theory that the . Phoenicians could have been first and I hope to prove that was the . case.'","Former City fund manager Philip Beale built replica Phoenician vessel .

"Antonio Smith, 9, was fatally shot in Chicago on Wednesday, after he left from his house while upset over not getting a cupcake . A 9-year-old boy has been fatally shot on Chicago's South Side, after he ran away from home while upset over not getting a cupcake. Antonio Smith's mother, Brandi Murry, said Antonio had called her at work earlier on Wednesday asking about a treat, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. She told the 9-year-old she would be home soon and denied his request. Upset, he left the house about 3:45pm. 'He got mad because I didn’t give him what he wanted,' Murry, 34, told the Sun-Times. About an . hour later, he was being taken to the University of Chicago Comer . Children's Hospital, with gunshots to the chest. Police responding to a . report of shots fired found Antonio lying in the backyard of an apartment . building. When . she arrived home and found Antonio gone, Murry said she called police . to report him missing and they arrived five minutes later. 'They . asked me to show a picture of him,' Murry told ABC 7 Chicago. 'Once I did that, they told me to . come to the hospital.' As of Thursday evening, police had no one in custody in the shooting. Chicago . police said a dispute between two factions of a street gang recently . flared in the neighborhood, but they said they don't have any indication . the victim belonged to a gang. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . First responders rush Antonio Smith to the hospital after he was found shot multiple times in a neighbor's backyard . A Chicago ambulance rushed the 9-year-old boy in critical condition to Comer Children's Hospital. Antonio died of his injuries shortly after . Antonio's parents said they know of no reason anyone would target their son. Cousin . Kenya Eggleston said the family was struggling to make sense of the . shooting. 'He was just a child, just a baby, still had a whole . life ahead of him,' she said. Distraught relatives and dozens of others gathered Thursday in the backyard where the boy had been shot a day earlier. 'My baby, he was a good kid,' his mother wailed. 'He was a mama's boy. He stayed up under me. He called me every day. I'm at work, 'Mama, I love you. Mama, can I have this. Mama, can I have that. 'My boy, he was just an angel.' Antonio would have started fourth grade this fall. He loved dancing, hamburgers and telling jokes. Antonio was about to enter fourth grade at the William Augustus Hinton School. He had just started playing Pee Wee football. He loved dancing, hamburgers and telling jokes. His favorite artist was Chris brown. 'All he did was joke and laugh and play,' his mother told the Sun-Times. Outraged public and community leaders were offering a reward Thursday for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the boy's death. 'I love my city, but the city took something from me that I love even more,' Antonio's stepfather, Kawada Hodges, told  ABC 7 Chicago. 'And that was my son. That was my little guy right there.' Antonio is the latest of at least 11 children under 18 years of age who have been shot to death this summer in Chicago, several of them by stray bullets. Activist priest Father Michael Pfleger of Chicago's St. Sabina's Roman Catholic Church gathered with neighborhood residents and others at the murder scene late Thursday. 'We should be as outraged about that as Michael Brown in Ferguson,' Pfleger said, referring to the protests in Ferguson, Missouri after the 18-year-old was fatally shot by a policeman earlier this month. 'At the end of the day, another black child is dead. And whatever the excuse somebody may have done that for — unacceptable.' He announced a $5,000 reward will be offered for information in the case. Other religious leaders have also added to the reward, bringing it to $13,000.","Antonio Smith was shot multiple times in a neighbor's backyard on the city's South Side .

"Rank-and-file IRS workers are again getting a bonus. Commissioner John Koskinen informed IRS employees in an email that they'll get a bonus next March of 1 percent of their base salary. The performance awards go to most employees. 'I believe that rewarding our high-performing employees is a vital investment for our nation's tax system,' Koskinen said in the Monday email that was obtained by The Associated Press. Season's greetings: Commissioner John Koskinen informed IRS employees in an email that they'll get a bonus next March of 1 percent of their base salary - The performance awards go to most employees . The annual awards are down from two years ago, when agency workers received bonuses of 1.75 percent. They were delayed in the summer of 2013 when automatic budget cuts hit the agency, forcing unpaid furloughs and other cost-cutting moves. Some Republicans have questioned the payouts in the wake of revelations that the IRS had wrongly targeted tea party organizations and other advocacy groups seeking tax-exempt status. 'The agency - rife with scandal, mismanagement and unaccountability - is awarding bonuses with the very tax dollars they collect from hardworking Americans,' said Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Hatch noted that a Treasury Department investigation earlier this year concluded that bonuses totaling $2.8 million had gone to more than 2,800 employees found to have broken agency rules of conduct - including 1,100 employees who owed back taxes. Koskinen said that new protections negotiated with the National Treasury Employees Union would deny bonuses to workers who violate the agency's code of conduct. 'Employees violating these basic standards should not be eligible for financial awards,' Koskinen said.","The IRS paid more than $2.8 million in bonuses to employees with disciplinary problems this spring .

"A 22st mother finally decided to go on a diet - and managed to shed half her body weight - after she found herself unable to leave the house for fear of catching a glimpse of herself in a mirror. Joanne Sanderson, 30, was too scared to leave her home in case she caught a glimpse of herself reflected in windows or shop mirrors. She put on weight after giving birth to twin boys in 2002 and spent years eating fried breakfasts and takeaway curries. Super slimmer: Joanne Sanderson lost 11 stone - half of her body weight - after she was too ashamed to look at her own reflection in the mirror . What a difference a year makes: Joanne (pictured, left, now, and right at 22st) was unable to shift the weight but she decided to take action when she started suffering panic attacks every time she caught sight of herself in a mirror . Despite years of yo-yo dieting and taking slimming pills she was unable to shift the weight but she decided to take action when she started suffering panic attacks every time she caught sight of herself in a mirror. The only mirror she kept at home was a tiny 2in wide compact, which she used to apply her make-up every day. Since embarking on a strict calorie-controlled diet last May she has shed 11 stone - half her body weight - and dropped seven dress sizes from 24 to a svelte size 10. Joanne, from Winsford, Cheshire, said: 'When I looked in the mirror I would get very upset. I would break into a sweat, shake and become very anxious. Fear: Joanne, pictured at her wedding in 2009 - the only time she wore a dress in years - was too afraid to leave the house for fear of catching a glimpse of her reflection, so stayed in and ate takeaways . 'It was a horrible feeling so I avoided mirrors at all costs. I only had one tiny mirror in my house and didn't look at my reflection when I was out. 'Even though I knew I was big, seeing it sent me into a panic and it meant I couldn't leave my home. It was horrible and I felt really trapped.' Joanne finally decided to lose weight for good last May after she took her sons swimming and saw just how big she was in the changing room mirrors. Eventually Joanne did get into the pool and shortly afterwards booked sessions with a personal trainer; within weeks the weight started to fall off. Inspiring: Joanne's lifestyle change has encouraged her sons and partner to exercise and adopt healthier diets . New woman: Joanne finally decided to lose weight for good last May after she took her sons swimming and saw just how big she was in the changing room mirrors - she feels like a new person now . Changing face: Joanne, pictured, left, in May 2013 and, right, April 2014, hired a personal trainer and adopted a new healthy diet . She said: 'When I first started I was just under 22st. I began doing hour-long sessions at the gym three times a week and the weight started to come off. 'I was losing, on average, about a stone a month. 'Seeing the results spurred me on to keep going and I began working out five days a week.' The change led Joanne to ditch the takeaways and fry-ups for a healthier diet including lots of fruits and vegetables - and by her 30th birthday last October she had dropped to 13st. She celebrated by buying her first party dress and wore the frock for a night out in Manchester. She added: 'Because of my size, the only time I had ever worn a dress was at my wedding.

Happier than ever: She now fits into a size 10, weighs 11st - and finally enjoys clothes shopping . 'So to be able to celebrate turning 30 by wearing a pretty dress was amazing. 'It was something I never thought I could do.' She now fits into a size 10 and weighs 11ST. Joanne is stunned when friends and family she hasn't seen for a while have no idea who she is. She added: 'I've had so many people say they can't recognise me. They're amazed at the change. 'I look like a new person and feel like one too.' Joanne's lifestyle change has encouraged her sons Louis and Conner, both 11, and civil partner Kelly, 25, to adopt exercise and healthier diets. And the mum has also overcome her fear of her reflection and filled her house with mirrors. She said: 'I love being able to look in the mirror and feel happy.' Breakfast - bacon butty or fry-up .

"It was supposed to be a touching gesture from a loving father to his children. But having their initials tattooed on his arm appears to have backfired for Dragon’s Den star Duncan Bannatyne after Twitter followers ridiculed his new body art. The multi-millionaire tycoon got inked for the first time at 65 years of age during a holiday in Sydney, Australia, with his family. The businessman had 'AHJEET' - the initials of his six children Abigail, Hollie, Jennifer, Eve, Emily and Tom - put on his left arm in bold black letters. One of his 700,000 Twitter followers was  less than impressed with his new artwork, asking; 'Is it supposed to say Eejit?' Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne had 'AHJEET' - the initials of his six children - tattooed on his left arm while on a family holiday in Sydney, Australia . One Twitter user asked the multi-millionaire, ''Is it supposed to say Eejit?' One Twitter user using the name Ken Barlow asked Bannatyne: 'Is it supposed to say Eejit?' Another posted: 'Looks more like you have had your arm franked ready to be posted... Not the best if it is for real.' The Clydebank-born businessman uses 'AHJEET' as a pet name for them and has previously had a company called Ahjeet Limited. Bannatyne told his  followers on the social networking site: 'Age 65 I got my first tattoo in Sydney.

"American scientists have confirmed the discovery of a two-headed bull shark foetus - believed to be the world's first ever. The single shark - with two heads - was found in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a study by Michigan State University and reported in the Journal of Fish Biology. It was discovered by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark in 2011, around a year after the Deepwater horizon oil spill, in the Gulf of Mexico. It comes after scientists confirmed the discovery of a two-headed bull shark foetus - which at the time was believed to be the world's first ever. It was found in the Gulf of Mexico, by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark . While other species of sharks have been born with two heads - including blue sharks and tope sharks - this is the first record of it in a bull shark. Bull sharks are one of only a few species of shark that attacks humans, and are also popular with fisherman, as they put up a 'good fight'. Michael Wagner, MSU assistant professor of fisheries and wildlife, told the Register: 'They're hardy little critters. 'But despite this, the two-headed specimen probably would have died after birth. It was near-to-term, but should have been a lot larger – the body looks to have invested so much energy in growing a separate head that the rest of the body was foreshortened.' MRI scans of the shark revealed two distinct heads, hearts and stomachs. The rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail . The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, with two-headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly. But the creatures rarely live beyond a few months. Each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain, and they share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies. Such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains 'arguing' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig-zag without getting anywhere. In snakes, each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other. Most of the two-headed creatures shortly after birth, and in this case the creature died shortly after it was discovered, . Mr Wagner said there were many  more cases of two-headed lizards and snakes, because they are often bred in captivity where breeders can observe and monitor the oddities. After it was discovered, the shark was taken to the marine science department at Florida Keys Community College and then to Michigan State’s campu where Mr Wagner and his team used magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) to study it. They revealed two distinct heads, hearts and stomachs. The rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail. While the professor noted in his research that some may link the deformed shark to exposure to pollutants, to link it to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill would be 'unwarranted'. He added: 'We simply have no evidence to support that cause or any other.' According to the International Shark . Attack File, there were 80 instances of unprovoked shark attack against . humans in 2012, with seven deaths.","Shark - with two heads, hearts and stomachs - found in Gulf of Mexico .

"Major chain stores have been closing outlets at an average of 20 a day amid a retail bloodbath that is turning many areas into ghost towns. Household names shut 1,779 more stores than they opened last year, which was some ten times worse than the fall of 174 seen in 2011. The figures represent the collapse of the likes of Comet, Game, Clinton Cards and JJB Sports amid a cost of living squeeze and a dramatic shift in shopping patterns. The Government's retail expert Mary Portas says some shopping streets cannot be saved from collapse . Families are cutting back on spending on non-essentials and shifting to shopping online in large numbers in search of lower prices. The net effect is that many urban shopping streets and cavernous concrete town centre malls built in the 1960s are now so empty and run-down that they are beyond being saved. Even the government’s own retail guru, Mary Portas, has said some shopping streets cannot be revived and should be turned over to other uses. There are demands for a radical overhaul in the planning system to allow shops to be replaced with housing and other uses, such as schools and community buildings. The data, drawn from studies of 500 town centres across Britain, found that jewellers, health food shops, travel agents, and sports goods shops were among the hardest hit, along with banks, computer games and clothing stores. Comet closed down amid a cost of living squeeze and a dramatic shift in shopping patterns . By contrast the beneficiaries of austerity and recession were pound shops, pawnbrokers, charity shops, cheque cashing and payday loan companies, and betting shops. There were also more supermarkets and coffee shops, according to the report, which was compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Local Data Company. The organisations suggest the situation is still deteriorating. For the shop closure rate rose to 28 a day since Christmas, following the failures of the likes of Blockbuster, HMV and Jessops. The Local Data Company found there was a total of 7,337 store closures in England during 2012, and 5,558 store openings – a net fall of 1,779. The South East, West Midlands and North West were worst hit, with 376, 265 and 215 more closures than openings respectively. Cheque cashing and payday loan companies fared the best, with a net increase of 121 units, while card and poster shops performed worst, with a net fall of 188 units. Matthew Hopkinson, director of The Local Data Company, said: ‘2012 was the first year that we have seen significant reductions of multiple retailers in town centres across Great Britain with a net loss of nearly 1,800 stores. Jewellers, health food shops, travel agents, and sports goods shops were among the hardest hit, along with banks, computer games and clothing stores . ‘If one takes an average size of 4,000 sq ft per unit, then this equates to over 7 million sq ft of space. This is the equivalent of 131 football pitches, or just over four Westfield London’s.’ Looking ahead, he warned: ‘We can expect to see this trend continue and indeed accelerate in 2013 as more leases come up for renewal along with the ever increasing demands from consumers for space that delivers an experience good enough to pull them away from their technology devices. ‘The end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013 has seen the most dramatic period on record as companies controlling more than 1,400 shops went into administration. ‘Will the discounters, pawnbrokers, charity shops, coffee shops and supermarkets continue to fill a large proportion of these closing stores? ‘Town centres will have to adapt faster than ever before to maintain their attraction to consumers.’ In many locations, small independent shops have filled the gaps left by the major chains. However, a second study, published today(Fri), found that independent shops are no longer opening at a faster rate than they are closing. The British Independent Retail Association said some 594 more small shops opened in 2012 than were closed. This was just one quarter of the increase seen in 2011. Mary Portas was hired by the Prime Minister to devise an action plan to save the high street, however the resulting proposals have failed to deliver any meaningful change. She called for measures to make it easier to change shops to other uses, more free parking in towns and cuts in business rates, but these have been largely ignored. The government did give 15 towns a grant of £100,000 each to resurrect their fortunes as part of a project that Miss Portas will feature in a new TV series. However, the management of these projects has been handicapped by disputes and in-fighting, while much of the cash has not been spent. Chief executive of the British Property Federation, Liz Peace, said: ‘Our towns face complex structural problems that are not going to be solved by tinkering around the edges. ‘In many places, we need to have a complete rethink about how vacant property could be redeveloped into new uses. The alternative is a period of steady, inexorable and irreversible decline with unacceptable social consequences.’","Retail guru, Mary Portas, says some shopping streets cannot be revived .

Mr Simmons remains free on $45,000 bail. He had Coogan are due back in court February 15. Matthew Coogan, a recent graduate of a Master's program at the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at NYU, was not charged with rape because under Delaware law it is legal to have consensual sex with a 16-year-old if you are younger than 30. Scholar: Coogan was a graduate student at the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at NYU studying foreign intervention in Syria . According to the 23-year-old’s indictment cited by Delaware Online, he allegedly solicited the teenager for sex with Simmons, thus aiding in the act of committing rape. The case came to light in April when a student at Salesianum School learned about a classmate‘s sexual encounter on March 19 and contacted police. When investigators interviewed Coogan, the man admitted that he and Simmons had talked about his desire 'to engage in a sex act with a younger person, with the target age being a high school age male,' according to the arrest warrant.’ Following his May arrest, the prosecutor also confessed to knowing having sex with a minor. The 16-year-old victim told police that he and Matthew Coogan had exchanged messages of Grindr and agreed to have a tryst at Simmons' house in Pine Creek. On March 19, Coogan allegedly picked up the teen from school and drove him to the prosecutor’s townhouse, where the two were joined by Simmons a short time later for a threesome. During the group sexual encounter, the 16-year-old was quoted as telling his two partners: 'I'm only 16, take it easy on me.’ Boss: Just days after his arrest, the prosecutor resigned from his post in the office of State Attorney General Beau Biden (pictured), the vice president's son .","Matthew Coogan, 23, charged with two counts of sexual solicitation of a child and a second-degree conspiracy .

"Barack Obama is set to call for a new push to reduce the world's nuclear arsenal today when he delivers a highly anticipated speech in Berlin. The U.S. President will direct his argument both at Russia's Vladimir Putin and at Congress, making the case for a reduction of one third in the nuclear weapons held by the U.S. and Russia. His speech at the iconic Brandenburg Gate will have a lot to live up to, drawing comparisons with John F. Kennedy's 'Ich bin ein Berliner' address, which took place almost exactly 50 years ago. Scroll down for videos . Meeting: Barack Obama with German chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of a landmark speech in Berlin . Allies: The two leaders kiss as they meet outside the city's chancellery today . Crowds: Mr Obama greeting children gathered at the Schloss Bellevue in Berlin today . Mr Obama is also seeking to live up to a speech he himself made in 2008 while running for election, which drew 200,000 supporters and cemented his reputation as a global 'rock star' politician. The President is expected to attract a much less rapturous reception at his speech today, scheduled for 3pm local time (9am EDT). He will look to make an impact with another call for nuclear disarmament, following a number of past speeches arguing for a reduction in the world's stockpile. The issue was at the centre of his foreign policy when he first came to office, but has since fallen down the agenda in the wake of turmoil in the Middle East and the continuing global economic crisis.

Guard of honour: The two presidents walk past a line of sailors outside the Schloss Bellevue . It is unclear whether Mr Obama is planning to negotiate a new treaty or merely to sign a non-binding agreement, which would not need ratification by Congress. His calls for co-operation with Moscow come at a time of high tension between the U.S. and Russia, which have clashed over Syria's civil war and American missile defence plans in Europe. Mr Obama will also press Congress to pass ban on nuclear tests, an initiative which has been in the works for years but has stalled recently. It is believed that other than the U.S. and Russia, France has about 300 nuclear warheads, China 240, Britain 225, and Israel, India and Pakistan roughly 100 each.

"When Jennifer Lopez, 45, performed at the recent American Music Awards it was her performance - and not those of her younger contemporaries - that got everyone talking. Despite the fact that Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and Jessie J all took to the Nokia Theatre stage it was mother-of-two J-Lo whosent Twitter into a frenzy thanks to those abs, that bum and her super sexy dancing. Even 24-year-old Iggy Azalea, who joined J-Lo on stage to perform their hit duet Booty, couldn't help but tweet her appreciation of Jennifer's famous figure. 'And of course [J-Lo] made me look like a pile of dog poo standing next to he because she's so perfect. seriously tho, i love her. babeville,' she said. Scroll down for video . Is 2014 Jennifer Lopez's sexiest year yet? Performing at the American Music Awards over the weekend Jennifer Lopez wasn't shy about showing off her toned and tanned body . Careful you don't get stuck like that: Jennifer lifts one leg in the air whilst performing at the American Awards show . A quick costume change! J-Lo wore two outfits to perform at the event including this red sequinned jumpsuit and jacket combo . On the red carpet: Jen rocked a pink wrapped Reem Acra dress on the red carpet showing off her toned abs . And this isn't the first time Jen has caused a stir this year. From her controversial video for Booty which had saw both Jen and Iggy rolling around in vats of oil shaking their bottoms, to the silver Charbel Zoe gown she wore to the Video Music Awards in August which featured more cut out than actual dress, Jen's certainly been turning up the heat over the last 12 months. Because, lest we not forget, whilst she did set hearts racing in THAT split-to-the-waist green Versace dress in 2000, J-Lo's noughties wardrobe was actually more demure than daring. In fact there was a time when you were more likely to find her rocking a roll-neck on the red carpet than rolling around in her underwear. Summer style: In July J-LO rocked the stage at the iHeartRadio Ultimate Pool Party in Miami Beach in a revealing costume . Forget your skirt? Jennifer showed off her famous 'ass-et' at the Fashion Rocks show in New York in September . There's even a song about it: Jen released Booty with fellow singer Iggy Azalea, all about women with big bums . When she attended the premiere of An Unfinished Life in 2002 it was in a high-necked jumper and a fish tail skirt that left only her hands exposed. Two years later she showed up to a Marc Jacobs show in a simple shift dress that would be more at home in your mother's work wear wardrobe than on one of the the most famous bodies in the world. And whilst out with the former loves of her life, one-time fiance Ben Affleck and ex-husband and father of her children Mark Anthony, Jen always made sure to stay covered up. So what inspired Jen's super sexy make over? It seems her current urge to show off her incredibly body comes down to the fact that she's been working pretty hard to get it in shape. Remember this? In 2000 Jennifer caused a huge stir when she wore this daring Versace gown . Back in the day: During the noughties Jen rocked a very different look, pictured here in 2002 (left) at a film premiere and 2004 at a Marc Jacobs fashion show she was then a fan of the high neckline . Channelling Sandra Dee? Promoting her perfume Glow by J-Lo in 2004 . Jen liked to dress down for her men: At the Vanity Fair Oscar's party in 2003 with Ben Affleck she covered up (left) doing the same to watch American football with ex-husband Marc Anthony in 2009 (right) Jen revealed in an interview earlier this year: ‘I've got an athletic body, I've worked out my whole life and I've been incredibly disciplined when I needed to be.’ ‘I'm not one to overindulge. It doesn't make me feel good. Some people find it comforting to sit down and eat a whole pint of Häagen-Dazs, but honestly that would make me throw up. I don't think I've ever eaten that much.’ Although she does like to relax some times: ‘Mentally, I'm always thinking about it. I'm ok looking this way, but at the same time that ambitious, determined girl inside me is like, 'Come on, let's be in the best shape ever and really show everybody.' Then the other side of me thinks, 'Let's just relax on the beach chair.' Don't be fooled by the rocks that she's got! In 2007 Jen rocked a hippy chic look as she attended the launch of the Just Cavalli flagship store in New York . Maternity style: Although as a mother Jennifer has been critisised for her racy performances and costumes when she was pregnant with her twins, Emme and Max, she was anything but . And although the mother faced criticism for her latest performance she has previously revealed that she doesn't feel her on stage outfits are any worse than others in the music industry. 'I don’t think I’m any racier than any other female pop artist, she said, 'Ok, I’ll wear a sexy outfit, but I think it’s more because my body shape’s a little different to other body shapes, so that’s not very fair.' When she’s not on tour J-Lo trains with LA based fitness instructor Tracy Anderson. A favourite to the stars, Tracy is well known for having transformed the bodies of Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Well that's one way to get everyone going: Jen set hearts racing in this sexy green beaded jumpsuit as she performed at the opening ceremony of the world cup in Brazil earlier this year . More cut out than dress: Jen rocked an amazing Charbel Zoe cut out gown to the Video Music Awards in Los Angeles in August . Tracy says that when she works with Jennifer their main focus is: ‘Keeping her sexy butt toned.’ Adding that they regularly switch up their work outs: ‘We change the workout every 10 workouts. That’s the secret. We can only stay on a movement every 10 days. And Jen's no stranger to putting the hours in. ‘She needs to get her exercise in one hour each day,’ she said, ‘30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of muscular structure.’ Tracy has also admitted that Jen never goes more than two days without working out such is her dedication to keeping her body in shape. Anyone would think she'd like you to look at her bum: Jen wasn't afraid of showing off her bottom during her AMA's performance .

"General Mills was the only one of the top 10 food and drink companies in the world that had not improved its sourcing policies . The company that sells Haagen-Dazs, Green Giant and Yoplait in the UK has fallen to the bottom of an Oxfam ranking after failing to improve its social and environmental policies, the charity said. General Mills, which also sells the Old El Paso and Betty Crocker brands, was the only one of the top 10 food and drink companies in the world that had not improved its sourcing policies, Oxfam said. The charity's 'Behind the Brands' campaign measures the sourcing policies of the 10 biggest food and drink companies, looking at transparency, women's rights and rights of workers, farmers, land, water and climate. Oxfam said that while progress had been made by some of the companies on land, women's rights and carbon emissions and some leading companies had made 'major strides', overall the 'big 10' had moved too slowly as a group. It said that before the campaign launched a year ago, none of the 10 companies had policies to ensure their ingredients were not grown on land that had been taken from communities. Now, six had policies to help ensure their suppliers were not involved in land grabs, seven had committed to improving conditions for women affected by their operations and eight had improved their policies on climate, mainly through better disclosing their emissions and risks related to climate change.

The company has fallen to the bottom of Oxfam's list of companies for not improving its social and environmental policies . The rankings as listed by Oxfam for this year, showing a total score adding up points relating to land, women, farmers, workers, climate, transparency and water, are:1. Nestle 45/702. Unilever 44/703. Coca-Cola 38/704. Mondelez 23/704. PepsiCo 23/706. Danone 22/706. Mars 22/708. Kellogg's 20/709. Associated British Foods 19/7010. General Mills 15/70 . Oxfam's campaigns and policy director, Ben Phillips, said: 'Consumer power and investors are pushing most of the top 10 food and drink companies in the right direction and we are beginning to see what this can mean for poor and vulnerable people. 'These companies, with so much power and influence, can do so much more and while some are showing leadership, others are clinging to a business model that is outdated and fails to respect human rights. 'Pressure from consumers is what pushed companies to be more responsible and so much more is possible if people continue to add their voice.' The top three performers - Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola - all improved their scores by the biggest margins, Oxfam said. A Greenpeace report blames the company which makes Head & Shoulders shampoo for using suppliers accused of clearing Indonesian rainforest . A Greenpeace report has blamed the company which makes Head & Shoulders shampoo for helping to wipe out orangutans. Proctor and Gamble, which makes the anti-dandruff shampoo, has been accused of failing to follow other companies by not using suppliers which are clearing parts of the Indonesian rainforest for palm oil. A year long investigation by the charity claims to have traced palm oil in Head & Shoulders shampoo and its shaving cream to suppliers accused of destroying the orangutans' habitat. The suppliers - BW Plantation, KLK and Musim Mas - were all slammed in the report. Palm oil is an ingredient of so many day to day products. In too many cases rainforest is illegally destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations. Of approximately 11 million hectares of oil palm plantations globally, about six million hectares are found in Indonesia. But in many places, these plantations are taking over rainforests, the natural habitat of endangered species such as orangutans. The Sumatran tiger is also under threat according to Greenpeace. Proctor and Gamble, whose Head & Shoulders advert stars England goalkeeper Joe Hart, said it is continuing its pledge that all of its palm oil will be 'sustainably sourced' by next year. A spokesman said: 'P&G is committed to the sustainable sourcing of palm oil.  We have made a public commitment that, by 2015, 100 per cent of all palm oil purchases we make will be sustainably sourced and we are working with our suppliers to ensure we deliver on this commitment. 'We are strongly opposed to irresponsible deforestation practices and take any allegation of impropriety by our suppliers very seriously. 'We will investigate any allegations made to ensure that our policy on the responsible and sustainable sourcing of palm oil have been, and will continue to be, adhered to. 'P&G is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), we support the RSPO criteria established for sustainable palm oil, and we are part of the working group on sustainable sourcing of palm oil derivatives.'

You’ve got to be able to protect those things. How else could you exist? You'd go crazy, anybody would go crazy.' The row erupted after Johansson featured in an advert for the fizzy drinks firm which featured in the SuperBowl earlier this month. The 29-year-old actress said she had a 'fundamental difference of opinion' with the charity after it said it opposed all trade from Israeli settlements because they say it is illegal and denies Palestinian rights. SodaStream has a large factory in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank - a territory captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians. Johansson instead chose to keep her role as brand ambassador for SodaStream, saying she supports trade and 'social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine'.

And she explained how she turned down the £33million signing when he invited her out to dinner during his World Cup preparation weeks before he was pictured on a romantic beach holiday in Mexico with his current girlfriend. MailOnline has been unable to verify whether Miss Andrade can support her claims and attempts to contact Sanchez for comment have failed to elicit a response. 'He invited me out for dinner': Former Miss Chile Camila Andrade (pictured, left, during the Miss World opening ceremony last year) has accused Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez (right, with his girlfriend Laia Grassi) of texting her behind his lover's back . Beauty: Miss Andrade (pictured) claimed she turned down the £33million Arsenal striker when he invited her out to dinner during his World Cup preparation weeks before he was pictured on a romantic beach holiday in Mexico with his girlfriend . In reports which have made headlines across the  media in Chile, Miss Andrade, 23, told an interviewer in her home country how he asked her out earlier this year. She said: 'Alexis invited me out for a meal while he was back in Chile preparing for the World Cup. 'I was between boyfriends at the time and it was the first time that he'd asked if we could meet up. 'I turned him down because he wasn't my type and I knew that many of the times he'd messaged me he was with his girlfriend and I liked that even less. 'When he was in Disneyland Paris with Laia in February he sent me a picture of himself on his own. 'I knew he was with her because I'd seen pictures in the paper and I really couldn't stop laughing. 'I messaged him to say: ""How nice, you're with your girlfriend, I've love to be where you are with my boyfriend"" and he replied: ""No I'm with my little nephew or young cousin or some young relative"", I can't remember exactly. 'He never said he was with his girlfriend and the following day there was a big picture in the paper of the two of them. It was very strange. 'All these starstruck young girls need to see all these footballers are the same and are not to be believed.'

Miss Andrade said 'starstruck  girls need to see all these footballers are the same and not to be believed' It's not the first time Sanchez, 25, has made headlines off the pitch. Spanish art director and designer Laia stuck by the Premiership marksman, who has scored six goals in his last four games, when an old squeeze claimed she was pregnant with the football star’s child. The day after Barcelona-based Mary Plaza, 28, made her pregnancy claim in April Laia posted a picture of her and Alexis on her Instagram page with the message: 'Amor Verdadero' - Spanish for 'True Love.' Another ex, Brazilian model Michelle Carvalho, claimed last year the blue-eyed Spanish blonde, who posed in an Arsenal shirt on her Instagram page after Alexis joined the Gunners in July, was fooling herself if she thought she was the love of his life. She said: 'I don't think it's anything stable, I think it's a passing thing. He only wants a good time.'

She revealed: 'I was with an ex-boyfriend when he sent his first message. 'I'd never met him in my life so when he said he was Alexis Sanchez, I replied saying: ""No, you're lying, you know what, Ciao."" 'He responded by phoning me straight away. I didn't answer him. I rejected the call. 'Why am I going to answer him if I don't know him? And then he sent me a message saying I phoned you so you'd know it was me.'

She added: 'I've no idea how he got my number but he did what a lot of footballers like him do which is to speak to girls via Whatsapp. 'I don't want to go into so much detail, but I have to say he seemed very kind and very funny. 'It makes me laugh how all the young girls speak to him. I could never ever have taken seriously some of the things he said to me. 'We never had regular conversations but I stopped answering him about two months ago after I turned down his meal invite. 'I found it tasteless he'd ask me out while he was with someone else so I gave him the red card. 'When someone doesn't answer you, I think the other person normally gets it and understands that you don't want to speak with them.

"The speech pattern is associated with young women from southern California, notably Clueless lead character Cher Horowitz (pictured) First men became enamoured with grooming regimes, but now it seems the metrosexual man has started talking in a more feminine way too. A new study has revealed that modern men are starting to ‘uptalk’ by rising in pitch at the ends of sentences. The speech pattern is associated with . young women from southern California, notably Clueless lead character . Cher Horowitz, but is now common amongst younger people. Scientists came across the finding when . they were trying to investigate the difference between uptalkers making a . statement and asking a question. Uptalkers are stereotypically parodied as insecure, shallow and not very clever females. However, scientists from the University of California, San Diego, who recorded the voices of 24 young southern Californians, found that the 12 men they studied also uptalked and the speakers came from different backgrounds - not just mansions in Beverley Hills. They were given several speech tasks, such as providing directions from a map, or recounting what happened after watching a clip from a popular sitcom. ‘We found use of uptalk in all of our speakers, despite their diverse backgrounds in socio-economic status, ethnicity, bilingualism and gender,’ study leader Dr Amanda Ritchart, a linguist at the university said. The research, which was presented at the annual meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in San Francisco, identified a crucial difference between uptalkers making a statement and asking a question. In a statement, the rise in pitch began significantly later than in a question. Scientists discovered that Californian men have begun to 'uptalk' by rising in pitch at the ends of sentences when they set out to investigate the difference between uptalkers making a statement and asking a question . But the difference was so subtle that non-uptalkers often missed it, according to Professor Amalia Arvaniti, formerly at the University of California, San Diego, who is now at the University of Kent. ‘Our study busts the stereotype associated with uptalk that those who speak uptalk actually ask questions instead of make statements, a tendency that is supposed to be linked to insecurity,' she said. ‘But native southern California speakers know the difference based on the exact location of the rise start, and the extent to which pitch changes in the rise.’ It would appear that the key to climbing the career ladder doesn't include what - or who - you know. The essential ingredient for a man to become a successful boss lies in a deep voice. Research by Duke University in North Carolina has discovered that men with lower voices make more money, run larger companies, and stay in their jobs longer - although they did not examine the way in which someone speaks beyond pitch. Specialists studied 792 male chief executives of American companies and found a distinct correlation between wages and the pitch of voices. Those with deeper voices had a distinct advantage over their high-pitched peers, as they were found to earn more. The median CEO of the study was a 56-year-old with a 125.5 Hz vocal frequency and earned £2.4 million ($3.7 million) for leading a £1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) company, The Times reported. Executives with voices on the deeper end of the scale earned, on average, £121,000 ($187,000) more in pay and ran operations with £286 million ($440 million) more in assets. Researchers claim that lower pitched voices are linked to dominant behaviour, because deep voices are related to high testosterone levels, The Times reported.","Scientists from the University of California, San Diego, recorded the voices of 24 young people and found that the 12 men they studied 'uptalked'

"Bribery: Chinese student Yang Li was jailed for 12 months after offering his professor £5,000 in cash in a bid to pass his degree . The son of a Chinese government official was jailed yesterday for trying to bribe a British university professor with £5,000 to pass his degree. Yang Li also took an imitation firearm into the meeting with the don and another senior academic at Bath University. A court heard that Li, 26, was studying a masters degree in innovation and technology management and feared failure. He was dismayed to learn he had been given just 37 per cent for his dissertation which was a fail - and would have meant him spending an extra year at the university. That would have affected Li’s visa which he was hoping to upgrade from a student visa to a tier 1 visa. Li, who was born and educated in China, asked to meet Professor Andrew Graves and Dr Stephen Shepherd to discuss his options. Bristol Crown Court heard he told the pair ‘I am a businessman’ before placing £5,000 in cash on the table. He then said: 'There is a fourth option, you can keep the money if you give me a pass mark and I won’t bother you again.' When that failed and he was asked to leave he picked up his coat and a 0.177 air pistol fell from the pocket. Defending Li, Blake James said Mr Li came from an affluent family in China, where his father is a respected government official and businessman. Mr James said Li was not a 'sham student' and had come to the UK in 2006 for a Computer Science degree at the University of Bath, which he passed. He claimed Li had withdrawn the money that morning ‘for the weekend’ and had not meant to use it as a bribe. He added that the gun was in his pocket as he thought it was safer than the car, and he had no intention of using the weapon which he used for target practice. Mr Blake-James said: 'Mr Li is someone who is used to carrying large amounts of cash with him. 'He was not thinking straight, he made an impulsive decision to use the money he had on him, which was a ridiculous gesture and ill-thought through.' He added: 'One of Mr Li’s pleasures is shooting in the garden of his house, and he intended to return to it after the meeting. 'He had the gun in the pocket of his coat as he didn’t want to leave it in the car, he felt it was safer with him. Li, 26, was studying a masters degree in innovation and technology management at the University of Bath . 'It was in no way connected to his meeting. 'In his haste to leave the meeting, he picked up his coat and the gun fell to the floor.' Mr Blake-James said Li was of good character and from an affluent and successful family, with his father a Chinese government official and businessman. His parents, wife, who is also studying at the university, and parents in law were in court to support him. Documents show Li was progressing well in his masters course until he failed the dissertation, he said. At the time of the final module, Li was working for his father’s firm, earning £25,000 a year with a bonus of £11,000, as well as studying. Prosecuting, Mark Hollier said: 'The final part of the course is for students to submit a dissertation of about 12,000 words. That had to be in by the first week of September. Mr Li’s dissertation was submitted that September last year. 'It was marked by Professor Graves. The pass mark is 40 per cent and the mark awarded was 37 per cent.' Li’s dissertation mark was checked by external examiners from Oxford and Cambridge University and found to be correct, Mr Hollier added. Firearm: When Li's attempts at bribery failed and he was asked to leave he picked up his coat and this air pistol fell from the pocket . Li, 26, of Wellsway, Bath, admitted bribery and possession of an imitation firearm.He was sentenced to 12 months in prison for bribery and six months on the firearms charge, to run concurrently. Judge Michael Longman told him: 'Any form of corruption or incitement to a person in any manner amounts to a serious offence which must be taken seriously by the court. 'Your bid to achieve a pass mark by offering what was a bribe to your professor was ill conceived to the point of being a spectacular mistake and one which was doomed to fail from the start. 'You withdrew the large sum of money that morning, and I do not accept that offering the money was on impulse or done in the heat of the moment. 'It was planned and deliberate and demonstrated a failure to comprehend the high standards adhered to by the public and private offices in the UK. 'This was made even more serious by the fact that you had an imitation firearm in your possession. 'I have no doubt that it provoked fear in Professor Graves, though I am satisfied that you did not acquire it for the purpose of the meeting. 'But you plainly did know you had it on you, and you risked others at the meeting seeing it.' Li, who has spent five months in custody, plans to return to China with his wife after his release because his current visa has now expired. Wealthy Chinese families are spending fortunes getting their children into prestigious British universities and are increasingly turning to agents to help find places. One such company  BE Education, set up by British entrepreneur and old-Etonian William Vanbergen, 30, in 2003, promises to 'prepare China’s young future leaders for success in an increasingly interconnected world'. BE Education has placed 24 Chinese students in UK universities and regularly gets about 150 a year into British public schools. The firm’s fees have reportedly now risen to £100,000 for successfully placing candidates in top establishments. In total, 78,715 students from China attended UK universities in 2011/12, a 17 per cent rise in the last academic year. British businessman Neil Heywood, who was murdered in China in 2011, is understood to have arranged admission to his old school Harrow for the son of Chinese politician Bo Xilai. Last year Bo Xilai's wife Gu Kailai, 53, was found guilty of poisoning Mr Heywood and sentenced to 14 years in jail. The son, Bo Guagua, who later went to Oxford and Harvard, was said to have fallen into an ‘economic dispute’ dispute with Mr Heywood. Bo, known for a love of champagne and shisha parties while studying at Oxford, was allegedly told by Mr Heywood: ‘If you do not give me £13million, you will be destroyed.’","Yang Li told university don 'I'm a businessman' before placing cash on table .

"It is the question that has been dominating Washington dinner parties for weeks – could the once-golden First Couple of the United States really be heading for the rocks? If rumours are to be believed, the 21-year marriage of Barack and Michelle Obama has been racked by screaming rows, allegations of infidelity and a string of jealous fights. While the White House has refused to comment on the reports there has been a distinct frostiness in the air between the couple in recent months. OCTOBER 31, 2013 Sweet... and sour: The Obamas hand out Halloween sweets to children at the White House in a rare lapse from the First Lady's healthy-eating campaigning. The President jokes about his wife's disapproval of the treats, saying: 'I told her the White House will get egged if we don't' DECEMBER 10, 2013 Not amused: Stoney-faced Michelle grits her teeth and rolls her eyes skyward as Obama snaps his now infamous 'selfie' with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and David Cameron at Nelson Mandela's memorial . According to a report in the National Enquirer – which plastered ‘Obama Divorce Bombshell!’ across its front page  – the pair have been at loggerheads since last summer and are now sleeping in separate bedrooms. The ‘final straw’, apparently, was Michelle’s outrage when her husband publicly humiliated her by openly flirting and posing for his now infamous ‘selfie’ photograph with Denmark’s glamorous blonde Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service. According to published reports, Mrs Obama is only standing by her 52-year-old husband until his presidency ends. DECEMBER 18, 2013 Oh do shut up dear: Clearly bored, the First Lady listens impassively as her husband defends his healthcare  reforms at a meeting with families inside the Oval Office. One observer says: 'She looked like she'd heard it all before and found it uninteresting. Her body language spoke volumes.' DECEMBER 21, 2013-JANUARY 4, 2014 Paradise lost: The couple arrive in Hawaii for Christmas but the body language during a basketball game in Honolulu is described as 'frosty' Distance: The President spent time on the golf course with friends before returning to Washington with daughters Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12. The White House says Mrs Obama stayed behind to mark her birthday with friends including Oprah Winfrey . DECEMBER 25, 2013 Smiling through: The happiness looks fragile as the Obamas embrace the festive season by posing together in front of one of 24 Christmas trees in the White House. They posted this picture on Twitter . JANUARY 16, 2014 Oops, missed: An awkward embrace after a university address about plans to help disadvantaged students attend college. A witness said: 'Barack tried to kiss Michelle on the lips as she came onstage but she turned her cheek.' He will then return to his home state of Hawaii while she will remain with their daughters in Washington. The Enquirer is famously well-connected in Washington, and has broken stories which America’s mainstream media chose to ignore, including Democratic presidential contender John Edwards’s secret love child and Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. Whether or not the gossip is true, the newly slim First Lady (she credits a vegetarian diet for a recent 10lb weight loss) seems to be soaring in self-confidence, showing off her figure in a succession of form-fitting designer gowns. JANUARY 17, 2014 Unhappy birthday: A beaming Michelle celebrates her 50th birthday but her husband¿s plan for a big birthday bash backfired, according to reports, when Michelle refused his wish for a formal dinner and they got into 'a screaming match' JANUARY 27, 2014 Lonely job: Obama looks tired in the Oval Office preparing his State Of The Union Address last week. His wife later stole the headlines in a spectacular forest-green dress by Azzedine Alaia . At her 50th birthday celebrations she was rarely by her husband’s side, with one guest saying: ‘She was working the room. She’s looking better than ever and was exuding a sexiness and confidence that wasn’t there before. ‘She’s come into her own. Only time will tell what happens next.’","Rumours surround frostiness between the couple in recent months .

"An elderly couple returned from holiday to find a Polish burglar lying asleep in their bed after he broke in and spent two days treating their house as his own home. Intruder Lukasz Chojnowski, 28, enjoyed a bubble bath, cooked dinner and even tidied the home of Pat Dyson, 73, and her partner Martin Holtby, 78, in Nelson, Lancashire, while they were away on five day National Trust break. When they returned they found Chojnowski, who had come to the UK to find work, but had lost his lodgings due to language problems, sleeping in their bed and called the police. Intruder: Lukasz Chojnowski, 28, enjoyed a bubble bath, cooked dinner and even tidied the home of Pat Dyson, 73, and her partner Martin Holtby, 78, after breaking into their house in Nelson, Lancashire, while they were away on five day National Trust break . Property: Burnley Crown Court was told that Chojnowski thought the couple's house was empty after seeing their overgrown 'wildlife garden' The couple also found that a chicken fillet and pasta dinner had been prepared, dinner plates, post and newspapers were neatly stacked, the bath filled with water and even the intruder’s socks and underwear hanging out to dry. Just like the Goldilocks fairytale Mr Holtby, exclaimed: 'Someone’s been sleeping in my bed - and he’s still here?' before prodding their unwelcome house guest awake as Mrs Dyson called police. Chojnowski later claimed he had been evicted from his regular lodgings, thought the couple’s terraced house was 'derelict' and forced open a rear window. Nothing had been taken from their home. Chojnowski, an upholsterer, pleaded guilty to burglary and theft at Burnley Crown Court. The court was told that Mrs Dyson, a former tourist information officer and Mr Holtby, a retired civil servant had gone to Hereford on a sightseeing trip. Shock: Mr Holtby, pictured with the torch he used to wake the intruder, had exclaimed: 'Someone’s been sleeping in my bed - and he’s still here?' before prodding their unwelcome house guest awake . On their return at midnight on July 14, they noticed no post behind the front door and the cordless telephone moved from its base on a table in the hallway. The couple went into the kitchen and found bags of pasta, processed cheese and the chicken fillets on the worktops. Tim Ashmole, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Holtby went upstairs and his partner heard him say: “What are you doing? Get out, get up.” 'She became immediately alarmed, ran upstairs and came across a bizarre situation where Mr Holtby was standing over the defendant, who was in bed. She described Chojnowski as cowering under the bed sheets.' Unwanted guest: Mrs Dyson (pictured) said that in terms of burglars, Chojnowski was 'the most domesticated one I could ever ask for', and would even consider hiring him as a butler . Mr Ashmole said an open suitcase, containing Chojnowski’s belongings, was on the floor. The bath was half-full of hot water, with bubbles on top as if someone had just had a bath and there was a smell of perfume. The couple tried to communicate with Chojnowski, who spoke little English, before calling 999 and Mrs Dyson locked the front door to prevent the intruder escaping. Mr Ashmole said: 'In short, the defendant was making himself very much at home in their address. 'It’s quite an extraordinary state of affairs to come across. The Crown’s case is he just took pot luck, hoping that nobody would come back in the immediate future. He looked though some jewellery boxes, but he did not take anything. He was using the home as a cosy little hideaway.' The court was told that Chojnowski had been asked to leave his rented home due to language problems and while searching for a new place to stay had spotted the overgrown 'wildlife garden' at the front of the couple’s home. 'The defendant chose the house because he initially thought it was empty,' said Laura Heywood, mitigating. Return: The couple returned to their home (left) to find the bath (right) half-full of hot water, with bubbles on top as if someone had just had a bath, and there was a smell of perfume . 'He said the garden was overgrown and he entered. At that point, he must have known somebody was residing there. He stayed there for two days, hoping the owners wouldn’t return, out of necessity, because he didn’t have anywhere else to stay.' Chojnowski, now of Bury, was given a two year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £200 costs. Judge Mr Recorder Raymond Herman said: 'It would appear you entered this property not with any deep intent to be dishonest, but simply as somewhere to live and probably hide for some days. You were looking for somewhere to live in some sort of desperation. 'It’s right to say Mrs Dyson and Mr Holtby are at pains to ensure the court understands that they feel you left the house in a neat and tidy condition and from that I infer they feel some sympathy for you.' Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Dyson said: 'It was all just so surreal and not something you expect to come home to but at least it wasn’t like some of these awful things you see on Crimewatch. 'The post and papers were neatly stacked in a pile and there were plates neatly stacked on the draining board and he had obviously made himself dinner. I was calling police when Martin said ""Pat - there is someone sleeping in our bed and he’s still here."" 'It was just like something out of Goldilocks. 'We prodded him to wake him up but he just moaned and went deeper into the covers. As I walked back to go downstairs I noticed there was water in the bath and the towels had been left on the floor all wet. I also noticed he had done his washing. He had put the airer up and put his smalls and t-shirts out to dry. 'When the man woke up was completely bedfuddled - and I don’t think he knew what to think. A policewoman was there when they escorted him out.' She added: 'I don’t know how he could think our house was derelict. Martin has volunteered as an estate manager and worked in woodland management for the last 30 years and he likes our garden to be like that. 'In terms of burglars he was the most domesticated one I could ever ask for. Fancy washing his dishes and airing his smalls. I would happily put up in the cellar as our butler - I think he would be very good at that. 'I have been told he was living with other polish folk and got kicked out - I can only assume he was too tidy for them, insisting he would always do the washing up.'","Pat Dyson, 73, and Martin Holtby, 78, found Lukasz Chojnowski in their bed .

"Danny Wilson has been sacked by Barnsley - less than two months after he celebrated his 1,000th game as a manager. The decision comes off the back off Tuesday night's 2-1 home defeat by Fleetwood Town which has left the Tykes 17th in the League One table.

Explaining the decision, a club statement read: 'Danny joined the club at a very difficult time which was a testament to his character and affection for the club – all the while demonstrating the utmost professionalism during his time with the club. Danny will always be welcome back at Oakwell. 'The success he brought during his initial period with the club is unrivalled and the club will be forever grateful for his achievements. Wilson could not prevent relegation last season and Barnsley have stuttered this campaign . 'However, recent performances and results have been concerning, considering the club currently boasts the fifth highest wage bill in League One in addition to a fourth highest equity donation by our owner. 'Meanwhile, our current League position of 17th is in stark contrast to an average home gate of sixth-best in the division.

"An Australian teenager has put herself through 10 weeks of extreme dieting and intense exercise regimes and treatments - including eating baby food and taking daily ice baths - in the quest to achieve the perfect body. Queensland University of Technology film student Madeleine Humphreys spent the 10 weeks undertaking the excessive fads and treatments for a participatory-style documentary she and fellow filmmaker Kate Paul have submitted for a class project. The bizarre diets - including a week of baby food and another of just cabbage soup - left the 19-year-old two dress sizes smaller at the end of the 10-week period. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Extreme: Madeleine Humphreys underwent 10 weeks of extreme diets, beauty treatments and exercise regimes in the quest for the perfect body . Am I Perfect? Budding filmmakers Kate Paul (left) and Madeleine Humphreys have fun on the set while they film their documentary . All over: Madeleine was all smiles at the end of the extreme 10-week experiement that saw her drop 22kg (48lbs) Ms Humphreys said the documentary, titled Am I Perfect? was an attempt to discover what it means to be 'perfect', why people strive for 'perfection' and if it's really worth the effort. Going into the challenge the pair made a list of celebrity diets, exercise regimes and the most popular beauty treatments. She concluded the pursuit of perfection, which included the intense fitness regime Cross Fit and freckle removal via laser, was not worth it. Ms Paul, 23, said Madeleine ended up losing 22kg (48lbs), and started to go a 'little bit crazy'  - especially during the third week when she was eating primarily baby food. 'She ended up not being able to stomach the baby food and stopped eating as a result,' she told the MailOnline. 'That was definitely one of her lowest weeks - she was really down and struggling to complete her daily requirements. 'It was a bit insane - she started going a bit crazy and dreaming about food. She wasn't all there sometimes and went a bit wacky. There were times when she didn't have to train she would just stay in bed because she had no energy.' A screen shot from the documentary Am I Perfect? shows singer Katy Perry naked on a cloud, which many people believe puts pressure on young women to have a certain body type . Single ladies: Beyonce's film clip shows three women in provocative and revealing clothes . Kate Paul, who co-wrote the script for Am I Perfect?, said women like Miranda Kerr featuring regularly in magazines made many women feel the need to look like them . The baby food diet, which involves replacing two daily meals with jars of homemade pureed baby food and keeping the third meal of the day under 600 calories, gained a cult following after actresses Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon revealed they had experimented with it. Ms Humphreys said the baby food was horrible way of living - but not as bad as the week on the master cleanse (lemon detox) diet. 'It’s a liquid only diet with a mix of maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water and I was combining it with ice baths and an hour’s stairwalking,' she told the Herald Sun. She also tried the macrobiotic diet, the cabbage soup diet and raw food diet - fads actresses Gwenyth Paltrow, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Demi Moore were following respectively in the past. Ms Paul said the pair consulted with a dietician and nurse regularly to ensure their were no serious health risks. 'It actually got the point where the nurse said (Maddie) needed to stop because she was losing the weight so quickly,' she said. 'At the beginning she didn't care but she became really focused on what people thought. She was counting calories all the time and trying to get the scales down. It's that type of mentality that can lead to eating disorders.' Feeling hot, hot, hot: A woman practising hot yoga, which Madeleine also did during her 10-week experiment . A group of people doing a CrossFit session, which Madeleine did as part of her 10-week documentary Am I Perfect? You're as cold as ice: Madeleine said having a daily ice bath, such as the one pictured above, was one of the craziest things she's ever done . The idea for the documentary came about while the budding filmmakers were sitting in a cafe when they noticed an abundance of women's magazines promoting a range of treatments and fad diets. 'It's an issue we are so bombarded with, there is so much pressure on women and their body image,' Ms Paul said. 'Every girl once in their life has tried a diet or body treatment. You feel the pressure particularly as a female to try these things and look like the people you see in the magazines.' Ms Humphreys told the Herald Sun: 'We’re both passionate about the beauty pressure women put themselves under and how girls our age are trying to create the perfect female form. 'We wanted to unpack what the myths were for ourselves and the audience and the most honest way was to go through it and experience it for ourselves.' She said sitting in a bath of ice to burn calories and speed up her metabolism was the craziest thing she has ever done. The 19-year-old said the project also resulted in some positive change, with the teenager keen to implement group workouts and CrossFit sessions into her new lifestyle. The documentary is expected to be released in the coming months.

"There’s a lethal weapon in my hand. It might look to you like a bottle of beer. But this one could knock you dead. Called ‘Armageddon’ — the name is no accident — it is the strongest beer in the world. At 65 per cent alcohol, it’s stronger than whisky or brandy and 16 times more potent than a standard pub lager. This 330ml bottle contains 22 units of alcohol — the equivalent of ten pints of Carlsberg. Not for the faint-hearted: Entrepreneur Lewis Shand pours Vincent Graff a glass of the world's strongest beer, Armageddon, at the Brewmeister site in Aberdeenshire . And, like that other famous novelty, the deep-fried Mars Bar (which has just celebrated 20 years since its creation), it’s a gift to the world from the good people of Scotland. Though ‘gift’ is probably not the right word: if you buy this in a shop, it’ll cost £80 a bottle (though you can buy it for half that price direct from the brewery). ‘Go on, take a mouthful,’ says brewer Lewis Shand, the young entrepreneur responsible for the brew. ‘I think you’ll be surprised.’ OK, but I’m not looking forward to it. I’m a bit of a sissy when it comes to strong booze. Though I love my beer and wine, I steer clear of neat spirits, finding their fiery nature rather off-putting. Surely, if Scotch is a mere 40 per cent alcohol, and this beer weighs in at 65 per cent, it’ll rip off the back of my throat? I swirl the liquid round. Thicker than an average pint of bitter, and darker in tone, the beer is the colour of tea with the consistency of a thinnish gravy. Is this a good idea? Vincent appears a little apprehensive as he prepares to drink the strong beer . I take a big, brave gulp. To my surprise, it’s rather smooth. There’s none of the heat or the harshness of neat tequila or vodka; it slips over my tongue and down my throat, lining my mouth with a thick coating. Yes, it is quite bitter — I prefer a milder-tasting ale — but it’s not off the scale. There’s a  definite maltiness and a rather pleasant sweet aftertaste at the centre and back of my tongue. I’m happy to take a second sip. Just curiosity, you understand. And a third, and a fourth. . . I could, I’m sure, empty the glass. Hold on a moment. I think I’d better stop while I’m ahead. So, I ask Shand, why did he decide to brew a beer so potent? Is it something to do with the fact that the Scots consume 20 per cent more alcohol (22.8 units a week) than the English and Welsh? Drink up: Vincent takes a sip as young entrepreneur Lewis Shand watches on . The idea was simple, he says. His young company Brewmeister, set in the Aberdeenshire countryside, had successfully created conventional beers — a tasty 4 per cent pale ale, for example — but wanted to try something more adventurous. Shand is not the first brewer to aim for the world’s strongest beer. In fact, there’s been a battle going on for a couple of years. While it could be seen as an important piece of scientific exploration, others see it as just a bunch of not-quite-grown-up boys who want to be able to shout out to the world: ‘Mine is bigger than yours!’ Three years ago, another British company, BrewDog, also based in north-east Scotland, created Tactical Nuclear Penguin (don’t ask), which came in at 32 per cent alcohol. This threw down the gauntlet. In stepped a German brewer with Schorschbock, a 40 per cent beer. So BrewDog retaliated with Sink The Bismarck, at 41 per cent. The Germans then came back with a 44 per cent brew, only for BrewDog to trump them with The End Of History, at 55 per cent alcohol (though only 12 bottles were ever produced — and each cost £700 and as a gimmick was sold inside a stuffed squirrel). First impressions: Vincent found the ale to be quite bitter but he said it had a rather pleasant sweet aftertaste . Then in July 2010 a brewery in Holland looked to have seized the title — with a 60 per cent beer called Start The Future. Until Shand came along with Armageddon a few weeks ago. The brewer says: ‘We didn’t want just to break the record but to make something that’s got some character to it, something beautifully sweet and malty.’ Yeah, right. In an age of binge-drinking, isn’t it irresponsible to bring out a product as potent as this? Shand says this is not a beer that problem-drinkers will turn to. ‘We’ve designed it for people to consume like a fine brandy, in small amounts, not sitting in a park with a brown paper bag round the bottle. In any case, the price will put off problem-drinkers. These bottles are for sharing.’ So who is his typical customer? ‘People who like something different, who appreciate a fine quality product that’s made in small batches by people who care about what they’re doing.’ (Privately, I think there’s a big market for stag parties.) The Brewmeister brewery is certainly out of the ordinary. Set in a tatty, 200-year-old farm building on the estate of Kincardine Castle, 25 miles outside Aberdeen, it looks out on to the Cairngorms. They use spring water from the estate to make the beer. Inside, there are metal vats and sacks of malted barley, hops and yeast — but it’s clear everything is done on a very small scale: the beer is brewed in batches of just 40 bottles at a time. ‘Though we plan to expand,’ says Shand. It takes some bottle: The world's strongest beer certainly had a powerful effect on Vincent . The place, frankly, is a bit of a mess: there’s an air rifle by the door — in case any rats decide to feast on the large sacks of grain piled against the wall. But Shand is no ordinary brewer. The son of an accountant and an oil executive, he’s still only 26, the same age as his business partner, John McKenzie. The pair launched the business with a £15,000 investment that Shand had amassed at university (‘I started up a paintballing company while I was a student.’) Though the business is still tiny — Shand has a day job with a bank, and McKenzie works off-shore in the oil industry — Shand says they’ve already had orders from ‘Australia, Sweden, America and a lot from  London’. The next batch of Armageddon, which will be ready in a few days, is sold out. 'Lethal weapon': Entrepreneur Lewis Shand holds up a bottle of his 65 per cent strength beer Armageddon for the camera . So what’s the secret of this super-strength beer? The answer is a process called ‘freeze distillation’. Any traditional beer-maker can, with the right choice of yeast, get to a point where the beer is 10 or 12 per cent alcohol. After that, the high alcohol levels . kill off the yeast that is turning the sugars in the malt into more . alcohol, so you can’t get stronger beer using traditional methods. Adventurous: At 65 per cent alcohol, Armageddon is stronger than whisky or brandy and 16 times more potent than a standard pub lager . But Brewmeister’s trick is to cool the beer to zero degrees, when, of course, the water starts to freeze — but the alcohol does not. So if you discard the ice as it forms, making the drink less diluted, what you’re left with is a very alcoholic mixture. But not a fiery one — because the alcohol is still swimming in the malty-hoppy mixture. ‘What we do is the reverse of conventional distillation. When you make whisky, you heat up the mixture and the alcohol evaporates, taking it away from the grain mixture. Then it is condensed and aged in barrels. ‘But we leave the alcohol inside the grain mixture and take the water out. This means the end product tastes much sweeter and less harsh.’ It still qualifies as ‘beer’ since it uses the classic ingredients: water, malted barley, hops. Shand says: ‘We don’t add sugar or rice, rubbish like that, which you sometimes get in lagers.’ This, he insists, is a niche artisan product — albeit an expensive one at £80 a pop. The reason for the high cost? They brew only very small quantities of beer at any one time, and the freeze distillation process means they throw away about 85 per cent of the brew mixture. Plus, ‘about £12 of the price goes straight to the taxman’. ‘We are,’ Shand says grandly, ‘testing the boundaries of brewing.’ Well, I suppose so. The truth is that despite its liver-busting alcohol content, it tastes far better than the tramp’s favourite, Carlsberg Special Brew, which is 9 per cent. Although the taste is nowhere near as enjoyable as that of a conventional real ale. As I leave the brewery, Lewis Shand says: ‘We’re in the process of having the record verified by the people from Guinness.’ With the mention of Guinness, I suddenly feel thirsty — and realise that I’ll be sticking to a more traditional beer.","At 65 per cent alcohol, Armageddon is more potent than whisky or brandy .

The assailant ran off and could not be located after the attack. The federal air marshall, who has not been named, was immediately quarantined and screened on-scene for Ebola virus, 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to the FBI. The federal air marshall did not immediately display any signs of ill health and was allowed to board the flight he was scheduled to work on. No motive: The attack happened in a public part of the airport and the attacker fled and has not been captured . The syringe was recovered and also taken aboard the flight to be tested in the United States. U.S. federal air marshals travel incognito, so the assailant would not have been able to identify the victim as a U.S. federal law enforcement agent from his appearance. 'While there is no immediate intelligence to confirm this was a targeted attack, this is our reminder that international cowards will attempt to take sneaky lethal shots at our honorable men and women abroad,' Jon Adler, the national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said, reports ABC News.","A U.S. federal air marshal was injected in the back of the arm with an unknown substance at Lagos airport .

"Gun enthusiasts are up in arms over a video game. Not over a violent game such as Grand Theft Auto, where players regularly kill prostitutes, shoot innocent bystanders and thieve cars. No, the NRA is fired up over a game based on the beloved animated family The Simpsons. The Simpsons: Tapped Out is a video game for iOS and Android that has proved wildly popular. In a press release from EA, makers of the game, it's described as 'life-ruiningly fun'. Gamers can create their own virtual Springfield, collect characters and go on missions such as 'partying down with the Duff Man at the Duff Brewery' and 'growing Tomacco on Cletus' farm'. Taking aim: Gun enthusiasts are angry at the blatant lampooning of the NRA and gun enthusiasts in the last level of The Simpsons: Tapped Out . So far, so unpolitical. The problem for gun-toting game critics comes when they reach level 30 and get a free content update for the game. According to SimpsonsWiki.net, level 30 is at present the highest level players can reach. At level 30, a storyline involving Herman's Military Antiques store evolves that contains some fairly clear commentary on gun laws in the U.S. and takes some cheap shots at the organization. SimpsonsWiki.net pulled some quotes from the level that has the NRA gunning for the game. 'You’re the perfect gun owner! Step inside!' says Herman to Grandpa Simpson who has just told him how poor his vision and aim are, and how he often mistakes loved ones for intruders. 'Hey, Milhouse, want to go check out the new gun shop in town?' Bart asks Milhouse . 'Of course! After all, the NRA says it’s the safest place for kids,' Milhouse replies. 'They also say us kids should sleep under a blanket made of loaded guns. You know - for safety,' Bart says. Virtual Springfield: Abe Simpson enters Herman Hermann's shop to buy a gun . Too close for comfort: Abe Simpson is sold a gun in the game . Satire: The game's jokes have been deemed boorish by some gamers . 'I eat my cereal every morning with a gun instead of a spoon. Because more guns everywhere means safer kids. Thanks, NRA!' says Milhouse. Police Chief Wiggum: 'I’d like to purchase this AK-47, please. Will you need to run a background check on me?' Herman: 'Of course not. That would infringe on your Constitutional right to never be inconvenienced - even in the tiniest, most reasonable way - when guns are involved.'Wiggum to Apu: 'You do realize it’s now illegal to operate a store that doesn’t sell firearms? It’s all part of the “How Else May We Serve, Oh Wise and Powerful NRA?” Act. You’re going to jail!' Gun control: Police Chief Wiggum buys a gun without a background check in the game . The Simpsons has long used satire as a . means to ridicule elements of society, and it's certainly not the first . time the show's creators have had their characters comment on guns. The . episode Cartridge Family, during which Homer eventually realizes his . folly in buying a gun to protect his family, contains lines such as 'I . don't have to be careful. I have a gun', and this exchange: . Homer: 'I'd like your deadliest gun please.' Clerk: 'Aisle 6 - Next to the sympathy cards' The . show has been more evenhanded than the game appears to be, though: in . that episode, Homer was ejected from the NRA for not following gun . safety rules. The show: In the episode Cartridge Family, Homer acquires a gun . The satire on the show is often . slightly more subtle than that in level 30 of Tapped Out, which is loud . and clear about current gun laws. The . accusation of 'hidden messages' implies there's something secretive or . underhand, or even subliminal in the game's handling of gun issues, . which couldn't be more off-target. Comments about the game on a post on TheTruthAboutGuns.com called 'The Simpsons: Tapped Out Game is Anti-NRA. Very Anti-NRA' express unhappiness with the game's treatment of the NRA. Gtfoxy . wrote, 'Is anyone shocked that these people, who at every turn, bash . all things that are upright & decent[?] They are condecending (sic) of churches, as an example, blapheming (sic) even the almighty God. I . stopped watching this show a long time ago. I’m sorry I ever did to . begin with.' Ralph wrote, . 'The only gun owners I’m afraid of are so-called “adults” who watch . cartoons. C’mon, people. They’re cartoons. They’re supposed to be . stupid.' Level 30: Herman's Military Antiques is the setting for the game's contentious gun statements . Issues: The Simpsons cartoon has always addressed issues in a light-hearted satirical way, without pushing any agenda - unlike level 30 of Tapped Out . It's not known how . much involvement the creators of The Simpsons had with the game, if . any. A forum on the EA site set up for the game has players pondering . the out-of-character indelicacy of the level. '[Is anyone . surprised] at how political this new questline is? The Simpsons, when . political, has always seemed gently so, but this is pretty rough stuff. Not surprised the writers feel this way, just surprised to see it so . nakedly displayed in the game,' wrote shaygitz. cjryder625 wrote: 'this quest is pretty much how people in the UK view the lunacy of the USA's right to bear arms.' According to TheBlaze.com, the game's makers never expected gamers would play long enough to get to level 30. 'Sorry about level 30, guys. If you promise not to gripe to EA too much, . everybody can have three donuts,' Wiggum tells players at the end of level 30.","Games forums and NRA sites are filling up with gun-owners condemning the anti-gun commentary in The Simpsons: Tapped Out .

"Leading British doctors have called for the Government to remove PIP breast implants fitted to 50,000 women following damning new research that shows their shells are faulty. The casings are more likely to degrade than those used in others – leaving women given PIPs at risk of silicone leaking into their bodies, the research showed. The doctors who conducted the research, including nanotechnology professor Alexander Seifalian and top plastic surgeon Professor Peter Butler, now say all PIPs should be removed. Leaking risk: Surgeons operate to remove a PIP implant in France . Nigel Mercer, former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said last night: ‘If you have problems with the outer shell of an implant, then it will act like a sieve and the silicone will just leak out. ‘The batch testing for these implants was useless so we don’t know which women could be most at risk – it’s a lottery. I’d say to women: Have them out.’ The scandal over French-manufactured PIP implants erupted in 2011 when it was shown that they were more than twice as likely to rupture than other implants and that they were filled with industrial-grade silicone used in mattress production. Women whose implants burst have complained of swollen lymph nodes, lumps and pains in their breasts. But despite French authorities agreeing to remove the implants from all women fitted with them as a preventative measure, officials in the UK have continued to insist there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine removal. Instead, the NHS will pay for women to have them removed only if specialists believe that there is  a ‘clinical need’ to do so and if  the private clinics that fitted  them refuse to remove them.  The NHS will not pay to have  them replaced. But the latest research has fuelled further calls for the Government to introduce a blanket policy to remove all PIPs because of the risks. The study examined 18 PIP implants removed from patients between January and March 2012. The researchers, from the Royal Free Hospital  in North London and University College London, tested the strength of the material in the PIPs. The study found the shells were ‘significantly weaker’ than other brands. Toxic fears: A woman calls for fair treatment over implants . Senior surgeons last night said the . study should be taken seriously amid claims that the NHS has been . failing to address the needs of women. Tim Goodacre, a member of the . Government-commissioned panel investigating the PIP scandal and chair of the professional standards committee of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (BAPRAS), said: ‘This is very good research based on good science which gives us a better understanding as to why the shells are rupturing. ‘BAPRAS’s view remains that the PIPs will all need  to come out eventually, like any implant – just not in a short-term rush.’ About 95 per cent of women with PIPs had them fitted by a private clinic, while a minority of operations were carried out on the NHS, mostly for breast reconstruction following cancer. Plastic-surgery chain Harley Medical Group insisted it could not afford to remove implants from patients and recently went into administration to avoid potential legal claims. The French manufacturer of the implants also closed shortly after the scandal broke. The NHS medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, is looking at whether the cosmetic surgery industry needs to be more effectively regulated as a result of the scandal. Jan Spivey, from the PIP Action Campaign, said many women hoping to have their PIPs removed on the NHS were being turned away by GPs or discouraged by specialists. ‘Women’s psychological trauma and needs are totally ignored. Some women cannot afford the high costs of private surgery and are having to live with the terror. It’s totally unacceptable.’ A statement from the Department of Health said: ‘This study has revealed nothing new. Our expert group report, which was published in June, made it clear that PIP implants were more likely to rupture than others. ‘Extensive testing of the PIP gel material has not revealed anything that could cause a long-term threat to human health – they are not toxic and not carcinogenic.’ Shadow Public Health Minister Diane Abbott said: ‘The Government has to put pressure on private companies to remove implants from any woman who requests it.’","Calls for Government to remove all PIP breast implants .

"A range of dolls have been created to defy gender stereotypes and encourage girls to be adventurous, inquisitive and sporty. Lottie is billed as a 'fashion doll with a difference' because - unlike a Barbie doll which has an impossibly slim figure - Lottie has been designed to look and dress like a child. She has the body shape of a young girl and does not wear make-up or high heels. The toy, aimed at three-to-nine-year-olds, was the brainchild of Lucie Follett and Ian Harkin who have developed the idea with their Ireland-based toy company, Arklu. Empowering: The dolls encourage girls to be sporty and inventive like Kawaii Karate Lottie and Robot Girl Lottie . Campaigners such as Let Toys Will Be Toys have highlighted recently how toys have become increasingly gender specific - with girls' products often pink and centred on being a princess or domestic goddess while boys' toys are blue and encourage them to be scientific, sporty and macho. After conducting market research, Arklu found more than half of parents polled believed that toys influence children in their future lives with respect to their education, . careers and lifestyle choices. As a result, 92 per cent felt toys can contribute towards breaking the gender divide and 93 per cent felt it was important that toys help to empower . girls in a fun and educational manner. In response to these findings, Arklu developed six different Lottie dolls, costing £16.99 each, which aim to show girls they can be clever and adventurous and 'do anything men can do'. Real life inspiration: The dolls have been inspired by, from left, international karate star Sensei Debi Steven (Kawaii Karate Lottie), 16th century Pirate Queen Grace O'Malley (Pirate Queen Lottie) and female inventors Erin Kennedy and . Kathy Ceceri (Robot Girl Lottie and the Busy Lizzie . Robot) Some of the range has been inspired by real life heroines, such as Pirate Queen Lottie, who is based on Grace O'Malley. She was dubbed the Pirate Queen during her lifetime in 16th century Ireland. She rejected the traditional role women were supposed to fall into for a life as a warrior on the high seas and once met with Queen Elizabeth . I. An accessories set can be bought for Pirate Queen Lottie that comes with silver coins, a treasure map and collector cards highlighting key events in O'Malley's life, giving girls a chance to learn about history as they play. Meanwhile Robot Girl Lottie and the Busy Lizzie . Robot encourages girls to be scientific and inventive. She was inspired by the story of Allie Weber, an eight-year-old from the U.S. who tried to create a robot from recycled household items for her school science fair, as well as high flying female scientist and inventors such as Erin Kennedy and . Kathy Ceceri. There's also Kawaii Karate Lottie who is a fan of marital arts and encourages girls to be active and bold. She was inspired by Sensei Debi Steven, founder of PeeWee Karate in London. Originally . from South Africa, Sensei Debi represented the Springbok 'all styles' karate team internationally and founded a ground-breaking initiative to deliver free . self-defence classes to underprivileged women and girls in India. Positive play: Other dolls in the range encourage girls to be sporty, brave and kind to nature . Collector cards . for the doll demonstrate karate stances for beginners that children can try. Butterfly . Protector Lottie celebrates science and conservation while Pony Flag Race Lottie is competitive and loves the challenge of racing on her beloved horse. The dolls were first launched in August 2012 with the motto 'Be Bold, Be Brave, Be You' and have received praise from parents and campaigners. Britain's Got Talent judge, Amanda Holden, who has two daughters, admits she is a Lottie fan. She said: 'My daughter (and I!) love her – we're huge fans of her. It’s a brilliant idea to create a positive doll.' MP Jo Swinson, co-founder of the Campaign for Body Confidence, has also praised the product. 'I welcome this . venture which will enable parents to provide their kids with dolls . created with positive body image in mind, and the message that it’s not . all about looks,' she said. Lottie sells in 14 countries and appears in 17 language versions, including Chinese, Russian and Japanese.

"South Africa are steeling themselves to face an England pack regimented by 'one of the best forwards coaches in the world' at Twickenham on Saturday. Springbok forwards coach Johann van Graan hailed England counterpart Graham Rowntree for creating a 'world-class scrum', while calling on South Africa to sharpen up after 29-15 defeat in Ireland. Van Graan revealed boss Heyneke Meyer has led several Springboks fact-finding missions to England, where the two sets of coaches have traded ideas and forged lasting friendships. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree has been praised for his work with England by Johann van Graan . 'Graham Rowntree is in my opinion one of the best forwards coaches in the world and a good friend of mine,' said Van Graan, who doubles as South Africa's attack coordinator. 'The great thing about rugby is the friends you make. We coached against each other for the first time in 2012, what a great guy and what a great coaching staff. 'Just look at guys like Stuart Lancaster, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt; Heyneke and I have visited the northern hemisphere quite a few times in the last year, we've had a few coffees together. 'And like we did with the All Blacks a few weeks ago I'm sure we're going to have a drink before and after the game, talk about their challenges, our challenges, where the game is going, what you think. 'At the end of the day we're much bigger than just ourselves and just this Test match, it's about the game, and what a fantastic coaching group they have, and they are good friends of ours.' Van Graan (left) will cross paths with Rowntree when England host South Africa on Saturday . South Africa dominated territory and possession in Dublin on Saturday but slipped to defeat owing to a host of handling errors and a costly yellow card for replacement hooker Adriaan Strauss. Ireland's physicality and technical nous caught the Springboks out, with Van Graan admitting their refusal to bind on an early maul was a 'shock'. Van Graan believes former Leicester and England prop Rowntree has built a pack that is now the envy of the world under boss Lancaster. 'You've just got to look at the way their forwards conduct themselves on and off the field, the way they prepare, they are always well-prepared at lineout time in attack and defence,' said Van Graan. Van Graan believes Rowntree's (right) efforts have seen England develop a world-class scrum . 'They have a pretty solid maul. They put us under pressure in South Africa two years ago; we played them four times that year. 'It's a world-class scrum and a world-class plan. Whenever we come up against them we know it's a challenge.' South Africa may look to parachute Patrick Lambie in at fly-half to face England ahead of fast-rising star Handre Pollard. Head coach Meyer wants his Rugby World Cup 2015 squad all-but nailed down by the end of the current tour, and is intent on giving opportunities to impress this month. South Africa may start Patrick Lambie (centre left) at fly-half for Saturday's match against England . Van Graan refused to criticise the Springboks' half-back duo of Pollard and Francois Hougaard in Saturday's Ireland loss however. The Springboks do not expect England to change tack to exploit any perceived tactical kicking weakness, especially with Van Graan warning against Danny Care's running game. Widely credited with helping devise South Africa's new expansive play, former Bulls coach Van Graan singled out Harlequins scrum-half Care as one of England's chief threats. 'It would be unfair from my side to single out individuals, as a team we made some errors in Ireland that we've now got to fix,' said Van Graan. Van Graan revealed South Africa  has 'a lot of respect' for England scrum-half Danny Care (centre) 'It starts with the carry and the presentation, and sometimes the half-back gets the criticism when the presentation's not up to scratch. 'There were some individual errors by players but we'll take responsibility as a team and we've got to fix it. 'Twickenham is a place we love to play and this is a Test against a team we really respect. 'We're facing world-class players; we've a lot of respect for Danny Care. 'I don't think they'll pay too much attention to what Ireland did, they will just focus on their game.'","England host South Africa in Saturday's Autumn International Test .

"When President Barack Obama suggested that his wife should spend extra time in paradise as an early birthday present, he was committing U.S. citizens to pay for the gift, whose costs will likely spiral into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The White House conceded on Monday that the federal treasury will foot the bill to fly First Lady Michelle Obama back to Washington, D.C. on a separate government aircraft after she finishes her extended vacation at the palatial 12-bedroom Hawaii home of talk show legend Oprah Winfrey. Dedicated vehicles, Secret Service costs, and security sweeps of the Winfrey estate on Maui will add considerably to the total tab. A Fox News Channel reporter asked White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Monday to clarify who would get the bill for Mrs. Obama's travel, and the spinner landed on taxpayers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mrs Obama joined the president for one public event during a 15-day Hawaiian vacation that she extended after the rest of the family returned to Washington, D.C. on Sunday . Hideaway: Mrs Obama will spend her extra time as a guest of Oprah Winfrey at her mansion in Maui . Talk TV legend Oprah Winfrey will host the first lady for an unspecified number of days in her giant mansion on Maui, where the neighborhood has already become a chaotic mishmash of SWAT teams and security sweeps . 'The first lady stayed behind in Hawaii, and the White House said that was an early birthday present from the president,' noted Fox's Ed Henry. 'Does that mean he's paying for the flight back, or are the taxpayers paying for it?' Carney read from a prepared statement in his briefing binder: 'As with all personal travel, the first family will appropriately fund personal expenses, Ed.' 'And in line with past presidents and first ladies, the first lady will travel via government aircraft, but you are accurate in your description that this was – her decision to remain in Hawaii – the president's suggestion that she remain in Hawaii to spend time with friends ahead of this very big birthday.' Michelle Obama will turn 50 years old on January 17. 'If you have kids,' Carney continued, going off-script, 'you know that telling your spouse they can spend a week away from home is a big present.' 'Not that we don't love our kids.' No FLOTUS sendoff: President Obama took his daughters Malia and Sasha back home without Michelle by his side, and the federal treasury -- not the Obamas -- will pay to bring her back separately . Me time: The president and Sasha and Malia return to the White House without Michelle on Sunday . In addition to the cost of flying a government aircraft from Andrews Air Force Base to Hawaii and back, U.S. taxpayers are on the hook for the cost of Mrs. Obama's Secret Service protection detail – and for any additional security that Winfrey's home and neighborhood might require. TMZ reported Monday that 'security on the island is airtight, with SWAT teams and just about every other resource securing wide perimeters around Michelle.' Her extended stay will likely also require the continued use of several government vehicles, including 'secure transportation' whenever the first lady ventures out of the house, according to a former Secret Service officer who spoke on background. Mrs. Obama likely has a 'standard protection detail,' he told MailOnline, without elaborating on how many agents that would entail or what their services would cost the Department of Homeland Security. 'The flight itself wouldn't be a small passenger jet,' he predicted. 'It would be a larger military aircraft with room in its hold for cars and SUVs, vehicles that otherwise would have come back with the rest of the family.' The big 5-0, but no high-fashion event: Michelle Obama, seen at the 2013 inaugural ball, will host a scaled-down dance party at the White House for her birthday, instead of a mroe typically grand affair . The president's armored SUV, known in Washington as 'the beast,' however, would never have been left behind. 'That vehicle is for the president – just the president,' the veteran agent said. 'She doesn't get to ride in it unless he's there too.' The birthday festivities will continue for Mrs. Obama when she returns to Washington: The White House has sent out invitations for a 'Snacks & Sips & Dancing & Dessert' to be held in her honor, but attendees shouldn't expect a fancy dinner. Guests have been advised 'to eat before you come.' There has been no word on whether the cost savings on food will make up for the expense of bringing the guest of honor back home from Hawaii.","The first lady remained behind in Hawaii following a 15-day family vacation, and will stay at the 12-bedroom island home of Oprah Winfrey .

"A Chinese woman has spoken of her horror at discovering her breast implants had migrated to her back and stomach. Tian Hui, 39, had plastic surgery to enhance her bust in 2002. She had hoped the procedure would boost her confidence after she discovered her husband Chiu, 41, had cheated on her with a younger woman. Botched op: Tian Hui, 39, woke up with one of her implants on her back and the other on her stomach (pictured) Hope: Mrs Tian has the operation in 2002 after she found discovering her husband had cheated on her with a younger woman. She had hoped the surgery would boost her confidence . But more than ten years after the surgery, her implants began moving. Despite her efforts to push them back into place, they continued to move further away from her breasts. Mrs Tian said her confidence hit rock . bottom after her husband’s infidelity and she underwent the surgery in . the hopes of winning back his affections. She . said: ‘I always believed we had a good marriage, at least until I . discovered that he had been having an affair with a woman who was six . years younger than me.’ The couple, . from Guangzhou in China's Guangdong province, had been together for . eight years, setting up a restaurant and building the business together . to make it a financial success. After . she discovered the infidelity they decided to stay together for the . sake of their family, but she still felt she was no longer attractive . enough and decided to have plastic surgery. Bad practice: Despite her efforts to move the implants back into place, they continued to migrate further away from her chest . Nasty surprise: When doctors removed the implants they found the had been made by injecting the now banned substance polyacrylamide hydrophilic gel . Extreme case: Although her implants has been out of place for a while, it was the recent drastic movement of the implants that forced Mrs Tian to have surgery . She . said: ‘I contacted a surgery in the neighbourhood and arranged for them . to make my breasts bigger in the same year. 'But I couldn't believe it . when I woke up one day several years later and realised they had . actually moved.' ‘I was . really embarrassed and tried to hide it by moving them back again. 'But every time I went to sleep and woke up the next day, they had moved. 'And each time it was a further distance than the day before. ‘Eventually . when I woke up one day and found that one of my breasts was on my back . and the other was down by my stomach, I realised I had to do something . and so I checked in for further surgery. ‘I . was actually really scared about the damage that the moving breasts . might have done to my body, and it was incredibly painful.’ Back in shape: Surgeons removed the implants from her back and stomach and replaced them with two new ones . Surgeons . operated on Mrs Tian, removing the moving breasts and putting in new . implants. Liang Hao, a doctor at the General Hospital of the Guangdong Armed . Police, removed the material that had been injected into Tian’s breasts - polyacrylamide hydrophilic gel. He said: ‘This material is poisonous if injected into the body. It can not only do harm to the nerves but also to the kidneys. ‘In extreme cases, it can cause cancer.’ He . said that its usage had been illegal in China since 2006. But the . damage from the moving breasts for Tian was more than just physical. Tian . said: ‘My husband was not impressed and this has become a real problem . between us.

"Controversial: Illusionist Derren Brown has denied reports that his next trick will be to turn a gay man straight . Television illusionist Derren Brown has denied reports that he will turn a gay man straight and make a straight man attracted to men for his latest stunt. The controversial star has made headlines by apparently playing Russian roulette live on television, by 'talking to the dead' in a staged live seance, hypnotising ordinary people to rob a security van at gunpoint and convincing a man the world had been taken over by zombies. But he has said that won't be courting more contention by using mind control to change people's sexuality. Brown, 41, was quoted in The Sun as saying: 'I was thinking about this the other day — it would be interesting wouldn’t it? To take a gay guy and make him straight and a straight guy and make him gay.' But he took to Twitter this evening to deny reports that he will use the concept as the basis of his next show. He tweeted: 'Article in @thesunnewspaper saying that my next show is about changing sexuality: total rubbish. 'Thanks for that, being printed everywhere as fact.' Whatever his next stunt, Brown, who came out as gay in a newspaper interview in 2008, will be hoping that he will see a repeat of the ratings success of his last television special, Apocalypse. The show, which saw him convince Steven Brosnan that the world had been hit by a meteor shower and been taken over by zombies, attracted around 2.3million viewers - making it one of the highest rated Channel 4 shows over the past two years. Brown has never been far from controversy throughout his television career. He was criticised by police after playing Russian Roulette on Channel 4 watched by more than three million viewers in 2003. In 2004 his show Seance, where he brought students from Roehampton University together at Eton Hall, east London, for a seance claiming that a dozen people had killed themselves there in a suicide pact in 1974. Making headlines: Derren Brown has previously played Russian Roulette and performed a seance live on television . The programme received more than 700 complaints, mostly made prior to it airing. Several complaints were also made to regulatory body Ofcom in 2010 following his television special Derren Brown: Hero at 33,000 Feet. The complaints surrounded a scene which saw a man restrained by a straitjacket laying on a railway line. But he said in an interview with Gay Times magazine that making headlines has never been his aim. 'Controversy has never interested me for its own sake. It's always been about doing stuff that feels dramatic,' he said. The illusionist also told the magazine that he has no intention of marrying his long term partner despite proposed changes in the law to allow same sex couples to wed.","Brown, 41, has denied he will use mind control to change people's sexuality .

"A former high school tutor in Michigan accused of having a consensual sexual relationship with a student had a fiery exchange with the prosecuting attorney on Monday in the combative conclusion to a real-life courtroom drama. The weeping defendant Abigail Simon, 35, insisted she was the victim in her relationship with the 15-year-old boy and during one of her aggressive exchanges with Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Helen Brinkman even declared, 'I'll never forgive you!' It was a scene so unusually emotional that even Judge Paul Sullivan was having trouble dealing with it. 'This thing is totally out of control.' the judge told his courtroom. 'I've tried to be patient but I'm beginning to lose it.' Scroll down to watch the heated exchange... Emotional: Accused sexual predator Abigail Simon strikes a pained pose in court on Monday as an emotional exchange erupted between her and prosecuting attorney Helen Brinkman . 'I'll never forgive you!': Simon accused Brinkman's client of lying. Her defense spins upon the argument that she is the victim and was manipulated by a 15-year-old student . Out of control: At one point Simon mouthed 'I want to go home' during questioning. Even the fed up judge declared to the courtroom 'this thing is totally out of control.' 'I want to go home,' Simon mouthed to her attorney at one point as she sat at the stand, the last witness in the two-week courtroom saga. 'Did you tell anybody he forced you or threatened you before you were caught?' Brinkman asked. 'No, I said that 1,000 times already,' Simon said. Arrested: Abigail Simon is seen here in a booking photo after being arrested for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old boy last year . 'I'm not sitting up here lying like your client,' shouted at Brinkman at one point. According to MLive.com, Brinkman accused Simon of 'mirroring' the boy’s victimization as a means of defending herself. The dramatic interaction brought the trial to a memorable close on Monday, with the jury expect to begin deliberations sometime Tuesday. Throughout the proceedings, lawyers for the 35-year-old former tutor are tried to convince a jury the teenager 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' the woman into sleeping with him. The boy, who was 15 when he allegedly had a short but intense fling with Abigail Simon over spring in 2013, would undergo two days of cross-examination. In that time he was pressed on the more than 1,000 text messages exchanged between himself and Simon as the defense attempted to show he was no victim. However the prosecution used the same texts to depict Simon as a predator who went after an innocent virgin, according to M Live. Simon was fired from her position as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic high schools after the boy's mother found pictures of Simon in a garter belt on her son's phone. Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified last week. He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV. ASmiling days before: Simon is on trial for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old male student. Here, she smiles in court days before her trial's dramatic conclusion . The teen - now 17 - said their relationship was consensual and that they both knew it was wrong. One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I’m scared that you’re only 15.' The pair were allegedly together between February 1 and April 26 of last year. Almost all of their encounters allegedly took place at Simon's apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West in Grand Rapids. Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida, Wood TV reported. Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I’m just too old, as much as that stinks.' However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.' The teen started undergoing questioning on Monday November 17. He denied that he slapped Simon before they started having sex with each other and laughed at suggestions he stalked Simon. Simon is charged with first-degree sexual assault and accosting a minor for immoral purposes.

"A new mystery surrounding the disappearance of MH370 emerged today after a police chief claimed he knew what had happened to the Malaysian Airlines jet. The head of the Indonesian Police Force, General Sutarman - who uses only one name - reportedly told a meeting of airline officials and senior police that 'I actually know what had actually happened with MH370,' giving rise to suggestions officials were aware of what caused the Boeing 777-200 aircraft to disappear but have chosen not to reveal the information. His comment was witnessed by representatives of Lion Air and several high-ranking police officers in Jakarta, according to a report by the Indonesian news portal, Kompas.com. Scroll down for video . The Malaysian Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar (pictured), today said he plans to question the head of the Indonesian Police Force, General Sutarman, over his comments . General Sutarman was quoted as saying: 'I spoke to the Malaysian Police Chief Tun Mohammed Hanif Omar. I actually know what had actually happened with MH370,'in front of airline officials and senior police . But in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur today, Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said he was shocked to hear of the comments by his Indonesian counterpart and he was planning to speak to him about the issue. General Sutarman was quoted as saying: 'I spoke to the Malaysian Police Chief Tun Mohammed Hanif Omar. I actually know what had actually happened with MH370.' However, Mohammed Omar retired from the police chief's position in Malaysia in 1994, and that role now being taken by Mr Bakar. It is possible that General Sutarman is aware that Mr Omar had retired but had simply not mentioned that when he referred to him. It is apparent from the current Malaysian police chief's comments, however, that his Indonesian counterpart had not been in touch with him. A full scale search for MH370 is due to get under way soon in the southern Indian Ocean . Mr Bakar told Malaysia's Bernama news agency that he was shocked to learn of the comments because Malaysian police did not have any information about the missing jet. 'I would like to know which media and when such a report was published' said Mr Bakar. 'I will ask my counterpart, whether he had said anything about the issue.' With a full scale search due to get under way soon in the southern Indian Ocean, the search and rescue team (SAR) has found 58 solid objects on the sea bed, Malaysia's Transport Minister, Datuk Seri Lai, said today. A Malaysian vessel, 'Go Phoenix', is expected to arrive in Perth, Western Australia, on September 21 where it will be joined by Australia's 'Furgo Discovery' ship . The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, he said, was in the midst of recovering the objects in the hope that they were wreckage parts from the ill-fated jetliner. 'The Ministry will verify the objects in its effort to draw a sound conclusion,' Mr Liow said today in Kuala Lumpur. A Malaysian vessel 'Go Phoenix', normally used for oil exploration, is expected to arrive in Perth, Western Australia, on September 21. It will be accompanied by Australia's 'Furgo Discovery' ship to search the ocean floor using towed vehicles equipped with sonar and video cameras.","The head of the Indonesian Police Force claimed he knows 'what had actually happened with MH370'

Catherine Powell, 37, who weighed 20 stone, lost half of her body weight in just 16 months thanks to hard work and determination. She is now trying to convince others that they shouldn't resort to NHS gastric bands to lose weight.

"Want to boost your bust in time for your summer break but can't afford to splash out on surgery? British organic brand, Orico, claims to have the solution. Its latest launch is Full Cup Bust and Neck Enhancing Elixir, £27, which is said to add up to 4cm (the equivalent of two cup sizes) to your breasts after just six weeks of use. The elixir's breast-boosting ability is said to be the result of mukul extract; a resin extracted from the bark of the Guggul myrrh tree. Enhancing: Orico say that their Full Bust Elixir can add two to four centimetres to the breasts within six weeks . Groundbreaking: Orico's Full Cup Bust and Neck Enhancing Elixir, £27 . According to Orico, the natural extract . has been clinically proven to have a 're-pulping' or plumping effect on . breast tissue and also helps to fill in wrinkles by increasing lipid . (fat) storage. 'The oleoresin active in Full Cup helps with skin tonicity by increasing lipid storage on the breast,' said a spokesperson for the company. 'It has been clinically proven to re-pulp existing lipid cells so helps the breasts become fuller depending on the level of existing lipid cells after six weeks of use. 'In terms of augmentation I would say no. It can only work with what we have naturally and [is] not like synthetic breast implants that create larger breasts. 'We have also developed a lime and . orange essential oil blend which helps with increasing circulation and . is uplifting aromatherapy, all in a natural light oil base to be used . for massaging the area and to help with skin moisture levels.' The resin has a long history of use, . although more commonly as a perfume ingredient. Called Bdellium in the . Bible, it is similar to myrrh and was a key part of the merchandise on . the caravans that travelled the Arabic Incense Road. Along with its use in perfume, mukul . extract has long played a part in ayurvedic medicine, in particular as a . treatment for obesity. But despite being an effective anti-obesity aid, not everyone is convinced by its claims to increase the size of the breasts. Dr. Roberto Viel of The London Centre of Aesthetic Surgery said: 'These creams are an intensive moisturising system, but as for boosting breast size or plumpness, I don't believe this will have any effect. 'Surgery is the only option if you want firmer or larger breasts, and it can now be done in a number of ways from a very natural effect fat transfer (using fat taken from elsewhere in the body) to breast implants. 'Though these creams have good intent, I do not believe ingredients such as extracts or oils would do much in the way of  plumping breast as creams only penetrate the top layer of skin, though they will, I'm sure, add moisture to the skin.'","Full Cup Bust & Neck Enhancing Elixir can add up to 4cm to your bust .

"Jonathan Cheban was in a Brooklyn courtroom Tuesday following an incident that happened this past summer in a Brooklyn restaurant. Cheban was out enjoying a night of sushi in Brooklyn with some pals and his bodyguard, Saverio 'Sal the Contractor' Carollo, on June 1 when a man started heckling the group. Denis Volchkin, 28, claims he approached the group to speak with a friend he knew and was then told by Cheban to get on his way. Scroll down for video . Drama: Jonathan Cheban (center) appeared in court today with his lawyer, Igor Vaysberg (left) and his bodyguard, Saverio 'Sal the Contractor' Carollo (right) Trouble: Sal (left) was charged with assault following a June incident in which he punched a man who was bad mouthing Cheban (right) Odd turn: The man who Sal punched, Denis Volchkin, was shot dead by police in October after lunging at two officers with a knife . 'He said, 'Get away, you don’t see a scene here, get away from the table',' Volchkin told the New York Post. Then, towards the end of the evening, Cheban overheard Volchkin bad mouthing him to someone over the phone, and a heated argument began. A manager tried to break it up, and then, as can be seen in the surveillance  video, Sal the Contractor punches Volchkin in the eye. He reportedly suffered multiple facial fractures and needed several stitches. Celebrating: Cheban and Sal seemed to be in good spirits as they left the courtroom . All set: The District Attorney moved to dismiss the charges against Sal on Tuesday . BFF: Cheban and his bud Kim Kardashian in Cannes this May . Volchkin then sued the restaurant, sushi miKasa by Kevin, which Cheban is a partial owner of, for leaking a tape of the incident to TMZ. Then, in August, Sal the Contractor was arrested for the incident by police and identified in a lineup by Volchkin. He was charged with assault, which is why he and Cheban appeared in court on Tuesday along with Cheban's lawyer, Igor Vaysberg. The District Attorney ultimately moved to dismiss all charges on Tuesday. This is no doubt partially because of the tragic turn this all took on October 3 when Volckin was shot dead in his mother's Brooklyn home after charging at two police officers with a knife. They had been called to the house, in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, by his mother, Liliya Pilipenko, after he barged in and began choking her following an argument. On his way: There is more drama on the horizon for Cheban, who gets into a big fight with pal Kim Kardashian on this week's episode of Khloe and Kourtney Take the Hamptons . Letting her have it: Cheban tells Kim to 'go fu*k herself' after she accuses him of leaking tabloid stories . In other Cheban drama, the former publicist will be going toe-to-toe with best friend Kim Kardashian on this week's episode of Khloe and Kourtney Take the Hamptons after the girls all accuse him of leaking private information about them to the tabloids. And while no fists will be flying, Cheban does tell Kim at one point, 'go f--k yourself.' Cheban has been palling around New York with Kim's mother Kris Jenner all week though, so it seems that everyone made up in the end.","Jonathan Cheban and his bodyguard Saverio 'Sal the Contractor' Carollo  appeared in a Brooklyn courtroom on Tuesday .

"A handful of active strikers crippled the BBC’s news coverage yesterday despite widespread internal opposition to the walkout. Flagship Radio 4 programmes including Today, The World At One, PM and The World Tonight were replaced with pre-recorded features and short news summaries. National and regional TV news bulletins were hit and BBC Breakfast replaced by Bargain Hunt and Escape To The Country. Scroll down for video . Replacements: Instead of being greeted by BBC Breakfast viewers were instead shown an episode of Bargain Hunt as the newsroom emptied after a strike . Anger: Staff on the picket line outside BBC Birmingham are some of many protesting outside offices nationwide today . Newsnight, which was to have been presented by Kirsty Wark, was replaced by a repeat of Brian Cox’s Wonders of Life. The National Union of Journalists, which called the action in protest at compulsory redundancies, insisted it was well supported. But the union was unable to provide figures on how many BBC staff joined the walkout and only a dozen strikers manned a picket line outside the Corporation’s Broadcasting House in central London. All had left by 5pm. Picket: Journalists at BBC Scotland are also on strike over job cuts, disrupting programmes throughout today . Plea: A National Union of Journalists, NUJ, placard taped to a post outside BBC Television Centre in White City, London, but very few people were protesting at its doors . Absent: Presenters Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid were not on the air today after a strike meant BBC Breakfast was cancelled . Workers at the Department for Education have voted to go on strike in a row over spending cuts and job losses. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union backed walkouts by almost 2-1, and other forms of industrial action by nearly 9-1. The union said it believed Education Secretary Michael Gove is using the department as an ideological test-bed for wider civil service cuts. Around 1,000 jobs are under threat because of spending cuts, said the union. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'These cuts are purely political and would not only mean misery for 1,000 of Mr Gove’s own staff but also put at risk some vital public services, such as ensuring children are safe at school and supporting special educational needs.' The union said turnout in the ballot was 37.5 per cent. Officials accused the department of using management consultants to draw up plans to axe more than a quarter of its workforce. A Department for Education spokesman said:  'We want this country to have the best education system and the best children's services. To achieve this we must create a department that delivers an excellent service to the public, while ensuring value for money for the taxpayer.' For most of the afternoon they were outnumbered by about 40 Palestinian solidarity campaigners who hijacked their protest. At the BBC’s new MediaCityUK headquarters in Salford, only ten union officials manned picket lines outside three buildings yesterday afternoon. One journalist on The World At One said: ‘It is an over-the-top reaction for a relatively small number of job losses. ‘But there are so many die-hard Lefties in senior positions at the BBC you can’t afford to get on the wrong side of. ‘So while we might not actually want to strike, some of us are scared to cross the picket line in case we damage our careers.’ According to insiders, the Today programme’s scheduled presenters James Naughtie and Evan Davis did not threaten to strike and were unhappy with the NUJ’s action. But editor Ceri Thomas decided over the weekend to cancel the show because he felt he could not guarantee enough staff would turn up to work. A senior source said: ‘The presenters didn’t have to pin their colours on the mast because the decision had already been taken. ‘The editor simply took the view that it is sometimes better that there’s no programme than one that has been cobbled together. There’s a great deal of unhappiness about the strike. Many, many staff don’t feel it should be dealt with in this way. ‘But it is difficult for people to take a stand against their colleagues and actively break the strike. However, if the NUJ try another one they may well find they are unable to gather enough support to pull it off.’ One senior news presenter at the BBC said of the decision not to air key news programmes: ‘There is no real leadership in BBC news any more. 'People lost their nerve once the strikes were announced. The result has been a shambles.’ Strike: A man enters Broadcasting House in London as BBC journalists started a 24-hour strike today over compulsory redundancies . Casualty: The industrial action meant that the Today Programme, presented by James Naughtie among others, was off the air . David Cameron criticised BBC staff . for striking, pointing out that many of the ‘well-funded’ Corporation’s . employees earn more than his £142,000 salary. The BBC said it was ‘disappointed’ with the industrial action, adding that it would not alter the fact that . it has to make ‘significant’ savings. The Corporation, which is cutting . around 2,000 jobs under its Delivering Quality First programme, said 554 . employees had left as a result of voluntary redundancy, 186 had been . redeployed and there have been 153 compulsory redundancies. The NUJ said 4,000 BBC employees are members but could not say how many joined the strike. BBC News employs 8,000 people. NUJ national executive member Donnacha . DeLong said the BBC’s policy was ‘ridiculous’ because there were many . internal vacancies that could be filled by redeploying staff facing . redundancy.","Staff have gone on strike over compulsory redundancies at the Corporation .

"England head coach Stuart Lancaster is 'optimistic' that Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley will pass concussion tests in time to face South Africa in Saturday's QBE International at Twickenham. The Northampton forwards took blows to the head in the 24-21 defeat by New Zealand, Lawes departing on the first quarter mark and Hartley lasting until the final 10 minutes. The pair will undergo the graduated return to play protocols in place for concussion but Lancaster expects them to have been passed fit by the time he announces his team on Thursday morning. England head coach Stuart Lancaster speaks to the media at the team's base in Pennyhill Park on Monday . 'Courtney is symptom-free so hopefully he will be okay. Dylan has also got bit of a head knock and is in the same situation,' Lancaster said. 'They need to train on Thursday to be ready. They will do a cog Test on Thursday morning which they have to pass to train. 'We will have provisions in place should they fail that, but we are optimistic will be available.' Courtney Lawes (left) leaves the field with a head injury after 20 minutes of England clash with New Zealand . Lock Dave Attwood (knee), wing Semesa Rokoduguni (hip) and centre Kyle Eastmond (illness) missed Monday afternoon's training session but should be involved in the remainder of the week. England are nursing a deep sense of frustration after allowing a 14-11 half-time lead to deteriorate into a fifth successive defeat at the hands of the All Blacks and Lancaster admits no punches were pulled during Monday morning's review. 'The review was honest and pretty straight. We didn't gloss over anything and we know we have got to improve against South Africa,' Lancaster said. Dylan Hartley (right) also left the field with a concussion during his side's bruising 24-21 loss at Twickenham . 'We were up at half-time and deserved to be in that position, but obviously we were pretty hard on ourselves in not taking the opportunities we should have done. 'We know that at this level if you don't take those opportunities they can sometimes come back and hurt you. Clearly that was the case in the second half. 'New Zealand played well in the second half and we didn't play as well. Our kicking game wasn't good enough and put us under some pressure.

"Brian Klose, alleged leader of the 1st SS Kavallerie Brigade Motorcycle Division, the gang set up and then taken down by undercover agents . Police set up a neo-Nazi motorcycle gang to snare white supremacists and racist bikers, including one who allegedly offered a $1,000 reward to anyone willing to murder a black man. After a five-year undercover investigation, prosecutors in Osceola County, Florida, believe they have been able to topple two domestic terrorism groups who were planning attacks on U.S. soil. The probe - involving informants, hidden cameras and microphones, as well as undercover agents - revealed a subculture of neo-Nazi activists who were training and equipping themselves for a race war. Fourteen members of a white supremacist group and five members of a racist biker gang have since been charged with offences ranging from drug trafficking to participating in paramilitary training. 'The underlying aspect through all of it was that they were obtaining explosives and explosives expertise, and they intended to use them to kill people in the United States,' Orange-Osceola State Attorney Lawson Lamar told the Orlando Sentinel. The original investigation began in 2007, with an agent from the Orange County Sheriff's Office trading emails with August Kreis III, a leader of the Aryan Nations hate group. Once one of the country's leading white-supremacist groups, the Aryan Nations, who believe the 'white race' to be an 'endangered species', had been in decline since 2004 after founder Richard Butler's death and lawsuits by the Southern Poverty Law Centre which had depleted its funds. Kreiss wanted to form a neo-Nazi biker club which would serve as the paramilitary arm of white supremacists across the U.S., according to records seen by the Sentinel. Following the email exchange, an undercover agent from Orange County became the Aryan Nations' top Florida recruiter for what would become the 1st SS Kavallerie Brigade Motorcycle Division. Early members of the gang included two undercover FBI agents, who used their knowledge of explosives to gain the trust of others, and a biker who allegedly offered $1,000 to anyone who shot a black man riding an ATV in rural Osceola County, according to records seen by the Sentinel. Kreis came to central Florida in 2008 to meet his new followers after Brian Klose, a 6ft 6in enforcer with the Outlaws Motorcycle Club, became the Kavellerie Brigade's new 'fuhrer'. A CCTV feed from FBI hidden cameras in the Kavallerie Brigade clubhouse, which was used to gather evidence against members of the group . The investigation into the group underway, the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force installed a range of bugs and hidden cameras into the Kavallerie Brigade's clubhouse in St Cloud, Osceola County, allowing them to begin collecting the evidence they would use to snare any members suspected of illegal activity. Unaware of the covert recording equipment tracking his every move, Klose warned members to be wary of anti-terrorist legislation like the post 9/11 Patriot Act, which gave police extensive surveillance powers, and to never admit their membership of the Kavallerie Brigade. However, Klose never suspected that his own in-house explosives experts were in fact undercover agents and he asked them repeatedly to build bombs and hand grenades for planned attacks, records show. And footage obtained from the many cameras concealed in the Kavallerie Brigade clubhouse enabled officers to gather the evidence to put together drug-trafficking charges to arrest members. A still from CCTV footage of Kavallerie Brigade members apparently carrying out a cash transaction: Three members of the gang now face drug trafficking charges . The investigation broadened in the spring of 2010 when central Florida's Joint Terrorist Task Force began looking at the American Front, another white supremacist group rumoured to be conducting paramilitary training in Osceola County in preparation for a race war. With no undercover officers inside that organisation, the investigation relied on a former drug dealer who had turned over to act as a confidential informant for the authorities. By late summer 2010, he began hanging out at the 10-acre American Front compound in Holopaw, owned by the group's alleged leader Marcus Faella, where he joined members shooting AK-47s at water-filled jugs which represented the heads of blacks and Jews. Among a range of racist behaviour, the informant told how Faella traded a motorcycle for a plot of land where a young black man had been killed, burned and buried in 2010 in a racist murder unconnected to the American Front or its members. Members of the gang used the murdered man's desecrated grave as a urinal, records show. Paramilitary training: A still taken from hidden camera footage shows a member of the American Front firing an AK-47 at their Osceola County compound . Armed and dangerous: A member of the American Front brandishes an AK-47. The group were thought to be in training for a hoped-for future race war . The informant continued passing information to authorities until this May when, fearing his cover was blown and his life in danger, he dialled 911 while in a Melbourne cinema where he had gone with American Front members. Arrests of 14 members of the group began then and continued through June. Following their arrests Mr Lamar and Kelly Boaz, an Orange County deputy sheriff assigned to the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation who was the lead agent in both investigations, both received death threats. Almost all the 14 arrested members of the American Front were initially held in lieu of $500,000 bail on charges of participating in paramilitary training evidencing prejudice and planning to shoot into an unidentified building, according to the Sentinel. Racist ideology: Fourteen members of the American Front were arrested and charged in May and June this year . The investigation into the Kavallerie Brigade continued until March 29 this year, but law-enforcement agencies have kept back much information about the group's activities for the past two years. The FBI told the Sentinel it would not comment while cases remain in court. While six people were initially arrested in connection with the case, charges against one were subsequently dropped. Three of the four remaining members arrested face bomb and drug-trafficking charges while would carry mandatory sentences of 25 years in prison if convicted. The fourth Kavallerie Brigade arrestee faces bomb charges and a charge of solicitation to commit first-degree murder. 'We decided to strike against the Kavallerie Brigade by bringing these heavy-duty drug charges to shut the active members down,' Assistant State Attorney Steve Foster told the Sentinel. 'We are going to remove them from the community,' he added. Pretrial hearings for some of the defendants in both cases begin this week.","Authorities say undercover operation toppled two domestic terrorist groups .

"Confident: Minnie's made it in Hollywood and she is happy in her life at the moment . Owning huge, over-excitable labrador puppies was all it took to teach Minnie Driver how to control the men in her life. Training both requires the same skills says Driver, the British actress who captivated Hollywood in films such as Good Will Hunting. Forget over-analysing, says the Oscar-nominated star, who insists it is the trait in women men find most difficult to deal with. The solution is much more simple. ‘The best training I ever received in my understanding of boys – and of grown men, too – was having labradors,’ she says. ‘Dogs need three things. They need to run a lot, to be fed a lot, to be loved and taken care of a lot – and that’s it. If you can cover those three bases, you’re good to go. ‘We women tend to forget that and try to over-complicate relationships with men, which we should never do because they are very simple creatures – not simple as in stupid, but simple in the best way, meaning straightforward and pragmatic. ‘Boys are simple and lovely and uncomplicated, and we women do best when we remember that.’ It’s fair to say Driver knows what she is talking about, even though it has been a lesson learned a little late in life. Happily single at the moment, she has dated a host of stars and her background is littered with broken relationships. Matt Damon once famously ditched her ‘live’ on the Oprah Winfrey TV show, and her love affair with Josh Brolin, to whom she was engaged, ended in acrimony when his stepmother, Barbra Streisand, commandeered the couple’s wedding plans. These days the only men in Driver’s life are her son Henry, five, and his father, TV producer Timothy Lea. Although she and Lea are no longer romantically involved, they live close to each other near Universal Studios in Hollywood, and Henry divides his time between them. And while some women long for a daughter to play dolls and dress up with, Minnie says she can think of little worse. ‘I’m so grateful I don’t have a girl because when I was young I put my parents through hell. I was conniving, manipulative, emotionally challenged – you name it.’ But for all that, she is proud of how . her parents brought her up and is determined to ensure Henry grows with . the same values and manners her mother instilled in the young Driver. Table manners, she says, were drilled into her as a child. Happily single at the moment, she has dated a host of stars, including Matt Damon who ditched her on Oprah . Her understanding of men was partly informed by her love affair with Josh Brolin, to whom she was engaged. It ended in acrimony when his stepmother, Barbra Streisand, commandeered their wedding plans . That is why she is equally insistent Henry never misbehaves at the table. ‘I think we English eat more politely than Americans, so I insist that he eats nicely,’ she says. ‘I’m generally a very relaxed parent in that he can wear what he wants and he knows that he’s entitled to his own opinion about lots of things. ‘But I am a stickler for good manners when he’s around food. His American friends have a burger in hand, they’re dropping ketchup all over the furniture, eating with their mouths open, sometimes  standing on a chair, and I don’t put up with that with Henry.’ As a result, she says, people are starting to notice his excellent table manners. ‘Boys are simple and lovely and uncomplicated, and we women do best when we remember that’ ‘My friends’ kids are sent to my house to learn how to eat! Their parents say, “Can you make my kid have good manners like Henry?” I say, “Sure, send them round here to dinner.” 'I think British parents have to be stricter than Californians about things like this because when you’re living inside so much as we do in Britain you have to learn to behave. ‘You don’t have as much space, you can’t let the kids go and work all their energy out outside and when you sit down to eat you’re inside the house, not in the garden. ‘So I suppose we have the rain to thank for our good manners!’ Now 44, Driver is fast approaching the dangerous age when actresses begin to count their wrinkles and bemoan their sagging bodies. Not that Driver has much to worry about on that score. Just last year she was  pictured in the Caribbean looking lean and toned in a tiny bikini. Relaxing: Minnie received an onslaught of criticism about her body when this image emerged of her in the Caribbean . Body confident: She responded by posing naked for Allure Magazine, adding she is healthy and happy . And when Twitter trolls posted unpleasant comments about her fabulous figure, Driver retaliated by posting a nude photograph of herself. ‘I was surprised by that bullying – it came out of nowhere and I thought it was weird,’ she says. ‘But if you’re going to start bullying people who are confident and OK with themselves, then those comments reflect more on the crazies sitting behind their computers doing that stuff, than on me. ‘I have a very good body image, and always have had.’ And neither is she afraid to allow her body to suffer for her art. For her first film, Circle Of Friends, she happily piled on 2st. ‘I have always felt good about the shape I am in. I’m very healthy – a lot healthier than a lot of younger actresses that I come across these days who seem to feel a huge lot of pressure to stay very slim indeed.’ Driver is currently starring  in About A Boy, a US TV series based on Nick Hornby’s novel. ‘These days, I’m just happy to be still working and I’m grateful that I’m still here and I’m healthy and that I’m  not crazy. ‘And that means I’ve sort of survived. I’m not without scars, but I’ve survived.’","British actress said three dogs is best training for relationships .

"It would seem to be the perfect getaway for Downton Abbey fans wanting to sample first-hand the sumptuous aristocratic lifestyle depicted in the hit drama. For the first time in its 172-year history, Highclere Castle, where the series is filmed, is offering guests the chance to stay the night – for £500 a time. However, despite the wallet-busting fee, fans will not get to stay in the imposing 19th Century stately home familiar to millions of ITV viewers, but in a remote gatehouse a mile down the road. Cosy: The gateway house is a mile up the road from Highclere Castle, made famous on the ITV series . Nor will they get to sample lavish feasts served up by obliging, well-mannered below-stairs staff in the mould of fictional butler Carson – as the accommodation is strictly self-catering. Highclere’s owners, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, have built the guest quarters in London Lodge, the castle’s Georgian Grade II-listed gatehouse, perched at the top of the mile-long driveway which leads to the famous front door. It was built by the first Earl of Carnarvon in 1793, but had been left disused for decades. Now, after two years of restoration, it is expected to open this summer, with guests able to rent it for up to two nights. Lady Carnarvon told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s a new step for me. We will welcome people from all over,  I expect. Access is going to depend on the time of year. It will be cosy, charming and unique. A new step: Lady Carnarvon has opened the doors to the Highclere gatehouse left disused for decades . Self-catered: Guests paying £500-a-night will not be treated to service like the show's stars receive from Carson, Mrs Hughes and Miss O'Brien. Their stay will be strictly self-catered, it has emerged . ‘It’s exciting bringing back to life an old, sad building and again giving it purpose. It is a new departure  for us to try short lets and we hope it will amuse people. ‘I hope to suggest some walks around various paths in the estate as well as suggesting local pubs.’ The castle is already immensely popular with visitors, particularly Americans, many of whom visit Britain specially to take in the stunning grounds. Currently there is a long waiting list to marry there, with each wedding earning the estate £15,000. And Lady Carnarvon will, no doubt, encourage her overnight guests to head to the gift shop after they have signed the visitors’ book. If guests want to get a glimpse of the opulent interior, they will have to book a wedding for £15,000 . The Countess has revealed she will soon be releasing her third book about the house, a cookbook called Dining At Highclere Castle: The Real Downton Abbey. Recipes, Etiquette And Anecdotes. ‘I’m hard at work so we can rush it out for the Christmas market,’ she said. Lady Carnarvon and her husband Geordie were burdened by the high expense of running a stately home before their friend Julian Fellowes wrote the series, with Highclere in mind, for ITV in 2010. Reports at the time suggested £1.8 million of urgent repairs were needed to keep Highclere going after it had been ravaged by damp and rot. At least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and its stone turrets were falling into disrepair. Lady Carnarvon added: ‘Downton has helped our marketing in an extraordinary way and has meant we have been able to tackle various projects earlier than otherwise because of the increased tours and visitors. And I suspect the effects from Downton will still roll out over the next 20 years.’","First offer for guests to stay in 172-year history of Highclere Castle .

"For the past seven days Kate Leaney, 27, a committed Christian, has attracted curious looks on the street. That's because she has been wearing a hijab everyday in an act of 'love and solidarity' with her many Muslim friends. Recently, mates of the asylum seeker worker, who is from Adelaide, have said they are scared to wear the head-dress in public. Their concerns followed incidents in the past few weeks involving alleged terror suspects as well as a rise in reported anti-Islamic attacks. 'After the news I saw on TV, i don't want to tell people I'm a Muslim!' one friend texted Ms Leaney. 'i think Australians don't like Muslims!' So last week she decided to take a stand, don the headscarf and send a message of 'love over fear'. Scroll down for video . Dramatic message: Kate Leaney, the manager of the Welcome to Australia centre in Adelaide, has donned a hijab for the past seven days. Ms Leaney (pictured) decided to wear a hijab for the past seven days to stand in 'solidarity' with many of her Muslim friends who are worried about recent anti-Islam incidents. Mates: Kate Leaney, pictured, with a couple of her Muslim friends who wear the hijab. Text scare: Ms Leaney (right) heard from a number of her friends (for instance, the text message pictured left) who said the news lately had made them afraid to go out in public wearing a headscarf. On the seventh day of wearing her headscarf, Ms Leaney today told Daily Mail Australia that it had been an interesting, although sometimes confronting, experience. On the one hand, the reaction from her friends was 'overwhelmingly positive'. Many friends who wore a headscarf thanked her for her efforts. 'I was getting messages from (my friends)...They were fearful of retribution or getting racially attacked and I wanted to do something,' Ms Leaney said. 'It wasn't so much about educating the public but standing in solidarity with my friends who are Muslim and showing them they should be able to walk in public and feel safe.' ' 'There's a real sense of gratitude for someone who doesnt identify as Muslim wearing it. Most of the reaction has been overwhelming and positive.' Ms Leaney said one the best examples was when the mother of one of her friends, a Muslim woman in her 40s who speaks very little English, was heartened by her actions. 'She's worn a headscarf for her entire life and for the first time has considered taking it off, because of what it would result in.' 'His heart was breaking for his mum... Him telling her what I was doing for the week had given her a little security or hope she could continue to wear it.' But it wasn't all smooth sailing. She experienced many of the negatives women who wear the hijab experience in Australia -  particularly, an underlying sense some people felt suspicious of her. 'I have had looks and seen people looking really uncertain... or I get a feeling someone is not happy with it (the hijab).' Selfie: Ms Leaney, a Christian, checked with her Muslim friends to make certain that her protest was not offensive to them. She said she has received 'overwhelmingly positive' feedback from her friends. Without a hijab: Ms Leaney (right), pictured with one of her friends who wears the Islamic head-dress. Now with headdress: Ms Leaney with one of her friends. Cultural exchange: Ms Leaney, far left, poses for a photograph with two of her friends. Some people were more blatant. A petrol station worker quizzed her about the hijab, asking: 'Why would you wear that, when you look like them?' Ms Leaney faced hostility from some people in the Christian community. She has copped abuse on social media. A mother and her daughter even crossed the road to apparently avoid her. 'It could have been a coincidence, but there seemed to be no other reason,' Ms Leaney said. 'Simply because of a piece of fabric on my head, when if I wasn't wearing it she probably would have engaged me in a conversation or dialogue'. And despite being the type of person who 'always' gets stopped by security at the airport, she said she faced the most intense security check of her life greeting a friend at Adelaide Airport. The search included her hijab, her clothing and in the depths of her bag. 'I can't read too much into it, but it was definitely interesting,' she said. A spokeswoman for the Australian National Imams Council this week said a passerby allegedly ripped a hijab from a woman's head this week. Other Islamophobic incidents included a pig's head being placed on a cross out the front of a mosque and car in south-west Sydney vandalised with graffiti which said: 'F---N' MUSLIMS'. Suspect: Numan Haider (pictured), 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers and was then shot dead in Melbourne's south east on Tuesday. Police described Haider as a 'terror suspect' who had came to their attention three months ago. Attack: This car was allegedly graffitied by anti-Muslim vandals in recent weeks. Massive operation: Australia witnessed the largest counter-terrorism raids in the country's history earlier this month. Fifteen men were arrested, and two eventually charged, following an operation which involved 800 police officers in New South Wales alone. These incidents occurred following the release of a number of beheading videos by the Islamic State terror group, the largest counter-terrorism raids in Australia's history this month, and the stabbing of two police officers by Numan Haider, 18, in Melbourne's south-east. The chief religious leader of the Islamic community, Grand Mufti Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammed, condemned the Islamic State's 'fatwa' against Australians and other Westerners earlier this week and many Muslims have joined a viral worldwide phenomenon where they have taken pictures of themselves holding signs saying the actions of the Islamic State were  #NotInMyname. Ms Leaney said her experience reminded her that many Islamic women often encounter distrust and suspicion wearing the hijab. 'I have had a few negative moments, and that was always bound to happen,' Ms Leaney said. 'I think it highlights for people who are hijabis, they experience this everyday, not just the week I decided to wear this,' she said. 'That's their everyday life.'","Adelaide woman Kate Leaney, 27, has worn a hijab for the past seven days .

"Britain has long enjoyed a love affair with all things French, from wine to high fashion. Now cosmetic surgery is being transformed by the introduction  of the ‘haute couture’ boob job from France. It means every enhancement can be unique instead of simply  a choice of cup size. A new range of implants with 600 possible variations gives women a bewildering choice  of gels, shapes, textures and volumes from the very large  to the conical. Scroll down for video . Posh boobs: Victoria Beckham, pictured at Wimbledon with husband David, has reduced her surgically enhanced chest twice since first getting 34DD implants, and is now a natural looking 34A . Like all implants, they are each hand-made by a small team of highly skilled workers. And instead of the trend to just make breasts bigger, the effects of surgery can be far more subtle. The range capitalises on a new desire for more discrete surgery, exemplified by the ‘has-she-or-hasn’t-she’ looks of Victoria Beckham and Catherine Zeta-Jones. And for the first time the implants are being marketed directly to women, rather than just surgeons, as consumers have become more clued up following the PIP scandal. Plastic surgeons say the choice reassures those left anxious after up to 47,000 women in Britain were fitted with defective implants made from industrial-grade silicone. Women can have much more control over their operations, and the implants come with a lifetime guarantee. Inspiration: Women want their breasts to look like Catherine Zeta-Jones's . Consultant plastic surgeon Jonathan Staiano, of Staiano Plastic Surgery, said: ‘There  is now a matrix of implants,  in lots of different widths, profiles and shapes. 'You get a result that is tailored to your body. And the internet is changing everything. Women know exactly what they want and can get it. 'It’s the end of the days  of walking into the surgeon saying “I want a boob job” and them replying, “Yeah OK, sign this illegible consent form and we’ll sort you out.” No two boob jobs will be alike.’ The new Eurosilicone range  has been introduced by GC Aesthetics, which already owns  UK-manufactured implant Nagor. It has a ‘Matrix’ line which offers nine types of implants that generate 102 possible variations, and another ‘Round Collection’ that has a further 219 variations. The Nagor range offers another  270 different possibilities. Boob jobs are the most popular form of plastic surgery, and the number of UK operations rose by 13 per cent in the past year. Consultant reconstructive surgeon Ali Juma, of Breast Augment Limited, said: ‘A few years ago the implant choice was around a finite number of volumes and a single shape. Now I have a 20- to 30-page manual full of choices.’ Mr Juma said there is now  a generational divide with younger women wanting bigger breasts but older women on their second or third boob jobs seeking a more natural look. Lara Chandler, 31, a fitness instructor from Ashford in Kent, had her first augmentation ten years ago. She said: ‘I just walked into the clinic and said, “I want to be bigger, give me massive boobs”– as you  do when you’re young. I went from a B cup to a D. I loved it, but then I grew up and they started to really get in the way. Now I’m going for something much more natural.’ Ayse Kocak, chief executive of GC Aesthetics, said: ‘A woman should be able to work with her surgeon to select  the shape, volume and projection that most suits her individual wishes.’","For the first time implants are being marketed directly to women .

"At first glance these beautiful images appear to show a frozen river caked in fresh snow. But these photographs actually reveal the shocking extent of pollution of the Yamuna River in India that has caused a thick layer of foam to completely cover it. Parts of the Yamuna are now described as a 'dead river' meaning the pollution level is so bad that there is not enough oxygen in it for fish or other marine life to survive. Scroll down for video . Taking a bubble bath: A Hindu devotee offers prayers after a dip in the Yamuna River, surrounded by industrial waste, during the religious Karthik Purnima ceremony in New Delhi, India . Diving in: This Hindu doesn't seem to mind the foam caused by industrial and residential waste . Taking a dip: Hindus traditionally bath rivers to offer their prayers as part of the Kartik Poornima ceremony . But that didn't stop one devoted Hindu going for an industrial bubble bath to mark the Karthik Purnima religious ceremony celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu calendar month of Karthik. Other worshippers can be seen making their way through the foam on small wooden boats or carrying out prayers by the water's edge. The images show poor water quality of the Yamuna despite efforts by the Indian government to rectify the situation. India has spent almost £200 million on unsuccessful schemes to clean the river, which is revered by Hindus and still plays an important role in many religious ceremonies. Most of the pollution is centered around Delhi where 18 drains dump 600 million gallons of sewage in the river every year. As well as industrial waste from local factories, locals also wash their clothes and utensils in the river. Field of ice: At first glance, it appears these Hindus are crossing a frozen river . Steady now: Worshipers make their way to shore after travelling across the foam-coated Yamuna river . Fireside: Groups of Hindus light candles and small fires by the side of the river as part of the ceremony . A 600km stretch of the river surrounding Delhi has been declared dead - similar to the Thames 55 years ago before efforts were made to clean it up. The Yamuna's polluted stretch was about 500km - from Wazirabad in Delhi to Juhika in Uttar Pradesh - according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s 2010 data. But latest data show the pollution now starts from Panipat in Haryana, almost 100km upstream of Wazirabad. Scientists have also recently raised concerns about the risks of the river infecting food produce grown nearby with an insecticide called Lindane, widely used in mosquito repellents. If not washed properly before being cooked, the chemical can remain in the vegetables and fruits grown on the river's floodplains and enter the human body. Residents of settlements along the river who use the contaminated water for washing, cooking, bathing and drinking, continue to be susceptible to diseases.

Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is absent. Cities are aflame, there are torture chambers, demons and mutated animals feeding on mangled humans. Writer Walter S. Gibson said that explosions in the background are ‘turning the water below into blood’. The foreground is populated by a variety of distressed or tortured figures. Some are crucified by harps and lutes to sharpen the contrast between pleasure and torture. The ‘tree man’ has three naked people in his hollow torso and the image is thought to suggest sexuality and lust, which in the Middle Ages were seen by some as humanity’s fall from grace and the deadliest of sins. However, Amelia wrote on her blog: ‘Just wanted to let people know that there are indeed errors in the transcription and this is indeed not a very good recording (I threw this together in 30 minutes at one in the morning,) but I’m working with the music department at my college to get the transcription more accurate!’ Bosch painted his three part masterpiece between 1490 and 1510 when he was around 50 years old. It is his most famous work. Art historians and critics have largely interpreted the painting as a warning on the perils of life's temptations, but there have been other strange interpretations over the centuries as to what it could all mean. Hell is the setting for a number of Bosch’s paintings and in this one, humans have succumbed to the temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The picture is a chilling one and humans are warring and held in torture chambers, pursued by demons and feasted on by mutated animals that feed on human flesh. Interestingly some of the tortured souls trapped in hell are shown to be crucified by harps and lutes so that the music of the underworld is the opposite of that on Earth and certainly in heaven. Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch's paintings are packed full of vivid imagery and complex meanings. And The Garden of Earthly Delights (pictured) which depicts the Biblical narrative of creation, heaven and hell is one of his most intricate .","The tune is pictured on the posterior of a tortured male in The Garden of Earthly Delights painting by the Dutch master .

"Thousands of British women fitted with faulty breast implants face further agony after a clinic at the centre of the scandal deliberately went into administration to avoid a possible multi-million-pound legal payout. The Harley Medical Centre faced legal claims from 1,700 women who suffered pain and distress after being fitted with defective PIP implants. But last week, the cosmetic surgery chain appointed administrators after its management complained that legal action could put the firm out of business. Outrage: Protesters targeted the Harley Medical Group premises over the scandal . The Mail on Sunday has learned the group has transferred all of its doctors and clinics to a new company to allow it to continue performing cosmetic treatments – but without the threat of legal action by the damaged women. It was revealed last year the French-made PIP implants could rupture and leak industrial-grade silicone into the body. There were fears the substance could be toxic and cause cancer, although there is no evidence for this so far. Last night there was cross-party support for an investigation into the company's actions. Health Minister Lord Howe said: 'It is extremely disappointing that the Harley Medical Group has chosen to do this. 'All medical practices have a duty of care towards their patients, which should include appropriate compensation if treatments go wrong. We will be looking into this as a matter of urgency.' Still operating: Harley Medical founder Mel Braham with specialist cosmetic surgery nurse Penny Timberlake . Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said he would today write to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to ask for the Care Quality Commission and General Medical Council to look at the issue. Mr Burnham said: 'It's an example of capitalism at its most irresponsible and unethical. It's a straight-forward breach of the duty of care that any doctor – public or private – owes to a patient. 'It raises questions about their fitness to practise. All avenues should be explored, including an appeal to the CQC in terms of their registration, and to the GMC in terms of whether any practitioners have broken professional codes. To wash their hands of this is not acceptable.' Harley Medical Group, set up in 1984 by Australian entrepreneur Mel Braham, has played a controversial central role in the PIP scandal. The chain supplied more of the implants than any other UK firm, fitting them in 13,900 women between 2001 and 2011. Manufactured by French firm Poly Implants Prothese, which went into liquidation, the rupture rate was far higher than for other implants, and some contained non-medical silicone normally used in mattress production. Faulty: Defective silicone gel breast implant manufactured by Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) removed from a patient . The Government agreed to remove and replace those that the NHS gave to 3,000 women, and claimed private clinics had a 'moral duty' to offer the same service. However, in January, chief executive Mr Braham announced the company could not afford to meet the cost and claimed the Government should foot the bill. Many of Harley Medical's patients complained they could not get through to the company by phone,  while the firm said it would only remove for free those implants that had ruptured. The NHS has treated nearly 900 of Harley Medical's patients, 134 of whom need the implants removed, after claims the company would not help them. Documents filed at Companies House reveal Aesthetic and Cosmetic Surgery Ltd was set up in September with the same directors as Harley Medical Centre and based at the same address near Harley Street. It will still be called Harley Medical Group and Mr Braham remains chief executive. His daughter Louise and her husband Pierre Guillot are fellow directors. Banned: The Harley Medical Group's advert for breast enlargement which was outlawed by the Advertising Standards Authority . Mr Braham, 71, a multi-millionaire who made his fortune from macadamia nuts, lives in a £1.6 million riverfront apartment in West London. On Thursday the London Gazette revealed administrators Leonard Curtis had been appointed by the company on November 9. Daniel Yea, from Maitland Communications, acting for the company and the administrators, said: 'They are still functioning as before, still providing surgery and honouring bookings. 'It's the same directors, surgeons, premises and website but under a different holding company. 'The liabilities will not be transferred. The liabilities resulting from the class action die with the previous company. 'Women scheduled to have PIPs removed by Harley Medical will still have that done. The only difference is that legal claims against Harley Medical Centre will no longer be able to take place.' There are 3,000 women involved in a PIP class action, being led by solicitor Mark Harvey at Hugh James. The majority are taking action against Harley Medical. Bankruptcy: The Harley Medical Group deliberately went into administration to avoid a possible multi-million pound legal payout . A legal source said: 'Lawyers are in discussions with administrators with a view to exploring the other remedies that are available. 'Women who have paid for surgery with a credit card will be able to pursue claims against their credit card companies. 'And it may still be possible to take action against individual doctors rather than the clinic.' A spokeswoman for Official PIP Campaign UK said: 'The company has failed to ensure the victims are suitably compensated so that women can draw a line under this distressing situation.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients' Association, added: 'It's deceptive and deceitful and it's letting patients down.' A spokesman for Harley Medical Group said: 'Harley Medical Group has always put patient care at the heart of everything we do. 'Moral duty': Mel Braham said the company could not afford to meet costs of removing and replacing implants . 'The situation with PIP implants wasn't of our making; it arose as a result of a sophisticated fraud by the suppliers of these implants, perpetrated over a long period of time that went undetected by regulators for 12 consecutive years. 'In response to this we have acted in the best interest of our patients and we will continue to do so. Despite being a victim of this fraud, we were faced with liabilities arising from a class action we simply wouldn't have been able to survive. 'That's why we took the decision that it was in the best interest of our patients that we restructure our business, allowing us to continue to care for patients who have medical issues arising from PIP implants, and to continue the rest of our business as normal.' Mother of three Kim Purser, right, felt 'completely let down' by Harley Medical Group after she had PIP implants fitted in July 2009. After the scandal broke, the administrator, 36, from Taunton, Somerset, discovered her implants may have been leaking and paid £3,500 to have them removed at another private clinic after finding Harley Medical 'wasn’t interested'. Let down: Kim Purser, 36, was part of the class action against Harley Medical Clinic, which fitted her PIP implants in 2009 . She said: 'I got a letter this week saying Harley was going into administration. It said that was the end of my claim. I’m angry and gutted. All those weeks of worry and additional surgery was an awful experience. For the rest of my life, I’ll worry what it might have done to me. 'Harley was great when I was paying, but now that the firm isn’t getting money, it’s not interested.'","Harley Medical Centre transfers its doctors and .

"A former Navy SEAL turned prominent TV personality has been charged for allegedly lying about being shot by a random attacker in a mall parking lot. Christopher Mark Heben, 44, has been summoned to appear at Bath Police Department in Ohio today after being charged with obstructing justice and falsification. Police Chief Michael McNeely told MailOnline today despite vast evidence against Heben's claim that he was shot in the stomach following a fight with three men, the veteran maintains he is telling the truth. Heben, who has served in Iraq, Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan, told police in March that he was shot by the driver of a car who   backed into him. Scroll down for video . Former Navy SEAL Christopher Mark Heben, 44, pictured in March, recovering from surgery after having a bullet removed from his abdomen. Police have charged him with falsifying the story he was shot by an unknown assailant in a parking lot . TV star: Chris Heben has made a career for himself by appearing on major news networks to discuss issues of defense and government foreign policy . In a sequence straight from an action movie, Heben said he chased after his assailant and then, realizing he was bleeding profusely, drove himself to a police station to seek treatment. The former SEAL, who makes regular appearances on Fox and CNN, underwent surgery and police launched an extensive search for his attackers. According to News 5, Heben got into a shouting match with three black men in a car which  backed into him in the parking lot of the Mustard Seed Market & Cafe at 5.30pm on March 28 at West Market Plaza in Akron, Ohio. He then continued to the cafe - before turning back to his car after realizing he had left his wallet behind. As he walked across the parking lot, the vehicle pulled alongside him  and Heben realized he had been shot, Bath Township Police Chief Michael McNeely told the Akron Beacon Journal at the time. Heben then jumped into his car and followed the vehicle - a gray sports car with tinted windows - as it drove north and headed to Interstate 77. Realizing he was covered in blood and had been shot, Heben drove himself to the Bath Township Police and Fire Department for help. Heben served as a Navy SEAL for ten years before retiring in 2006. Since then, he had made a career out of media appearances . 'He indicated to us he actually plugged the hole in his abdomen to stop the bleeding as he drove to the station,' McNeely said. He was hospitalized at Akron General Medical Center, where a 'brass projectile' was removed from his abdomen and then the wound was stapled shut. Chief McNeely told MailOnline today that a detective had worked on the case for 30 to 40 hours a week and uncovered inconsistencies between what Heben told the police over several interviews and the media reports he gave. Cell phone records also showed he was not at the mall at the time he claimed the shooting took place. The police followed up on numerous tips that had been called in regarding the assailant's 'gray sports car' - but they led nowhere. Chief McNeely confirmed that Heben did have surgery for a gunshot wound but could not say when it took place - only that it did not happen in the parking lot of the Mustard Seed Market. The chief was also at a loss to explain why Heben would make up such an elaborate lie. McNeely added: 'We have a low-crime, non-violent community and when this was first reported, it caused quite a stir. We want to reassure people that this has been investigated fully and that we remain one of the safer communities in the county.' Heben is currently a spokesman for the Montrose Auto Group in Ohio. MailOnline was awaiting a statement from Director of Marketing, Vinny Maculaitis, on Thursday but he confirmed that the car firm would continue to work with the veteran. Following his alleged heroics at the mall, Heben constantly updated his Facebook group in March with information about his recovery. 'I've been up walking around, yesterday and again this morning,' he wrote on Sunday, two days after the shooting. 'The nurses are telling me to ""take it slow"".....YEAH RIGHT! Navy veteran Chris Heben has been charged after he allegedly made up a story about being shot in the stomach in a mall parking lot in March this year. He is due in court on September 11 . 'The best thing for me to do is to keep my spirits up and to just keep moving! Onward and upward!' He has also uploaded pictures to the Facebook page, which has more than 28,000 likes today, showing his medication and of his abdomen covered with a large bandage. Heben, a father, served as a SEAL for a decade before retiring in 2006. Since, he has worked as a special operations expert on cable news networks and shows. He has appeared on shows that have aired on the History Channel, the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 in the UK. His website says he is the founder of INVICTVS Group, a special operations consortium, and holds a master's degree in physician assistant studies, specializing in sports medicine and emergency medicine. He is also a public speaker and released his first album, The Patriot Project, in the spring. He is due in court on September 11 on the misdemeanor charges. If found guilty he will face a fine but possible jail time. Heben has a prior criminal history. In 2008, he pleaded no contest to three counts of forgery in Ohio and had his physician's assistant license suspended by the Ohio Medical Board for writing up fake prescriptions.","Christopher Mark Heben, 44, to appear at Bath Police station in Ohio today .

"More than two decades have passed since her Dallas heyday as Sue Ellen. And now aged 74, time appears not to have diminished Linda Gray's good looks nor her joie de vivre. The actress, who portrayed an alcoholic wife of devious oilman JR Ewing in the BBC series, prompted a flurry of compliments from the Loose Women panellists as she took her seat at the coffee table of the popular lunchtime ITV show yesterday. Scroll down for video . Linda Gray appeared on Loose Women on ITV yesterday and could easily pass for a woman in her 40s . The former model, pictured, appeared on the 1980s hit TV soap opera Dallas . Miss Gray, who played Sue Ellen in the show attributes her good looks to clean living and avoiding fad diets . Miss Gray, who could easily pass for a woman in her 40s, initially laughed off the questions asking her for the secret behind her glossy hair and youthful skin but later joked: 'I've had a facelift.' The star, who is set to make her pantomime debut as the Fairy Godmother in New Wimbledon Theatre's Cinderella, has often credited her healthy lifestyle for helping her maintain her beauty and slender figure. She confirmed on the show that she walks most days and in the past has said: 'I don't do fad things or diets – they don't work. If you have a -delicious piece of bread and you want it, then have it. 'But don't have it every day. I love dark chocolate but I will have a piece just occasionally. 'It is not about being thin. It is about staying healthy and fit. I need to live a long time to fulfil all the things I want to do. I want to be walking around at 90.' Miss Gray, a mother of two, won numerous awards for playing JR Ewing's long-suffering wife Sue Ellen in the American hit soap Dallas from 1978 to 1991 which was shown in Britain by the BBC. The former model reprised the role in a new series of the much-loved American drama in 2011 but the show was axed once more earlier this year.

"Cesc Fabregas was sensationally left out of Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher's Monday Night Football team of the season so far - with Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin getting the nod instead. Carragher was keen to have Chelsea midfielder Fabregas in his side, with the Spaniard having made 13 assists so far this season, but Neville opted for Schneiderlin. The vote was then decided on Twitter by Sky Sports viewers, who voted overwhelmingly for the Saints midfielder ahead of Fabregas. Schneiderlin received 62 per cent of the vote.

Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher selected their combined team of the season so far on Monday night . Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin (left) was sensationally selected ahead of Fabregas in midfield . After the decision, Carragher joked: 'I hope Fabregas is not watching this show because he will never watch it again.' Neville then responded: 'He's in the running to be in the end of year team, and that's the most important one to be in!' However, Arsenal fans on Twitter claimed that they were responsible for Schneiderlin's inclusion at Fabregas' expense. There was something of a concerted campaign from Gunners on the social media site to vote for the Southampton man, keeping their former captain out of the team. Interestingly, the Sky Sports pundits agreed on nine starting players, with only the identity of one of their two centre backs being up for contention alongside Schneiderlin on Monday night. John Terry was chosen at centre back but his Chelsea team-mate Gary Cahill did not make the side . Eden Hazard (left) and Diego Costa were two of the six Chelsea players selected in the team . Again it was a Chelsea player up against a Southampton defender, with Carragher's selection of Jose Fonte winning the vote on Twitter ahead of Neville's suggestion of Gary Cahill. In all, six Chelsea stars did make the season's XI though - with John Terry, Cesar Azpilicueta, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Eden Hazard and Diego Costa all getting the nod. Manchester United's David de Gea was selected as the goalkeeper, with Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero completing the side.

De Gea has a save percentage of 75 per cent and has made 57 stops so far this season. Carragher on the other hand opted for Aguero, claiming the Premier League's top-scoring striker is the 'best player in the league'. He believes Aguero to be the 'one truly world-class' player plying his trade in England right now, and the only who would make a world XI. For young player of the season so far, Neville opted for Chelsea stopper Thibaut Courtois while Carragher chose De Gea. Sergio Aguero was chosen by Carragher as his player of the Premier League season so far . Neville opted for Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois as the young player of the season so far . Both pundits agreed on the best newcomer to the Premier League though, giving the award to Queens Park Rangers forward Charlie Austin for the impact he has made and the 'fantastic' goals he has scored for a team struggling in the top division. Most improved players of the season so far were chosen as Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane (Neville) and Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurdsson (Carragher), while managers of the campaign to date were West Ham United's Sam Allardyce (Neville) and Southampton's Ronald Koeman (Carragher).

"BBC presenter John Inverdale provoked fury yesterday after making a disparaging remark about the physical appearance of Women’s singles champion Marion Bartoli. Speaking on Radio 5 Live, he posed the question: ‘Do you think Bartoli’s dad told her when she was little, “You’re never going to be a looker?”’ His comments an hour before Ms Bartoli's match against Germany's Sabine Lisicki sparked widespread criticism with the BBC forced to apologise. But Bartoli today made light of his remarks - inviting Inverdale to ‘come and see me in my ball gown and heels’. Crass remark: John Inverdale has forced the BBC into making an appology after he suggested that Marion Bartoli the women's Wimbledon champion was 'never going to be a looker' Winner: Bartoli was attacked by Trolls on Twitter who criticised her looks and branded her as 'manly' In an interview with journalists from . her own country, Ms Bartoli said she wanted the BBC man to come and see . her at the traditional end-of-Wimbledon ball in London. She said: ‘Good, I invite this . journalist to come and see me this evening in ball gown and heels, and . in my opinion he could change his mind.’ Ms Bartoli also said: ‘It doesn't . matter, honestly. I am not blonde, yes. That is a fact. Have I dreamt . about having a model contract? No. I'm sorry. But have I dreamed about . winning Wimbledon? Absolutely, yes.’’ Speaking on the show yesterday, Inverdale had said: ‘I just wonder if her dad, because he has obviously been the most influential person in her life, did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, ""listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker"". ‘""You are never going to be somebody like a Sharapova, you're never going to be 5ft 11, you're never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that"". ‘""You are going to have to be the most dogged, determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it"", and she kind of is.’ Moment of glory: Marion Bartoli looked stunned after winning the ladies single title at Wimbledon yesterday . Bartoli’s father immediately rushed to her defence and the BBC was forced to apologise. The . French player’s father, Walter, who coached her until this year, said: . ‘The relationship between Marion and me has always been unbelievable so I . don’t  know what this reporter is talking about. ‘When she was five years old she was playing like every kid and having fun on the tennis court. She’s my beautiful daughter.’ He was among friends and family who supported Marion from the players’ box – and she made a beeline for him after claiming her first grand slam title with a 6-1 6-4 victory over German Sabine Lisicki. Twitter users were also highly critical, describing the remark as ‘shameful’ and ‘absolutely disgusting’. One wrote: ‘John Inverdale is never going to be a looker, or a thinker, or as good at anything as Bartoli.’ Another . said: ‘I can’t believe John Inverdale is so unpleasant and sexist about . Marion Bartoli. Expect he will say, “It was just a joke”. No, it . wasn’t, John.’ Marion Bartoli poses for a picture during a press conference today in southwest London after winning the women's singles Wimbledon Championships title yesterday . Comeback: Marion Bartoli today suggested the BBC journalist come and see her at the traditional end-of-Wimbledon ball in London . A BBC spokesman said: ‘We accept that this remark was insensitive and for that we apologise.’ Inverdale also gave a grovelling apology today. Speaking at the start of 5 live's coverage of the men's final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, Inverdale said: ‘Before we start, I probably ought to just briefly return to yesterday and a clumsy phrase that I used about Marion Bartoli which has understandably caused something of a furore. ‘The point I was trying to make, in a rather ham-fisted kind of way, was that in a world where the public perception of tennis players is that they're all 6ft tall Amazonian athletes, Mario - who is the Wimbledon champion - bucks that trend.’ He said she was ‘a fantastic example to all young people that it's attitude and will and determination together, obviously, with talent that, in the end, does get you to the top. ‘So I have apologised to Marion by letter if any offence was caused and I do hope that we can leave the matter there now’. The apology came as Bartoli faced a barrage of abuse from vile online trolls who took to Twitter to criticise her looks, saying that she did not deserve to win as she is too 'ugly'. Another said: 'For the first time ever a man wins the women's Wimbledon final! Go team men. #balls' And she was also told to: 'get a boob job with the money you won. ugly b****'. But the Twitter attacks have prompted an outpouring of criticism online as with Bartoli supporters rushing to her defence. One said: 'Bartoli as the complete underdog has just won Wimbledon. WHY ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER FACE AND BODY!!?!' Another added: 'Sadly being an amazing athlete counts for nothing if you're a woman :(' Bartoli . had endured a difficult 2013 before Wimbledon after failing to pass . the third round of any tournament. She had also never won a major tournament before. 'Honestly I just can't believe it,' she said. 'As a little girl I dreamt about this moment for so long. 'I . was there in 2007 and I missed out. I know how it feels Sabine, and I'm . sure, believe me, you'll be there one more time, I have no doubt about . it. 'When I started this . campaign on Court 14, I think if you told me I'd be here in the final I . wouldn't believe you. To hold the trophy is unthinkable. 'I'm just so happy to be holding this trophy.

"Comedian Adam Hills has raised over $90,000 for Robin William's favourite children's hospital after his public spat with a controversial American church group. Instead of giving money to Westboro Baptist Church to fly them 'first class' to Iraq to picket extreme Islamists - like he had joked - he donated the cash to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. And he has urged his fans to do the same. 'Not only will it help a child, it will really piss of a bigot,' he said. The Australian funny man declared his feud with Westboro Baptist Church over in a segment of his The Last Leg comedy show on Channel 4 in the UK this weekend. Hills has been in an ongoing Twitter battle with the church after they claimed 'Robin Williams was in hell' for staring as a gay character in various films and supporting US troops. Scroll down for video . 'God hates signs': Adam Hills has poked fun at Westboro Baptist Church again but said their war of words is over . Comedian Adam Hills said he is still receiving abuse from people despite donating money to a good cause . The threat, made by a church leader in a video message, angered Hills who fired a shot at the church on his television show and offered to fly members 'first class' to Iraq to picket extreme Islamists instead. 'We did seriously look into this and took onboard the advice of both the US and UK governments, neither of which were too happy about us sending professional s**t stirrers into a war zone,' Hills said his show on Saturday night. Westboro Baptist Church seemed enthusiastic about the idea of going to the Middle East. They tweeted Hills saying: 'Cough up the tickets funny man, we got our bags packed. Iraq needs some preaching.' 'These guys are so desperate for attention they make Lady Gaga look like Salman Rushdie.' Hills joked. The Australian comedian said he wants to spread 'love not hate' The Westboro Baptist Church said Hills should provide their plane tickets to Iraq or be quiet . Instead of giving the church the publicity they wanted Hills said he is going to 'fight hate with love'. His Crowd Rise fundraising page, set up by charity Planting Peace, says: 'Our neighbors at the Westboro Baptist Church have announced their intention to protest the funeral of Robin Williams. 'In keeping with our philosophy of addressing acts of hate and intolerance with compassion and love, we are inviting the public to show their respect and support of a man who spent his life making others smile, who was always there for others in their time of need, and who supported the greater good through works of service and charity. 'Please join Planting Peace in counteracting the WBC’s message of hate through a fundraising event benefiting St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a cause Mr. Williams passionately and publicly supported.' In response to Hills rant, the Westboro Church claimed it had picketed in Iraq before . In his rant last week Hills offered to 'personally pay for every member of the Westboro Baptist Church to fly to Iraq right now.' 'If you really believe in standing up to those threatening the Christian way of life, Westboro Baptist Church, how about putting your money where your mouth is, taking a direct flight to Iraq and picketing the people threatening to behead Christians if they don’t convert?' Robin Williams was the subject of an anti-gay video posted by the Westboro Church . Hills said there was one or two things he believed would happen to church members in Iraq, if they chose to fly. 'Either you’ll die while defending your beliefs and you’ll be carried away to heaven by a gold chariot to sit at the right hand of God for all eternity.' 'OR if I’m right, and I’m willing to bet a dozen first class flights that I am, God will be standing at the pearly gates alongside a 5ft 8 hairy American comedian dressed as a middle aged Scottish nanny saying, ‘Heeeellllooooo’. The offer was willingly accepted by the church who then tweeted 'show us the plane tickets!'.  It has now left the door wide open for a highly anticipated response from Hills which he is set to deliver on the next episode of his show. Hills said he will 'reply' to the Westboro Church, which has already claimed to have picketed in Iraq in the past. The Group told Adam Hills to show them plane tickets or 'hush' on the topic of picketing Robin Williams funeral . The Tweet Adam Hills posted in which he tells followers he plans to reply to followers of the Westboro Church offer of acceptance . Robin Williams as Armand Goldman in The Birdcage - a film about a gay cabaret owner and his drag queen companion . The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is an American unaffiliated Baptist church known for its extreme ideologies, especially those against gay people. The Kansas-based group said Williams spent his life 'mocking God and promoting sin' and 'pushing flagrant debauchery, and hedonism.' The 63-year-old played an openly gay character in the film The Birdcage, one of many gay characters he portrayed. The Westboro Baptist Church member’s failed to show up to Williams’ memorial service, which was held in San Francisco on Tuesday, but they did respond to Hills on Twitter, saying, 'Iraq here we come.'","Adam Hills has raised over $90,000 for Robin Williams' favourite children's hospital in America .

Now that's a stretch: Madonna's personal trainer, Nicole Winhoffer, has been unveiled as the new face, ambassador and trainer for Adidas by Stella McCartney . The new role will see Ms Winhoffer model the designer activewear and create unique training sessions for the brand. In a press release announcing the news, the trainer said: 'I am honored to be a part of [the Adidas] family. Fitness is art, and together, our marriage of movement, performance, and fashion will create a new standard. The sky is the limit!' Stella McCartney, too, voiced her enthusiasm for the partnership, stating: ‘It’s really exciting to have an opportunity to work with a woman that lives and breathes every moment of what she does and uses health and fitness in a way that inspires others. I am thrilled that she is joining the Adidas by Stella McCartney family.’ Ms Winhoffer met Madonna when she worked as a trainer on the Sticky & Sweet tour in 2009, and later stepped into the spotlight when the pair collaborated on a series of workout DVDs, Addicted to Sweat, and a global gym chain, Hard Candy Fitness.

She also trains the line’s designer, Stella McCartney, who at 43 and a mother-of-four, looks as good in her wares as any catwalk model. Ms Winhoffer’s celebrity roster also includes Rachel Weisz, Abbie Cornish, Andrea Riseborough and Steven Klein. The trainer has been credited with Madonna’s lithe figure, a far cry from the muscular physique she displayed while working with Ms Anderson. Productive partnership: Madonna and Ms Winhoffer, pictured in January, have collaborated on a series of workout DVDs, Addicted to Sweat, and a global gym chain, Hard Candy Fitness . The secret, she told E! News back in February, is down to 90 minute workouts, six days a week. ‘I create a new program each week,’ she said. ‘Mondays we learn the new program together. We focus on new muscle groups, new music and planting the programs in our body. Our workouts are challenging, serious and always focusing on shocking the body.'","Nicole Winhoffer, 30, replaced Tracy Anderson as Madonna’s personal trainer in 2009 .

"Former NBA star Charles Barkley has come to the defense of Adrian Peterson just days after the disgraced football player was indicted on charges of child abuse, claiming every black parent in the South whips their child. Appearing on NFL Today this Sunday, Barkley said, 'Whipping – we do that all the time. Every black parent in the South is going to be in jail under those circumstances.' He then stated that he believes there is a fine line between spanking and child abuse. Scroll down for video . Supporter: Charles Barkley is excusing the behavior of Adrian Peterson by claiming 'every black parent in the South whips their child' Indicted: Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings this Sunday, has been charged with reckless or negligent injury to a child . Victim: Peterson hit his son with a leafless branch, or switch, in May of this year, leaving the four-year-old with open wounds and bruises (above) A Houston grand jury indicted Peterson on Friday for reckless or negligent injury to a child, concluding that his use of a leafless tree branch, or switch, to repeatedly hit his son back in May was 'unreasonable discipline.' The four-year-old was left with numerous bruises and open wounds following the incident, which were documented with photographs. Barkley is claiming however that he believes this to be perfectly acceptable, and he went through much the same when he was a child. 'I’ve had many welts on my legs. I’ve gotten beat with switches – and I don’t even like the term,' Barkley stated. 'When the media talks about it, ‘beating a child,’ … we called it ""spanking"" or ""whipping"" our kids.' He then added, 'I think we have to really be careful trying to teach other parents how to discipline their kids. That’s a very fine line.' Peterson, who flew to Houston to turn himself in late Friday night,  was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday in the wake of this indictment, as the team lost to the New England Patriots 30 - 7. That decision is being applauded by former Viking, and current ESPN analyst, Cris Carter, who this weekend emotionally recounted his own experiences with abuse as a young child at the hands of his mother. Singing a different tune: ESPN analyst Cris Carter applauded the Vikings for sidelining Peterson . 'The only thing I’m proud about is the team that I played for, they did the right thing.' he said while appearing on NFL Countdown this Sunday. Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if found guilty. He will return to play next weekend it was announced earlier today, when the Vikings take on the New Orleans Saints.","Charles Barkley has come to the defense of Adrian Peterson after the football star was indicted on charges of child abuse .

"A young woman who says she's addicted to sunbeds admits even getting skin cancer hasn't put her off tanning. Lucy Simm, 29, from Morecambe, was keen to get back on a sunbed as soon as she had recovered from an operation to remove a cancerous mole on her leg. She told Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on today's This Morning: 'It's been very hard to stop, I want to hide away. I feel like a tan gives me a blanket and without it, I have to hide away. I tried fake tan and it's just not the same.' Scroll down for video . Addicted: Lucy, left, can't stop using sunbeds despite getting skin cancer. Her sister Sam has also had to have moles removed over fears they were cancerous . Mother-of-one Lucy appeared on the ITV show with her twin sister, Sam, who has also had a skin cancer health scare. The pair, who are care workers, both started tanning at the age of 14 and it quickly became a daily ritual. They liked the way the tan made them look and feel more confident. 'It was new to our town, it was a thing to do,' Sam explained. Mother-of-two Sam stopped going on sunbeds four years ago but some damage was already done. Dying for a tan: The twins started using sunbeds at the age of 14 and have both had health scares . She said: 'I noticed a mole on my side which I thought was chocolate because of how quickly it came but it didn't wipe off. I went to the doctors to have it looked at and they referred me and took it off straight away. 'There was a difficult four to five week wait to see if it was cancer but it was ok.' Despite Sam's scare, Lucy was not put off going on a sunbed. 'I put what happened to Sam to the back of my mind. I thought it wouldn't happen to me,' she admits. But then she also noticed an unusual-looking mole on her leg that was turning a dark blue colour. 'I showed it to Sam and she knew straight away there was something wrong with it,' she said. The mole was removed but further tests revealed Lucy was not as lucky as her sister had been. 'I was told it was cancer - melanoma - and I would need further treatment. I felt stupid, like I had done it to myself,' she said. Be safe: Fake tan is an alternative to using sun beds for those who want a tan without the dangers . A good way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is to use the ABCDE checklist: . A stands for asymmetrical: Melanomas have two very different halves and are an irregular shape. B stands for border: Unlike a normal mole, melanomas have a notched or ragged border. C stands for colours: Melanomas will be a mix of two or more colours. D stands for diameter: Unlike most moles, melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter. E stands for enlargement or evolution: A mole that changes characteristics and size over time is more likely to be a melanoma. Information taken from www.nhs.uk . 'I couldn't take it all in, I had to leave the room. It's still unbelievable. I had an operation on my leg and I've been left with a big scar.' But despite the shock diagnosis and treatment, Lucy still can't give up using sunbeds. She's been back on them following her operation and said she needs help to conquer what she calls an addiction. 'My face wasn't going right without the sunbed,' she said. 'I felt like the skin on my face was drying out and my make up doesn't sit right without a tan.' Presenters Holly and Phillip encouraged Lucy to try fake tan as an alternative to sun beds and invited her back on the show next week to test them. The show's resident medical expert, Dr Chris, who has suffered from skin cancer, advised Lucy to follow her sister's example and give up sunbeds for good. He told her to think of her son and how she was putting him in danger of growing up without his mother. 'I will be happy in my skin one day, it's just getting there,' Lucy said.","Lucy Simm, 29, from Morecambe, has had skin cancer .

"A leading member of a Hungarian anti-Semitic party, notorious for his provocative comments about Jews has discovered that he is a Jew himself. Ultra nationalist Csanad Szegedi of the far-right Jobbik Party had accused Jews of ‘buying up’ the country, railed about the ‘Jewishness’ of the political elite and claimed Jews were desecrating national symbols. That was until it was revealed that his grandmother was a survivor of Auschwitz death camp and his grandfather was a forced labour camp veteran. Anti-Semite finds out he's Jewish: Ultra nationalist Csanad Szegedi, was a leading member of a far-right political party until he was forced to resign after it was revealed that he is actually Jewish . After weeks of internet rumours, Szegedi acknowledged in June that his grandparents on his mother's side were Jews, making him one too under Jewish law even though he does not practice the faith. Since then, the 30-year-old has been politically exiled from Jobbik with his political career on the brink of collapse. Under pressure, Szegedi resigned last . month from all party positions and gave up his Jobbik membership and . last week the party asked him to give up his seat in the European . Parliament as well. Jobbik says its issue is the suspected bribery, not . his Jewish roots. At the root of the drama is an audio tape of a 2010 meeting between Szegedi and a convicted felon which he acknowledges took place but contends that the tape was altered in unspecified ways. The Jobbik Party considers it real. In the recording, felon Zoltan Ambrus is heard confronting Szegedi with evidence of his Jewish roots, telling him he has documents to prove Szegedi’s heritage. Szegedi sounds surprised, then offers money and favours in exchange for keeping quiet. Szegedi came to prominence in 2007 as a . founding member of the Hungarian Guard, a group whose black uniforms and . striped flags recalled the Arrow Cross, a pro-Nazi party which briefly . governed Hungary at the end of World War Two and killed thousands of . Jews. Grandparents were Holocaust survivors: Szegedi's grandmother survived Auschwitz death camp, pictured, and his grandfather worked at forced labour camps . The group was banned by the courts in 2009 but by then, Szegedi had already joined the Jobbik Party, which was launched in 2003 to become the country's biggest far-right political force. He soon became one of its most vocal and visible members, and a pillar of the party leadership. Since 2009, he has served in the European Parliament in Brussels as one of the party's three EU lawmakers, a position he says he wants to keep. The fallout of Szegedi's ancestry saga has also extended to his business interests with Jobbik executive director Gabor Szabo pulling out of an internet site selling nationalist Hungarian merchandise that he owns with Szegedi. Szabo said his sister has resigned as Szegedi's personal assistant. Ambrus, who served time in prison on a weapons and explosives conviction, apparently rejected Szegedi’s bribes. He said he secretly taped the conversation as part of an internal Jobbik power struggle aimed at ousting Szegedi from a local party leadership post. The party's reaction was swift. Jobbik president Gabor Vona said: ‘We have no alternative but to ask him to return his EU mandate. ‘Jobbik does not investigate the heritage of its members or leadership, but instead takes into consideration what they have done for the nation.’ Szegedi, who was raised Presbyterian, acknowledged his Jewish origins in various media interviews with Hungarian media in June. The Holocaust was a taboo subject during Hungary's decades of communist rule that ended in 1990 and many survivors chose to keep their ordeals to themselves. Unspoken horrors: Until 1990, the Holocaust was a taboo subject with 550,000 Hungarians Jews killed, most sent on trains to death camps . In all, 550,000 Hungarian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, most sent in trains to death camps such as Auschwitz. After discovering he was Jewish, Szegedi met with Rabbi Slomo Koves, of Hungary's Orthodox Chabad-Lubavitch community in early August, whose own parents were in their teens when they discovered they were Jewish. Koves said: ‘As a rabbi ... it is my duty to receive every person who is in a situation of crisis and especially a Jew who has just now faced his heritage.’ During the meeting, Szegedi apologised for any statements which may have offended the Jewish community and vowed to visit Auschwitz to pay his respects. Koves described the conversation as ‘difficult and spiritually stressful’, but said he is hopeful for a successful outcome. He said: ‘Csanad Szegedi is in the middle of a difficult process of reparation, self-knowledge, re-evaluation and learning, which according to our hopes and interests, should conclude in a positive manner. ‘Whether this will occur or not is first and foremost up to him.’ Szegedi said that after the meeting with Ambrus he had a long conversation with his grandmother who spoke about her family's past as Orthodox Jews. He told Hir TV: ‘It was then that it dawned on me that my grandmother really is Jewish. ‘I asked her how the deportations happened. She was in Auschwitz and Dachau and she was the only survivor in the extended family.’ He denied ever making anti-Semitic statements but several of his speeches and media appearances suggest otherwise. Judaism is traced from mother to child, meaning that under Jewish law Szegedi is Jewish but he said he defines himself as someone with ‘ancestry of Jewish origin - because I declare myself 100 percent Hungarian’. In a November 2010 interview on Hungarian state television, Szegedi blamed the large-scale privatisation of state assets after the end of communism on ‘people in the Hungarian political elite who shielded themselves in their Jewishness’. Speaking on a morning program in late 2010, he said that ‘the problem the radical right has with the Jews’ was that Jewish artists, actors and intellectuals had desecrated Hungary's national symbols like the Holy Crown of St. Stephen, the country's first Christian king. Szegedi also complained of ‘massive real estate purchases being done in Hungary, where - it's no secret - they want to bring in Israeli residents’. Szegedi declined to be interviewed for the story.","Ultra nationalist Csanad Szegedi's political career is in ruins after he was forced to resign from far-right Jobbik Party .

"The mother of a little girl who was beaten black and blue by an 'out-of-control' two-year-old at nursery has called for the child's expulsion. Katie Ann Guttridge, aged three, sustained a bruised eye socket, scratches and three bite marks when she was attacked by her classmate during playtime at Ratby Pre-School Nursery in Leicester. The little girl's mother, Clara Mackow, said her daughter was almost blinded in the attack and that her injuries were so bad that she was taken to hospital with a suspected broken eye socket. Injuries at the hands of a two-year-old: Katie's mother said her daughter looked like she had been mauled by a dog . 'Almost blinded': Katie Ann Guttridge had to be taken to hospital after the attack because doctors thought she had broken her eye socket . Police were called in to investigate the assault but were powerless to act because the girl who attacked Katie is below the legal age of criminal responsibility - which in this country is 10 years old. When confronted by journalists, the mother of the violent girl refused to discuss her child's behaviour, saying only: 'My daughter is two years old. I want nothing more to do with this.' Now, parents are demanding the child - who has been dubbed 'Chucky' after the violent child-like doll in the horror film Child's Play - be removed from the nursery after she attacked 10 other children. Ms Mackow, 28, a trainee goldsmith, said she couldn't believe it when she saw her daughter after the attack on December 13, adding: 'I just cried. 'She had gashes to her lips and a terrible black eye. Katie looked like she had been in a fight with a dog that had mauled her. 'We had to take her to hospital because the doctors thought she had fractured her eye socket. Recovering... but Katie's mother Clara wants the nursery to remove the violent child . 'She was almost blinded in the attack which was totally unprovoked. I know kids get into scrapes but my daughter was really hurt in this attack.' It has been claimed the two-year-old, who has not been identified, has attacked 10 other children since she started the nursery in September. Ms Mackow, who also has a five-year-old son Joshua, said: 'The little girl is two but she has behavioural problems. 'The little girl who attacked her has a history of beating up other children. She's out of control. 'I know 10 other children have been assaulted by the girl since September. The staff at the nursery don't seem able to cope with the difficult children. 'Ironically, the little girl's mother is a child minder with close links to the nursery and school so the staff consider her one of their own and seem reluctant to discipline her. 'Nursery and pre-school should be fun and enjoyable but Katie is scared of going now and doesn't even want to go outside in case she bumps into the girl who hurt her.' Katie and the girl started at the pre-school and nursery, held in Ratby Village Hall, at the same time in September. Official nursery incident reports showed Katie has been attacked on four separate occasions by the same girl. The nursery's Accident/Injury form states that on September 22 the girl hit Katie on the forehead with a 'plastic yellow drummer'. On October 11 the same girl 'pushed two duplo bricks together pinching Katie's left hand.' On November 5 the same child 'grabbed Katie's hair and face and sucked her cheek causing a mark.' The incident was deemed so serious nursery managers sent a letter home to Katie's parents explaining her injuries. But the most serious attack happened on December 13 when the girl cornered Katie in the book area of the nursery. Nursery staff applied an ice pack to Katie's face to reduce the swelling and called in her father Lewis Guttridge to collect her and take her to hospital. Mr Guttridge, 32, a property developer and commercial landlord, said: 'Katie is normally such a bubbly little girl but this seems to have frightened her and left her very nervous and scared to be around other children. 'I was horrified that my daughter has been exposed to such violence in a place which should be safe. 'I understand the police can't do anything because of the girl's age but the nursery should expel her.' Ms Mackow also alleged that the eight childminders at the nursery were ‘more interested in drinking tea’ than caring for the youngsters. She said: ‘When Lewis went to pick Katie up he saw that six of the eight staff who were on duty were all drinking tea in a side room and chatting about the weather. ‘No one seemed to be looking after the children who were in the main hall. Under fire: Parents have criticised the Ratby Pre-school Nursery (pictured) for not removing the child . ‘I have to say the staff are more laid . back than I would want but you just put your faith in them and trust . that they will look after your child. ‘If Katie has been attacked by the same girl in a period of just three months how many other children have been assaulted? ‘When I spoke to the staff about how Katie got her latest injuries they told me no one had seen the attack. ‘I wanted to know why but they said it happened in the book area of the hall and no one saw it happen. ‘Katie told me the girl had attacked her and other children backed her up.’ The nursery did not respond to these allegations when they were put to them . Katie went to the nursery three days a week between 9am-3.30pm at a cost of £3.75-an-hour. The nursery has a maximum of 26 . children aged between two and four years old but has more than 100 . youngsters on their books and waiting list. Ms Mackow is now preparing to take legal action against the nursery claiming negligence. She added: ‘I am not doing this for . the money, I just want parents to be aware that when they drop their . children at nursery or pre-school they should not blindly believe they . will be safe.’ Record: Official nursery incident reports showed Katie has been attacked on four separate occasions . Other parents of the 25 children at the nursery are also calling for the girl to be booted out. One mother, whose son was also beaten up by the girl, said: 'The little girl is a nightmare. 'If there's a child who has been hurt the other mums and dads always say ""has Chucky been at it again?"". 'It's no laughing matter for the kids though, they are terrified of this little girl who has a really vicious streak. 'My . son is four and he came back from the pre-school shaking and sobbing . because the little girl had threatened to beat him up with a toy brick . if he didn't give her a book he was reading. 'She's terrorising the other kids and the staff don't lift a finger to stop her.' An injury form filled out by the nursery on the day of the attack stated: 'Another child told me Katie was crying. 'I picked her up and noticed three bite marks to her face, her left eye, left jaw and left lip.' Jill Bottrill, manager of Ratby Pre-school Nursery, said: 'We are working closely with the local authority and parents and the pre-school.' Leicestershire Police on Wednesday confirmed they had investigated the attack. A spokeswoman said: 'We did get a report from the parents who came into the police station and said their daughter had been injured at a nursery by another child. 'The girl is below the age of criminal responsibility so there is nothing else the police can do. 'We suggested the parents contact the nursery and other agencies.'","Girl was taken to hospital with suspected fracture to her eye socket following attack .

Top with a scant 2 tablespoons of the ricotta mixture. Repeat with the cookie crumbs, coffee mixture, and ricotta mixture. Cover each with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, which takes at least one hour and up to one day. Just before serving, top each tiramisù with an equal amount of berries. Using the large holes on a box grater, grate the chocolate onto a sheet of waxed paper. Lift up the waxed paper and use it to help sprinkle the chocolate over the berries. Serve chilled. 'They are going to stay in touch with Teresa while she is in prison by taping phone calls and if possible, they will do jailhouse interviews with her.' Once she leaves the prison the first person to get an interview will be Andy Cohen on BRAVO, says the insider.

"A 59-year-old man was lucky to survive a bear attack in George Washington National Forest on Thursday, after his trusted pet Labrador came to the rescue and helped fend off the angry animal. Steven Krichbaum, 59, of Staunton, Virginia, was walking in the woods in Hardy County, West Virginia with his pet, a yellow Labrador mix named Henry, when they came upon a black bear and two cubs. Fearing for her cubs safety, the bear’s primary instinct was to attack Krichbaum and his dog. Henry’s bravery helped save his master’s life. While he fought with the bear, it allowed Krichbaum time to repeatedly strike the animal with a rock. Steven Krichbaum, 59, of Staunton, Virginia, is treated for his injuries after being attacked by a bear. His brave pet Henry sits in between his legs . Both dog and owner were seriously injured in the struggle, but despite bleeding profusely Krichbaum was able to drive his Suburu station wagon out the park, reports WHSV. Dazed and not familiar with the area, Krichbaum struggled to locate a hospital and so stopped at Richards Fruit Market in search of assistance. Owner Eddie Richard told NV Daily that the station wagon pulled into his parking lot at about 1 p.m. with both the driver and dog covered in blood. 'He was really bleeding out,' said Richard. 'He had a huge open gash on his forearm.' Richard’s wife Nancy called an ambulance while she and a friend, Cathy Patterson, used towels and a bandanna to try and stop the bleeding. Hero: Henry was taken by the Frederick County Sheriff's Animal Control unit to a local emergency animal hospital after suffering an injury to his hind leg in the bear attack . Krichbaum's wounds included a hole the size of a 50-cent coin in one of his upper thighs and scratch marks. 'He had claw marks and gashes,' Patterson said. Henry had also suffered from wounds, mostly to one of his hind legs. After being treated by an ambulance crew for about 25 minutes, Krichbaum was transported to Winchester Medical Center. Henry was taken by the Frederick County Sheriff's Animal Control unit to a local emergency animal hospital. Both are expected to be okay.","Steven Krichbaum, 59, was attacked in George Washington National Forest while out walking with his pet, a yellow Labrador mix named Henry .

"Fluctuating: Mother-of-four posh Spice is well known for her boob job and subsequent removal . When it comes to breast implants, more and more British women say that bigger is better - and are instructing surgeons to increase their bust by four of more cup sizes in a single operation. The number of females opting for such ‘super boob jobs’ has doubled in the past three years. According to the latest figures collated by a leading implant manufacturer, ten per cent of Britons  are now asking for the four-cup boost. In 2010, the figure was just five per cent. But surgeons sometimes face a hard task . trying to meet the demands of women – not only do they want bigger . breasts, they also want them to look natural rather than opting for the . ‘bolt-on’ implants favoured by model Jordan. Miles Berry, a cosmetic surgeon and . author of The Good Boob Bible, said: ‘Women come in clutching pictures . of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and say they want a similar . look. They are emphatic that they don’t want to look like Jordan or . Pamela Anderson. Victoria epitomises the more subtle have-I haven’t-I . look.’ He added: ‘Women want . bigger, more pert breasts, but they don’t necessarily want people to . know they’ve had something done. The majority of my patients are . slightly older women who have had babies.’ The British figures are in contrast to those from Asia. In Hong Kong and Japan 80 per cent of women paid for a one cup-size increase. Venezuelan women have the biggest desire for the pneumatic look – 20 per cent of them go for an increase of four cup sizes. Breast augmentation is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery in the UK, with 9,854 procedures carried out in last year alone. Demand has continued unabated despite the recent PIP scandal, in which the sale of faulty implants caused a global health scare. The data was collated by implant manufacturer Global Consolidated Aesthetics from 800,000 operations carried out worldwide.’","10 per cent of Britons are now asking for breast boosts of at least four cup sizes .
But surgeons are increasingly struggling to make such size increases look natural ."
"President Barack Obama faced a tough crowd on Tuesday – American military veterans – and fell flat on his applause lines as he failed to win over the American Legion's convention-goers. His 35-minute speech seemed to have reminded the audience of the stark divide between the White House's policy choices and the feelings of the men and women often called on to carry them out. A Virginia legionnaire who served in the U.S. Marine Corps told MailOnline that 'a small group of Obama's admirers – and there are some here – sat near the front and tried to generate applause for him about 10 times.' 'They didn't get much pickup,' the retired lieutenant colonel said of the 'instigators' gathered at the Charlotte, North Carolina event, but 'they were persistent. You could tell when the applause was genuine and when it wasn't. It was obvious to everyone here.' Most of the veterans sat on their hands, leaving awkward silences where White House speechwriters expected ovations. Scroll down for video . Not buying it: An estimated 10,000 American Legionnaires registered to attend the convention in Charlotte, but few of them were on their feet clapping for the commander-in-chief . Silence: President Barack Obama couldn't pull the trigger on applause lines that usually succeed with his more reliably partisan audiences . Salute! The president offered respect to a female airman after his speech, but he got little respect from thousands of men and women who had already served in the armed forces . 'Some of these guys – well, most of them – remember that Obama sent Biden to speak to us last year in Houston, and blew us off entirely during his 2012 campaign.' That year, the president sent a 3-minute video message instead of coming to Indianapolis. Mitt Romney, his Republican rival, flew 1,000 miles to speak in person. The veteran asked MailOnline to conceal his identity. 'I don't need that kind of trouble,' he said. 'I work for a government contractor.' After the customary introductions and thank-yous to dignitaries, Obama spoke for nearly eight full minutes on Tuesday without a single clap. He touted his foreign policy bona fides, boasting that 'even countries that criticize us – when the chips are down and they need help, they know who to call. They call us. That's what American leadership looks like.' Silence. 'Sustaining our leadership, keeping America strong and secure, means we have to use our power wisely,' Obama cautioned, in keeping with his slow approach to battling ISIS and other terror groups overseas. 'History teaches us of the dangers of overreaching and spreading ourselves too thin, and trying to go it alone without international support, or rushing into military adventures without thinking through the consequences.' Crickets. 'You know that we should never send America's sons and daughters into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary and we have a plan and we are resourcing it and prepared to see it through.' Tepid clapping followed pregnant seconds of emptiness. 'We removed more than 140,000 troops from Iraq and welcomed those troops home. It was the right thing to do.' Nothing. Obama couldn't muster sustained applause for a declaration that 'in just four months we will complete our combat mission in Afghanistan and America's longest war will come to a responsible end.' Not even when he paused to honor 'every American who served to make this progress possible, every single one, especially the more than 2,200 American patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan to keep us safe.' The White House is touting a package of 19 'executive actions' designed to improve the lot of servicemen and women after they return to civilian life. Many are symbolic or represent minor changes. A few indicate significant moves in the direction  veterans groups have demanded for decades: . After he pledged to 'partner with Afghans so their country can never again be used to launch attacks against the United States,' four seconds elapsed before a weak round of clapping could be heard in the hall. Obama did hit his stride, eventually. A louder but brief ovation rang out after he laid down an ultimatum to ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. 'Our message to anyone who harms our people is simple,' he said, calling to mind last week's beheading video of American photojournalist James Foley. 'American does not forget. Our reach is long. We are patient. Justice will be done. We have proved time and time again we will do what's necessary to capture those who harm Americans – to go after those who harm Americans.' But the legionnaires held back their heartfelt acclaim for a full 17 minutes until the president mentioned the cure for what ails them. Obama's first and only truly robust applause line came with a pledge to reform the Veterans Affairs Department, which has come under fire for months-long medical wait times and a scheme that buried appointments in order to artificially inflate success numbers. 'The misconduct we've seen of too many facilities, with long wait times and veterans denied care, and folks cooking the books, is outrageous and inexcusable,' Obama said, waking up the crowd's enthusiasm. 'We're focused on this at the highest levels. We are going to get to the bottom of these problems, we are going to fix what is wrong.' 'We are going to do right by you and we are going to do right by your families,' he said, earning his only spontaneous hoots and shouts. 'And that is a solemn pledge of commitment that I'm making to you here.' The VA, he said, has been given 'the authority to more quickly remove senior executives who don't meet our high standards. If you engage in unethical practices or cover up a serious problem, you should be and will be fired.' Rep. Jeff Miller, the Republicans' top dog on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told the Washington Examiner after Obama spoke that despite the president's rhetoric, the White House has stymied Congress in its attempts to clean up the VA. 'No one has been fired as a result of the VA scandal,' Miller said. 'The department is still sitting on 113 outstanding information requests from the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and VA whistle-blowers who tried to expose problems are still enduring retaliation.' Not impressed: American Legionnaires only rose to their feet to praise fellow veterans and hoot about firing VA miscreants, whiel they sat on their hands for Obama's applause lines about his military strategy . Is this thing on? Obama spoke for nearly 8 minutes without a single applause line, despite pausing several times in hope of an ovation . Nuclear: Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan (L) is in the fight of her life in North Carolina, and greeted Obama at the airport but DIDN'T appear on stage with him . Daggers: Republican US Senator Richard Burr is no fan of Obama and hopes his flagging numbers drag down Hagan to provide his state with a GOP replacement . Obama's speech described a set of 19 'executive actions' – mostly small policy shifts, but including a few major tacks – designed to quell criticism of how his administration has cared for veterans since January 2009. They include expanded suicide prevention programs, new research funding for science that could change treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and a mandate that the Pentagon and VA provide a seamless transition for servicemen and women who receive mental health treatment and medications. The Republican Party took shots at the president on Tuesday for allowing problems to fester on his watch. The GOP also aimed at North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, who is in a tough battle to keep her seat this November. 'It's been six years and President Obama and Senator Hagan have failed to deliver on the promises they've made to our veterans,' said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short. 'On their watch the systemic problems at the VA have only gotten worse, despite lofty campaign promises to fix the problem. But instead of delivering results for our veterans, Hagan has delivered for President Obama 96 percent of the time while failing to get a single bill she’s authored passed into law.' Hagan addressed the legionnaires separately from Obama. The two joked and hugged after the president deplaned from Air Force One, but did not appear on stage together.","President fell flat as audience of thousands responded to military pledges with anemic ovations .

"Thomas Beatie, the transgender man who rose to fame in 2007 when he became pregnant through artificial insemination, has been charged with stalking his ex-wife. The 40-year-old, who was born a woman and gave birth to three children following a partial sex change, allegedly tracked his former partner, Nancy Beatie,  using a GPS device. He was arrested last Thursday after a public safety officer spotted the device while helping Ms Beatie fix her flat tire on a freeway in Phoenix, Arizona, according to court records. Now, he has been charged with a felony count of stalking Ms Beatie, who has been identified as the 'victim' by the suspect's fiancée, Amber Nicholas, but is yet to be formally named by police. Scroll down for video . Charged: Thomas Beatie (pictured in his mugshot), the transgender man who rose to fame in 2007 when he became pregnant through artificial insemination, has been charged with stalking his ex-wife, Nancy Beatie . Beatie, who lives in Anthem, Arizona, was released from Maricopa County Jail on Friday morning, according to TMZ. He will shortly appear in court to answer to the charges. Shockingly, in a police interview, Beatie reportedly admitted to putting the GPS device on his ex-wife's car in 2012, explaining how he changed the batteries several times. He initially activated the device on the vehicle - which he owned at the time - around six months after he served Ms Beatie with an order of protection after claiming she attacker him, it is said. When Ms Beatie took ownership of the vehicle, Beatie claimed he did not take off the device, but had not monitored it for 'a while', the Arizona Republic reported. Pregnant: The 40-year-old (pictured, during one of his pregnancies), who was born a woman and gave birth to three children following a partial sex change, allegedly tracked his former spouse using a GPS device . Victim? Now, he has been charged with stalking Ms Beatie (pictured with Beatie in 2011), who has been identified as the 'victim' by the suspect's fiancée, Amber Nicholas, but is yet to be formally named by police . However, Ms Beatie allegedly told police her ex-husband often appeared at places she was at and would ask her where she had been. His knowledge of her movements made her afraid, she said. Even if he is convicted of stalking his former spouse, Beatie will not be sentenced to time at the city's Tent City prison - because he is a first time offender, court officials told TMZ. Instead, he will likely receive probation, it is reported. Beatie - who kept his reproductive organs when he had sex-reassignment surgery - married his ex-wife in Hawaii in 2003. The pair have three children, all of whom Beatie gave birth to. In 2012, the suspect filed for divorce from his partner. Arrest: Shockingly, in a police interview, Beatie (pictured in his police report) admitted to putting the GPS device on his ex-wife's car in 2012, explaining how he changed the batteries several times, it is claimed . Transgender: Beatie (pictured  in 2008) kept his reproductive organs when he had sex-reassignment surgery . A judge just granted the pair the right to get divorced in August 14 after it had previously been denied as it was not viewed as legal by some courts. Maricopa County Family Court Judge Douglas Gerlach had ruled that Arizona's ban on same-sex marriages prevented Mr Beatie's marriage from being recognized as valid. Gerlach said he had no jurisdiction to approve a divorce because there's insufficient evidence that Beatie was a man when he got married. The judge said the Beaties never provided records to fully explain what Mr Beatie actually had done and not done to become a man. Tracker: Ms Beatie allegedly told police her ex-husband often appeared at places she was at and would ask her where she had been. Above, a GPS tracking device, similar to the one placed on Ms Beatie's vehicle . New lady: Beatie, who will shortly appear in court to face the charges,  is now dating Amber Nicholas (above) The ruling also noted that Mr Beatie had halted the testosterone treatments. That all changed when Judge Kenton D. Jones said in a 12-page opinion, 'As the Beaties' Hawaii marriage was lawfully entered in Hawaii and is not deemed void by Arizona law, the marriage is valid within this state.' If their appeal had not gone through, the couple would have been forced to go to Hawaii to get a divorce.","Thomas Beatie, 40, has been charged with stalking ex-wife, Nancy Beatie .

"Twitter has held talks with Shots, the selfie app backed by singer Justin Bieber. Twitter's acquisition plans became the subject of hot speculation on Monday after CFO Anthony Noto accidentally tweeted a message about making plans for a deal. Now it is believed the firm in question could be Shots, which Bieber invested in last year. The app, which was originally called Shots of Me, is available in Apple's App Store and encourages people to take and share pictures of themselves with a smartphone's front-facing camera. The app, which was originally called Shots of Me, is available in Apple's App Store and encourages people to take and share pictures of themselves with a smartphone's front-facing camera. It has an Instagram-inspired social network, which also links to Twitter to create a kind of network just for self-portraits. The message expressed his desire to acquire another company. Mr Noto, who joined the company in July this year, deleted the tweet soon after. It read: 'I think we should buy them. He is on your schedule for Dec 15 or 16 -- we will need to sell him. i have a plan.' Twitter often acquires smaller firms who have created good features based around the micro-blogging service. Speculation over which firm Mr Noto was referring to has begun. Technology news site Recode suggested Shots - a selfie app backed by Justin Bieber - as well as Secret, a somewhat controversial app for anonymously sharing messages with a wide audience. 'Shots co-founders John and Sam Shahidi have had multiple meetings at Twitter headquarters over the past month, according to people familiar with the discussions,' it said. The app, which was originally called Shots of Me, is available in Apple's App Store and encourages people to take and share pictures of themselves with a smartphone's front-facing camera. It has an Instagram-inspired social network, which also links to Twitter to create a kind of network just for self-portraits. The app, created by RockLive is part funded by Justin Bieber, who was reportedly attracted to the product because it does not allow people to leave any comments. John Shahidi, CEO of RockLive, told TechCrunch at the app's unveiling that people enjoy looking at other people instead of browsing pictures of lunches and sunsets, which are common on other photo sharing platforms, such as Instagram. The Shots of Me app features a feed of selfies from friends and Twitter contacts as well as their names, locations, captions and the amount of 'likes' a photo receives. The anti-trolling aspect is said to have attracted Justin Bieber to Shots of Me, who told Mr Shahidi that he is annoyed by other platforms allowing homophobic slurs and hate messages to be posted. Users of the app can only take photos of themselves using the front-facing camera of a phone and even then, can only take them via the Shots of Me app. This means that no uploading of images is allowed in a bid to 'capture the moment'. Instead of leaving comments about selfies for all users to see, Shots of Me has a direct messaging system that invites messages from followers, in a bid to stop users criticising people in public - known as trolling. Users of the app can only take photos of themselves using the front-facing camera of a phone within the Shots of Me app. Instead of leaving comments, the app has a direct messaging system in a bid to stop to stop trolling . Survey claims Britons take 35million 'selfies' every month. More than 50 per cent admit snapping themselves with their mobile phones and cameras. A quarter of those even admit to taking a sexy selfie, but 36 per cent later regret it. Facebook is the most popular place to upload the photographs. Three-quarters of young people aged between 18 and 24 admit taking selfies, the study by mobile phone company HTC found. But the trend isn't limited to the young. Twenty nine per cent, of those aged over 65 also take selfies. The new craze, which involves posing by yourself before taking a picture, has risen in popularity, with over one million selfies taken every day. The anti-trolling aspect is said to have attracted Justin Bieber to Shots of Me, who told Mr Shahidi that hs is annoyed by other platforms allowing homophobic slurs and hate messages to be posted. Mr Shahidi told TechCrunch: 'The commenting thing was something he really cared about. Not just for himself, but for the kids. 'He said: 'I want a platform where my fans don't have to deal with this.' We didn't ask him for money. He said 'I want to be part of this.' The company had raised just over one-and-a-half million dollars, but Justin Bieber contributed the majority of the $1.1million second round of investment. However, while this might be the popstar's first publicly announced personal investment, he is believed to have backed a number of startups. While some people might think Shots of Me is a vehicle for vanity, there is no doubt that people are sharing more selfies than ever on social networks and it will be interesting to see if this dedicated app can capitalise on the trend. It faces stiff competition from established photo sharing platforms like Instagram, which has 150 active users as well as Snapchat, which allows users to post photos which are deleted within 10 seconds.","Shots is available in Apple's App .

"Criminal: Ken Boonstra, 48, has been identified as the man who broke into a young couple's home and was killed during a struggle . An intruder who was stabbed to death after breaking into a gym owner's house had been planning to sexually assault his wife and video tape it, according to reports this week. Ken Boonstra was stabbed to death by a 26-year-old woman while her husband struggled with him in their Washington home. Police have now revealed that Boonstra, 48, had a camera and tripod in his pocket when he broke into the couple's home. The couple, who own a local branch of a gym, are not being identified because they are the victims of a crime. The wife's mother and the couple's seven-month-old daughter were both in the home at the time of the attack. The Seattle Times reports that the fatal early morning break in on May 13 was not the first time that Boonstra had been in the couple's home. He went into the house 12 hours before the attack and threatened the wife, grabbing her by her ponytail and demanding all of her money. She didn't get a good look at him because her hair was grabbed from behind, West said. She was slapped and punched in the face and suffered an ankle injury as she was dragged by her hair. 'This guy apparently grabbed her by the pony tail, swung her around, robbed her, and then either slapped or punched her in the face,' said Sgt Cindi West, spokesman with King Country sheriff's department. At the time, that was $41 cash, and her left the house. The wife called police to report the robbery and was understandably frazzled. The recording of the call hears the dispatcher tell her to take a deep breath and reassures her that police are on the way. She responds: 'I just want them to be here... I'm sorry, I'm just so scared.' Fighting back: The couple, whose names are not being revealed because they are the victim of a crime, fought back against the attacker who had attacked the wife 12 hours earlier also in their home . The problem therein appears to be that he became familiar with both the house and the woman prompting him to return later that night with the apparent intention of sexually assaulting or abducting her. The wife was not the only woman involved in the attack, as initial reports also stated that her mother was also involved, along with her husband. The family went out to dinner that night and then went to bed by 10pm after 'triple checking' the locks on every door. Hours later around 1.40am, the husband woke when their dogs started barking. When he heard the dogs begin to growl, he ran back to get wasp spray which he used on the intruder with little success. The wife originally came into the struggle armed with a baseball bat but that broke during the altercation. Defending their home: The couple were in their Washington home with their 7-month-old daughter and the wife's mother at the time of the attack in May . 'When the husband was fighting with the intruder, the wife was the one that went and got the knife, and stabbed the intruder, trying to help her husband out,' said West. It took several stabs of the knife to get Boonstra to stop fighting. 'The overall circumstances indicate that the suspect may have entered the home this morning with the intent of abduction and sexual assault,' the police report read. Police were able to confirm that Boonstra was the man responsible for the earlier break in because the wife had knocked off his hat during that struggle. DNA tests later matched the fibers on the hat to Boonstra's dead body. Boonstra's mother told The Seattle Times that her son had been 'going downhill' ever since his divorce years earlier and police found a collection of videos posted to Youtube wherein he made religious and anti-women ramblings. The intruder apparently was the same man who robbed the woman in the North Bend home Sunday - just 12 hours earlier . Before the inital break in, the wife had taken to Facebook to post her joy at celebrating her first Mother's Day with her baby girl, boasting of her incredible husband and saying she 'couldn't ask for anything more.' The trainer at a Cascade gym was then deluged with messages of support from friend, with one declaring her a 'mother, protector, wife, business woman and heroine'. The fit and healthy young couple have left their home to recuperate after their frantic night battle. The couple had no significant injuries from the fatal fight, but a detective said they were likely sore because it was 'quite a struggle,' said King County sheriff's Sgt. Cindi West. Buff: The couple owned a nearby gym . Investigators don't believe the residents know the intruder and there's nothing to indicate why the house was attacked. There's no marijuana growing in the home, for example, West said. 'We have not seen anything that would explain why this house was targeted,' she said. Some neighbors speculated the man may have come from a homeless camp in some nearby woods. 'This is a weird deal, just a bizarre case,' West said.","Ken Boonstra, 48, has been identified as the man who broke into a young family's central Washington home and was killed by the wife .

Her current show, which started back in 2002, regularly reaches 3 million viewers per week. Her departure will no doubt be a blow to the network, but does not appear to be at all acrimonious. At least not according to CNBC President Mark Hoffman, who wrote in an internal memo obtained by The Wrap: . 'Her motto “People first, then money, then things” resonates not only through our hallways but through the universe. 'I want to personally thank Suze for her friendship and for her incredible contributions to CNBC. 'Please join me in wishing Suze the very best in the future.' In addition to her success on TV, Orman has spent years making it to the new York Times bestsellers list with her financial self-help books. Orman has written nine such books that made it to the list. PBS has turned eight of them into TV specials. Suze Orman's Money Wars will likely premier sometime in fall 2015.

"Lawmakers and activists are denouncing the Obama administration's collection of phone records for millions of Americans as an Orwellian, outrageous breach of privacy that calls for investigation, while the White House is defending the practice as a 'critical tool' for fighting terrorism. 'From a civil liberties perspective, the program could hardly be any more alarming,' said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director. 'It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.' The ACLU is demanding an investigation into the practice, which Jaffer says is unconstitutional. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the . Senate Intelligence committee, confirmed on Thursday that the Obama . administration has been collecting telephone records of millions of U.S. Verizon customers. The top . secret court order for the telephone records, which was . reported by The Guardian newspaper late Wednesday, is actually a three-month . renewal of an ongoing practice, she said. Spying: The NSA has been getting millions of phone records from Verizon on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order, that was only revealed today . Double bind: Part of the order mandated that Verizon not tell its' customer's about the record transfer nor could they admit that the order existed . Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of . Oregon damned the practice as an 'outrageous breach of Americans' privacy.' The . Obama administration defended the order on Thursday, calling it 'a . critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats.' A . senior administration official said the practice 'does not allow the . government to listen in on anyone’s telephone calls' and 'does not . include the content of any communications or the name of any . subscriber,' but rather 'relates exclusively to metadata, such as a . telephone number or the length of the call.' The order requires Verizon, . one of the nation's largest telecommunications companies, on an . 'ongoing, daily basis' to give the NSA information on all telephone . calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and . other countries. The order was granted by the secret . Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 and is good until . July 19. Because of the lack of distinction, it means that the phone records are not just being collected for suspected terrorists, but the company's entire consumer base. The only restriction set forth in the order seems to be the duration of the exchange. It was approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 and it denoted that it would only hold water until July 19, so just shy of three months. Verizon is believed to have nearly 150million customers across the U.S., all of whom could potentially be affected by the controversial court order. Lashing out: Former Vice President Al Gore called the surveillance 'outrageous', not supporting his fellow Democrats . Timing: The revelation comes the same day as President Obama announced his appointment of Susan Rice (right) to be the new head of the NSA, replacing Tom Donilon (center) This news comes just as the Obama . administration is in the process of explaining itself for secretly . subpoenaing the phone records of journalists at the Associated Press and . Fox News without notifying either organization. That case was tied to a national security leak, and caused uproar from which the Department of Justice is still reeling. In this latest instance of unexplained government spying, the government order gives them records of all calls made from certain numbers, and lists what phone numbers they called and how long the call lasted. The data does not include recordings of the conversation or a transcription of those calls. The Guardian reports that the copy of the order shows that the court ordered Verizon to give the NSA 'all call detail records or 'telephony metadata' created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad'. Wide-reaching: Millions of Verizon customers had their data turned over to the NSA, and it is not known whether similar orders were given to other phone companies as well . These records must 'continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this order'. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, the Custodian of Records shall produce to the National Security Agency (NSA) upon service of this Order, and continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this Order....an electronic copy of the following tangible things: all call detail records or ""telephony metadata"" created by Verizon for communications (i) between the United States and abroad; or (ii) wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls. Telephony metadata includes comprehensive communications routing information,. including but not limited to session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number... and time and duration of call. Telephony metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication, as defined by 18 U.S.C. ? 2510(8), or the name, address, or financial information of a subscriber or customer. The secret nature of the order means that Verizon was forbidden to disclose the nature of the order and the existence of the order itself. As such, there is no way of knowing whether similar orders have been put upon other telephone carriers, making the web of possible victims unlimited. An expert in electronic freedom practices says that it was unlikely that Verizon would be the only subject of such an order and that the other major carriers probably had similar orders against them. 'That's not the society we've built in the United States,' said Kurt Opsahl, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is suing the NSA over surveillance inside the country. 'It's not the society we set forth in the Constitution, and it's not the society we should have.' He isn't the only one reacting to the news, as former Vice President Al Gore took to Twitter to call the revelation 'obscenely outrageous'. His decision to come forward is an important one, as he served for two terms under former President Bill Clinton, who will most likely remain silent because of his close association with President Obama- particularly as his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the likely 2016 Democratic nominee for President. Looking back, Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall warned that the government was abusing their privileges when it came to spying. The two men, who sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee, cryptically warned that there would be backlash should any of the federal tricks be revealed. 'When the American people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the Patriot Act, they are going to be stunned and they are going to be angry,' they wrote in a joint letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in 2012. 'As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows.' Warning: Senators Mark Udall (left) and Ron Wyden (right) wrote a letter warning the Attorney General that there would be public outcry should the government's actions become public . The American Civil Liberties Union . put out an immediate statement calling for an end to the program - which . is scheduled to run until July 19 - and a investigation into the order. 'From a civil liberties perspective, . the program could hardly be any more alarming,' ACLU deputy legal . director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement. 'It’s a program in which some untold . number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance . of government agents. 'It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.' The order is the first concrete evidence that U.S. intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under President George W. Bush and caused great controversy when it was first exposed. In 2005, the New York Times reported that the NSA was wiretapping Americans without warrants on international calls. Los Angeles Times and USA Today later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls. In addition, a former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, said that a room accessible only with NSA clearance in the carrier's main San Francisco hub received perfect copies of all transmissions. Verizon is the second biggest U.S. telephone company behind AT&T in terms of revenue. The vast majority of Verizon's overseas operations come from its acquisition of MCI Communications, which is also covered by the order although foreign-to-foreign calls are exempted from it.","A copy of a secret order shows that the National Security Agency ordered Verizon to hand over millions of phone records with no explanation .

"Jackie McNamara will be at Hampden on Saturday aiming to pen a footballing fairytale with a Dundee United team chasing a first Scottish League Cup victory since 1980. But it’s not that long ago the 41-year-old was dreaming of the silver screen and not silverware after co-writing a pilot episode of a ribald sitcom called The Therapy Room. McNamara’s younger brother, Donny - a tiler to trade - played the lead role of Peter Tully, a working-class Scottish Junior player catapulted into a world of WAGs and money after joining a fictional English Premier League club. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara (right) holds the Scottish League Cup ahead of the weekend . United will face Aberdeen in the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup at Hampden this weekend . Gary Lewis, who starred in Billy Elliot and Gangs of New York, played the manager while Still Game actor Frank Gilhooley - who co-wrote the project - portrayed the chairman. Nine episodes were drafted in total by McNamara in 2011 in the twilight of his playing days before he went on to manage Partick Thistle and then United. Drawing heavily on his playing career with Dunfermline, Celtic and this weekend’s opponents Aberdeen, the pilot was never picked up by a television studio. However, screen-writing remains a hobby of McNamara’s to this day - and even if The Therapy Room had been a roaring success he still doesn’t believe it would have taken him off the path that led towards Saturday’s last-four clash. ‘If The Therapy Room had been picked up would I be sitting here today? Absolutely, yes,’ said the 41-year-old boss with a smile. ‘I did all that before I started on my coaching badges. I was doing it as a book. A lot of former players do biographies or autobiographies and it was kind of my way of doing certain things in a certain way. I don’t believe you can do a biography without hurting people! Not if you want to be honest, anyway. McNamara co-wrote the pilot episode of a sitcom named The Therapy Room before becoming a coach . ‘It was just a side track, for me. It was escapism. But it’s something I might go back to. I have gathered a lot more material since then. I’ve certainly dealt with a lot more characters! ‘I still write little notes here and there to this day, as I did as a player. But I don’t sit down and write scripts just now, no.’ With his ability to pen dialogue, is McNamara ever tempted to write and perform a Churchillian speech before a big match like this one at Hampden? ‘I don’t script my team-talks, no,’ he said. ‘Everything I do or say to the players before a game or at half-time has not been written down. The stuff I don’t remember from matches I don’t see as important. ‘Instead, I do little team-talks, speaking to each player individually or to small groups of players. When I was a player, a manager would go through the whole team on the tactics board. ‘But if he was talking to defence alone, the midfield and forwards didn’t have his attention. They’d be looking at their boots. McNamara (left) and Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes (right) stand with the cup at Hampden Park . ‘So I try to get it so I’ve got their attention and I know they’re listening. Whether it’s the two full-backs and who they’re up against, or how the striker or strikers should be moving up front. It’s just the way I like to do it. Whether that’s right or wrong, who knows?’ For McNamara, the manager’s office at Tannadice has emerged as his very own Therapy Room, or certainly one in need of a psychiatrist’s couch. Because his team could be said to suffer from a split personality. A thrilling attacking unit they may be, but after beating Celtic they’re just as likely to lose to St Johnstone; or dish out an historic 6-2 thumping to fierce rivals Dundee and then draw at Partick Thistle or with lowly St Mirren. In his role as manager and amateur psychologist, McNamara - who won four leagues, and each domestic cup three times at Celtic - is trying to weed out the fear he believes hampers his side’s performances. It’s one that presents a clear and present danger to Tangerine dreams of winning the League Cup for the first time in 35 years. He said: ‘For me, the biggest thing is the mental side of it, the expectation and the fear. There’s a difference between expectation and actually being able to handle it. ‘When we drew with St Mirren recently, I felt fear and negativity in our play. We were in good positions and the ball ended up back at our goalkeeper. That comes from fear. Dundee United players celebrates after Chris Erskine (hidden) scored against bitter rivals Dundee . ‘When I came in two years ago, we could not win at home. We’d only won two games in the first bit of the season until we won at home to Rangers in my first match. ‘Now we’re winning most of our matches at home but struggling at times away from home. It’s about trying to create an environment where there is no change playing home or away. And that, I believe, is about mentality. ‘It’s about getting the balance between fear and expectation right. We need to handle it and be positive. For instance, our younger players have not experienced that (fear). They don’t think about expectation. They just go out and play like normal. That’s refreshing. It’s what I want to see.’ Despite their mental frailties, McNamara points out that his team still have a tendency to rise to the big occasion. As such, he rates Saturday’s match with an Aberdeen side unbeaten in their last nine games as being too close to call. ‘We’ve handled the big games well,’ said McNamara, who is set to hand former Hearts defender Ryan McGowan a debut to remember against the Dons. (From left) Celtic's Ronny Deila, Rangers' Kenny McDowall, QTS managing director Alan McLeish, Aberdeen's McInnes and Dundee United's McNamara stand and pose with the Scottish League Cup at Hampden . ‘But we’ve been in winning positions against Partick Thistle and St Johnstone and dropped crucial points which have cost us in terms of our league position. ‘We dropped five points in those games and another two at St Mirren but we have nine wins out of 11 at home. Aberdeen are the only team to beat us at Tannadice this season. ‘Aberdeen have had a terrific season so far and they’ve done consistently well, especially when it comes to not conceding. ‘But we’re just three points behind them and I believe we’ve done well to hang in there with them. On Saturday, it will all be down to whoever does better on the day.’ McNamara’s screenwriting days may be temporarily behind him - but he hasn’t given up on scripting some happy endings with United.","Dundee United face Aberdeen in Scottish League Cup  on Saturday .

"The Codex Zacynthius is regarded as a crucial text in studying the development of the New Testament. It features a sixth or seventh century script which has been partially scraped away and written over to make way for a 13th century entry. Now scholars are hoping to uncover this hidden script after securing over £1 million to keep it at a British university. Scroll down for video . The Codex Zacynthius is regarded as an important text in studying the development of the New Testament as it features an seventh century script which has been scraped away  to make way for a 13th century entry . The Codex Zacynthius' future had been in doubt after the British and Foreign Bible Society, which has owned the volume for more than 200 years, decided to sell it to raise funds. But the Cambridge University Library, which has housed the manuscript since 1984, has secured £1.1 million ($1.78 million) to buy it. Dr Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury who supported the fundraising campaign, welcomed the news, saying it would allow further study. 'The discovery and identification of the undertext represents a fascinating detective story,' he said. 'By securing the manuscript, we hope that multi-spectral imaging techniques will enable scholars to recover fully the hidden text.' The Codex Zacynthius showing the end of a chapter of the Evangeliarium, the undertext is clearly legible. Scholars hope to uncover hidden Bible secrets after raising funds to secure the future of the manuscript . Codex Zacynthius is a palimpsest: a manuscript from which the text has been scraped or washed off in order for it to be used again. The recycling of manuscripts was common practice at a time when writing surfaces were precious and few books were produced. The 176 leaves of Codex Zacynthius are made of vellum – treated animal hide. The surface of the vellum was first used in the 6th or 7th century when it was inscribed in Greek with the text of Luke 1:1–11:33. In the 13th century this was partially scraped away and written over with the text of an Evangeliarium, a book composed of passages from the Four Gospels’. The palimpsest offers scholars a key to understanding the way in which the text of St Luke’s Gospel was transmitted as Christianity spread. It measures 35 cm by 28 cm, is now in a 16th-century Greek-style goatskin binding that shows how the manuscript has been treasured over the centuries. Tiny hand-stitched repairs secure tears in the goatskin and the cover bears traces of a cross and other decorations long since lost. Although the undertext was first deciphered in 1861, it is believed to include errors and it is hoped modern techniques may shed new light on its contents. The recycling of manuscripts was common practice at a time when writing surfaces were precious, few books were produced, and a tiny percentage of the population was literate. Codex Zacynthius features 176 leaves of parchment - treated animal skin - first used at the end of the seventh century when it was inscribed in Greek with the text of Luke 1:1-11:33. In the 13th century this was partially scraped away and written over with the text of an Evangeliarium, a book composed of passages from the four Gospels. For centuries there was no definitive text of the New Testament until the formulation the Textus Receptus in the 16th century. The codex was not used in this version which was based on only six manuscripts and was for centuries the standard printed edition of the New Testament, forming the basis of the original German Luther Bible, despite its known shortcomings. 'The presence of the undertext, first discovered in the 19th century and critical to establishing the transmission of St Luke’s Gospel, places Codex Zacynthius among the top flight of Biblical manuscripts,' said Lord Williams. 'Furthermore, it is the oldest extant New Testament manuscript with a commentary alongside the text, making it a witness to both the development and interpretation of St Luke’s Gospel.' The Codex Zacynthius features 176 leaves of parchment - treated animal skin - first used at the end of the seventh century when it was inscribed in Greek with the text of Luke 1:1-11:33 . Its original place of composition is unknown but it takes its name from the Greek island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante, where it was discovered. The library reached its target to secure the manuscript thanks to a £500,000 ($811,600) grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF). 'The Codex Zacynthius has been part of the UK's heritage for over 200 years and is a truly fascinating and unique object,' said Fiona Talbott, head of NHMF. 'Our trustees felt it was incredibly important that it should be safeguarded so future generations can explore its undiscovered secrets.'

"One New York City woman got the shock of a lifetime after returning home from a recent vacation. Nicole Raef, 28, was handed an order of protection from a process server following her return to her boyfriend's home in the Hamptons after a girls weekend in California. And while she claims this took her completely by surprise, her boyfriend, millionaire investor Brad Zipper, 50, is telling a much different story. End of an era: 28-year-old Nicole Raef (left) got dumped by her boyfriend Brad Zipper (right) with a restraining order . Nowhere to live: Raef was forced to move out of the Hamptons home and NYC townhouse (above) she shared with Raef . 'I was 100 percent shocked,' Raef told the New York Post. “ . 'I was like, ""I don’t understand, who breaks up with someone this way?""' What's worse, having been kicked out of Zipper's Hamptons home and his $4million NYC townhouse, which is located in the city's Little Italy neighborhood, Raef had nowhere to live and even had to resort to pawning her diamond earrings so she could afford a lawyer. Raef also said that while the two had been arguing before she left, they had worked things out. Zipper, in papers he filed, paints Raef in a much different light, and implies their relationship was incredibly tumultuous and at times even abusive. He recalls one incident in which he returned home to find his oven on fire and Raef passed out in the guest room. 'When she woke up, she was delirious and didn’t even remember driving and getting into an accident with my car that night,' he says in the suit.

"Tanning really could be an addiction, and a sign of at least two major psychological issues, scientists have warned. While followers such as 'tanning mom' and the cast of Jersey Shore continue to hit the salons, researchers say they could actually have a serious problem . They found some who engage in excessive tanning may also be suffering from obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and body dysmorphic disorders (BDD). Tan fans: the cast of Jersey Shore are known for their deep colouring - now researchers have called for more research into tanning addiction. The Tanning test the researchers developed is a modified version of substance abuse criteria provided by the 4th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Those who answered yes to two of the four questions on the tanning-specific version of the CAGE alcohol screener were considered to have problematic tanning. Out of 533 tanning BGSU students who took the questionnaire, 31 percent met the criteria for tanning dependence and 12 percent for problematic tanning. In further analysis, being female and screening positive for body dysmorphic disorder and OCD were significantly associated with tanning dependence. 'Tanning mom', the ultra-bronzed mother-of-five, 44, whose real name is Patricia Krentcil, hit headlines last April when she was arrested for taking her then five-year-old daughter, Anna, into a tanning booth. Now it appears she could suffer from serious issues. The new research from Lisham Ashrafioun, a Bowling Green State University Ph.D. student in psychology, and Dr. Erin Bonar, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Addiction Research Center and a BGSU alumna, shows that some who engage in excessive tanning may also be suffering from obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and body dysmorphic disorders (BDD). Ashrafioun and Bonar also looked at whether tanning should be classified as an addiction. 'While more research is needed regarding to idea of tanning as an addiction, this study suggests that some people who tan also experience mental health symptoms that warrant further assessment,' said Bonar. 'Although tanning behavior could be separate and distinct from these concerns, it’s possible that the symptoms of OCD or BDD are contributing to the tanning in some way. 'For these people, prevention messages and public health campaigns may not be as helpful, but further assessment and treatment could be.' Their paper, 'Tanning Addiction and Psychopathology: Further Evaluation of Anxiety Disorders and Substance Abuse,' is currently in press in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology and will be published later this year. Respondents who answered yes to at least three of the eight criteria on the Tanning-DSM were considered tanning dependent. Tanning Mom Patricia Krentcil: researchers say those suffering from tanning addiction could suffer may also be suffering from obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and body dysmorphic disorders (BDD) The Tanning-DSM is a modified version of substance abuse criteria provided by the 4th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Those who answered yes to two of the four questions on the tanning-specific version of the CAGE alcohol screener were considered to have problematic tanning. Out of 533 tanning BGSU students who took the questionnaire, 31 percent met the criteria for tanning dependence and 12 percent for problematic tanning. In further analysis, being female and screening positive for body dysmorphic disorder and OCD were significantly associated with tanning dependence. In the model for problematic tanning, only screening positive for obsessive-compulsive disorder was significantly related. 'It may be that some individuals in our sample engage in excessive tanning because of obsessive thoughts about, or the compulsion to tan, or because tanning is a strategy for relaxation to decrease OCD symptoms,' explained Ashrafioun. 'If problem tanning is conceptualized as an addictive disorder, obsessions and compulsions about tanning may instead represent craving to tan.' The odds of meeting the screening criteria for problematic tanning and tanning dependence was strongest for participants who tanned at least nine times in the past 30 days. Tanning could be a real addiction, the team say . 'We have tanning addiction in the title, but we don’t jump to the conclusion automatically that tanning is and can be an addiction,' Ashrafioun said. 'We’re saying that we shouldn’t necessarily rule this out especially if people are tanning excessively, even if they aren’t experiencing any OCD or body dysmorphic disorder. 'Because of this problem we should look at the potential for tanning addiction more.' 'We see this as more potential evidence and firepower for continuing to research the conceptualizing of excessive tanning as an addiction,' Ashrafioun said. 'Previously, clinicians educated patients on the harms of tanning. 'It’s probably more than that – most people know there are harms, but they continue to do it. 'We need to be more focused on intervention than just telling people it’s bad for them.'","Researchers say sufferers have obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and body dysmorphic disorders (BDD)

"A judge cut the sentence of an illegal immigrant and drug dealer yesterday to help him escape deportation. Vincent . Miller was kicked out of the UK twice but managed to return and stay for more than a decade by stealing the identities of British citizens. Yet . when the 33-year-old was sentenced, the judge said sending him home to . Jamaica would be ‘devastating’ for his three children. Judge Farook Ahmed made his decision on Miller's case during proceedings at Inner London Crown Court yesterday, claiming if he was to be deported it would be 'devastating' for his children . Incredibly, . he deliberately shortened the sentence Miller would have received from . a year to 11 months. Criminals given 12 months face automatic . deportation proceedings. Recorder . Farook Ahmed told Miller: ‘The sentence I have had in mind was 12 . months, but it seems to me that it isn’t necessary for me to pass a . sentence of 12 months because a sentence of 11 months will have the same . effect, and it would take away . the automatic triggering of deportation. I have taken into account that . if you were to be deported it is bound to have a devastating effect on . your three children, who I’m told are lawfully here in the UK.’ The judge’s decision provoked a fierce backlash. Sir . Andrew Green, chairman of the pressure group Migrationwatch, said: . ‘This raises serious questions about the attitude of the judiciary . towards the whole question of removing from Britain those who no longer . have a right to be here. ‘To shorten the sentence of a criminal so as to allow him to stay simply beggars belief.’ Tory . MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The sentence should be tailored to fit the . crime, not avoid Parliament’s rules on deportation which are there to . protect the public.’ Stolen identity: Vincent Miller was able to apply for a passport using somebody else's name. This allowed him to stay in the UK for ten years . The case follows a string of outrages where the Human Rights Act has blocked deportation on family grounds. Criminals have been permitted to stay even where they do not have children or a wife, but only a girlfriend. Miller arrived in Britain at Christmas in 2000 when he was given permission to stay for only four days. He . did not return home and was arrested and deported in February 2001 only . to return that Easter under a stolen identity. Within two years he was . deported for supplying class A drugs. From . abroad he successfully applied for a new passport in the name of . another man, Joseph Roche, who had no idea his identity had been stolen. That second identity crime allowed him to obtain a driving licence and . start work as a barber. As a result of his fraud, his wife and their three children, aged two, four and six, were able to claim UK citizenship. His . crimes were uncovered only when the real Mr Roche applied for a . replacement driving licence, and DVLA officials realised two people were . claiming to be the same man. Miller, of Herne Hill in South East . London, was arrested on July 5 and claimed he had given up Mr Roche’s . identity some time earlier. He later pleaded guilty to possessing another person’s identity . document, three counts of conspiring to obtain property by deception and . three counts of dishonestly making a false representation. Anyone sentenced to more than a year in prison is automatically considered for deportation by the UK Border Agency. But . the judge at Inner London Crown Court said he would reduce the intended . sentence to allow Miller to stay in the country and look after his . children. 'Beyond belief': Sir Andrew Green, left, slammed the judge's decision, while Dominic Raab said that sentences should fit crimes, not the deportation rules .

"Bill Cosby, pictured on stage last week, has refused to discuss sexual assault allegations against him . The author of a new Bill Cosby biography is apologizing for not pursuing allegations that the comedian had drugged and sexually assaulted numerous women. Mark Whitaker, whose Cosby: His Life and Times was published in September, tweeted on Monday that he was wrong not to 'aggressively' look into the charges and promised to address them 'at the appropriate time'. 'If true the stories are shocking and horrible,' wrote Whitaker, whose account was confirmed by his New York-based publisher, Simon & Schuster. Whitaker's apology came in response to New York Times reporter David Carr's criticism tha the ignored the allegations across several decades which were levied at the performer. Reports about Cosby have been public knowledge for years, but resurfaced last month after a video of comedian Hannibal Buress calling Cosby a rapist went viral. With several additional women accusing Cosby of assaulting them, projects on NBC and Netflix have been canceled, and TV Land decided not to air reruns of The Cosby Show. Cosby, 77, has issued a statement denying the accusations and called them 'innuendo'. His lawyer Martin Singer has branded the stories 'completely illogical' and added that the claims are 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity'. In a statement released on Friday, he said: 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity. 'These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.' Whitaker's book has been widely criticized for idealizing Cosby, until recently one of the country's most beloved entertainers, although some critics praised it upon release. Amazon.com included 'Cosby' among its best books of September and top 100 biographies and memoirs of 2014. The book includes blurbs from David Letterman, Jerry Seinfeld and Mary Tyler Moore. Scroll down for video . Mark Whitaker (right), whose Cosby: His Life and Times was published in September (left), tweeted on Monday that he was wrong not to 'aggressively' look into the charges . Cosby's biographer tweeted this response to a New York Times reporter's criticism of his Cosby biography . 'If I was America's ''sweetheart'' - turning the world on with a smile - then Bill Cosby was and still is our ''best man,''' Moore wrote. 'A revealing, honest look at my favorite comedian,' reads a blurb from Billy Crystal. According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks around 80 per cent of print sales, Cosby has sold around 6,000 copies. It's a small number for a well-publicized book, but not unusual in an increasingly tight market for hardcover nonfiction, which has been hurt by the decline of physical stores. As of midday on Tuesday, Cosby ranked No. 13,711 on Amazon. Cosby cooperated with Whitaker, agreeing to be interviewed. But, according to Simon & Schuster, Cosby had no control over the book's contents. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel  (pictured right) said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner. Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties. Michelle Hurd: The 47-year-old actress, best known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. In a Facebook post this weekend, she described being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things became too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, ""No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened'''. Joyce Emmons: The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault. Lachele Covington: The 20-year-old actress, who’d been an extra on the TV show Cosby, filed a police report in March 2000 against the star, accusing him of making an unwelcome sexual advance. According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed.","Mark Whitaker's Cosby: His Life and Times was published in September .

"Most of us could probably name at least one of the paintings below - but wait, where have all the people gone? For these are some of the greatest works of art by some of the world's greatest artists, but thanks to a little modern technology, Hungarian artist Bence Hajdu has stripped the paintings of their evocative characters. It leaves us us with static, bleak, yet strangely fascinating portraits - just without any people in them. So now we can see what happens when the disciples get bored with their Last Supper and went home, or what Roman ports look like they are drained of people and animals. And instead of getting to witness the Angel Gabriel meeting the Virgin Mary, we get to watch an empty room being empty. Da Vinci's Last Supper (c.1495) ... But all the apostles are gone, just leaving an empty table with a few loafs of bread . ...And they're back! The disciples and Jesus finally make their party, and promptly make a mess of their freshly-laid table . But once stripped of people, the paintings take on a new life: we get to focus on the rooms themselves, the geometry of the space, and the atmosphere of each room. For instance, in the Oath of the Horatii, painted by Jacques-Louis David in 1784, we originally witnessed a tense scene where three Roman brothers from the Horatius family are preparing to duel against the Curiatii family, in a bid to settle a war between the two cities. The original painting shows us a clash of emotions - the tension of the upcoming battle, the patriotic expressions of the brothers, the sadness of the watching mother and sisters who know that death is in the air. But, stripped of the people, we get a quiet room, in stillness, unused and unwitnessed. The arches and pillars loom in silence and darkness. Oath of the Horatii (1784) by French artist Jacques-Louis David tells the story of three Roman brothers trying to end a war of three cities by going into battle against another set of siblings. But in this version, they all simply went home. That's what we were expecting! The brothers are returned to their rightful positions, and prepare to begin battle . The ships are present, and by rights this is a bustling sea-port ... but all is eerily silent, the sea undisturbed by man in this re-imagining of Claude's Seaport with the Embarkation of Saint Ursula (1641) Back to bustling: Now we can see St Ursula, holding a flag with her emblem, watching her companions embark on a voyage from the footsteps of Tempietto di San Pietro in Montorio, Rome . Hajdu, a student at the University of Fine Arts, Hungary, told DesignBoom: 'At one of the . descriptive geometry classes we had a task to find and draw the perspective and horizon lines of renaissance and other pictures with . significant perspective space. 'I thought it is not that interesting to just draw lines, so I decided to erase all the characters from them . and examine how the painter really created the perspective space and how it actually looks. 'I saw this could be something exciting and continued thinking and . working on it. 'After a while I found myself . interested in the new atmosphere and the new thoughts the retouched . pieces generated without their main subjects.' Fra Angelico's The Annunciation (c. 1438): In the original painting, the Virgin Mary meets the Angel Gabriel to be told she will give birth to Jesus Christ. However, on this occasion, it seems the painter missed the moment . ...The Virgin Mary finally makes her appointment on the Tuscan-style terrace, and the Angel Gabriel arrives to deliver the announcement of the Immaculate Conception . The Camera degli Sposi ('bridal chamber'), a highly decorated room in the Ducal Palace, Mantua, Italy (painted between 1465 and 1474), has a giant fresco by Andrea Mantegna on the ceiling, from which angels look down - but oh no! - all the angels have vanished... ...But take a look at the original work, and now all the angels are back in this stunning piece of work which took ten years to complete . The Annunciation, by Sandro Botticelli (c.1489), is again meant to show the Virgin Mary receiving a visit from the Angel Gabriel. But again the Italian Renaissance master has appeated to miss the moment. Instead we get simply a bare room . A welcome return: Luckily the Angel comes back to greet the Virgin Mary, allowing Christians to again rejoice in the knowledge Jesus is coming to Earth .",The Last Supper among famous Renaissance works re-imagined as empty scenes by artist Bence Hajdu .
"It represents a unique and quite eye-opening twist on the old ‘show us your medals’ game so beloved in professional football. While Dundee United as a club have had five trophy triumphs to celebrate across 106 years, their current manager, Jackie McNamara, boasts 10 winners’ gongs from just a decade of service at Celtic. Those starkly contrasting totals serve to drive home to McNamara just how fleeting it is for teams outwith Rangers and Celtic to lift silverware. Jackie McNamara insists his Dundee side must make amends for last term's League Cup anguish . And as he prepares his United side to face holders Aberdeen in today’s League Cup semi-final, it also serves to imbue the highly-decorated 41-year-old with fresh desire to avenge the crushing low of last season’s 2-0 Scottish Cup Final loss to St Johnstone. At Celtic Park, McNamara’s band of talented youngsters wilted in the May heat, blowing their big chance to capture the trophy for just the third time in Tannadice history. For the United boss, the regrets remain. But he wants his side to make amends by seizing the day against the Dons this afternoon and moving one step closer to the Tayside club’s first League Cup success since 1980. McNamara is happy the Rangers vs Celtic has taken the top billing for the League Cup semi-final . ‘The chance to win trophies doesn’t come around all that often, so you need to grasp it,’ said McNamara. ‘But last season, after Celtic had been knocked out of the Scottish Cup, we didn’t manage to do that. ‘Scottish football has changed a lot in the last four or five years and the gulf isn’t as big as it possibly should have been. The gap is still there in terms of budgets but, when it comes to quality, it’s not as big as it should be. So it was a real chance for us last season. ‘Could I have done anything differently? Yes, you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t make mistakes. ‘I make mistakes every day and so do players. I’m always learning and I learned from last season. Disappointments makes you stronger and hopefully good things will come from it. ‘But, to be honest, I tend not to look at the past. As a player, I won finals and lost finals. And, when you win, it’s all about winning the next one. When you lose, it’s about going again. Dundee United are looking to reach the Scottish Cup final again and do themselves justice on the day . ‘For me, we did well to reach the Scottish Cup final but just didn’t do ourselves justice on the day. So the important thing for us is to get back there – and not leave anything behind this time.’ McNamara does not wholly subscribe to the view that the fall of Rangers represents a limited window of opportunity for clubs like United. The theory goes that the Ibrox club – as unlikely as it seems in these present times - will one day get their act together off the park, making it more unlikely for trophies to end up at Tannadice. For the United boss – who has a track record of unearthing low-cost gems like Andy Robertson and Charlie Telfer – it depends on how you manage your resources. ‘Whether it’s a window of opportunity remains to be seen,’ he said. ‘It all depends on what happens there and at Celtic, as well. Rangers still have a budget that dwarves ours – and Aberdeen’s, as well. So I don’t see that as a given. ‘If you look at when we beat Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final last year, they dwarfed our budget then. ‘We were playing kids like Ryan Gauld and John Souttar, who we’d brought through the youth system. It’s about how you use the resources, and about having a structure in place for the future.’ McNamara proves a touch sheepish when recalling his first League Cup win with Celtic. Jeff Holmes is looking to guide Dundee United to Hampden Park with a win against Aberdeen . ‘It was against Dundee United at Ibrox (in 1997),’ he said. But he was more forthcoming about his love of playing at Hampden during his career, especially scoring the opener in a 3-0 Scottish Cup final win over Hibs. And he urged his players to fulfil their dreams at the national stadium against an Aberdeen side he considers favourites. ‘I loved playing at Hampden,’ he continued. ‘As a kid, you dream of playing here and scoring in finals. I was fortunate enough to do it at Celtic and there’s no better feeling. I want my players to live the moments I had as a player. I’m effectively like a schoolteacher passing on bits of wisdom and belief. ‘I’m sure that every kid still dreams of playing and scoring at Hampden in a cup final, never mind a semi. So the big thing for us on Saturday is to get the win which will take us to the final. Henri Anier looks ahead to his side's crucial cup clash against Aberdeen . ‘I think Aberdeen go into it as favourites because they won it last year and they have a bit more experience in their squad – guys like Niall McGinn, Willo Flood and Barry Robson, who have been at Celtic. ‘We only have one or two who have the experience of winning trophies. It will be about getting them to settle down, not think about the occasion too much and just to play their normal game.’ McNamara is happy the Rangers v Celtic match tomorrow has taken top billing over today’s encounter which is likelier to be a better, closer contest. ‘Not at all,’ he said when asked about whether it bothered him. ‘When the draw was made, no one spoke about our game because the Old Firm have not played for a few seasons. ‘If anything, it has made our game a bit more low key, which is fine. The players are not as nervous about it as much. I’ll probably watch the other game in the house on Sunday. It is probably better to stay out the way.’ Nor is McNamara worried about the prospect of United fans being outnumbered by up to three to one at Hampden. ‘Aberdeen have fantastic backing, they’re a one team city and they won the cup last year,’ he said. ‘It’s a bit less for us because we have two teams in the city. ‘But we will still have a healthy crowd coming down. Hopefully we can send them back up the road happy and then we will have even greater numbers for the final.’","Jackie McNamara insists Dundee United must make amends for final flop .

"A school named after a heroic pilot who gave his life to save hundreds of pupils has changed its name - provoking fury among pupils and parents. The Sanders Draper School in Hornchurch, Essex, was named after Raimund Sanders Draper - whose RAF fighter was heading for the building when his engine suddenly cut out at 200ft. He heroically crashed his Spitfire into the school's playing fields - and only its wing hit the building. The Sanders Draper School in Hornchurch, Essex, changed its name in 1973 to honour the heroic pilot who narrowly avoided hitting the school. Controversially, it is now going to be called Sanders School . Draper, 29, who'd just taken off from nearby RAF Hornchurch, died to save over 650 pupils and staff at the school. The crash happened just before 11am on March 24, 1943, at the height of the Second World War - and Draper's noble sacrifice has never been forgotten locally. Formerly known as Suttons Senior School, the school was renamed Sanders Draper in 1973 on the 30th anniversary of his death. Flying Officer Raimund Sanders Draper - who crashed his Spitfire into the school's playing fields to avoid killing hundreds of pupils . A plaque at the school marks the point of impact and its badge features a Spitfire to honour the father-of-one's incredible courage. But now, controversially, it will be known as Sanders School. It comes just weeks after another school, which was named after a Second World War hero, changed its name. The John Baskeyfield VC Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was renamed Saint Nathaniel’s after it became an academy. Today, Linda France, 68, of Hornchurch, said: 'I think it's absolutely disgusting and disrespectful to this brave man to now just name the school Sanders and change its school badge. I find it totally offensive. 'There are some of the children that this hero saved still alive - they must feel the name change is an insult to Sanders Draper and his existing family.' Mrs France, whose two sons attended the school, added: 'This is a very sad day for Hornchurch and RAF history.' Roy Marrable, 83, who was at the school on the day of the tragic drama, has criticised the decision. Mr Marrable, who now lives in York and has early-stage Alzheimer's, hit out through his son Gerald. Gerald, 57, of Kingston-on-Thames, south-west London, said: 'My dad is very disappointed the school has done this. 'If they are starting afresh there are more important things to do than changing the name. They should be very proud of this heroic man. 'My dad used to go down every year to lay flowers at Sanders' cemetery. That day is still fresh in his mind even though he's now in his 80s.' Local parents also blasted the decision on a local newspaper's Facebook page. A artist's impression of the crash. One former pupils said today they were 'disappointed' at the change . Donna Slate said: 'It's definitely disrespectful. My girls go there and have been informed they have to have their badges changed on their uniforms. 'I cannot understand why they have changed the name. It's a stupid idea and won't make the school any different.' Havering in Pictures said: 'This is extremely disrespectful. I've visited Raimund Sanders Draper's grave (to give him his full name) many times and am always in awe of what he did and the ultimate sacrifice he made. 'There doesn't seem to be any reason for the change that I can see either. Change it back I say.' John McEachern, headteacher of the school which has about 950 pupils aged from 11-16, said in March 2013: 'The school is extremely proud of its association with Raimund Sanders Draper and his bravery and sacrifice. 'We will certainly hope to continue to honour the memory of this heroic pilot in the school for many years to come.' Two Spitfires (the P7350 at the front and the Hurricane LF363) during the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight in 2010. One parent said the change was 'disrespectful' But he said last week after the renaming ceremony: 'The renaming was a part of the continuing drive to become an outstanding centre of learning. 'The new school emblem, name and badge all connect together to create a strong brand image for this school that is dynamic and forward looking. 'I am extremely proud of the staff and students who have led this momentous event in the school's history.' Ken Finding and Jim Ring, who were pupils at the school when Flying Officer Draper was killed, set up the Suttons-Sanders Draper World War II Schoolboys Association in his memory. A celebration of the school's 75th anniversary last year - which was attended by some of the pilot's family . The group organised an annual memorial service at St Andrew's Church, Hornchurch, where he is buried. Mr Ring, 84, said last year: 'Every year we celebrate Sanders Draper's sacrifice for us boys. 'It could have been full of fuel exploding, an awful lot dead - there were 650 pupils at the school at the time plus the staff.' London-born Flying Officer Draper, dubbed 'Smudge' by his mates, was an American volunteer fighting in the RAF's 64 Squadron. He was the younger son of American interior decorator, writer, and hostess Muriel Draper. Last month, a primary school named in honour of a Second World War hero who was killed in action changed its name. John Baskeyfield VC Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was placed in special measures in 2012. It then became an Academy earlier this year. As a result trustees decided earlier this month to rename it Saint Nathaniel’s Academy because they believed its previous name was associated with its own ‘legacy of failure’ But angry parents, historians and relatives of the gallant soldier - who sacrificed his life for his country 70 years ago at the age of just 21 - have hit out at the move and branded it an insult to his memory.","Sanders Draper School in Hornchurch, Essex, has changed its name .

"Sentenced: Sandy Nguyen, 29, pleaded guilty to charitable fraud and child abuse after the scam . A mother who lied about her son having cancer to more than $25,000 in charitable contributions will serve five years of probation and spend 90 nights in jail on work release. Sandy Nguyen, from Aurora, Colorado, was sentenced on Tuesday after pleading guilty to one count each of charitable fraud and child abuse,KUSA reported. Police say she convinced her six-year-old son, family and others in the community that the boy had bone cancer and had been receiving treatment since about September 2012. At the time of her arrest in March, she was pregnant and her child was taken away from her in light of the criminal case - although it is not yet known if she will get her children back. She started falsely telling members of her community that the boy had been diagnosed the previous April with 'an aggressive, rare, stage 3 childhood bone cancer and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia'. There were even times the boy and everyone else believed he'd gone into remission and once when Nguyen, 29, allegedly said the 'he probably only had 8 more months with them'. The community also held a 5K charity walk for the boy. The event's page notes that he was 'fighting cancer for the 3rd time'. Photos from Nguyen's Facebook page also reportedly showed a boy both with hair and a bald head, as if he had endured chemotherapy. The page has since been removed. Scam: She raised thousands of dollars and used some of the money to take her family to Disneyland . Various community and school fundraisers raised some $25,000 for the family, and police say Nguyen used some of the money to pay for a family trip to Disneyland. But the scheme began to unravel after a doctor at Children's Hospital of Denver's oncology unit overheard her talking about her son but did not recognize his name. After checking records at the hospital, investigators found out the youngster hadn't been treated for cancer at the hospital, but that he had seen doctors for less serious ailments. Arapahoe County Sheriff's investigators executed a search warrant at Nguyen's home, recovering about $23,000 in cash. Her defense lawyer said that all of the money was recovered and that none of it had been raised for her personal gain. At her sentencing hearing, Nguyen's defense team said the scam began after the young boy was diagnosed with a skin condition and that she had never intended to deceive people, CBS reported. Tricked: She claimed she never intended to deceive people but didn't discourage them from thinking that her son had cancer either, she said. She gave birth after her arrest and is now fighting to get her kids back . 'We don't have any reason to believe that anyone other than her knew the truth,' Arapahoe County Sheriff's Captain Larry Etheridge told KMGH following her arrest earlier this year. 'The little boy believed he had cancer. The rest of the family believed he had cancer.' The child's principal, Darla Thompson, informed parents of the situation in a letter after the allegations emerged, writing: 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community. 'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case.

"The Great War broke out on her 14th birthday and during the horrific conflict she would lose one of her beloved brothers. But despite her tender years Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother was determined to play her own part in the First World War at her Scottish childhood home. Glamis in Angus was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers and the then Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon would write letters for injured soldiers and run errands from the local shops for them. Regal: The teenaged Queen Elizabeth (back row, third from right) with some of the soldiers she cared for during the First World War. One brother was killed during the war and another was a prisoner of war . After the death of her brother Fergus, which severely affected her mother Lady Strathmore, Lady Elizabeth took on even more care duties. She even saved the castle from being burned down - more than fulfilling her mother's maxim that 'duty is the rent you pay for life.' Now pictures of the future Queen Elizabeth playing her part in the First World War have gone on show at the only home she actually ever owned as part of a new exhibition. Fittingly the exhibition at the Castle of Mey in Caithness show the photographs of the teenage Lady Elizabeth at war as part of a display with locals from the county she would later in life call her home. Caring: After the death of her brother Fergus, which severely affected her mother Lady Strathmore, the then Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon took on even more care duties . The tiny island of Stroma in the Pentland Firth off Mey - where Prince Charles loves to paint - is remembered with extra poignancy. At the turn of the century Stroma's population was just 375 and 31 men were sent to war. Six of those men died, including three lodgers in one house who had joined the Seaforth Highlanders. By 1961 the population fell to just 12 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year. The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants, who uses it to graze the cattle and sheep which are now its only occupants. But it is the images of a young Lady Elizabeth that in a way capture the spirit of an age where everybody - no matter who you were, or how old - contributed to the war effort. They are also a revealing insight into the care and compassion of the future wife of George VI - whose stoicism and compassion would become an enduring symbol of the Second World War. The exhibition - which has taken a year to put together - has been curated by Christine Shearer, whose father the late Reverend George Bell was for 21 years the Church of Scotland Minister at Canisbay where Queen Elizabeth worshipped for almost 50 years. 'The Queen Mother knew the pain of the First World War. Her elder brother, Fergus, an officer in the Black Watch Regiment, was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in 1915,' she said. 'Another brother, Michael, who they called Mikey, was reported missing in action two years later,' said Mrs Shearer. 'Three weeks later, the family discovered that he had been captured after being wounded and he remained a prisoner of war in Germany for the rest of the war. The Castle of Mey is located in Caithness, on the north coast of Scotland, about six miles west of John o' Groats . Gratitude: This image is from Queen Elizabeth's personal autograph book, which was signed by some of the soldiers. 'Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. 'Though she was too young to serve as a nurse, she did assist her parents in their efforts to support the war. I found it very emotional and moving putting the exhibition together. 'It is is clear that the care and compassion that the Queen Mother had was in many ways forged during this period.' As well as caring for the troops Lady Elizabeth also played a major part in the rescue of the castle's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916. The teenager wears a nurse's uniform in this photograph. Exhibition curator Christine Shearer said: 'It is is clear that the care and compassion that the Queen Mother had was in many ways forged during this period' Two soldiers discovered a fire in a room under the castle roof. As they ran to raise the alarm, the first person they came across was Lady Elizabeth who kept calm and immediately telephoned both the local and Dundee fire brigades. She then marshalled everyone to fight the fire, organising a chain to bring buckets of water from the river. Later, with the fire raging above them, she organised the removal of the valuables out onto the lawn. One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be 'hung, drawn, & quartered... Hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach and four, and quartered in the best house in the land'. The war began during a moment of happiness for the young Elizabeth. As she celebrated her 14th birthday on 4 August 1914 en route to a vaudeville show in London the streets suddenly filled with people, cheering and waving flags. Then, at the end of the show, the theatre manager came onto the stage to announce that war had been declared on Germany that very evening. Soon after, Lady Elizabeth, her mother and her sister Lady Rose, returned to Glamis where the castle was converted to a convalescent home for wounded soldiers. 'She immersed herself in their care and welfare. This was to be her role throughout the war and her kindness won the admiration of many of the soldiers who passed through Glamis,' said Mrs Shearer. 'She even did not want the furniture moved about too much because she wanted the men to feel that they were at home. She would run errands, including getting their tobacco from the local shop. 'But after the death of Fergus she took on more duties because her mother was so distraught. 'The mental scars of those who fought and survived must have been terrible. I think the whole experience of the First World War affected Elizabeth greatly. Four of her brothers served in the army. 'Her compassion and kindness was something that stayed with her all her life. She was an incredible and remarkable lady.' In 1918 the armistice signalled the end of the war and the end of an era. Once the last soldier had left Glamis in 1919 Lady Elizabeth was launched into the high society of the day at her coming out party. A letter to Lady Strathmore from her son Fergus, who was killed while serving in the Black Watch, telling of his impending wedding and that he intended to ask his brother Jock to be best man . Fergus married on 17 September 1914. He was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in 1915 . While at a ball in London, Lady Elizabeth caught the eye of Prince Albert once again when he saw her dancing with his equerry James Stuart. Lady Elizabeth later refused his first two proposals and after accepting the third, a delighted prince sent a telegraph to his parents that simply said 'Alright - Bertie.' They married in April 1923. The exhibition is being staged in the chauffeur's cottage at the Castle of Mey. Having acquired the most northerly castle on the British mainland, Queen Elizabeth renovated and restored it and also created beautiful walled gardens. Duty: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother unveils the memorial at St Clement Danes of Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris in 1992 . Queen Elizabeth first saw what was then Barrogill Castle in 1952, while mourning the death of her husband, King George VI. Falling for its ruined isolated charm, and hearing it was to be abandoned, she declared: 'Never! It's part of Scotland's heritage. I'll save it.' With the encouragement of Prince Charles, two new 'E' shaped rose beds have been created in the walled garden - a fitting memorial to his grandmother's love of roses. The castle is closed for the week while Charles is in residence - an annual stay he started after his beloved grandmother died aged 101 in 2002.","New exhibition shows how royal cared for those hurt in conflict .

"Atheist: Richard Dawkins made the comments during a debate on Twitter with some of his followers . Richard Dawkins risked provoking fury today by claiming foetuses with Down's syndrome should be aborted - and parents should 'try again'. The controversial comments from the scientist, who is a vocal atheist, came during a debate on Twitter with some of his 1million followers. A discussion began when Professor Dawkins posted a link to an article in liberal US magazine New Republic entitled 'The Catholic Church prefers medieval barbarism to modern abortion'. Professor Dawkins, 73, said: 'Ireland is a civilised country except in this one area. You'd think the Roman Church would have lost all influence.' In response, Irish Catholic fitter Aidan McCourt asked him: '994 human beings with Down's syndrome deliberately killed before birth in England and Wales in 2012. Is that civilised?' Professor Dawkins said: 'Yes, it is very civilised. These are foetuses, diagnosed before they have human feelings.' He later added: 'Learn to think in non-essentialist ways. The question is not ""is it 'human'?"" but ""can it suffer?""' Then, he was told by Boston-based writer 'InYourFaceNewYorker': 'I honestly don't know what I would do if I were pregnant with a kid with Down's syndrome. Real ethical dilemma.' Professor Dawkins replied: 'Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice.' But . campaigners and charity workers contested Professor Dawkins's statements, saying . that the disability does not stop people having 'full and rewarding . lives'. Scroll down for video . Comments: A discussion began when Dawkins posted a link to an article in liberal US magazine New Republic entitled 'The Catholic Church prefers medieval barbarism to modern abortion' Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association, told MailOnline: 'People with Down’s syndrome can and do live full and rewarding lives, they also make a valuable contribution to our society. 'At the Down’s Syndrome Association, we do not believe Down’s syndrome in itself should be a reason for termination, however, we realise that families must make their own choice. 'The DSA strives to ensure that all prospective parents are given accurate and up to date information about the condition and what life might be like today for someone with Down’s syndrome.' And the Pro-Life campaign in Ireland said the comments were 'chilling' and 'deeply insulting'. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'These shocking comments by Professor Richard Dawkins are a chilling reminder of how easy it is for society to fall into the trap of deeming some human beings ""imperfect"" and unworthy of life. 'To suggest that unborn babies diagnosed with Down's Syndrome should be discarded through abortion is deeply insulting to children with this special need and their families. Objection: People used tweeted their disgust at Professor Dawkins's comments . 'Cruel': Irish human rights activist Cora Sherlock condemned the comments as wilful controversy . 'No less human': Christian Guy, the head of the Centre for Social Justice think tank, also criticised Dawkins . 'All human beings are entitled to live their lives to the fullest of their capabilities. In a compassionate society, we must work together to put in place the supports and assistance that will make this possible for everyone.' Professor Dawkins's comments come after he said last week that having a faith helped foster terrorism. He suggested those who believe in God enable suicide bombers to murder thousands and make the ‘world safe’ for extremists. And last month he referred to ‘mild date rape’ and ‘mild paedophilia’ in comments on Twitter. Campaigners for women and child abuse victims condemned those posts as ‘offensive and damaging’. He became embroiled in the row when he made a point about logical thinking. Adored: Grace Reynolds, has Down's Syndrome. Her family say her coming into the world has been hard, but immensely rewarding . The father of a one-year-old girl with Down’s Syndrome has told Richard Dawkins aborting his child, as he advocates, would have been ‘the greatest mistake of my life’. Justus Reynolds, from Syracuse, Utah, found out that his daughter, Grace, had the condition shortly after she was born. When he saw the academic’s comments he tweeted back his point of view. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Reynolds said that caring for Grace has ‘made life harder’ but that that it is impossible to measure the joy of being her father. He said: ‘My wife and I found out our baby had Down’s Syndrome just after she was born, I'll be the first to admit that I was heartbroken by the news. ‘I didn't know anything about Down’s Syndrome and really struggled to come to terms with all the dreams that I had for her that likely wouldn't come true. But as I got to know her, those dreams became less important. ‘She has completely changed the dynamic of our family. She has three older siblings, and they completely adore her. She is a complete joy to have in our home. ‘The dreams I have for her now are different than when she was born but I still have dreams. There are tough times, she has health problems related to Down’s Syndrome that will make life harder for all of us, but I wouldn't trade any of that if it meant not getting to know her. Family: Grace, pictured with her father Justus Reynolds and her three siblings hiking in Capital Reef national park, Utah . ‘I don't think it is ""civilized"" to abort a foetus that has Down’s Syndrome to avoid difficulties in the future, because you will also lose any joy that you would have had from having a wonderful child of God as part of your family. ‘Is it easy? Nope. Is it worth every trouble? Yes it is.’ Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that delays a person's growth and causes intellectual disability. The condition was first detailed by English physician John Langdon Down in 1862. He later characterised it as a mental disability in a widely published report in 1866. Most babies with Down's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone, eyes that slant upwards, a low birth weight, a small nose and mouth and short fingers. They also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children. Some children with Down's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders, digestive problems, hearing and visual impairments, thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders. It is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK. It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby's cells. Currently, no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but Down's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers. For example, if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having Down's syndrome, but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby, there is a one in 30 chance of it having Down's syndrome.

"The Congressman who threatened to throw a reporter off the Capitol balcony on camera last night has apologized. Michael Grimm stormed off after NY1 reporter Michael Scotto tried to ask him about a controversy over his campaign finances - but returned to confront the TV news man. He squared up to Scotto and told him 'you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony' before threatening to break Scotto in half 'like a boy'. But today Grimm said he had called Scotto to apologize and said he 'overreacted' when he threatened him with physical violence following the State of the Union address. Scotto posted a message on Twitter Wednesday morning announcing the call, but it comes after Grimm already defended his decision to 'take him to task' after the reporter asked about an ongoing federal investigation into Grimm's campaign finances. The incident was caught on camera, showing how Grimm cut the interview short after refusing to answer questions about the probe. Scroll down for video . Bully pulpit: Rep Michael Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island, was being interviewed by NY1 about the State of the Union address when he became angry with the reporter and threatened him . Off-topic question: NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto attempted to question Grimm about the FBI investigation into his 2010 campaign fundraising, but the politician cut him off and refused to discuss the matter . ‘I'm not speaking to you off-topic, this is only about the President,’ said an irate Grimm before stalking off. ‘So Congressman Michael Grimm does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,’ Scotto said into the camera. That is when Grimm, 43, marched back and confronted a startled-looking Scotto. Although the audio in the clip that captured the exchange is very low, a transcript provided by NY1 . shows that at one point Grimm said to Scott: 'Let me be clear to you, . you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony.’ The reporter attempted to defend himself, pointing out that he simply wanted to ask ‘a valid question.’ In response, Grimm told him: 'No, no, you're not man enough, you're not man enough. I'll break you in half. Like a boy.’ In . the wake of the incident, Grimm released an unapologetic statement . claiming that he was ‘extremely annoyed’ because he was doing NY1 a . favor by agreeing to do their interview first. ‘The . reporter knew that I was in a hurry and was only there to comment on . the State of the Union, but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap . shot at the end of the interview, because I did not have time to speak . off-topic,’ Grimm said. Fit of rage: The 43-year-old retired Marine and former FBI agent went after Scott, threatening to throw him off the balcony . Threat of violence: Grimm (right) was caught on camera telling Scotto: 'I'll break you in half. Like a boy.' Next step: Hours after issuing a statement defending his decision to 'take him to task', Grimm called the reporter and apologized . He continued, saying: ‘I verbally . took the reporter to task and told him off, because I expect a certain . level of professionalism and respect, especially when I go out of my way . to do that reporter a favor. ‘I doubt that I am the first Member of Congress to tell off a reporter, and I am sure I won’t be the last.’ He issued a second statement Wednesday morning: 'I was wrong. I shouldn’t have allowed my emotions to get the better of me and lose my cool.' 'I have apologized to Michael Scotto, which he graciously accepted, and will be scheduling a lunch soon. In the weeks and months ahead I’ll be working hard for my constituents on issues like flood insurance that is so desperately needed in my district post Sandy,' Grimm wrote. A retired U.S. Marine and former FBI agent, Grimm was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 during the wave of Tea Party conservatism. Unapologetic: A defiant Grimm (left) released a statement blaming Scotto (right) for being ungrateful and failing to show him respect by taking a 'cheap shot' at him . NY1 political director Bob Hardt demanded that Grimm issue an apology to Scott, calling his behavior 'extremely disturbing.' Earlier this month, the FBI charged Grimm’s donor Diana Durand with exceeding the maximum allowable contribution to the Republican’s campaign by asking her friends to donate $10,000. Grimm, 47, has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged. The New York Times reported that the politician has faced an investigation into allegations that he or his campaign illegally asked for contributions from foreign donors. This is not the Congressman's first threat of violence, as The New Yorker reported in 2011 that he got into a fight with a man at a Queens nightclub more than a decade earlier. He allegedly said the man 'don’t know who he’s f***ing with...I’ll f***in’ make him disappear where nobody will find him'. The confrontation continued into the club's garage, where a NYPD officer who was working at the club confronted then-FBI agent Grimm after Grimm was holding his gun and threatening the man. 'I’m gonna f***in' kill him...I’m a fucking F.B.I. agent, ain’t nobody gonna threaten me,’ Grimm reportedly said. Grimm later denied saying those statements: 'I don’t need to speak that way. A guy with a gun who knows how to use it doesn’t need to say anything.'","Rep Michael Grimm, 43, of Staten Island, told NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto he will throw him off Capitol balcony .

"More than 100 years after the centuries-old practice of foot binding was banned in China, these are some of the last living women who were subjected to the practice as children. Once a symbol of beauty and status, foot binding, also known as lotus feet, was carried out in China since the 10th century, falling out of favour in the early 20th century before it was outlawed in 1911.

Damage: Many of the foot bones would remain broken for years, but would start to heal as the girl grew older. However they were still prone to repeatedly re-breaking, especially during teenage years when the girl's feet were soft . Risk: Since they could not balance securely, older women who had bound feet were less able to rise from a sitting position and were more likely to fall and break their hips and other bones .

"A letter written by Darren Wilson thanking people who’d supported him since the shooting of Michael Brown in August has been leaked despite the Ferguson police officer asking for it to remain private. In the letter, Wilson said the support and dedication he had received had been 'amazing' and had ‘brought tears to my eyes.’ Wilson also asked his supporters to not pass the letter to the media - but one person disregarded that request in the wake of Monday's decision by a grand jury not to indict him. Scroll down for video . A letter written by Darren Wilson thanking people who’d supported him since the shooting of Michael Brown in August has been leaked despite the Ferguson police officer asking for it to remain private . In the letter, Officer Wilson said that the support and dedication he had received since shooting Michael Brown in August had been 'amazing' and ‘brought tears to my eyes’ The anonymous supporter told KDSK in St. Louis that many of Wilson's supporters have ties to the police and are worried about the violent protests that have followed Monday's verdict. The supporter, who had been in touch with Wilson over the past few months, said the focus of the thousands of people who have been supporting the officer now turns to the law enforcement responding to the violence in Ferguson. In his first televised interview since Monday's verdict, the 28-year-old told ABC News' George Stephanopoulus  that the first time he ever fired his gun in his five-year career as a police officer was the August afternoon he shot dead black teen Michael Brown. Wilson spoke with Stephanopoulos at a secret location less than 24 hours after it was announced that a grand jury decided not to indict him on any charges related to the August 9 shooting. To all of the pro Officer Wilson Supporters - . I would like to thank you all for standing up for me during this stressful time. Your support and dedication is amazing and it is still hard to believe that all of these people that I have never met are doing so much for me. I watched the CNN video we recorded at the rally on Saturday and it brought tears to my eyes. All of you are simply amazing, and I don't know how to thank you all enough. I wish I could attend meet you, hug you, and personally thank you for all of your continued support, however, due to my and my families safety I am unable to. Please don't give this letter to any media or post it where they can see it. Relay the message of thanks to all and keep this letter private until the investigation is complete. I want you all to know that I do get updates on the amount of support. Unfortunately, I don't get to see all of the comments made through social media, but overall messages are relayed to me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, and know that I would do the same for any of you. Also please keep my family in blue in your hearts and prayers, they have all made a sacrifice to their own lives in order to work the excessive hours through the heat and rain to ensure that the riots and protests in Ferguson were as safe as they could be. Thank you, . P.O. Darren Wilson . In his first televised interview since Monday's verdict, the 28-year-old told ABC News ' George Stephanopoulus that the first time he ever fired his gun in his five-year career as a police officer was the August afternoon he shot dead black teen Michael Brown . His side of the story: Wilson walked Stephanopoulus through the day of the shooting, from the moment he ordered Brown and a friend off the street to the fatal shots that killed the 18 year old . Victim: Michael Brown was shot dead by Wilson on August 9. The community of Ferguson, Missouri erupted in violence Monday night after the grand jury's decision was announced . In a segment of the interview which aired on ABC's World News on Tuesday evening, Wilson explained step by step the confrontation with Brown that culminated with the 18-year-old's death. He also said he feels no guilt and now just wants a normal life with his new wife. 'The reason I have a clear conscience is because I know I did my job right,' Wilson said. As the grand jury's decision was announced Monday night, St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch revealed that Wilson heard a call over the radio on August 9 about a robbery suspect which matched the description of Brown. Wilson told ABC that he spotted Brown and a friend walking down the center of the street, not far from the convenience store where the theft was reported. The police officer asked the two to move to the sidewalk, and says Brown refused and got violent, reaching into his police vehicle to strike him on the cheek. Wilson went on to grab Brown's forearm, and says it was then that he first realized how mighty the 6-foot-4, 292-pound 18-year-old was. 'He was a very large, a very powerful man,' Wilson recalled, adding that he himself is 'above average' at 6-foot-4 and 210 pounds. While the struggle ensued in the SUV, Wilson says Brown reached for his gun and and tried to turn the firearm on him. Flames: A local storage facility is set ablaze in Ferguson during disturbances that saw 150 live gunshots fired, according to police . Wilson fired his first shots then, but the first few pulls on the trigger failed because Brown's fingers were jamming the trigger. One shot finally got through, and that was the first bullet to hit Brown, Wilson said. The teen then backed off and started walking away, but Wilson pursued, saying it's not his job to 'sit and wait'. He radioed for backup, saying shots have been fired and then gave chase. That's when Brown turned around and started coming back towards the officer. Wilson says he also saw the teen reach towards his waistband, and feared Brown may be concealing a weapon - though he showed no indication that he had one when they were fighting seconds earlier. 'My initial thought was, is there a weapon in there?' Wilson said. As the teen started 'charging' towards him, Wilson said he feared for his life and thought: 'Can I shoot this guy,? Legally can I? And the answer was I have to, he will kill me if he gets to me.' Secret wedding: On Monday morning, it was revealed that 28-year-old Wilson (left) - who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting - quietly married his fellow officer, Barbara Spradling (right), 37, last month . The final fatal shots were fired when Brown was just eight to 10 feet away, Wilson said. It was the first time in his five years as a police officer that Wilson ever had to fire his weapon, he confessed. The officer went on to express no regret in shooting Brown, saying he wouldn't have done anything differently if he had to live the experience over again. He also said he would have acted the same if the teen were white, denying any racial profiling on his part. Now, Wilson just wants to move on with his life. It was revealed this week that he married a fellow Ferguson police officer Barbara Spradling, 37, this month in a ceremony officiated by one of his lawyers. 'We just want to have a normal life, that’s it,' Wilson said. Wilson is on paid leave while the Police Department conducts an internal review of the Brown shooting to see whether Wilson violated any policies.

"The controversy enveloping the Veterans Affairs department's health care division is actually a net positive for the country, says retired neurosurgeon and conservative commentator Ben Carson, because it has shown Americans the pitfalls of a government run healthcare system. 'I think what’s happening with the veterans is a gift from God to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider,' Carson told Fox News on Saturday after an anchor asked him if the VA drama is a 'preview' of what is going to happen with Obamacare when it is fully implemented. 'And if we can’t get it right, with the relatively small number of veterans,' Carson continued, 'how in the world with are you going to do it with the entire population? You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out.' 'I think what¿s happening with the veterans is a gift from God to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider,' Dr. Ben Carson told Fox News on Saturday after an anchor asked him if the VA drama is a 'preview' of what is going to happen with Obamacare when it is fully implemented . Dr. Carson was catapulted to prominence after his keynote at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. During his speech, Carson, who is black, expressed criticism for a wide range of Obama administration policies, including the health care reform law, to president Barack Obama's face. 'Here’s my solution: when a person is born, give them a birth certificate, an electronic medical record, and a health savings account, to which money can be contributed pre-tax to the time you’re born to the time you die,' Carson proposed. 'When you die, you can pass it on to your family members so that when you’re 85 years old and you have six diseases, you’re not trying to spend up everything. You’re happy to send it on and there’s nobody talking about death panels.' Carson's fiery profession of support for values consistent with conservatism immediately caught the attention of right-wing groups, and by the following day pundits and grassroots advocates were calling on Carson to run for president in 2016. 'If the Lord grabbed me by the collar and made me do it, I would,' Carson told Fox News host Sean Hannity the day after the breakfast. Carson is now a contributor to Fox News and conservative newspaper The Washington Times and has only grown more vocal about his opposition to Obamacare. 'You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,' he told the very conservative attendees of the Family Research Council's Values Voter Summit in October. 'And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control,' he said. Dr. Ben Carson, pictured here at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference in 2013, is a potential 2016 presidential candidate. Carson said this week he's 'starting to feel' a calling to run . On Friday, Carson laid into the VA as 'a top heavy organization with a lot of bureaucracy that keeps things from happening.' 'We simply don’t need that kind of bureaucracy in virtually anything that we’re doing today,' Carson told a CBS Philadelphia radio host. 'We’re problem solvers - or at least we used to be very innovative people. That’s being depressed by the kinds of policies that we’ve put in place now. We need to unleash the potential of the American people.' Carson, who chagrins at being labeled as a follower of any political ideology, chastised Republicans and Democrats on Saturday for playing politics with the health care of the nation's veterans. 'We need seriousness here rather than just political speak. ‘How can I look better? How can my party look better?’ Carson said. 'Let's stop, and think about the people.' 'You know, you guys are servants. You're not rulers,' he added. 'So first of all get that out of your mind, and think about what can we do with the problems we have to solve in this nation, which are substantial, some of which threaten to actually destroy or our nation - our fiscal irresponsibility. We can deal with these things.' Carson said this week he's 'starting to feel' a calling to seek office because so people have asked him 'to do something.' 'I think I’m starting to hear something,' he told The Weekly Standard. 'It’s not something I want to do after a very arduous career in neurosurgery; I was looking for some relaxation in my life,' Carson told CBS. 'I don’t know if it’s so much me that they want as they want some common sense. Preferably somebody would come along who offered all those things, who engendered a lot of excitement and then I could get behind them and push them,' he said. 'But if it doesn’t happen than certainly, I would have to consider it,' he added. Carson would be well-funded if he does decide to run. In the first three months of 2014 alone, the National Draft Ben Carson Committee raised close to $2.4 million. By comparsion, the Ready for Hillary political action committee raised significantly less money than Carson's fans did. The National Draft Ben Carson Committee has already spent all of the money it raised, but its ability to elicit so much money in donations on Carson's behalf a year and a half out from a figurative presidential campaign is impressive. Say the magic words, and Dr. Carson could go from dark horse presidential candidate to serious competitior overnight.","Ben Carson is a former neurosurgeon who is considering running for president in 2016 .

"Wife beater: Paul Gonzalez has been sentenced to 15 years in jail for the savage beating of his ex-wife . A former Marine who savagely beat his wife in front of a judge after he was ordered to pay child maintenance at a divorce hearing has received the maximum sentence of 15 years behind bars. Paul Gonzalez, 29, had to be subdued by a Taser when he flew into a rage at Catherine Scott, who suffered a broken nose, a fractured jaw, concussion and severe bruising to her face. At the sentencing on Friday, Judge Geoffrey Cohen ignored Gonzalez's apologies, branding his actions in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida hearing 'an outrage'. 'It was in a court of law where people . for hundreds of years have been coming to peaceably resolve their . disputes where people have an expectation of safety — certainly where . your former wife thought she would be safe,' Cohen said. 'You chose it . as a place to viciously assault her.' In February, Gonzalez pleaded 'no contest' to charges of beating his ex-wife in April 2011. The couple, who married in 2006, had been discussing their divorce when Gonzalez flew into a rage and ran out of the chambers. He stormed back in, screamed that he . was not going to obey orders, grabbed his 23-year-old wife by the neck . and began pummeling the side of her face with his closed fists, . according to his arrest report. He knocked her unconscious with . the first blow but continued to punch her, and bailiffs had to Taser him twice to subdue him. Scott, also a former marine, collapsed in a court clerk's arms as a pool of blood . slowly formed by the the judge's chair at his chambers. Scroll down for video . Victim: Catherine Scott, 23, was left with concussion, a broken nose, a fractured jaw and severe bruising . She was rushed to hospital, where she was . kept in intensive care overnight while doctors monitored her for brain . trauma. According to authorities, he became angry when Judge Ronald Rothschild ordered him to pay child support for their two young children, then aged one and three. 'I woke up and I didn't know where I was,' Scott said in an interview after the attack. 'I didn't know where I was. I didn't know what was going on. I had just been hit that hard.' Scott told the court she had been so badly beaten her children were scared of her. 'I couldn’t even go pick up my children . from day care because there were complaints I was frightening the other . children,' Scott said, CBS reported. In court: Gonzalez apologised to his former wife in court. A psychiatric expert for the defense said he suffers from personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and bi-polar disorder . Scene: The attack took place in a judge's chambers, pictured. Gonzalez knocked his wife out with one punch . She added that she remains 'constantly on edge' after the beating and abuse that had been going on for years. 'No matter how long Mr. Gonzalez is contained behind bars, I will never feel safe from him,' she told the court. She added: 'He advised me that he was going to take the children and that I would never see them again, and that it was his plan to make my life a living hell.' A psychiatric expert for the defense told the judge Gonzalez suffers from . personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and bi-polar . disorder. Gonzalez’s sister added that before the beating she had contemplated having her brother committed because he had threatened to kill himself. Now: Scott told the court she still lives in fear of Gonzalez, who she said abused her for years before the attack . Then: After the beating, Scott could not collect her children from school as their friends were scared of her . Gonzalez spoke to the judge to admit he had failed, and to apologise to his ex-wife. 'I can't deny that it was me April 15 who took these two hands and put them on my former wife,' he said. 'And I know she said she wouldn't accept any apology, but what can I say? I'm sorry.' He went on: 'I hurt . the woman I said I loved and I am sorry and I hope that one day she does . forgive me. I disappointed her. I was not a . good husband. I wasn’t a good best friend. 'I destroyed any chance I had of ever doing what it was that I’ve always wanted to do — and that’s be a father, have a family and a loving wife. Be a loving husband.' Ignoring the defense's plea for the minimum term of four years and three months, Judge Cohen handed Gonzalez a 15-year jail sentence and apologized to Scott. Remorse: Gonzalez's attorney said he was fearful his client would not get the help he needs in prison . He asked why a family court judge had denied her a restraining order prior to the beating and why there had not been an armed sheriff’s deputy present during the contentious divorce hearing. 'Under very emotional circumstances the fact that there was no security in place, frankly, is inexcusable,' Judge Cohen said, according to NBC. But Gonzalez's attorney said he fears his client will not get the help he needs in prison. 'He’s a young man who has some serious mental health illnesses that need to be addressed and by sentencing him to the maximum sentence surely will not help that,' said attorney Dawn Swickle. Following the attack, Scott's lawyer Michael Dunleavy told the Florida Sun-Sentinel the alleged attack was 'surreal'. He said: 'He was punching with a true vengeance. It was vicious. He was in a rage.' See below for video . Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com .","Paul Gonzalez, 29, flew into a rage in judge's chambers in April 2011 .

"Darren Wilson spoke out for the first time today, to recount how terrified he was of Michael Brown the day he shot the 18-year-old to death in a tragic incident that has sparked national outrage over racial profiling in law enforcement. But Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who was walking with the victim when the two were approached by Wilson on that fateful day in August, says it was the Ferguson, Missouri police officer who was the real fiend and that he too feared he would be shot in the heated confrontation. Johnson spoke to CNN a day after it was announced that Wilson would not face charges in the August 9 fatal shooting, saying he was 'very upset' and angry over the grand jury's decision. Scroll down for video . Dorian Johnson (right) was with Michael Brown the day the 18-year-old was shot dead by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson. He spoke out on Tuesday, saying he was 'very upset' with a grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson on any charges. Pictured above with his attorney James Williams (left) First interview: Officer Wilson (right) spoke out for the first time in an ABC interview which aired Tuesday. The 28-year-old cop told George Stephanopoulos (left) that Brown charged at him before he fired the fatal shots. That account directly contradicts Johnson's version of events, which state that Brown was trying to surrender . According to Johnson's account, Brown was killed after raising his hands in an attempt to surrender to Wilson. Wilson on the other hand told ABC in his Tuesday interview that the teen was actually charging at him and that he fired at the teen out of self defense. The grand jury appears to have disregarded Johnson's account of events in their decision not to bring up a handful of possible charges against Wilson which included first-degree murder, second-degree murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. Victims: 18-year-old Michael Brown (left) was shot dead by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Brown's death was considered similar by many to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (right), who was shot dead in the Florida apartment complex where he was living two years ago by George Zimmerman, who thought he was a burglar . 'I know exactly what I saw. I was there the whole time and I definitely saw my friend stop and put his hands up, being compliant after being fired upon. 'He had already shot my friend so there was no way I thought that [Brown] would even believe in himself that he could take on a police officer while he himself was unarmed,' Johnson said. 'I was in fear for my life. Like I said, Darren Wilson never separated the two of us, he never said ""Dorian Johnson I'm not shooting at you, I'm not chasing you"" so at the time I thought he was after both of us. I feared for my life,' Johnson added. Expected: Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton (pictured) says she was not surprised by the grand jury's decision, but maintained hope that the cop would face consequences for killing an unarmed teenager . Johnson is joined in frustration by Sybrina Fulton, the mother of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, whose death two years ago sparked similar fury from civil rights activists when shooter George Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury in the slaying. Fulton also spoke on CNN to accuse Officer Wilson of murder, while admitting she wasn't surprised by the grand jury's decision after witnessing how her own son's case was handled. 'Judging by history, I wasn't surprised but there was a certain part of me that just wanted him to be held accountable for the death of a young man,' she said. Fulton also isn't surprised by Officer Wilson's account of events, saying he is just trying to save himself from receiving any consequence in the teen's death. 'You have to remember that it was a murder that was committed here and what did we expect him to say? We're not going to expect him to say things that's [sic] going to convict himself and so he's going to say whatever he needs to say in order to get out of this situation,' Fulton said. 'He's going to say that he felt threatened...The unfortunate thing is that nobody knows for sure what happened but the officer and Michael Brown. And just as in Trayvon Martin's case, Michael Brown isn't here to tell his side of the story.'","Dorian Johnson maintains that his friend Michael Brown was holding his hands up in surrender the moment he was shot dead by cop Darren Wilson .
Wilson, however, has said that Brown was charging at him when he fired the fatal shots on August 9 .

'We're guna have to get the exact size to give to people, have it measured,' he said. As for whether they are going to dry clean it before they let anyone wear it? 'We might leave it up to the first person that wears it,' he said. As for the rules of wearing the suit and how much people have to donate to be able to don the blue jacket and pants, it's wide open. 'Leaving it open to rules of wearing the suit, keen to see what people will donate, hopefully decent bids.' 'I think will get a lot of people, even wedding guests who would be willing to wear a good novelty suit, I've inspected it and it’s a nice suit.' Stefanovic's experiment sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post . Mr Gull said they only starting bidding towards the end of the auction and the price jumped significantly but they were able to end up winners after quite a few bids. He'll be flying back to Hamilton island on Thursday and says he plans to document the suits travels on social media. As for whether there's plans of maybe a shrine, to showcase the suit, possibly! 'Might have to put it in a safe,' he said. After Stefanovic revealed his everyday workwear, he said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the past year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked. Stefanovic (pictured with Richard Wilkins (left) and Ben Fordham (right) said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the past year, now his 'infamous' blue suit is up for sale on Ebay . He said no one had even noticed his choice of attire while women got the brunt of everything from the colour they wore to thousands of tweets about something wrong they said. 'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test),' Stefanovic told Fairfax Media. Stefanovic's  experiment also sparked a media frenzy worldwide with interest coming from websites like the BBC and New York Post. Feminist website Jezabel were among those to weigh in on the experiment.

"A man has been jailed for nine years after he repeatedly punched an African migrant to the ground in a violent robbery in a train station alleyway, last October. Timothy Williams, from Illawarra, NSW, can be seen hitting the refugee so hard in his face that he required stitches in his left ear and lost a tooth, in CCTV footage shown in court on Thursday morning. While his victim was on the floor, the 26-year-old continuously bashed the man as he tried to escape the unprovoked assault. The refugee had only been in Australia for five days after travelling from his native Eritrea - one of the most violent countries in the world - when he was set upon at Wollongong railway station, 82 kilometres south of Sydney. Scroll down for video . Smack: The moment Timothy Williams first punched the African refugee last October at Wollongong railway station, NSW . His attackers saw their victim approach the pedestrian ramp while on the railway overpass on Crown Street and stopped to wait for him. Mr Williams then signalled for the man to come over to him, demanding his cash. However, the refugee speaks little English and did not understand the demands. Mr Williams grabbed money from his backpack, prompting the victim to hand over a few coins from his pocket. His blonde friend Jaimee Lee Haynes, 28, hangs around in the background, reportedly acting as a lookout - unaware that the whole scene was being filmed on CCTV anyway. During the mugging video, she strolls about in front of them in purple shorts before scarpering for a short period while Mr Williams suddenly bashes the refugee to the ground. As the onslaught continues, the man can be seen begging for mercy as he is thrown about the alley by Mr Williams. Trickery: Mr Williams appears to chat with the man as he goes through his bag, while his blonde friend Jaimee Lee Haynes, 28, hangs around in the background as a lookout . Surprising: At the beginning of the CCTV video it appears that the two men are just chatting like friends but Mr Williams is actually demanding his victim's cash . A passer by sees the incident but fails to stop. When he is eventually free of his attacker's clutches, he attempts to run away but falls to the floor before reaching the end of the pathway. Mr Williams' friend Ms Haynes then reappears in the video and the pair begin calmly collecting the victim's belongings from the floor. The muggers got away with the man's necklace, bracelet, sunglasses, headphones and $60 in cash. As the victim looks back one last time, Mr Williams appears to shout something at him before strolling off. Floored: The Illawarra man sets upon his victim without hesitation . Deceptive: It may look like Mr Williams is bending down to help the man on the floor but he is actually just moving him so he can hit him again . Towering over him: The refugee cowers as he is violently assaulted (left) and grabbed by the neck (right) Slammed: The victim is thrown once again onto the floor (left) and appears to beg for mercy (right) Judge Paul Conlon said the shocking CCTV footage was a reliable account of what happened during the violent assault. 'A viewing of this footage is all that is needed to make an accurate assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence,' he said, the Illawarra Mercury reported. The Judge confirmed that the pair were waiting for their victim to reach the train station's pedestrian walkway. 'When the victim was stopped, it was also clear that there was a plan of action,' he said. Getaway: Mr Williams eventually lets his victim run away from him . Strolling: The attacker calmly walks back to pick up the bag and the refugee's possessions from the floor and Ms Haynes rejoins him . He also revealed how Mr Williams attempted to downplay the attack while speaking to a court-appointed psychologist. 'He provides [the doctor] with a palpably false version of his confrontation and vicious assault on an unsuspecting victim,' Judge Conlon said. Mr Williams will be locked up for six years, back-dated to when he first came into custody at the time of the offence, and won't be eligible for parole in 2019. Meanwhile, the woman seen with him in the video - Ms Haynes - will be sentenced on Friday. The victim was a refugee from Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa that is bordered by Sudan to the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east. The man had only been in Australia - supposedly a safe nation - for five weeks when he was violently set upon. His home country, which has a poor human rights record, is now in a fragile state of peace after more than 30 years of fighting. However, thousands are now fleeing due to a forced labour program that is spawning human rights violations, according to a report last month that will be debated next month at the U.N. Human Rights Council. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR estimates that 2,000 people of Eritrea's 6 million population are fleeing every month. Their relatives are forced to pay fines of 50,000 nafka (about $3,607) for each family member who has left. Most families can't afford the fine so a family member may be detained until the money is paid, or business licenses or property may be confiscated, the report said. The government began its program of national service, where people are put to work in reforestation, soil and water conservation and reconstruction, in 1995 but it has turned into an indefinite conscription, the report said. Eritrea emerged from its long war of independence in 1993 only to plunge once again into military conflict, first with Yemen and then with its old adversary, Ethiopia. The country is ruled by President Isaias Afewerki, who has been in office since independence in 1993. National elections have been scheduled and cancelled - they have ever been held since the country became independent. People who practice 'unregistered' religions, try to flee the nation, or escape military duty are arrested and put into prison. The religions that are allowed in the country are the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Eritrean Lutheran Church, and Sunnite Islam. All other religions are persecuted and freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of Eritreans flee the country. Meanwhile, a 2011 UN report estimated that about 70 per cent of Eritreans cannot meet their food needs on their own. But the government insists Eritrea is self-sufficient in food and declines international food aid. Domestic and international human rights organisations are also not allowed to function in Eritrea. Eritrea is a country in the Horn of Africa that is bordered by Sudan to the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east .

"HeloÌsa Pinheiro is the 'Girl From Ipanema', a Rio native whose daily strolls past the Veloso Bar in 1962 inspired a global hit and put Brazil on the map.

"A teenager at one of the country's most prestigious private schools has outed himself as a virgin and is encouraging his classmates to employ the same restraint to avoid getting their hearts broken. Phin Lyman, 18, a sixth former at Wellington College, Berkshire, wrote an article in his school magazine warning peers that 'casual sex never works in the long term'. Mr Lyman - a pupil at the £30,000-per year school which counts author Sebastian Faulks and broadcaster Peter Snow among its alumni - described sex as 'the glue' which connects two people 'physically and emotionally'. Phin Lyman, 18,  wrote an . article in the school magazine at Wellington College, Berkshire, outing himself as a virgin and . encouraging other students to refrain from having 'casual sex' But he said boys often learned about sex through pornography and thought it was 'just for them' - which would invariably leave girls, who consider sex to be romantic, disappointed. According to The Times, Mr Lyman wrote: 'I believe that sex is an incredibly strong symbol of love between two people. Think of it as glue. Once you have sex with someone, you're connected to them emotionally and physically. 'If you tear that bond the rip leaves open scars where the glue once was. That's why 'casual sex' never works in the long term, it just doesn't.' Mr Lyman, who has written the story for The Wellingtonian, the school's magazine, said he had decided to 'go public' with his virginity because he thought the pressure on younger pupils to have sex was 'depressing'. He believes 90 per cent of people are drunk when they lose their virginity which 'upsets' him. He also said most of his friends at the co-educational private school, which was set up in 1859, knew he was a virgin but not many understood the reasons why - which led him to write the article. Mr Lyman said his classmates at Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berkshire - which costs around £30,000 a . year to attend - know he is a virgin but do not understand the reasons why . The student also wrote that he had been surprised at the attitude of boys towards girls in their age group. But he admitted himself that his plan could take 'a lot of self-discipline'. Mr Lyman said there were 'incredibly good-looking girls' at the school and there had been times when he had been forced to 'take a step back'. The . pupil's comment comes just days after it emerged nearly one in ten . students at British universities admit they first had sex at the age of . 14 or younger. The private boarding and day school college counts broadcaster Peter Snow, pictured left, and author Sebastian Faulks, pictured right, among its alumni . The shocking survey of more than 6,000 students at 100 universities, carried out by Student Beans, found nine per cent of students admitted they lost their virginity before they reached their 15th birthday, with two per cent saying they had sex before they turned 14. By the time they reached 16 - the legal age of consent - that figure had risen to almost one in four. Latest figures from the NHS published in 2011 show the number of young people having sex has dropped. According to the findings, 27 per cent of men aged between 15 and 24 had not had sex. This compared to 22 per cent in 2001. Government figures also show young people who admitted drinking alcohol in the previous week had also dropped by one quarter in nine years. The statistics show 12% of school pupils had drunk alcohol in the last week, compared with 26% in 2001. One year earlier in 2010, 13% of pupils reported drinking in the last week. The survey also found that more than half have had unprotected sex while 61 per cent used camera phones to send explicit . pictures or videos of themselves to partners, known as 'sexting'. After starting university, more than half admitted to having one-night stands and six per cent said they had already had more than 20 partners. Just eight per cent said they were still virgins. Norman Wells from the Family Education Trust, which promotes traditional moral values, said: 'The survey underlines the failure of contraceptive-based sex education to prepare young people for lifelong marriages. 'Contrary to the claims of those who assert that marriage is an outdated institution, the overwhelming majority of students expect to get married, with only six per cent saying they do not wish to marry. 'Yet the casual attitudes towards sex suggested by high levels of one night stands and multiple sexual partners indicate that students are ignorant of the character qualities they will need.' Meanwhile, the latest figures from the NHS published in 2011 show 27 per cent of men aged between 15 and 24 had not had sex, compared with 22 per cent in 2001. Those who admitted drinking alcohol in the previous week had also dropped by a quarter in that same ten-year period. Of those aged 11 to 15, one in eight said they had drunk the week before, according to the 2011 NHS figures. The college, set on 400 acres of land, counts the broadcaster Peter . Snow, the comedian and impressionist Rory Bremner, the singer Will . Young and the journalist and author Sebastian Faulks among its alumni. The . school was founded in the affluent village of Crowthorne - also know . for housing maximum-security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor - in 1859. It was opened in honour of the Duke of Wellington, who led British forces in several large-scale military victories, to educate sons of British Army soldiers.","Phin Lyman, 18, revealed he is a virgin in an article for school magazine .

"That's how you know you've made it. Hobbit star Martin Freeman arrived in Auckland, New Zealand today in true movie-star style ahead of the film's premiere, in a jet emblazoned with his own face. A longstanding favourite in the UK, the former 'The Office' star is poised for international fame upon the release of the new instalment of the Lord of The Rings franchise, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.' This leap from household name to Hollywood stardom is marked by Air New Zealand's decision to paint the faces of Freeman and his co-stars across the side of a Boeing 777 jet. The Hobbit graphic is the largest of its kind to be placed on the exterior of a jet . The plane was on show to the public at LAX in in Los Angeles before escorting stars to the premiere .

The face of New Zealand: Martin Freeman arrives in Auckland ahead the The Hobbit's premiere in Wellington this week . Freeman and co-star Richard Armitage flew in from Los Angeles for the premiere . Air New Zealand and the country as a whole seem to have taken Hampshire born Freeman to their hearts. The airline is reported to have spend the larger percentage of its £51 million pound marketing budget for the coming two years on Hobbit-inspired advertising. The giant movie graphic is the largest ever image of its kind to be put on the side of a plane. Air New Zealand flight crew pose with Hobbit-themed eye masks and flight socks as part of the airline's promotion . The new film, the first of a three part epic prequel to the billion dollar franchise. Director Peter Jackson's latest outing from middle earth is set to be a huge revenue spinner at the box office alone. His previous Tolkien adaptations grossed a total of $6billion in movie tickets and DVD sales, and earned 17 Oscars from all three films. Filmmakers hope this new surge in marketing activity will restore goodwill to a movie beset with controversy in recent weeks. Just last week the estate of J R. R. Tolkien filed a suit again the film's producers over accusations of exploitative merchandising. The estate of Tolkien is upset at what it calls 'morally questionable' digital marketing including an online slot machine, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. The Tolkien estate is seeking $80million from Warner Bros., its New Line subsidiary and rights holder Saul Zaentz Co. Tolkien's family contends a merchandizing agreement extends only to tangible products such as figurines and clothing and not to electronic rights. Warner Bros. declined to comment on the claims. The producers of 'The Hobbit' have came under fire in the last two weeks from wranglers after 27 animals used on set during the filming of the trilogy have died. While no animals were harmed during the actual filming, wranglers claim the production company is still responsible for the deaths because the animals were kept at a nearby farm filled with bluffs, sinkholes and other 'death traps.' Four wranglers working with the animals claim they repeatedly raised concerns about the farm peppered with bluffs, sinkholes and broken-down fencing with their superiors and the production company, owned by Warner Bros., but it continued to be used. Peter Jackson, the film's director, is said to be 'mortified' after a journalist was banned by the production company from reporting on the film's premiere. Radio New Zealand reporter Cushla Norman had her passes revoked after writing negative stories about the the movie. Mr Jackson had her credentials reinstated.

"Elizabeth Starr fears her now illegal  boob job will kill her after her breasts ballooned to an O cup . An adult film star fears her banned breast implants will kill her after her breasts ballooned to an O cup. Elizabeth Starr had now-illegal 'string' implants 15 years ago to boost her career - but says her life has been ruined by her super-sized chest. Doctors have recommended she face a double mastectomy rather than live with her potentially fatal implants. But the mother-of-two, who has endured a staggering 63 corrective procedures, says she can't face more surgery despite being at risk from blood clots and infection as it would mean the end of her career. The  43-year-old glamour model whose breasts are still growing, said: 'I was basically the victim of an experiment and I've been paying the price for it ever since. 'Back then I had a family to support and I knew getting bigger boobs would boost my career prospects. 'Now I live day to day worrying I might be struck down by infections or blood clots - it's ruined my life.' Ms Starr, from Los Angeles, California, was already a 32F when she opted for the polypropylene string implants in 1999. The £3,000 procedure involved inserting synthetic string into the breasts to stimulate fluid production and growth. But just a few days after the operation she began suffering complications. Ms Starr, said: 'My right breast was bright red and swollen and I felt weak and shaky. 'The surgeon cut some tissue away from the breast which he thought might be infected. 'But the infection gradually ate a hole in my right breast the size of a 10-pence piece. 'The pain was unbearable.' Elizabeth had the string implant removed from her right breast, however, the left one was already too embedded to be taken out. She said: 'The way the implants work is they continue to grow inside you and become enmeshed in the breast tissue. 'Even now I have some residual string in my right breast - I don't think I'll ever be free of it all. 'I was lied to and told the operation had been approved by the medical authority, but it hadn't.' Scroll down for video . Ms Starr was already a 32F when she opted for the polypropylene string implants in 1999 . Over the next 14 years Elizabeth spent a staggering £200,000 on reconstructive operations to put right damage from the surgery. She said: 'Over the years I've had lots of implants put in and taken out to make my right breast the same size as my left. 'The tissue in my right breast was so badly damaged that there was almost nothing left. 'One operation involved taking a muscle from my back to replace damaged tissue in my right breast. 'I've spent time recovering in oxygen tents and almost died three times.' Now Elizabeth has a saline implant containing four litres of liquid in her right breast, to match the breast fluid in her left. The £3,000 procedure involved inserting synthetic string into the breasts to stimulate fluid production and growth . But the risk of further complications casts a shadow over her future health. She said: 'There is so much scar tissue in my breasts it's affecting the blood flow to the body and could cause a fatal blood clot. 'I'm a ticking time bomb because anything could happen to me - I'm so scared.' Elizabeth already had 38F breast before opting for the string implants. And the single mother to Jason, 23, and Nicholas, 20, hopes her story will act as a warning to women wanting to copy her look. She said: 'If you are going to attempt to try to become as busty as I am you are putting yourself at extreme risk. 'You have to know what you are getting yourself into because it will change your life forever. Elizabeth has a saline implant containing four litres of liquid in her right breast, to match the breast fluid in her left . Before the operation: The remaining string implant is causing fluid to leak into both breasts making them to balloon . 'I'm in constant pain - bending down and getting dressed are difficult because my back hurts from the weight of my breasts.' She says the remaining string implant is causing fluid to leak into both breasts making them to balloon. For the last eight years she has been cared for by Dr Alexander Sinclair, an expert in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Dr Sinclair said: 'Over the years I've seen cases of polypropylene string implants but I've never seen a case quite like Elizabeth's - her future is uncertain. 'I presented her case at the local medical society and the sentiment was she needed a double mastectomy.' However, the years of operations have decimated Elizabeth's breast tissue, and she is unwilling to face more risky surgery. She said: 'I have one option other than to live like this and that is to face a mastectomy. 'But after 63 procedures on my right breast and fighting to keep my career and my breast, I honestly don't think that I could. 'A mastectomy would take away my livelihood and I don't know what else I would do.' 'It's hard when you have been a victim of something and it's even harder when you choose a path in life where people might look down on you and think, 'she deserved it'. 'But I wouldn't wish this on anyone and I hope my story will act as a warning.'","Elizabeth Starr had now-illegal 'string' implants 15 years ago .

"Reports of breast implants bursting in Britain have risen more than fivefold in three years, it was revealed today. More than 1,500 cases of ruptured implants were reported in 2012/2013, compared to just 293 in 2009/2010 - with one expert putting the problem partly down to the ‘Jordan syndrome’. Plastic surgeon Douglas McGeorge said many women are insisting on outsize breasts to copy glamour model Katie Price, who became known for her surgically-enhanced chest. Jordan: One plastic surgeon said many women are insisting on outsize breasts to copy glamour model Katie Price, who became known for her surgically-enhanced chest. She is pictured left in 2005 and right in 2011 . Model: Jordan (left in 2004, and right in 2008) had her first breast implants aged just 18 when she went from a 32B to a 32D - and has since gone on to spend thousands on her cleavage in a total of six operations . Mr McGeorge, former president of the British Association for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, told The Sun: ‘There is ""Jordan syndrome"" where some women want bigger and bigger breasts. ‘The bigger they are, the more problems that are likely to occur. Large implants are influenced by gravity. Just as a bag containing a goldfish ripples when you lift it, large implants can ripple.’ Speaking to journalists Nick McDermott and Christina Earle, Mr McGeorge also told of 'problems in recent years where some cheaper implants were not up to standard and were prone to failure’. Problems reported in the past few years follow revelations that French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses. Almost 50,000 women in the UK, and some 400,000 worldwide, were affected by the scandal - which came to light after doctors found unexpectedly high numbers of implants were rupturing. Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of Poly Implant Prothese, was jailed for four years last year for fraud. Changes: Katie Price's fourth breast implant operation in Los Angeles took her to 32GG, which led to her decision in 2007, after meeting first husband Peter Andre (pictured together), to have a breast reduction . Expert: Plastic surgeon Douglas McGeorge (above) put the problem of an increased number of breast implants bursting in part down to the 'Jordan syndrome' The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency received 2,427 reports of problems with fake breasts in 2012 and 2013, with 1,543 of these relating to ruptures. The Department of Health executive agency said some 30,000 breast implant operations are carried out each year and ‘the vast majority of women do not experience any problems’. Miss Price had her first breast implants aged just 18 when she went from a 32B to a 32D - and has since gone on to spend thousands on her cleavage in a total of six operations. Her fourth operation in Los Angeles took her to 32GG, which led to her decision in 2007, after meeting first husband Peter Andre, to have a breast reduction. She hoped to reduce her bust from a 32G to 32C, but was left with a 32F cup and was unhappy with the results, which she felt she left her breasts too far apart. She then underwent further surgery to rectify it. In total, Miss Price has spent more than £100,000 on plastic surgery.","1,543 cases of ruptured implants in 2012/2013, up from 293 in 2009/2010 .

"The breast implants at the centre of a health scare involving thousands of British women contained a ‘near criminal’ mix of chemicals including a fuel additive, it emerged today. Scientists in France carried out an extensive examination of the ‘secret formula’ used by Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), which went into liquidation last year. Up to 50,000 women in the UK, including breast cancer survivors, have the implants, which until now were thought to be filled with gel meant for mattresses. Jean-Claude Mas pictured with one of the implants. He is how facing manslaughter charges in France. Mas denies any wrong-doing claiming that his implants were all completely safe . Defective: A plastic surgeon holds breast implants which were removed from a patient when they ruptured . Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has ordered an urgent review of the safety of the PIP implants and has promised that if there are concerns the Government will 'act with whatever remedy required' In fact, chemists commissioned by RTL, the Paris radio station, found a range of potentially hugely harmful components including Baysilone, Silopren and Rhodorsil. Baysilone is used as a fuel additive, while Silopren and Rhodorsil are mainly used in the production of rubber tubing. ‘On the menu, a mixture of products used by industrial companies that have never been clinically tested for their possible harmful effects on the body,’ said a spokesman for RTL, adding: ‘They include a fuel additive’. The spokesman said that Jean-Claude Mas, the 72-year-old founder of PIP who is facing manslaughter charges in France, put all the chemicals together as a part of a ‘secret formula’. It enabled him to sell the implants at a vast discount, so enabling him to become a multi-millionaire. ‘When the chemicals were all mixed with each other, the illusion was complete,’ said the RTL spokesman. ‘All are products unknown to the medical world,’ said toxicologist Andre Picot, who carried out research for RTL, adding the mix was ‘on the verge of criminal’. Philippe Courtois, a lawyer acting for women caught up in the scandal in France, said: ‘We could not believe that the gel could contain a fuel additive.’ Mr Courtois said health authorities across the world, including the NHS, should have ordered a detailed analysis of the gel as soon as women started to complain of feeling ill because of them. Figures show that PIP implants have an 8 per cent chance of rupture – eight times higher than claimed over the last fortnight by the UK’s medical safety watchdog. Some victims say private clinics are demanding up to £3,000 to remove the implants. The clinics argue that they bought the implants in good faith and would face financial ruin if they had to remove them free of charge. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has ordered an urgent review of the safety of the PIP implants and has promised that if there are concerns the Government will ‘act with whatever remedy required’. He hopes to publish the review’s findings within days, and industry experts expect him to follow France in advising all women with PIP implants to have them taken out. With each operation costing up to £3,000, the total sum involved could reach £150million. Leaks of silicone from the implants can cause agonising pain, as well as swelling and lumps in the breast and armpit, some of which can be easily mistaken by women for tumours, causing unnecessary anxiety. There are also fears that the PIP implants, which were among the cheapest on the market, raise the risk of cancer. Mas denies any wrong-doing, claiming that his implants were all completely safe.","Analysis of 'secret formula' created by multi-millionaire Jean-Claude Mas, 72, found fuel additive and chemicals used in rubber tubing .

As a result, she says she was better off when she was overweight - as at least she had . her large stomach to rest her boobs on, and take the weight off her . back. The mother-of-two said she now has no body confidence with her size 10 figure and 36L chest. She said: 'I have no confidence. I don't like showing myself to anyone and I refuse to undress in front of my husband. 'I should be super confident and proud of my new slim body, but instead I feel horrible.

But . the mother says she struggles most with the abuse she receives from . strangers in the street, who shout comments such as, 'you wouldn't need an anchor to make . you sink'. She said she feels 'let-down' by the NHS who refuse to help her. The . full-time mother said: 'The doctor said I had to help myself first, . which I have done. So why won't they give me a breast reduction? I feel really let down by the NHS because I stuck to my side of the bargain. 'I . have saved the tax payer thousands by losing weight through dieting and . not asking for a gastric band. I'm not asking the NHS for this . operation for cosmetic reasons. My breasts are ruining my life.' Marie has suffered with large breasts since she was a schoolgirl. She was a DD before her school friends even started wearing bras then shot up to a 44M when she became obese. Her weight increased when she started comfort eating. She would consume a burger or sausage with chips every day and  regularly ordered takeaway pizzas with a kebab on top. After years of debilitating back pain and reduced mobility, Marie approached medics about a breast reduction in 2011. They . told her under strict NHS guidelines she would only be entitled to the . £7,000 procedure if she lost a considerable amount of weight first. Marie . drafted in the support of her overweight husband and two daughters. By . cutting out the unhealthy foods that had been their staple diet, between . the four of them they shed more than 30 stone. Disappointment: When she went back to doctors they told her she didn't qualify for a breast reduction because her case wasn't extreme enough .

She said she still looks obese despite her hard efforts to lose weight and has to buy specially-made £40 bras. Her large breasts have forced her confidence to plummet so much, she is registered depressed with her GP. She also suffers from severe angina and relies on taking strong pain . killers, Co-codamol, four times a day to manage her back and neck pain. And a private consultant Marie saw warned her mammograms are unlikely to pick . up cancerous lumps in her breasts as they are too large for the scans . to be accurate.

NHS West Sussex spokesman said: 'CCG policy, and that of its . predecessor body the primary care trust, is clear that breast reduction . surgery is not a procedure routinely available on the NHS. 'If . a patient feels they need this treatment, their clinician would have to . make an application to a specialist panel for individual funding . demonstrating that there are exceptional clinical circumstances why the . patient should receive the treatment outside of the policy.

"Denied help: Bernadette Cini was infected with a flesh eating bug following a breast operation . When Bernadette Cini decided to have a breast reduction after years of deliberation, she opted for a surgeon at the Harley Medical Group –  a prestigious, reputable firm. Or so she thought. Her G-cup breasts caused significant back pain and she may have qualified for NHS treatment but chose to go private for this highly complex operation. ‘I wanted the best possible result,’ says the 62-year-old. ‘The surgeon Hicham Mouallem assured me he used a technique that minimised scarring and retained sensitivity to the nipples, which could be lost. So I decided to go ahead.’ It was a decision she would bitterly regret. In the days after her £5,700 surgery in 2006, the mother of two from Croydon, Surrey, developed a rampant infection in her breasts. It was ‘flesh-eating’ necrosis, caused by pseudomonas, bacteria normally found in soil. Over the course of a year, she had five operations to cut away diseased tissue and repair her breasts. The constant agony she was in meant Bernadette was unable to go on working as a nanny and eventually had to give up her job completely. ‘Everything became a horrible blur of hospitals, operations and pain,’ she recalls. But when Bernadette sought compensation, Harley Medical Group claimed they were only ‘agents’ so not responsible, and that the surgeon had returned to Italy. Mouallem was a ‘Fifo’ – a ‘fly in, fly out’ foreign surgeon – and had no insurance in the UK. Although all doctors treating patients in Britain must be registered by law with the GMC, they do not have to have insurance in this country. There are no official figures on the number of Fifos operating in the UK, but the last estimate, from a report by the then Healthcare Commission in 2005, stated that two-thirds of surgeons may be from abroad. If they are uninsured, patients who suffer horrific complications struggle to obtain compensation. It took Bernadette months to track down Mouallem and two years to build a case against him. He admitted he had not warned Bernadette of her heightened risk of infection, due to her weight, and agreed to pay her £20,000 in an out-of-court settlement, barely enough to cover her lost earnings. Recalling the initial operation at the . Highgate Hospital, Bernadette says she first noticed something was not . quite right when she woke up after surgery. A drain inserted into her . newly-reduced left  breast to remove excess fluid was not working. High risk: Ms Cini's surgeon was a 'fly-in, fly-out' foreign surgeon, who was allowed to practice in the UK but under law is not required to have insurance in Britain . Mouallem checked Bernadette that evening. She recalls: ‘He just squeezed the suction bag adding, “It’s OK,” and then left. ‘The next day when he returned and saw the drain was still not working he squeezed my breast with his hand, until fluid seemed to move into the drain.’ The next day, a different doctor discharged Bernadette and she went home. She continues: ‘At first I put my discomfort down to the fact I’d had surgery. Two days later, though, my breast was feeling really tight and painful. I returned to the clinic, where I already had an appointment for a routine dressing change. By the time I went in, my breast felt like it was going to burst and was clearly very infected. ‘The nurse told us she had never seen anything like it before and that I needed to see the surgeon. ‘When he saw it, he started to try to syringe it while pushing down on the breast with the other hand. I was in agony. ‘He didn’t have gloves on and kept telling the nurse “get her to turn away” and “keep her quiet”, because I was screaming.’ A new dressing was applied and she was sent home. A couple of days later she was again in pain and feeling extremely weak. When her partner contacted the clinic, Bernadette was amazed to discover Mouallem was no longer in the UK. She was sent to see another Harley Medical Group surgeon, who delivered the devastating news that she had a severe infection and arranged for re-admission to the Highgate. Bernadette was given antibiotics but the bug spread into the other breast. ‘It was horrifying. There was so much discharge that it would weep through a new dressing and eventually I had to re-do the dressing myself.’ For the next six weeks she was in and out of the hospital but nothing stopped the infection. It was only after she demanded a meeting with the hospital director that she was referred to another specialist, Charles Nduka. ‘He was brilliant, but he had to cut a huge amount of tissue out in order to stop the infection. I’m lucky that I still look relatively normal, with a small scar underneath both breasts. ‘I had hoped that having a breast reduction would allow me to start doing more exercise and get slim. But being so ill and immobile led me to put on weight. Mouallem treated me like something on a conveyor belt.’ Mouallem, who now claims to have UK insurance, said earlier this year: ‘She was a fat lady. She had an infection, it was from the hospital, not from me. The blame gets put on me because it is easier for the company. It wasn’t like she was dying, it was an infection. It can happen with any surgery.’","Bernadette Cini, 62, had reduction surgery with  Harley Medical Group .

"A doctor who was suspended for arranging a boob job that went horribly wrong has been allowed to return work. Dr Ashish Dutta was suspended in 2012 after Andrea Scott was left with scarring and burst stitching following her breast augmentation at the Aesthetic Beauty Centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Ms Scott, from County Durham, paid thousands of pounds to even up the size of her breasts after a tummy tuck and gastric bypass left them uneven. Dr Dutta did not perform . the surgery, but arranged the operation and advised Ms Scott despite . being subject to a six-month suspension at the time. Dr Ashish Dutta was suspended after Andrea Scott was left with scarring and burst stitching following a breast augmentation he arranged. He is now allowed to return to work if he complies with a range of conditions . Dr Dutta appealed the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service decision, but it was upheld ‘in its entirety’ after a hearing at the High Court in Manchester in February last year. A panel had branded Dr Dutta a ‘risk to patient safety’ and found him guilty of ‘serious professional misconduct’ at a hearing in September 2012. Dr Dutta told a review hearing this week he learned a ‘bitter lesson’ from the experience and promised not to repeat his behaviour. The panel, chaired by Dr Linda Buchanan, ruled it was safe to allow him back to work, but only under a string of ten conditions, which will keep him closely monitored by the GMC. ‘The panel is satisfied that you have demonstrated sufficient insight into, and awareness of, your past misconduct. It is also satisfied that you are highly unlikely to repeat your past behaviour,’ said Dr Buchanan. ‘The panel considers that a further period of suspension would be disproportionate given the progress you have made in your remediation and that conditional registration would safeguard patient safety whilst allowing you to return to practice.’ Ms Scott had the procedure to even up the size of her breasts after a tummy tuck and gastric bypass left them uneven . The conditions, which will apply for two years, require Dr Dutta to inform the GMC of any medical posts he takes and if he is made subject to any disciplinary proceedings. His work, including all cosmetic procedures, must be supervised by a consultant and he cannot carry out breast augmentation unless he is directly supervised by a breast surgeon. The conditions will come into force in 28 days, subject to appeal, but Dr Dutta will remain suspended during that period. He will have to attend another review hearing towards the end of the period of conditional registration before he can return to unrestricted practice. The surgeon who carried out the operation to even out the size of Ms Scott’s breasts is also currently facing General Medical Council allegations of misconduct over her treatment. Mohammad Azhar Aslam inserted the 800cc implants, which were ‘too big and heavy’ and were likely to cause problems because ‘gravity only works one way’. Mr Aslam faces a series of charges relating to deficiencies in his treatment of four women between 2004 and 2010. He denies any of the procedures were inappropriate or any of the care inadequate, but has admitted two allegations relating to poor record keeping. After the operation in early 2010, Ms Scott said that the stitches on her left breast burst open and her implant started to sag from the wound. She told the panel at Mr Aslam’s hearing she had first noticed wetness around the stitching area underneath her left breast at the end of February 2010. ‘Within two weeks it had gone from a tiny whole to the size of a 20 pence whole to the size of a 50 pence whole, to then having a blister,’ she added. Ms Scott said she had received ‘absolutely atrocious’ aftercare and had needed four separate operations to correct the problem. For two years Dr Dutta will not be allowed to carry out any procedures without the supervision of a consultant and he will not be allowed to perform breast surgery without the presence of a breast surgeon. Image shows Ms Scott's breasts after the botched op . She says she has also been left £45,000 out of pocket and that she has psychological scars from the experience. Ms Scott said: 'I just went to the surgery to get it fixed. But it's affected my business and my relationship. I've struggled to come to terms with it, I've seen a psychiatrist and they've said I have an adjustment disorder. 'I don't want to think about it, but one of the worst side effects of the condition is suicide. This whole thing has totally taken over my life. 'I've had two years of not going anywhere, and my business has totally failed because I couldn't go to work. 'Before I had it done I would get out of the shower and it wouldn't be a problem.

"Planet Earth is set to have a very close encounter with an asteroid the day after Valentine's Day. The asteroid - which goes by the catchy name of 2012 DA14 - will miss our home planet by just 17,200 miles, which is a very near miss in space terms. The asteroid, which is about 150ft across, will come closer to Earth than the ring of geosynchronous satellites, which are in orbit about 22,200 miles above the Earth. Space rock: Although it will come uncomfortably close to the Earth, the asteroid will only be visible if you have a good pair of binoculars . On June 30 1908, in a remote part of Russia, a fireball was seen streaking across the daytime sky. This event – now known as the Tunguska . event – is believed to have been caused by an incoming meteor which . exploded in the atmosphere. Evenks natives and Russian settlers in the hills north-west of Lake Baikal reported a column of bluish light, nearly as bright as the sun, moving across the sky. About 10 minutes later, there was a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported the sound source moving east to north. The sounds were accompanied by a shockwave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of miles away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors rather than the sighting of the explosion. The explosion registered on seismic stations across Eurasia. In some places the shock wave would have been equivalent to an earthquake of 5.0 on the Richter scale. It also produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in the UK. Over the next few days, night skies in Asia and Europe were aglow - and all of this came from a meteorite exploding some four to six miles above the Earth's surface. Says Don Yeomans, manager of the Near-Earth Object Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory: 'The generally agreed upon theory is that on the morning of June 30, 1908, a large space rock, about 120 feet across, entered the atmosphere of Siberia and then detonated in the sky.' Although the asteroid is small, if it . were on a collision course with Earth, it would produce the equivalent . of 2.5 megatons of TNT. And this is just one of some 500,000 rocks circling the Earth. The good news is that scientists say that that . isn't enough to wipe out life on the planet - but it could wipe out a . city the size of Greater London. However, a miss is as good as a mile, and unless you're specifically looking for it, you almost certainly won't see the asteroid. NASA says that it won't be bright enough to see with the naked eye, but that a good pair of binoculars or a telescope should be able to pick it out. On the 15th, said NASA, the asteroid will travel rapidly from the southern evening sky into the northern morning sky, with its closest Earth approach occurring about 19:26 UTC when it will achieve a magnitude of less than seven, which is somewhat fainter than naked eye visibility. About four minutes after its Earth close approach, there is a good chance it will pass into the Earth's shadow for about 18 minutes or so before reappearing from the eclipse. When travelling rapidly into the northern morning sky, 2012 DA14 will quickly fade in brightness. The best view for astronomers will be from Indonesia, says NASA, while stargazers in Eastern Europe, Asia and Australia should also be able to get a good look at the space rock as it whizzes past us at a speed of 17,400mph. The asteroid was discovered only last year, by astronomers in southern Spain. The team was operating from the La Sagra Sky Survey observatory near Granada in Spain. The observatory uses automated telescopes to track small asteroids and comets. 2012 DA14 was discovered after the astronomers decided to search areas of the sky where asteroids are not usually seen. Its orbital period around the sun is very close to our own, at 368 days, and it has made a close approach every year. This year's is the closest, say scientists - and the good news is that this is the closest it will get to Earth for at least three decades. Dr . Gerhard Drolshagen, a near-Earth object observer from the European . Space Agency's Space Situational Awareness (SSA) office, said: 'In future times the possibility of a collision cannot be completely excluded. It is highly unlikely, but the chance is greater than zero.' The asteroid's next very close shave with Earth will be in 2046, when it will squeak by us at a distance of 37,000 miles. And there's another close encounter in 97 years' time, on February 16 2110, when the chance that it will hit the Earth is 1 in 7,692,308,000.

"Apple's iPhone 7 could have a dramatically improved camera that uses two lenses to capture images rivalling those from professional cameras, it has been claimed. Highly regarded Apple blogger John Gruber said sources at Apple have spoken of 'the biggest ever camera jump' for the next version of the hugely successful iPhone. The handset is expected to be revealed in September. Scroll down for video . The new handset could use two camera lenses to create pictures that rival snaps from a professional camera, it has been claimed. The iPhone 6 featured a new 8-megapixel iSight camera. It included autofocus with Focus Pixels to improve quality, optical image stabilization (iPhone 6 Plus only) and a True Tone flash. The tip was revealed by Gruber in the latest episode of The Talk Show podcast, when he revealed he has heard 'from a birdie of a birdie' that Apple is working on the 'biggest camera jump ever' for the next iPhone. 'The specific thing I heard is that next years camera might be the biggest camera jump ever,' he said. 'I don't even know what sense this makes, but I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.' HTC's most recent phone, the M8, also comes with two lenses so that you can add 3-D effects to photos. However, Apple's approach is believes to be designed to add quality to pictures rather than create special effects. In the iPhone 6, there have been a whole host of technical improvements to the camera sensor, and in MailOnline's review, we said 'but in a nutshell, this is among the best cameras on any smartphone - and a huge leap forward from what was already a great camera in the iPhone 5.' The iPhone 6 offered a major improvement in camera quality- but the iPhone 7 promises an ever bigger leap. Both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cameras feature 'focus pixels' which let the auto focus work twice as fast, and be capable of taking 43 Megapixel panoramic photos. There is a dedicated hardware system within handset's A8 processor which will enable fast advanced face detection, and the larger 6 Plus has a new optical image stabilisation system. The smaller iPhone 6 will still come with a digital image stabiliser. The slow-motion video camera can take up to 240 frames a second, and allows you to slow footage down and speed it back up again at will.","Journalist John Gruber claims an insider at Apple made the revelation .

"Women are to be banned from  claiming free breast enlargements on the NHS as part of a new spending crackdown. Medical advisers working for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are drawing up rules which will prevent women from citing ‘psychological’ need in order to receive cosmetic enhancement at the taxpayers’ expense. Officials believe that an increasing number of women are ‘bending the system’ to secure enhancements which can cost up to £10,000 privately. Support: Rachel says her bra, unlike others, does not painfully cut in to breasts with implants . Some are thought to have been encouraged by internet sites which explain how women need to demonstrate emotional distress to get the operations signed off by doctors. Women can receive implants on the NHS if they can prove their breast size is responsible for mental conditions such as depression. Under the plans, the medical criteria will be tightened to eliminate all but the most extreme psychological cases. Reconstructive surgery is also offered on the health service following breast cancer treatment. The Government advisers are keen to draw a sharper distinction between genuine medical need, such as reductions for women whose large breasts cause back pain, and a desire to improve physical appearance. A senior NHS source said: ‘We don’t have any problem with women who have a genuine need for cosmetic  surgery for medical reasons, such as reconstructive surgery after breast cancer treatment. ‘But there has been a realisation that a growing number of women are bending the system by claiming a psychological need that cannot be justified.’ The Government advisers have been alarmed by websites such as ‘boobjobsontheservice.co.uk’ – which advises women as to their eligibility for free operations. Before and after: Josie Cunningham, 23, was a 32A (left) before the NHS surgery to boost her bust to a 36DD (right), but now wants the implants removed again . Nicola Allen posted: ‘Is Josie . Cunningham for real? NHS do your boobs for free when women that really . need it have to pay, & now you sue?’ The site appears to be funded by advertising from private clinics which stand to benefit if the women fail to persuade NHS doctors that they have a legitimate case. The clampdown could also have knock-on effects for other procedures  available on the NHS – such as ‘tummy tucks’ and wrinkle removal. The total cost of breast surgery on the NHS was £283 million last year, although this figure includes operations related to cancer and other  physical illnesses. NHS surgeons carried out 790 breast implant operations – technically called augmentation mammoplasty – costing the taxpayer approximately £3.5 million. If done privately, a procedure typically costs between £4,000 and £5,000. There were also 968 breast-lift operations, called mastopexies, on the NHS, costing taxpayers about £2 million more. The figures, from the Health And Social Care Information Centre, are distinct from operations where implants are used to help reconstruct the breast following mastectomy. A Department of Health spokesman said they did not have figures on the number of breast operations carried out for psychological reasons. Decisions about whether the procedures can be carried out on the NHS are taken at a local level, by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) on the basis of reports submitted by doctors. Each CCG sets its own criteria, but all are agreed that wanting to look better is not reason enough. The new rules are expected to be issued within the next few months. Earlier this year it was revealed that 23-year-old Josie Cunningham had a £5,000 NHS operation to increase her breasts from a size 32A to 36DD. She now wants them removed, at a further cost to taxpayers of £1,600 – because they have attracted too much ‘negative publicity’. Ms Cunningham argued the operation was justified due to the emotional distress she suffered as a result of having small breasts, saying: ‘I’ve paid taxes since I was 15. My case was not just about cosmetic changes, it was about my peace of mind.’ And in July mother-of-three Kelly McManus, 27, had a £5,000 tummy-tuck on the NHS after complaining that bearing children had given her a belly-bulge. She went to her GP saying her appearance was ‘leaving me depressed and ruining my sex life’, as she could not afford to go private. Signs that the Government were preparing to take a tougher line emerged last year in the wake of the PIP breast implant scandal. The Welsh government agreed to replace women’s implants for free on the NHS. But Andrew Lansley, Jeremy Hunt’s predecessor as Health Secretary, said the NHS would only fund removals. Women who wanted new implants would have to pay for them. Last night, the Department of Health said: ‘All NHS procedures should be carried out for clinical reasons based on a patient’s individual needs.’","Officials believe women are 'bending the system' to get free operations .

"From filthy clothes dangling from broken coat hangers to beds riddled with mould, these abandoned hotels are a world away from their luxurious past.

"Furious Ryanair passengers say they were left confused and out of pocket after their flight was diverted to a different island in the Canaries. The plane carrying 140 holidaymakers was heading to Lanzarote from Dublin on Saturday when it was forced to land on neighbouring Fuerteventura due to severe thunderstorms. Passengers say they were told they would be able to hop on a ferry to complete their journey, but claim they were crammed onto buses and taken to the port without proper instruction. The flight from Dublin to Lanzarote was diverted to Fuerteventura during stormy weather . A handful of passengers sent tweets to Ryanair to complain about the situation in Fuerteventura . Some grew frustrated with the lengthy wait at the airport and paid more than £30 for a taxi. Passenger Max Kyck, who managed to board the first bus, told The Journal that many holidaymakers bought ferry tickets at their own expense after being told that none had been reserved. At the airport, he said, a young worker tried to ‘herd’ all of the passengers outside to wait for buses, but she had no information about ferry tickets. He added: ‘When we got to the port shortly after 1pm there was nobody from Ryanair and nobody at the port knew anything about our tickets. ‘We waited a while and then bought tickets – €47 [£37] for two.’ Passengers say the airline didn't provide proper instruction on how to catch a ferry to Lanzarote . Passenger Max Kyck said he paid £37 for two ferry tickets to Lanzarote amid the confusion . Passengers had to pay for their own transport to their hotels once they arrived hours late in Lanzarote. Several passengers sent tweets to Ryanair to complain about the situation. Passenger Gareth Murran wrote: 'Your communication plan is shocking. 144 passengers left to make their own arrangements after flight diverted to Fuerteventura.' Passengers were diverted to Fuerteventura and forced to take a ferry to Lanzarote . Passengers say they were 'herded' outside and crammed onto buses when they landed in Fuerteventura . Ryanair has apologised for the diversion and offered refunds to those who are out of pocket over taxi or ferry costs. A spokesman for the Dublin-based airline told MailOnline Travel: 'All customers were transferred by ferry and coach from Fuerteventura to Lanzarote airport. ‘Customers who chose to make their own way to Fuerteventura are asked to submit receipted travel expenses for full reimbursement. ‘Ryanair sincerely apologised to all customers affected by this weather diversion.' Ryanair says it has apologised to all customers and offered refunds to those who still have their receipts . Passengers grew frustrated with the communication from Ryanair and the lengthy delay . A similar incident occurred in 2010 when more than 100 Ryanair passengers on a flight from Bournemouth to Lanzarote were diverted to Fuerteventura during a thunderstorm. The passengers complained about a lack of information from the airline and said they were forced to make their own travel arrangements to catch ferries and boats to Lanzarote. One family said it was left £400 out of pocket after they had to pay for hotel accommodation and a 30-minute ferry crossing the next day.","Plane carrying 140 holidaymakers was diverted to Fuerteventura .

"China is suspected of interfering with two U.S. government satellites in one of its most advanced hacking operations to date. On four occasions between 2007 and 2008 Chinese agents are said to have breached security on the environment-monitoring craft. The last hack was so effective that they could have completely taken control of the satellite, but did not do so. Gaining control: A report to Congress reveals efforts to hack into two government satellites in 2007 and 2008 were traced to a station in Norway . A Congressional report said that, . while it could not prove for sure China was behind the attacks, what . happened was ‘consistent’ with known Chinese cyber war techniques. Should a war begin China might be . able to take over satellites and either use them for their own ends or . manoeuvre them to destroy craft belonging to its enemies. The real-life Star Wars-style attacks . come amid rising tensions over China and calls by U.S. president Barack . Obama that it should ‘play by the rules’. The U.S. has just approved its . biggest long-term expansion of military presence in the Pacific since . the end of the Vietnam War in a bid to counterbalance China’s influence. Accusing report: The U.S.-China Economic Security and Review Commission report all-but blames China for the cyber attacks . Some 2,500 extra troops will now be stationed in Australia in a move which has infuriated Beijing. Yesterday President Obama said the Aisa/Pacific reg-on was America’s ‘top priority’, and that they were 'here to stay'. The satellite attacks were outlined in a report by the U.S.-China Economic Security and Review Commission. A Landsat-7 earth observation satellite system experienced 12 or more minutes of interference in October 2007 and July 2008. Ahead of the ASEAN summit today, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao demanded . that 'outside forces' had no excuse to get involved in the complex . maritime dispute in the South China Sea. It was a veiled warning to the U.S. and other countries to . keep out of the sensitive issue. He said: 'It ought to be resolved . through friendly consultations and discussions by countries directly . involved. Outside forces should not, under any pretext, get involved.' The remarks are the latest barbs . between the two countries in recent weeks, at a time when President . Barack Obama has sought to reassert U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific . region to counter the growing influence of China, its biggest economic . rival. The U.S. wants the South China Sea dispute discussed at the ASEAN summit, but will clearly face strong opposition from China. The South China Sea is a major route . for some $5 trillion in trade each year, as well as being potentially . rich in natural resources. Hackers also interfered with a Terra . AM-1 earth observation satellite twice, for two minutes in June 2008 and . nine minutes in October that year. During the final hack ‘the responsible party achieved all steps required to command the satellite’, but did not do so. Both craft use the commercially . operated Svalbard Satellite Station in Spitsbergen, Norway, that . ‘routinely relies on the Internet for data access and file transfers,’ the commission said, indicating this might have been how they were . attacked. The satellites affected were run by Nasa or the U.S. Geological Survey and were mostly used for climate observation. But the U.S. military and intelligence agencies also use them to communicate, collect intelligence and conduct reconnaissance. The report said China was the most . likely culprit, and that the techniques ‘appear consistent with . authoritative Chinese military writings’ that have advocated disabling a . foe’s satellite control facilities on the ground in a conflict. General Robert Kehler, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, stressed that the information available was ‘inconclusive’ He said: ‘First of all, I am familiar with the two incidents. The best information that I have is that we cannot attribute those two occurrences. I guess I would agree that we don’t have sufficient detail.' China has achieved several military . firsts in the past year, including testing a stealth bomber and aircraft . carrier and progress toward the first anti-ship ballistic missile. It has long been suspected of running . a sophisticated hacking operation, and was blamed for the world’s . largest such attack, dubbed ‘Operation Shady RAT’ - which included a . British defence contractor among its victims. Yesterday, in another show of force, . China’s unmanned spacecraft returned to Earth successfully after more . than two weeks in orbit, a pivotal point in its long-term space plans. Mr Obama is currently in Bali, Indonesia, where he is the first U.S. president to take part in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit. He is expecting a showdown with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao over tensions in the South China Sea, a key shipping channel of which China has claimed a huge stake. China’s embassy in Washington dismissed the satellite report, and said the commission was ‘vilifying China’s image’.","Environment-monitoring satellites targeted in attacks .

Tension: The protests were the latest in a long line of unrest that has seen millions take to the streets in Brazil to protest against the government . The gang ordered attacks on police, 106 officers - many off-duty - were killed. In the protests in Rio de Janeiro, a group of masked youths attacked shops, set fire to a police car and threw petrol bombs. In Sao Paulo shops were ransacked. Police responded with tear gas, pepper spray and sound bombs. Efforts . to transfer high-ranking imprisoned members of the gang, known by its . Portuguese initials PCC, to far off prisons where they would have . difficulty giving orders by cellphone to their soldiers on the outside . enraged the gang in 2006.

Five . days of gang-inspired attacks then left at least 175 dead, including . police officers, traffickers and the innocent in between. After the . violence lingered for months, an alleged informal truce between the . government and the PCC slowed the transfers and the attacks tapered off. The . gang was founded in 1993 by hardened criminals inside Sao Paulo's . Taubate Penitentiary, but remained a relatively obscure group until . early 2001, when uprisings in 29 prisons across the state killed 19 . inmates. It was the biggest prison rebellion in Brazil's recent history . and took police 27 hours to crush. The PCC was formed to pressure for improved prison conditions.

Preparations: The Olympic Village under construction in Rio de Janeiro this week. Violence could also threaten safety at the Olympic Games to be held in Brazil in 2016 . Brazilian . Justice Minister Jose Cardozo, speaking at a security conference last . year, said he would 'prefer to die' than serve time in his nation's . prisons. He added: 'We have a medieval penal system.' While the gang's start may have been rooted in fighting for basic human rights of the imprisoned, its members quickly began using their power inside prisons to direct drug-dealing and extortion operations on the outside. 'The PCC is better organized, more powerful, and they have a monopoly of crimes and power which is something nobody achieved in Rio,' said Ignacio Cano, a researcher at the Violence Analysis Center at Rio de Janeiro State University. 'They are by far the strongest criminal group in Brazil.' There are no official numbers on the gang's size, but the inner core considered as members is thought to include no more than a few thousand people, Cano said. Police documents obtained by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo last year indicated the gang's members numbered just over 1,300, and showed they are required to pay $300 in monthly fees in exchange for legal aid if they're arrested and support for their families if they go to jail. What makes the PCC so powerful is that corporate approach to how it manages gang enterprises as well as its reach beyond its core membership. 'They outsource. They contract people and allow them to carry out certain activities as long as they're paying them (the PCC) something in return,' Cano said. 'For example, in 2006 many people say the killings of policemen were outsourced.' Estimates of the number of people connected in some way to the gang go as high as 100,000.","The threat was issued by the First .

"They are tiny eight legged mites, related to spiders and look rather like an ice cream cone with stubby legs at one end. Yet although you may not recognise, scientists say they are living on your face right now. A new study found the mites, invisible to the naked eye, in 100% of the people they tested. Scroll down for video . D. brevis is slightly shorter and rounder, and spends most of its life nestled deeply inside a hair follicle sebum (oil) gland.

D. folliculorum live more shallowly in the hair follicle . Called Demodex, they live in our hair follicles, buried head-down, eating the oils we secrete., . Human faces host two species of mites -- Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis -- and they aren't that close of relatives. Megan Thoemmes, a graduate student at North Carolina State University, told NPR. 'They're actually pretty cute. 'With their eight little legs, they look like they're almost swimming through the oil.' 'It's like having friends with you all the time,' Thoemmes says. 'Realizing that everyone has them and they're likely not causing any problems, it's pretty reassuring.' In DNA tests of 29 people, 100 percent of those over age 18 carried DNA from Demodex mites, the team found in their study in the journal PLOS One. Tests on more people have also come up with the same 100 percent number, Thoemmes says. Scientists don't know how the mites spread among humans; one theory is that they're passed on from mother to child while breast-feeding. Young people are much less likely to have them, while they've been found on almost all cadavers. The mites probably crawl on our faces at night, when it's dark. D. folliculorum live more shallowly in the hair follicle . Demodex have likely been living with us for a long, long time; as early humans walked out of Africa and found their way around the globe, the researchers say. They found that mites from China are genetically distinct from mites from the Americas. East Asians and European populations diverged over 40,000 years ago and so far it looks like their mites did as well. 'Demodex have likely been living with us for a long, long time; as early humans walked out of Africa and found their way around the globe, they probably carried their mites with them,' said Michelle Trautwein, adjunct assistant professor of entomology at NC State and Schlinger Chair of Dipterology at the California Academy of Sciences. 'So we want to know if Demodex DNA can provide a reflection of our own evolutionary history by allowing us to retrace those ancient paths of human migration. 'One of the most intriguing (and unsolved) face mite mysteries is how humans acquired these beasties. 'Perhaps these mites are a model system of co-evolution. It’s possible that as every species of mammal evolved, so did their mites – each one particularly adapted to its changed environs.'","Called Demodex, they live in our hair follicles, buried head-down, eating the oils we secrete.

"The mother and maternal grandparents of an 8-year-old Pennsylvania boy doctors said 'looked like a Holocaust survivor' were ordered on Thursday to stand trial on attempted murder and other charges for allegedly denying the boy food regularly and hiding him from public view. District Judge Brian Arthur was so shocked by pictures presented in court and by medical reports of the boy's condition after he was removed from the family's Greenville home in June that the judge ordered the three defendants jailed and set bail at $100,000 each. Police allege the boy was fed only small amounts of food so he turned to eating bugs when he was allowed onto the back porch. Trial set: Mary C. Rader, in white, and her mother, Deana Beighly, center, are lead by sheriff's deputies from the courthouse to an awaiting police vehicle on Thursday . The boy was 7 and weighed 25 pounds when caseworkers took him to Greenville Medical Center, where a doctor reported: 'The young man is so emaciated he looks like a Holocaust survivor.' A doctor said he was one month from dying. The judge's decision drew applause from about 60 courtroom spectators - friends, relatives and some complete strangers to the boy - some of whom gasped when the pictures a Mercer County caseworker took of the boy this summer were flashed on a video screen minutes earlier. Lawyers for the boy's mother, Mary Rader, 28; his grandmother, Deana Beighley, 48; and his step-grandfather, Dennis Beighley, 59; expressed disappointment that their clients were jailed. The three family members had been released from custody after they were charged July 17. Rader and the grandparents contend the boy has a growth hormone problem. Tragic: Beighley, left, and Rader, right are accused of starving the 8-year-old boy. The boy was removed from his home in June when a neighbor noticed his 'skeletal' appearance . 'I think . there's no question what happened here was a tragedy, but the question . is who's responsible for it and whether it's a criminal offense,' Rader's attorney Jack Cline said. Neil . Rothschild, an attorney for the grandmother, told the judge the adults . may be guilty of not seeking proper medical attention for a boy who 'had . trouble keeping his weight on' but nothing more. 'It sounds more to me like a situation that got away from them,' Rothschild said. County Detective John Piatek, one of two witnesses at the hearing, has said he believes the grandmother disliked the boy and influenced the others to mistreat him, but the detective didn't testify about that Thursday. He told the judge that one next door neighbor thought Rader, who has four children, had only three children because the neighbor only saw two girls and a boy playing outside. District Attorney Robert Kochems said the starved boy - identified in testimony only by his initials A.R. - was purposely kept from public view. When a neighbor finally did see him on June 6, she called to report 'what she said appeared to be a walking skeleton,' county welfare worker Kendra Manning testified. Home: One next door neighbor thought Rader, who has four children, had only three children because the neighbor only saw two girls and a boy playing outside the home, pictured . Medical personnel noted that the boy's bones protruded so sharply that his skin broke open in some areas, and a doctor at Children's Hospital of UPMC in Pittsburgh, where he was eventually transferred, concluded he was a month from dying. Deana Beighley's attorney noted that the boy told a caseworker he ate three meals a day, was treated kindly, and sometimes forced himself to vomit after meals. But the prosecutor said the boy ate and gained weight normally once he was hospitalized, and has gained about 20 pounds. Kochems said the boy's statements that he was decently treated can be explained by his perspective as a child. 'He doesn't know that they're trying to kill him,' Kochems said. 'We do.' All four of Rader's children have been placed in foster care.","Mary Rader, 28, and her parents, Deana Beighley, 48; and, Dennis Beighley, 59; were ordered Thursday to stand trial on attempted murder charges .

"Many of us embark on quick-fix diets to get beach ready at the 11th hour. But juice cleanses and trendy diets such as the raw food plan can wreak havoc with your teeth, an expert has warned. As well as tooth decay, other non-desirable side effects such as bad breath and extra bacteria in the mouth can be the result of extreme dieting efforts, says  Dr Sameer Patel, Clinical Director at London-based dental practice elleven. Here, he reveals the worst dental offenders when it comes to dieting... Scroll down for video . Fad diets such as juicing, low carb and meal replacement plans might be good for the waistline - but may wreak havoc with your teeth, a dental expert has warned . Low calorie diets such as the juice cleanse, popular . with celebrities including Salma Hayek (left) and Kate Hudson (right) can damage teeth and gums, says Dr Sameer Patel, Clinical Director at dental practice elleven . THE JUICE CLEANSE . said that low calorie diets like the juice cleanse, which is popular . with celebrities including Salma Hayek and Kate Hudson, can damage your . teeth and gums. The diet, which sees people swap meals for smoothies and juices, causes insulin levels to peak and then plummet which, over time, alters the structure of collagen in the body and affects the gums because collagen fibres hold teeth in place, he explained. The juice from fruit and vegetables tend to have a high acid content, which severely damages the enamel of your teeth in a similar way to fizzy drinks. Dr Patel explained that while fruit and vegetables are considered healthy acids, this is only the case when they are consumed as a whole, rather than as a concentrated juice. ‘Fruit’s natural sugar, fructose, is a common cause of cavities as the bacteria in the mouth feed on it, so be careful when you do consume juice as part of a balanced diet.’ He advises drinking juice through a straw and waiting half an hour before brushing your teeth afterwards. Celebrities including Miranda Kerr (left) and . Benedict Cumberbatch are said to follow the 5: 2 diet. This is an eating . plan when people eat a low-carb-high-protein diet (such as a chicken salad, right) and on ‘fast days’ their bodies breaks down fat . Trendy diets are leaving millions of Britons with stomach aches and other digestive problems, according to new research. Just under half of all adults suffer some pain when they try and lose weight and 55 per cent of people aged 25-34 – who are most likely to try ‘faddy’ diets - are in discomfort. A report by Potter's Cleansing Herbs Tea said that the age group was most likely to try regimes such as Atkins and Cabbage Soup. In a survey of 2,000 adults, it found that half are on a diet. Those suffering stomach ache are likely to give up their quest to lose weight and pile on the pounds. Health expert Dr Chris Etheridge said: ""It is so important to be aware our digestive health can affect our weight, with so many of us apparently unable to maintain our weight at a healthy level.’ ‘Keeping our digestive health in tip-top condition is vital for weight management as well as our overall health.’ THE 5:2 DIET /  LOW-CARB, HIGH-PROTEIN DIET . Celebrities . including Miranda Kerr and Benedict Cumberbatch are said to follow the . 5: 2 diet. This is an eating plan when people eat a . low-carb-high-protein diet and on ‘fast days’ their bodies breaks down . fat. ‘This . process results in your body going into a state called ketosis which . produces the chemicals that cause bad breath,’ Dr Patel said. ‘Ketosis . is brought on entirely by your diet and unfortunately no amount of . flossing and brushing will combat the smell so think twice before . cutting out carbs completely and stick to healthy ones such wholemeal . pasta and wholemeal bread – these will keep bad breath away whilst . staying trim.’ MILKSHAKE DIETS . A number of ‘milkshake plans’ encourage people to swap two meals a day for a calorie-controlled milkshake, but the drinks can contain up to 18g of sugar per serving. The drinks, consumed by celebrities including Shane Warne, can cause tooth decay and promote plaque build-up which leads to cavities which cannot be washed or brushed away, Dr Patel warned. He advises dieters to read the label of such shakes carefully to choose the least sugary options as well as rinsing their mouths with water or chewing gum afterwards to reduce the effect on the milkshakes might have on their teeth. 'HEALTHY MEAL REPLACEMENTS' ‘Diet . plans that offer people ready-made calorie controlled meal . replacements, tend to take out the fat and replace it with extra sugar . and salt to keep the flavour. This can be extremely damaging to your . teeth,’ Dr Patel said. Some . replacement snacks are higher in sugar than regular snacks and people . who snack are at higher risk of tooth decay because eating between meals . increases the contact between sugar and teeth throughout the day. As . well as cooking low calorie meals at home, where the salt and sugar . content can be monitored, the dentist recommends that people switch . coffee for green tea, which reduces teeth staining and helps to fight . bacterial infection and inflammation. 'Milkshake plans’ encourage people to swap two meals a day for a calorie-controlled milkshake (illustrated right), but the drinks can contain up to 18g of sugar per serving. Shane Warne (left) is said to have followed such a plan, which can cause tooth decay and promote plaque build-up . RAW FOOD DIET . While . sticking to raw foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, like . celebrities such as Demi Moore and Scarlett Johansson, sounds like a . healthy plan, they can damage your teeth. ‘Despite . the sugars in fruit being natural, when they make their way into your . mouth, there is no difference between the sugars from fruit and the . sugars from chocolate or sweets,’ he said. ‘All . this sugar is constantly eroding your teeth and acts like a time bomb. Small problems mount up on each tooth, leading to cavities and larger . dental issues which can be painful and very expensive to resolve.’ Dr . Patel also warned that nuts and seeds are easily lodged between teeth . so it is easier for bacteria to attach to teeth and multiply. He advises . that people floss or chew gum after a snack of nuts.

"A lack of space in aircraft carry-on bags is a huge gripe for travellers. And for tourists who like to buy souvenirs and holiday bargains, it can mean buying a second suitcase to return home with. However, a new design is promising to be the world’s most revolutionary luggage for shopaholics – by inflating from a carry-on size to the maximum check-in baggage size at the push of a button. Scroll down for video... The bag expands by inflating the side walls with air pressure through a built-in electric pump . Additional benefits include removable storage shelves and a portable table top feature . Called Fugu, and currently crowdsourcing for funds on Kickstarter, the case has been measured to comply with airline size limitations. Its name is inspired by the Fugu fish, which is the Japanese word for pufferfish, and expands by inflating the side walls with air pressure through a built-in electric pump. It inflates from the maximum carry-on size to the maximum check-in size that passengers are allowed on board a plane. Described as the 'Mary Poppins bag of suitcases,' the luggage features removable shelves, which enable the suitcase to double as a storage unit, can be used as a portable table, a makeshift laptop stand or make-up dresser. The light-weight suitcase is also extremely durable and has shock-absorbing walls to protect your belongings . Two for the price of one! It's easily-collapsible design also allows for easier storage at home . Made from the same material used to make surfboards, the bag also has shock-absorbing walls to protect its cargo. Isaac Atlas, Inventor, Founder and Industrial Designer, said: 'When we started working with the lab one of our main challenges was making it both strong and low-weight. ‘As you can see… it’s pretty strong.’ Isaac says he got the idea for Fugu in early 2013 after arguing with his wife over what size luggage he should take on a trip. ‘The idea for FUGU came from my wife,' he explains in the video. A fully-functioning prototype of the 'Mary Poppins bag of suitcases' now exists but the company has only reached about 50% of their donation goals on Kickstarter . The bag is also completely waterproof and has tyres that move 360 degrees in all directions . The answer to the suitcase dilemma has arrived! With FUGU LUGGAGE, you no longer need to choose . 'She kept telling me that I needed a larger suitcase for my travels and I kept stubbornly saying, ""Carry on is enough"". 'Obviously she was right, but instead of admitting that to her, I invented Fugu luggage.’ The lightweight suitcase is also extremely durable and has shock-absorbing walls to protect belongings . FUGU is a revolutionary suitcase that expands from maximum carry-on size to maximum check-in size . The bag is also  waterproof and has tyres that move 360 degrees in all directions . With just 18 days to go, the company has already received $214,475 (£137,000) in pledges – beyond its $50,000 goal. If all goes according to plan, development for Fugu, which is in the prototype stage, should be completed and mass produced by early next year. The Israel-based company hopes to sell the all-in-one bag for $300 (or approximately £191) and it will be available in a range of colours.","New bag can inflate from carry-on to maximum check-in size .

"The US spying scandal deepened today as Secretary of State John Kerry said it is 'not unusual' for governments to bug the offices of their allies sparking fierce retorts from France and Germany. The extraordinary statement has angered leaders across the world after leaked documents revealed America spied on 38 foreign missions and embassies including the European Union's Washington nerve centre. As outrage grew across the EU over the damaging revelations, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was first to lash out, declaring that 'bugging friends is unacceptable' before French premier Francois Hollande demanded its 'immediate halt'. Scroll down for video . False friends? John Kerry, left, said spying on foreign allies was 'not unusual' while France's Francois Hollande, right, demanded an explanation and an 'immediate halt' Avoid eye contact: Angela Merkel said, if true, 'spying on friends is unacceptable' just a week after she and US President Barack Obama shared a glass of wine during his visit to Berlin . The document also lists the large range of . spying methods used to infiltrate the 'targets' including bugging phones, . tapping cables and intercepting transmissions with far-reaching . antennae. Speaking to a press conference today, Kerry said: 'I will say that every country in the world that is engaged in international affairs and national security undertakes lots of activities to protect its national security and all kinds of information contributes to that. All I know is that is not unusual for lots of nations.' Whistleblower: Edward Snowden leaked a document which allegedly showed U.S. spooks had spied on the EU in America . But the remarks did not wash with Francois Hallande who demanded an immediate explanation, adding: 'We cannot accept this kind of . behavior. 'We demand . that this cease immediately.' He asked for an immediate explanation. Angela Merkel waded into the row, saying: 'If it is confirmed that diplomatic . representations of the European Union and individual European countries . have been spied upon, we will clearly say that bugging friends is . unacceptable. 'We are no longer in the Cold War.' Meanwhile, Martin Schulz, president of the EU Parliament, told French radio the United . States had crossed a line. He told France 2: 'I was always sure that dictatorships, some authoritarian systems, tried . to listen ... but that measures like that are now practiced by an ally, by a . friend, that is shocking, in the case that it is true.' The rift grew as a document leaked by fugitive ex-CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden claimed the U.S. secretly bugged EU offices in America. Spooks at the National Security Agency (NSA) nobbled EU internal . computer networks in Washington and at the 27-member bloc's UN office in . New York, according to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine. Microphones were installed in the building and and the computer network compromised, . 'giving the agency access to emails and internal documents.' One of the documents, revealed by The Guardian, reportedly pinpoints 38 embassies and missions which it refers to as 'targets'. The aim, it suggests, is to uncover inside knowledge of policy disagreements on global issues and other schisms between member states. The document, dated September 2010 . and classified 'strictly confidential', has created a diplomatic rift . between America and Europe. Targeted: The 27-bloc EU offices at the UN building in New York was spied on by the U.S. National Security Agency . Another 2007 document outlines one . operation, codenamed 'Dropmire', which involved planting a bug 'on the . Cryptofax at the EU embassy, DC', a reference to the encrypted fax . system used to send cables to European ministries. Martin . Schultz, head of the European Parliament, has demanded 'full . clarification' from the U.S. and said that if the report was true, it . would have a 'severe impact'. He said it would be 'a huge scandal', and cause a 'big strain' on the relations between the EU and the U.S. Luxembourg . Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said U.S. spying was 'out of control, . adding: 'The U.S. would do better to monitor its intelligence services . instead of its allies.' The document allegedly referred to the EU as a 'target'. Details of European positions on trade and military . matters would have been useful to those involved in negotiations . between Washington and European governments, says the BBC's Stephen Evans. Der Spiegel claims the document, was leaked by Snowden, a contracted analyst with the CIA who has since requested asylum in Ecuador after revealing the existence of the so-called PRISM surveillance  programme. The top-secret PRISM programme collects . and analyses information from internet and phone users around the world, . with access to data from Google, Yahoo! and other Internet firms. U.S.officials say the information gathered is vital in the fight against . global terrorism. The news comes as both Russia and Ecuador appeared to distance themselves today from NSA leaker Edward Snowden. No refuge: A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin suggested Snowden would not find refuge in Moscow, adding: '[Snowden] is not a topic on the agenda of the Kremlin' Request: Vice president Joe Biden, left, has asked Ecuador's president Rafael Correa, right, to reject an asylum plea by Edward Snowden and his appeal appeared to have been heeded . In an interview with Ekho Moskvy radio, a spokesman for President . Vladimir Putin suggested Snowden would not find refuge in Moscow, adding: '[Snowden] is not a topic on the agenda of the Kremlin.' Meanwhile, Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, also appeared to step back some of his country’s apparent earlier support for Snowden. In an interview with The Associated Press, he said Snowden is 'under the care of the Russian . authorities' and that 'the case is not in Ecuador’s hands.' 'If he arrives at an Ecuadorean embassy we’ll analyze his request for asylum,' he added. Snowden is believed to be currently . staying at Moscow's airport where he arrived last weekend from Hong . Kong. America has charged him with theft of government property, unauthorised . communication of national defence information and wilful communication . of classified communications intelligence. Each charge carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Vice President Joe Biden called Correa, asking him to reject an asylum request made by Snowden, it was revealed yesterday. ‘They did discuss Snowden, but I don't have additional details,’ Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama in Africa. It's the highest-level conversation between the U.S. and Ecuador that has been publicly disclosed since Ecuador began considering the possibility of offering Snowden a sanctuary.","Microphones were put in building and computers compromised as spooks targeted EU in Washington and UN offices in New York .

"London has come out on top as the most popular city for a New Year break. British and world travellers want to ring in 2015 in the UK capital more than any other destination in the world, according to a TripAdvisor study. And visitors to London will escape the worst of the price hikes that other cities have put on New Year's Eve hotel rates. Spectacular: Britons and world travellers have made London the most popular New Year's Eve break . According to the poll, the average nightly hotel price for New Year’s Eve in London is £160.50, which is only five per cent above the average rate for 2014. In Edinburgh, the second-most popular city for a New Year break with Britons, the average hotel price is £149.28, which is 20 per cent higher than normal. Prices in Blackpool, averaging £105.71 for a New Year's Eve stay, are 32 per cent above normal. Revellers gather for the New Year's Eve fireworks display in London on December 31, 2013 . Of the most popular destinations for Britons, New York has the highest New Year's Eve rates . British holidaymakers who are heading to the Big Apple to watch its traditional Times Square ball-drop ceremony can expect big prices. Of the ten most popular destinations for Britons, New York has the highest New Year’s Eve rates, at £255.46 on average, which is 18 per cent higher than normal. But the biggest price hike is found in Dubai, where the average rate of £164.39 is 60 per cent higher than normal on New 31 December. This New Year’s Eve, almost a third of British travellers will be going away, with one in eight (12 per cent) choosing to head somewhere in the UK and one in five (19 per cent) venturing abroad, according to TripAdvisor. Amsterdam is one of the top five New Year's Eve destinations for Britons . After London and Edinburgh, the most popular New Year’s Eve destinations for Britons are New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Dubai and Blackpool. Berlin, Sydney (where prices have jumped by 50 per cent) and Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, round out the top ten. For world travellers, the top destinations are London, New York and Paris. TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said in a statement: ‘Many destinations experience significant price hikes over the new year when it comes to hotels, so it's worth doing your research before deciding on where to head for the celebrations.’ Earlier this year, a study by MasterCard predicted London would be the most popular tourist destination in 2014 with 18.7 million international visitors.","Average nightly hotel price for 31 December in London is £160.50 .

"They have become a quick and easy way of learning about everything from world affairs to the affairs of friends. But Twitter and Facebook may be eroding our ability to think. Researchers believe speed, volume and ease with which information is shared through social networking sites may be making it more difficult for us to think analytically. Is Twitter making us less intelligent? New research suggests we prefer to seek answers from the masses rather than work things out for ourselves . The computing expert studied how being part of a network of people affects how we learn. Dr Rahwan began by asking a group of 20 people three trick questions over and over again. For example they were told that and bat and ball cost £1.10 in total and that the bat cost £1 more than the ball, and then they were asked to work out how much the ball costs. The intuitive answer is 10p but the correct answer is actually 5p. Despite being repeatedly asked the . questions, people tended to stick with their original answers and only . got them correct around a quarter of the time. The study asked volunteers to work out the cost of a bat and ball if together they cost £1.10 but the bat was £1 more expensive than the ball. Dr Rahwan says social networks our destroying our ability to think analytically and answer 'taxing' questions like this . Dr Rahwan then gave the same questions to a second group of people.  They first answered the questions alone but then were put in groups and able to see each other’s responses. Given the first question, the men and women quickly realised when someone else in their social network had the right answer and changed theirs accordingly. However, they did no better initially on the second question, or the third. A recent study suggests nearly half of all 16 to 19-year-olds log onto Facebook every month. 26 percent of teenagers in the same age bracket use Twitter every month says market research firm GlobalWebIndex. But 25 to 34-year-olds make up the largest share of users across all social network . According to the study Facebook and Twitter usage actually increased in 2013. And there seems to be no end in sight, with new social networks continuing to pull in more users. This surprised Dr Rahwan, who said it suggests that the volunteers were copying the answers without putting any real thought into what they were doing. By not computing that they shouldn’t rush in with their first answer but take time to think the question over, they fell into the same trap each time. Dr Rahwan, who is based at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, said: ‘We think people are unwilling to reflect more because it takes time and effort and in daily life we don’t have the luxury of time to verify everything.’ He said that while we have long learned from others, there is a danger that the rise of information-sharing websites such as Twitter and Facebook will make us rely more and more on the opinion of others. This could erode our ability to think critically and make us lazy because we assume that there will always be someone else who knows the answer. And while much of the information we glean will be helpful, there is a chance we will believe dangerous advice. Finally, while we may seem smarter because we have lots of information at our fingertips, any boost to intelligence is purely superficial, the Journal of the Royal Society Interface reports. The researcher, who has a Facebook account but hasn’t used it for months, advises that we take more time to stop and think for ourselves and that we carry out detailed research on important topics. Dr Rahwan has focused on Twitter and Facebook because, like his study, they involve information being shared through networks of people. But previous research has blamed internet search engines such as Google for making it harder for us to remember facts. A study published in the journal Science found that we are more likely to forget things if we think we can find them again online. We are also better at remembering where to look for something on the internet than we are at storing the information itself.","Twitter and Facebook could be lowering your ability to think analytically .

Seeing faces in unusual and random objects is nothing new. The phenomenon is called Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in random, unconnected data.

Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there. For instance, the Viking 1 Mars orbiter in 1976 sparked infamous claims of a 'Face on Mars.' In 1976 Nasa sent two spacecraft called Viking 1 and Viking 2 to the Cydonia region of Mars. Both spacecraft took images of the planet's surface and beamed them back to Nasa scientists on Earth. One image, taken on 25 July 1976 by Viking 1, showed what appeared to be a face in the rocks.

"One of America's richest businessmen has denied claims that he was detained following a car accident in Cuba after 'hitting a local kid with his car'. Daniel S. Loeb, the hedge fund manager who founded Third Point LLC, was involved in an accident while enjoying a weekend trip to Cuba, according to Vanity Fair. The piece, written for the magazine's December edition, alleges that the incident happened while Loeb, 51, was on holiday with friends in 2002. But Mr Loeb's lawyer told the New York Post that the allegations are 'entirely untrue'. Firm denial: Lawyers representing hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, pictured, have denied that he 'hit a local kid' in a car in Cuba in 2002 . Mr Loeb is number 341 on the Forbes 400 list of America's richest people and is said to be worth $1.65billion (£1.02billion). In the Vanity Fair piece William D. Cohan claims that Mr Loeb was accompanied on the trip by his friend Alexander von Furstenberg. But Mr Cohan writes that 'things unexpectedly took a dark turn.' According to vanity Fair, former Third Point analyst Youlia Miteva, who accused Loeb of breach of contract in a lawsuit, said: 'Cuban authorities had refused to allow him to leave'.' Mr Cohan adds that earlier this year, while compiling a separate Vanity Fair piece, Mr Loeb told him that he had been involved in a car accident, and 'stuck around' for a couple of weeks before a legal hearing. Controversy: Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb has criticised Sony for two film flops this summer . The article adds that a former friend of Loeb, hedge funder Robert Chapman Jr told Cohan that Loeb had called him 'desperate' and 'sobbing' from a hotel room in Cuba. He told Mr Cohan 'how scared' Loeb had sounded when giving details of the incident 'involving his hitting a Cuban kid with his car'. According to the New York Post, Mr Loeb's art dealer friend Christophe Van de Weghe, who claims to have been in Cuba at the time of the accident, denies that Loeb ever spent any time in prison. Mr Loeb's lawyer told the Post: 'The statements you attribute to Mr Chapman, Gross and an 'unidentified source' are entirely untrue, defamatory and libelous, and will be treated as such.' MailOnline has attempted to contact Third Point and Mr Loeb's lawyer and is awaiting a response. Mr Loeb hit the headlines earlier this year when actor George Clooney hit out at 'inflammatory' comments the hedge fund manager made about the movie industry. In an interview with Deadline.com, the star called billionaire Loeb a 'carpetbagger', claiming the Wall Street tycoon 'knows nothing' about the film business. Loeb's Third Point hedge fund controls seven percent of Sony stock and he had criticised Sony Entertainment after its two big budget films After Earth and White House Down, 'bombed spectacularly' at the box office.

"A British couple is taking legal action over claims that their Turkish honeymoon was ruined by ‘horrendous’ gastric symptoms that led to their daughter being hospitalised. Simon and Davina Nordemann were away with their six children and young grandson when five members of the family suffered diarrhoea, sickness, stomach cramps and nausea. The family, from Mickleover, Derby, stayed at the four-star Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa, where they claim to have witnessed other children vomiting around the pool area. The Nordemanns' daughter, Kacey, was hospitalised for 24 hours after falling seriously ill . The Nordemanns said their 10-year-old daughter, Kacey, became so ill that she had to be taken to hospital to be treated for dehydration. They said it was a ‘terrifying’ ordeal because Kacey was attached to an intravenous drip for 24 hours. Simon, a 41-year-old engineer for Rolls Royce, said: ‘We decided we wanted to spend our honeymoon all together as a family and we were all really excited to have some quality time together in what we hoped would be luxurious surroundings. 'Devastated': Simon and Davina Nordemann (centre, back) say their honeymoon was ruined by illness . Thomas Cook says it continues to investigate the source of the illness . ‘But we soon realised that the restaurant wasn’t what we had expected and we heard lots of other guests talking about falling ill. 'We were horrified when we saw children being sick by the pool and in the restaurant area but what made it worse was that none of the hotel staff seemed in a hurry to clear it up.’ He said the family members who fell ill were largely confined to their hotel rooms, including Kacey, who was seen by the hotel’s doctor. The couple chose to go on honeymoon with their children so they could spend quality time together . He added: ‘Davina rushed with her to a local hospital in Bodrum where she was kept in for 24 hours. 'It was really scary for them being in a foreign country and having to go to hospital and not what you expect to happen. ‘The trip was completely ruined and we’re devastated as it wasn’t just any holiday – it was our honeymoon. ‘What was meant to be a dream holiday turned into a total nightmare and now we will always have memories of our honeymoon for all the wrong reasons.’ Daughters Hannah, Kacey and Amelia pose for a photo during the family getaway . Popular: The family stayed at a four-star resort in Bodrum, Turkey . In addition to Simon and Kacey, daughter Amelia, 12, son Kyle, 21, and three-year-old grandson, Brayden, also fell ill. Davina, a 41-year-old nurse, son Harry, 15, daughter Hannah, eight, and Davina’s daughter, Rebecca, 23, from a previous relationship, were the only family members not to fall ill during their stay in Bodrum last summer. The family claims to have witnessed flies and birds in the restaurant near the buffet, old food being topped with new food in the buffet stands, and half-used bottles of water being topped up with water from containers which other people had used. The Nordemanns say ‘dozens’ of other guests were sick at the resort and vomit in public areas wasn’t cleaned up promptly. The family booked with Thomas Cook and the five members who fell ill have hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate their claims and the source of their illness. Irwin Mitchell said it also represents holidaymakers who travelled to the resort in September 2012, although the case has not been resolved. Simon and Davina Nordemann arrived in Turkey two days after their wedding in the UK . Jatinder Paul, a personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘This should have been the best time of their lives but sadly this couple’s honeymoon with their family was ruined due to Simon and four other family members falling ill and the family understandably want to know why this was the case. ‘Gastric illness is not only unpleasant but can result in serious consequences, especially for young children and the family were extremely worried when Kacey had to go to hospital. ‘We hope that Thomas Cook will work with us as we investigate the conditions at the Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa. ‘Nothing can turn back the clock and make up for the fact that the couple’s honeymoon was ruined, but we hope to gain some answers for the family to help them move forward from their ordeal.’ Tourists flock to Bodrum for its beaches and ancient attractions, including the Halicarnassus castle . In a statement, a Thomas Cook spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘Thomas Cook takes health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our customers is our number one priority. ‘We confirm that the Nordemann family reported falling ill while on holiday in July 2014 at the Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa. ‘We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, and Thomas Cook operates both a quality assurance programme and routinely undertakes independent third party audits to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.’ ‘We are confident that those due to stay at the Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from Thomas Cook.’ The tour operator said it continues to investigate the illness.","Simon and Davina Nordemann travelled with their children and grandson .

"Sir Winston Churchill's bravery in leading Britain during the Second World War may have been down to him suffering 'short man syndrome', a new book by Boris Johnson has claimed. The Mayor of London says that with the wartime prime minister standing at just five feet six inches tall, there is evidence to suggest he was driven to succeed to prove a point to bigger bullies at school, who teased him for his height. So-called 'short man syndrome' has been described by scientists where short men overcompensate for their lack of height through acts of aggression. Scroll down for video . A new biography of wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill by Boris Johnson suggests he may have suffered from 'short-man' syndrome . The Mayor of London says there is evidence to suggest he was driven to succeed to prove a point to bullies at school, who teased him for his height . It has long been associated with some of history's most notorious tyrants, including Adolf Hitler, Napoleon, Mussolini and Stalin. And in Mr Johnson's new biography on Churchill, who was two inches shorter than Hitler, he suggests the syndrome was what spurred him on to tackle bigger bullies. In the book, serialised in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson writes: 'Who else was 5 foot 6 or under? Some of the biggest tyrants and creeps in world history: Augustus (5 feet 6), Napoleon (ditto), Mussolini (ditto) Stalin (teensy at 5 feet 4). Hitler was only 5 feet 8. 'All these characters have been associated with the over-compensatory aggression that is sometimes referred to as 'short-man' syndrome; and there is some evidence, at least on the face of it, that Churchill did, too.' At five foot eight, Hitler, left, was two inches taller than Winston Churchill. So-called 'short-man' syndrome is often referred to as Napoleon Complex, named after Napoleon Bonaparte, right, who was five feet seven . The new book, called The Churchill Factor, took the author over a year to research and will be published later this month ahead of the 50th anniversary of the leader's death. In it Mr Johnson also explains how Churchill's early life as a pupil at the prestigious Harrow School may have led him to show he was made of stern stuff after being bullied for being a 'runt'. He explains that Churchill was not in the Harrow football team, the school's more violent version of the game, or the cricket team and even ran away from other pupils on one occasion when they threw cricket balls at him. He also suggests that he probably would have been picked on for his lisp and speech impediment too. Mr Johnson, who himself is five feet ten inches tall, adds: 'Churchill's bravery wasn't something he just put on. It wasn't a mask he struggled with. He was made like that. The spirit of derring-do just pumped through his veins, like some higher-octane fuel than the one the rest of us run on. Nothing could stop him.' However, Mr Johnson explains that what sets Churchill apart from other 20th Century leaders was his 'greatness of heart' and his ability to be immensely compassionate. He points out that when Churchill's mother decided to sack his nanny, he used his small income to give her financial support as he was so appalled. Studies into so-called short-man syndrome say that society's obsession with height forces smaller men to overcompensate by becoming chippy, more aggressive and - in extreme cases - lust power. However, some have questioned whether the syndrome, sometimes called Napoleon complex after Napoleon Bonaparte is real. Historians have also pointed out that at 5 feet 7, Napoleon was around the average height for his day. Mr Johnson also points out that tyrants Mussolini, left, and Stalin, right, have also been associated with short-man syndrome . Meanwhile Mr Johnson has also said he believed the wartime leader would have approved of Parliament’s decision to back air strikes on ISIS. He made the comments after revealing thousands of terror suspects in the UK are being monitored by the security services. 'I think he would be appalled by the spectacle of these cowards executing journalists, and I think he would have wanted to do something to set them back a long way, and if need be, to neutralise them altogether,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘He was a great believer in air power – don’t forget he invented the RAF – so I think he’d do exactly what the Prime Minister is doing.’","Boris Johnson says Churchill may have suffered from short-man syndrome .

"A photographer in South Dakota, has captured an extremely rare and stunning sight of a meteor speeding towards the Earth's atmosphere. While on a family holiday in the woods in Custer, South Dakota, Wes Eisenhauer set up his camera on a clear, but rather uneventful night in hopes of getting some shots of the Milky Way. 'The sky was incredibly clear and free of any light pollution so I set my camera up, composed the shot, and let my camera click for about an hour while I went inside,' Wes told MailOnline. A photographer in South Dakota, USA, managed to capture a fireball meteor plunging into earth's atmosphere . The meteor appeared to break apart in a flash - and disappear into a stunning ring of dust . 'I didn't even look at the pictures for about a week,' he wrote. 'Then I decided to upload them and have a look - and discovered the meteor.' Upon replaying his time-lapse footage, he spotted the quick movement and sudden pop as the space rock appears to break apart in the sky. Meteors can travel at speeds up to 50 miles per second and when they disperse - in this instance, into a ring of dust - it happens in a flash. Meteors can travel at speeds up to 50 miles per second and such a sighting is extremely rare . As stunning as the footage is, Wes, who primarily works as a wedding photographer, insists it was mostly just dumb luck. 'I randomly set my camera up and pointed it at that portion of the sky at that very moment,' he told MailOnline. 'I got pretty lucky, but I always try to take advantage of opportunities to take unique pictures. 'I didn't even feel like setting up my camera that night, but I'm glad I made myself do it.' 'I didn't even look at the pictures for about a week.' 'Then I decided to upload them and have a look - and discovered the meteor.' 'The clip has gone crazy,' Wes wrote on his website. 'It was on the front page of Reddit and I've been hit up by licensing companies that work with National Geographic and the Discovery Channel. The video has since gone viral on Reddit and has been viewed over 500,000 times . 'I guess what was captured is a pretty rare occurrence.' Some Reddit users even commented that the object may be space junk, such as parts of a rocket or satellite. No matter what it is, the breathtaking video has been viewed over 500,000 times and was shot with a Canon 5D Mark ii camera and 16-35mm lens.","Wes Eisenhauer set up camera outside on a particularly clear night .

"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is coming out swinging on behalf of both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, insisting that neither should be second-guessed on their foreign policy records. The nanny-state pol, now a registered independent after years in both the Republicans and Democratic parties, said Clinton likely did all she could about the situation in Libya that led to the deaths of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. 'I think most of the criticisms of . Hillary are totally unfounded – you can maybe disagree with her . policies, but what'd you expect her to do in Benghazi?' he said in a recent interview. Bloomberg's backing comes as a new House committee is set to focus intensely on the Clinton-led State Department's failure to protect its Benghazi diplomatic compound in the months before armed terrorists laid waste to it, a congressional source told MailOnline on Monday. Former New York city mayor Michael Bloomberg is backing Hillary Clinton in her political life-or-death struggle with House Republicans over the deadly 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attack . The U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi erupted in flames during a terror attack by armed militants on September 11, 2012, just months after al-Qaeda-linked groups rallied in the city with dozens of military vehicles . Hillary Clinton (C) attended daughter Chelsea's graduate school commencement at Oxford University on Saturday, while a maelstrom of accusations awaits the former Secretary of State upon her return . 'I mean, it's that kind of cheap politics which I don’t like. She’s very competent,' Bloomberg told Politico of Republicans' tactics to date. Clinton has come under fire from Republicans for initially blaming the September 11, 2012 terror attack in the eastern Libya port city on a spontaneous protest allegedly sparked by a crude anti-Muslim video. Her statements immediately after the attack, and just weeks before Obama's re-election, were later proven false when intelligence reports and internal White House emails made it clear that the administration knew immediately that an al-Qaeda-linked Islamist terror group was responsible. But amid House Republicans' zeal to paint Clinton as a serial fabricator in advance of her decision on whether to run for president, they have asked few questions publicly about State Department policies and decisions before the attack took place. A 2014 Senate report concluded that the Benghazi terror strike was 'likely preventable' because State knew about security lapses and received several prior warnings about a deteriorating situation there. And evidence emerged in November that an al-Qaeda affiliate held a 2012 rally, parade and press conference in central Benghazi months before the 9/11 attack that year, and that the State Department was notified. At the event, terror leaders warned that 'assassinations' would follow. That same group, Ansar al-Shariah, led the September attack that killed four. In the five months before the deadly attack, the U.S. facility that would later fall was assaulted twice by armed militants. On April 6, 2012, two former security guards there threw IEDs over a fence at the compound. And on June 6 of that year terrorists detonated an explosive at the main perimeter gate, blowing a hole in it that a whistle-blower later told Congress was 'big enough for forty men to go through.' Republicans' strategy is set to change with the seating of a new select committee in . the House of Representatives charged solely with investigating the . terror attack. 'Believe . me, the committee will be less concerned with how the administration . spun what happened than with why it happened in the first place,' an . aide to a Republican member of that committee told MailOnline on Monday. Ansar al-Shariah openly holds rallies, marches and news conferences in the Middle East, often boasting that they hold power in cities where police presences are nonexistent and government control is weak . Ansar al-Shariah, the group behind the Benghazi attack, frequently holds rallies in Northern Africa like this one in Tunisia. The State Dept. knew a similar event happened in Benghazi in June 2012 but did nothing to beef up security . South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy (C) is chairing a new House panel on Benghazi, a committee that expects to focus intensely on why the State Department ignored warnings about the deteriorating security situation at its diplomatic post in Benghazi . The aide requested anonymity since he is not authorized to speak publicly about the committee's plans. That posture will likely dredge up the less-incendiary questions about why the Clinton-led State Department denied multiple requests for added security forces at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, and at a nearby CIA annex facility. Clinton addressed the GOP's investigative forward motion last week, telling a New York City audience that 'I do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in this way, but they get to call the shots in the Congress.' On Fox News Sunday, committee chair Rep. Trey Gowdy suggested Clinton was derelict for not pulling diplomats out of Benghazi after every other Western nation had done so. 'Why were we still in Benghazi?' he asked. 'The British ambassador was almost assassinated. Our facility was attacked twice. There were multiple episodes of violence. We were the last flag flying in Benghazi and I would like to know why.'","The former mayor accused House Republicans of 'cheap politics' for questioning Clinton's actions before and after the 2012 terror attack .
An aide to a member of the new House Select Committee on Benghazi says it will probe Clinton's failure to heed security warnings before the attack .
The focus on the former secretary of state comes as she is the Democrats' undeniable presidential front-runner .
The State Department had numerous warnings, including knowledge of a terrorist rally and parade in Benghazi months before the attack .

Undercover reporters, posing as the mother and brother of a 14-year-old, contacted 56 mosques  across the country and asked clerics to perform an Islamic marriage ceremony, known as a nika. Imams at 18 mosques agreed – including one who has advised the police. The preacher was prepared to arrange the nika despite being told that the ‘bride’ was being forced to move in with a man against her wishes. Scroll down for video . Exposed: Khan Misbahi, preacher at Jamia Masjid Kanzul Imam Mosque near Leeds agreed to marry the pair . The revelations will raise questions about how prevalent underage marriage is in Britain. Campaigners claim thousands of girls are forced into the illegal ceremonies every year, in a boom fuelled by the ‘moral blindness of cultural sensitivity’. Such weddings are not recognised by UK law. Marriages can only be officially registered if both parties are over 16, which is also the age of sexual consent. However, under Islamic or sharia law, a girl can get married as soon as she reaches puberty. One imam openly mocked English laws while speaking to reporters from ITV’s Exposure programme. When told the girl did not want to get married, Mohammed Shahid Akhtar, of the Central Jamia Mosque Ghamkol Sharif in Birmingham, replied: ‘She’s 14. By sharia, grace of God, she’s legal to get married. ‘Obviously Islam has made it easy for us. There is nothing against that. We’re doing it because it’s OK through Islam.’ ITV's Exposure undercover reporter posing as the mother of the girl. She visited 56 mosques and 18 agreed . 'We're doing it because it's OK through Islam' - Mohammed Shahid Akhtar, a cleric in Birmingham . He then revealed his contempt for English laws on marriage, referring to sharia law which allows men to have up to four wives. ‘You’ve got the kaffirs [non-believers], the law, the English people that ... you know, you can’t get married twice but, by the grace of god, we can get married four times,’ he said. Akhtar’s Birmingham mosque – one of the UK’s largest with a capacity of 6,000 – has suspended him pending an investigation. It denies that any underage marriages have been carried out there. Another cleric, Shams-ul-Huda Khan Misbahi, who preaches in Heckmondwike near Leeds, assured reporters that the marriage would be ‘real’.  Despite being told that the girl had only met her future husband once, the cleric condoned making her move in with the man against her wishes, claiming ‘everything is jaiz’, meaning lawful. Misbahi, who has previously spoken out against forced marriage and advised West Yorkshire police on community outreach, admitted that he would not be able to attain a UK wedding certificate, but added:  ‘We’ll make everything OK by Islam. We’ll write their names down and put it in our records.’ The Jamia Masjid Kanzul Iman mosque said it had launched a ‘thorough investigation’ into his comments. Angry: Assistant Secretary-General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, here with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, blasted the schemes. He said: 'In this country, it is illegal, it is forbidden and no imam should be allowed to conduct the marriage of an underage child' ‘This organisation does not condone forced or underage marriages,’ it said in a statement. Two other imams, at mosques in Manchester and Birmingham, are also under investigation after they were caught on camera agreeing to hold the ceremonies. The Muslim Council of Britain’s Ibrahim Mogra said: ‘UK law does not allow the marriage of underage girls and that’s all that matters to us here. In this country, it is illegal, it is forbidden and no imam should be allowed to conduct the marriage of an underage child.’ The charity Karma Nirvana, which supports forced marriage victims, says it has helped with girls as young as eight. It receives more than 600 calls every month. Founder Jasvinder Sanghera  told the Sunday Times that the issue had become ‘wrapped up in this moral blindness of cultural sensitivity’. Since 2008, courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been able to issue civil orders to prevent forced marriage. Breaches can result in a two-year prison sentence for contempt of court.","Imams at 18 British mosques agreed to marry a 14-year-old girl .

"Dr Nathalie MacDermott, is preparing to return to Liberia to help treat Ebola victims, after a fearing she contracted the disease on a fortnight placement . A doctor who feared she had contracted Ebola while working in Liberia treating victims is today preparing to return to the disease-ravaged country. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from Cardiff, confined herself to her flat for three weeks after returning from West Africa. But having been given the all-clear, the 32-year-old said she cannot sit and watch people dying without trying to help. Dr MacDermott spent two weeks in Liberia with relief organisation Samaritan's Purse earlier this summer. During that time she watched as two colleagues, Americans Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol fell ill with the deadly virus. She helped nurse the pair before they were flown home for life-saving treatment. Since then Ebola has claimed the lives of thousands more people, the World Health Organisation's current death toll standing at more than 3,800 people dead, and at least 8,000 infected. While the virus has spread to Europe, Spanish nurse Teresa Romero Ramos becoming the first person to contract the disease outside of West Africa, Dr MacDermott is set to return to the disease's epicentre. Reports from Liberia suggest the country's poor healthcare systems are buckling under the pressure, struggling to cope. Dr MacDermott told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales show: 'I think, unfortunately, things will be worse than when I was last there. 'When I was last there the epidemic was clearly spiralling out of control and we were overwhelmed in terms of the number of patients and the number of beds we had. 'But that situation is now far, far worse and patients are often being turned away from Ebola treatment units because there are not enough beds for them and some of them are dying outside the treatment units. 'I know that's the situation I'm going to right now.' The medic said she would find it difficult to turn away desperately ill patients. Dr MacDermott, pictured centre with colleagues in Liberia, treated more than 100 victims during her first stint . She said of the patients she treated only three survived, but fears the situation will be much worse this time . Dr MacDermott spent two weeks in Liberia with relief organisation Samaritan's Purse earlier this summer. Unable to sit back and watch as people die in the West African nation, the 32-year-old is preparing to return to Liberia where reports suggest the healthcare systems are buckling under the pressure .

When I was last there the epidemic was clearly spiralling out of control and we were overwhelmed in terms of the number of patients and the number of beds we had' Following her first trip, Dr MacDermott confined herself to her flat for 21 days to ensure she didn't have the virus, and risk passing it on. Pictured, a burial team in Liberia load a body bag into a waiting van . 'It's very difficult to turn away somebody who needs healthcare and say you can't offer it to them because there is no bed and know the outcome is likely that they will die,' she said. 'But at the same time we're battling a very large epidemic and we have to do the small things at the beginning and hope that eventually it will have a large impact.' On her first trip the medic, who was based at Swansea's Singleton Hospital but has now moved on as part of her training, saw only three of the roughly 100 patients she treated survive. Following advice from Public Health Wales, Dr MacDermott only kept in touch with friends and family via Skype after her return - and was even a virtual guest at a wedding. Dr MacDermott took over the day-to-day running of the centre in the capital, Monrovia, when Dr Brantly, 33, and 59-year-old Ms Writebol were isolated after developing the condition. Both were flown back to the United States for treatment and have since been cured, with Dr Brantly describing his return to health as 'miraculous'. In the latest incidents Madrid nurse Mrs Romero Ramos is the first person known to have contracted the deadly virus outside West Africa. Dr MacDermott worked at the same healthcare centre as Dr Kent Brantly, the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola. He was flown back to the US and has since survived, donating his blood to other victims . And aid worker Nancy Writebol, the second American to catch the virus, was also working at the centre. Dr MacDermott was forced to take over running the facility when her American colleagues fell ill, nursing them both before they were repatriated to the US . She had treated two Spanish missionaries who later died from Ebola. Her dog Excalibur was put down on Tuesday amid uncertainty over whether the animal was infected. Australian Red Cross volunteer Sue Ellen Kovack is being monitored for the condition after treating patients in Sierra Leone. Dr MacDermott said while she was concerned about contracting the condition herself she hoped she would be able to return to the UK for treatment if the worst happens.","Dr Nathalie MacDermott spent a fortnight in Liberia earlier this year .

Ten elephants produce the stunning floral and tree-inspired artworks unaided, with the only human influence being when the mahouts replenish the paint. The sanctuary's website states: 'Initially, the calves were reluctant to pick up a paint brush and it took more than a month of persistence before the would-be artists became adept at simply holding the brush in their trunks. 'The next step for the mahouts was to train them to actually put paint onto paper. 'One of our pachyderm prodigies successfully painted dots, while the other three chose to paint beautiful lines.' When completed, the paintings often have a floral motif or depict a colourful tree . It may be hard to believe, but these paintings sell for an average of £58 per piece .

"A couple suffered the holiday from hell after their coach trip crashed into a volcano leaving them with £16,000 medical bill. Paulina Guevara, 26, and Xavier Boyle, 25, spent £4,000 on a trip of a lifetime to Ecuador to visit Paulina's family when tragedy happened. Only 13 days into their holiday, they visited the 3,687 feet-high Sierra Negra volcano on Isabela Island in the Galapagos Islands when their coach's brakes failed. Xavier Boyle suffered a badly broken arm and dislocated elbow after he was trapped beneath the bus . The 'chiva' - a basic bus with no windows or doors - veered into the side of the volcano, sending Xavier, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, flying from the vehicle and trapping him beneath it. Xavier suffered a badly broken arm and dislocated elbow and Paulina suffered broken bones as she was flung towards the front of the vehicle. They were flown to a private hospital on the mainland, as a local hospital would have amputated his arm, and they were left with a whopping £16,000 bill. Paulina suffered from broken bones as a result of the accident on the Galapagos Islands . Xavier suffered from a broken arm and a dislocated elbow in the accident after he was flung from the bus . Xavier said: 'It was the stuff of nightmares - when I was trapped under the bus I thought I was a goner. 'I said goodbye to Paulina as I thought I wasn't going to get out from under the bus. 'I couldn't feel or move my legs at first and just thought I wouldn't be able to walk again. 'It sounds stupid to say but we were lucky we hit the mountain. 'If we had veered the other way we'd have fallen down a steep precipice and we'd have had no chance.' Xavier and Paulina had saved up for three years to pay for the three-month-long £4,000 holiday as she had not returned home to Ecuador since arriving in the UK 12 years ago. Xavier's brother Dominic had to have surgery on his hand, and right, Xavier preparing to be assessed . They made the 14-hour journey with Xavier's mum, Teresa Houston, and brother, Dominic, on September 13 and weren't due back until December. On September 27, they made the trip to Sierra Negra through the Coral Blanco hotel, where they were staying, and were making their descent when tragedy struck. After being pinned between the bus and the ground, Xavier had to wait until all the other passengers had got off before using his good arm to dig himself out. Their tour guide was unable to call emergency services as his phone was out of charge so someone was sent on foot to the nearest town for help, but it was miles away. A tourist who had heard the accident reported on the radio drove to the scene in a pick-up truck and took the injured to the island's clinic where Xavier's arms was put in a makeshift splint. The Sierra Negra volcan, but on the journey to the spectacular site a bus crash left Paulina Guevara  and Xavier Boyle with injuries and subsequently huge medical bills . After 24 hours the group was flown to the only hospital on the islands. Xavier said: 'They had an A&E and it was more of a hospital but it was still poorly equipped, very dirty and basic. 'Finally after battling with the local authorities for two days, we managed to get off the islands to the mainland. 'We were eventually taken in a cargo plane to a private hospital on the mainland. 'We knew the hospital would be expensive but it was either that or have my arm amputated. 'We didn't have any insurance but it was a no-brainer - we had to do it.' Xavier suffered a broken collar bone, shoulder blade and arm and also dislocated his elbow. Paulina also suffered a broken collar bone and nose, while Dominic lost two teeth and all the skin on one of his hands. Xavier was told he should return to the UK for treatment on his arm as soon as possible, but said he was told he couldn't leave the hospital until he paid his medical fees of around US $25,000 (about £16,000) in cash. A trip to the Sierra Negra volcano on Isabela Island in the Galapagos Islands turned sour for the couple . Paulina, Xavier and his family say they gave the hospital everything they could, but it took five weeks to raise the total and they say they were effectively imprisoned. Xavier's dad transferred the remaining money over to Paulina's aunt, Elena Mendez. The couple finally returned to the UK on October 26, but have been told they will have to return to the Galapagos Islands to try and recover their medical costs through their legal system. Xavier said: 'That's completely out of the question. 'After our experience she doesn't want to go back to Ecuador - her home. 'We were told before we left that the department of tourism would help us out. 'But we haven't had any reply since we got back to this country - we're stuck.' A statement from the Department of Tourism in Ecuador said: 'On September 26 the unfortunate accident happened where the coach suffered a mechanical failure causing it to overturn, meaning the tourists travelling were injured. 'They were immediately rescued and taken to a local hospital. 'However, the severity of Xavier and Paulina's injuries meant they were sent immediately by helicopter to the Hospital Oskar Jandl in San Cristobal on the mainland. 'The next day, they were transferred to Guayaquil. 'The Ministry has been in constant communication with the injured tourists and the British Embassy in Quito. 'Within the framework of its powers and jurisdiction, the Ministry has proceeded to suspend the Tourist Operator Sierra Negra Expeditions and Ecotourism in Isabela. 'Suspension continues until the present date and Travel Agency Cabomartur in Santa Cruz was fined $5,000 more than the regulations. 'As Ministry of Tourism we have acted with the full force of the law against these two tourist establishments.

"An American college student who went missing while studying abroad in Rome was killed by a train. Bates College junior John Durkin, 21, was last seen by friends at about 2.30am on Thursday, at a bar called Sloppy Sam’s. Family members had flown from Rye, in New Hampshire, to Italy to help with the search, but his body was spotted in a tunnel by a passenger on a train on Thursday. Gone too soon: John Durkin died at only 21-years-old while studying abroad in Rome . Missing: John Durkin was last seen at Sloppy Sam's, a bar in Rome's Camp de Fiore neighborhood . Durkin's body was removed from the tunnel, which runs under a large park between the Vatican and  Trastevere neighborhood in Rome, by Italian authorities, CBS News reported. Italian railway authorities confirmed on Saturday that he had been been killed by a train. A statement from his university president, Clayton Spencer, said: 'This is a time of deep sadness for our community and for so many people who knew and loved John. 'We are profoundly sad and share the tremendous grief of his family.' Bates head football coach Mark Harriman added:'John’s commitment to excellence in all phases of his life was inspirational to the other members of the squad and a major factor in the team’s success over the past three years. 'We will remember the fortitude and character that John displayed on a daily basis and attempt to emulate those standards.' Durkin had been in Rome for just over a month while studying abroad for the spring semester, and was last seen with friends at the bar in Rome's Camp de Fiore neighborhood. He had stayed behind after they went home, according to WBZ. Witnesses said the college football player left not long after, but he never made it back to his dorm room, according to a family friend who spoke to the station. ‘They were out at a bar called Sloppy Sam’s which is in sort of a collegiate area,’ Spence Lockhart said. ‘He stayed on a little bit later. They had gone back to their dormitories and he stayed on and that’s the last time they saw him.’ Loss: The university John Durkin was a student at paid tribute to the promising young man . Tragic: Family members flew to Rome to help search for John but his body was discovered in a tunnel . He had since virtually disappeared off the grid, and now his family knows why. ‘There’s no cell phone. There’s no activity. There’s no activity on his credit cards, nothing that would indicate he’s traveling outside the area,’ Lockhart added. ’That’s why we’re so concerned.’ Joining Lockhart and the Durkin family in that concern were Italian authorities, the US Embassy in Rome and even the FBI, all of whom were working together to find the missing economics major. Lockhart shared his optimism Durkin would be found alive less than 24 hours before authorities made the sobering find. 'I can't think of a nicer young man, Lockhart told WTMW. 'This is something that is very scary, but we certainly feel like we are going to bring him home safe.' Officials still have yet to flesh out the exact details surrounding Durkin’s disappearance. The study abroad program was administered through Trinity College, in Hartford, Connecticut. Popular: The bar where Durkin was last seen is in a college area often frequented by American students . A Bates statement said the two schools are working with both Italian and American officials. ‘This situation is deeply distressing for John’s family, his fellow students and the entire Bates community,’ the college said. ‘We are working actively with Trinity College to monitor events as they evolve, and we will share information as it becomes available.’ The family had set up a Twitter account to help in the search, it already has nearly 1,100 followers. A MailOnline request left with family for further comment has not yet been returned.","John Durkin, 21, had not been heard from since 2.30am on Thursday .

"Families of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight have expressed mixed feelings over whether the new data released shows that authorities are on the right path to finding the missing plane. Australian Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul had just started a new fly-in fly-out job in Mongolia when he went missing aboard MH370, is a spokesperson for Voice 370, a committee set up to represent families of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the plane. This group put the pressure on Malaysia Airlines to release the raw satellite data, and Weeks told the Sydney Morning Herald a that the move was a 'step towards transparency', but 'we are not sure why they held onto it for so long.' Scroll down for video . Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was aboard missing plane MH370 says releasing the data was a move towards transparency . 'There does not seem to be anything in there that would have held back its release. We are grappling with completely changed lives and...trying to fight to get transparency at the same time. We have been through enough,' she said. But the data has left their families bewildered and they have complained that the report is missing data, as well as comparable records from previous . flights on MH370's route that the families had requested. Weeks also said that the Voice 370 would welcome anyone who can help them interpret the data and give feedback to the group. The data from satellite communications with the plane, which runs to 47 pages in a report prepared by Inmarsat, features hourly 'handshakes' - or network log-on confirmations - after the aircraft disappeared from civilian radar screens on March 8. Malaysia's acting transport minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein announced the data that helped track MH370 (pictured) will be released to the public tomorrow . Families of passengers are hoping that opening up the data to analysis by a wider range of experts can help verify the plane's last location, nearly three months after the Boeing 777 with 239 passengers and crew disappeared. 'When . we first asked for the data it was more than two months ago. I never . dreamed it would be such an obstacle to overcome,' Sarah Bajc, the . American partner of a passenger, said from Beijing. Bajc . said experts on flight tracking who have been advising the families . would now be able to analyse the data to see if the search area could be . refined and determine if Inmarsat and other officials had missed . anything. But . she complained the report released on Tuesday was missing data removed . to improve readability, as well as comparable records from previous . flights on MH370's route that the families had requested. 'Why couldn't they have submitted that?' she said. 'It only makes sense if they are hiding something.' The Inmarsat control room. The British satellite firm's data, which contains signals sent by MH370 will be reanalyzed . The data's . release had become a rallying cry for many of the families, who have . accused the Malaysian government of holding back information. Based . on Inmarsat's and other investigators' analysis of the data, the . aircraft is believed to have gone down in the Indian Ocean, off western . Australia. Malaysian . investigators suspect someone shut off MH370's data links making the . plane impossible to track, but investigators have so far turned up . nothing suspicious about the crew or passengers. In . the hours after the aircraft disappeared, an Inmarsat satellite picked . up a handful of handshake 'pings', indicating the plane continued flying . for hours after leaving radar and helping narrow the search to an area . of the Indian Ocean. The . dense technical data released on Tuesday details satellite . communications from before MH370's take-off on a Saturday morning at . 12.41am local time (4.41pm GMT) to a final, 'partial handshake' transmitted by the plane at 8.19am (12.19am GMT). Unprecedented: Twenty-six nations have been involved in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 since it disappeared . The data includes a final transmission from the plane 8 seconds later, after which there was no further response. The . data also featured two 'telephony calls' initiated from the ground at 6.39pm GMT and 11.13pm GMT that went unanswered by the plane. Malaysian officials were not immediately available to answer questions on the data. Calculations . based on the pings and the plane's speed showed the jetliner likely . went down in the remote ocean seven to eight hours after its normal . communications were apparently cut off as it headed to Beijing on its . routine flight. The time of the last satellite contact was consistent . with the plane's fuel capacity. The . search in an area around 1,550 km (960 miles) northwest of Perth was . further narrowed on the basis of acoustic signals believed to have come . from the aircraft's 'black box' data recorders before their batteries . ran out. After . the most extensive search in aviation history failed to turn up any . trace of the plane, however, officials have said that it could take a . year to search the 60,000 sq km (23,000 sq mile) area where it could . have come down. Malaysia, . China and Australia said in mid-May they had agreed to re-examine all . data related to the missing plane to better determine the search area as . the hunt enters a new, deep-sea phase.

"Pet cats are being infected by tuberculosis and could pass the disease on to the owners, vets say . Cats could pass on deadly bovine tuberculosis to their owners, according to vets. Adventurous felines are catching the disease during their exploration of badger setts or by coming into contact with rodents who have done the same. They can also pick up bovine TB directly from cattle or infected milk. Now experts says vets should be more aware that domestic cats can carry the disease. 'The real issue with cats with TB is . that unless they are feral, they tend to have close contact with . humans,' Carl Padgett, former president of the British Veterinary . Association, told the Sunday Telegraph. 'That is . where you ramp up a degree of the public health risk through direct . contact with cats that have TB and that is where I see the importance . rather than driving the outbreak among cattle.' Scientists at the University of Edinburgh Royal School of Veterinary Studies say that as many as 100 out of every 100,000 cats could have a form of tuberculosis, more than previously thought. A fifth of those are thought to be infected by Mycobacterium bovis - the strain found in cattle and badgers. Most were caused by Mycobacterium microti, usually found in voles. Professor Danielle Gunn-Moore, who led the study, told the newspaper: 'You need to be aware that cats are acting as . sentinels for other small furries that are infected. 'You might clear the . cattle, but if you don’t clear the cats as well, you could potentially . get reinfection.' The Edinburgh team found that, in one year, 17 per cent of the 187 reported cases of TB in cats were caused by the bovine strain. Their findings have been published in the journal of Transboundary and Emerging Diseases. Government figures show that only 80 cases of bovine TB in cats have been reported to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs since 2009, with nine of those reported last year. Mr Padgett welcomed the Edinburgh findings and said the low number of cases was likely to be caused by vets being unaware that they should look out for feline tuberculosis. But he also told the Sunday Telegraph that there was no suggestion that cats are the main spreader of TB and said the pets do not pose a major health risk to humans. Chief veterinary officer Nigel . Gibbens told BBC Radio 4’s Farming Today: '[Cats] roam and do explore . and could get into fights with feral cats and badgers themselves. Cats could pick up Mycobacterium bovis from badger setts, rodents that have been in badger setts or with fights with badgers themselves . 'There . is a threat to humans. If an animal has an unresolving bite wound or a . respiratory problem that won’t go away, they should talk to their vets, . and vets need to bear this in mind. 'Transmission to people is possible . and has happened but the number of cases in pets is low and so the . possibility of this is low.' Between 1994 and 2011 there were 570 cases of bovine tuberculosis in humans. Those with the cattle strain of the illness were mainly over the age of 65 and had drunk infected unpasteurised milk. Less than 1 per cent of the 8,963 human cases of TB in 2011 were caused by Mycobacterium bovis. About 5,000 badgers are due to be culled in Somerset and Gloucestershire before the end of the year because authorities say they spread tuberculosis among cattle. Badgers are blamed for spreading the disease to livestock, devastating herds and costing dairy farmers and the taxpayer millions of pounds a year. Ministers say that unless everything possible is done to control the disease, the bill to the country will top £1billion over the next decade. But critics favour other methods, including vaccination, and say that the science behind the cull is not sound.","As many as 100 out of every 100,000 cats carry tuberculosis, experts say .

"A stunning set of photographs taken by famed African-American photographer Gordon Parks during segregation in the 1950s are set to go on display later this month. The collection, called The Restraints: Open and Hidden, follows the lives of three families living in and around downtown Mobile, Alabama in 1956, and show how they went about their daily routine in a town separated by race with children at their side. Rediscovered in 2012, six years after he died of cancer at the age of 93, these photos will be shown at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia beginning this Saturday. Scroll down for video .

Parks followed three families – the Thorntons, the Causeys and the Tanners – in their work, home and church lives near Mobile according to The Guardian. Only 20 of the photographs ran in the original photo-essay, but 50 additional color transparencies were found in 2012. Of these 40 will be on display. He would later go on to shoot famous subjects including Malcolm X, Barbara Streissand and Muhammad Ali for Life, working with the magazine for 20 years. He also became one of the first African-Americans to ever shoot for Vogue. Later in life he would go on to direct films, famously helming the classic Shaft two years after making his directorial debut with The Learning Tree in 1969,based upon his semi-autobiographical novel of growing up in Kansas in the 1920s. He would continue to write until his death, and also co-founded the popular magazine Essence.

"A 15-year-old girl who was bullied by classmates for years has killed herself after naming her tormenters in a suicide note and telling them: 'Thanks for all the pain.' Cora Delille's body was found by a family member at their home in Pickerington, Ohio on May 10 after she hanged herself, Commander Matt Delp of Pickerington Police said. She left an emotional note giving a 'myriad of reasons' why she took her life, including classmates calling her names and feeling abandoned by her father and stepfather, he told MailOnline. 'There were complex issues,' Delp . explained. 'She wrote about her home life and feeling unloved. Her . mother and stepfather - the father she had known for 14 years - were . getting a divorce. Her boyfriend had broken up with her the day before. There were many reasons.' Tragic: Cora Delille, 15, hanged herself on May 10 after enduring years of bullying, her friends have said . 'Complex': Police said that Cora was also unhappy at home because her mother and stepfather were in the process of a divorce, and that she and her boyfriend had broken up the day before she took her life . She also named at least four fellow students, including girls and two ex-boyfriends, and said they had caused her pain, he said. Following . news of her death, friends confirmed to police that Cora had been the . victim of bullying and name calling at school and on social media. Authorities . interviewed the four students who were named in the letter, but did not . find any conduct worthy of prosecution, he said. There was also no . evidence of bullying on social networks, he added. 'She . was the victim of some name calling,' he explained. 'While it's . troublesome, it doesn't warrant bringing charges against the students.' Loved: Friends have paid tribute to her online, but bullies have also posted cruel messages on her pictures . Still trolled after death: A bully wrote the message '#f***cora' and called her a 'b****' on Instagram . Close friends said that Cora mostly kept the torment to herself, and her parents said they had no idea the extent to which she was suffering. 'She mentioned here and there when kids made fun of her,' her mother, Amy Hall, told the Columbus Dispatch. 'She didn't clue me in to how bad it was.' Friends said that students would make passing digs at her in the hallways at school and at lunch, while others said they heard girls calling Cora names at the spring dance recently. The day before she killed herself, she phoned her best friend Sydney Teal in tears. 'She said she couldn’t take much more,' Sydney told the Dispatch. 'I didn't know what to do. I told her I loved her and . that I'm here for her.' Since her death, a friend has heard a student at school say she was happy that Cora was dead, while bullies have also cropped up online, writing insulting words beneath her photographs. Scene: Friends said that students at Ridgeview Junior High, pictured, would call Cora names and one student said she was glad the teen was dead. School officials said the bullying was never reported . School officials added that Cora had never reported any bullying. 'I've yet to work with anyone who is going to ignore outright bullying when it's taking place,' Superintendent Rob Walker told the Dispatch. 'Can it happen and the teacher not hear it? Yes.' Her mother, who remembered her daughter as fun-loving and a caring big sister to her younger siblings, hopes that other teenagers will get help before it's too late. 'A lot of other kids are suffering,' her . mother said. 'They need to know there are other people out there to . help. They don’t need to keep it inside.' Cora's funeral, led by her grandfather Pastor Roger Epperson, was held on Wednesday. Commander Delp said the investigation into her death is now closed.

"A 24-year-old man whose body was found in the Missouri River behind Black Eagle Dam was featured in the 2006 HBO documentary 'Montana Meth' and was sober as recently as 2011. Toward the end of the film, the then 16-year-old Graham Macker is asked by his mother, 'How does it end?' Macker says, 'I don't know.' On Wednesday his body was found as PPL Montana workers broke up ice near the dam. Cascade County officials said he drowned. Macker was 16 when he appeared in the HBO documentary 'Montana Meth' in 2006 . 'Our condolences, thoughts and prayers go out to his family,' Amy Rue, executive director of the Montana Meth Project, told the Billings Gazette on Friday. 'Meth use continues to be a serious issue in our communities. It is a highly addictive substance that destroys lives.' On Nov. 14, Macker was reported as a walk-away from the pre-release center. It was suspected that he hid in vegetation along the south side of the Missouri River. Sheriff's deputies, Great Falls police dogs and a Homeland Security helicopter were unable to find Macker. There was no indication he went into the river that evening, authorities said. Macker had been sent to the pre-release center for probation violations relating to 2009 forgery and bad-check charges in Kalispell. 'He was a son, a brother and a wonderful friend to so many people,' Rue said. 'There is so much more to Graham than just this one experience.' In the documentary, Macker told filmmaker Eames Yates that he used to be an athletic kid. His drowned body was found in the Missouri River behind Black Eagle Dam . End: Authorities had to break up the ice to reach Macker's body in the area known as 'the pond' 'I'd run the mile, and now I run a block and I'm tired as hell,' he said. 'I have stretch marks on my back. I lost, like, 30 pounds.' He also lamented the money he spent on drugs. 'I could have so much stuff right now,' he said. 'Just the amounts of money I spend on drugs and people I owe.' While the documentary ended on a unresolved note, CBS Evening News caught up with Macker and his mother after the show in September 2011 - and Macker was sober at the time. 'We're doing a day at a time right now,' he said. 'At the rate I was doing, I would not still be here.' Rue said she was grateful Macker took part in the documentary and spoke about his troubles. Off the wagon: hen CBS followed-up Macker's story in 2011, he said he was sober but it appears he relapsed again. Mother Wendy Macker pictured on the right . 'Countless teens have learned as a result of learning his life story,' she said. The documentary, in addition to a ad campaign, have helped radically curb teen meth use in the state. Teen meth use went down 63 per cent after the ad campaign launched in 2005 . Man attribute the campaign and documentary's effectiveness to the non-preachy tone. 'It doesn't just tell you ""no don't do this."" It shows you why you don't do this,' said teen Emily Dean, who was in middle school when the ads started running. Montana is now ranked 39th in the nation for meth use, a dramatic fall from its previous ranking of 5th.

"Britain's only rumpologist - a person who reads people's bottoms - has appeared on live television to analyse the derrieres of celebrities including actress Kelly Brook and singer Rihanna. Sam Amos joined Holly Willoughby and Dermot O'Leary on ITV's This Morning today to explain how she learns about a person's character by examining their rears, in the same way a palm reader might better understand someone by looking at their hands. When asked what exactly she sees in a person's bottom, Amos said: 'It tells me about the character of a person, the good points and the bad points.' She then went on to predict big changes for Kelly Brook, including the possibility of a relocation to America and a new relationship. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sam Amos, left, appeared on This Morning to analyse celebrity bottoms, including that belonging to Kelly Brook, right, which was recently voted best in the world . This Morning presenters Holly Willoughby and Dermot O'Leary were confused by Sam Amos' revelations . She said: 'Kelly went through a big transition last year. A painful one. And I think she's now ready for a new romance in her life.' Looking at the photograph of Kelly, Holly quickly interjected with: 'What told you that? Google?' Amos replied: 'No, it's the right cheek that was telling me all the past things, the . left cheek tells all the future things. It's telling me she might go to . America and even settle down there.' Moving on to a photograph of Rihanna's posterior, Amos said: 'Well, she's quite a feisty lady, and I would say a perfectionist. 'I . would say she's quite happy as well, and also that she'll get broody . soon because one of her friends is going to have a baby girl. I would . also say she's going to do more charity work, which will change her . life in some way.' Sam Amos talks Holly and Dermot through rumpology while looking at the bottom belonging to the first volunteer . Volunteer one was Souli Roots from X Factor, who was told her bottom made her seem fun and not too serious . Holly and Dermot then asked Amos to read three mystery celebrity that were protruding through three holes in a wall. About the first one she said: 'This person is very outgoing, has gone thjrough a transition as well, i8s very creative and very fun to be around. They can be a bit serious at times, but not too serious.' Holly quickly added: 'Well, she is on national television with her bottom poked through a hole, so she can't be that serious. The volunteer turned out to be X Factor contestent Souli Roots, who said Amos was spot-on. TOWIE's Bobby - who is a Gok Wan lookalike - was the second mystery bottom . Celebrity transsexual Lauren Harries appeared in front of the screen as the third mystery bottom . Reading the second volunteer's rear, Amos said: 'This person likes tattoos for special occasions and likes to be outside a lot. I get that from the left cheek. I'm not sure if they're a presenter or a comedian. I get that fun to be around thing.' The volunteer was revealed as TOWIE 'Gok Wannabe' Bobby Cole Norris, who was moderately impressed but said he really preferred hotels to being outside. When it came to the third one, Amos said: 'I'm a bit all over the place with this one. I think they're going through quite an emotional time. They like to be in control, they are a bit of comedian, they like to play pranks on people.' When celebrity transsexual Lauren Harries stepped out from behind the wall she agreed that she did like to be in control but was not really a prankster. Jackie Stallone does rump readings . Sylvester Stallone's mother Jacqueline, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, is one of America's foremost rumpologists. She believes that rump reading is an art that was practiced in ancient Babylon, India, Greece, and Rome, considering the rear to be the key to health and fidelity, and what determined potential talents and future success. 'Rumpology is the art of reading the lines, crevices, dimples, and folds of the buttocks to divine the individual's character and gain an understanding of what has occurred in the past and get a prediction of the future.' Jacqueline has discovered that the left and right cheeks reveal a person's past and future, respectively. The right buttocks represents the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain, while the left buttocks represents the right hemisphere. It is similar to palmistry -- where the left palm  represents the past and the right palm represents the future. A rump report from Jacqueline Stallone can tell you whether you are going ""ass-backwards"" or eyes open into the future.

"A startling video has emerged showing Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson unleashing another homophobic rant - just months after the TV show's network suspended him for a similar tirade. Robertson was filmed giving an Easter Sunday sermon at Whites Ferry Road Church in his hometown of West Monroe, Louisiana on April 20, according to the video on YouTube. In the footage, the 68-year-old expresses his anger at the outcry over his December interview in GQ magazine, in which he likened homosexuality to bestiality and branded gay people sinners. 'They were mad at me,' he tells the congregation in the video. 'You . say, ""why'd they get mad at you?"" Cuz instead of . acknowledging their sin, like you had better do, they railed against me . for giving them the truth about their sins. Don't deceive yourselves.' Scroll down for video . Rant: In an Easter Sunday sermon at his Louisiana church, Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson complained about the outrage against him following his homophobic comments last year . He went on: 'The news media didn’t even know it was a verse! They thought I . was just mouthing off. ""Is homosexual behavior a sin?"" The guy asked me. I . said, ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of . God? Don't be deceived"".' Paraphrasing a Corinthians verse, he continued: 'Neither the sexually immoral, nor the . idolators nor adulterers nor male prostitutes, nor homosexual offenders, . nor thieves, nor greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will . inherit the kingdom of God.' 'That list of sins covered me in my past life,' he said. 'We've all been there. The reason we're here today is to remind us of the gospel that's preached.' His rant is met by scattered applause and cheers from the congregation. It comes just five months after Robertson, a born-again Christian, gave the controversial GQ interview. Tirade: The congregation claps as he repeats that gay people - as well as thieves and cheaters - are sinners . 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. 'Bestiality, sleeping around with this . woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the . adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual . offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - . they won't inherit the kingdom of God.' His homophobic comments also included such insights as: 'It seems like, to me, . a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man's anus. 'That's . just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She's got more to . offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: . It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical.' He also grouped . homosexuals with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone . on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love . 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, . drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm . saying?' After the interview emerged, Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus from Duck Dynasty. In hot water: Robertson, 68, was briefly suspended from Duck Dynasty last December following an interview . While his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations, fans of the . show denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech. Conservative supporters included . Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free speech is an endangered . species. Those intolerants' hatin' and taking on the Duck Dynasty . patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.' A&E initially said his views were 'disappointing' but two weeks later, they announced that Robertson would be included when they began filming again in the new year. 'After . discussions with the Robertson family, as well as consulting with . numerous advocacy groups, A&E has decided to resume filming Duck . Dynasty later this spring with the entire Robertson family,' the network . said in a statement. Uncertain future: Duck Dynasty (the cast is pictured) has seen lower ratings since the tirade last year . Robertson also released a public apology saying, in part: 'I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. 'We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.' Whether or not this latest rant will affect his position on the show - which has suffered falling ratings since the first tirade - has yet to be seen. The show is scheduled to begin its sixth . season on June 11.","Robertson, 68, was briefly suspended from the show by A&E last year after he likened homosexuality to bestiality in GQ interview .

"A femme fatale who divided a Czech community by sleeping with Nazi soldiers to give them STDs has had a plaque erected in her memory. Locals in the south Bohemian town of Trebon said the nurse, who worked in a local hospital, decided to get revenge on the Nazi invaders after she was raped shortly after the occupation in 1938. Former lawyer Karel Friml, 79, now lives in the woman's house and is behind the move to have her memory recognised. Scroll down for video . Lest we forget: The plaque which a retired lawyer has erected on his house to commemorate a femme fatale who divided a Czech community by sleeping with Nazi soldiers to give them STDs . He said: 'Unfortunately, we don't know her exact name because time and memories have failed to preserve it. 'But we know that she was assigned to look after wounded German soldiers and began affairs with them.' At first the mystery nurse was shunned and branded a whore by locals, but when the soldiers began either disappearing or dying, Mr Friml says it became known that she was deliberately infecting them. 'This was her resistance and vengeance for the rape of her country and her personal rape,' he said. 'She had many German lovers, maybe six, maybe ten, maybe more. 'People say that all of them disappeared after the affair with her.' Resistance: Locals in the south Bohemian town of Trebon said the nurse, who worked in a local hospital, decided to get revenge on the Nazi invaders after she was raped shortly after the occupation 1938 . German troops rolled into Trebon right at the start of the Second World War, after the Nazis had already annexed various partly German-speaking regions of what was then Czechoslovakia - known as the Sudetenland - a year earlier. By proclamation of Adolf Hitler, the entire western half of the country - the Czech side - was renamed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. While their government continued its formal existence, the Czechs' Nazi rulers quickly set about mobilising the population for labour to aid the German war effort. The Gestapo meanwhile set about dismantling the Czech intelligentsia and middle class according to a plan to eventually eradicate the Czech national identity through assimilation and deportation. It was the Gestapo who eventually got to Trebon's mystery nurse, after they sent an agent to find out what was happening to their soldiers in the town. Mr Friml said: 'The Gestapo noticed that these people were disappearing and sent a secret agent to the hospital, . 'He uncovered what she was up to and had her shot.' Hitler in Prague in 1939: By proclamation of Adolf Hitler, the entire western half of Czechoslovakia was renamed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and was directly ruled by German officials . Regional historian and curator of the museum in Trebon Jirina Psikova said: 'The woman is historically unrecognised with no known documents mentioning her, but several people remember her story and opinion is divided. 'Some say she was a slut and spread sexually transmitted diseases among German officers; others say she was a real patriot who was raped and infected by the Nazis and she decided to get her revenge.' But Mr Friml is clear what he thinks. 'I am really sorry that she died anonymously, I think she was a hero. 'And that's why we have made this memorial plaque to her and placed it on the wall of the house.'","An ex-lawyer who now lives in unnamed woman's house campaigned to set up the memorial .

"Jailbird: Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, pictured in her booking after being charged with failure to identify stemming from a jaywalking incident . The chief of police in Austin, Texas, addressed the controversial video showing a young jogger being arrested for jaywalking, insisting that his officers have done nothing wrong. In a press conference held Saturday, a defiant Chief Art Acevedo came out swinging against the critics of his department and refused to apologize for the arrest of 24-year-old Amanda Jo Stephen. Stephen was taken into custody while out for a run on 24th Street Thursday morning after she illegally crossed the street and then allegedly refused to give her name to police officers. Stephen's dramatic arrest marked by sobbing and yelling was captured by a bystander, Chris Quintero, whose video went viral after being posted on YouTube. On Saturday, a visibly irritated Chief Acevedo downplayed the entire incident and brushed off words of censure directed at his officers by social media users. ‘Thank you, lord, that it is a controversy in Austin, Texas — that we actually have the audacity to touch somebody by the arm and tell them, “Oh my goodness, Austin police we’re trying to get your attention,”’ Acevedo remarked sarcastically. ‘Whew! In other cities, cops are actually committing sexual assaults on duty, so I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in Austin, Texas.’ Scroll down for videos . She had it coming: Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo responded to the controversy surrounding the jogger's arrest, saying that Stephen was uncooperative and left officers no choice but to grab her hand and cuff her . Sarcastic: Chief Acevedo told reporters he thanks God that a jaywalker's arrest passes for controversy in Austin, while elsewhere in the country cops commit serious crimes on duty . Combative mood: Acevedo insisted that his officers have done nothing wrong, and that Stephen should consider herself lucky that she wasn't slapped with a charge of resisting arrest . The chief explained that two uniformed officers screamed at Stephen to stop, but the woman, who allegedly didn't hear them because she had her headphone on, continued on her way. Only then, Acevedo said, did one of the cops grab her arm from behind. The chief also challenged the claim that the woman couldn't hear the cops because of the pink earbuds seen in photos of her arrest. According to police, the 24-year-old runner refused to divulge her name and was uncooperative. Quintero, who wrote a post of his blog lambasting police for startling the woman, later toned down his rhetoric, telling the station KTBC that even if the officer came up from behind, at some point Stephen must have realized that he was a law enforcement agent. While it was suggested earlier that the woman was dragged to the ground after being handcuffed, Acevedo revealed that Stephen sat down on her own accord and went limp, the Austin American Statesman reported. ‘She did the limp routine, and in 28 years of law enforcement, I can tell you it happens all the time,’ Acevedo said. Austin’s top cop added that the 24-year-old should consider herself lucky that he was not among the officers on the scene, who let her walk away with a failure to identify charge rather than the more serious count of resisting arrest. ‘I wouldn’t have been as generous,’ he warned. Stephen was one of 28 people who were stopped for jaywalking Thursday. A total of seven pedestrians were issued citations. Stephen's headline-making arrest took place just before 11am outside a fast-food eatery near the intersection of 24th Street and San Antonio Street in Austin. Busted: Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, is seen handcuffed and in tears following Thursday's arrest for a traffic violation in Austin . Caught on camera: Chris Quintero took pictures and video of the jogger's arrest; the college student said the 24-year-old crossed the street without waiting to the light to switch and was ordered to stop by police . Sporting a black crop top, shorts and toe sneakers, 24-year-old Amanda Jo Stephen was running across the street when an officer yelled for her to stop. According to Quintero, who saw the arrest play out from a nearby Starbucks, the jogger got caught in a police operation targeting jaywalkers, University of Texas' student newspaper The Daily Texan reported. Since Stephen had her headphones on, she allegedly didn't hear the officer and continued on her way. The officer quickly caught up with her and grabbed Stephen’s hand from behind, prompting her to push his hand away. Desperate pleas: A sobbing Stephen repeatedly told the officers that she did nothing wrong and was simply exercising . Lawbreaker: Austin PD said the woman has been charged with failure to identify herself to police and a class B traffic signal violation . An Austin police spokesperson told MailOnline Friday that Miss Stephen was handcuffed and taken into custody for failing to give her name to police. In Quintero's 2-minute video, the young woman with blond hair arranged in two braids in seen weeping on the ground with her hands restrained behind her back and two officers towering over her. At one point, the apprehended jogger notices Quintero taking pictures of her and declares: 'I was doing nothing wrong. I was crossing the street.' A moment later, a pair of uniformed cops, joined by two more cops on bikes, could be seen placing the sobbing woman into the back of a squad car, with her pleading and shrieking at the top of her lungs. ‘I didn’t do anything wrong! I didn’t do anything wrong! she said repeatedly. ‘I didn’t f***ing do anything wrong! I just crossed the street.’ Since going up on YouTube Thursday, Quintero's video has gone viral, drawing more than 17,000 views, and counting. Internet hit: Quintero's video showing the four burly man overpowering the slender young jogger has gone viral in a day . The Austin Police Department has denied that the officers seen in the video were specifically targeting jaywalkers, claiming instead that they were working 'pedestrian enforcement' to ensure traffic safety. The agency spokesperson told MailOnline Miss Stephen has been charged with failure to identify and a class B traffic signal violation. As of Friday, she was not listed as an inmate in the local jail, suggesting that she has been released on bond. 'Maybe the plus size cops should follow her lead, and go on a jog instead of wasting tax dollars on trivial matters... just a thought,' Quintero wrote in his blog.","Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, charged with failure to identify and traffic signal violation in Austin, Texas .

"The longest-serving wrongfully convicted inmate in California has been set free after DNA testing proved his innocence. Michael Hanline, 68, was found guilty of shooting dead motorcyclist J.T. McGarry in 1978 and jailed for life without the possibility of parole. However, on Monday, following a 36-year battle to clear his name, Hanline stepped out of Ventura County Jail into the sunlight to be greeted by his wife, Sandee. Free man: Inmate Michael Hanline, 68, walks outside with his wife Sandee after being released from Ventura County jail - he is the longest-serving wrongfully convicted inmate in California . The last time he was a free man, Jimmy Carter was President and cell phone networks did not exist. When asked how he was feeling, Hanline told the LA Times: 'A rush of emotions; it's been a long time.' Holding his wife's hand and blinking in the daylight, he said he was 'ecstatic' to be going home with her and called her his 'rock'. Mrs Hanline sat waiting for her husband with his favorite pair of cowboy boots, which she had kept clean for the past three decades. Long time coming: Mrs Hanline greeted her husband with his favorite pair of cowboy boots, which she had kept clean for the past three decades . Reunited: Holding his wife's hand and blinking in the sunlight, Hanline said he was 'ecstatic' to be going home with her and called her his 'rock' 40 years ago: This 1974 photo shows Michael Hanline with his then girlfriend and now wife, Sandee . But he was unable to wear them due to a GPS tracking device around his ankle, which he must wear until a possible retrial. He has also been ordered to  not contact prosecutors, detectives or the family of the victim. Hanline was convicted of first-degree murder in 1980 for the killing of McGarry - also known as Mike Mathers. McGarry, who had ties to a motorcycle gang, disappeared from his home in November 10, 1978, and a few days later, his bullet-riddled body was found near a road some 30 miles away. Hanline was arrested after an investigation lasting a few weeks. His case was taken up by the California Innocence Project in 1999, whose lawyers persuaded prosecutors to re-examine the evidence. Subsequent testing showed DNA found at the crime scene did not come from Hanline or his alleged accomplice. In addition, prosecutors withheld evidence that should have been disclosed to Hanline's legal team during the trial. The reports also cast doubt on a  testimony by Hanline’s then-girlfriend, Mary Bischoff, who was granted immunity and was a key witness throughout. She was found  to be under the influence of drugs when she testified against him. Ready to leave: Michael Hanline, 68, was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1980 over the death of JT McGarry but new DNA evidence has come to light that put his original conviction in doubt . Life behind bars: Hanline waits in a cell during a hearing at Superior Court in Ventura, California . While prosecutors have not concluded Hanline is innocent, 'We don't have confidence in the conviction at this point,' prosecutor Michael D. Schwartz said. The California Innocence Project says Hanline's case was the longest wrongful incarceration in state history. A photograph provided by the project shows Hanline and his wife after his release. He wore a dark sweatshirt with the image of a California license plate and the letters 'XONR8,' representing the word 'exonerate.' He also held a cane in one hand, with his wife's palm firmly in the other. In a statement released through the Innocence Project, Hanline thanked his attorneys and prosecutors, and expressed a level of disbelief. 'I've watched half my life go by behind bars. I always hoped this day would come, but I can't believe that it's happening today,' Hanline said. Prosecutors in Ventura County will decide whether they want a retrial at a hearing scheduled for February 27.","Michael Hanline was serving life without parole for killing J.T. McGarry .

"The deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his wife Katherine relied on food stamps and public assistance from 2011 to 2012, soon after they became parents. New details have emerged about taxpayer money that was shelled out to the family of the bombing suspects, after the Mass. Gov. previously refused to divulge information on their welfare benefits. A state lawmaker was able to obtain data about government assistance the Tsarnaevs received and that information was passed on to the media. In need: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, left on April 20 in Cambridge, and her husband, right in 2009, began receiving welfare shortly after the birth of their daughter . Example: The suspects' parents Zubeidat, left, and Anzor, right both at a news conference on Thursday in Dagestan, Russia, also received federal and state welfare benefits when they lived in the U.S. On Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance detailed how the couple received food stamps from September 2011 to November 2012. The couple, who married in June 2010, are believed to have become parents to their daughter, Zahara, in 2011, in the months before they began receiving the aid. In addition to food stamps, the young family also benefited from TAFDC (Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children), a program for low income parents with dependent children. TAFDC is paid out twice a month and can be directly deposited into a recipient's bank account. The assistance was paid to Katherine, since a person must be a U.S. citizen, or eligible non-citizen, to receive the aid. While the couple took the government aid, the 24-year-old Rhode Island native would sometimes clock as many as 80 hours a week while . her unemployed husband stayed at home. Ultimately his wife's income made the couple ineligible for welfare and they stopped receiving state money in November 2012. First born: Tamerlan and Katherine's daughter Zahara, pictured this week with her grandmother Judith Russell in Rhode Island, is believed to have been born in 2011 . Welfare officials were forced to divulge details of the aid that was paid out to the family of the bombing suspects, a turn around from their previous strategy of stonewalling. Mass. Gov. Patrick Deval . signaled to state agencies this week that they should not discuss the details of what . government assistance Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had received, citing privacy concerns. Food Stamps: . Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2004: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps . Aug. 2009 to Dec. 2011: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps . Sep. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev received food stamps . Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (TAFDC): . Jan. 2003 to March 2003: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money . Aug. 2009 to June 2010: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money . Sept. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev collected TAFDC money . Though the welfare information is not . available for release unless the person in question provides their . consent - it is available to lawmakers. Thus, Mass. State . Representative David Linsky called on the Massachusetts . Department of Transitional Assistance to provide him with the information. Linksy issued an ultimatum on Thursday to welfare officials, . giving them 24 hours to provide the information. The letter from Rep. Linsky was provided to the Boston Herald. 'My office is working to fully comply with your request,'  DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan wrote in his report to Rep. Linsky, saying they were only providing a summary 'given the great interest in this matter.' In addition to the aid paid out to Tamerlan and his wife, both alleged bombers had benefited from welfare since their parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev collected foodstamps and TAFDC - from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2009 to 2011. Since the Tsarnaevs are Chechen immigrants, some wondered why they received aid but the state agency explained that they were considered eligible for the public assistance. 'The Tsarnaev parents were eligible to . receive benefits as legal, non-citizen residents who were granted asylum . status and met the basic eligibility criteria for DTA, including . household income levels, presence of dependent children and other . factors,' the DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan said in a letter . addressed to David Linsky, Chairman of the House Post Audit and . Oversight Committee. Breadwinner: Lawyers for Katherine Russell (pictured in high school yearbook photos) said the 24-year-old mother worked tirelessly as a home healthcare aid to support her young family. Her husband was unemployed . The governor of Massachusetts tried to stop state agencies from releasing welfare information this week. Gov. Deval Patrick's administration on Thursday flatly refused to answer any . media inquiries about taxpayers money that funded the suspected . bombers, citing the Tsarnaevs right to privacy. On Wednesday, state officials had confirmed that the deceased suspect, 26-year-old . Tamerlan, received welfare benefits. They also said the brothers' family had relied on state benefits when they were children. News that one of the alleged . terrorist had received state money sparked outrage in the community, . recovering after the blasts on April 15 that left 3 dead and more than . 260 injured. On Thursday, multiple state agencies, seemingly at the prompting of the Patrick administration, refused to comment further on benefits received by the brothers. Family: Zubeidat Tsarnaev, center with Tamerlan, and the child's father, Anzor, left, received state aid multiple times from 2002 to 2011 (pictured with an uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (right) in an undated photo) When asked if Tamerlan had received unemployment benefits, Labor . department spokesman Kevin Franck refused to comment, saying the matter . was 'confidential and not a matter of public record,' The Herald . reported. University . of Massachusetts Dartmouth spokesman Robert Connolly also refused to . comment on the financial aid application of 19-year-old sophomore Dzhokhar. 'It . is our position - and I believe the accepted position in higher . education - that student records including academic records and . financial records (including financial aid) cannot under federal law be . released without a student’s consent.' The Federal Communications Commission would not discuss whether the suspected bombers had a government-paid cellphone. Housing . officials in Cambridge also would not comment on if the brothers ever . had Section 8 assistance, a rental subsidy offered by the Department of . Housing and Urban Development to low income households. Wife: Katherine Tsarnaeva, pictured leaving her lawyer's office in Providence, R.I. on Tuesday, met Tamerlan in 2009 at a nightclub. They married in June 2010, when she was 21-years-old . Family. Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, center at the home of her parents in North Kingstown, R.I. on Sunday, has a 3-year-old daughter, Zahara, with her late husband . The Herald had reported that sources who knew Tamerlan said that though he sported a flashy appearance, he failed to earn very . much money for his family and was essentially a stay-at-home dad. His younger brother, on the other hand, has been described as more entrepreneurial. Dzhokhar, who was a sophomore at . University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, attended the school on a . scholarship and earned petty cash selling marijuana, sources told the . Boston Globe. Investigators are scrutinizing the . brothers' source of income, as they probe whether the pair received . outside assistance for their attack, either from a radical group or . foreign government. Security experts have noted though . that the modus operandi was relatively cheap, estimating that the . materials for each of the pressure cooker bombs used at the Boston . Marathon attack could have cost a total of $100 each. Tamerlan, 26, . died early on . April 19 after a shoot-out with police in Watertown, Mass. His . 19-year-old brother was captured late on April 19 after an extensive . manhunt. Marriage: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in 2009 at Boston's Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts center, was unemployed. Friends say he and his wife had a tempestuous relationship and said he would call Katherine a 'slut' and 'prostitute' Officials believe that Tamerlan became heavily influenced by radical Muslim ideology sometime between 2008 and 2009 before he met his future wife. A lawyer for the 24-year-old said she . was a student at Suffolk University in Boston when she was introduced to Tamerlan at a nightclub, believed to be sometime during 2009. Katherine Russell Tsarnaev converted to Islam to marry the terrorist suspect in June 2010, when she was 21-years-old . Around the same time, Russell became pregnant with Tamerlan's baby. She dropped out of school in her senior year and reportedly began pulling away from her friends and family. After their marriage, she lived with Tamerlan, 'raising her child and working long hours, caring for people in their homes who are unable to care for themselves,' her lawyers said in a statement. Suspects: State officials will not comment on the taxpayer money that was shelled out in welfare benefits for bombing suspects Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his brother Dzhokhar, right . Her husband reportedly looked after their young child, Zahara. Friends have told the media that the couple had a tempestuous relationship. Three of Russell's friends told National Public Radio's Laura Sullivan that Tsarnaev would often insult Russell and call her names, such as 'slut' and 'prostitute.' He was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects, including furniture, friends said. Tsarnaev was shot during a dramatic gunbattle with cops in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, before police said he was run over by his younger brother Dzhokhar as he tried to escape.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, received welfare up until 2012 .

"People addicted to watching pornography on the internet are in danger of suffering short-term memory loss which can have a major impact on their lives, according to new research. German scientists studied the part of the brain responsible for keeping information in the mind while using it to complete a task, critical for understanding, reasoning, problem solving and decision making. In the first research of its kind, they asked asked 28 men — all heterosexual with an average age of 26 — to look at a number of computer images, some pornographic and some nonsexual. An increasing number of people are now watching pornography on their phones in films starring the likes of former adult movie actress Jenna Jameson (right) The clean images included pictures of people doing a number of activities, such as laughing, playing sports or carrying a weapon. As the volunteers viewed the pictures, they touched a 'yes' or 'no' key to indicate whether the picture was the same as one they had seen four slides previously. The men logged a significantly greater number of incorrect answers when they viewed the porn than when they saw the nonsexual images. On average, they answered correctly 67 per cent of the time when they viewed pornographic pictures, rising to 80 per cent when they saw the clean pictures. According to researchers at the University of Duisburg-Essen, the findings could help psychologists understand why some people with internet porn addictions forget to sleep, miss appointments, shirk job responsibilities and neglect relationships. 'Sexual arousal and its impacts on cognitive processes might explain parts of these negative effects,' the researchers wrote. Previous research has linked the processing of pornographic pictures with areas of the brain responsible for emotion, arousal and attention. Dangerous: New research suggests men who turn to the internet for sexual gratification are risking their short-term memory (picture posed by model) 'Sexual arousal interferes with working memory, an important facet of executive functioning,' said study author Christian Laier, a graduate student studying under psychologist Matthias Brand. Because the current study focused solely on heterosexual men, it is impossible to say whether the findings would apply to gay men or to women. 'It is at its first stage,' said Laier. 'Our results need to be tested with respect to gender and sexual orientation to verify.' The study was published in November in the Journal of Sex Research.",German study finds men turn forgetful when looking at erotic images .
"John Howard has warned Tony Abbott that the biggest threat to him remaining Prime Minister at the next election emanates not from within but from being 'foolish enough' to disrespect and underestimate the man sitting on the opposite side of the house, Bill Shorten. Talk in political circles has increasingly focused on the growing popularity and leadership qualities of Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, notwithstanding the continued steady support of Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and the flagging public backing for the PM. John Howard, Australia's second longest serving Prime Minister, was discussing his new book 'The Menzies Era' (about the country's longest serving PM, Sir Robert Menzies) with Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday and had this advice for the incumbent: 'Any Opposition leader should be taken seriously. That’s my view, anybody in government who is foolish enough to dismiss an opposition leader will often pay a very heavy price.' John Howard (left) and Tony Abbott pictured together earlier this year at the official opening of the 'Menzies' exhibition in Canberra . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop with Tony Abbott at the Liberal Party executive meeting. Despite her increasing popularity, the PM's main concern should be at the threat posed by Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to his leadership, according to John Howard . 'Treat your opponent with both caution and respect'. John Howard greets Opposition Leader Bill Shorten at the Remembrance Day ceremony in Canberra. He, not perceived threats from within the party, is Tony Abbott's greatest cause for concern in trying to retain the Prime Ministership at the next election .

Megawati Sukarno Putri would later also go on to lead her country . John Howard's most respected Labor Prime Minister was Bob Hawke. When asked, he unhesitatingly nominated Mr Hawke saying 'I would put him ahead of all the others' 'The Labor Party ridiculed Tony Abbott when he became Opposition Leader, they said he was unelectable, they said he was this, that and the other, he won and he proved them wrong,' Mr Howard said. 'My advice to the Liberal Party is treat your opponent with both caution and respect.' While he rated the man who followed him as Coalition PM an 'eight out of 10' for his first year in the top job, Mr Howard added: 'I think he is experiencing what so many Prime Ministers do in their early years, he’s had his setbacks, he’s got a difficult Senate but he has achieved a lot of his major commitments and I think he’ll be able to ride through the adversity'. 'That’ll be a test of him, like every prime minister, he’ll be tested by events and judged accordingly but my assessment of his personality and intelligence is that he’ll handle those events effectively. 'Every Prime Minister has difficulties in the early years, I did, Menzies did, there’s a common and erroneous belief about Menzies that once he was elected in 1949 he just governed without hindrance for 16 years – that wasn’t the case. He had a very up and down time. 'There’s nothing unusual about a prime minister having some choppy weather in his early years. In fact, prime ministers have choppy weather through most of their years, unless their opponents are split badly and become unelectable.' Mr Howard's follow-up book to the best-selling 'Lazarus Rising' charts the history of Australia under the leadership of Menzies, whose first foray as PM actually ended in tears; when 'he suffered the ignominy of losing the prime ministership, something that most people saw as the end of his political career'. But he returned, in triumph, to not only form the Liberal Party of Australia but to go on and govern for another 16 years, between 1949 and 1966. Menzies leads Sir Donald Bradman and English captain Ted Dexter from the field at the PM's Eleven match in Canberra, 1963. Like his predecessor, John Howard has a deep affinity for the game . Mr Howard shares a joke with another former prime minister in Paul Keating (right) at the Lowy Institute in Sydney . John Howard came up against several Labor Opposition Leaders during his tenure as PM, here he shakes hands with then ALP leader Mark Latham ahead of the 2004 ballot . Mr Howard speaking about his new book 'The Menzies Era' at the Sydney Institute last month . As for the widely publicised Jacqui Lambie breakway from the Palmer United Party this past week and the general rise of minor parties, Mr Howard said the political landscape had changed and, it is a challenge for the major parties to come to terms with it. 'It is a question of whether it is a good thing or a bad thing in the sense that it’s what the people want and from time to time people will express their dissatisfaction with the two major parties by voting for smaller parties and that’s the democratic process,' he said. 'You don’t try and react to it by thinking you can change the rules to stop it happening, you won’t achieve that and you shouldn’t try to. 'What you should do is try and address the reasons why people are disenchanted with the 2 major parties and that’s a responsibility of my party and obviously a responsibility for the Labor Party.' But he's equally sure there is no real need for a third major party, as Australia once boasted. 'I think you need a strong two-party system and I think the nature of modern politics is that fewer people are rusted on to the respective sides of politics and you have what I called detachable flanks of 10 to 15 per cent of voters on either side who go off at various stages,' Mr Howard added. 'I don’t think you will see a third party emerging which is the equal of either the Labor Party or the Coalition but you will for some time, for the foreseeable future you will have this detachment on the two sides of politics. 'When I was first involved in politics there was a 40/40/20 rule that 40 per cent were always Coalition, 40 per cent were always Labor and 20 per cent in the middle. 'One sometimes feels now that it’s 30/30/40, that there are a lot more people prone to change between elections, there are fewer people who are rusted on to either side of politics and that will produce the phenomena that we now have, if it’s not the Palmer United Party it will be something else in the future, it’s just a feature of Australian politics now. 'I don’t think it will lead to a formation of a party which is the equal of or even a serious rival to the Labor Party or the Coalition.' 'The Menzies Era' charts the 23 year period from 1949 to 1972 when the Coalition held office in Australia, winning seven elections in a row with Sir Robert taking the lead for much of that period . While he warned the Coalition against underestimating those on the other side of the chamber, Mr Howard agreed there are parallels between the ALP which Menzies confronted and what has occurred within the Labor Party in recent years. 'There’s no doubt that he (Menzies) benefited enormously from the Labor Party split and the Labor Party was unelectable for a full decade, literally unelectable, they were in terrible shape,' Mr Howard said. 'He was very fortunate in that sense and the Labor Party was a better disciplined organisation in the 80s and 90s and onwards than what it was in the 1950s. 'It’s certainly been a shambles quite recently but not as cataclysmic as the split, the split in the 1950s caused enormous bitterness that lasted for a generation.' But he did have kind words for one Labor leader, unhesitatingly nominating Bob Hawke as the ALP Prime Minister he most respected. 'Hawke. I think he was more successful as a Labor Prime Minister than any of the others. The Labor Prime Ministers I dealt with ... I came in when Whitlam was PM and then Hawke and Keating, then Rudd and Gillard and Rudd again, so I would put him ahead of the others,' Mr Howard said. The former PM also backed Tony Abbott's so-called shirt-front tactics against Russian president Vladimir Putin over the MH17 tragedy, claiming 'I think Abbott’s rhetoric is quite justified'. Mr Howard, the nation's 25th PM, spent the best part of two and a half years in the labour of love which was researching and writing of the Menzies era. For now though, he says, he'll focus on promoting his latest works, while keeping a close eye on his beloved Australian cricket eleven trying to score more success over the summer. Another piece of prose, however, may not be too far away. He concluded by comparing being interviewed as an author to being grilled as a politician. 'There are similarities in both. You are asked to recall what you have written in one iteration and you are asked to recall what you have said in another,' Mr Howard said.","John Howard's warning to Tony Abbott it would be 'foolish' to dismiss Bill Shorten as a real threat .

"Coal mines in the North East may have closed many years ago, but coal is still making a living for a few hardy men. Tony Reed is one such 'sea-coaler' - someone who makes their living by collecting and selling coal washed up on the beaches of Hartlepool in County Durham. The 51-year-old has to plan his work around the moon, because every low tide the waves at Seaton Carew beach in Hartlepool bring ashore tons of coal washed up from seams in the bed of the North Sea. Black gold: Tony Reed, pictured, is a 'sea-colaer' who spends all day scraping coal off of a beach in Hartlepool, County Durham . Fuel: Mr Reed and the 18 other sea-coalers harvest thousands of tonnes of coal a year, which is burned for energy . Twice a day at the low tide Mr Reed rakes the washed-up black coal deposits into small piles and them shovels them into his specially-adapted Land Rover pickup. It is backbreaking physical labour. The sodden coal particles are heavy and must be scraped up using only a rake and shovel. It is not known where the seams lie exactly, but the seabed is constantly eroded by the currents and every tide lifts its load and drags it to shore. Collection: This back-breaking labour allows Mr hall and his colleagues to collect around a tonne of coal each every day . Transport: Mr Hall uses an adapted Land Rover to transport the coal, but bollards erected by the local council mean he can no longer get it on the beach . Stoic: The work is incredibly arduous and the men must move quickly to harvest the coal . Dispute: Some say the sea-coalers provide a valuable service, others claim they damage they are bad for the beach . A seasoned sea-coaler, Tony has been scouring the sands for 30 years on and off, and on an average day he can get up to a tonne, which sells for about £10. He is one of a small group of men in Hartlepool who scrape a living from the back-breaking work, which sees them heading for the shore at any given hour. On average, 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes a year will be collected from the beaches around Hartlepool, before being transported to power stations. Heft: The seawater makes the coal particles very heavy, and the only way to lift the dust onto the Land Rover is by hand . The coal is washed up from seams on the ocean floor. The amount varies day to day . Dispute: Hartlepool Council says sea-coaling must stop as the beach is for pedestrians only . But with much of the UK's coal-fired power stations facing imminent retirement under the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive, making a living from sea-coaling may soon become a footnote in the history of the British coal industry. The industry is not without its detractors. Many residents claim it is dangerous and causes damage to the beaches, but some claim the sea-coalers provide a vital public service by keeping the beaches clean. In 2001 there were an estimated 20 sea-coalers operating in Hartlepool. In the seventh century, the monks of the nearby village of Blackhall Rocks burned the coal for warmth . Ancient: The coal was first gathered by monks in the 7th Century . Uncertainty: Coal-fired plants are under threat, throwing doubt onto the future of sea-coaling's future . Veteran: Mr Reed has been sea-coaling on and off since he was 21, more than 30 years . Fuel: The coal is transported to power stations . Hard: The coal is swept into a series of small piles and then hauled onto the pick-up Land Rovers . Scraping together: An average load on the Land Rovers is two tonnes .","Images show the back-breaking work done by 'sea-coalers'

"For decades, scientists have been trying to discover the origins of many insect species by studying the Blind Brora centipede. With ancestors dating back over 400 million years, the centipede, also known as Strigamia maritima, is mainly used to study the differences across invertebrates. Now experts have revealed that the myriapod is missing an internal body clock, as well as vital light receptors seen across the animal kingdom by sequencing its genome for the first time. Researchers from Cambridge University have sequenced the first full myriapod genome from the Strigamia maritima, which is of interest because they believe the creature could shed light on the ancestor of beetles and crabs, as well as some other invertebrates . Researchers from the Universities of St Andrews and Cambridge  uncovered these findings after they sequenced the first full myriapod genome - a complete set of DNA - from the centipede. Strigamia is part of the myripod family - a group that includes the centipedes and millipedes - which can be used to explore the genetic basis of centipede biology and the evolution of arthropods, including crabs and beetles. The team, whose findings are published in the journal Plos Biology, used this sequence to recreate many features of the genetic make-up of the ancestral arthropod. For example, they discovered it has a large number of near-identical segments, with one or two pairs of legs on each. The type of centipede is favoured by scientists for the accessibility of its nests, from which embryos can be gathered for research purposes (pictured). Experts have revealed that the myriapod is missing an internal body clock, as well as vital light receptors seen across the animal kingdom . The genome sequence of the centipede Strigamia maritima has allowed scientists to reconstruct many features of the genetic make-up of the ancestral arthropod. They hope to learn more about the evolution of insects, crustaceans, chelicerates such as spiders and myriapods - centipedes and millipedes - from it. The evolution of the huge biodiversity of these, animals and the information encoded in their genomes, is poorly understood. While a number of studies have been done on the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the Strigamia genome could demonstrate that much has changed during the evolution of the fly genome, as well as insect genomes more generally. This makes a strong case for studying a wider range of species to develop a deeper understanding of animal biology. This centipede genome also provides examples of differences in how insects and myriapods independently conquered the land. For example, their sense of smell is achieved by different sets of molecules. Lead author Dr David Ferrier, of St Andrews University in Scotland, said: 'This genome of Strigamia has proved to be particularly valuable in deducing the content of important gene families in the ancestral arthropod, this ancestor being the starting point for the evolution of the huge diversity of arthropods that we currently see today. 'There has been a high turn-over in arthropod gene and genome organisation, with lots of rearrangements and plenty of gene losses during the evolution of animals, like the insects. 'The sorts of reconstructions that have been made possible by this new myriapod genome provide a foundation for delving more deeply into the biology of these genetic changes.' Perhaps one of the most surprising findings is that these centipedes seem to have lost the genes programming the known light receptors used by animals, as well as the genes controlling the body's internal clock. Professor Michael Akam, of Cambridge University, said: 'Strigamia live underground and have no eyes, so it is not surprising that many of the genes for light receptors are missing, but they behave as if they are hiding from the light. 'They must have some alternative way of detecting when they are exposed. 'Curious, too, that this creature appears to have no body clock - or if it does, it must use a system very different to other animals.' He began making trips to Brora on the Scotland coast, to hunt out Strigamia a decade ago. Research at the Brora beach is likely to continue for years.","Researchers have sequenced the first full genome  from Strigamia maritima .

"More than 6,000 people were evacuated after explosions rocked a Russian munitions depot last night where up to 13million shells are stored. At least 30 people were injured when the shells exploded, causing huge blasts at the Chapaevsk military depot in the Samara region. Reports from Russia said about 1,500 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze and residents were evacuated from the nearby village of Nagorny, about 15km from the city of Chapaevsk. Scroll down for video . More than 6,000 people had to be evacuated after the huge blasts at Chapaevsk military depot . About 30 people were injured when the depot, which stores up to 13million shells, exploded . The first explosion happened at about 3pm on Tuesday and continued for hours afterwards . The Emergencies Ministry said about four people needed hospital treatment after five explosions triggered the fire. The first was reported at about 3pm yesterday and further blasts were still being heard hours later. It is still not clear what caused the shells to explode. More than 200 engines were sent to the scene but reports said firefighters initially struggled to get close to the blaze because of the danger of the exploding shells. Local authorities declared a state of emergency after the explosions, according to RT.com. The Federal Investigative Committee said it was set off by the 'involuntary' explosions of shells. Huge plumes of black smoke rising from the site could be seen for miles . A third explosion is seen at the military depot near Chapayevsk city, Samara . Fires form the explosions of military ammunition spread into fields surrounding the town. Many of the people injured by the explosions lived nearby . Hundreds of police, paramedics and firefighters were sent to the scene of the explosions . The military depot is about 15km from the city of Chapaevsk and about 1,000km from Moscow . Videos of the explosions uploaded online show a huge ball of flame being sent hundreds of feet into the air. Dark plumes of smokes were also pictured rising from the site. Ministry official Vladimir Stepanov said: 'Some 6,000 people were evacuated . from a nearby village. 'More . than 30 people sought medical help, four of them are hospitalised.'

"An eight-year-old boy in South Carolina drowned in freak circumstances in an above-ground, backyard pool while swimming in three-feet of water last week. Investigators have speculated that Gavin Quance - who was on the school swim team - became entangled or stuck under the pool cover which had bunched at one end of the water. Indeed, when his distraught mother found her son face-down in the pool, the ladder was lying on the lawn a few feet away as if knocked and a hose was still filling up the tank. So dad: Gavin Quance, eight-years-old, passed away on July 14 after a freak accident while swimming at home in South Carolina . Missed: Gavin and his 14-year-old brother, Cooper (bottom left) who has been left distraught by his younger sibling's death . Autopsy results are due from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, Beaufort County Coroner Ed Allen said on Thursday according to The State. The initial assessment by emergency service were that that boy had not suffered any injuries or struck his head from a fall. The tragic child's 14-year-old brother, Cooper, told police that he was asleep when the accident happened and he was awoken by his mother's screams when she found her eight-year-old floating face down. Amanda Quance had been checking on her son periodically and desperately tried to perform CPR when she brought him out of the water. Parents: Jim and Amanda Quance canceled their wedding anniversary celebrations came six days after their sons death and were planned beforehand . The teenage brother waited indoors with his two-year-old brother while emergency services joined the battle to save Gavin. The teenager said he 'didn't understand what was happening,' according to the police report. Distraught, he told reporters from The State that he couldn't see why his brother could not be saved. In fact, he had a cousin who nearly drowned as a toddler in Florida but was saved by external defibrillators. Sadly, Gavin Quance could not saved by a defibrillator. His family have launched a GoFundMe page to help with costs.","Gavin Quance lost his life in family pool as it was filling with water in South Carolina .

"Web retailers are turning up the hype around internet Christmas shopping with claims Black Friday will simply be the first of three record-breaking days. Industry leaders suggest internet spending on Friday will hit an all-time high for a single day of £555.5million – over £385,000 a minute. But they predict the figure will be higher still three days later on Cyber Monday, once people have browsed the web for bargains over the weekend, with spending predicted to reach £649.6million. And they expect even these colossal figures will be outdone on the following Monday – so-called Manic Monday – with the total estimated at £676.5million. On Cyber Monday, once people have browsed the web for bargains over the weekend, online spending is predicted to reach £649.6million. File picture . The figures are based on shopping habits in previous years and come from the IMRG, which is the trade body for web retailers, and the spending and credit experts Experian. The frenzy around Black Friday is testament to the fact Britain has become a global hot house for internet shopping – leading the way for the rest of the world. Families in this country spend more online per head of population than any other nation in the world, including the US. However, this shift has had many negative consequences for traditional bricks and mortar stores, which have put up the shutters, and town centres. Traditional retailers are trying to combat this by turning Black Friday - so named as it is when shops usuallty start making a profit, or go ‘into the black’- into an event for the high street to mirror the pattern in the US, where it is seen as the start of the Christmas shopping season. Asda, which is owned by American giant Wal-Mart, has been in the vanguard of efforts to push Black Friday into stores here. Last year, this led to a number of rowdy confrontations as people battled over cut-price TVs. Staff at the Amazon Swansea fulfilment centre process orders as they prepare their busiest time of the year. File picture . Many other retailers, such as Boots and House of Fraser, are now joining the Black Friday push with promises to slash prices by as much as 70 per cent. Research by the IMRG and Experian suggests there will be spending of £555.5million and 124million visits to web stores on Friday, which would be up 17 per cent on last year. It puts spending on Cyber Monday at £649.6m - £451,000 a minute – with visits to web stores at 145m, which would be up 26 per cent on 2013. The prediction for Manic Monday is £676.5m - £470,000 a minute – and 151m visits, which would also be 26 per cent higher than last year. Internet stores say people are pushing their web shopping closer to Christmas because they are more confident that they will get their items, either delivered to their home or through click and collect. IMRG’s chief information officer, Tina Spooner, said: ‘The US phenomenon of Black Friday is now firmly embedded in the UK e-retail calendar and, while the first two weeks of December are traditionally the peak festive trading weeks for the online retail industry, Black Friday now marks the start of the online shopping season. ‘Smartphones and tablets are set to account for over half of all traffic to retail websites during the festive season and on Black Friday alone, online spend via mobile devices is set to reach over £196m. ‘E-retail sales have grown 17 per cent year-to-date in 2014 and retailers are increasingly confident in their online performance during the fourth quarter, which indicates the industry is gearing up for another record-breaking Christmas.’ Experian’s James Miller said the switch to online Christmas shopping is being driven by the fact it is now viewed as an important leisure activity for a wide variety of people, from active middle-income families with teenage children to young singles. ‘These tech-savvy groups are typically early adopters of new technology trends, prolific online shoppers, and active users of mobile and tablet devices,’ he said. A survey by the vouchercloud website found almost two in three – 62 per cent – would be browsing for bargains on Friday. Top of the shopping lists are televisions, tablet computers, clothing, toys and games consoles. Matthew Wood, of vouchercloud.com , said: ‘Our friends from across the pond have certainly helped to create even more of a retail frenzy in the run up to Christmas than already existed. All of the UK’s largest brands now participate in the special festive event and it is certainly seen as the catalyst to spark the Christmas shopping season.’ House of Fraser is promising price cuts on selected items on Friday through to Monday. There are a number of deals that will only be available on Friday, including £120 off a Dyson handheld vacuum, bringing it down to £99; £60 off Jamie Oliver pan sets and 70per cent off some Samsonite suitcases. Deals at Boots through the weekend include a Toni & Guy Style Session Straightener, which is 46 per cent off at £26.99, and a Philips Sonicare . Diamond Clean Pink Rechargeable Toothbrush, which is down by £150 to £99.99. Amazon has been running a series of ‘Black Friday’ deals all this week. The latest include the Trust Jukebar Wireless Speaker which is 45 per cent off at £22.99 and its Kindle Fire HD tablet, which is down from £199 to £99.","Internet spending on Friday could hit £555.5m – over £385,000 a minute .

"A former college professor who underwent a double arm transplant last month at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston says the best thing about the operation is that he's able to hug his loved ones again. Will Lautzenheiser with both arms still in partial casts on Tuesday — said at a news conference he's grateful to the anonymous donor who 'will always be as close to me as my own skin.' Lautzenheiser is a former professor of film production and screenwriting at Boston University and Montana State University who became a quadruple amputee in 2011 following a streptococcal infection.

Before his illness: Will Lautzenheiser, pictured here before falling ill, lost both arms following a streptococcal infection back in 2011 but luckily had life changing arm transplant surgery last month . Hard work: Will Lautzenheiser's rehabilitation hasn't been easy but he hasn't given up and now that he's received a double arm transplant he can hug his loved ones once again . He underwent a nearly nine-hour operation last month that involved 13 surgeons. In June, when the surgery was announced, Lautzenheiser told the Boston Herald he was afraid, but could not wait for the day he can hug his niece and his partner and hold a camera once again so he can pursue his dreams of becoming a filmmaker. 'There’s a goal,' he said before the life changing surgery. The Massachusetts native had already started a second career as a club comic before the transplant. Because he's in a wheel chair,  Lautzenheiser humorously calls himself a 'sit down comic.' Those who are interested in learning more about Lautzenheiser's story can watch a ten minute documentary called Stumped about his rehabilitation and how he managed to pursue his goals as a filmmaker and performer despite being a quadruple amputee. Humor has been a powerful coping mechanism for Lautzenheiser and the Boston Globe reports that at a press conference back in June a video of Lautzenheiser's stand up brought the crowd to chuckles. 'I keep you on your toes,' Lautzenheiser said to a club audience in the video, 'because I don’t have any.' Back in June Lautzenheiser said he hoped his surgery can pave the way for other amputees requiring medical care and mentioned the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing who were left without limbs. 'We’ve shown we really are Boston strong, and that’s not just a catch phrase,' he said. 'The support we’ve given to people who have disabilities, however they’ve been obtained, is huge.' Sense of humor: Will Lautzenheiser hasn't let his being an amputee stop him from living a fulfilling life . Amazing feat: Will Lautzenheiser talks to Dr. Simon Talbot, a member of his massive transplant team of 13 surgeons that aided in the successful arm transplant last month .

"Former President Bill Clinton says wife Hillary has recovered from the concussion and blood clot she suffered a year and a half ago. Speaking at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation’s annual Fiscal Summit in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Clinton said Hillary had done six months of 'very serious work' to overcome her health issues and she 'seems to have more stamina now.' 'Look, she works out every week. She is strong. She is doing . great,' Clinton said according to Buzzfeed. 'As far as I can tell, she’s in better shape than I am.' Former President Bill Clinton laughs as he answers a question from Gwen Ifill of PBS NewsHour regarding Republicans' questions regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's head injury at the 2014 Fiscal Summit in Washington, D.C. Former George W. Bush adviser Karl . Rove kicked off a discussion about Hillary's physical condition last week when he . suggested at a conference that she was hiding something about her . health. 'Thirty days in the . hospital?' Rove said, according to the New York Post. 'And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for . people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with . that.' The Post insinuated that Rove claimed Hillary may be suffering from brain damage as a result of the clot. 'Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there . are no words for this level of lying,'  Clinton spokesman Nick . Merrill fired back. 'She is 100%. Period,' he said of Hillary's heath. Rove told Fox News yesterday he never said Hillary had brain damage. 'She had a serious health episode and my point was . that I think it was from the 7th of December in 2012 through the 7th of . January of 2013, she underwent, first she had apparently a serious . virus,' he said after being confronted with the fact that the former secretary of state was only in the hospital for three days, not 30 days. After Rove explained his comments on Fox, Merrill accused Republicans of politicizing Hillary's health. 'First they . accused her of faking it, now they've resorted to the other extreme -- . and are flat out lying,' he said. 'Even this morning, Karl Rove is still all over . the map and is continuing to get the facts wrong. But he doesn't care, . because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, . and he's succeeding. It's flagrant and thinly veiled.' Picture of health: Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton waves to the audience at the conclusion of her address to the American Jewish Committee (AJC) Global Forum in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. Clinton has been traveling the country, giving speeches since July 2013 - six months after the State Department said she had 'fully recovered' from her accident in December 2012 . Hillary Clinton took ill in December 2012 just as she was supposed to testify before a Congressional committee about the terrorist attack that took four American lives in Benghazi, Libya three months before. As a result of the blood clot, Clinton did not appear before Congress until the following month, leading some Republicans to speculate about the timing of her hospitalization. Clinton left the State Department in February of that year, and hit the speaking circuit just five months later. She's spent the last year giving speeches on he own behalf and on behalf of the Clinton Foundation and working on her memoir, Hard Choices, which comes out in June. She is a presumed 2016 presidential candidate. Today Bill Clinton said he was 'sort of dumbfounded' by Republicans' on going questions about Hillary's health, saying they would do 'whatever it takes' to sully her political career. 'First they they said she faked her concussion. And . now they say she's auditioning for a part on the Walking Dead,' he . said. Clinton laughed Hillary's critics off, saying, 'You can’t be too upset about it.' 'It’s just the beginning. They’ll get better and better about it,' he said. 'It’s just part of the deal.' As for Rove, Clinton said, 'I got to give him . credit, you know, that embodies that old saying that consistency is the . hobgoblin of little minds.'","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suffered a concussion and blood clot in December 2012, for which she was hospitalized for three days .

"Watchdog? Edward Snowden gave his first interview since outing himself famously as the NSA leaker. In it, he called out the American media for being complacent toward government power grabs . In his first interview since he outed himself as the source of leaked NSA documents, Edward Snowden said the media has given the government a free pass to grow unchecked power ever since the attacks of September 11. ‘[It] ended up costing the public dearly,’ the 30-year-old newly minted Russia resident told the New York Times in a Q&A published Tuesday. Snowden’s interview  focused on journalists and the media, which he said need to wake up to the realities of surveillance. ‘Any unencrypted message sent over the Internet is being delivered to every intelligence service in the world,’ he said. Snowden’s Q&A was, of course, . done through encrypted emails. Laura Poitras, the documentary filmmaker . who helped Snowden spill his secrets, served as intermediary, having won . the former NSA contractor’s trust months ago. ‘Laura was more suspicious of me than I was of her, and I’m famously paranoid,’ Snowden told Times reporter Peter Maass. Poitras may have reason to be suspicious. Snowden, . in describing his methods for choosing a reporter to work with while . searching for a way to tell the world what he knew, said that basically . all emails are possible targets for government surveillance. Middle man: Laura Poitras helped Snowden leak what he knew. She also acted as intermediary between the New York Times and Snowden, who claimed nearly all emails from the media wind up in the hands of government agencies . Those from news organizations, he suggested, are all the more likely to be read. 'Assume . that your adversary is capable of a trillion guesses per second,' he . wrote to Poitras at the start of their work together, a relationship the New York Times documents alongside the Snowden interview. ‘In . the wake of this year’s disclosures,’ he said, invoking the information . about the NSA he himself leaked, ‘it should be clear that unencrypted . journalist-source communication is unforgivably reckless.’ But . Snowden, who had his American passport revoked in June and was recently . granted asylum by the Russian government after weeks in territorial . limbo, simultaneously faulted media outlets for being too permissive . about government misdeeds in the post-9/11. 'Assume that your adversary is capable of a trillion guesses per second': While saying media has dropped the ball, Snowden warns that they, too, are being watched . ‘The . most important news outlets in America abdicated their role as a check . to power,’ Snowden told the paper of record, ‘for fear of being seen as . unpatriotic and punished in the market during a period of heightened . nationalism. From a business perspective, this was the obvious strategy, . but what benefited the institutions ended up costing the public . dearly.’ But for all their complacency, Snowden says, big media organizations are slowly returning to the way they once were. ‘The major outlets are still only beginning to recover from this cold period,’ he said. Snowden’s own actions, meanwhile, have surely hastened the process.","'I'm famously paranoid': The NSA leaker claims every unencrypted email sent by journalists is delivered to the world's intelligence agencies .

"Three high school students have been accused of raping three freshman during a school-sponsored sports camp. Galileo Mondol, 17, and two 16-year-old boys were charged Friday with raping three male freshmen during a sports camp sponsored by Somerville High School, where all six boys are students, according to reports. The school’s athletic department was made aware of the allegations Tuesday. The two 16-year-olds have not been identified because they are minors. Horrific: Galileo Mondol, 17, and two 16-year-old boys are accused of brutally raping three freshman male students . Mondol and the two minors are alleged to have entered the cabin where the boys were sleeping an sexually assaulted them. All six males are members of the school’s soccer team, said reports. ‘These are terrible allegations. I’m disturbed and appalled that they may have happened,’ Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone said at a news conference Friday.’“Be clear on this, these allegations go far beyond hazing. This is rape.’ Curtatone volunteers for the coaching staff of the football team and was one of 24 adult chaperones at the camp, the Boston Herald reported. Each cabin had an adult chaperone inside, according to WHDH. Mondol has been charged with aggrevated rape of a child under 16, indecent assault and battery, two counts of assault with intent to rape a child under 16 and three counts each of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and intimidation of a witness. The minors face similar charges. Disturbing: Mondol is taken out of the police station following his arrest in September . ‘In no way are these allegations a reflection on the team, our kids, [or] our community,’ Curtatone added. Somerville High School, which sponsors the team-building retreat annually, was made aware of the charges Tuesday, according to WBZ. The students were arrested Friday. ‘All of us, frankly, are horrified at these allegations,’ school superintendent Tony Pierantozzi said at Friday’s news conference in Somerville with the mayor and other school officials. ‘We will ensure to the best of our ability that everyone and anyone who needs support will have it.’ Mondol is being held on a $100,000 bail, but his lawyer claims he’s innocent. A retreat: Somerville High School has taken athletes on the three-day retreat for 15 years and this is the first known incident of its kind . Pleading not guilty: Mondol's attorney claims his client is innocent and that 'his parents support him 100 per cent' ‘We will plead not guilty Tuesday because my client is not guilty,’ attorney William Korman said in a statement to the media. ‘He has absolutely no criminal history. He has never been in trouble before. We steadfastly maintain his innocence. His parents support him 100 per cent.’ A total of 165 student athletes attended the camp, 62 boy football players, 61 boy soccer players and 42 girl soccer players, with eight coaches per team as supervisors, according to Pierantozzi. The school has taken athletes to the camp for the past 15 years, and makes them sign no-hazing pledges before taking part in the three night trip, said Curtatone. Curtatone stood by the students, praising their courage and pledging support. ‘[This incident] not define us… our spirit and character is defined by the courage shown by the victims and by the team. They have stood up and spoken out... and we will stand up with them and for them.’ All three suspects are currently in custody and will be arraigned on Tuesday, as courts are closed for the Labor Day holiday weekend.","Galileo Mondol. 17, and two 16-year-old students are accused of raping three freshmen in their cabins .

When the students received the much anticipated yearbook, they were shocked to see they appear to be wearing a different outfit. SCROLL FOR VIDEO . A Utah high school has used Photoshop to censor its yearbook photos because it deemed some female students' pictures too sexy . Upset: Sophomore Kimberly Montoya said her shirt 'was a cream color, and the color of the cover-up was completely white. It looked like white-out on my skin' Some have now complained, and said they also feel upset because the decisions whether to alter the photos or not were not made consistently. 'I feel like they put names in a hat and pick and choose who,' Sophomore Rachel Russel told KSTU-TV. 'There were plenty of girls (who) were wearing thicker tank tops and half of them got edited and half of them didn't.' Russel's original picture showed her wearing a sleeveless top. But the version seen in the yearbook has black sleeves added on. Sophomore . Kimberly Montoya added: 'My shirt was a cream color, and the color of . the cover-up was completely white.

Tattoo: The school decided this student's tattoo was too provocative . Sneaky: Wasatch High School, pictured, altered the images of certain students to show less skin without them knowing about it . Students raised the issue with high school administrators, who said the yearbook couldn't be changed after printing. Wasatch County School District Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker later defended the general decision to edit images for modesty. He claimed students know the dress code and there was a sign warning them that their pictures may be altered. However, Shoemaker admits the school school have taken a more consistent approach. 'We only apologize in the sense that we want to be more consistent with what we're trying to do in that sense we can help kids better prepare for their future by knowing how to dress appropriately for things,' Shoemaker said. The school district dress code's ban on 'extreme clothing' lists 'revealing shorts, skirts, dresses, tank shirts, halter or crop tops, spaghetti straps, etc.'","Wasatch High School in Utah altered the images of certain female students to show less skin without them knowing about it .

"Registered a complaint: Adam Landerman, 21, has moaned about the conditions inside Will County Adult Detention Facility while awaiting trial for a double murder . The 21-year-old son of an Illinois police office waiting trial for two brutal murders appears to have confused his prison for a hotel. Adam Landerman of Joliet filed a 15-count complaint to a Will County judge about the conditions at Will Country Adult Detention Facility, moaning about the timing and quality of meals and that the towels are too small. Whining that the prison is too cold for him while he awaits trial for the murders of Terrance Rankins and Eric Glover, the particular inmate has been told quite curtly by local law enforcement to put up or shut up. 'We’re not a hotel; we’re a jail,' Will County Sheriff’s Deputy Chief Ken Kaupas said. 'We treat all of our in-custodies in a fair way.' Among the litany of complaints from Landerman are that the jail serves boring, small plates of food and that the library is not stocked to his satisfaction. Landerman has claimed that he is being treated indecently because he is forced to wake and eat breakfast at 6.15am every morning and eat lunch at 10am. 'The meals served to detainees at the WCADF are wholly and completely inadequate in quantity to satisfy grown male detainees, leaving them suffering from hunger pangs and leading to altercations with other detainees and rule violations involving hoarding and storing food,' Landerman moans in his complaint according to The Chicago Tribune. Prison: Will County Adult Detention Facility is the subject of a 15-count complaint asking a Will County judge to remedy various conditions at the jail . He also demands 'up to date' library books be provided, free soap for shaving and the heat be turned up because it is causing him 'sleep deprivation'. He claims the conditions are in violation of state code and wants them fixed. The complaint is scheduled to be heard in court on August 28. Landerman has been in custody since the murders of Eric Glove and Terrence Ranking, both 22, in January 2013 after an attempted robbery.

The other person present that evening, Alisa Massaro, 20, of Joliet, pleaded guilty recently to the lesser charges of robbery and concealing a homicide in exchange for a 10-year sentence and to also testify against the others. Police claim that the four lured Glover and Rankins to Massaro's home and murdered them. McKee left them while they were playing video games and returned home where she confessed to her father, who called the police and told them where they were.","Adam Landerman of Joliet, Illinois has filed a complaint with a judge about conditions in jail .

"G-Shot injection pumps filler into women's G spot . Increases G spot to size of 10p coin . Takes just thirty minutes . More than 2,000 women have undergone the procedure in five years . It is a sexual quest that has frustrated couples for decades and as a result many people don't even believe that the G Spot exists. But now help is at hand and the sex lives of couples worldwide could be enhanced dramatically thanks to a single jab. The 'G-Shot' injection is a surgical procedure which claims to improve women's sex lives by pumping filler into her G spot. The G-Shot could help improve the sex lives of couples worldwide as more than 2,000 women have rushed to experience the latest procedure in LA . The collagen jab, which will set you back £800, temporarily increases the G-spot's size to that of a 10p coin. The 'lunchtime' procedure involves an injection given under local anesthetic and can be completed in just half an hour. The injection pumps collagen into a women's G Spot and can be completed in just half an hour . It is certainly proving a hit in Los Angeles where women are rushing to the Vaginal Rejuvenation Institute of America for their fix. Gynaecologist and surgeon Dr David Matlock who works at the clinic even organises monthly sessions where women tempted by the G shot can come down and discuss the procedure. 'I want to empower and educate, and for women to be in tune with themselves. 'Why is it so difficult to accept? Because it's not something like your nose that you can point to that you can see or feel,' explained Dr Matlock in an interview with Fabulous magazine. More than 2,000 women have undergone the procedure at his clinic since it launched five years ago. And although women have been flying over to the states to experience the latest treatment, it is also increasingly becoming available in the UK. Sheela Purkayastha, M.D. Consultant Gynaecologist at The BUPA Cromwell Hospital was one of the first female gynaecologists on this side of the pond to offer the jab. The £800 treatment has so far been 'relatively popular' and is carried out in a Harley Street clinic where the emphasis is on comfort. In 2008 Caroline Cushworth sat her partner Christopher down and asked him a simple question. Caroline Cushworth really rates the treatment . If, she said, I could be guaranteed an orgasm every time we had sex, what would be your reaction? Not that surprisingly, her partner Christopher, 27, a plasterer, replied that he'd be delighted. 'So I told him I wanted to have a brand-new treatment which would . enable me to do just that - and also make my orgasms much more intense . than normal,' says Caroline. 'His jaw literally hit the floor and he said, ""Sounds good to me."" 'And . so, Caroline became the first British woman to have the . 'G-shot', also known as the 'orgasm jab'. And, as Caroline can testify, the results were . tremendous. 'I have quite literally never experienced anything quite . like it,' she says. 'I had constant multiple orgasms which went on for . hours. 'That first time, the . whole thing was so intense I was actually a bit scared. I was so . overcome, but thankfully the intensity is something I've got used to. I . still have multiple orgasms every time I have sex, but they no longer . leave me flat on my back.' Although Caroline, a 41-year-old . business developer from Leeds who has no children, says she's always . enjoyed a healthy sex life, it wasn't until a few years ago that she . first discovered her G-spot. She . says: 'I personally thought anyone who said they climaxed through . intercourse alone was lying. And I didn't really believe in the G-spot. 'But . a few years ago, my partner at the time said he wanted to find it. We . actually set aside an entire afternoon and spent hours searching for my . G-spot.' 'Finding the damned thing in the first place was no . easy feat and wasn't exactly the most erotic of experiences, but we got . there in the end. I still think that women who claim they can find their . G-spot during a one-night stand are lying. Once we'd found my G-spot, . my sex life did improve, but I still didn't orgasm every time we had . sex. 'To be honest, even when you know where it is, the G-spot can still be incredibly elusive. I found it very frustrating.' The G-spot is supposed to be an area just a few centimetres across on the back vaginal wall . Caroline heard about the arrival of the G-shot in the UK from America, where the procedure has been available for some years. She . discovered that Professor P. K.W. Dartey, of the UK Laser Vaginal . Rejuvenation Centre in London's Harley Street, was the UK's only . cosmetic gynaecologist approved to administer the shot. 'I was reading these flyers which detailed the G-shot,' says Caroline. 'I . immediately thought I had to get it done. 'I attended a consultation, . where Professor Dartey explained that injecting collagen into my normal, . pea-sized G-spot would enlarge it for up to four months. The results . would mean longer, more intense orgasms. 'He showed me a . diagram of exactly where the G-spot is - between 5.8 to 6.2cm from the . pubic bone. It all sounded pretty straightforward. 'The procedure itself was a bit nerve-racking, though. I was petrified beforehand. 'At . one point, Professor Dartey was trying to locate my G-spot with one . hand while holding an 8cm needle filled with collagen in the other. 'I . lay on my back thinking: ""Oh God, what am I doing here?"" It didn't hurt . and Professor Dartey was very professional about it, but I can't say I . wasn't embarrassed. 'Five minutes later though, I was up and . dressed, and to my surprise feeling vaguely aroused, but I think that . was more because of the anticipation of the sex that I'd have later.' Caroline was told she had to wait four hours before having sex, and so spent the afternoon shopping. 'When we did have sex I'm happy to report it was just unbelievable - and it's been the same every time since.' Caroline was so happy with the results that she immediately booked in to . have a top-up treatment four months later and says she'll carry on . having the jab indefinitely. 'I'll treat it in the same way . as I do getting my hair cut or my highlights done,' she says. 'Christopher and I always had a healthy sex life, but now it's better . than ever.'

"The biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered from one site is causing scientists to reconsider the path of human evolution. They reveal how Neanderthals, our sister species, developed their distinctive teeth before their brains, using them as a third hand for holding objects. The new study adds to theories that the Neanderthals evolved their characteristic looks slowly, and intermittently, over hundreds of thousands of years. Scroll down for video . Neanderthals’ trademark facial features took shape as a first step in their evolution, while their other defining features came along later, and not all at once, researchers have reported . The ancient skulls, dating back 400,000 years, . show Neanderthal-like features in the face and teeth, while other parts . of the skulls, including the brain case, resembled those of more . primitive human ancestors. This suggests the earliest Neanderthals used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects. The discovery at the Sima de los Huesos site in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated. Juan-Luis Arsuaga, a paleontologist at the Complutense University of Madrid, claims the findings were consistent with a 'Game of Thrones' evolutionary saga. The discovery of the skulls at the Sima de los Huesos site in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated . Juan-Luis Arsuaga, a paleontologist at the Complutense University of Madrid claims the findings were consistent with a 'Game of Thrones' evolutionary saga. A scene from the TV series is shown here . In this scenario communities of humans, equivalent to 'houses' in the sci-fi series, would compete for habitable areas more than 400,000 years ago. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred. These . 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and . diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, . it is not all bad news, as other genes we inherited from our species' early life could have improved our immunity to diseases which were . common at the time, helping humans to survive. Speaking . to MailOnline, professor Chris Stringer, research leader in human . origins at the Natural History Museum in London, said: 'We got a quick . fix to our own immune system by breeding with Neanderthals which helped . us to survive. 'Studies have . also already been published which show that humans outside of Africa . are more vulnerable to Type 2 diabetes, and that is because we bred with . Neanderthals, while those who stayed inside Africa didn't.' Last . year researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities announced that . genes thought to be risk factors in cancer had been discovered in the . Neanderthal genome, and in January Nature magazine published a paper . from Harvard Medical School suggesting that a gene which can cause . diabetes in Latin Americans came from Neanderthals. Study lead author Juan-Luis Arsuaga, said: ‘The Middle Pleistocene was a long period, of about half a million years, during which hominin evolution didn’t proceed through a slow process of change with just one kind of hominin quietly evolving towards the classic Neanderthal.’ Co-author of the study published in Science, Ignacio Martinez, Professor of Paleontology at the University of Alcalá, added: ‘With the skulls we found it was possible to characterise the cranial morphology of a human population of the European Middle Pleistocene for the first time.’ Around 400,000 to 500,000 years ago, archaic humans split off from other groups of that period living in Africa and East Asia, ultimately settling in Eurasia. Once settled, they evolved characteristics that would come to define the Neanderthal lineage. Several hundred thousand years later, modern humans - who had evolved in Africa - settled in Eurasia. They interbred with the Neanderthals, but showed signs of reproductive incompatibility. Because of this, modern humans eventually replaced Neanderthals. The degree of divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans over such a short period of time has long puzzled scientists. It has, until now, been difficult to fill in the gaps because the European fossil record is isolated and dispersed. However, samples at the Sima de los Huesos site are different. Professor Arsuaga said: ‘What makes the Sima de los Huesos site unique is the extraordinary and unprecedented accumulation of hominin fossils there; nothing quite so big has ever been discovered for any extinct hominin species-including Neanderthals.’ Professor Martinez added: ‘This site has been excavated continuously since 1984. Pictured is the discovery of one of the skulls in Spain's 'Cave of Bones'. Ignacio Martinez, Professor of Paleontology at the University of Alcalá, said: 'With the skulls we found it was possible to characterise the cranial morphology of a human population of the European Middle Pleistocene for the first time' The ancient skulls (a specimen pictured) show a mix of Neanderthal and more primitive traits, suggesting Neanderthals evolved their defining characteristics in stages. This so-called 'mosaic pattern' of development supports a theory of Neanderthal evolution that suggests they developed their features separately . The Atapuerca Mountains, where the skulls were unearthed, is in the Spanish province of Burgos and near Atapuerca and Ibeas de Juarros . ‘After 30 years, we have recovered nearly 7,000 human fossils corresponding to all skeletal regions of at least 28 individuals. 'This extraordinary collection includes 17 fragmentary skulls, many of which are very complete.’ The 17 skulls belong to a single population of a fossil hominin species. Some of have been studied before, but seven are presented anew here, and six are more complete than ever before. With these intact samples at their fingertips, the researchers made progress characterising defining features. The researchers’ skull samples showed Neanderthal features present in the face and teeth, but not elsewhere. Crucially, many of the Neanderthal-derived features the researchers observed were related to chewing, and possibly holding objects with their teeth as a 'third hand.' Professor Arsuaga said: ‘It seems these modifications had to do with an intensive use of the frontal teeth. ‘The incisors show a great wear as if they had been used as a third hand,’ typical of Neanderthals.’ He added: ‘Finding a single tooth is a great success in any other site of comparable age, so imagine what it is like to painstakingly reconstruct 17 skulls - it’s like finding a treasure.’ Around 400 to 500 thousand years ago, archaic humans split off from other groups of that period living in Africa and East Asia, ultimately settling in Eurasia. Once settled, they evolved characteristics that would come to define the Neanderthal lineage. Pictured is what a Neanderthal may have looked like . A reconstruction of one of the skulls is shown here. The extraordinary collection includes 17 fragmentary skulls, many of which are almost complete . Pictured is australopithecus afarensis - an extinct hominid that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago.

"A prehistoric fish that swam the oceans more than 500 million years ago may explain how vertebrates evolved jaws. The ancient creature had bulging eyes and a narrow, tapering body, measuring about two-and-a-half inches long. Despite being small, the fish has caused a stir among scientists who say it fills in a key piece of the jigsaw in the evolution of humans - particularly how we came to get our jawbone. A prehistoric fish (illustrated left) called Metaspriggina walcotti that swam the oceans more than 500 million years ago. Over 100 fossils (one pictured right) were unearthed which could help scientists explain how vertebrates evolved jaws . Previously, only two incomplete specimens of Metaspriggina walcotti - one of the earliest known and most primitive fish - had been discovered. Until now, only two incomplete specimens . of the primitive fish, known as Metaspriggina walcotti had been discovered. The recent haul of a hundred new specimens were found in the Canadian Rockies. The prehistoric that swam the oceans more than 500 million years ago. The latest fossils show a well-preserved arrangement of muscles showing the fish was . an active swimmer - not unlike a trout. It saw the world through a pair of large eyes and sensed the surrounding environment with nasal structures. But now a hundred new ones have been dug up at two sites in the Canadian Rockies, allowing researchers to produce an animated video of how the creature would have looked and moved. The new fossils of Metaspriggina are remarkably well-preserved with the arrangement of muscles showing the fish was an active swimmer - not unlike a trout. It saw the world through a pair of large eyes and sensed the surrounding environment with nasal structures. Professor Simon Conway Morris, of Cambridge University, said: ‘The detail is stunning. Even the eyes are beautifully preserved and clearly evident.’ Professor Jean-Bernard Caron, of Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto said the new fish fossils show shows pairs of exceptionally well-preserved arches near the front of Metaspriggina's body. The first of these - closest to the head - eventually led to the evolution of jaws in vertebrates, which is the first time this feature has been seen so early in the fossil record. Fish fossils from the Cambrian period, around 500 million years ago, are very rare and usually poorly preserved. This new discovery shows in unprecedented detail how some of the earliest vertebrates developed. They led to later fish species, dinosaurs and mammals such as horses and even humans. The specimens catalogued in the journal Nature were recovered from several locations including the world famous Burgess Shale site in British Colombia. The specimens catalogued in the journal Nature were recovered from several locations including the world famous Burgess Shale site in British Colombia (marked on the map as 'A') They shed new light on the Cambrian ‘explosion’ - a period of rapid evolution starting around 540 million years ago - when most major species of animals originated. The fossils show for the first time how a series of rod-like structures known as the gill or branchial arches were arranged in the earliest vertebrates. These have long been known to have played a vital role in the evolution of vertebrates - including the origin of jaws - and some of the tiny bones in the ear, which transmit sound in mammals. It’s the ‘branchial’ arches which makes the discovery so important for scientists. The front pair is slightly thicker and this subtle distinction could be the very first step in an evolutionary change that led to the jaw. Professor Conway Norris said: ‘Once the jaws have developed the whole world opens. Having a hypothetical model swim into the fossil record like this is incredibly gratifying.’ Professor  Caron explained that the discovery will help in understanding our own origins and the fossil sites have superb potential for revealing fascinating insights into the early evolution of many other animals. He said: ‘Obviously jawed fish came later but this is like a starting post - everything is there and ready to go.’","Fossils belong to a 500-million-year old fish called Metaspriggina walcotti .

"Fewer than one in five people are now smokers, the lowest level since records began. The proportion of people lighting up has more than halved since the 1970s, as Britain kicks the habit. And despite the rise in popularity of e-cigarettes, they are most popular with people who are still smokers instead of those who have given up. The proportion of people who smoke in Britain has more than halved from 46 per cent in 1974 to 19 per cent in 2013 . According to the Office for National Statistics found that fewer people have taken up smoking and more of those who did smoke have since quit. In 2013 just 19 per cent of people in Britain were smokers, the first time it has fallen below 20 per cent and more than half the 46 per cent in 1974. The ONS said: ‘Unemployed people, those with more routine jobs, lower levels of educational achievement and lower incomes were more likely to be cigarette smokers than others. ‘Married people, those with high levels of academic achievement and older people were all less likely to be cigarette smokers than others.’ Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Britain, accounting for 80,000 deaths in England each year alone. Smoking related illnesses are said to cost the NHS more than £5billion-a-year. One in 20 people under-35 admitted to hospital in 2011-12 had problems linked to smoking. In the last 40 years the proportion of people who have never smoked has risen sharply, from 37 per cent to 58 per cent. The increase was most striking among men, aged 50-59 where the proportion who had never smoked more than tripled from 17 per cent to 55 per cent. At the same time the proportion of cigarette smokers who had quit doubled between 1974 and 2013, from 27 per cent to 54 per cent. In recent years, e-cigarettes have emerged as a high profile alternative to smoking, marketed as a way to kick the habit. But the data shows that they are most popular amongst people who still smoke. More than 1 in 10 (12 per cent) of cigarette smokers also used e-cigarettes, compared with 1 in 20 (5 per cent) ex-smokers and almost none of those who had never smoked. The ONS said: ‘E-cigarettes were found to be used mainly as smoking cessation aids and for the perceived health benefits (compared with smoking tobacco). ‘Over half of e-cigarette users said that their main reason for using e-cigarettes was to stop smoking, and about one in five said the main reason for their use was because they thought they were less harmful than cigarettes.’","Just 19% of people in Great Britain smoke, down from 46% in 2014 .

'I, of course, was directing my remarks at a legacy of issues and not the workers in ASC whom I consider to be world class.' With fears the $40 billion plus program will be lost to South Australia in favour of submarines built overseas, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten moved a censure motion against the Defence Minister in parliament, which was defeated but called on the Prime Minister to remove Senator Johnston from cabinet. Mr Abbott appeared to cut his minister loose by throwing his support behind the Australian submarine makers. He said the ASC played a vital role in supporting the navy. 'Whilst ASC has had challenges meeting the government's cost and schedule expectations of the Air Warfare Destroyer program, we are working closely with ASC on a reform strategy to improve shipyard performance and productivity,' the Prime Minister said in a statement on Wednesday. 'It is early days, but the government is confident that ASC and its partners will successfully turn the corner on this important build.' He said ASC had transformed its submarine maintenance program over the past year and exceeded navy-set targets. There are growing fears that Australia's next fleet of submarines will not be produced locally . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten moved a censure motion against the Defence Minister in parliament, which was defeated but called on the Prime Minister to remove Senator Johnston from cabinet . The Defence Minister David Johnston had earlier sparked a furore, telling parliament that the government-owned shipbuilder was $350 million over budget on a project to construct three air warfare destroyers for the navy. 'You wonder why I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe,' he said. The heated exchange came amid debate about whether the government will honour a promise to build a dozen new submarines in Australia, or buy them from overseas. Labor Senate leader Penny Wong accused the minister of trashing the reputation of the submarine corporation. 'This is a defence minister who is ... happy to undermine confidence in Australia's naval capability. He is a disgrace,' she said. 'This is a man who has insulted thousands of hard working Australians.' Senator Wong added that she had serious doubts over whether Senator Johnston would treat an Australian bid to build new submarines fairly. Under pressure internally and externally, Mr Johnston has tried to qualify his comments: 'I, of course was directing my remarks at a legacy of issues and not the workers in ASC whom I consider to be world class.' Senator Johnston said successive governments have faced frustrations in establishing a world class submarine capability. Under pressure internally and externally, Mr Johnston has tried to qualify his comments: 'I, of course was directing my remarks at a legacy of issues and not the workers in ASC whom I consider to be world class.'

"Strolling hand-in-hand on a summer’s afternoon, they look like a couple without a care in the world. But this is the married co-founder of online fashion emporium ASOS, which counts the Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister’s wife Samantha Cameron as customers. The woman by Nick Robertson’s side is his former PA Charlotte Balin – 15 years his junior – and together they have set up home just a short distance from his estranged wife. Nick Robertson (pictured left and right) has moved in with his former PA Charlotte Balin (left), just around the corner from his estranged wife Janine (right, pictured before their split) It was announced in March that Mr Robertson, 46, one the UK’s richest men, had parted from Janine, his wife of ten years. He was said to have left the £8.3 million six-bedroom property in Wimbledon, South-West London, that he shared with Mrs Robertson, 41, and their two daughters. At the time, friends said the couple were living apart on civilised terms and were trying to make their marriage work. But now it has emerged that Mr Robertson is renting a five-bedroom house with Ms Balin, 31, in Wimbledon, close to his former family home. It is understood that divorce proceedings have begun. She declined to comment when approached by The Mail on Sunday. Earlier this year, it was suggested the couple had drifted apart because the tycoon had been travelling a lot due to work commitments. But now a source has told The Mail on Sunday that Mrs Robertson is hurt, angry and feels betrayed by her husband. ‘The marriage only ended a few months ago and now Nick is moving into a property so close. They might as well have set up home at the bottom of the garden,’ a source said. Home sweet home?: Mrs Robertson is said to be hurt, angry and feels betrayed by her husband after he moved into this rented property with his PA . Mr Robertson founded ASOS – which stands for As Seen On Screen – with friend Quentin Griffiths in 2000. Specialising in clothing and accessories, it rapidly became a £2 billion global company. The Duchess of Cambridge, Samantha Cameron and First Lady Michelle Obama have all worn ASOS’s own-label designs, helping the company to achieve annual sales of £770 million. The great-grandson of retailer Austin Reed, Mr Robertson is said to be worth £448 million and his wife would be likely to get a large chunk of his fortune. However, because most of his wealth is tied up in the business, there are fears that any divorce settlement that forces Mr Robertson to sell part of his 9.28 per cent stake in the business could rock its share price. It would be the latest in a series of blows for the retailer, which has issued two profits warnings this year and suffered a suspected arson attack at its main distribution centre. Its share price has dropped 65 per cent since March, wiping almost £4 billion off its value. A spokesman for Mr Robertson and Miss Balin said Mr Robertson moved out of the family home last October but neither he nor Miss Balin wished to comment.","Nick Robertson believed to have moved out of family home in Wimbledon .

"From single colour eating to the 'drip diet' and wheatgrass shots, bizarre slimming crazes are par for the course in Tinseltown. But there's a new fat-buster on the block, and this time, there are  no oddball eating habits in sight. The new A-list diet aid of choice is the green coffee pill, which is believed to help suppress the appetite as well as encouraging fat burning. Slender: The petite Demi Moore is rumoured to be using green coffee bean pills to control her weight . Already believed to be using the pills . are Demi Moore, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry, while the rest of the Los . Angeles glitterati are set to follow suit . The pill, sold under the trade name Verdesse in the UK, is made from unripe coffee bean extract, and contains no caffeine - unlike green tea. Instead, the beans contain chlorogenic acids, including one that happens to be a potent natural fat-buster called 5-caffeoylquinic acid. 'My clients have been going crazy for green coffee bean pills,' a well-respected Hollywood nutritionist revealed in an interview with Grazia magazine. 'They're taking Tinseltown by storm. In the run-up to the Oscars, actresses do almost anything to look as slender as possible and they're all fighting it out to have the best body on the red carpet. 'As soon as this pill got a name for itself as being the new miracle weight loss tablet, word spread like wildfire among the Hollywood elite. 'You're supposed to take 800mg a day but some are taking 1,600mg and insisting ""it can't do any harm"".' Competitive: . According to one nutritionist, awards season pressure to be the . slimmest is behind the rise of green coffee bean pills among Hollywood . actresses . Tinseltown trend: Pills made from green coffee beans are believed to be popular among Hollywood slimmers . Inexpensive: The green coffee bean pills cost just £14.95 from UK supplier, Nature's Best . Although taking double the correct dose isn't recommended, there is some evidence to support green coffee's fat-busting reputation. A study conducted by scientists from the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania found that taking the pills can help boost weight-loss by an impressive 10 per cent - even when taken in relatively low doses. Joe Vinson, who led the study, said: 'Based on our results, taking multiple capsules of green coffee extract a day — while eating a low-fat, healthful diet and exercising regularly — appears to be a safe, effective, inexpensive way to lose weight.' But not everyone agrees with Vinson, and a significant number of health professionals have come forward to outline the downsides of green coffee bean pills which can include anxiety and high blood pressure. 'Side effects can include anxiety, high . blood pressure and IBS [irritable bowel syndrome],' says Romi Polichino, a London-based nutritionist. 'People have . suffered from any of these things, or panic attacks and epilepsy, . shouldn't take them.' Worse, suppliers outside of Europe and the USA are relatively uncontrolled and some have been found to substitute cheap ephedrine for the expensive coffee extract. 'The quality of these pills can vary,' adds Polichino. 'You can buy them cheaply online but who knows what's in them? I've heard that lots of them have fillers added to bulk them out. Banned in the UK, ephedrine is a substance that acts similarly to cocaine when ingested, leaving the user with a racing pulse and making them hyperactive, while also suppressing the appetite. But even without the potential for ephedrine contamination, nutritionists are concerned that the pills will become popular with women who don't need to lose weight - and will suffer as a result. 'Women who are already slim shouldn't be taking these pills,' says Polchino. 'In my view, more rigorous research needs to be carried out before we start putting them in our mouths.

"Ready to act: The European Central Bank, led by President Mario Draghi (above), has cut eurozone interest rates to a record low of 0.5% in a bid to stimulate growth . Interest rates in the eurozone were slashed to a record low yesterday in a desperate effort to drag the region out of recession. The European Central Bank cut benchmark borrowing costs to 0.5 per cent, having held them at 0.75 per cent since July last year. It follows weeks of deterioration in the eurozone including a surge in unemployment to an all-time high of more than 19.2million – 12.1 per cent of the workforce – and figures yesterday showed the downturn in manufacturing deepened in April. Germany’s factory output fell for the first time this year as the rot spread to the region’s biggest economy, but French manufacturers were the worst performing in the single currency bloc, in yet another setback to Socialist President Francois Hollande. The decline in recent weeks, and the ECB’s latest attempt to reverse it, makes a mockery of claims by senior bureaucrats in Brussels that the  crisis is over. Jose Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, provoked scorn early this year by claiming the euro was out of the danger zone. The single currency fell in value yesterday as ECB President Mario Draghi warned that ‘weak economic sentiment has extended into the spring of this year’. He added: ‘The cut in interest rates should contribute to support a recovery later in the year.’ But analysts said the measure will do little to stimulate growth and warned that the eurozone faces at least another year of decline. David Buik, a senior commentator at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said the cut was ‘too little too late’. Interest rates in Britain have been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. The move comes amid fears the eurozone economy may not recover later in the year from its recession. In theory, a cut helps companies by lowering borrowing costs for banks that have borrowed from the ECB so they could loan more. False hope? Economists warn the cut may not have much direct effect since banks are not passing on low rates in indebted countries like Cyprus (above) that need help the most . It also signals the ECB's willingness to support the economy. Economists, however, warn this cut may not have much direct effect since banks are not passing on low rates in indebted countries like Greece, Spain and Cyprus that need help the most. The cut was widely expected after Draghi said last month the bank stood ready to act. Economic data over the last month has bolstered the case for action, with unemployment hitting a record high in April, when inflation saw its biggest monthly drop in over four years, to 1.2 per cent. 'The ECB is playing it safe, even though they know the effect is likely to be limited,' Nordea analyst Anders Svendsen said of the cut. 'The key for the market is the tone. If the ECB comes out with other measures as well to help SME (small and mid-sized enterprise) lending that will be positive but if they say the cut was all they had, I think there will be disappointment.' The euro rose to $1.3191 and German 10-year government bond futures edged higher after the decision. The sharp drop in inflation, from 1.7 per cent in March, pressured the ECB to cut rates to honour its mandate to deliver price stability, which it defines as inflation close to but below 2 per cent. The sudden slump in price pressures has also raised the possibility of the ECB having to look at policy tools beyond interest rates to counter any further slide in inflation. 'Ultimately, we think the ECB will have to purchase private-sector assets in order to fix the transmission mechanism,' said Andrew Bosomworth at PIMCO, the world's largest bond fund. The ECB wants to improve the transmission of its monetary policy so its low rates reach all corners of the eurozone. The bloc's south is not benefiting to the same extent as the north from the ultra-low rates. If they are lending at all, banks there are charging companies and households more for loans than their peers in the north because of higher funding costs and credit risks. Resistance: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week the ECB would have to raise rates if it were looking at Germany alone . The ECB has repeatedly voiced its concern about the impact this has on lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have little alternative to bank funding and are a key engine for growth in the currency bloc. It has said it is studying options to address the problem, but little is expected to have been decided at Thursday's policy meeting. It is one of two that the ECB holds outside of Frankfurt each year. 'We suspect that the ECB will avoid making any formal statement on a potential SME programme ... as it continues to weigh the pros and cons of such measures,' said Frederik Ducrozet, senior euro zone economist at Credit Agricole CIB. Some ECB policymakers are reluctant to try to fix too many of the euro zone's problems, eager to push onto governments the issue of dealing with SME lending. Draghi must balance this reluctance with the pressure for action. In Germany, the ECB has even faced resistance to a rate cut. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week the ECB would have to raise rates if it were looking at Germany alone. German insurers and the county's dominant savings and cooperative banking sector have also joined up to speak out against looser ECB monetary policy, saying it would have little economic impact and undermined savings needed to protect the country's rapidly ageing population.","Move comes after inflation drops to 1.2%, well below ECB's target of 2% .

"No surprises: Sir Michael Wilshaw does not want snap Ofsted visits - despite failures being revealed . Ofsted's chief inspector has stood by his decision to rule out snap school inspections - despite downgrading two-thirds of those which had surprise visits since September. Twenty-three of the 35 schools lost at least one grade - and 11 were rapped for failing to teach pupils about other cultures in modern, multicultural Britain. But Sir Michael Wilshaw told Education Secretary Nicky Morgan there were still 'logistical drawbacks' to the shock visits and they should not become routine. 'This exercise has confirmed that we have the regional intelligence and the appropriate powers to conduct inspections without notice where serious concerns have been identified,' he wrote. 'Nevertheless, inspectors reported that there were logistical drawbacks to inspecting without notice because of difficulties in effectively engaging with school leaders, governors and parents. 'This view is consistent with Ofsted's previous consultations on the use of no-notice inspection and supports my decision that we should not move to routine no-notice inspections for all schools.' Sir Michael's vow, first made last month, appeared to be a dramatic U-turn from Ofsted's previous stance. The inspection body had pledged a clampdown which could include visits prompted by parents' complaints as recently as this year. And it comes despite the most recent surprise inspections revealing failings at more than 20 schools across England. The 35 schools were visited with no warning in September and October because of 'serious concerns' about standards, behaviour, discipline, leadership or the breadth of the curriculum. In  11  the inspectors found pupils were 'not being well prepared for life in modern Britain' - meaning they were not being taught enough about other religions or cultures. Some of the schools were not doing enough to promote 'pupils’ awareness and tolerance of communities different to their own', the inspectors added. Michael Gove first pushed for schools to promote 'British values' in 2012 and the government launched new, stronger regulations in the summer to crack down on those not seen as doing enough. The list of 11 includes Catholic, Church of England and non-denominational schools, and one Jewish high school. Sir Michael, pictured on a previous school visit,  said 11 schools were rapped for not teaching  enough about modern  Britain. But he added it was 'nonsense' to suggest a school would be marked down for being 'too white' One community primary school in the market town of Chippenham, Wiltshire, was criticised despite inspectors admitting the 'vast majority of pupils are from a White British background'. They told teachers at Stanton St Quintin Primary they did 'not go far enough in making pupils aware of the rich diversity of life in modern Britain.' Durham Community Business College was told it was inadequate and students 'do not have a good grasp of other religions and faiths and are not clear enough about some of the features of modern Britain, such as democracy.' And at the Jewish Beis Yaakov High School in Salford, Greater Manchester, inspectors wrote: 'There are major gaps in students’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. 'Students are not provided with sufficient opportunities to learn about or understand people of other faiths or cultures. The school does not promote adequately students’ awareness and tolerance of communities which are different to their own. 'As a result, the school does not prepare students adequately for life in modern Britain. This means that the school is failing to give its students an acceptable standard of education.' 'Not enough of modern Britain': Stanton St Quintin Primary in the market town of Chippenham, Wiltshire . Ofsted said the Damson Wood Infant School in Solihull, West Midlands, failed to promote 'positive attitudes to school or enable pupils to have respect for other people’s cultures'. And at the Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Kent - also rated inadequate - there was not enough 'planned, high quality teaching about how differences in, for example, sexual orientation or ethnic heritages, are valued and respected, and so students are not prepared well for life in modern-day Britain.' Final say: The letter was sent to the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, pictured . Sir Michael insisted the findings were not 'political correctness'. 'It's nonsense, for example, to suggest we would mark down a school for being ""too white""', he said. 'We simply want to ensure children are receiving a good education and are being prepared for life in modern Britain. 'This is not about political correctness. It's being realistic about the diverse society we now live in. 'Above all, it's about being fair to every school we inspect - whether it's a faith school, a secular school, or whether it's located in an inner-city or rural location. 'Of course, inspectors should take proper account of the school's context but they should also apply the same high expectations of every school when it comes to preparing our young people for the world beyond the school gates.' The reports have emerged days after Ofsted threatened to close six privately-run Muslim schools it said were vulnerable to radicalisation. Sir Michael added: 'It would be wrong for inspectors to only criticise certain types of schools and not others if we find they aren't doing enough to promote respect and tolerance of others and an understanding of the core values that bind us together as a nation.' A Department for Education spokesman added: 'Our plan for education is clear that all young people should learn the knowledge, skills and values they need to prepare them for life in modern Britain. 'We want every school to promote the basic British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance for those of different faiths and beliefs. 'This ensures young people understand the importance of respect and leave school ready to play their full part in British society. 'While the vast majority of schools successfully promote these values, we will not hesitate to step in when pupils are being let down. 'The targeted use of unannounced inspections remains an important part of Ofsted's overall approach to looking at schools where there might be particular concerns.' Leadership was deemed inadequate in another 11 schools, with the chief inspector citing 'inappropriate interference in the school’s day-to-day management', 'a breakdown in relationships' between schools and governors and 'insufficient awareness of the school’s performance'. Some also had a 'lack of financial transparency', which has been reported to the authorities. *Criticism not in Ofsted report (or report not public), but confirmed by Ofsted press office .","Sir Michael Wilshaw's move comes despite two-thirds being downgraded .

"A Vancouver woman who answered an ad for her stolen bike on Craigslist, turned the tables on thieves by asking to take it for a test ride and then pedaling off with it. Kayla Smith reported the theft of the $1,000 bike to police on Wednesday after it went missing, along with its heavy duty lock, at the Olympic Village. But she took justice into her own hands as soon as she saw it being offered for $300 the next day. Bike justice: Kayla Smith saw her stolen bike for sale on Craigslist, so she asked to see it and then stole it right back . ‘THIS GUY IS SELLING MY BIKE RIGHT NOW!!!’ she wrote in a post to Reddit. ‘I am not missing this opportunity waiting for a call. So I jump into action.’ ‘I called the guy up, totally played super sweet,’ the bartender told the Globe and Mail. ‘Was like, “Hi, how are you? You know, I have the day off today, why don’t I come meet you?’” The alleged thief agreed and they set up a time to meet at McDonalds so she could see the bike. As soon as she laid eyes on it, she knew . it was hers. Ms Smith had added distinctive custom features to her . bike, including special brakes. Daring: Kayla Smith asked to try the bike, then pedaled away . Back on the road: Kayla managed to get her $1,000 bike back . Distinctive: The bike had several custom features Kayla had added to it . ‘I noticed that it was my bike right . away because of the RIDE ON stickers on the frame,’ Ms Smith wrote. ‘Here is where I started thinking on my feet.’ She . told CBC News the man claimed to have bought it from his housemate, . which made her think: 'No you didn't. You stole it from me last night, . you liar.' When she . asked the alleged thief if she could take it for a ride around the . McDonald’s parking lot she said he seemed hesitant before finally caving . in and telling her: ‘Yeah but don’t take off…’ ‘My . heart was pounding and I had no idea what to do so I just got on the . bike and was like f**k this guy and started to ride,’ Ms Smith wrote. She said the thief began to look for her, but that she called a friend to drive to meet her as back up. ‘We watched the guy start to look for me and he got super freaked out and he suddenly just took off running,’ she wrote. Ms Smith returned to the thief’s original ad and realized he was selling several other bikes, as well as iPhones. She took down his number and reported it, along with her own amusing tale, to Crime Stoppers. Vancouver police spokesman Constable Brian Montague told Mail Online they have been unable to make an arrest so far in this case, adding that it was easier to prove a theft when someone was still in possession of the stolen goods. 'That is one of the reasons we would like anyone who sees their stolen property for sale on line to call police. We can work with the victim to facilitate a meeting with the seller to get their property back,' he said. 'I can't believe I just stole my bike back': The Vancouver bartender, who has made a hobby of doing splits in cities all over the world, said she was terrified as she met the thief and then started to ride away . 'Not only can we help get the property . back, but also ensure the safety of the victim, immediately identify the . person responsible and request criminal charges if there is evidence to . support those charges,' he said. When CBC News contacted the number for the seller on Craigslist, the person they spoke to denied the allegations. Constable Montague added: 'You don't know who you are meeting when you make these arrangements. You don't know how desperate these people are so there is a bit of a risk.'","Vancouver bartender, says she had no time to call police when she saw her $1000 stolen bike being sold .

"Anthony Noto, who joined the company as CFO in July, appeared to be expressing his desire to buy another company in the message . Twitter's own chief financial officer showed that anyone can slip up when it comes to social media, when he made the classic mistake of posting a public tweet that was meant to be private direct message. Anthony Noto, who joined the company as CFO in July, appeared to be expressing his desire to buy another company in the message, which was presumably intended for a fellow Twitter executive. It read: 'I still think we should buy them. He is on your schedule for Dec 15 or 16 - we will need to sell him. I have a plan.' Mr Noto deleted the message soon after it was posted, but not before a number of his 9,300 followers took screengrabs and shared the failed tweet - prompting speculation as to which company the CFO could possibly have been talking about. NBC pointed out that the last tweet favorited by Mr Noto was from Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, who reportedly turned down a $3 billion cash offer from Facebook in 2013. The news site also felt it worth noting that a number of the accounts recently followed by Noto feature employees from a news startup aimed at young people called Mic. It is not unusual for Twitter to acquire smaller firms that create features for the site. Technology news site  Re/code suggested a number of possible purchase targets for Twitter including the selfie app Shots and anonymous social app Secret. It also pointed to Drawbridge - a startup that helps brands monitor consumers and target them with advertising - as a potential target for Mr Noto, while Storehouse, Prismatic and Shopular also featured on their list. Mr Noto was previously a technology banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc and created an account for the social media site in 2009. Twitter has not commented on his post.

"Rosie Skinner gets through at least two large sponges a week. But rather than scrubbing her car or cleaning her bathroom, the 19-year-old is addicted to eating them. The teenager has suffered the strange addiction since she was five years old. A student from Epson, Surrey, Miss Skinner cuts the sponges into small pieces and sucks on them throughout the day, in the same way most teenagers snack on chocolate or crisps. Pica is the name given to a condition in which people eat objects which are not suitable to be consumed and have no nutritional value. Rosie Skinner, 19, craves eating sponges and gets through around two a week. 'I have always loved the smell of a wet sponge. I crave that damp taste and feeling in my mouth,' she says . Miss Skinner now eats at least two large sponges a week (pictured right). At 10 years old (pictured left) she lost her tooth in a sponge, and at 13 had surgery to remove a big ball of sponge from her stomach . Miss Skinner (pictured left) says she doesn't feel confident revealing her habit around other people. Her family, and boyfriend Callum, 18 (pictured right) say she is 'mad' People have been known to eat dirt, glass, pain and sand, as well as household objects like carpets, candles and sponges. Miss Skinner, who attends Reigate Sixth Form College, said: 'I have always loved the smell of a wet sponge. 'I crave that damp taste and feeling in my mouth. 'I like the texture as well, it's a bit like eating cake. 'I might try one with some icing on one day. If I have a stressful day I love to treat myself to snack on a sponge to relax.' Pica can cause a range of serious complications if the person eats something that is poisonous or indigestible. And in Miss Skinner's case the bizarre habit has resulted in her being admitted to hospital. When she was 13, she had to have an operation to remove a large ball of sponge from her stomach. Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value. These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt. It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious complications if the patient is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible. She said: 'It was a bit of a weird situation. I started having stomach aches and then they developed into really severe pains. 'I was rushed to hospital where doctors removed a ball the size of a small mouse from my stomach. 'The doctor's said it was a bit weird and they told me to stop eating sponge. 'I tried to do what the doctors told me, but I can't fight my cravings entirely. Now I just chew it for a while and spit it out.' Miss Skinner also once lost a tooth in a sponge when she was ten years old. She said: 'I was eating a sponge and my tooth came out in it. It took me a while to explain to my mum why it was in a sponge.' Miss Skinner, who favourite sponges are those available at hardware store Wilko, said she is trying to kick the habit for good. She said: 'I even take little sandwich bags to college with pieces of sponge in it so I can eat it during my lectures. 'I would like to quit, but I still haven't grown out of the habit yet. 'I thought about buying a proper luxury sponge from the sea, but that would be taking things too far. 'I'm not very confident doing it around people - I know it's weird. 'My family and my boyfriend, Callum, think I'm mad, but I don't mind, it's just part of who I am.' Doctors told Miss Skinner to stop eating sponges, but she finds it difficult to resist the cravings. If she has a stressful day, she likes to snack on a sponge to relax . 'I would like to quit, but I still haven't grown out of the habit yet,' Miss Skinner says . In August MailOnline reported the story of two sisters from Bradford who regularly eat candles and second-hand books. Adele, 50, began eating candles as a child. She now eats around two inches of wax every day, much like many people tuck into a chocolate bar. She says candles are an emotional crutch - and the 300 she has eaten in her lifetime have apparently never caused her any health problems. 'When I was eight or nine I started sniffing fire lighters,' she told ITV's This Morning. 'I then started nibbling on candles and have done ever since.' For her twin sister Anita, also 50, Pica struck later in life - when she was pregnant 24 years ago. 'I began having cravings for things that smelled like old bus tickets,' she told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes. 'When I found the smell again, it was in an old book - and I haven't been able to stop since. 'The older the book, the better it tastes. I just love really old books. It's like eating a chocolate bar.' She now scours charity shops looking for ripe old tomes - and is unbothered by the germs and dust they may be harbouring. Sisters Anita (left) and Adele (right), both 50, from Bradford, regularly eat candles and second-hand books.
