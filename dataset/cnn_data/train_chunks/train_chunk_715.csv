Controversial: Lord Neuberger, president of the Supreme Court, says short sentences are bad for criminals . One of the country’s  most senior judges provoked fury last night when he criticised short jail sentences for interfering with the home lives of criminals. Lord Neuberger, president of the Supreme Court, said he rejected the idea that a couple of months behind bars – and what he called ‘the clang of the prison gates’ – could help bring criminals to their senses. Instead, he warned such sentences ‘can be disruptive’ for the prisoner’s job and home life. The judge made his comments after visiting Holloway women’s prison in North London. He also expressed concern that prisoners there were forced to share a cell, when ‘the vast majority’ would, he said, prefer to have a room to themselves. Bizarrely, he also complained about ‘bossy notices’ on prison walls, and the cheap furniture he saw in the jail, and expressed astonishment at how little money was spent on prisoners’ food. His comments raised concerns that a senior member of the judiciary appeared to be intervening in highly political debate around sentencing policy. Critics accused the judge of seeing things ‘entirely from the point of view of the criminal’ and failing to consider victims. Ministers defended short sentences as ‘effective’. His comments came in an article for the November issue of Independent Monitor, the magazine for prison monitoring boards, after a visit to Holloway in North London earlier this year. In the year to March 2013, a total of 18,724 criminals were given jail sentences of between three and six months. Another 25,165 were given jail terms of up to three months. The judge wrote: ‘As a judge one message I took away was the highly questionable value of short sentences.’ ‘The notion that a couple of months in prison will help bring a defendant to her senses, the so-called “clang of the prison gates”, has always had a real resonance for me.' Tory MP Douglas Carswell blasted the judge's comments, saying: 'Of course a prison sentence is going to disrupt the life of the criminal. That's the ruddy idea, your honour' He added: ‘But, following my visit to Holloway, having listened to the probation officers and others, I have a very different perspective. A short prison sentence can be disruptive for the prisoner’s job, home etc. 'And on the other hand, if an offender needs help for any reason, such as substance abuse or training for a job, there is no point in her being in prison for much less than six months.’ He added: ‘My other impressions included concern that most prisoners were required to share a cell when the great majority wished to be on their own; astonishment that prisoners could be fed sensibly for under £2 a day.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell criticised the judge's comments, claiming many of his constituents want to see longer sentences for criminals . But it was his comments on sentencing which provoked dismay – as he appeared to stray into political territory. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘What a surprise! A senior official in the criminal justice system sees things entirely from the point of view of the criminal. Until we democratise the appointment process for judges, judges are never going to be on our side. ‘Of course a prison sentence is going to disrupt the life of the criminal – that’s the ruddy idea, your honour. In my constituency, there are people who would say that if short sentences are a problem, just make them longer.’ Criminal justice expert Peter Cuthbertson, the director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘It’s a huge mistake to view sentencing only from the point of view of criminals, without thinking of their many potential victims. ‘Even short sentences can give communities a respite from hardened criminals. Putting away serious, repeat offenders for even a few months can prevent dozens of crimes. But longer prison sentences do have a much better record for cutting reoffending. If Lord Neuberger thinks short sentences don’t do the job, figures show we should use prison for longer rather than not at all.’ Defenders of the use of short jail sentences point out most criminals will have been given several community sentences and other ‘soft’ punishments before they merit a jail term. Almost 8,000 criminals jailed last year had been given at least 11 community sentences. Last night, Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said short sentences ‘can be an effective punishment for some criminals’. A Supreme Court spokesman said: ‘Lord Neuberger was simply reporting informal conversations he had with probation officers and other prison staff during his visit to Holloway Prison in July. His reflections of their views on short term sentences are in no way intended as official statements of sentencing policy, which are matters for the Sentencing Council and Parliament. ‘Judges balance a wide range of factors when considering appropriate sentences, including the impact the crime has had on victims and the interests of wider society.’ In March Lord Neuberger rebuked Home Secretary Theresa May for criticising judges who fail to deport foreign criminals . Earlier this year Lord Neuberger refused to answer journalists’ questions at a press conference, warning that it was inappropriate for judges to give opinions publicly on solely political matters. But as the 65-year-old has settled into his role as President of the Supreme Court, which he took up in October last year, he has made a series of interventions in sensitive political territory. Earlier this year he said legal aid cuts would bring lawlessness – warning  that restricting rights to free lawyers would ‘lead to people taking the law in to their own hands’. In March he rebuked Home Secretary Theresa May for criticising judges who fail to deport foreign criminals. He said Mrs May’s comments were ‘inappropriate, unhelpful and wrong’. He was previously the most senior critic of the decision to abolish the Law Lords and create the Supreme Court, which he now heads. He described Tony Blair’s decision to go ahead with the reform as ‘verging on the frivolous’. Last month, he spoke out to praise the Daily Mail for exposing the secret jailing of a woman who was trying to take her father out of a care home because she feared for his safety. In April, the Mail revealed 50-year-old Wanda Maddocks had been handed a five-month jail term by the Court of Protection – the secretive court which controls the affairs of people who are too ill to make their own decisions. The judge said he applauded the reporting of the case, adding: ‘I think that one of the important functions of an open society is that the Press and media remind us sometimes of the need to examine our practices and to see whether we do comply as much as we should with the need for open justice.’ Lord Neuberger, the son of a medical professor who fled Germany when Hitler came to power, is one of the few judges with experience outside the law. He worked for City bank N M Rothschild for three years after leaving Oxford. As Master of the Rolls, he allowed the City of London to order the Occupy protesters to move on from St Paul’s after a four-month protest. He has been highly critical of the excesses of lawyers profiting from the no-win no-fee system. Lord Neuberger has been married for 36 years to tv producer Angela Holdsworth. They have two sons and a daughter.","Lord Neuberger said a few months behind bars is not an effective deterrent .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 11:37 EST, 13 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 13 December 2013 . A North Carolina man has filed a lawsuit accusing the notorious affairs website Ashley Madison of breaking up his 13-year marriage. Robert Schindler's lawsuit, originally filed last year, names the infidelity website, its Canadian parent company, Avid Dating Life Inc, and his ex-wife's lover, Eleazar 'Chay' Montemayor. According to court documents, Montemayor, 58, a married professor of civil engineering, and Schindler’s wife, 51-year-old Teresa Moore, first met on Ashley Madison in 2007 and soon began an affair. 'Homewrecker': A spurned North Carolina husband is suing the infidelity site Ashley Madison for allegedly breaking up his 13-year marriage . Last October, Mr Montemayor and his paramour got married after divorcing their respective spouses. Schindler’s complaint cited by Charlotte Observer seeking more than $10,000 alleges that Montemayor, Ashley Madison and its parent company came between him and his wife and 'alienated and destroyed' their love. The 'other' man: Eleazar 'Chay' Montemayor, 58, a married professor of civil engineering, met Teresa Moore in 2007 on the cheating site, and the two began an affair that ended in a wedding last year . North Carolina is one of only a handful of states that still have archaic alienation of affection/criminal conversation laws on the books allowing scorned spouses to seek punitivie damages when a marriage fails due to the actions of a third party. In Schnidler's case, the cuckolded 62-year-old husband claims that the infidelity website and Montemayor alienated his wife, who then went on to have 'criminal conversation - a legal term for extramarital sex - with her paramour. Noel Biderman, the founder of the cheating portal - and a married father of two - dismissed the claims outlined in the lawsuit as nonsensical, telling the paper that his company is no more liable for someone's split than a hotel room where a tryst had taken place, or a cell phone operator who made it possible for the lovers to communicate. The former attorney and sports agent added that Ashley Madison connects people online but is no way responsible for what their clients choose to do offline. ‘I think it would be an incredibly slippery slope to attempt to espouse blame to all the technology and inanimate objects that were utilized in an affair,’ he told the paper. However, Schindler's attorney, Christopher Johnson, pointed out that Biderman's argument does not hold water because unlike a hotel room or a cell phone, which have other purposes besides fostering unfaithfulness, Ashley Madison's sole raison d'etre is to promote affairs. In fact, the company's motto prominently displayed on its homepage goads: 'Life is short. Have an affair.' Defense: Ashley Madison founder Noel Biderman said his company is no more liable for someone's split than a hotel room or a cell phone operator . The portal, which has been in operation since 2002, boasts nearly 23million members and purports to be 'the most famous name in infidelity and married dating.' 'Ashley Madison is the most successful website for finding an affair and cheating partners,' the company description claims. 'Have an Affair today on Ashley Madison. 'Thousands of cheating wives and cheating husbands sign up every day looking for an affair. We are the most famous website for discreet encounters between married individuals.' Schindler's lawsuit has ample precedent in North Carolina. In 2010, a wronged wife was awarded $9million against her husband’s mistress. The following year, a judge ruled in favor of a Raleigh businessman’s former wife who sued her replacement, awarding her the largest judgement in state history - $30million. Cheating emporium: Ashley Madison boasts nearly 23million members and purports to be 'the most famous name in infidelity and married dating' In 2009, state lawmakers passed a measure protecting employers from being sued under the alienation law since affairs often begin in the workplace. Now, legal action for breaking up a marriage can be pursued only against a 'natural person' - but Schindler's attorney said that since his client's ex-wife struck up a relationship with another man in 2007, two years before the passage of the legislation, Ashley Madison could still be on the hook for thousands of dollars.","Robert Schnidler. 62, is seeking $10,000 in damages from Ashley Madison, its parent company and his ex-wife's lover, Eleazar Montemayor .

A Major League Baseball player has been ordered to pay more child support despite just singing the fourth largest contract in leauge history. Robinson Cano, who has just joined the Seatlle Mariners for $240million (£147m), has been ordered by a judge in the Dominican Republic to pay an extra $600 a month to support his three-year-old son, Robinson Miguel, who lives there with his mother Jackelin Castro, 38. That money will form a 'provisional pension' and will be on top of the $600 he already pays in child support, but Castro says she will be going back to court and pushing for $25,000 a month. Robinson Cano, who has just singed a $240million contacts with the Mariners, has been ordered to pay an extra $600 a month in child support . However Jackelin Castro is asking for $25,000 a month in order to support their son Robinson Miguel . Speaking to the New York Daily News she said: 'It’s never consistent,We’re talking about someone who made $15 million last season. 'Robinson, the son, he doesn’t have a secure income as of now. That’s a shame.' She claims that child support and the $100 a month she receives as a pension for being a retired volleyball player, are not enough to raise the boy. She added: 'His son doesn’t even go to see his dad at games. That’s not fair to the kid. 'All I wish is that his dad was more involved in his son’s life. My son deserves better.' Cano and Castro, who were a couple between 2008 and 2011, have been embroiled in a long-running child-support dispute. In October she claimed Cano had a lawyer come to her home in February to try and get her to agree to accept $600 a month over the next 10 years, which she refused. ‘The intention of him and his advisers was somewhat to intimidate me,’ Castro told ESPN.com. Cano, who made $15 million last season, disputed the mother’s claims in a statement. Former New York Yankees star Cano, has been accused of neglecting the upkeep of his three-year-son son who lives in the Dominican Republic with the baseball player's ex-girlfriend .

I look forward to an amicable resolution that will allow me . time with my son.’ Castro has complained the Cano’s $600 a month payments are delivered sporadically by a relative and without notice. Her lawyer Wendy Diaz is demanding $25,000 a month. ‘I believe the money he gives to the son, when he does, is not enough to feed the dogs of Robinson Cano’s house,’ Diaz said. ‘Maybe he is expending more money on the dogs and cars that he has than on his own child.’ Castro has also attacked Cano's public image including the RC24 Foundation, which helps underprivileged children . Castro also attacked Cano’s public image that he conveys through his RC24 Foundation, which helps underserved children. ‘What hurts me most [is] he shows the world that he helps children, that he's a good person, he's very humane,’ she said. ‘So with something of his own, he may trick the world and everybody who sees him because he's the big star that he is, but there's a reality, which is a son who doesn't [receive] the quality of life he's supposed to.’","Robinson Cano, 31, has been ordered to pay more child support to his son .

Support: Major General Ed Davis said the Armed Forces still has a 'duty of care' towards Marine A and his family . Britain's top commando has vowed to stand by the sergeant convicted of executing a severely-wounded Taliban prisoner, declaring: 'Once a marine, always a marine.' Major General Ed Davis risked a clash with military top brass by issuing the message of support on the day the 39-year-old - identified only as Marine A - was found guilty of murder. His comments to the 8,300-strong Royal Marines are at odds with those from General Sir Nick Houghton, the head of the Armed Forces, who said there should be 'no leniency' for Marine A because of his 'heinous crime'. Maj Gen Davis, who led 3 Commando Brigade in Afghanistan at the time when the unknown captive was shot dead, said: 'We will hold true to our duty of care and responsibility for this member of the corps family, and his family, as he serves out his sentence. 'Our mantra of ""once a marine, always a marine"" is not conditional.' His stance was revealed as a poll revealed that more people believed the commando should be treated with clemency than thought he should receive a mandatory life sentence for the murder. Some 47 per cent of those quizzed by ICM agreed that Marine A should be given a shorter sentence because 'the law should make an exception for a soldier serving on the frontline'. However, 35 per cent think he should receive the full life term. Maj Gen Davis is under pressure from his officers to submit statements of mitigation to the court martial when Marine A is sentenced next month DEC. Some commanders in the marines want him to be treated like soldiers convicted of killing civilians in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, who were not dismissed from the military. This would allow the sergeant, who serves with 42 Commando, to receive his salary and his family to retain other perks. A Royal Marines officer said: 'If Marine A's family are evicted from their home and forced on to benefits, it will make them victims and cause an outcry.' Charged: Maine A was found guilty of murder after footage capturing the death of a Taliban insurgent was unearthed . His unit commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Neil Sutherland, is expected to submit an 'operational effectiveness impact statement' to the court setting out Marine A's chances of returning to duty after completing his sentence. A defence source said: 'These are usually the key to dissuading military judges from issuing sentences demanding dismissal from service, so it is very important whether the chain of command of Royal Marines says he has a future in uniform.' Marine A killed the insurgent in September 2011 near the end of a 'tour from hell', during which 23 servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade were killed and the Taliban hung the blown off limbs of maimed British troops in trees as 'trophies'. He shot the unknown man in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol, then taunted him: 'Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***.' His badly injured victim had been found with an AK47 assault rifle and grenade after an Apache helicopter blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a British base. Harrowing film and audio recordings of the 'field execution' in a cornfield, captured on a helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade, were played to a court martial. Marine A denied murder, claiming he thought the insurgent was already dead. His co-accused, known as Marine B and C, were cleared of the charge. Short sentence: Major General Julian Thompson who led the elite commandos in the Falklands War, has called for leniency when Marine A is sentenced . The commando, a 15-year veteran who had done six tours of Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, was found guilty after a two-and-a-half week trial. He is the first serviceman to be convicted of murder on active service abroad since the Second World War. Several retired commanders, including Major General Julian Thompson, who led the elite commandos in the Falklands War, have called for leniency when Marine A is sentenced. Supporters believe the seven-strong board of military personnel who decide his fate must take into account the unimaginable horror, stress and provocation he endured in the weeks leading up to the killing.","Major General Ed Davis gave his support the day Marine A was convicted .

Adrian Knopps survived for seven days in the Alaskan wilderness despite having just four granola bars for food, no warm clothing and no shelter . A Michigan hunter survived for a week in the Alaskan wilderness with just four granola bars, no shelter and no warm clothing on just three hours of sleep. Adrian Knopps, a 51-year-old electrician from Grand Ledge, ate one bar a day until he ran out, and survived a 70mph storm by lashing himself to tree roots. He also carved a farewell note on the butt of his rival in the hope that someone passing by might relay his fate to his family. Knopps became stranded in September while on a 10-day trip up the Chickamin river after his partner Garrett Hagen, 24, drowned. He survived for seven days under constant threat of being attacked by wolves and bears. Knopps eventually collapsed, suffering from hypothermia, hallucinating and on the verge of death. He prayed to God for help, and two hours later he was found by a coastguard helicopter. 'It probably was the most wonderful sound I ever heard,' he told The Detroit News. Cmdr. Pete Melnick, operations officer at the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka, added: 'It's a testament to the human will to live.' The ordeal began just three days into a 10-day hunting trip after Knopps and Hagen sailed a 50ft boat into a river delta, moored up and went ashore. Soon after Hagen shot an 800lb grizzly bear, the pair skinned it and loaded the meat on to a small skiff. Knopps agreed to stay on land while Hagen took the meat back in the smaller vessel. However, Hagen never returned. After 11 days search and rescue teams found his body 30 miles away, and believe he drowned while trying to get into the boat. Meanwhile Knopps was left in a desperate situation. His warm clothing, mobile and other supplies were all aboard the bigger boat, but with the skiff missing he had no way of getting to them without freezing to death in the ice-cold water. He also knew that, as the trip was due to last for seven days more, it would be at least that long before anyone knew he was missing or came looking for him. Knowing he was in for a long wait Knopps moved on to higher ground where he survived his way through continuous rain and a storm by lashing himself to tree roots. While he was lost Adrian says he spent a lot of time thinking about his wife, Maria (left), his two grown sons, and his granddaughter Natalie, 6 (centre) Knopps survived through constant rain and a 70mph storm on the Chickamin river by lashing his arm to a tree. He couldn't lie down because of the flooded ground and got a total of just three hours sleep . During the storm the boat, which Knopps had hoped would lead rescuers to him, broke its mooring and began to float away. He had just four granola bars for sustenance which he ate, one a day, until they were gone. He didn't lay down the entire time because the ground was sodden and slept for a total of just three hours. Knopps says he spoke aloud to God constantly and thought about his wife, two sons and granddaughter. He carved a note into the butt of his rifle in the hope that somebody would find it and pass it to his family. It said : 'A Knopps stuck on river tidal flat for 5 days. Cold wet no food. Garrett Hagen, Craig, AK died taking big bear to boat 9-15-13.' Rescuers were eventually alerted after seven days when they found Hagen's boat adrift and located Knopps several hours later . He was eventually found after the coastguard spotted the boat adrift and came looking for him, finding him barely alive with swollen joints and fingers. Now recovered, he still suffers nerve damage, which is expected to disappear in time, and cannot walk a long distance without resting. However that hasn't stopped him from going back to the forest. Two months after his rescue he went on an annual hunting trip with his brother and brother-in-law in the Wisconsin woods where he shot five deer. 'I love hunting. I love the woods,' he said.

George Zimmerman's girlfriend Samantha Scheibe was urged to dump him after friends feared she would not be able to control his temper. One friend today told MailOnline that Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer who was cleared of killing teenager Trayvon Martin, was a 'time bomb' waiting to explode. Zimmerman is due in court on Tuesday in Seminole County, Florida to face a felony charge of aggravated assault with a weapon. Scroll down to listen to the 911 call . Samantha Scheibe's friends warned her about a relationship with George Zimmerman, they told MailOnline after he was charged with domestic violence on Monday . He will also be charged with misdemeanor battery-domestic violence and criminal mischief when he makes his first appearance before a judge at Seminole County Court. Miss Scheibe, 27, was not injured during the domestic dispute which has catapulted Zimmerman back into national headlines. The pretty blonde has been dating Zimmerman for several months following the breakdown of his marriage after his acquittal for Trayvon Martin's murder. The pair had set up home at Miss Schiebe's single-story house in Seminole County. Friends of the couple said they had harbored fears that Miss Scheibe would not be able to maintain the relationship with Zimmerman. A friend of Miss Schiebe's sister Olivia said: 'I think we all knew something like this might happen. 'We would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it would end badly. He is just a time bomb waiting to go off. 'Look at all the run-ins he has had with police and his family. He has big issues.' Miss Scheibe's mother Hope was too distressed to comment when contacted by MailOnline at her home in Gainesville, Florida. The mother-of-three said: 'I really can't say anything now. It is not a good time.' A family friend said: 'Everyone is very concerned for Samantha and wants the best for her. 'Many in the family were surprised when she began dating Zimmerman. He is not her type of guy.' Miss . Scheibe had spent the last weekend in Cedar Key, Florida, with a group . of female friends including her twin sisters Allie and Olivia. Latest mugshot: George Zimmerman has been arrested again over a new domestic violence claim after his girlfriend reportedly called police following a confrontation at her home that involved a gun . They had traveled today from their home in Lakeland to comfort their sister. Zimmerman and Miss Scheibe have been living together since August. She was with him during his last arrest when his wife Shellie called police after a confrontation at her parents’ home. Miss Scheibe was not involved and was not cooperative with police refusing to make a written statement. Yesterday's altercation which led to Zimmerman's arrest began after Miss Scheibe called 911. Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger confirmed at a conference that the 27-year-old was the one to call police. 'She and George Zimmerman were having a . verbal dispute and at that time she indicated that he broke a table and . pointed a long-barreled shotgun at her,' Sheriff Eslinger said. 'She was on the phone with our dispatch, communicating as much information as she could.' He . said Zimmerman pushed her out of the home and then barricaded the front . door so that she could not re-enter, using furniture to block the . doorway. Officers arrived at the scene less than four minutes later and made verbal contact with her outside of the house. She gave them a key to the home and they went in the building to speak with Zimmerman. When they found him, he was unarmed and 'offered no resistance to deputies as they responded'. According . to the arrest report, after Miss Scheibe asked Zimmerman to pack his . things, he 'cocked the shotgun' before putting the two guns in one case. Scene: Zimmerman was arrested at his girlfriend's home on Monday afternoon, and his relatives told a local paper that he had been living at that residence for a few weeks . She told deputies he then became upset as she carried his belongings out and took out the shotgun. Miss Scheibe said she was going to call police, and Zimmerman then pointed the weapon at her for a minute and 'asked her if she really wanted to do that'. Zimmerman then smashed a glass coffee table with the gun butt and ordered Sheibe out, she told deputies. He then pushed her out and locked the door. Before police entered Zimmerman, 30, made his own 911 call telling the dispatcher he wanted the truth to come out. During the call he said his girlfriend was pregnant and they had argued. He said the row escalated after he offered to leave and allow Miss Scheibe to bring up their child on her own. He told the dispatcher his girlfriend had 'gone crazy' on him. During the six-minute call the dispatcher urged Zimmerman to talk with the officers outside. In the call he also claimed his girlfriend had smashed the table and denied threatening her with a gun. Although Zimmerman said his girlfriend was pregnant, police later confirmed that she was not. Last night Seminole County detectives carried evidence out of Miss Scheibe's rented home near Apopka, including a long black bag that was the size of a rifle. Split: George and his wife Shellie, seen here during his murder trial, formally began divorce proceedings in September and she called the police when he confronted her days later . Deputies have said they will ask for electronic monitoring of Zimmerman if he is given bond at Tuesday's hearing. Legal experts said a conviction for the felony assault with mean Zimmerman can no longer legally own a firearm. Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, when he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on February 26, 2012. The death of Trayvon, a black teenager who was unarmed by Zimmerman, a Latino, sparked protests over racial profiling across the country. Martin's family and supporters lashed out at Florida's 'stand your ground' statute, although Zimmerman's lawyers opted to rely on a self-defense argument at trial. Since being acquitted, Zimmerman has had several involvements with authorities. Zimmerman's wife Shellie moved out of their house and filed for divorce in September. She and her father accused him of threatening them with a gun as they moved her belongings out of their Lake Mary home. Police handcuffed Zimmerman but later let him go. Lake Mary police closed the case last week, saying that his wife declined to press charges and that there was no firm evidence Zimmerman had broken any laws. He also has been pulled over three times for minor traffic incidents, twice receiving warnings and once issued a speeding ticket. His trial lawyers have said they will not be representing him in any future court cases.","Zimmerman due in Florida court to face a felony charge of aggravated assault with a weapon .

The 40-year-old was knocked to the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched - before being left unconscious on the street. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Sergeant Mohammed Deen, 40, was repeatedly punched and kicked outside a restaurant in Queens. His attacker - identified police as Hayden Holder, 29 - has been remanded in custody on a felony assault charge . Sgt Deen - who has worked for the NYPD for 18 years - suffered serious injuries in the brutal assault, which was captured on a passerby's mobile phone and uploaded to Facebook. He was taken to Jamaica Hospital and has now been placed in a medically induced coma, according to the New York Post. The sickening footage shows his attacker - identified by police as Hayden Holder, 29 - repeatedly bashing Sgt Deen's head against the ground outside St John's Express restaurant on Liberty Avenue. Terrifying: Holder tries to smash the windows of Sgt Deen's parked BMW, where his horrified wife is cowering . Holder then tries to attack the Sgt Deen's terrified wife - who is cowering in the police officer's BMW sedan - by attempting to smash the car's windows. Failing to do so, Holder then returns to his unconscious victim - who is lying motionless of the ground - before continuing to punch and kick his body. 'This was a vicious, savage beating,’ said a shocked police officer who was called to the scene. Holder, from Jamaica, attempted to flee the scene, but was later arrested and charged with felony assault. He was taken to the police station in a hospital gown after being treated for injuries to his hand. Sgt Deen, who is currently assigned to the 32nd Precinct in Harlem, is believed to have argued with the thug at Maracus nightclub, about a mile away, earlier in the night. It was unclear what sparked the row - however, Facebook users have speculated that Sgt Deen accidentally bumped into Holder. Holder has been remanded in custody.

A family grieving over the sudden death aboard a cross-country flight of a 16-year-old disabled boy is outraged over an attempt to cash in on their tragedy. Zachary Bisiar, who suffered from Cerebral Palsy, died last weekend after a heart attack caused him to go into cardiac arrest 30 minutes into a flight from Seattle to Atlanta. Family members watching a news report about the boy’s death noticed a ‘donate’ button embedded in the report, but they have no idea who is taking the money donated. Zachary Bisiar, 16, who suffered from cerebral palsy, went into cardiac arrest 30 minutes after take-off from Seattle on a flight bound for Atlanta . ‘We saw a YouTube video showing a CNN report and it had a donation button at the bottom that looked like someone was using the tragedy to get money,’ uncle Steven Leahy told ABC News. The thought that someone would try to get some financial gain off this really upset me,’ he added. Mr Bisiar was flying to Atlanta with his mother, grandmother and a sibling because his step-father, an Iraq veteran, was relocated from Fort Lewis, in Washington, to Fort Hood, in Georgia. The devastated family is struggling to keep up with the costs of both the move and the funeral, so Mr Leahy set up a his own separate fundraising page where people can donate money and be sure it will reach the family. ‘I used to be in the military and I know what limited pay you get,’ said Mr Leahy. ‘There is the cost for the move.’ My brother-in-law was driving the car and bringing all their household necessities, and there was gas and lodging across country, then the tragedy hit,’ he continued. The medical examiner's office in Washington's Spokane County believe Zachary's death was due to 'a rare complication of a rare disease process. The manner of death is natural' ‘Please help my sister and her husband who lost their son, Zachary Bisiar, on flight 128 from Seattle to Atlanta,’ he writes on the GoFundMe page he has launched. ‘All proceeds will go towards laying him to rest and aiding the family with the difficult time they are having now with the loss of their child.’ The incident happened aboard Delta Flight 128, which departed Seattle around 9 a.m. local time on Saturday. The medical examiner's office in . Washington's Spokane County said on Monday that the autopsy results for . Zachary were still pending further tests. Forensic . pathologist Sally S. Aiken, with Spokane's Medical Examiner office, . noted that the cause of the boy's death is currently 'pending' further . microscopic and other studies. In . a statement, Dr. Aiken said that it was 'thought to be a rare . complication of a rare disease process. The manner of death is natural.' The plane was diverted to an airport in Spokane, Washington, after the boy suffered a medical emergency and died on board. 'It was a complete surprise - they were completely devastated,' said Spokane Fire Department spokesperson Brian Schaeffer. The family had decided to fly to Georgia rather than drive after learning of a similarly afflicted child developing complications from blood clots during a cross-country drive, Mr Leahy told ABC. The teen was cleared by doctors to fly. Washington State patient-confidentiality rules prohibit local officials from divulging such information outside of a coroner’s report, but Schaeffer did say there was nothing in his medical history to suggest such an incident was to be expected. The boy and his family were sitting at the back of the plane when they began calling for help, passenger Joe Ryan, of Atlanta, told MailOnline. Zachary's uncle Steven Leahy has launched a fundraising page to help his sister and her husband cover the expenses involved in funeral which is scheduled for December 22 . The flight crew immediately sprung into action. Despite the dire circumstances, everyone – including passengers – remained calm and collected throughout. ‘It was calm and the male flight attendants rushed to his aid at the back of the plane,’ said Ryan. ‘They started performing CPR on him… the pilot got on the air and said we are going to have an emergency landing.’ ‘We were on the ground in five minutes... I think that they did everything they could to save that boy’s life,' Ryan added. A registered nurse aboard a flight, Dan Goslin, told WSBTV that he and two other passengers, a doctor and a midwife, did everything they could to revive the boy. Medical aid: Dan Goslin, a nurse, along with a doctor and a midwife all tried desperately to save the 16-year-old boy during Saturday's flight . 'He was having trouble breathing. We tried oxygen. That didn't work. We tried to move him out of the chair and get him to another position. That didn't work and everything we tried just really didn't work,' Goslin said. Emergency personnel were already on their way when the plane touched down. ‘We met them on the ground with our fire fighter paramedics and attempted resuscitate him for well over 30 minutes,’ Schaeffer said. ‘Paramedics rushed on to the plane, you could tell there was a lot of urgency… then everything calmed down and you could put two and two together,’ Ryan lamented. The boy was pronounced dead on the plane.

Getting lost in a vast, maze-like shopping centre can turn a casual bit of retail therapy into something of a mission. But help is on the way – in the form of a navigation system designed specially for shoppers. The ‘shopnav’ system turns smartphones into miniature guides, leading users to the outlet they need via the quickest route. The system downloads three dimensional plans from the internet - and 'guides' shoppers to their destinations inside shopping malls . There are several competing systems designed to prevent people being 'lost' indoors - Google and Nokia champion versions where wi-fi networks and mobile phone networks offer rough 'positioning', whereas Rosenberg's system relies on a sensor that works out how far a person has walked. But the development raises privacy . concerns. Armed with information about shoppers’ movements thanks to the . IPS - indoor positioning systems -  stores could bombard them with offers tailored to them. Engineers funded by the German government, have designed an interior GPS-style system that can be operated from an everyday smartphone. Project manager Harald von Rosenberg got the idea from visiting a vast local 'megaplex shopping mall'. He said: ‘I thought, 'wouldn't it be . helpful if at such moments the smart phone could quickly shift to an . interior space navigator and point the way through the rows of shops and . stairwells.'‘ . The project designed a chip able to . register how fast and how far the user is walking - and work out direction, so it can offer precise 'navigation' information without having to contact a satellite, or even a mobile phone network. The project designed a chip able to register how fast and how far the user is walking - and work out direction, so it can offer precise 'navigation' information without having to contact a satellite, or even a mobile phone network . It downloads three dimensional plans from the internet but can also work 'on the go' by scanning a QR code on the front entrance of a shopping mall or other building. This approach would mean that the 'sat nav' doesn't need to connect to mobile networks while indoors - often difficult - to receive information. QR codes, the small, square boxes of barcode-style patterns, are an increasingly popular way for companies to put out promotional information or a competition. For this app, the code would include the layout design of a building, not just shops but a tourist attraction or an exhibition hall holding a trade fair for instance. The results are to be demonstrated at a technology fair and exhibition, in Germany, later this month which will unveil a tiny navigator chip the size of a fingernail. This means one smartphone can be used by a number of different people without having to change the settings. Von Rosenberg added: ‘There has never before been a device so small that can accomplish so much.’","App downloads 3D model of store and measures walking speed .

A glamorous Hollywood publicist who was gunned down as she drove home from a movie premiere died from a shot to the heart, her autopsy has revealed. Ronni Chasen, 64, was driving home from a showing of Burlesque when her Mercedes-Benz came under attack on Sunset Boulevard by a gunman with a stolen policeman's pistol on November 16. She was hit four times, the report said, including 'the most rapidly fatal' shot, which pierced her heart, then passed through the right-side pulmonary vein and the right lung. A toxicology test found no signs of alcohol or drugs in her system. The main suspect in the case, Harold Smith, committed suicide in the . lobby of a Hollywood apartment building when police approached him more . than three weeks after the slaying to question him. Initially, rumours swirled around Hollywood that Ms Chasen had been targeted in a professional hit. But police later claimed the crime scene was consistent with an attempted robbery or road rage. Ms Chasen’s car was found with its window cracked open a few inches. Police believe that Smith, a 43-year-old ex-convict, shot Ms Chasen. He shot himself dead on December 1 in a Santa Monica apartment building after being confronted by officers. The report revealed that the gun, . which was used in both shootings, was a revolver stolen from a police . officer during a burglary in the San Fernando Valley. Final hours: The evening before her brutal murder, Chasen, far right, arrived on the red carpet at the Burlesque premiere to support a client . Smash: Chasen was still breathing immediately after the crash, according to the first witnesses to reach her . Removed: Ms Chasen's damaged Mercedes Benz was towed away from Sunset Boulevard . Suspect: Harold Smith had been convicted for weapons and drugs charges . It is unclear what department that officer works for and when the weapon was stolen. The investigation concluded that it was unlikely that Ms Chasen had been killed in a professional hit. It . said that a professional would likely have used a more powerful weapon . and the hit would have been in a more remote location. The gunman also hit Ms Chasen in the shoulder and chest, rather than in a tight pattern. Ms Chasen received no death threats, was involved in no legal battles and seemed to live a ‘normal life’. The veteran publicist was driving her Mercedes Benz just after midnight on November 16 when she was shot in the chest, leading her car to smash into a light pole. Ms Chasen had just attended the premiere and after-party for the new movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera. She lived in Westwood, some 10 miles away, and may have been driving home when the attack occurred. The publicist ran her own public relations and marketing firm, Chasen & Co and was well known in the industry. She had worked as a publicist since 1973 with high-profile films on her resume like 1989's Driving Miss Daisy and 1994's Lolita. Grim: The LA county coroner removes Smith's body.

Classical composer Richard Wagner suffered from crippling migraines, the pain of which he used to compose some of his best works, scientists claim. Extracts from the musical genius’ memoirs revealed he experienced ‘nervous headaches’ while composing his opera Siegfried in September 1865. His depiction of his suffering included a 'scintillating, flickering, glimmering melody line with a zig-zag pattern' while a main character sings of 'Loathsome light!' as well as 'rustling and humming and blustering.' Migraines: Richard Wagner suffered from crippling headaches, researchers claim . The opera also opens with a pulsating thumping which gradually becomes more intense until it reaches an 'almost painful pulsation'. At the climax, the main character cries out 'compulsive plague! Pain without end!' which the researchers in Wagner’s native Germany believe is a representation of a 'painful, pulsating sensory migraine episode'. The research team claim his music has the characteristics of a typical migraine and the experimental flicker frequency gives 'important clues' about the performance speed intended by Wagner. Despite describing his symptoms as the ‘main plague of his life’ the composer frequently performed operas worldwide. Headaches: The composer suffered from migraines while he was writing an opera (file picture) His private writings also revealed he was ‘severely burdened’ by migraine and used his suffering creatively 'letting future generations take part in his emotions and perceptions'. Writing to fellow composer Franz Liszt in 1857 he said: 'I was literally not able to write a single bar without being driven away from my work by the most tremendous headaches.' In a video abstract, the researchers explain how 'his pain is in the centre of his music' and question what his music would have been like had Wagner been treated for his headaches and migraines. Researcher Carl Gobel from the Deaprtment of Neirology at of the University Hospital of Cologne, said: 'Here we show how Wagner deeply interwove his migraine attacks and auras into his music and libretti.' The findings are published in the Christmas edition of the British Medical Journal.","Extracts from memoirs revealed he experienced ‘nervous headaches’

A newly-divorced high school assistant principal has been arrested after allegedly having sex with one of her teenage students. Catherine Michele Bell, 33, turned herself in to the Shelby County Jail in Alabama on Thursday afternoon after a warrant was put out for her arrest. Bell, who has a four-year-old son with her ex-husband, has been charged with three counts of 'engaging in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse' with a student under the age of 19. She was held in the Shelby County Jail but was released later on Thursday evening after posting $90,000 bond. Arrest: Catherine Michelle Bell, 33, has been accused of having sex with a teenage male student while she was an assistant principal at an Alabama high school. She has resigned and faces charges . Bell, from Alabaster, was one of four assistant . principals at Pelham High School, attended by around 800 students, until she resigned in November. Court records show she and her husband Jeff . divorced in August and have shared custody of their young son, AL.com reported. The sheriff's office launched an investigation after being contacted by the Pelham Police Department, Capt. Ken Burchfield told the news sites. Authorities would not release specifics about the allegations against Bell and did not reveal the age of her alleged victim. Happier times: She is pictured with her ex-husband, whom she divorced this summer, and their son . Shelby County Schools spokeswoman Cindy Warner said they would not be answering questions but released a statement saying they took the allegations seriously. 'The school district took immediate action when we were first made aware of the allegations,' she said. 'The employee was placed on administrative leave while the matter was being investigated by the school district, with the assistance of local law enforcement. 'She subsequently resigned from her position on November 21.' Shelby County parents told WBRC that they are frustrated about this latest case - which comes less than two weeks after another teacher in the county pleaded guilty to similar charges. 'It's disheartening to hear that happened once again,' said Heather Bennett. Scene: She resigned from Pelham High School after the investigation into her conduct began . 'You're already worried about the . safety of your children with all the school shootings, on top of the . fact you can't trust you teachers, much less a principal now.'

Detectives investigating a number of needle attacks on women in Birmingham city centre have released this image of a suspect following the latest incident . Police are hunting a thug suspected of stabbing five women with hypodermic needles while on nights out in a city centre. The party-goers - aged between 20 and 30 - were all enjoying evenings in Birmingham when a man plunged a syringe into them as they walked along the street. Three of the girls are now enduring agonising waits to find out if they have contracted HIV. The assaults all occurred in Broad Street - the city's main night-time entertainment district - outside bustling clubs and bars at around 3am. Yesterday detectives released a CCTV image of a suspect they want to speak to in connection with the series of attacks on innocent revellers. The most recent assault happened at around 3am on November 3 when a 30-year-old woman had a needle jabbed into her thigh. Police believe the attack is linked to two similar incidents earlier in the year when a 20-year-old suffered a puncture wound on June 23 and a 28-year-old was stabbed on October 6. The three women are all facing anxious six-month waits to see whether they have contracted Hepatitis B or other blood-related diseases. Two other women previously stabbed with a needle on Broad Street - which sees over 50,000 revellers each weekend - have since been given the all clear. Detective Inspector Julie Woods, from West Midlands Police, said: 'We have received five reports in total over the last year-and-a-half and although the women have not been left with any obvious physical injuries they have had to endure an agonising wait to check that they have not suffered any long-lasting health effects. 'Whilst we have been unable to confirm exactly how the injuries were caused, it is believed that a hypodermic needle may have been used on each occasion, with young women being specifically targeted. 'Due to the nature of the offences, victims have not realised they have been injured until hours or days later, which has resulted in limited lines of enquiry. 'But we now have a particularly clear image of a man we want to identify in connection with the attacks and I would appeal for him, or anyone who knows who he may be, to come forward. The assaults all occurred in the city's main night-time entertainment district, Broad Street (pictured) 'These are strange offences and the motive at this stage is unclear, which is why it's so important for us to identify the person in this CCTV image as soon as possible. 'Birmingham remains one of the safest cities in the UK in which to enjoy a night out but if anyone sees any suspicious activity, I would encourage them to report it to police immediately.' Police have since stepped up patrols in a bid to reassure people visiting Birmingham city centre. Superintendent Danny Long added: 'This is an unusual offence which will understandably cause some concern and we are working extremely hard to find the person responsible. 'We have increased the number of officers on patrol in Broad Street and around the city centre, particularly since the attack earlier this month, and are working closely with street wardens, street pastors, licensees, door staff and clubbers themselves to keep people safe.'","Women were on nights out in Birmingham when they were attacked .

Rachael Ray's brother has defended the TV chef after she missed the funeral of her aunt who tragically died over the Thanksgiving holiday. Ray was criticized by her own cousin for skipping the upstate New York funeral of Geraldine Scuderi, 77, because it clashed with prior filming commitments in New York City. But her brother Emmanuel 'Manny' Ray said he was sad his sister's name was being dragged through the mud, claiming she 'works very hard' for herself but also to benefit others, including Scuderi's family. Defense: The brother of Rachael Ray pictured on her popular cooking show with Gwyneth Paltrow this year, has defended his sister after she missed their aunt's funeral . Speaking to RadarOnline at Scuderi's wake and funeral in Ticonderoga last week, Manny said no one at the funeral was upset his famous sister didn't attend the ceremonies because she had to work. 'It's sad that Rachael's getting dragged into this when she really has nothing to do with it,' he told the website. 'She works very hard, and not only does she work for herself, but everyone she cares about. The people that work for her, the people around her, including (Geraldine's) family. She's been very good to them and I'm sorry they've decided to degrade it for this.' Manny and Rachael's cousin and Scuderi's daughter, Gina Mesnick, told the National Enquirer she blamed the Ray family for her mother's death. She also said she doubted Rachael had 'shed a single tear' over the tragedy. Tragic: Geraldine Dominica Scuderi of Queensbury, New York, passed away on November 29 at the age of 77 after becoming trapped outside a home she was house-sitting for Rachael Ray's mother in the bitter cold . Scene: Rachael Ray's aunt Geraldine allegedly passed away after getting trapped outside Rachael's mother's Upstate New York home, pictured . Manny described the family situation . as 'touchy,' and told Radar, 'I know that Gina is the one who kind of . sparked this whole thing. It's upsetting.' He said other relatives actually apologized for Mesnick's behavior and the public backlash it has caused at the funeral. However, he insisted the family was still tight and would pull through the negative attention. 'We love them dearly, and this is just one of those things that families go through,' he said. Scuderi sadly collapsed and died in the freezing cold when she became locked out of the chef's mother's home over the Thanksgiving holiday. The . 77-year-old was house-sitting for Ray's mother Elsa Scuderi when she . locked herself out of the house in upstate New York on November 29 as . temperatures dipped to 9F. Around . 4 p.m., the woman reportedly went outside to feed the birds but could . not get back into the home, despite desperately trying to break a . window. She died of a heart attack, according to an autopsy report. Couple: TV chef Rachael Ray and her producer husband John Cusimano both missed the funeral . Mesnick later told National Enquirer: 'My mother is dead today because the Ray family neglected her.' Speaking of her mother's death, she added: 'At some point in the evening, I suspect that, because of her (chronic lung problems), she had trouble breathing and collapsed in the driveway and basically died there. Her body wasn't found until the following morning.' The Enquirer claims the aunt, who had a history of heart problems, had not been left a key to get back into the home. Mesnick told the magazine that her mother was not given a key while house-sitting five days a week - for which she was paid $300 - but had to share with another house-sitter. Neighbors close to the property were home at the time but it appears that the elderly woman was unable to make it the short distance for help. Scuderi's body was found the day after she died. Rachael Ray's Aunt Geraldine passed away after getting trapped outside Rachael's mother's home in this neighborhood in upstate New York over Thanksgiving weekend .

A representative for Rachael Ray told MailOnline Wednesday: 'Unfortunately, the day of Rachael's aunt's funeral coincided with the final day of taping for the 2013 season of her daytime talk show.

Radio 1's mission to attract younger listeners is under threat - because parents and grandparents are refusing to switch off. The station has been ordered to bring the average age of its listeners down from 32 by the BBC Trust, which says it should be trying to win over 15 to 29-year-olds. It dropped 39-year-old Chris Moyles from the breakfast show in favour of Nick Grimshaw, 28, who has lost nearly a million listeners since taking over in September. But the over-55s are still tuning in - the only Radio 1 listeners whose numbers have increased in the past year. Radio 2's Chris Evans, left, is trouncing Nick Grimshaw, right, by four million listeners on the breakfast show, as Radio 1 finds the over-55s are still listening to the station despite its attempts to attract those aged 15 to 29 . The statistics were revealed in the . latest round of audience ratings from Rajar, which saw the station lose . nearly 900,000 listeners in the first three months of 2013, a loss of 1.3million listeners since the first quarter of 2012. Radio 1's market share of over-55s has increased from 1.3 per cent to 1.6 per cent in the last year. Its share of 25 to 35-year-olds has dropped from 25.7 per cent to 17.4 per cent - losing 300,000 in that age group. Grimshaw's 5.8million audience is the lowest for the breakfast show since it was hosted by Sara Cox in 2003. Meanwhile, 47-year-old Chris Evans streaked ahead of his young rival, adding 600,000 listeners to his Radio 2 breakfast show take its audience to a record 9.8million. The four million difference is thought to be the biggest gap ever seen between the two stations. 'Radio 1 still faces significant trouble with 55+ – they just don’t want to go,' wrote radio consultant Matt Deegan, creative director of Folder Media, in a blog analysing the Rajar figures. A reshuffle on Radio 1 saw 40-year-old Scott Mills, left, moved from the 4 to 7pm drivetime slot in favour of Greg James 27, while Chris Moyles, 39, made way for Nick Grimshaw on the breakfast show in September . 'Those 55+ wedded to Radio 1 cannot be shifted and their average hours are still good – keeping the station's average age up. 'Moyles listeners were older and more passionate – he was the longest serving Radio 1 breakfast presenter after all – that means they’re going to listen longer. You churn them out and it’ll have this sort of effect.' Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper told The Independent: 'Radio 1 is one of the most famous stations in the world and it’s a hard habit to break.' 'I’m 43 and I will always probably continue to listen to it because I love new music and I want to know what the next big thing is. There’ll always be a section of society, whatever age, who will want to do that. 'There are more older people than younger people in the UK population and that will affect our average age. You can’t tell people to stop listening.' Greg James, left, and Jameela Jamil, both 27, have been promoted to more prominent slots on the station as Radio 1 tries to lower the average age of its audience from 32 following orders from the BBC Trust . Cooper is carrying out a two-year plan to revitalise the station. Moyles, 39, was axed from the breakfast show in September in favour of 28-year-old Grimshaw, while Greg James, 27, took over the 4-7pm drivetime slot from Scott Mills, 40. Cooper also made 27-year-old Jameela Jamil the host of the Sunday afternoon chart show, and told the Independent he would like listening figures to include the station's YouTube channels, which attract younger listeners who prefer to get their music online. Radio 1 stalwarts Annie Nightingale, 73, Tim Westwood, 55, and Pete Tong, 52, still present specialist music evening shows on the station.","Radio 1 has been ordered to attract younger listeners by the BBC Trust .

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:28 EST, 28 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:08 EST, 28 November 2013 . Amid Syria's ferocious civil war, a nun has emerged as an unlikely power broker and figure of controversy. Mother Superior Agnes-Mariam of the Cross has thrust herself into the role of go-between and publicist, arranging cease-fires, organizing pro-government media trips and conducting speaking tours as perhaps the country's most prominent critic of the uprising against President Bashar Assad. Anti-government activists scathingly call her 'Assad's nun' for claiming a chemical attack that killed hundreds was exaggerated, and for saying rebels used kidnapped babies in massacres that were blamed on Syrian forces. Unlikely saviour?: Mother Superior Agnes-Mariam Of The Cross walks with people fleeing the rebel held suburb of Moadamiyeh to the government held territory in Damascus, Syria . Peacemaker? Mother Superior Agnes-Mariam holds hands with people fleeing the rebel stronghold after arranging a temporary ceasefire . She is so despised by the opposition that even acts of seeming goodwill are criticized, such as arranging a rare truce that allowed thousands to leave a blockaded town. Supporters see her as a brave truth-teller, and she reflects the fears of many Syrians who worry that hard-line Muslim rebels trying to overthrow Assad will make life intolerable for Christians and other minorities. The nun insists she is not an Assad propagandist, describing his family's decades-long hold over Syria as a 'tumor,' but she saves her harshest criticism for the rebels. 'The rebels presented themselves as the doctor who will remove this tumor,' she said in a recent Skype interview. 'They imposed arms as a treatment, and it is killing Syria.' Agnes-Mariam, 61, was born Fadia Laham in Lebanon to Palestinian Christian refugees. In the social upheaval of the 1960s, Laham was a self-described hippie and trekked to Nepal on what she called a spiritual journey that led her to Catholicism. She moved to Syria two decades ago, establishing a new order within the Greek Catholic Church, The Unity of Antioch, and founded the St. James convent 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Damascus. Outspoken: The nun has been perhaps the most prominent critic of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad (pictured) The nun was skeptical of the two-year-old Syrian uprising from the start. She claimed much of the footage of anti-Assad demonstrations posted to social media networks was faked, along with video of Syrian forces beating and killing protesters . The Syrian government heavily restricts foreign reporting on the fighting. But Agnes-Mariam organized pro-government media tours, using her connections to obtain visas for journalists. During a January 2012 tour, French TV reporter Gilles Jacquier was killed in a mortar attack in the city of Homs. Officials said he was killed by rebels, while reporters accused the government. Agnes-Mariam said she was unfairly blamed. In May 2012, after Assad-loyal forces massacred dozens of Sunni men, women and children in the Houla region, she claimed the slain children were Alawites - members of Assad's sect - who had been kidnapped by rebels. She made a similar claim after hundreds of civilians were killed in a chemical attack on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus on August 21. In a 50-page report, she said the children were probably kidnapped because their mothers weren't in the videos that activists uploaded to YouTube. She also claimed some videos were faked so victims would appear more numerous. Her report was cited by Russia's foreign minister to cast doubt on claims that Assad forces perpetrated the attack. Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said Agnes-Marie's allegations were 'based on bizarre theories about bodies being moved.' He said it is normal for the bodies of men and women to be separated so that they can be ritually washed according to Islamic custom. Most recently, Agnes-Mariam surprised reporters in late October by appearing in her black habit and white wimple outside the rebel-held town of Moadamiyeh, where she brokered a truce allowing residents to be evacuated from the besieged area. Controversy: The nun has played down reports of atrocities on the part of al-Assad's forces since the uprising began . Agnes-Mariam said she got involved after seeing photographs of starving Moadamiyeh children on her Facebook feed. 'I said, ""This doesn't happen in Syria,""' she said. The nun contacted other government and security officials she knew from decades of interfaith outreach. She said she gradually built up her connections through her 'pushy' personality and constant lobbying, saying people found it hard to refuse a nun. The truce failed several times, but over a series of days, some 5,000 people were evacuated. Activist Qusai Zakariya, however, accused of nun of breaking her word by allowing Assad's security forces to seize men suspected of being armed rebels as they left. Violence: Residents gather at a site hit by what activists say was a Scud missile from forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Raqqa, eastern Syria this morning . Zakariya said she bears responsibility for their fate if they were tortured or killed in custody. The nun said the men were taken to determine their status as civilians or fighters. She said that two men disappeared but that volunteers were trying to locate them. George Kallas, an official at the Beirut-based Greek Catholic Patriarchate, which oversees Agnes-Mariam's convent, would not comment directly on her work and said her statements do not reflect the opinion of the Greek Catholic Church. Agnes-Mariam is now on a speaking tour of the U.S., Canada and Britain. But she withdrew from an anti-war conference in London this weekend after other speakers threatened to quit if she participated. Devastation: Civilians and rescuers search under rubble at a site hit by what activists say was a Scud missile from Assad's forces . In Britain's weekly Spectator, one writer called her 'the Syrian equivalent of one of Hitler's brown priests.' Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said she 'abuses her religious status to spread her lies.' To others, she is a humanitarian who is informing the West by correcting biased media reporting. 'She is searching for the truth about what is happening in Syria,' said Damascus-based freelance reporter Safa Mohammed. For her part, the nun said she is doing her flawed best. 'I am not the awaited-for Messiah,' she said. 'I am trying to work as a human.'","Mother Superior Agnes-Miriam has thrust herself into the spotlight in Syria .

Accused: British multi-millionaire entrepreneur Gregory Cox (pictured at court this week) is accused of sexually assaulting a woman, 21 . A British tycoon accused of forcing a woman to perform oral sex on him told her ‘there was nothing she could do’ because of his fortune, a court heard today. Gregory Charles Cox, 32, faces two charges of sexual intercourse without consent with a 21-year-old tourist on the iconic Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia. The holidaymaker from Bermuda claimed Cox had said: ‘You . can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never . go anywhere – I’ve got a lot of money.’ Crown Prosecutor Elizabeth Wilkins SC . told the court today that the woman had kissed and exchanged phone . numbers with the man’s friend Christopher Galea. The . court heard that the 32-year-old woman also spoke to Cox, who founded . his own financial services firm, about the English private school he . went to while at beachfront bar The Bucket List in January 2012. The . pair then went to the beach after many hours drinking together when she . remembers Cox sitting against a concrete wall while she had her back to . the ocean. According to Ninemsn, Ms Wilkins said: ‘She recalls being on her knees, trying to stand up but not being able to. ‘She recalls being held down, she recalls crying and being terrified.’ In . his opening address to the jury in May, prosecutor Huw Baker said: ‘She . recalls being on her knees and she tried to stand up but being unable . to stand up because something was holding her down,’ he said. ‘She . recalls being terrified at that point.’ Cox is then said to have forced her to perform a sex act on him. 'Will go nowhere': The court heard that Cox (pictured leaving court this week) told the woman that 'you can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never go anywhere - I've got a lot of money' Afterwards she cried and hit Cox on the thighs as she told him: ‘Please stop, please stop – I don’t want this.’ Mr Baker said: ‘She was trying to get up but felt the accused’s hand on the back of her head.’ Her cries for help were later heard . by a young couple and she was taken to a police station, where officers . described her as being ‘distressed, shivering and crying’. Police were also said to have heard her say: ‘He told me over and over again that he had a lot of money.’ Met while holidaying: The woman, a holidaymaker from Bermuda, met Cox at The Bucket List bar in the Bondi Pavilion (pictured) on the beachfront where they talked about the English private school that Cox went to, the court heard . Cox, who founded the Manchester-based . Quintessential Finance Group, was also on holiday in Australia when the . alleged attack took place in January last year. He had been staying in a luxury beach-side apartment in the suburb of Bronte, a few miles from Bondi. The businessman, who lists Peaches . Geldof among his Facebook friends, was arrested four days after the . alleged incident when he returned to the bar and was spotted by staff . who had been supplied with his description by police. Graeme Turnbull, defending, told the . Sydney court that the woman’s conduct ‘was entirely consistent with a . willing participant’. After hours of drinking: The alleged crime is said to have happened on Bondi Beach, Sydney, which is visited by thousands of Britons every year . The jury heard that Cox had told friends the woman ‘freaked out’ after the sex act, threw her handbag in the air and ran off. As she left her belongings on the . beach, said Mr Turnbull, Cox had handed them in to a city centre police . station, where he gave his own details. Mr Turnbull also said that his client had gone back to the Bondi beach bar to ask if anyone knew the woman. ‘If he is a rapist, is that consistent?’ he asked the court. Cox has pleaded not guilty to the two charges of sex without consent. The trial continues.

Fifteen out of 50 payday lenders have quit rather than prove their business practices are up to scratch, after a watchdog ordered them to show that they act responsibly. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said that 14 of the lenders have told it that they are leaving the payday market and another firm which failed to meet the deadline has said it is no longer operating as a lender. The watchdog has been carrying out a probe into 'deep-rooted' problems within the industry, such as lenders encouraging struggling borrowers to roll over loans they cannot afford so that the debt balloons. The OFT is investigating 'deep-rooted' problems within the industry, such as lenders encouraging struggling borrowers to roll over loans they cannot afford so that the debt balloons . Last month it referred the sector for a full-blown investigation by the Competition Commission. A 12-week cut-off point set by the OFT for 50 lenders, which account for 90 per cent of the market, to show they are acting responsibly has now passed for all firms. The OFT said that of the 14 lenders who are leaving the payday industry, three have surrendered their licences completely. The other 11 continue to operate in other areas where they still need a consumer credit licence to trade, such as pawnbroking or debt collection, for example. The watchdog is going through reports provided by 46 firms in total, including the 11 firms who are pulling out of the payday market but still need to have a consumer credit licence. Vince Cable said the OFT's action 'clearly shows that tough enforcement is having a real effect' These reports, which have been compiled by independent auditors, must demonstrate to the OFT that lenders are complying with the rules and have put right particular concerns it has raised. They must prove, for example, that firms have removed any misleading advertising, that they are being clear with consumers about the terms of the loan up-front and that they are carrying out proper affordability checks. The watchdog identified areas of concern with each of the 50 firms and in some cases it sent them annexes of up to 70 pages long. If the OFT still has concerns after going through the responses it has a range of powers such as stopping firms in their tracks immediately or choosing to inspect them again. David Fisher, OFT senior director for consumer credit, said: 'We are evaluating the audit reports sent in by payday lenders and will announce any further action in due course. 'Should any lenders fail to demonstrate they are fully compliant we have several options open to us to protect consumers, including suspending or revoking their licences.' Business Secretary Vince Cable said the OFT's action 'clearly shows that tough enforcement is having a real effect'. He said: 'Clearly there is more work to be done. I look to the remaining 35 lenders to take action to fix the problems in their own practices, or face up to further sanctions by regulators.' Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which? said: 'People are increasingly turning to high cost credit just to pay for essentials or repay other debts, so it is vital that the Government and regulators continue get tougher on irresponsible lenders.' Russell Hamblin-Boone, chief executive of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents short-term lenders, said: 'We have consistently called for those lenders who don't, won't or simply can't meet the standards set by responsible payday lenders, to either shape up or ship out. 'All CFA members have responded positively to the OFT and await its response.'","Watchdog has launched probe into 'deep-rooted' problems in the industry .

'Within about two minutes of walking up, they said it was an IED and cleared us out of the house,' Cannon said. Cleveland County Sheriff Alan Norman said Cannon was very lucky. Though he said he couldn't speak to the construction of the device or how it could be set off, the sheriff said it was capable of causing serious damage. 'It could have caused personal injury had the device activated,' Norman said. Anthony Cannon put the bear in his car and drove it to his cousin's home in Shelby (pictured) where he made the shocking discovery . The bomb was deactivated and sent to a lab. Federal investigators are inspecting the device, looking for clues as to who made it. Another bomb was discovered in the same area six months ago. In 2009, authorities discovered two homemade bombs several days apart in Shelby. None of those cases has been solved. Cannon said he and other local residents are concerned that whoever is making the bombs will eventually hurt someone. Even though he could have been seriously injured or killed, Cannon said he is happy he picked the bear up out of the road.

The 47-year-old writer moved from the eight-bedroom Merchiston home to a house in Barnton in 2009. But she had already written at least four of the seven books in the 19th century, ivy-clad building where she lived with her husband Dr Neil Murray and her three children. House of inspiration: The Edinburgh house where Harry Potter author JK Rowling wrote at least four of the seven book has been sold for more than £2.25m . Scenic home: The house - which has been bought by a local Scottish businessman - was the author's home with her husband and children until she moved out in 2009 . Scene of her writing: The view from the patio at the rear of the house looking out into the garden . Change of fortune: JK Rowling was a single mother living on benefits before her Harry Potter novels made her millions . In the prospectus estate agents Rettie who are selling the family home, describe the property as  being situated in 'one of Edinburgh's most exclusive conservation areas.' Built on two floors, the stone building has landscaped gardens and several outhouses as well as a detached split-level office. Although it is valued at a cool £2.5million, JK Rowling is worth around £560 million according to the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List. Prospective buyers being shown around . the home will be disappointed to learn the remnants of the famous author . will be not be spotted.

It has been decorated with neutral colours, although the pink sofas in the living room show off a spark of flair. The new owner will be able to enjoy . off-street parking and a double garage which can be accessed from a . cobbled lane at the rear of the house. Space: the kitchen of the eight-bedroom Merchiston home boasts an abundance of space and natural daylight . Emptied out: The house has been completely refurbished since the author and her family moved out in 2009 . The gardens are walled and the property comes with an advanced alarm security system - this is not . surprising as the author has previously spoken in the past of how . difficult she found the scrutiny of the press. Last year she told the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards that she and her family were driven out of their home . and deterred from taking family holidays because of the constant . presence of photographers.

Miss Rowling, 46, bought her current . home, a 17th century mansion for more than £2 million in 2009 when she . reportedly fell in love with it after viewing just two of its 31 rooms. She lives there with her husband, their two young children and her 18-year-old daughter . Jessica, from her first marriage. The property has been dubbed ‘Fortress Rowling’ by some because of its security fences and reinforced doors. Giant trees were lifted by crane over the garden walls to give the author and her family more privacy. Secure: The house has an intercom for secure entry - JK Rowling has previously spoken of how difficult she found life with paparazzi outside her home . Last year JK Rowling got planning permission to flatten a £1 million 1970s style house next door to make her garden larger. She also got approval to build a summer house that critics said looked like the stone hut inhabited by Hagrid, the giant groundsman from her best-selling novels. In July JK Rowling's husband applied for planning permission for two huge interlocked treehouses at her new home in Barnton. Portfolio: As well as landscaped gardens, the property comes with several outhouses . Spacious: There are three different exits from the grounds of the impressive house . But even by JK Rowling’s standards . the 40ft high, two-storey tree houses planned for the back garden of her . mansion are something spectacular. The Hogwarts-style towers - estimated to cost around £150,000 - are so big that they need planning permission. Each wooden tree house is to be built . on stilts and boasts balconies, carvings and turrets that wouldn’t look . out of place in a Potter adventure. The towers are linked by a rope bridge and can be approached by a secret tunnel hidden underneath a raised wooden walkway. Place to work: The house also comes with an office building, which could be where JK Rowling penned her famous novels .

He was found guilty of murder today . The Australian businessman accused of throwing his girlfriend to her death from the balcony of their luxury Sydney apartment has been found guilty. Simon Gittany, 40, had denied murdering Canadian former ballerina and aspiring model Lisa Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row during which a security camera had shown him dragging her back into the apartment with his hand across her mouth. Just over a minute later, she had plunged to her death - and Justice Lucy McCallum, in a damning assessment of Gittany’s character, said she did not believe his account of how his fiancee had fallen from the balcony. As the verdict was delivered in the New South Wales Supreme Court Gittany stood still while his girlfriend Rachelle Louise started screaming. Ms Louise yelled at the judge, and was taken from the court in floods of tears while Ms Harnum's family members smiled and embraced after the verdict was handed down. Crowds gathered outside the court as Justice McCallum, who had sat without a jury during the four-week-long trial, began delivering her verdict in the case which has gripped the nation. She stated that Gittany was 'controlling, dominating and, at times, abusive' of Ms Harnum. She found he lied 'with telling ease' and distorted the truth when he took the stand. 'At many times in his evidence the accused struck me as being a person playing a role, telling a story which fit with the objective evidence but which did no more than that,' Justice McCallum  reported News.co.au.

Guilty: Simon Gittany, 40, had denied murdering Canadian former ballerina and aspiring model Lisa Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row during which a security camera had shown him dragging her back into the apartment with his hand across her mouth . 'It lacked originality and the subtlety of actual experience.' The . Crown had told the court that Gittany was domineering and had tried to . control everything his fiancee did, even the way she wore her hair and . what clothes she chose to go out in. Gittany had admitted during the trial that he was a ‘jealous partner.’ ‘She . would wear revealing clothes, sometime with no bra. I would tell her . she should continue to look beautiful but just to tone down how much she . was revealing of her body so she didn’t attract the wrong attention and . give out the wrong signals,’ he told the court. But . his defence team claimed that Miss Harnum’s struggle with an eating . disorder may have been the reason she jumped to her death. The . judge began her summing up by examining the relationship between . Gittany and his fiancee, saying she had sought to avoid being influenced . by the ‘shocking and tragic’ nature of Miss Harnum’s death. There was . no doubt, she said, that the couple loved each other. But the judge said that ‘by the time of her death, Lisa Harnum had no friends except a personal trainer and a counsellor. Struggle: The prosecutor asked Gittany if he had used his 'superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression' when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit before her death (above) Gittany, . she said, had used CCTV cameras to monitor Miss Harnum’s movements in . their 15th storey apartment and the scrutiny she was subjected to was . ‘intrusive and overbearing.’ Judge . McCallum said the relationship reached the point when Miss Harnum . changed her Facebook status to ‘single’ and had signed a contract to . store her belongings in Bondi as she prepared to leave her controlling . fiancé. On the day that . Gittany found Miss Harnum had packed her bags, said the judge, he . reacted ‘with nothing short of rage’ and she did not accept his denial . that he had made enraged threats. ‘I have no hesitation accepting . evidence of…rage,’ said the judge. His denials were ‘manifestly implausible…he was controlling and abusive…out of control,’ she added. Gittany . sat in the dock clutching a small cup of water as the verdict was being . delivered, his new girlfriend, brunette Rachelle Louise sitting in the . public gallery. Evidence: CCTV footage shows Simon Gittany holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he  threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th-floor balcony of their Sydney apartment . Gesticulating: Gittany throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street . By the end . of July Gittany’s relationship with Miss Harnum had reached crisis . point, the judge noted. ‘I do not think there can be any doubt the . accused was controlling, dominating and at time abusive.’ The . night before her death, the couple had watched Romeo and Juliet in bed . before he got up to watch porn on the morning of his girlfriend’s death. ‘I . find it difficult to believe he was watching porn’ on the morning of . the death,’ said the judge, adding she assumed he had instead got up to . monitor her emails and text messages. 'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge. She . referred to a witness, Josh Rathmell’ who had told the court of seeing . Gittany throwing something from the balcony, evidence, she said, that . was ‘compelling’. The judge . did not believe Gittany’s account of how Miss Harnum fell to her death - . he had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto . the balcony but had failed to stop her falling. ‘It’s difficult to . articulate my impression of that evidence except that I found him . unconvincing,’ said the judge. 'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge . 'At . many times in his evidence, the accused struck me as being a person . playing a role, telling a story which fitted with the objective evidence . but which did no more than that. ‘His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail.’ As . Justice McCallum’s verdict details entered their fourth hour, Gittany’s . girlfriend began to sob, while he stared straight ahead at the judge. The judge had up to that point said little that gave him any hope of walking away from the court a free man. She . said Miss Harnum could not have behaved in the way Gittany said she had . - clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints. She said it was likely that Miss Harnum was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death. Speaking outside court, an emotional Joan Harnum told reporters 'there are no winners in this case'. 'Two families have had their lives dramatically changed forever,' she said reported Nine News MSN.

"By . Bel Mooney . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 21 March 2013 . This week we once again received the unequivocal message that the Government doesn't value stay-at-home mums. According to the Treasury, mothers who look after their children full-time do not need as much financial help as those who work. These insultingly warped priorities emerged as the Coalition declared its intention to give working mothers tax breaks worth thousands to cover the costs of paying someone else to look after their children. Families where only one parent works won't get a penny. The message is loud and clear: mothers who go back to the workplace are valued more than those who do not. Scroll down for video . The new Budget favours mothers who go to work over those who choose to care for their children full-time . Yet in the first three years of life, a baby's developing brain doubles in size. Every tickle, every warm chuckle, every waggle of a toy is a mini-explosion of brain-power, joy and love that impacts on what happens in later years. Make no mistake: mothers and fathers are (in the words of the experts) 'growing their babies' brains'. Children's minister Elizabeth Truss has denied this new childcare plan is trying to force women back to work. But in her recent pronouncements I have searched in vain for an awareness of the fundamental needs of tiny children. It's all about market forces, parents' needs and, well, getting more mothers back to work. What's more, Truss's recent policy document More Great Childcare (who came up with such a clunky title?) proposes to reduce staff-to-child ratios in nurseries and at childminders, which means that staff will have less time to engage with each child. Already those who care most about young children (the National Children's Bureau, for example) are in revolt. When will policymakers talk about mothering? Or acknowledge that the uniquely close relationship between a mother and her baby is vital? Getting mothers back to work has been an obsession of politicians (especially Labour) for decades. I consider myself a feminist and understand the urge (as well as the economic need) to work. But I believe we also need to ask a truly radical question: whether 'outsourcing' mothering is the best way to create a healthy society. George Osborne's new budget, left, penalises mothers who stay at home, right . Children under three have to be spoken for since they can't speak for themselves. This may seem obvious, but the message has just been drummed into my head at the 20th anniversary conference of a small charity called What About The Children? Its motto is 'Raising awareness about the never-changing emotional needs of under-threes in our ever-changing society'. We can accumulate technology and work ever harder to pay for it. We can shift our expectations of what constitutes happiness and success. But do babies and toddlers change? No. What they require from those closest to them is what they have needed for centuries: to be paid attention to and to feel secure. Parents may work all hours to give themselves and their children a good lifestyle, but what their babies need is consistent love. Already I can hear cries of protest. I'll be accused of not understanding that poorer mothers need to work and women with careers are usually desperate to return to the workplace after maternity leave - and what's wrong with that? It will also be pointed out that children from chaotic backgrounds are better off in nurseries. While that's true, it's also a key argument against Elizabeth Truss's plan to reduce staff-to-child ratios. Parents may work all hours to give themselves and their children a good lifestyle, but what their babies need is consistent love . I also know that stay-at-home dads can be just as good as mums, and that if grandparents take on childcare, then all the better. There are no rules for family life; people muddle along and the concept of being a 'good enough' parent is wonderfully liberating.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't think about what babies need. The lectures I heard at the What About The Children? conference left me in no doubt that new mothers should think very carefully about their choices. Successive governments have brainwashed women that being a stay-at-home mum is somehow letting the side down. Let others debate the blunt economics of childcare - what really matters is how babies develop secure relationships and why that benefits us all. Twenty years ago, distinguished teacher and psychotherapist Doreen Goodman started What About The Children? in response to the horrific murder of Jamie Bulger. She expressed the view that the little boy's young killers were victims, too, because children who have their emotional needs met early in life are unlikely to become murderers. She argued strongly that children should be cared for primarily by a consistent mother figure for the first three years. To understand the relationship between mother and baby, scientists have looked at the behaviour of the mother and the ways in which the baby responds . The great psychologist and psychiatrist John Bowlby was saying the same thing in the Fifties. His vast experience and fieldwork led him to develop attachment theory: the idea that infants need to experience a warm and continuous relationship with their mother (or permanent mother substitute) in order to thrive. He was attacked by feminists and ostracised by psychoanalysts for saying what now seems obvious: that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child is a vital part of parenting. His work is underpinned by a vast amount of research. To understand the relationship between mother and baby, scientists have looked at the behaviour of the mother and the ways in which the baby responds. Elizabeth Truss with one of her children . Their work highlights the potential dangers of over-reliance on nursery care for under-threes and shows a baby's brain grows new structures in response to the love and caring firmness given during its first two years of life. If you want to see a fascinating example of this in practice, go to YouTube and type 'Dr Edward Tronick + Still Face Experiment' into the search box. It shows what happens when an attentive mum ceases to respond to her baby. It is a powerful warning of what can happen if an adult in charge of a baby doesn't really bother. You can see and hear the child's stress level rise within seconds. I learned much about babies' separation anxiety and stress at the What About The Children? conference - and wish Elizabeth Truss had been there, too. She'd have heard Professor Sir Denis Pereira Grey (former president of the Royal College of Practitioners), early years expert Dr Carole Ulanowsky, consultant child psychotherapist Robin Balbernie and professor of social work and psychology David Howe talk about how growing problems in society, such as depression, can be due to poor child/carer relationships and stress in the first three years. John Carnochan, a senior Scottish policeman and world-famous expert on violence, linked the terrible things he's dealt with all his professional life to the inadequate care babies get. Questioning our attitudes as a society, he seemed to think too many parents treat their children as accessories. Is that true, I wonder? I cite those distinguished names to show this is a matter of importance and urgency. High levels of group care before the age of two have been associated with increased anti-social behaviour. A recent study found young children cared for by their mothers did significantly better in developmental tests than those in any other sort of care. Of course, I'm not blaming any woman who wants to go back to work, but one of the most gloomy experiences I've ever had was visiting an expensive day nursery in the City of London. Rows of cots contained babies whose high-flying mothers were at work, often from 7am to 7pm. It wasn't quite as terrible as the two crowded orphanages I went to in Romania in 1990. But, let's be honest, in both places the babies were 'parked'. They were taken care of without being cared for. Why is the Government so desperate to make this the norm? The staff had no instinct (even if they had the time) to blow loving raspberries on tums. Or to help the babies of strangers to make sense of their own, individual precious place in the world. Sorry, David Cameron, but even you must be able to see that's far from a good thing.","Coalition has chosen to give working mothers tax breaks .

A report by the London-based Oxford Research Group found a quarter of children killed in the conflict were shot in small arms fire while seven in 10 were blown up. The ORG recorded a total of 11,420 child deaths - a figure which includes children caught in cross fire, as well as others allegedly targeted by snipers, summarily executed and in some cases, tortured. Scroll down for video . Research by the Oxford Research Group found that more than 11,000 children have been killed in Syria's civil war. Here, a woman stands next to the bodies of people allegedly found in the Quweiq river, in Aleppo . The study, Stolen Futures: The hidden toll of child casualties in Syria, reveals 764 children were recorded as summarily executed, 112 were reported to have been tortured, including some of infant age. Children in older age groups were . targeted more often than younger children, and overall boys outnumbered . girls killed by about two to one, according to the research. The ORG said older boys in the 13 to 17 year old group were consistently the most . frequent victims of targeted killings such as those involving sniper . fire, execution or torture. The highest child casualty figures were in the governate of Aleppo, but . relative to its size, the worst affected governorate was Daraa, where . roughly one in 400 children was recorded killed. In addition, 128 children were recorded killed by chemical weapons in Ghouta on August 21, 2013. Report co-author Hamit Dardagan said: 'The data we analysed indicates that bombs and bullets alone ended the lives of ten thousand Syrian children in 30 months of war. A Syrian government solider aims his weapon during clashes with Free Syrian Army fighters, not pictured, in Maaloula village, north-east of the capital Damascus . A Syrian youth holds a child wounded by Syrian Army shelling near Dar al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo . 'The world needs to take a much closer interest in the effects of the conflict on Syria’s children.' The ORG compiled the report using the same Syrian civil society-sourced databases it has used to produce previous casualty statistics but examines in greater detail the information they contain on victims and how they were killed. Co-author Hana Salama added: 'What is most disturbing about the findings of this report is not only the sheer numbers of children killed in this conflict, but the way they are being killed. 'Bombed in their homes, in their communities, during day-to-day activities such as waiting in bread lines or attending school; shot by bullets in crossfire, targeted by snipers, summarily executed, even gassed and tortured. 'All conflict parties need to take responsibility for the protection of children, and ultimately find a peaceful solution for the war itself. 'This study shows why explosive weapons should never be used where children live and play, how older children quickly become targets in a war and even the youngest suffer its worst abuses.

Compensation: VIP Harrah's hostess Andrea McNulty settled her claim but it is unclear whether she received money as part of the settlement . Ms McNulty, now 33, said the quarterback lured her into his room under false presence that he needed his television fixed. Roethlisberger was in town at the time to play in a celebrity golf tournament, and denied the allegations. The original lawsuit filed in 2009 sought a minimum of $440,000 in damages from the quarterback, at least $50,000 in damages from the Harrah's officials and an unspecified amount in punitive damages. Ms McNulty said she never filed a criminal complaint because she feared Harrah's would side with Roethlisberger and she would be fired. The Reno Gazette-Journal first reported the settlement on its website. It also dismisses claims against Harrah's employees whom the woman had accused of covering up the alleged sexual assault in Roethlisberger's penthouse suite in July 2008. Ms McNulty’s lawyer Cal Dunlap first told Washoe District Court Judge Brent Adams in papers filed last November that his client wanted to have a stay lifted so the case could be dismissed because a settlement was pending. Quarterback: Roethlisberger, despite mimicking the pose of Tim Tebow, who is an outspoken Christian, faced sexual assault charges again in 2010 . ‘All parties have reached a resolution of all claims and counterclaims,’ he wrote. Mr Adams formally dismissed the case December  27 but neither side had publicized it until now. David Cornwell, Roethlisberger's lawyer, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on Friday. His agent, Ryan Tollner, said neither he nor Roethlisberger would have any comment. The Nevada Supreme Court had ruled against the two-time Super Bowl champion quarterback's request in August to have the case moved from Reno to Carson City because it was closer to where the alleged incident had occurred at Harrah's in Stateline. He faced similar claims in 2010 after a 20-year-old Georgia college student accused him of sexually assaulting her after a night of drinking at a bar. Though Georgia authorities investigated the allegations, no charges were formally filed.","Ben Roethlisberger settled out of court with hostess Andrea McNulty .

Hero: Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden, was accused of dubious murder charges by Pakistan on Friday . The heroic doctor who helped the United States pinpoint Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was hit with a bizarre murder charge in Pakistan on Friday. Shakil Afridi, 49, was accused of killing a teenage boy who died after the doctor performed surgery on . him for appendicitis in 2006, a development which could further strain ties between the two countries. Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA in an . attempt to verify Bin Laden's presence in the . town of Abbottabad, prior to the U.S. raid that killed him in 2011. That secret operation outraged Pakistan and plunged relations between the strategic partners to a new low. Pakistan . arrested Afridi after the raid and sentenced him last year to 33 years . in jail for 'conspiring against the state' and membership of militant . group Lashkar-e-Islam. The doctor's family and the militants denied the allegations. In August, Pakistan overturned his conviction, citing procedural errors and ordering a retrial. Afridi is currently imprisoned in Peshawar Central Jail. Friday's murder charge, relating to . the death of a patient eight years ago, dims Afridi's chances of going . free and could further sour ties with the United States. Pinpointed: Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA in an attempt to verify Bin Laden's presence at a compound in the town of Abbottabad (pictured), prior to the U.S. raid that killed him in 2011 . It centers on the death of Suleman Afridi, at a hospital in Pakistan's rugged Khyber Agency region in 2005, and was brought by the man's mother, a local official told Reuters. 'A woman blamed Afridi for the death of her son,' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'She stated that he operated on her son at a hospital in Khyber Agency even though he was not a surgeon, and that caused (her son's) death.' No further details of the case were immediately available. Afridi is not a relative of the doctor, despite the shared surname. Afridi's lawyer, Samiullah Afridi, also no relative, said the case had no merit because too much time had passed . since the incident. The trial has been scheduled for mid-December, he . said. Afridi's situation has sparked widely . divergent views inside and outside of Pakistan. In the U.S. and other . Western nations, Afridi was viewed as a hero who had helped eliminate . the world's most wanted man. Behind bars: Afridi overturned a conviction for 'conspiring against the state' in August and Friday's murder charge, relating to the death of a patient eight years ago, dims his chances of going free. He remains jailed in Peshawar Central Jail (pictured in this file photo) Pakistani . officials were outraged by the bin Laden operation, which led to . international suspicion that they had been harboring Al Qaeda's founder. In their eyes, Afridi was a traitor who had collaborated with a foreign spy agency in an illegal operation on Pakistani soil. The Khyber Agency, on the border with Afghanistan, is part of the semiautonomous areas where tribal law holds sway instead of Pakistan's judicial system, and the government is represented instead by a political agent. Afridi is a last name shared by members of the Pashtun tribe of that name.","Shakil Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to pinpoint Osama bin Laden in Pakistan before the raid that killed him .

Congressional staffers are readying a tough new round of sanctions against Iran, just days after President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry announced a deal that would significantly ease economic penalties against the Islamic republic in exchange for modest limits on its nuclear enrichment program. Legislative aides to Senate Democrats and House Republicans told MailOnline that there's a consensus on Capitol Hill that the Obama Administration has bent too far in Tehran's direction. And their bosses have asked for a slate of legislative options by the end of the brief Thanksgiving recess. 'Somebody has to make sure the Middle East doesn’t explode,' an adviser to a senior Senate Democrat said Monday morning, 'and no one else seems to have their eye on the ball.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Public enemy number one? Iran's President Hassan Rouhani is on Congress' front-burner as members for both sides of the aisle consider legislation that could force President Obama into a veto showdown over a new sanctions deal . Senator Marco Rubio said there's 'an even more urgent need for Congress to increase sanctions' despite the White House's posture . 'The weakest plan on the table': Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Robert Menendez backs a six-month trigger to give Iran ample time to keep -- or break -- its promises under its deal with the U.S. and other world powers . An aide to a senior House Republican said that he had already begun working with 'an outside expert' to draft legislative language that would be circulated among 'a small, select group' of congressmen. 'But this isn't your usual ""us versus them"" deal,' the aide said. 'Senior Democrats will see this draft too. And I'm betting it would be the only one making the rounds by the end of the week.' Some Republicans on the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol are also spoiling for a fight over the Obama administration's surprising pact with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Is the devil in the details? Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday that '[t]here is now an even more urgent need for Congress to increase sanctions' despite the White House's posture, 'until Iran completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities.' Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Chairman Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has so far limited his . comments to an endorsement of what another House aide told MailOnline is 'the . weakest plan on the table,' one that would include a six-month trigger . to give Iran ample time to keep – or  break – its promises under its deal with the . U.S. and other world powers. 'I expect that the . forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the Senate will . provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before . imposing new sanctions on Iran,' Menendez said Sunday. President Obama echoed this line in his speech Saturday night. 'If Iran does not fully meet its . commitments during this six-month phase, we will turn off the . [sanctions] relief and ratchet up the pressure,' he said. But . this approach won't meet with approval from many House Republicans who are . just as eager to force Obama into a veto showdown as they are to . demonstrate a tough-on-Iran posture going into the 2014 election season. An anti-Iran video caught online fire over the weekend, depicting the Islamic republic's regime as virulently anti-American and hinting that Obama's deal with Rouhani is a foolish one . Not impressed: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the nuclear agreement with Iran as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within Tehran's reach . South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham captured Capitol Hill's fears about the Iran nuclear deal, worrying that a huge carrot will help Iran ignore a tiny stick. 'we had a chance to deliver a body blow,' he said . 'We're . going to be the stick in the mud,' predicted the second GOP staffer, who works for a House . Republican on the Foreign Affairs committee. 'The president . has committed us to a dangerous course of action, I think, and we're . setting ourselves up to lose Israel as an ally. Lots of members here . will be happy to paint Obama into a corner and make him veto tougher . sanctions that what he just let Rouhani weasel out of.' Peace for our time? U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (R) shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (L) at the United Nations Palais in Geneva November 24, 2013 . 'And none of this six-month-grace-period nonsense,' he added. 'Let's do it now.' Global reactions have been muted, with most world leaders expressing tepid support. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said his country 'has consistently called on Iran to exercise flexibility on the matter. We want to keep a close watch in a way to help implement this agreement.' Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said his nation 'welcomes the prospect of resolving questions related to Iran's nuclear programme through dialogue and diplomacy.' Closer to the Middle East region, reactions were more strident. Syria 'considers it to be a historic accord which guarantees the interests of the brotherly Iranian people,' the Islamic regime's foreign office said. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that '[w]hat was achieved yesterday in Geneva is not a historic agreement but rather a historic mistake.' Added pressure on U.S. lawmakers is coming from a YouTube video that has been seen by more than 1.1 million people since Friday. Titled simply 'Iran Facts,' the anonymously authored video contains a laundry list of anti-American statements from Iranian leaders, read over a series of editorial cartoon-style drawings and a soundtrack full of riotous crowd noises. During his recent presidential campaign, according to the video's narrator, Rouhani said that 'saying ""Death to America"" is easy; we need to express ""Death to America"" with action.' Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the video's creator – who requested anonymity – said that Americans 'need to know the Iran threat is not focused on Israel. That is a distraction.' 'Imagine if Israel did not exist,' he said. 'Then imagine what we would be thinking about ""Death to America"" [statements' from people who commit suicide on a regular basis and have a deliverable nuclear weapon.' House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called the deal 'dangerous' on Monday morning, noting that it fell short of the recommendations of the UN Security Council . Appearing Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' program, Secretary of State John Kerry wouldn't respond directly to a . question about whether the president would veto any new Iran sanctions . Congress might pass. 'I . believe Congress will recognize that this deal actually has a great deal . of benefit in it, and I look forward to going up and working with our . colleagues on the hill in order to try to persuade them that this is not . the moment to increase sanctions,' Kerry said. Kerry met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Sunday after taking part in the breakthrough talks that are temporarily curbing Iran's nuclear activity . Several Democrats in the Senate, . where Kerry served before joining the Obama administration, have already . expressed dismay at what they see as a lopsided deal between the White . House and Rouhani. 'This . disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that . Democrats and Republicans will join together and pass additional . sanctions when we return in December,' New York Democratic Sen. Chuck . Schumer said Sunday in a statement. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday on CNN that 'we had a chance to deliver a body blow,' against Iran, since 'the sanctions [already in place] actually worked.' 'But this interim deal gives the Iranians $7 billion in cash,' he complained, 'and it leaves in place one of the most sophisticated enrichment programs around.' House Speaker John Boehner hinted on Sunday that America must maintain as much pressure on Tehran as the White House will allow. Otherwise, Boehner said, 'we will look back on the interim deal as a remarkably clever Iranian move to dismantle the international sanctions regime while maintaining its infrastructure and material to pursue a break-out nuclear capability.'","Legislators are readying bills that would force Obama to choose between backing off from his Iran deal and vetoing tough new sanctions .

A grieving mother was confronted by riot police as she tried to lay flowers at the Kenyan police station where her son was detained before he died in suspicious circumstances. Hilary Monson was marking the anniversary of the death of her aristocrat son Alexander, who died in May last year just hours after being detained by officers in the coastal town of Diani. The 28-year-old – son of Nicholas, the 12th Baron Monson and his former wife Hilary – died of a massive blood clot on his brain after being taken to hospital for treatment. Grief: Hilary Monson struggles as she is prevented from entering the police station where her son was held before he died. Blocking her way were a paramilitary wing of Kenya's police force . Alexander Monson suffered a head injury, believed to be inflicted while in  custody at the Diani Police Station. He later died . A Kenyan police inquiry into the former Marlborough schoolboy's death has now concluded that Mr Monson was hit over the head with a blunt instrument and the injury was not inflicted by anyone in custody. No one has so far been arrested, and his parents have vowed to bring Alexander’s killers to justice. Wearing a black dress with 'A mother's love never dies' printed across it, Mrs Monson, 59, was laying 365 roses between the hospital and the police station when paramilitary officers from the General Service Unit of the Kenyan Police tried to block her way. The officers of the heavily-trained unit, which usually deals with situations affecting 'internal security' and civil disorder, were forced to back down by angry human right campaigners sympathetic to her cause and critical of Kenya's police, who they claim operate with impunity and frequently commit murder. Mrs Monson was eventually able to push flowers through the grille of the concrete floor where her son was discovered in severe distress, reports The Times. The keen artist enjoyed spending time with his mother Hilary, centre, and sister Isabella, left, in Kenya where the two run an accommodation complex . Alexander Monson, a talented artist, pictured with his sister Isabella in Diani, Kenya in 2010 where the pair spent a lot of time . She said: 'There are lots of people who suffer horrendous things in exactly the same way, but who don't have a way to protest. 'People just disappear, it happens all the time. I owe it to Alexander, and the country, to stand up.' Mr Monson was arrested outside a nightclub under suspicion of smoking cannabis. According to local police, he was about to be interviewed in custody when he complained of feeling sick and was taken to hospital. His mother, who was with him when he died, says he was handcuffed to the hospital bed. A family spokesman said he was  told by hospital doctors that police brought him in claiming he had overdosed. The contusion to his skull was revealed only during the autopsy, which also found he had not overdosed. Justice: Baron Nicolas Monson is conducting his own investigation into his son's death. Right, the hospital where he died . Mrs Monson added: 'His condition, in the book, was described as normal. Then at nine o'clock the next morning he was in a coma from which he never recovered... he was handcuffed to the bed and I watched him die.' As heir to the Monson barony, Alexander lived a life of privilege. Described by his father as a ‘golden boy’, he had a degree in psychology from London’s City University and, a talented artist, went on to study at Chelsea Art College where he gained a scholarship. Mr Monson lived in London but spent much of the year in Kenya with his mother Hilary, 58, and  sister Isabella, 25, who run the Four Twenty South complex of self-catering cottages in the Indian Ocean resort of Diani, where accommodation can cost up to £800 a night.","Hilary Monson faced paramilitary police as she marked anniversary of death .

A lesbian who buried her lover's ex-girlfriend alive in a shallow grave sent a chilling letter to the victim's mother in which she wrote: 'I f****** murdered your 20-year-old mistake... she deserved it.' Ashley Barber admitted brutally beating 20-year-old Ohio college student Brandy Stevens-Rosine  before burying her in woods behind her home in Crawford County, Pa. Barber, 21, switched her plea from not guilty after her accomplice, Nichole Olmstead, 20, admitted her part in the 2012 killing. Both have been sentenced to life in prison. Murdered: Brandy Stevens-Rosine, 20, was found murdered and buried in a shallow grave in May . Guilty: Jade Olmstead, left, and Ashley Barber, right, have been sentenced to life in prison . Following her guilty plea details of . the case were released to the public for the first time including the . note sent to  Stevens-Rosine's mother, Carrie Stevens-Rosine. Barber . told a hearing at Crawford County Court last week: 'I don’t have much . to say -- I have no explanation. You may not believe me, but I do . apologize.' Miss Stevens-Rosine studied sociology at Youngstown State University near her hometown in Beaver Township, Ohio. Her . friend Krysti Horvat described her as 'like the little sister that . everyone would want to have', and said her tragic death was . 'unfathomable'. The student was apparently still devoted to her ex-girlfriend Olmstead and had shown herself willing to run errands for her. On . May 17, she drove 75 miles to Wayne Township, Pennsylvania to visit . Olmstead at the house where she was living with her new lover, . 20-year-old Barber. Moment of pride: Miss Stevens-Rosine poses for a picture after graduating from high school in 2010 . Couple: Olmstead, left, and Barber, right, became lovers after the former split up with Miss Stevens-Rosine . The . house, owned by Barber's parents, is apparently located deep in the . woods, making Miss Stevens-Rosine nervous as she approached her . destination. She texted a friend to say she had a 'funny feeling' - and that was the last anyone heard of her. When . she met up with Olmstead and Barber, they took her into the woods and . told her they wanted to show her a fort they had built. Instead, they started punching her and stuffed a hat in her mouth branded with images from graphic horror movie Saw. After . Miss Stevens-Rosine had fallen to the ground, Barber apparently . strangled her with a rope while her lover attacked her with a shovel. Following . several blows to the head, according to Olmstead, the attackers could . see their victim's brains sticking out of her wounds. They then allegedly headbutted her and bashed her head against a tree stump. The killers had prepared a shallow grave for Miss Stevens-Rosine, police said, and rolled her nearly lifeless body into it. Memorial: Family and friends pay tribute to Brandy after her untimely death in May last year . But when they realised that she was still alive, they smashed in her face with a rock and poured water into her nose and mouth. Barber . apparently said she had done this because 'her worst fear was being . buried alive' so she wanted to make sure the victim was dead. Two . days after the assault, Miss Stevens-Rosine's family reported her . missing - but police did not suspect foul play, owing to the young . woman's age. Miss Horvat had been told the address her friend was planning to visit, so went with Brandy's family to Wayne to look for her. After . speaking to locals - including Olmstead and Barber - they could not . find the young woman, until police located her cell phone signal and . tracked down her car to Barber's house. The . body of Miss Stevens-Rosine was found on May 23, and the next day her . alleged killers were arrested and arraigned on charges of criminal . homicide, conspiracy and tampering with physical evidence. Olmstead had reportedly written in a notebook that the crime 'is perfect,' and 'I don't believe we will ever get caught.' She also asked herself the question: 'Do I feel guilty?', to which she answered, 'no, not an ounce. I am proud.' Sentencing . Barber to life in prison without parole Judge Mark Stevens, said: 'The . punishment dictated by the law fits. We have to protect society.'

A representative for the network confirmed the news after backstage photos of 'secret' auditions for a select group of black comediennes leaked on social media earlier Thursday. In recent weeks, the show has seen two dozen candidates in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Making history: Eleven black women were invited to audition for a spot on Saturday Night Live earlier this month in Los Angeles amid concerns that the show lacks diversity . The New York Times reported that a . special audition for seven or eight finalists will be held Monday on the . 'SNL' stage in Manhattan. It's . '100 per cent good for the show to have an African-American woman' in . its ranks, executive producer Lorne Michaels has said in earlier . interviews. Man behind the curtain: Lorne Michaels said that hiring a black actress has been on the show's to do list . The two current . black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to . spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all . impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to . dress in drag. As a result, . there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring First Lady . Michelle Obama since Maya Rudolph left the cast in 2007. The . only exception to this came in November when Scandal star Kerry . Washington was the guest host amid the diversity furor and she played . Mrs Obama, Oprah and Beyonce in the same sketch as the show's way of . poking fun at themselves. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Rudolph who is biracial. 'It's . not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview . with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure . it will happen.' News of . the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles . and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage . hit the internet. Actress . Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes . asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live . has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the . 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . 'It was an awesome opportunity even . though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta . get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I . can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having . no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of . course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle . Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there . that I had never met,' she said. Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie . Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe . also auditioned according to Jezebel. Laughing at themselves: When Kerry Washington hosted the show last month, the first skit made fun of the lack of black female cast members on the show by having Washington play Michelle Obama and Oprah in the same skit . Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past . 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We . were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being . considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the . showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed . to the max.' Webb says she was invited to audition last summer, but was filming a television show and wasn't able to perform. One . of the comediennes- Brunson- has a fan on the inside, as Pharoah has . publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots. Supporter: Cast member Jay Pharaoh (left) has specifically named Darmirra Brunson (right) as someone he hopes joins the cast . 'Why do I think she should be on the . show?

And I believe they need to . follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year,' Pharoah told The Grio. The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the upcoming departure of Seth Meyers, who will leave mid-way through this season to replace Jimmy Fallon as the host of Late Night.","An 'inside source from SNL' set up an audition for 11 black actresses, comediennes and sketch comics earlier this month .

Many of Collins's friends and former colleagues were quick to pay tribute to the actor. Former BBC chairman, and ITV executive chairman Michael Grade said of the actor: 'He was Bodie. 'A big hunky macho character with a lovely innocence about him.' Creator of The Professionals Brian Clemens told the BBC: 'I thought he would have made a marvellous Bond.

Doctor Who star Colin Baker tweeted: 'Sad to hear that Lewis Collins has died. He was the year below me at drama school. Had style!' Brian Conley, who played Collins's son in 1999 series The Grimleys wrote: 'God bless lewis Collins, my dad in The Grimleys. A great actor and a lovely man.' Actress Daniella Westbrook also paid tribute to Collins on Twitter saying: 'So sad to hear the handsome & talented Lewis Collins has lost his battle to cancer today. He was a true gent. Sending love to his family.' Collins made his on-screen debut in 1974 in an episode of another famous police show, Z-Cars. He enjoyed bit-parts in a number of popular programmes, including The New Avengers, and played lodger Gavin Rumsey in comedy The Cuckoo Waltz. It was in 1977 when he got his big break, winning the role of former SAS man William Bodie in hit show The Professionals, starring alongside Martin Shaw and Gordon Jackson. The series ended in 1981, and the year after viewers were treated to another famous Collins role - Captain Peter Skellen - in Who Dares Wins, which was loosely based on the Iranian Embassy siege in 1980. In 1988 Collins played Sergeant George Godley in the miniseries Jack The Ripper, which also starred Michael Caine as Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline. Collins returned to television screens in 2002, when he appeared in an episode of The Bill.","Actor played Bodie in the crime drama .

The mother of killer Dale Cregan had her house bugged by police who listened to her for up to 24 hours a day while her son was on the run. Manchester Crown Court heard while officers were hunting for Cregan, who was wanted for the murders of father and son David and Mark Short, they were eavesdropping on Anita Cregan. Kathryn Smith, 25, of Droylsden, a . senior police officer's daughter, is alleged to have leaked the information using her job as a call handler at GMP’s Trafford . communications room. Accused: Kathryn Smith, 25, of Droylsden, a senior police officer's daughter, is alleged to have leaked the information using her job as a call handler at GMP¿s Trafford communications room . Between August 23 and September 19 last . year, officers recorded hours of conversations between Anita Cregan and . her family and friends at her Droylsden home. The round-the-clock surveillance captured Mrs Cregan insisting that she did not know where her son was in the hours after armed police raided her house after a tip-off from a local man who reported a 'suspicious' car to police. The recording taken in the Cregan home taped Anita saying that ‘25 officers’ with ‘big Alsatians’ had hammered down the door in the early hours of August 29 as a helicopter hovered above. A car, that had been reported minutes earlier by a local man, contained food wrappers and camping gear and belonged to Cregan’s sister, Kelly Cregan, who police arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, but later released without charge. Anita Cregan describes herself as ‘f****** fuming’ at the course of events, and sets out to identify the ‘grass’, saying ‘I can’t sit on it...I’m really not the type of person who can sit on that.’ In conversations with friends and neighbours, she dismisses the raid as a ‘wild goose chase’, saying: 'They think I know where (Dale Cregan) is, but this is the longest time in my life that I’ve not spoke to him. I have never not spoken to him for this time, even when he goes on holiday he rings me.' Following her release from the cells, Kelly Cregan can be heard describing her brother as ‘the most wanted man in Britain’. Kathryn Smith leaves Manchester Crown Court where she is charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office as the police call-handler fed secret information to her boyfriend during the massive manhunt for his friend Dale Cregan . Anita Cregan, 56, is on trial accused of procuring information from a police worker which enabled her to identify and confront the man whose call prompted the raid. The recordings made while her home was bugged include her vowing to identify the ‘grass’ who she believes has betrayed her for a ‘fifty grand’ reward. Manhunt: Police bugged Anita Cregan's house while they were searching for her killer son Dale Cregan . It even captures her receiving the text that allegedly confirmed the identity of who it was that tipped off the police – and her anger and disbelief as she is taped saying ‘I can’t believe it...(it is) one of my friends’. The Manchester Evening News reports the man identified as the 'grass' is then questioned for six hours, until 6am on September 1, by Anita Cregan. Sobbing at times, the man, who was later warned by police his life could be at risk, insists that he feared the car belonged to someone seeking reprials against the Cregans. Mrs Cregan tells him: 'I know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody. I have got inside information right? I have got a bit of inside.' Information is said to have been provided to her by Sean Booth, a 31-year-old neighbour who she describes as ‘like a brother’ to Dale Cregan on the secret police tapes. Booth and Mrs Cregan, both of Droylsden, both deny aiding and abetting misconduct in public office. Booth’s girlfriend, Kathryn Smith, 25, of Droylsden, a senior police officer's daughter, is alleged to have leaked the information using her job as a call handler at GMP’s Trafford communications room. She denies misconduct in public office in the same Manchester Crown Court trial. Speaking of the bugging operation, Dc Michael Young told court: 'The listening post was manned from 7am in the morning until the early hours of the following day, through the entire duration.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:04 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:46 EST, 25 November 2013 . Top U.S. diplomats spent months meeting with Iranians in a series of secret, bilateral negotiations that hammered out most of the details of the nuclear deal with the Islamic republic - an agreement that is being criticized by Israel and some in Congress as giving away too much in exchange for too little. The talks, most of which were held in Oman, included sitting down face-to-face with representatives from the regime of hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Associated Press has revealed. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the bargain that Iran reached with the U.S. and the five other world powers 'a historic mistake.' President Barack Obama phoned Netanyahu from aboard Air Force on Sunday night in an attempt to assuage his fears. Agreement: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry after the two helped broker an agreement between Iran and six world powers . The agreement sees Iran promising to scale back its uranium enrichment - a key precursor to producing a nuclear weapon - for six months in exchange for receiving $7billion in sanctions being lifted. Netanyahu has long lobbied against the deal because he believes it leaves Iran's military nuclear capabilities largely intact, while giving Iran relief from painful economic sanctions, undermining negotiations on the next stage. 'Today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world,' Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the nuclear deal a 'historic mistake' The one-on-one discussions between Iran and the United States were personally authorized by President Barack Obama, who has long tried to open up the lines of dialogue between the Iranian government and the United States. The talks were kept hidden even from America's closest friends, including its negotiating partners and Israel, until two months ago, and that may explain how the nuclear accord appeared to come together so quickly after years of stalemate and fierce hostility between Iran and the West. But the secrecy of the talks may also . explain some of the tensions between the U.S. and France, which earlier . this month balked at a proposed deal, and with Israel, which is furious . about the agreement and has angrily denounced the diplomatic outreach to . Tehran. The talks were held . in the Middle Eastern nation of Oman and elsewhere with only a tight . circle of people in the know, the AP learned. Since March, Deputy . Secretary of State William Burns and Jake Sullivan, Vice President Joe . Biden's top foreign policy adviser, have met at least five times with . Iranian officials. The last . four clandestine meetings, held since Iran's reform-minded President . Hassan Rouhani was inaugurated in August, produced much of the agreement . later formally hammered out in negotiations in Geneva among the United . States, Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and Iran, said three . senior administration officials. All spoke only on condition of . anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss by name the highly . sensitive diplomatic effort. The talks were brokered by Sultan Qaboos, the British-educated monarch of Oman who has been careful to maintain good relations to with Iran and the West. Some of the negotiation took place when hardline Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was still in power . Power broker: Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who has maintained ties to both Iran and the West, brokered the meetings . The deal reached in Geneva, Switzerland, this weekend is only short-term - just six months. Negotiators on both sides say that the temporary solution buys them time for a broader, more comprehensive bargain. Iran will gain about $7billion in eased sanctions. About $4.2 billion will come from oil sales. Another $1.5 billion more would come . from imports of gold and other precious metals, petrochemical exports . and Iran's auto sector. In exchange, Iran must stop enriching uranium, stop building additional centrifuges that enrich the uranium. Additionally, its highest-grade uranium - 20percent, which is closest to what is needed to create a nuclear weapon - must be diluted or destroyed. However, Iran can keep its current stockpile of 16,000 pounds of low-enriched uranium - which takes longer to convert into the material needed for a weapon. The Obama Administration claims that the six-month halt, combined with the destruction of the higher-enriched uranium, adds two months to the time it could take Iran to develop a weapon. Officials . described the first contacts as exploratory discussions focused on the . logistics of setting up higher-level talks. The discussions happened . through numerous channels, officials said, including face-to-face talks . at undisclosed locations. They included exchanges between then . U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, now Obama's national . security adviser, and Iran's envoy to the world body, the officials . said. National Security Council aide Puneet Talwar was also involved, . the officials said. The . talks took on added weight eight months ago, when Obama dispatched the . deputy secretary of state Burns, the top aide Sullivan and five other . officials to meet with their Iranian counterparts in the Omani capital . of Muscat. Obama dispatched the group shortly after the six powers . opened a new round of nuclear talks with Iran in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in . late February. At the time, . those main nuclear negotiations were making little progress, and the . Iranians had little interest in holding bilateral talks with the United . States on the sidelines of the meeting out of fear that the discussions . would become public, the U.S. officials said. So, with the assistance of Sultan . Qaboos, officials in both countries began quietly making plans to meet . in Oman. Burns, Sullivan and a small team of U.S. technical experts . arrived on a military plane in mid-March for the meeting with the . Iranians. The senior . administration officials who spoke to the AP would not say who Burns and . Sullivan met with but characterized the Iranian attendees as career . diplomats, national security aides and experts on the nuclear issue who . were likely to remain key players even after the country's elections . this summer. Israel isn't the only U.S. ally to voice concerns over the deal. Saudi Arabia - the Sunni Muslim Middle East rival to Shiite Iran - has long taken a hard line against Tehran obtaining a nuclear weapon. France, too balked at the terms of the deal - even they that nation was part of the Geneva talks and eventually signed on. In Congress, opposition in mounting, as well - from both side of the aisle. Congressman Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed 'serious concerns,' saying the United States was 'relieving Iran of the sanctions pressure built up over years,' while allowing Tehran to 'keep the key elements of its nuclear weapons-making capacity.' New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer said he was 'disappointed' by the deal. 'This disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that Democrats and Republicans will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in December. I intend to discuss that possibility with my colleagues,' he said in a statement.","Talks included face-to-face U.S. meetings with representatives from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime .

Tragedy: Mason Timmins, aged seven, pictured on a family holiday, died from meningitis . The parents of a seven-year-old boy made the heartbreaking decision to switch off his life support machine after he contracted meningitis. Mason Timmins had been vaccinated against the disease  but fell ill last weekend with a rare form and passed away within hours. His mother Claire, 34, said: ‘We’re not the type of parents who panic at every cough and snuffle, and I survived meningitis as a child so we were aware of the signs to look out for. 'He didn’t really get any better and we took him to the doctor’s as he suddenly became really pale.’ Mason was admitted to hospital, and after tests was transferred for specialist care. ‘He had been vaccinated against meningitis but not this particular type, which is a rare type,’ she said. ‘We knew there was nothing more that could be done for him, we knew we had lost him and we didn’t want him messed about with, so allowed his life support machine to be turned off.’ Mason’s father Mark, a welder, said: ‘I held him until I felt his heart stop beating and we are all grateful we were able to be with him and say goodbye.’ He said of the funeral:  ‘We asked if the car that carries Mason can speed up a little bit on the motorway, as Mason was always telling us to go “faster, faster”. 'It would make me so happy if he knew that we’d done that for him.’ The 47-year-old added: ‘We’re all mad about motorbikes in the family – his grandad has a Harley-Davidson – and we think as he got older he might have been a mechanic. He was always tinkering away with a spanner in his hand when he got the chance.’ Health officials and parents at Mason’s school, Little Bloxwich Primary in Walsall, have met to discuss symptoms and the risk to other children, which is described as very low. Anyone who came into close contact with Mason has been offered antibiotics. Mason was a pupil at Little Bloxwich Church of England Primary School in Walsall, above . Mrs Timmins, a teaching assistant, stressed: ‘We don’t want parents to panic about meningitis. ‘Please read our story and be aware of the symptoms and get medical help if you feel your child is really unwell. ‘But what happened to Mason is rare and people shouldn’t forget that.’ There are about 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and related septicaemia in the UK every year. One in ten prove fatal. Symptoms can include a high temperature, severe headache, a dislike of bright lights, a stiff neck, aches and pains, drowsiness and a purple rash of spots or small bruises which do not fade if pressed. In small babies, a refusal to feed or a high-pitched cry can also be a sign of infection.","Mason Timmins, aged seven, died of a rare form of meningitis .

The wife of the £874,000-a-year governor of the Bank of England is urging people to protect the environment by buying organic clothes. Although they are more expensive, Diana Carney argues it is better to pay more for your outfits than to wear a ‘toxic second skin’ of synthetic garments. Writing on her blog, Eco Products That Work, economist and green campaigner Mrs Carney said ‘how to green what we wear’ [sic] is a ‘huge issue in our fast fashion world’. Diana Carney, right, pictured with her husband Mark, urged people to buy organic clothes on her blog, arguing it is better to spend more money on the more expensive garments rather than wear a 'toxic second skin' of synthetic items . She favours the denim brand  Monkee Genes which sells a range  of trousers ‘certified organic by the Soil Association’. Mrs Carney wrote: ‘Looking at all the benefits of organic fabrics, it’s a wonder we don’t demand them more vociferously. 'Who wants to carry around a toxic second skin each day?’ Mark Carney took over his role as the new Bank of England governor in July . She said that a lot of clothing  production causes a ‘trail of devastation’ in areas where cotton is grown, adding: ‘It is close to Christmas and I do not want to depress you, so let’s think about what we can all do. ‘Most obvious is to buy fewer items, though this is not what the retailers have in mind for us. ‘Second, we can try to source fabrics that are less damaging for the environment and workers. ‘But that’s not easy. Like it or not, our personalities and self-image are closely tied to what we wear. That means that making “sacrifices” in this area can be hard. ‘Low prices tempt us all in (I am by no means exempt here). 'But in the textiles world, prices are nowhere near high enough to reflect the true costs of production.’ British-born Mrs Carney, whose husband Mark is Canadian, previously suggested that reusable fabric gift wrap is preferable to wrapping paper. She also told how, instead of splashing out on new stationery for their four children’s first day at school in the UK, she recycled pencils and reused ring-binders. Mr Carney’s pay packet includes a £250,000-a-year housing allowance. After tax, this works out as £11,041 a month towards the rent on their six-bedroom £3million home.","Diana Carney has urged people to protect the environment .

But look beyond the sandbags and rubble and there is a reminder of the grandeur once enjoyed in this Aleppo home devastated by civil war. An ornate gold gilt dressing table which would have once taken pride of place in this room now stands among debris, its mirrors cracked, while heavy draped curtains hang precariously off a rail. The Free Syrian Army soldier positions himself on an equally elaborate chair behind cover protecting himself as well as the lavish furniture and ornaments which lie hidden inside. Faded grandeur: A Free Syrian Army fighter takes up position inside a room as he aims his weapon behind sandbags in the old city of Aleppo . Aleppo, perhaps Syria's most illustrious of cities, was home to many of the country's rich. Located among the olive groves and pistachio trees of northwest Syria, it had a population of about three million in peacetime. Now hundreds of thousands have fled the industrial city which has been transformed into a battlefield. Today the Israeli military announced that its troops have come under attack from Syria and have fired back in retaliation. It said a mortar round landed on the Israeli side of the frontier today before gunfire targeted an Israeli patrol. There were no injuries on the Israeli side. However, troops returned fire at their attackers in Syria. Preparations: A Free Syrian Army fighter fills a bag with sand from a tunnel that is being dug, in Deir al-Zor, eastern Syria . Gunfire and mortar rounds from Syria have hit inside the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights before. Israel believes most of the fire is spillover from the Syrian civil war. But in some cases, it has accused forces in Syria of intentionally firing into the Golan. Israel has generally kept its distance from the civil war, saying it has no interest getting dragged into a conflict where nearly all factions involved are hostile to Israel. The leader of Syria's main Western-backed opposition group received an onslaught of criticism this week within minutes of opening a Twitter account. 'Welcome to Twitter Mr. Western Puppet,' one comment to Ahmad al-Jarba read. There was also mocking on Jarba's username 'PresidentJarba.' 'I find it disturbing you are calling yourself president already,' one read. Another read: '100,000 Syrians martyrs and you ... still issue `warnings.' No wonder ... Assad is still standing.' Taking some time out: Free Syrian Army fighters drink tea as they sit around a fire in Deir al-Zor, in eastern Syria . Others called him a Saudi stooge and scorned the opposition's perceived ineffectiveness. The comments reflect the deep disillusionment and distrust that many Syrians have come to feel toward the Syrian National Coalition, Syria's main opposition group in exile. They also underline the predicament of who will represent the Syrian opposition at an upcoming peace conference in Geneva marking the first face-to-face meeting between Syria's warring sides. The Geneva talks have raised the possibility of a negotiated end to a conflict activists say has killed more than 120,000 people. But with a fractured opposition, many have little hope for strong negotiations with emissaries of President Bashar Assad. 'Each of them represents himself and maybe his wife,' said an anti-government activist in the central Homs province, who uses the pseudonym Abul Hoda. 'Nobody here pays any attention to what they say.' A Free Syrian Army fighter throws an improvised bomb towards forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Deir al-Zor, eastern Syria on December 1 . The Syrian National Coalition is seen by many as a disparate group of out-of-touch exiles with inflated egos and non-Syrian allegiances. Syrians often deride it as the 'five-star-hotel opposition' for spending more time meeting in luxury hotels than being on the ground in Syria. Damascus-based opposition groups call members of the coalition traitors for demanding U.S. military airstrikes against Syria following a chemical weapons attack in August that killed hundreds. But groups known as the 'internal opposition' are themselves seen as aging and submissive to Assad's government, incapable of playing an effective opposition role for fear of arrest. More importantly, the rebel factions that hold the real power on the ground won't go to Geneva. Some of the most powerful Islamic brigades have distanced themselves from the coalition. Residents inspect their home that was damaged by what activists said was shelling from forces loyal Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad in Qatana, Aleppo . Meanwhile, rebels are losing ground to a crushing government military offensive. 'Given the lack of unity amongst the opposition, the West and regional allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia will struggle to establish a representative negotiation partner that is willing to engage with the Syrian government,' said Torbjorn Soltvedt, a senior analyst at the British risk analysis firm Maplecroft. He added that negotiations likely will prove futile until there is a significant shift in the balance of power on the ground. 'As such, the Syrian conflict is still likely to be decided on the battlefield,' he said. The Syrian foreign ministry said this week that it will send a high-level delegation to the talks with clear directives from Assad. Although it hasn't said who will be going, Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem is expected to head the delegation. It is much less clear who from the opposition side will be at the talks. Their deep splits will make it extremely difficult to select a unified opposition delegation. Western leaders have made clear they expect the coalition to be the chief negotiator on the opposition side at the conference, set for January 22. The group has called on others to participate in a delegation under its command. Two Free Syrian Army fighters relax and drink tea as they sit around a fire in Deir al-Zor, in eastern Syria . 'The coalition will form the whole opposition delegation and it will lead this delegation. This is not up for discussion,' senior coalition member Ahmad Ramadan said. 'The coalition is the only side responsible for that.' The U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has said that the coalition will play a very important role in forming the delegation. 'But I have always said that the delegation has to be credible and representative, as representative as possible,' he said in Geneva last month. Hassan Abdul-Azim, a veteran opposition figure in Syria who leads the Syria-based National Coordination Body for Democratic Change, said his group was ready to go to Geneva with a unified delegation made up of internal and external opposition group. But he said the coalition rejected the idea because it considers itself the only legitimate representative. Many smaller opposition groups, including Kurdish parties, have not decided whether they will go and who will represent them. Conflict: Fighters from the Free Syrian Army dig a tunnel in Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria . The coalition has said it will meet in Istanbul in mid-December to discuss the makeup of the delegation. But members of the group itself are split on the whole concept of a peace conference. Some of its senior members insist that Assad should step down and stand trial before any talks. 'In Europe, a train crash leads to government resignation. What about destroying half of Syria, displacing half its people and the killing and maiming of a million people?' asked opposition figure Kamal Labwani. 'I am totally opposed to the Geneva conference.' Many believe the talks - if they go ahead - will be pointless, particularly now that Assad's forces have the upper hand in the fighting on the ground. The talks aim to establish a transitional government that would take over the country. But the opposition insists Assad must step aside. General Salim Idris, the commander of the coalition's military wing known as the Free Syrian Army, said his faction will not take part in the talks and will not stop fighting until Assad is brought down by force.","Israeli military announced today that its troops have come under attack from Syria and have fired back in retaliation .

A mother-of-five who was dismissed from her GP's surgery with tennis elbow has now been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. Jill Goodrum, 46, was told to ignore the pain she felt lifting her arms, described by her doctor as a minor strain. But last month she went into hospital after finding a bone-like lump the size of a rib near her breast - and was told she has less than eight years to live. Distraught: Jill Goodrum, 46, is warning others to watch out for signs themselves after she was wrongly diagnosed with tennis elbow after already contracting cancer in her lymph nodes . Following biopsies, mammograms and full body scans, hospital staff found the disease has been spreading in her lymph nodes and liver for years and that there is nothing they can do to cure her. And they revealed the tennis elbow diagnosed two years ago was in fact a symptom of aggressive cancer in the lymph nodes - which could have been stopped. 'It is just horrific,' said Mrs Goodrum, mother to James, 29, Lyndsey, 26, Jemma, 19, Amy, eight, and Grace, three. 'If I’d caught it earlier there may have been a cure. As it stands I just have to accept my lot. 'When . I found out it was terminal I sat in the car park at the hospital for . about an hour unable to let go of the wall I was holding onto. 'Nothing is the same for me now. 'My world has completely changed - I’ve lost me, my identity, my life as I knew it.' Mrs Goodrum, who has four grandchildren, visited her GP in 2011 after her elbow became unbearably sore and tender. Six weeks ago, back in hospital, she was told the cancer is now too aggressive and invasive to treat. Trying to be positive: Mrs Goodrum says she wants to focus on the good points of her life and spend time with her children, including three-year-old Grace (left in right-hand picture) and eight-year-old Amy (right) She was predicted eight years to live - but that was before the disease was found in her liver. She was referred to a physiotherapist several months ago after the pain in her shoulder became unbearable. She . said: 'I was referred to a physio as I had unbearable pain in my . shoulder which I was told was a trapped nerve in my neck - I couldn't . lift my hand. 'This . turned out to be nerve damage caused by the cancer. When I was diagnosed . it was pretty traumatic as I was told I had secondary breast cancer.' One month into treatment Mrs Goodrum, from Plymouth, is grappling to come to terms with the ramifications of the shocking blunder - and stay strong for her children. Weakened after undergoing three different kinds of chemotherapy - one of which gave her an allergic reaction - she has had to ask her mother to move in, and could not attend her daughters' nativity. 'It’s a very different world now,' she said. 'I’m 46 and I’m never going to get old and the fact that I have two small children is very hard to deal with too. Gruelling: Eight weeks into treatment, Mrs Goodrum has told how she could not go to see her daughters' nativity and has had to ask her mother to move in. She has to be strong for her children and grandchildren . 'I’m never going to see them grow up. My children are going to lose their mummy. 'My older children are obviously traumatised by my diagnosis but they are very supportive.' 'My mum now lives with us through the week to look after me and help take the children to school and pick them up. 'This week Amy and Grace were performing in their nativities and I wasn’t well enough to go. 'I’ve watched every single thing they have both done. 'That is a very real consequence of terminal cancer.' Last week, as the treatment intensifies, Mrs Goodrum asked her mother to shave her head. 'Me and my mum just wept the whole way through,' she said. 'My littlest ones got especially upset when I lost my hair. 'They told me that I looked like a daddy. 'It’s been very hard for them because their mummy doesn’t look the same and is very ill. 'They are sad that their mummy is not like she was.' Despite what has happened, Mrs Goodrum says she does not blame doctors for misdiagnosing her but wants to warn others to check themselves more regularly so they don't make the same mistake. She said: 'I don't think the doctors could have really foreseen the cancer. I bear no ill-feeling towards them. 'If I had known sooner it may not have travelled but I'm concentrating on trying to raise awareness of cancer as it's affected my life unbelievably. 'I want to ensure people check themselves for lumps and bumps more regularly so families don't have to go through what I'm going through.'

A 23-year-old man who was jailed for attempted murder has taunted police by posting pictures of drunken nights out with friends on his Facebook - after going on the run from prison. Michael McInnes, 23, failed to return from home leave from Castle Huntly prison near Dundee almost a fortnight ago. But rather than going into hiding, McInnes has been boasting about his drinking exploits on the social networking site since absconding.

Despite being on the run from prison, McInnes has been posting pictures with friends on his Facebook page . McInnes, circled, even posted a picture on his Facebook page of a night out at a local nightclub three days after he went on the run . According to the Daily Record, brazen McInnes even risked a visit to one of his favourite nightclubs in Bellshill, Lanarkshire, three days after he absconded and posted a picture of him with his arm around other revelers online. Clearly amused by McInnes's posts, one of his Facebook friends commented: 'Your the hide n seek champion lol x' (sic). Another posted: 'Your daft hahahaha' (sic). McInnes, who posted a link to a newspaper story about his escape online, was jailed for six years in 2010 after leaving Kevin McNee brain damaged after repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head in a vicious attack. He had previous convictions for violent offences. Mr McNee spent three months in hospital following the attack and a further nine months in a rehabilitation centre for brain injury victims. McInnes brazenly shared a link to a newspaper article about him being on the run from prison on his Facebook profile . Another image of McInnes apparently enjoying himself while on the run which appeared on Facebook . Despite being given an extended sentence because he was deemed likely to refoffend, McInnes was allowed to leave jail on home visits within three years. The mother of McInnes's victim, Agnes McNee told the Daily Record: 'He's a very dangerous man and the judge said he was capable of doing it again. 'He should never have been in an open prison, he should have been kept in a secure jail because he's a danger to the public. 'When we saw on Facebook that he had been celebrating with his friends at a club, it just made us sick.' The Scottish Prison service has faced criticism from both Scottish Conservatives and Labour over the decision to allow McInnes on home leave. But a spokesman said that it would be 'inappropriate to comment' while an investigation is ongoing when contacted by MailOnline today.","Michael McInnes was jailed for six years for attempted murder in 2010 .

A giggle, a chuckle or a full-blown guffaw, we’re told laughter is the best way to  deal with the stress and strain life throws at you. But according to researchers, laughter might not be the best medicine – and could even lead to serious health complications. Scientists from Oxford University said a woman with racing heart syndrome collapsed and died after getting the giggles. According to researchers, laughter might not be the best medicine - and could even lead to serious health complications . And laughing 'fit to burst' has been found to cause possible heart rupture, a torn gullet and epileptic seizures. A quick intake of breath during laughing can provoke an asthma attack, while some people have suffered from incontinence and even hernias. Clowns were sent into a hospital as part of the research . The paper added: ‘It remains to be seen whether sick jokes make you ill and dry wit causes dehydration.’ During one test clowns were sent into hospitals to entertain patients. And the results showed a dose of 'genuine laughter' for a whole day could help shed the pounds by burning 2000 calories. And 36 per cent of would-be mums undergoing IVF treatment got pregnant after a visit from the red-nosed jokers compared to just 20 per cent in a control group. Tittering was also linked with lowering blood sugar in diabetic patients and reducing arterial wall stiffness, which helps relieve tension. The researchers say their findings challenge the view that laughter can only be beneficial but do add that humour in any form carries a ""low risk of harm and may be beneficial"". The paper was published in the Christmas edition of The British Medical Journal.","One woman with racing heart syndrome died after laughing .

Winners: Graham Nield, 55, and Amanda Vickers, 48, celebrate winning £6,676,215 last year . When Graham and Amanda Nield won £6.6million on the lottery, they could have bought fancy cars or wardrobes full of designer clothes. But the couple simply can’t shake their thrifty ways and call being rich ‘a headache’. They still buy their clothes from markets and charity shops – a £6 skirt and £2 jumper are recent bargains – and scour car boot sales. And they’ll stick to their usual £50 limit on Christmas gifts. Mr Nield is giving his wife four new tyres on her car, saying: ‘I got them at a discount.’ Mrs Nield, 48, said: ‘I can’t change my habits. My friend took me to Harvey Nichols in Leeds and I nearly passed out at the prices.’ Her recent purchases have included . buying herself a new skirt - costing £6 from the local market - and . jumpers for her husband from the same place are usually priced £2. While . he bought her a £3 pair of second hand shoes from a charity shop, . although they had caught his eye because they were the same style as the . ones she wore on their first date. The divorcees have five children between them from previous relationships and 13 grandchildren. They . lived together in Batley, West Yorkshire, for years and Mr Nield, 56, . finally plucked up the courage to propose shortly after hitting the . jackpot last August. With their newly-won riches the couple could have chosen an exotic location anywhere in the world to tie the knot, but true to form they went for the simple option. The Register Office ceremony took place at Dewsbury Town Hall and was attended only by immediate family. Mrs Nield even saved money by wearing a dress borrowed from a friend and Mr Nield wore a suit several years old. They now have the money to buy a fleet of cars, but she drives a two-year-old Hyundai and he has a five-year-old Kia. Mr Nield said: ‘People keep asking me if I am going to get a Ferrari or a Lamborghini, but what would be the point. We just want to be comfortable, we are so used to living within our means.’ Spend: They refuse to splurge on Christmas presents or their wedding, preferring their normal lifestyle . Commenting on becoming multi-millionaires, he added; ‘It is a headache. The money generates a whole new avenue of problems. We have a solicitor and a financial advisor and we have regular meetings but at the moment it is just sitting in the bank.’ The couple previously had a joint income of around £50,000, but could only afford to rent their home. That has now changed and the one exception to their refusal to splash the cash on themselves has been in buying a house. They are having a three-bedroom bungalow built for them to live with Mrs Nield’s parents. Her 72-year-old father James is in the late stages of Alzheimer’s Disease after suffering from it for a decade and her mother Joan is recovering from cancer and has severe arthritis. They hope one day to start a business, but the win has enabled Mrs Nield and her husband to quit their jobs to become carers. ‘Amanda is determined to look after her parents herself and the easiest way to support her in doing that is to move in with them,’ he said. The couple have also fulfilled an ambition to buy each of their children a house as well. However, with Christmas approaching they haven’t changed their customary budget for presents of £50 per person in the family. And Mr Nield doesn’t have to worry about what to get his wife because he’s already spent money on her. ‘I have put four new tyres on Amanda’s car,’ he said. ‘I got them at a discount.’","Graham, 55, and Amanda Nield, 48, said they cannot handle expensive shopping and prefer to live the way they did before their win last August .

One of the Government’s first flagship free schools was axed yesterday after inspectors condemned its poor teaching standards. The Discovery New School in Crawley, West Sussex, was among the first free schools to open under the Coalition in 2011. However, it will now be the first to be closed down after the Department for Education decided to terminate its funding, and  parents of the 65 pupils will be forced to find places elsewhere from April. Free schools are state-funded but free of local authority control, and can be set up by parents, groups of teachers and charitable trusts. Some 174 have opened, including 93 this year alone. Closure: The Discovery New School on Crawley, West Sussex is to shut after inspectors found none of the teachers provided good quality lessons . Flagship: The school was one of the first of 24 to open in 2011 . Discovery New School – which has received millions of pounds of state funding – was declared failing and placed in special measures by Ofsted in May. It was re-inspected in November when it was warned that not enough progress was being made. Yesterday, Schools Minister Lord Nash wrote to Discovery’s chairman of governors, Chris Cook, warning him that the Department for Education was terminating its funding agreement. In his letter to Mr Cook, Lord Nash said he had expressed ‘grave concerns’ about the primary school’s education standards. He added: ‘None of the school’s teachers were delivering good lessons and all were still consistently inadequate or required improvement.’ The letter said it was also unclear whether the trust running the school, which was supposed to be part of the Montessori movement, had identified what was needed to make improvements. It said: ‘The staff are currently unable to deliver teaching and learning even at the most basic level, with the consequence for the pupils of continued inadequate teaching for an unacceptable length of time.’ Blow: The closure of the Discovery Free School is a significant setback for Education Secretary Michael Gove's flagship reforms . The closure is hugely damaging for Education Secretary Michael Gove’s free schools programme and comes after a damning Ofsted report into the country’s first  Muslim free school, Al-Madinah in Derby. A DfE spokesman said: ‘Since [Discovery New School] was placed in special measures in May we have monitored progress closely. The trust has not provided evidence they are making the changes required. Lord Nash has today notified the trust that the department will terminate its funding agreement at the end of the spring term. Plans for the first new grammar school in 50 years were thrown out yesterday. Tory councillors in Kent hoped to use newly relaxed Coalition rules on school expansions to create an ‘annexe’ to an existing grammar in Sevenoaks that could take up to 1,300 pupils. But the Department for Education dismissed the plan, saying it was the ‘establishment of a new selective school’ rather than an expansion, which is not allowed by law. Campaigners reacted angrily,  claiming that the law needs to be changed to give parents choice over their children’s education. ‘We are now working with West Sussex County Council to ensure the children have suitable alternatives in place and their transition is as smooth as possible.’ Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘When a school closes it is the children who suffer and their education that is affected. There will be many worried parents in the run-up to Christmas concerned about what this means for their child’s education. ‘The blame for the closure of this school lies squarely with Michael Gove and his free school programme, which has failed to ensure schools opened under the policy can provide a decent standard of education.’ Philip Bujak, chief executive of the  Montessori St Nicholas Charity, said: ‘We advised the DfE to allow us to oversee the implementation of the Montessori element and curriculum. ‘That advice was ignored and the result is the waste of a large amount of money, the name of Montessori tarnished and a large number of parents very badly let down.’","Discovery New School in West Sussex to close by April next year .

It may seem unlikely as the annual Christmas spending spree gets under way, but a survey has found the British are among the least materialistic in the world. Out of 20 countries, people in the UK were ranked third least concerned with material things, whereas China was top, followed by India and Turkey. More than 16,000 people including 1,000 in the UK, were asked whether they agreed with the sentence: ‘I measure my success by the things I own’. Least materialistic? A study found the UK is one of the least concerned nations regarding material things. Londoners, pictured here, are said to believe money is not everything . Only 16 per cent of British respondents said yes - with only Spain, at 15 per cent, and Sweden, at 7 per cent, coming lower. Meanwhile, 71 per cent of Chinese and 58 per cent of Indian people polled said they measured their status by what they owned. People in Britain were also far less materialistic than those in France, where 34 per cent of people agreed, Russia, which had a score of 32 per cent, or even Germany, where 27 per cent of people thought money equalled success. The question was asked as part of Ipsos MORI Global Trends Survey. In other answers, the proportion of the British public who feel under a lot of pressure to be successful and make money has risen significantly during the recession, from 27 per cent in 2008 to 39 per cent in 2013. Frenzy: But it seems that didn't stop shoppers in North Tyneside battling for cut price . electrical bargains at an Asda store in Benton last month. The shelves were cleared within a minute and a man brawling was arrested . The global phenomenon is far more prominent in China, India and Turkey, according to the Ipsos MORI survey . Manic: There were reports of fights breaking out in stores across America, including this in Annapolis this year . This still places Britain slightly . below the 46 per cent global average. We feel under less pressure than . those in emerging markets and North America, but under more pressure . than some of our European neighbours, including the Italians and the . French. Bobby Duffy, . managing director of Ipsos MORI’s Social Research Institute, said: ‘As . the country emerges from recession, the British public’s concern about . the national economy has fallen. But worries about our personal finances . persist, and we are feeling under more pressure to make money. ‘Yet we do not like to see ourselves as measuring success by the things we own, perhaps because we have more possessions to begin with. 'It is certainly the case that a materialistic outlook is much more common in emerging markets. Unnecessary: Although Amazon's Swansea branch is seen here preparing for Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year, the survey showed Britons largely believe money isn't everything . 'And the fact that most Britons remain . optimistic about their own lives suggests that we may actually believe . that money isn’t everything.’ People remain relatively pessimistic about Britain over the next year - with just 25 per cent saying they were optimistic. However, 61 per cent of Britons were optimistic about themselves and their families over the next 12 months, in line with the global average of 59 per cent. Optimism about the country’s prospects is highest in India at 53 per cent, Canada (47 per cent) and Australia (47 per cent), while Spain (12 per cent), Italy (ten per cent) and France (nine per cent) were the least optimistic. The same three European countries were in the bottom five on personal optimism, with Japan (40 per cent) and South Korea (39 per cent) even lower.","Survey said UK third least worried about shopping after Spain and Sweden .

A father has been refused permission to build an extension so his brain damaged son can get round-the-clock care because councillors say it would spoil the character of an upmarket neighbourhood. Special constable Reece Clarke, 21, from Thorpe Bay, Essex, suffered devastating brain injuries as the passenger in a police patrol car crash in July 2011. More than two years on, he is still in rehabilitation unit in Surrey and his father, Steve, applied for the bungalow extension so nurses could care for him there. The father of Reece Clarke, 21, was refused permission to build an extension on to his bungalow in Thorpe Bay, Essex, so that his brain damaged son (pictured) can get round-the-clock care at home . Reece Clarke was 19 when, in July 2011, the squad car he was travelling in crashed and flipped over in Broadmayne, Basildon. The special constable, based in Billericay and Wickford, was left with a brain injury, and multiple fractures. He was treated at Southend Hospital before his parents won a fight to get him treatment in a rehabilitation centre. Now 21, he is being cared for at Banstead Place in Surrey. A . six-figure compensation pay-out was agreed with police insurers in . April after the family took the case to the High Court in . London.Wickford-based . officer PC Ian Thompson, who was driving the car, was fined £250 by . Ipswich Crown Court in October last year after he admitted driving . carelessly. His colleague, PC Ian Thompson, was fined £250 by Ipswich Crown Court in October last year after he admitted driving carelessly. They were on their way to reports of an alarm sounding when the car was in collision with a taxi and flipped onto its side. The scheme, to build a two-storey extension to the back of the bungalow, which already has a room in the roof, and extend the front, was accepted by planning officers but rejected by Southend councillors this week. Out of 17 members of the development control committee, 13 voted down the conversion after almost 100 neighbours signed a petition objecting to it. Councillors from across the political spectrum lined up to defend the character of the cul-de-sac, whose bungalows were designed by notable Southend architect and builder F W Goldsworthy. Ron Woodley, independent councillor for Thorpe, said: ‘This application is a misguided attempt to turn a characterful bungalow into a full two-storey house. ‘The provision of roof lights to the first floor rooms and obscure glazing illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of this development. ‘It beggars my understanding as to why somebody would spend so much converting a bungalow into a sub-standard two-storey house when there are so many houses available.’ Fay Evans, Conservative councillor for Belfairs, said: ‘These are Goldsworthy bungalows. Old Mr Goldsworthy would be spinning in his grave if he knew what was happening.’ Out of 17 members of the development control committee, 13 voted down the conversion after almost 100 neighbours signed a petition objecting to it . David Garston, Conservative councillor for Southchurch, who admitted considering moving to the close, said: ‘This would put extra stress and strain on Thorpe Hall Close, which already suffers problems with parking.’ Mr Clarke will lodge an appeal against the decision on Monday. An independent planning inspector assigned by the Government will decide the appeal. The rejection of the plans could delay Reece Clarke’s long road to recovery as he struggles to get over his mother’s death. The former special constable’s devoted mother Wendy, who was his sole carer when he visited home, died unexpectedly in her sleep in October aged just 50. Reece was heartbroken and his father, Steve, is scared to break the news that the conversion has been turned down for fear it could set back his rehabilitation further. With tears in his eyes, 50-year-old Steve, from Shoebury, said: ‘I can’t tell him. If I tell him, he is going to flip. It might put him back a bit. ‘I kept promising him he would be coming home in June or July. If we tell him now he’s not, he is going to be distraught.’ Reece Clarke (left) remains at a special rehabilitation unit in Surrey, after the accident (scene, right) in 2011 . Reece’s 18-year-old sister, Chelsea, who attended the council meeting with her father, broke down after the decision was made. Before her premature death, Mrs Clarke with her husband had worked tirelessly to bring their son home from Surrey. Reece struggles to show facial emotion as a result of his brain injuries, but he cried for the first time since his accident when told his mother had died. Mr Clarke, who visited his son yesterday, now has to care for Reece himself when the 21-year-old visits at weekends. Trying to stay strong, Mr Clarke, of Admirals Walk, said: ‘With his mum dying, it has put a strain on the whole family. ‘In the past two and a half years we have been fighting the hospital, fighting the insurance companies and I’m trying to get this sorted. ‘This would have been his chance to come home and get some normal life back. ‘I care for him at weekends and it’s killing me. It thought this would be the one. ‘I just feel they haven’t looked at the plans.’ Police insurers agreed a six-figure sum to buy and convert a house for Reece in April. But no work can start until the plans are agreed. Reece Clarke's mother, Wendy, left, died unexpectedly earlier this year . Frederick William Goldsworthy built much of Thorpe Bay, including the Burges Estate. Southend historian Arthur Woodward said Goldsworthy properties were characterised by a gothic, almost church-like arch at the front door, often with intricate carvings all around them. Another trademark feature is tuck pointing, a highly-skilled and refined method of pointing, or re-pointing, red brickwork. A thin pencil line of mortar will then separate the bricks to form a precise, raised, profile. This practice is rarely used on new properties nowadays. Oak beams were another stand-out feature of the properties, and also play a major part of the bungalow on Thorpe Hall Close. Mr Goldsworthy’s son Jeff continues the family firm F W Goldsworthy in Christchurch Road, Southchurch. Mr Woodward said: 'It’s fair to say he built good quality properties across Southend.'","Father refused permission to extend house in upmarket neighbourhood .

Confused and unable to see, the 55-year-old was rushed to the emergency room where she complained of headaches and severe dizziness.

'Pavlonian response': Israel has denied claims by Hezbollah that it killed one of the Lebanese group's top commanders, Hassan Hawlo al-Lakiss (pictured), at his house near Beirut . Israel today denied allegations by Hezbollah that it was behind the assassination of one of the Lebanese Shiite movement's top commanders near Beirut. Hassan Hawlo al-Lakiss, who was shot from close range by a silenced gun as he arrived home at around midnight in the Hadath district of Beirut, a source close to Hezbollah said. A source close to Hezbollah said al-Lakiss had taken part in several battles inside Syria for President Bashar Al-Assad during the country's civil war. He was the most senior Hezbollah figure to be assassinated since Imad Mughniyeh was killed in a Damascus bombing in 2008, which the group also blamed on Israel. Both men were part of Hezbollah's secretive top leadership. Israel's foreign ministry spokesman . Yigal Palmor told the AFP news agency: 'This is yet another Pavlovian . response from Hezbollah, which makes automatic accusations (against . Israel) before even thinking about what's actually happened. 'Israel has nothing to do with this.' Hezbollah . earlier today announced that Lakiss had been assassinated during the . night at his house in the Hadath region, east of Beirut. 'Direct . accusation is aimed of course against the Israeli enemy which had tried . to eliminate our martyred brother again and again and in several places . but had failed, until yesterday evening,' a Hezbollah statement said. Israel's Energy Minister Silvan Shalom reiterated Palmor's denial, telling public radio: 'Israel has nothing to do with this. Midnight attack: Lebanese residents gather near the scene where al-Lakiss was gunned down outside his home, some two miles southwest of Beirut in Lebanon . Targeted: A Hezbollah flag hangs on yellow police tape sealing off the scene where al-Lakiss, was shot . 'Even if we're happy about it, it's . the Salafists who have carried it out,' Shalom said in reference to . extremist Sunni Muslim groups who oppose the Shiite, Iran-backed . Hezbollah. 'It's a harsh . blow for Hezbollah, which has tried to present the assassination (as . Israeli) in order to distract from internal wrangling and divisions in . Lebanon brought on by the Syrian' civil war, Shalom said. Hezbollah, which fought a 34-day war with Israel in 2006, also sent fighters into neighbouring Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad against mainly Sunni Muslim rebels, an intervention which helped to raise sectarian tension in Lebanon. A previously unknown group, Ahrar al-Sunna Baalbek brigade, had claimed responsibility for the attack in a message on Twitter. Tensions: A source close to Hezbollah said al-Lakiss had taken part in several battles inside Syria during the country's civil war . The claim could not be verified but the name of the purported group suggested Lebanese Sunni Muslim connections. Footage from the scene broadcast by Hezbollah's Al Manar television on Wednesday showed two bullet marks in a wall and muddy footprints it said had been left by possibly more than one assailant. Hezbollah described Al-Lakiss, who will be buried in Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley later in the day, as 'one of the leaders of the Islamic resistance' against Israel who had been frequently targeted by the Jewish state. Hezbollah emerged during Lebanon's civil war in the 1980s with the aim of driving Israeli forces out of the country and battled the Jewish state to a bloody stalemate in 2006. Hezbollah said Lakiss's son was killed in the 2006 war, which claimed the lives of some 1,200 Lebanese, mainly civilians, and more than 150 Israelis, mainly soldiers.","Hassan Hawlo al-Lakiss shot by a silenced gun outside his home in Beirut .

Illegal street beggars in one UK city are earning up to £36,000 a year, police have revealed. Scroungers in Nottingham boast they are pocketing up to £700 a week and are even spending some nights sleeping in hotels. One beggar is making so much cash he throws away food he doesn’t want and pays to get around the city by taxi. Shockingly, at least eight of the beggars around the East Midlands city are not even homeless as they callously cash-in from kind-hearted shoppers. A homeless charity that works in Nottingham has said that not all beggars on the city streets earn big money (picture posed by model) Some of them have started posing as Big Issue sellers as they rake in the equivalent £20 an hour. Nottinghamshire Police yesterday warned unsuspecting Christmas shoppers and office workers in the city to be aware of illegal beggars. Sergeant Huw Jones said: 'One of the men boasts frequently about how much money he makes on a daily basis. 'This usually adds up to a total of between £600 to £700 per week. 'We believe this man is not an official Big Issue magazine vendor but he ""sells"" the magazine in the city centre and then begs off the back of the sale.' He said another man can seen wandering the streets carrying a sleeping bag - something he does only for effect. Sgt Jones added: 'His appearance is unkempt and dishevelled but this is an image that he portrays to gain public sympathy. Illegal street beggars in one UK city are earning up to £36,000 a year, police revealed yesterday (file picture) The beggars are said to be a mixture of nationalities but mainly British males from the Derbyshire area. As well as spending their money on . cups of coffee and food police say giving directly to beggars is merely . funding their drug and alcohol habits. Sgt Huw Jones added: 'We have heard of several people who have boasted earning up to this amount (£700 a week). 'During the season of goodwill, people are understandably more generous and beggars take advantage of their generosity. 'Begging is an offence and one we take seriously, the vast majority of beggars who purport to be homeless, are not. 'The sad reality is that by giving directly to beggars is supporting a dug or alcohol habit. 'We would urge people to give to a charity who will use that money to actually help people genuinely in need.' 'This man is often approached by the unsuspecting public who give him money or they buy him food, which he does not eat. Big Issue manager Holly O'Connor said that the city of Nottingham, pictured, has seen an increase in the number of rogue sellers . 'He has been seen throwing the food away and discarding any drinks bought for him. 'When he was arrested last week he had five pasties in his possession. He also had £52 cash.' But . yesterday one beggar in the city centre - who did not wish to be named . for fear of reprisals - said not all of them make that kind of money. The 57-year-old said: 'We don’t all make that sort of cash and genuinely need the help. 'Some of them are just con men who have come in and are muscling in on our patches. 'There’s nothing we can do about it - they are very aggressive and not the sort of people you want to cross.' Jason Marriott, manager of charity Frameworks, which works directly with rough sleepers, added: 'Not everyone who begs sleeps rough and not everybody who sleeps rough begs - in fact the majority do not. 'People who beg, even if they are not sleeping rough, do so mainly as a result of significant personal and social issues.' Holly O’Connor, Nottingham manager for the Big Issue magazine said: 'Recently we have seen more and more rogue sellers in the city centre. 'They normally attempt to sell a rolled-up copy of the magazine. 'Once someone has paid they might say ""oh this is my last one, can I keep it?"" - genuine vendors don’t do this.'

The 25-year-old managed to free himself from the debris inside the destroyed army control room and single-handedly set about helping his colleagues, who were also trapped, while fighting off the firing Taliban. Brave bombardier Aaron Collins, from Hartlepool, who has been awarded the Goschen Medal after he saved the lives of 100 soldiers . Armed with only a radio and a pistol, Bombardier Collins managed to call for armoured helicopters and maintaining a cool head in a scene of utter chaos, directed them to the attacking Taliban soldiers. Bombardier Collins helped to save the lives of around 100 men in one of the largest vehicle-borne attacks recorded across the Afghanistan campaign. Now in recognition of his incredibly brave life-saving efforts Bombardier Collins, of the 4th Regiment Royal Artillery, has been awarded a Goschen Medal. Mr Collins was awarded the medal for his quick thinking and bravery after a suicide car bomb set of more than 20 other explosives in Afghanistan .

A cheating wife has been jailed for trying to hire her friend to murder her husband after he found out she was having a string of affairs. Kelly Cliff, 40, plotted to kill Carl Gallagher, 47, after she started a series of relationships with other men. The mother-of-two asked friend Dalton Bowen, 47, to arrange for her estranged husband to be 'wiped off the face of the earth' after their 22-year relationship turned sour. Cliff has been jailed for six years after trying to hire a hitman to wipe her husband 'off the face of the earth' But Bowen turned his former neighbour over to police, telling officers: 'I may have a reputation for kicking a** - but I don’t go around killing people'. Cliff denied soliciting the murder of her husband but was found guilty by a jury following a four day trial last month. Yesterday Cliff, from Aldridge, West Midlands, was jailed for six years at Wolverhampton Crown Court. The court heard how Cliff wanted her husband dead after their volatile relationship broke down. In September last year she left the couple's home with another man but had moved back in by Christmas. The court heard just four months later . Cliff was again seeing another man which was when she decided to 'be . rid of her partner once and for all'. Prosecutor Hugh O’Brien-Quinn told the court: 'She wanted him dead - she wanted to be rid of him, rid of him permanently. The court heard the mum-of-two asked friend Dalton Bowen, 45, to arrange her estranged husband's death as she wanted to end their 22-year relationship 'once and for all' 'The reason she chose Dalton Bowen to . kill her husband was because he was trusted as a friend, was a man of . violence and somebody who was unlikely to speak to police'. Mr . Bowen described the moment she turned up at his home 'out of the blue' to ask how much it would cost to have her husband killed. Cliff wanted her husband dead after their volatile relationship broke down . Bowen, from Bilston, said: 'She said she wanted her partner killed, wiped off the face of the earth. 'I have a reputation for kicking a** - using my fists - but I do not use tools and do not go around to kill people.' The father-of-five was so shocked by the suggestion that he instead went to the police on April 5 and she was arrested. Officers revealed text messages between Cliff and Bowen’s phones proved she was serious about having him killed. After the hearing Detective Constable James Connell, from West Midlands Police, said 'Cliff is a cold and callous individual who has now been convicted of a very serious offence. 'This was a very rare case for us, and I have certainly never come across one like this before. 'I have no doubt that Cliff was serious in her plot to have her ex-husband killed, even though they had got back together. 'Over a number of years he had continually forgiven her but she continued to be unfaithful and wanted him out of the picture. 'The evidence against her was overwhelming and I’m satisfied that she will now be spending several years behind bars.'","Kelly Cliff asked friend Dalton Bowen, 47, to arrange for her estranged husband to be 'wiped off the face of the earth'

Britain 'damned well shouldn't' be forced by European judges to give prisoners the vote if Parliament decides they should be barred from elections, David Cameron warned today. In a strongly-worded attack on interference from Strasbourg, the Prime Minister called for the European Court of Human Rights to have its wings clipped. The defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the Britain's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights. Warning: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured leaving a cafe in Kirby Stephen where he stopped for lunch during a tour of the north east, vowed to stand up to Strasbourg . Defiant: David Cameron, who tweeted this picture, told workers at a Tetley tea factory in Stockton-on-Tees that Parliament should over-rule Strasbourg . Mr Cameron spoke out during a question and answer session at a Tetley tea factory in Stockton-on-Tees. The ECHR has announced it is . reopening 2,281 compensation claims by UK prisoners. In February last year the Commons called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22, despite repeated warnings from Strasbourg. Since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue, while stressing that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to decide whether or not to comply with ECHR rulings. Mr Cameron said: 'If Parliament decides that prisoners should not get the vote then I think they damn well shouldn't.' He added: ""It should be a national decision taken in our Parliament.' Work: Mr Cameron traveled by train to Darlington for the PM Direct event where he called for the ECHR to have its wings clipped . The PM said the court's powers must be restricted, telling workers 'we need to clip its wings'. Earlier this month Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption compared the behaviour of the Strasbourg court on prisoner voting to the activities of communist East Germany. ‘To give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old German Democratic Republic was democratic,’ he said. But a week ago Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court and the most senior woman among the judiciary, said European judges did have the right to overrule Parliament on the issue. She said Strasbourg human rights judges must step in to protect prisoners because MPs will not do the job. The prisoner voting row has been running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate. Despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the European judges have continued to repeat their instructions. In 2010 Mr Cameron said it makes him 'physically ill' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison. And in October last year he added: 'No one should  be under any doubt - prisoners are not getting  the vote under this government.'","Prime Minister issued a strongly-worded rebuttal to European Court .

A heavily-pregnant driver who crashed into an elderly cyclist blamed the accident on her unborn baby kicking her. Mother-to-be Rebecca Knowles-Dixon, 28, lost control of her car and drove into Graham Walden, 74, on a county road near Ashburton, Devon. The pensioner was thrown 'some distance' from his bike and suffered serious chest and head injuries in the crash on September 6. Appearing at Torquay Magistrates Court, Knowles-Dixon appeared blamed the crash on her unborn child. She said a series of 'painful' kicks caused her to flinch behind the wheel and swerve in front of the pensioner. Knowles-Dixon, of Waterleat, Devon, admitted driving without due care an attention at Torquay Magistrates Court. Magistrates fined her £150 put three points on her driving license. The court heard pregnant Knowles-Dixon was driving down a hill when she felt her baby kicking and swerved into a hedge. The woman's Peugeot then ploughed into a hedge and veered into the path of the cyclist. Her visibility was also poor because there was glare on her windscreen, the court heard. Mr Walden was thrown from his bike and suffered chest and head injuries in the crash. He was airlifted to hospital with fractured ribs and breathing difficulties, but survived the incident in a 'windy, narrow country road'. In court: The mother-to-be told Torquay Magistrates Court, pictured, the kicks were 'painful' and had 'never happened before' Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said speed was not a factor in the crash because Knowles-Dixon was only doing 20mph. She said she relied on her car to do festival work and losing it would cause her 'exceptional hardship'. She also insisted that she always tried to drive as safely as possible. She told the court: 'I was heavily pregnant at the time when the baby kicked me in the ribs several times and very hard. 'This made me flinch and caused me to have a momentary lapse in concentration. 'I could not have predicted what happened. It’s never happened to me before. It’s really quite painful.' She told magistrates she had passed her driving test less than two years earlier and needed her car to take her baby to hospital to have an operation. Knowles-Dixon, who represented herself, said she lived two miles from the nearest bus stop.","Rebecca Knowles-Dixon, 28, drove into cyclist Graham Walden, 74 .

Under-strain A&E units have missed the target to see patients within four hours for the first time this winter. In further sign of a growing crisis in emergency departments, the NHS in England failed to ensure that 95 per cent cases were dealt with within the time limit. Health bosses said they had always known this winter ‘would be difficult’ but critics said that it could be a sign of worse to come. Pressure: A&E departments missed the four-hour waiting time target for the first time since April . Official NHS figures show how the 95 per cent target has been missed for the first time in 2013-14 . It is the first time that the four-hour waiting time target has not been met since April and comes amid warnings that expected winter pressures are only just starting to bite. Last week, 94.8 per cent of NHS patients in England were treated within the target time of four hours set for emergency departments, including minor injuries units and urgent care centres. Waiting times were worst in major A&E wards where just 92.2 per cent of patients were seen within four hours. Across England, 3,678 patients were forced to wait between four and 12 hours for treatment. And five patients were not seen for more than 12 hours, the figures show. Last week, hospitals treated more than 415,000 patients in A&E - 3,500 patients more than the previous week. NHS England boss Dame Barbara Hakin said the health service always knew this winter would be difficult . Dame Barbara Hakin, chief operating officer for NHS England, said: ‘It is of course disappointing that any patient has to wait longer than they should in A&E; however, we are now seeing many more patients than ever before. ‘Last week was the busiest so far this year, with 415,400 attendances and 105,800 emergency admissions - the highest number of emergency admissions since we started collecting data in November 2010. ‘We know the A&E standard is ambitious and that is only right.

The interrogation technique involved 'stern comments delivered at high volume and at close quarters as a verbal, short, sharp shock' An Iraqi man is suing the Ministry of Defence, saying it should ban soldiers from shouting or making ‘stern comments’ to detainees. Haidar Ali Hussein wants an interrogation method called ‘direct challenge’, used in war zones, to be outlawed. The former detainee’s case has been given the go ahead even though he admits he was never questioned using the technique. So far, it is thought to have cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, and the bill is still rising. Direct challenge, which can be used on captured civilians, is no longer in use in Iraq, where Mr Ali Hussein is from, and is rarely used in Afghanistan. It allows trained questioners to shout in a detainee’s face and make ‘stern comments’. The MoD restricted use of the method in the wake of an inquiry into the treatment of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi civilian who died with multiple injuries in British custody in 2003. Questioners are banned from shouting in a person’s ear and must only do it to their face, and must not threaten violence. But Mr Ali Hussein claims it still breaches international law. His case was initially dismissed by the High Court in February, when a judge criticised it as ‘misconceived’. Lady Justice Hallett said she had ‘very real doubts as to the propriety of spending precious time and resources on this litigation’. She told the court the technique was ‘strictly controlled and limited’ by new rules. She said: ‘Shouting at someone, with nothing more, is not an assault. It does not amount to coercion or oppression and it is not threatening or abusive.’ But this week the Court of Appeal gave permission for the case to continue, saying it raised issues that ‘deserved to be considered’. Despite amendments made to MoD policy in the wake of the Baha Mousa (pictured) Inquiry - a probe into the 2003 death of an Iraqi civilian in British military custody - the 'Direct Challenge' method has not been banned . Tim Owen QC and Danny Friedman QC, for Mr Ali Hussein, said direct challenge involved ‘stern comments delivered at high volume and at close quarters as a verbal, short, sharp shock’. Mr Owen said it was ‘plainly coercive and deliberately so’ and breached international law, including Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. Sam Wordsworth QC, for the MoD, insisted it is lawful and pointed out that it has only been authorised six times since October last year. Mr Ali Hussein claims he suffered even harsher physical and mental abuse after his arrest by British forces in Iraq in 2004, but accepts he was not affected by direct challenge. Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, sitting with Lord Justice Moore-Bick, gave him permission to appeal, saying: ‘I have real concerns as to whether Mr Ali Hussein has standing to bring these proceedings. ‘However, I do consider that these proceedings give rise to issues which deserve to be considered by the full court. In saying this, I should not be taken to express the view that these are strong grounds of appeal. ‘In so far as I grant permission to appeal, I direct that the issue of standing is determined by full court at the same hearing.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed that permission has been granted by the Court of Appeal. We are satisfied that the challenging approach is lawful and is subject to strict controls and safeguards.’","'Direct Challenge' involves 'shouting or screaming in a detainee’s face'

Fire: The robber later sets fire to the stolen truck - escaping in silver car as the vehicle goes up in flames . Now, he has been jailed for 17 years after also being convicted of an armed robbery that took place just nine days later. Davis, from Sparkhill, was one of three robbers who smashed their way into a home in Solihull, West Midlands on May 12, before demanding jewellery from the family. The trio hurled a brick through the rear . window of the house and then attacked a 50-year-old man - stabbing him in the arm and stomach and spraying him with pepper spray. Jailed: Davis, from Sparkhill, has been sentenced to 17 years in jail at Birmingham Crown Court . They then hit him over the head with a brick, before demanding to be taken 'to the gold'. However, a well-drilled ‘emergency plan’ − previously rehearsed by the family − saw Davis, Steven Moore and Andrew Quinn trapped in the kitchen by a locked door. Meanwhile, a daughter, who hid . upstairs, triggered a panic alarm and dialled 999. The robbers eventually managed to force the door open, before pocketing a handful of jewellery and making a dash to a waiting getaway car. Police, who arrived at . the house minutes after the alarm was raised, arrested Moore as he ran from the scene. Davis and Quinn were . picked up four days later following detailed mobile phone analysis. Their getaway vehicle - a Renault Megane, which had been stolen during a previous burglary - was later discovered behind a timber yard in Tyseley. Moore, 28, who had only just been released from an eight-year prison term, was jailed for 15 years - with a minimum of 11 years behind bars - after admitting robbery. Quinn, also 28, denied being involved in the incident, but was found guilty at the end of a . five-day trial at Birmingham Crown Court last month. Today, he was jailed for 17 years at the same court - with a minimum term of 15 years in prison.

'The judge has rightly handed down lengthy sentences to these men and the region’s streets are now safer with them behind bars.'

A woman who miscarried in a prison cell was forced to clean up the blood herself, a court heard - while her foetus lay dead on the floor. Nadine Wright, who was on remand for stealing £14 of food from a village shop, claimed she was only treated by HMP Peterborough three days later despite a nurse watching the miscarriage. The 37-year-old heroin addict, who had mental health issues and was grieving after the death of her mother, was said to be deeply traumatised by the incident. Traumatic: Heroin addict Nadine Wright, 37, claimed she had to clean up the blood from her miscarriage while her foetus lay dead on the floor of her cell less than 24 hours after she arrived at HMP Peterborough, pictured . Wright's barrister Philip Gibbs told Leicester Crown Court: 'There was blood everywhere and she was made to clean it up. 'The baby was not removed from the cell. It was quite appalling. It was very traumatic.' The claims emerged as Wright was jailed for 10 months after she admitted breaching two court orders, by not attending probation appointments and shoplifting once. She stole £13.94 of food from a Co-Op in the village of Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire, where she lived. But she said she did it out of desperation because probation officers had not helped her get benefit payments, despite her being under their supervision for 11 months. Shoplifting: Wright was remanded after stealing £14 of food in 'desperation' from this Co-Op in Leicestershire . Wright's miscarriage was said to have happened on November 23, less than 24 hours after she entered privately-run HMP Peterborough. Mr Gibbs added: 'She only received health care three days . later, after the governor intervened.' He added legal representatives would be investigating her alleged mistreatment in prison. The court heard Wright, who had 26 previous offences, battled heroin addiction since her teens and lived a 'chaotic lifestyle'. Her mother died in September and Wright, who has mental health issues, was ill-equipped to deal with the loss, said Mr Gibbs. It was not stated in court how many months pregnant she was. Paul Trotter, for the probation service, said Wright had failed to co-operate and did not attend appointments. The claims emerged at Leicester Crown Court, pictured. The jail did not say if there was an investigation . HMP Peterborough is a category B prison, opened in 2005 and run by Sodexo Justice Services. A prison spokesman said it 'cannot comment publicly on individual cases' and refused to say whether any inquiry relating to the alleged incident is being held. The spokesman added: 'A prisoner received medical treatment on the day of her arrival in prison and was seen by a GP the following day. 'We have a duty of care to all prisoners that we hold. As part of that, we ensure that all prisoners have access to the same level of NHS services as those in the community.'","Nadine Wright's foetus 'lay dead on the floor' while she cleaned her blood .

Three quarters of welfare cheats get away without punishment, official figures show. Just one in four swindlers face legal action, undermining the Government’s claims that it is cracking down on benefit fraud. Legal action was ruled out in 35,000 cases last year, with only 9,836 prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Crown Prosecution Service. And of those found guilty of ripping off the benefits system, just 4 per cent were handed a custodial sentence. Official figures show how just one in four benefits cheats are prosecuted, with more than 35,000 avoiding court . The embarrassing figures emerged after the DWP was criticised by the Whitehall spending watchdog for failing to act on fraud. The National Audit Office this week refused to sign of the ministry’s accounts for the 24th year in a row after the amount lost to fraudsters rose to £1.2billion. According to figures released in response to parliamentary questions, just a fraction of people cheating the system ever face the criminal courts. The size of the frauds has also increased. In 2010-11 there were just over 2,000 cases where more than £10,000 was fraudulently claimed. But in 2011-12 the number leapt to almost 3,000. In 2011-12, the most recent year for which figures are available, just 403 benefits cheats were jailed while 8,911 were handed a non-custodial sentence. Labour’s shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant said: ‘I’ve always thought that playing the system was the worst form of crime, because in essence it’s stealing from everybody and in particular from the most vulnerable. ‘It undermines people’s confidence in the whole system, which is why Government should come down heavily where there is real fraud and abuse.’ They are words which have come back to haunt the Prime Minister. In August 2010, David Cameron delivered a major speech on benefits insisting the coalition would take action to reduce fraud. He . condemned the Labour government for failing to tacakle the problem and . suggested firms could be paid a ‘bounty’ for every benefit cheat they . identify. Speaking at a public meeting in Manchester, the Prime Minister said he wanted to see an ‘uncompromising’ crackdown on fraud. He added: 'We're not going to shrug our shoulders and let these people get away with it any longer. 'Cutting benefit fraud is a no-brainer. That's why benefit fraud is the first and the deepest cut we will make.' But the figures show that since 2010 the amount lost in fraud has not changed at £1.2billion. However, the DWP said new penalties mean fraudsters can be fined up to £2,000 with without being taken to court. Officials . can also impose a £50 civil penalty where a claimant gives false . information about their circumstances which results in an overpayment. A DWP spokesperson said: ‘We are determined to stop fraudsters who see benefits as a way of lining their pockets. ‘We are giving our investigators the resources to catch these criminals and always push hard for the strongest punishments. ‘We . look to ensure overpayments are repaid even if cases do not end up in . court, and we have introduced civil penalties to deter claimants from . making errors in their claims that lead to overpayments.’ Overall fraud and error in the benefits system has risen to a record £110 a second. The National Audit Office said losses climbed by more than 9 per cent last year to an ‘unacceptable’ £3.5billion. Benefit fraud rose by £100million to £1.2billion last year compared with 2011/12. Overpayments due to errors by claimants and officials went up £200million to £2.3billion. In 2012-13 a total of £1.2billion was . lost in fraud overpayments, including £800million in benefits handed out . by the DWP and a further £400million lost in payments made by local . councils. In 2011-12 the figure was £1.1billion, still markedly up on £800million in 2007-08. Jobseeker’s . Allowance, Income Support and Pension Credit were most likely to be . used to con the taxpayer out of money, the NAO said, because ‘they . require the claimant to supply complete and accurate information in . order to establish entitlement to benefit’. The . biggest scam involves claiming benefits as a single person while living . with a partner, or lying about income levels and working cash in hand. NAO chief Amyas Morse has ‘qualified’ the DWP accounts as a result of fraud and error which remains ‘unacceptably high’. The accounts of the department and its predecessors have received similar qualified audit opinions since 1988-89. Mr . Morse said: ‘I am still concerned about the continuing high level of . fraud and error in benefits expenditure. Issuing an audit qualification . is a serious matter, and the fact that similar qualifications have . followed one another over so many years does not lessen that . seriousness.","Just 9,836 fraudsters out of more than 45,000 were prosecuted last year .

The Royal Bank of Scotland was yesterday branded ‘shocking’ after effectively admitting some of its lending practices had driven small firms to the wall. The state-backed bank conceded it had ‘over corrected’ its policy – as a damning report revealed its zeal to reduce risky loans forced previously solvent companies out of business. RBS, which is 82 per cent taxpayer owned, has engaged lawyers Clifford Chance to investigate claims that it forced companies into default in order to seize their properties. The allegations are made in a study by businessman Lawrence Tomlinson,  commissioned by the Government. Under-fire: The state-backed bank conceded it had ¿over corrected¿ its policy on lending to small business . On the same day, it also emerged that the bank’s lending to small businesses has collapsed by £17billion since it was rescued by the taxpayer in 2008. At its peak, RBS lent £55billion to small firms. Now, it is £38billion, according to a report by Sir Andrew Large, former Bank of England deputy governor. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘appalled’ by Mr Tomlinson’s study while Chancellor George Osborne described the claims as ‘shocking’. Sir Andrew’s report also revealed a string of embarrassing facts about the bank, including:* Six in ten loan applications to RBS are ‘screened out’ even before customers formally request a loan, more than in the rest of the industry;* Of those who submit an application, just a third are successful;* The majority of RBS managers admit they only submit an application if they are ‘100 per cent sure’ it will be approved by bosses. They are not incentivised to lend to small firms. Probe: Businessman Lawrence Tomlinson compiled a damning report on the bank's activities . The bank’s recently appointed boss, Ross McEwan, said it had ‘over corrected’ since its days of reckless lending. In a letter to Sir Andrew, he said: ‘In many cases, the pendulum of risk aversion has swung too hard to one side.’ Meanwhile, Mr Tomlinson concluded: ‘The findings of the report do clearly show heavy-handed, profiteering and abhorrent behaviour of some of the banks. ‘The evidence received does . . . indicate a far darker situation than just the existence of conditions which could lead to the mistreatment of businesses. ‘It is undeniable that some of the banks, RBS in particular, are harming their customers.’ The two reports come three years after the Mail launched its Make The Banks Lend campaign in July 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms. At the time, Lord King, then Bank of England governor, discussed the ‘heartbreaking’ way in which banks treated small firms. Yesterday Liberal Democrat Lord Oakeshott said the report was ‘a damning indictment of RBS’s failure to lend’. He said: ‘Britain’s small businesses don’t need another inquiry. They need our Government-backed bank and the Funding for Lending scheme to focus on real growth and jobs, not forcing up house prices to ever less affordable peaks.’ Phil Orford, of the Forum of Private Business, said banks’ ethics ‘continue to astound’. He said Mr Tomlinson’s claims of ‘artificially distressing businesses to gain more fees and assets before making them insolvent would be contemptible, if proven true’. Simon Walker, of business network the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Economic recovery will be secured by small and medium sized firms who have the confidence to take on new staff, expand their business and invest in the future. ‘We are deeply concerned by reports RBS, a state-owned bank, is behaving in a way that appears to put their short-term objectives over the interests of Britain’s small businesses.’ Small and medium-sized firms employ 60 per cent of Britain’s private sector workforce. Sir Andrew’s review looked at . relationship managers and credit officers at the bank – the people . responsible for lending decisions. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘appalled’ by Mr Tomlinson’s study while Chancellor George Osborne described the claims as ‘shocking’ He found that after the crisis, bonuses became less directly linked to the number of loans agreed, while there were sanctions imposed for approving applications that went on to be rejected. The changes made staff less likely to give businesses a chance, even when it was a fair risk, he said.The review adds that a complex and flawed credit process is also to blame for the low number of loans taken up by SMEs. Many who were approved refused the loans because they were not offered the terms they wanted. Sir Andrew said three sources had spoken about ‘extreme allegations’ of mistreatment. Mr McEwan pledged to improve SME lending by writing to thousands of firms about loans, starting a website on the lending process, promising to make most decisions in five days, training staff and improving the appeals process. By Sara Smyth . Chris Richardson with daughters . Maxine (right), Louise (top left) and Jessica (bottom left) Chris Richardson says his life was ‘utterly devastated’ when RBS pulled funding from his hotel business 11 days before it was due to open. The father of three said the stress of his firm’s collapse took its toll on his wife Karen, who died from lung cancer in May. ‘Her last words to me were “Promise me you will never give up this fight”. So that’s why I’m taking legal action now - they just can’t get away with this.’ ‘The stress of our finances certainly contributed to her death and I don’t know how I’ll ever recover from that.’ Mr Richardson, 48, began refurbishing the Coniston hotel in Sittingbourne, Kent, in 2008 with a £5.4million loan from NatWest, which is owned by RBS. With just £120,000 of work left to do on its car park, he had hired staff and fully stocked his 79-bedroom luxury hotel. But within the space of a week, he said his business, which had been valued at £7.7million in 2010, had been snuffed out when NatWest said they would no longer support him. ‘Despite the fact we had only drawn £4.2million of our loan, we were told we had run out of money and they wouldn’t back us any more. All of a sudden, we were forced to go into administration because they got someone else in to value the business at £2.5million - a third of what Savills [the property firm] said it was worth just four months before.’ Mr Richardson is now working part-time as a labourer to support daughters Jessica, 13, Louise, 16, and 19-year-old Maxine. His case is due to appear in the High Court next June. He said: ‘My girls are really struggling. They’re angry and can’t believe the grief we have been put through.

Monbeg Dude, an eight-year-old gelding, is being primed for next year's Aintree race after Ms Phillips helped improve his jumping technique. Mr Tindall, a former England rugby player, bought a quarter share in the horse, which initially proved to be a poor fence jumper, for £12,000. Monbeg Dude, which Mike Tindall (right) was branded an 'idiot' for buying, is now a Grand National contender . Zara Phillips (left) came around to the eight-year-old horse after she improved its jumping technique . But, according to the Telegraph, the Queen's granddaughter was won around by the horse this year after spending time with him during her pregnancy. Michael Scudamore, the horse’s trainer, who also owns a quarter share in Monbeg Dude, told the paper Ms Phillips has been ‘very, very useful’ in improving the horse’s jumping ability. He said it was the owners’ intention, after watching him race at Cheltenham last week, for the horse to run in the Grand National in Aintree next year. The other co-owners are the rugby players, James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson. Michael Scudamore, Monbeg Dude's trainer, who also owns a quarter stake in the horse, said the Queen's granddaughter, Ms Phillips, was 'very, very useful' to the development of the horse's jumping ability . Monbeg Dude, ridden by Paul Carberry (left), won the Welsh Grand National in Chepstow last January . Mr Scudamore told the Telegraph: ‘I’m not sure what route we’ll take to Aintree.

'I told you so': Shadow Secretary of State for Justice Sadiq Khan says he has been warning about this for three years . Prisons in England and Wales are more than 99 per cent full, fresh figures have revealed. The prison population hit 84,987 in the last week, up 155 on the previous week, while total capacity stands at 85,828, down 230 places over the same period, Ministry of Justice data showed. With only 841 places remaining, prisons in England and Wales are now 99.02 per cent full. The number of prisoners has fallen by more than 1,000 in the last 12 months, but a raft of jail closures has seen capacity drop by 5,246 places. In total, 13 prisons have closed since May 2010, with three partially shut, and four more to close by next spring. The Government is planning to build a so-called super prison in Wrexham, which will hold more than 2,000 inmates. Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s shadow justice secretary said: 'Making sure there are enough spaces in our prisons for all those that need locking up is one of the basics of the job for any Justice Secretary. 'The public need confidence that when a judge sends someone down for a serious or violent crime, they can be locked away securely. 'I have been warning about the risk of prison places running out for three years now,' he added. 'It gives me no pleasure saying ""I told you so"".' Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'There are enough prison places to hold serious and violent offenders for whom prison is the right place of last resort. 'Questions need to be raised about the pace and scale of change in the justice system. 'Solutions lie not in closing small local prisons and building supersized jails but in effective community sentences, treatment for addicts and mental health care. 'Cramming ever greater numbers of people into overcrowded prisons with fewer staff and less time out of cell is no way to transform rehabilitation.'

The pensions minister, Steve Webb, said new caps on the rates company management funds can charge customers will ensure 'value for money' The pensions minister today said new regulations on the rate providers can charge customers will prevent people from being 'ripped off' by expensive fund management fees. Steve Webb insisted the department was eager to ensure people were receiving 'value for money' with company pension funds by implementing a 0.75 per cent cap on management fees. He however did not reveal whether the new regulations which are to come into place in April will apply to people already paying in to private schemes. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, the minister said: 'A few percentage points here and there can add up to big money. 'We want to ensure people are getting value for money. It's not just about cost but making sure no one is ripped off. 'Equally however we don't want to drive charges so low that people can no longer get a quality product.' When asked whether those already paying in to managed pension funds would be subject to the same caps, the minister merely said the department was 'looking at a number of options'. 'We're gathering a lot of data on old schemes and seeing what the impact would be there.' Pensions expert Ros Altman said however customers had to pay more to receive better management on their investments. 'You can't expect people to manage funds for free. 'If we want innovation and more imaginative investment rather than relying on passive management, which effectively uses a computer to select the right stocks to invest in, we do need to allow some extra charges. 'Everything you do in pensions is risky whether it’s by a computer or in a fund manager. There are always going to be risks.' Leading company Legal and General have said the proposed 0.75 per cent cap is too high and could lead to customers paying fund managers over £4billion too much . Under new Government proposals, pension management companies could be forced to limit fund fees to 0.75 per cent. But, how much have those paying in already lost to hidden charges? Figures published by the Department of Work and Pensions last month revealed that a person paying 0.5 per cent in annual management charges lost 13 per cent of their savings to company fees. A customer who pays just one per cent lost almost a quarter of their savings, while someone paying one and a half per cent in annual management charges lost more than a third. Ms Altman however added: 'We are missing a much bigger element though and that what happens on the way in when people buy annuities. 'As it stands there are no controls on how much you can be charged for buying a product, and as much as three and a half per cent of people's pensions are lost when buying annuities. 'It's huge.' The pensions minister did not reveal whether caps on the rate of annuity charges would be introduced, but said the recently proposed plans were part of a necessary 'market shake up'. Leading pensions provider Legal and General have hit out against the department's proposed cap rate, suggesting 0.75 per cent is too high and will lead to people pouring too much money into fund managers' pockets. The company has estimated customers would pay over £4billion too much if a 0.75 cap is introduced, instead suggesting limits should be set at the lower end of the scale. Today marks the end of a consultation period, after which the Government will decide which course of action to take.","Steve Webb ensured people will receive 'value for money' under new rules .

Six nuns are trapped in an ancient Christian village in Syria, the government has claimed, as Bashar al-Assad and members of his inner circle were implicated in war crimes for the first time. Syrian army tanks were positioned around Maaloula as the fighting sent smoke wafting over the village nestled in hills about 40 miles northeast of the capital, Damascus. Forces loyal to President Assad are trying to keep rebels led by the Al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, or Nusra Front, from advancing. Opposition fighters have taken control of several parts of the village since blowing up a checkpoint at its entrance on Friday, according to reports by the state news agency and opposition activists. Free Syrian Army fighters help their fellow fighter wounded during the misfiring of a mortar in Aleppo on December 2, who was wounded during the misfiring of a mortar in Aleppo December 2 . The fighting is part of a wider battle over a string of towns and villages in the rugged Qalamoun border region in an effort to control a strategic highway and smuggling routes from neighboring Lebanon. The town had been firmly in the government's grip but surrounded by rebel-held territory until Friday. Five nuns and their Mother Superior, Pelagia Sayaf, were trapped in the Mar Takla Convent, which sits above Maaloula, according to SANA, the state news agency. Kindah al-Shammat, Syria's minister of social affairs, demanded that countries supporting the rebels pressure them to release the nuns. While the Observatory could not confirm the SANA report that Nusra fighters had entered the convent, a spokesman said the old part of Maaloula, which contains the convent, is now under control of the Nusra Front. A Free Syrian Army fighter runs past a dog to take cover during the launching of a mortar towards forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo . Many of the village's 3,000 residents have already fled to Damascus, fearing rebels would punish them for supporting Assad and because they are Christians. While two bishops and a priest have been kidnapped by rebels, no nuns have been reported harmed in the three-year conflict. Syria's minorities, including Christians, have mostly sided with Assad's rule or remained neutral, fearing for their fate if rebels, dominated by Islamic extremists, come to power. In the past, rebels have seized parts of Maaloula only to be driven out within a few days by government forces. Maaloula was a major tourist attraction before the conflict began in March 2011. Some of its residents still speak a version of Aramaic, a biblical language spoken by Jesus. A Free Syrian Army fighter points out positions of forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad to his fellow fighters in Aleppo . Separately, Navi Pillay, the United Nations human rights chief, claimed on Monday that evidence has been uncovered in Syria implicating Assad and members of his inner circle in war crimes and crimes against humanity. A UN investigation into rights violations committed during the 33-month-long conflict found 'massive evidence' of the crimes. 'The evidence indicates responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state,' according to the investigation. A view is seen of a damaged building in Aleppo's al-Ansari al-Sharqi neighborhood following more shelling. The words in Arabic read 'Destroy, tomorrow is beautiful' It is the first time evidence by a UN-mandated commission has directly implicated Assad in crimes committed during Syria's civil war, which has killed an estimated 126,000 people, according to new figures released by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group. The four-member UN investigative . team, which has been investigating rights violations since shortly after . fighting broke out, has in the past accused both the Syrian regime and . the rebels of war crimes. For the first time however, they have now cobbled together a long and confidential list of suspected perpetrators. With . no access to Syria, the investigators had to rely on more than 2,000 . interviews in the surrounding region or by phone or Skype for their . reports. A Syrian military soldier fires a heavy machine gun during clashes with rebels in Maaloula village, northeast of the capital Damascus, Syria in September. State media claims that six Christian nuns are trapped in the village and should be released as soon as possible . Ms Pillay reiterated her call for the case to be handed over to the International Criminal Court in the Hague to ensure accountability. 'The scale of viciousness of the abuses being perpetrated by elements on both sides almost defies belief,' she said. She warned that efforts to destroy Syria's massive chemical weapons stockpile should not distract from killings with conventional weapons, which have accounted for the vast majority of deaths in the conflict. 'This is my concern, that the inquiry into chemical weapons, which is utterly necessary, should not be used as a distraction from the fact that more than 100,000 people have been killed as the result of the use of conventional weapons.' Despite international consensus on destroying the chemicals outside war-wracked Syria, no country has volunteered to have them destroyed on its soil. The OPCW on Saturday said the United States has offered to destroy Syria's most dangerous chemical weapons on a vessel at sea through a process of hydrolysis. Meanwhile in the northern city of Aleppo, at least 50 people were killed in two separate attacks over the weekend, according to activists. In one incident, at least 24 people were killed when shelling hit a bakery in the town of al-Bab.","Six nuns trapped in convent which sits above Maaloula, says state media .

To make the parts for it, Motorola has turned to the company that made the first 3D printer 20 years ago – South Carolina-based 3D Systems. The partnership certainly has an appealing symmetry, as Motorola invented the handheld mobile phone, back in 1973. However, the Project Ara 3D-printing concept is so cutting-edge that the technology hasn’t even been perfected yet.

Ross County Common Pleas Judge Scott Nusbaum was photographed at a party wearing dark makeup, a pink dress and a gray wig, the Chillicothe Gazette reported. Local NAACP President Olie Burton, who met with Nusbaum on Friday, said the judge explained that he chose to dress as a servant while Nusbaum's wife dressed as Scarlett O'Hara from Gone with the Wind. Sorry: Judge Scott Nusbaum met with leaders from the NAACP to apologize for wearing blackface as part of a 'servant' costume . Nusbaum told the Gazette he regrets the costume and called it thoughtless and insensitive. 'Although it was stupid, I certainly didn't do it maliciously,' Nusbaum said. 'I was born in this community and I'm sorry I let my community down.' Burton said he considers the costume choice out-of-character for the judge. 'We left with an understanding that we know it was in poor taste, but we accept his apology and this is not in his character,' Burton said. What a card! Nusbaum, seen here in a slightly less offensive getup, is worried he could face professional punishment over his tasteless blackface costume . Nusbaum acknowledged the possibilities that the costume could create a perception of bias in his work and could prompt disciplinary action from an Ohio Supreme Court board if it were to be deemed unethical conduct. The rules for judges call for 'promoting confidence in the judiciary' and say that can be eroded by personal or professional conduct ""that creates the appearance of impropriety,"" the newspaper said.

Nusbaum, a former county prosecutor, said he's always been objective in handling cases. He was elected in 2006 and re-elected in 2012, both uncontested races. The county public defender, Susan Pettit, said she and her staff consider Nusbaum to be a fair judge and don't feel the costume choice is representative of him.

Residents of the small Connecticut town Newtown have turned their attention and support to the local high school football team as the one-year anniversary of one of America's worst mass shootings approaches. The Newtown High School Hawks completed an undefeated season on Tuesday night, with players dedicating their sport to the victims of last December's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The footballers have been wearing the number 26 on their helmets to commemorate the 20 children and six adult educators killed during the December 14 shooting by 2--year-old gunman Adam Lanza. The logo also features green, which is the school's official color.

The blowout win on Tuesday night gave the team a leg up in its quest for a state championship by securing top seed in the playoff tournament that starts next week. 'Our players are hungry to win the championship to give everyone in town a great Christmas present and something to feel happy about a year after such a horrible tragedy,' said Newtown High's head football coach, Steve George. If Newtown makes it to the championship game, it is likely to be played on December 13 or 14, George said. The latter date would coincide with the anniversary of the shootings.

'Obviously, what our team and community went through the past year was really tough, but we just want to put a smile on everyone's face by bringing home a state championship,' said the 17-year-old senior, who has broken all the school's quarterback records. 'There’s a lot of good things going on here . . . that sometimes get overshadowed by all the negative things that go on, but I guess that’s what news is sometimes.' The win against Monroe, Newtown's direct neighbor, was bittersweet. When Sandy Hook was closed indefinitely after the shooting, Monroe quickly refurbished one of their campuses, Chalk Hill School, which had been closed the year before, to accommodate Sandy Hook students.

The school is still home to Sandy Hook students - as the original school was demolished to make way for a new $57 million complex, as voted for by members of the town following the shooting - and has temporarily been renamed Sandy Hook. The tiny All-American town of Newtown will likely forever be known for last year's devastating tragedy. Because of its small population - about 26,000 - every resident was somehow touched by the shooting.

The ship's Lynx helicopter has spent three days surveying Panay and other islands near Cebu, where Daring has docked. It will now be used to take 500 shelter kits and 10 tonnes of high energy biscuits to isolated areas, while the ship will use its water filters to fill 1,900 water carriers with clean drinking water. Scroll down for video . British destroyer HMS Daring has docked in Cebu (pictured) near the city of Tacloban which was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan eight days ago, the strongest storm to ever make landfall . David Cameron praised the UK for taking the lead in international aid efforts as donations to the disaster appeal topped £33million and the government pledged another £30million of funding . The crew on board the £1bn ship's Lynx helicopter will now help to deliver 500 shelter kits and 10 tonnes of high energy biscuits to survivors of the typhoon . International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'HMS Daring's arrival is a major boost to the Department for International Development's (DFID) disaster experts and medical teams already deployed in the Philippines. 'This Royal Navy vessel will help us open a lifeline and allow us to help many more victims of the disaster.' A DFID flight is also due to depart East Midlands Airport later today, loaded with more than 95 tonnes of aid including water and sanitation equipment along with vital supplies on behalf of Save the Children and Oxfam. 'More British help is on its way,' Ms Greening added. 'The British people have shown huge generosity over the past days and DFID is working with charities to make sure all their donations get to those who need it most.' The news comes after donations to the UK disaster appeal topped £33million and David Cameron praised the country for 'taking the lead' in international aid efforts, while also pledging £30million more in Government funding, bring the total to £50million. The Chinese government says it is ready to send rescue and medical teams to the neighbouring Philippines, more than a week after Typhoon Haiyan struck. In a press release from the Foreign Ministry, the country said teams would depart 'if weather permitted' while the communist nation pledged just £1.2million ($2m) in aid. The sum, more than forty times smaller than the UK's pledge of £50million, is seen by some as the result of a dispute over the South China Sea islands. The collection of 250 islands, most of which are under water at high tide, have long been claimed by both countries. There was no immediate indication whether the aid teams were preparing to depart or whether the Philippine government had accepted the Chinese offer. Views expressed on the Chinese internet have argued strongly against aiding the Philippines, despite the potential damage to Beijing's hopes of being regarded as a responsible regional leader. Speaking on behalf of the 14 UK charities which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee, chief executive Saleh Saeed said: 'The generosity of the public is yet again surpassing all expectations.' It is now eight days since Typhoon Haiyan - the strongest storm ever to make landfall - struck, and virtually wiped the city of Tacloban off the map. HMS Daring, a Type 45 destroyer, will join a 12-strong team of British doctors, surgeons and paramedics are already in the crisis zone, helping to treat survivors of the disaster. David Cameron said an estimated 3,600 people have been killed in the tragedy, while another 12million have been affected. Two JCB diggers, two Land Rovers and a forklift truck were also delivered to Cebu airport yesterday by an RAF C-17 aircraft. Asif Ahmad, British ambassador to the Philippines, was at the airport to meet yesterday morning's delivery. He said: 'The significance of this load is that it is heavy machinery: bulldozers, Land Rovers, machines that can actually push through the debris that is blocking aid now. 'This is vital equipment because the Philippine military and others have not been able to bring this material here.' This afternoon a Save the Children barge carrying 25 tonnes of aid is also due to arrive in the region. Meanwhile China has drawn criticism after pledging just $2million (£1.2m) in aid. The Chinese government also announced today that it is ready to send aid workers to the neighbouring country, more than a week after the disaster unfolded.

Police have vowed to carry on investigating Ian Watkins after he admitted a series of sexual offences . Police are pursuing new leads in the Ian Watkins child sex abuse case after receiving a number of calls following an appeal for unknown victims to come forward. Paedophile rock singer Watkins admitted two counts of attempted rape on the baby of a female fan, on the eve of a contested trial this week. The former Lostprophets frontman's admissions included conspiracy to rape a baby. The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, South Wales, plotted the shocking abuse with the two mothers of the babies in a series of text and internet messages. Senior South Wales police vowed to carry on investigating Watkins after his admissions at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday. Detective chief inspector Peter Doyle said the force would 'work tirelessly to identify any other victims or witnesses and seek the justice they deserve'. He also appealed for anyone who has been 'affected' by the Watkins child sex abuse case to make contact. A spokesman for the force said today that it had 'received a number of calls as a result of the telephone numbers we published in the appeal'. He said he could not give the number of calls received or the information passed to police but they were being followed up by officers. The former Lostprophets frontman's admissions included conspiracy to rape a baby . The comments will only add to the growing . fear that Watkins's guilty pleas offer only a glimpse of the true . extent of his drug-fuelled debauchery. Former girlfriend Joanna Majic, 38, warned this week that sex predator Watkins had abused hundreds of young victims during years of secret offending. She claimed besotted female fans of the paedophile are hiding the true extent of his offending because they secretly offered their children for abuse. She repeatedly reported Watkins to the police from 2008 onwards but her accusations were not acted on at the time. South Wales police DCI Peter Doyle (right ) and Catrin Evans (centre, front) from the CPS talk to the press outside Cardiff Crown Court . 'I've always said to the police, there's . hundreds of victims out there and you're never going to find them . because the mothers are in on it,' she said in an interview. When police informed her last year that Watkins had been arrested she replied: '""You're four years too late,"" because if they'd have done something in 2008 he never would have done anything.' Anyone who has been affected by the Watkins case, or other cases of child abuse, is urged to contact South Wales Police on 029 20634184 or the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.","Police have vowed to carry on investigating singer Ian Watkins .

Republican Senatorial candidate Liz Cheney had to pay a fine for incorrectly filing for a resident fishing license and lying about how long she had lived in the state of Wyoming. The revelation is problematic for the former Vice President's daughter since she already faces claims that she is a 'carpetbagger' for buying a house in Wyoming so close to the election filing deadline. Liz, the 47-year-old daughter of Dick Cheney, moved from her home state of Virginia and bought a house in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in 2012 and is now trying to oust the sitting Republican Senator Mike Enzi. Timing trouble: Liz Cheney mistakenly applied for a resident's fishing license even though she hadn't lived in Wyoming long enough to qualify, just adding to her image as a carpetbagger . The Jackson Hole News and Guide reported on Thursday that Cheney had to post a $220 bond because she made false statements in order to gain a fishing license. She applied for the fishing license in 2012, just months after buying a four-bedroom, four-bath home that had a listing price of $1.9million. The problem with her application is that the state requires applicants to verify that they have 'have domiciled in Wyoming for not less than one year and have not claimed residence anywhere for any purpose during the one year immediately preceding the purchase of this license'. She issued a statement in response to the news of her oversight, saying that she did not know that there was a year-long requirement and said the clerk who sold it to her never mentioned it. She gave a lengthy explanation, which Buzzfeed's Zeke Miller published, saying that she was in town to go fisihing on the Snake River with a group of Wounded Warrior veterans and a news crew to film the activity so that it could later be aired on Fox News. New home: After gaining legal residency by buying this $1.9million home in Jackson Hole, Dick Cheney's daughter qualified to run for Senate against the sitting Republican . 'I didn't know whether I would fish that day, but wanted to have a license just in case. When I went in  to purchase a license, the clerk asked if I was a resident. I said yes because I was living in Wyoming,' she said in the statement. While the clerk may not have told her all of the information, she too had to sign the form twice saying that she complied with all of the rules and regulations that were stated on the form. In wake of the $220 bond that she had to pay for misfiling the form, it would have been cheaper should she have paid for a non-resident's license for $92 rather thant he cheaper resident's fee of $24. This is not the only piece of paperwork that has gotten Cheney in trouble. Taking after dad: Liz has worked in the State Department and as a political pundit before launching her bid to oust the sitting Republican Senator from Wyoming Mike Enzi . She and her husband were also two months late on their property taxes. She and her husband Philip Perry allegedly thought that when they bought their home- built with logs overlooking the Teton Range- they thought that the seller paid the taxes for the first half of the year. Cheney said that the reason for their delay in paying the taxes is because the notifications were sent to her house in McLean, Virginia, but the family had moved to Wyoming by that time. 'As soon as we learned the tax hadn’t been paid for the first half of the year, we paid the tax,' she said earlier this month.","Dick Cheney's daughter is running to become the next Republican Senator from Wyoming .

Most youngsters are now likely to be just seven-and-a-half when they are given their first phone - although many four-year-olds know how to work an iPad (posed by models) It also found around 22% of parents bought their children phones simply because their classmates owned handsets.

A Cambridge University student drowned while on holiday with his family after treating a warning not to swim through underwater cave tunnel as a 'challenge'. Marcus Hughes-Hallett, 20, ignored safety advice and decided to swim through the water-filled tunnel linking two sea caves on the Maltese coast. An inquest into the keen sportsman's death heard how he had managed to make his way through the chute, only to get into difficulty as he tried to return. Tragic: Cambridge University student Marcus Hughes-Hallett drowned while on holiday with his family after treating a warning not to swim through underwater cave tunnel as a 'challenge' Marcus, a maths student at Queens College, was on an adventure holiday with his parents David and Kristen, and younger brother, Christian. The family, from Bookham, near Leatherhead, Surrey, were enjoying a boat cruise when they decided to go swimming on Santa Maria Bay on the Maltese Island of Comino on August 23, last year.Mrs Hughes-Hallett told the inquest . how the boat’s skipper, Sebastian Custance, warned the family about . swimming through the cave tunnels as he moored up to let the tour group . explore the caverns alone. She said that Mr Custance told them not to attempt the underwater route. 'He said: ""I’ve done it and I gave myself a scare"",' she told the hearing in Woking. Mrs Hughes-Hallett, who described her son as 'very confident' in water, said the family had been told that when they were inside the darker of . the two caverns they would see a light shining through the water from . the next cave. Challenge: Marcus drowned while swimming in caves on the coast of the Maltese island of Comino. He and his family had been exploring the caves and were making their way back to their boat when he failed to emerge from an underwater tunnel . Instead of swimming between the caves, the family were able to make their way between them by climbing over rocks. They were preparing to head back to the boat when Marcus attempted the swim. 'I . heard David shout that Marcus had swum through (the tunnel) and he . shouted at me to go through to the dark cave and see him come up the . other side,' said Mrs Hughes-Hallett. 'It was about 10 metres underwater.' Mrs Hughes-Hallett said that prior to diving into the tunnel, Marcus told his father what he had planned. Student: Marcus, who was described by his mother as a 'confident swimmer' studied maths at Queen's College, Cambridge . 'He just said to his Dad ""I’m thinking of going back underwater,"" and David said, ""don’t do it"",' she said. 'He said he had already done it the other way and it was really easy. 'He was a very confident swimmer and had done it one way.' However, this time Marcus failed to reappear on the other side of the tunnel, prompting panic among the other family members. 'I think I just froze a bit, I didn’t know what to do,' said Mrs Hughes Hallett. 'My youngest son ran back to the boat. 'I don’t know what happened. Going from the light cave to the dark cave was obviously very different to going the other way. 'What he felt was a quite straightforward swim in one direction wasn’t as straightforward going the other way.' Other tourists joined in the search and after around 20 minutes Marcus’ body was eventually discovered and pulled from the water. He was rushed to hospital but was declared dead shortly after arrival, and a post mortem examination concluded that Marcus had drowned. A Maltese diving expert said that any attempt to skin dive within the cave tunnels was a 'very dangerous activity'. Barry Nolan runs Activity Travel, the company that organised the family’s trip and conducted an investigation following Marcus’s death. 'We do not believe anything was wrong with the procedure that day,' he said. 'That was the inevitable conclusion we reached.' However, Mr Nolan said that holidaymakers were now expressly told they should not swim in the underwater tunnels. Assistant Surrey Coroner Michael Burgess recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'It is possible, despite the warning given in the briefing by Sebastian Custance, that Marcus took this to be a challenge rather than a serious warning against swimming through.' Speaking after the inquest Marcus’s parents said: 'He was living a life of adventure both at unviversity and in his travels and had plans for many more adventures. 'A decision to swim back through the caves has led him on a different path. 'Marcus was very much loved and is very much missed by his friends and family.'","Marcus Hughes-Hallett ignored warning not to swim in underwater tunnel .

Mr Young suffered minor burns and appeared visibly shaken following the blaze. Reverend Heather Cook of the Episcopal Diocese of Easton said the man later identified as Sterner ‘ran in screaming for help'. Ms Cook said: ‘This is just such a bizarre incident. 'It's bad enough to lose somebody but right before Thanksgiving through a bizarre kind of fire, people are stunned. 'It's not just the parish. It's the whole Ocean City community. People are aghast.’ Reverend Dingwall, a native of Canada who . moved to Maryland's Eastern Shore in 2003, became rector of St. Paul's By-The-Sea Episcopal Church in 2005.

Michael Callan was killed at Nashville Airport, Tennessee, 500 miles from the supposed destination of his single-engine Cessna - which he said would make a simple 37-mile hop without leaving Canada. With countless questions unanswered about his death, a new one has crowned them all: he named Taylor Swift as his closest relation. Mystery: Taylor Swift performing in Nashville in June. Her publicist said she had never heard of the tragic pilot . Bizarre: A map showing Michael Callan's supposed flight plan. Instead he crashed in Taylor Swift's home city . The bizarre twist was uncovered by daily newspaper The Tennessean and was confirmed by the 23-year-old singer's publicist Paula Erickson. She told the newspaper: 'The first we heard of this was when the appropriate authorities contacted Taylor’s management about the crash. Taylor does not know this person.' Singer: Taylor, who moved to Nashville aged 14, has had a string of number ones and eligible boyfriends . The 'aspiring pilot who loved to fly', as described by his family, was unmarried and had no children. His sister, Jody Quenneville, told reporters they were in a state of shock and had no idea how he ended up in Nashville. The wreckage of Mr Callan's plane lay . undiscovered on the runway at Nashville Airport for up to seven hours . after it crashed in the early hours of October 29. Investigators . revealed it had originated 500 miles away at the Windsor Flying . Club in Ontario, Canada - and was listed as making a 37-mile journey to . Pelee Island Airport.

He . may have circled Nashville Airport for more than two hours before . crash-landing in thick fog, where his plane skidded for about 450 . feet before bursting into flames. The . engine was found 700 feet from the point where the plane hit the . runway, and the propeller - which showed signs of having hit the runway - . was 400 feet away. The alarm was only raised after another pilot saw the wreckage at 8.45am.

Those phoning about bills and services are facing a long wait, according to a study, with some firms keeping them on hold for up to almost 47 minutes. And these calls are also generating unnecessary telephone bills for customer. Frustrating: Power firms keep customers waiting for up to 47 minutes, research has found (library image) Recent price rises have caused a surge in callers wanting to change their tariff or move to a rival energy firm. But firms have failed to ensure their call centres have sufficient staff to deal with them. Research by Which? found that the average wait for a customer to speak to a real person has increased over the past six months. On average 14 out of the 16 energy companies called left researchers on hold for longer than they did when the same test was carried out in April. A spokesman said: ‘Our latest research found that the longest average waiting time went up from 17 minutes 5 seconds to over 25 minutes.’ Scottish Power had the worst single example of keeping a customer on hold, with a delay of 46 minutes and 49 seconds. Its average delay before a call was answered by a human being was two seconds short of 19 minutes. Npower, which has the highest standard tariff of the Big Six energy companies at just under £1,500 a year, had the longest average delay of 19 minutes and 14 seconds – two minutes and nine seconds longer than in April.

'I’m going to take further advice and see if I can appeal and get this lowered.’ Aldhouse admitted murdering Mr Longfellow, a decorated veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, after a fight in a bar in the seaside resort of Rawai, on southern tip of the island of Phuket, in 2010. The Briton, who had competed semi-professionally in the local kickboxing circuit, had been beaten and humiliated after picking a bar fight with the former marine, who was also a kickboxer. Semi-professional: Aldhouse, who had competed in . the Thai kickboxing circuit, murdered Mr Longfellow after the American . humiliated him in a bar brawl . Mr Longfellow's family in the U.S. greeted the sentence with mixed feelings. His sister, Sabré Anderson, wrote on Facebook after hearing the 25 year sentence: ‘It’s not enough. He doesn’t deserve to get out in 25 years. ‘He doesn’t deserve to live. I hope someone kills him slowly and painful in prison so he can never ever do this to another family.’ Another sister, Marquis Longfellow, wrote on a page dedicated to their brother's memory that 25 years 'is not long enough'. 'Lee took the life of our hero and because of his actions our family will never be able to see the light in my brother's eyes or the smile on his face. 'Lee deserves to rot... in hell. 'Don't get me wrong 25 years is better than nothing but it damn sure is not long enough for a man who intentionally took the life of an American hero for no other reason than a bruised ego. 'I hate Lee and I hope that one day karma will catch up with him ten-fold so he can have a little taste of the pain he has brought to our family.' The night that led to Aldhouse’s eventual arrest and extradition began on August 14, 2010, in Phuket’s Freedom Bar. He had challenged others to a fight but no-one accepted - until he and Mr Longfellow, clashed verbally in the toilet. A fight broke out and, said police, Aldhouse was beaten badly. The humiliation set him on a course that was to end in the murder of the American that night. Security footage taken in a 7-Eleven near the Freedom bar at around 3am captured a man looking like Aldhouse taking a knife from a kitchen bench where sausages were usually prepared, then walking out without paying for it. Aldhouse returned to the Freedom Bar at 3.15am but Mr Longfellow and his group had left. Aldhouse was told my someone where the American was staying. Half an hour later Aldhouse arrived at the Ya Nui Resort II, where Mr Longfellow was renting an apartment and, finding the American had not arrived, waited in the darkness outside. When Mr Longfellow finally arrived on a motor cycle, Aldhouse ambushed him, stabbing him once in the chest. As the American ran for his life, Aldhouse chased him into his apartment and stabbed him again deep in the chest. Mr Longfellow's girlfriend, woken by the noise, found him lying on the living room floor. By the time police arrived, Mr Longfellow was dead. A bloody knife was found 300 yards from the scene. Marine: Mr Longfellow, a decorated veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, died of two stab wounds . Aldhouse then hired a taxi before jumping onto a bus to Bangkok. From there, he crossed the border into Cambodia border then made his way to Singapore before he eventually flew to England. British police were waiting for him at Heathrow airport. He had left the UK years before after serving two years in a Birmingham jail for his part in an armed robbery, a charge that included being in possession of a gun. Soon after Aldhouse returned to . Britain, Thai officials took the unusual step of seeking his . extradition. Britain and Thailand have had an extradition treaty for 101 . years, but it had never before been used. Today . Aldhouse’s lawyer, Kampon Siriwatanyoo, told the Mail: ‘He knew he was . going to receive a long prison sentence but he did not expect it to be . 25 years. ‘He has already . expressed his sorrow to the other family at an earlier hearing and he . has pleaded guilty, so he was expecting to receive a sentence that might . have been as low as 15 years. ‘He . was not happy to hear the judge tell him he was getting 25 years. He is . now going to appeal and he will have to do that within the next month.’ Phuket provincial court: Unprecedented security . was laid on for Aldhouse's appearance in court today, with journalists . told they could not even take notes in the court room as the judge . passed sentence . Aldhouse has told his lawyer that he hopes he will be able to remain in the Phuket prison - just 300 yards from the court building - and not be transferred to a tougher jail further to the north. Prisoners who receive up to 25 years usually remain in Phuket but conditions in the jail are overcrowded - it was built to hold 700 inmates but today there are 2,139 males and 358 females there, either serving sentences or awaiting trial. Unprecedented security was laid on for Aldhouse’s appearance in court today. Photographers were banned from attempting to take pictures of him as he was walked into the back of a prison van to be driven to the court and journalists were told they could not even taken notes in the courtroom. The judge made no specific attack on Aldhouse when delivering his verdict, but instead summed up the series of events that led to the stabbing of the marine. Aldhouse stood with his head bowed as the judge read the verdict, but occasionally the prisoner looked up and glanced around the courtroom. His head fell forward when his interpreter said he was getting 25 years jail and his jaw dropped. He swayed back and forth before regaining his composure. Then he was led away and driven back to the jail. In Phuket’s main street and in the surrounding beach resorts Western tourists lounged in coffee shops and bars, enjoying holidays that Aldhouse will be denied for much of the rest of his life.","Lee Aldhouse, 30, is the first Briton ever extradited to Thailand .

Lisa Fairpo, 36, of Withernsea, East Yorkshire, is accused of plotting to kill her husband for his life insurance . A shopaholic wife plotted to murder her husband because she was on the brink of bankruptcy and hoped he would to take out £750,000 life insurance, a court heard. Lisa Fairpo, 36, texted her husband offering to pay for the maximum cover the day after the hired hitman was told the deal to kill her estranged husband, Andrew Burr, was still on, Hull Crown Court heard today. Mother-of-two Mrs Fairpo, of Withernsea, East Yorkshire, gave her husband of eight years the number of a life insurance broker, and when he rang him on her instructions he joked: 'I think my wife is trying to kill me,' the court was told. The murder, which was planned for June or July this year, never went ahead because the would-be hitman, Maikel Ward, 42, walked into a London police station in April and said he couldn't go through with it, it was alleged. Ward said he had come to his senses and wanted to stop someone else carrying out the hit. He said he had been told he would be paid £10,000 to stab - rather than shoot - his victim to make him suffer, the court heard. Today Fairpo was accused of conspiring to murder her estranged husband in what was the first day of a retrial held because the jury in the first trial held in September could not reach a verdict. Opening the case against Fairpo, prosecutor Mark McKone said that she and her lover Darren Wilson plotted to kill Mr Burr so they could collect his life insurance of up to £750,000. Defendant: Fairpo is a 'shopaholic' who was 'on the brink of bankruptcy', Hull Crown Court heard today . He said Fairpo was a 'shopaholic' with 'massive debts' who was on the brink of bankruptcy and could not get credit. Mr McKone added: 'She had another positive reason for . disliking her husband: Andrew Burr had punched Lisa Fairpo in her eye and blinded her. 'If that was not bad enough, she had a medical illness with . her other eye and there was a risk of being blinded.' The court heard that Fairpo had been with Mr Burr for 13 years and had a daughter with him, but she never took his surname. Mr McKone said Fairpo was having an affair with loan shark Darren Wilson, 45, who had offered the hitman £10,000 to carry out the killing with a knife. Estranged husband: Andrew Burr, 37, from Hull, was the intended target of a murder plot, it was alleged . He said Wilson had already been found guilty of conspiracy to murder Mr Burr while hitman Ward had admitted the conspiracy, and it was now up to the jury to decide whether Fairpo had been 'in on it' too. The court heard how Mr Burr had no idea about what his wife was planning, but that when she was arrested she told police: 'I know what this is about.' She told officers she had separated from her husband and didn’t love him, but had been on holiday with Wilson and discussed doing something to her husband to teach him a lesson for his having punched her in the eye. Hitman who lost his nerve: Maikel Ward, 42, was lined up to kill Mr Burr but then gave himself up to police, the court heard . The prosecutor said that Fairpo, who met Wilson when she fostered his son for four years, was primarily motivated by the insurance money. He said: 'The prosecution says she must have agreed to pay the life insurance to someone as without it Darren Wilson could not have afforded to pay Maikel Ward £10,000 to carry out the killing. 'The prosecution does not have to prove a motive, but the prosecution says that Lisa Fairpo’s primary motive was financial.' Ward told the police Darren Wilson had offered him £10,000 to kill a painter and decorator, but he did not know his name. He said Wilson wanted it done with a knife rather than a gun because he wanted the victim to suffer, the jury heard. Mr McKone said: 'Her husband had jokingly asked her if she was going to get Wilson to kill her and she replied ""yes” as a joke.' Mr McKone said the case only emerged when the real hitman, Maikel Ward, walked into a London police station and revealed the plot in April this year. He said he owed Wilson £1,500 for a debt he could not repay. He did not know who was to be killed, only that the victim was a painter and decorator. Mr Burr is a painter and decorator. Mr McKone said Fairpo told police although she was separated from her husband, she still saw him every day and he was a good father. He said she told police she did not hold her eye injury against him because she received so much in benefits as a result. Fairpo denies conspiracy with Darren Wilson and Maikel Ward to murder Andrew Burr between 1 January and 13 April this year. The trial continues.

Luckily, the giant space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles, or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon. Scientists have named the asteroid 1998 QE2 but the name has nothing to do with the transatlantic Cunard liner - it follows a code used for newly-discovered asteroids by the US Minor Planet Centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . The giant space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles, or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon . The asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long, or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2. It was discovered on August 19, 1998, by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (Linear) programme near Socorro, New Mexico. The object makes its closest approach to Earth at 9.59pm on May 31. Scientists plan to scan it with radar using a 230ft wide dish telescope at the Goldstone Observatory in California’s Mojave Desert. Even from a distance of nearly four million miles, the researchers expect to resolve features on the asteroid as small as 12ft across. Chief investigator Dr Lance Benner, from the American space agency Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ‘It is tremendously exciting to see detailed images of this asteroid for the first time. The asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long, or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2 . ‘With radar we can transform an object from a point of light into a small world with its own unique set of characteristics.’ The asteroid will not make a return trip to the Earth for at least another two centuries. In 2016 Nasa will launch a robotic sample return mission to one of the most potentially hazardous known near-Earth objects (NEOs), the asteroid (101955) Bennu. The asteroid, which measures a third of a mile across, comes within 500,000 kilometres of the Earth every six years. Scientists have calculated that in 2182 there is a one in 1,800 chance of the object colliding with the Earth.","The asteroid will sail past the Earth at 9.59pm (UK time) on May 31 .

Heartbreak hits different people in different ways, but what if you could track the effect your latest break-up had on your spending habits, fitness levels and even sleep patterns? That was the inspiration behind a new blog post called Quantified Breakup created by an New York-based interactive editor. Following her divorce, Lam Thuy Vo tracked her bank statements, PayPal records, and G-chat message timestamps to reveal the true impact her divorce had on her life. Lam Thuy Vo used data taken from bank statements and PayPal records to track her spending habits following her divorce. Each item category is colour coded. The size of the circles represents how much she spent and each item is located based on how 'useless' it is . Thuy Vo’s blog highlights an increasing trend for tracking everyday activities.

MacDonnell also plotted his blood sugar levels as part of a different . tracking experiment and discovered they dropped significantly around . midnight. She then plotted this data into infographics, charts and animations. According to her blog, Thuy Vo said: ‘Divorce is hard. Putting this process into numbers, images and data visualisations is helpful. 'It yanks me out of these all-consuming moments of sadness and helps me understand how, perhaps as time passes, things are going to be ok.' She began by tracking her sleeping patterns using the timestamps on her G-chat messages. She was able to track when she was awake, and asleep, based on when these emails were sent and notes were made. For three months she plotted each hour onto a graph that shows she woke fairly regularly in the middle of the night between the second and sixth weeks following the break-up, and then once again in week eleven. Thuy Vo admitted she switched between ‘insomina and exhaustion’ but took positives from the fact her sleeping became steady as the months passed. She then tracked her exercise. Thuy Vo said she felt the urge to get fit and compared it to the way fictional character Forrest Gump reacts when Jenny leaves him in the 1994 film of the same name. Thuy Vo plotted runs, bike rides and subway journeys she made in Coney Island and turned this data into animations. Elsewhere, she was also able to track how much money she spent on retail therapy over the first three months she was single - as well as exactly what that money was spent on. A second infographic, pictured, showed each of these items that Thuy Vo didn't 'necessarily need.' Highlights include a synthesizer midi keyboard and a bowl shaped like a pig . Each item on the chart is colour coded, based on whether it is clothing, items for her home or random purchases.

A rugby player who started growing cannabis to pay back cash owed to payday loan companies killed himself after his home was burgled and the plants stolen. Matthew Allott had amassed £17,000 in debt, including money from payday loans which were taken out by a friend on his behalf. The 36-year-old was so desperate to pay back the money that he started growing marijuana plants in his home, hoping to raise £8,000 from selling the drug. Worry: Rugby player Matthew Allott was so desperate to pay off his debts that he started growing cannabis. He was found hanged after the plants were stolen in a break-in . However, an inquest into the . 36-year-old's death heard how on the weekend the plants matured he came . home after a party to find they had been stolen in a break-in, and his . dog had vanished. Mr Allott sent a text message to a friend saying 'been robbed', and then told him on the phone: 'Someone’s stolen my plants and the dog’s gone.' His body was discovered the next day. He had hanged himself. Sportsman: Mr Allott played centre for Rotherham Phoenix rugby union team and before that spent 16 seasons with Rawmarsh Warriors, where he was the second highest try scorer of all time . Mr Allott played . centre for Rotherham Phoenix rugby union team and before that spent 16 . seasons with Rawmarsh Warriors where he was the second highest try . scorer of all time. Friend . Catherine Reilly told the inquest in Rotherham that the solar panel . fitter had been struggling with money for the last 18 months and owed . £17,000 prior to his death. She then offered to borrow money from controversial payday loans companies, which sometimes charge interest rates of up 4,000 per cent, on his behalf. Another rugby league player, Kenny Davis, 23, also hanged himself in January this year after secretly getting himself thousands of pounds into debt with payday loan companies. Mr Davies was out of work yet was paying sums of around £400 a time after taking out arrangements with online loan firms which sometimes charge interest rates of up 4,000 per cent. On the day of his death, Mr Davis had asked a neighbour to act as a guarantor for a £3,500 loan over 36 months. But the neighbour refused and Kenny was found dead in woods near his home in Swinton, near Salford, Greater Manchester, just 30 minutes later. Paperwork relating to a loan agreement from an online lending company was found in his pocket. And messages showing enquiries he made . to payday loan firms involving sums between £400 and 'substantial . amounts' were also discovered on his mobile phone. In August 2012, debt-ridden father Antony Breeze (pictured above with his partner Amanda Lowe) doused himself in petrol after he was harrassed for money by payday loan firms. He had racked up debts of around £1,600. The 36-year-old from Horwich, near Bolton, told passers-by who tried to extinguish the flames: 'I've had enough'. In the hours before the tragedy, Mr Breeze was bombarded with text messages about his arrears, an inquest heard, and was so worried about the debt that he lost a stone in weight in just two weeks. Police investigating his death found . he owed money to several lenders. Mr Breeze was taken to hospital after he was found by a passer by but died hours later from 73 per cent burns. She said in a statement: 'I didn’t . have any money to give him so suggested he get a payday loan. I took out . the loans and let him pay me back. These loans continued through the . last 18 months.' The inquest heard Mr Allott once had nothing to eat so Ms Reilly bought him £50 of food, and also bailed him out with cash when the bailiffs came knocking. 'He was always worried about what other people thought about him,' she said. 'His friends had flash cars and splashed money about and he tried to keep up when he couldn’t afford it.' The hearing was told that bailiffs had been pursuing him over a parking ticket, which had risen to £460 and he had talked about ending it all. 'I told him off for talking like that for the sake of £460,' said Ms Reilly. 'He had been discussing declaring himself bankrupt when he hit upon the idea of growing cannabis - he called them “tomato plants” - to raise cash. 'He was going to use the money from the sale of the plants to sort himself out. 'He was planning to register himself bankrupt when his “tomato” plants were ready.' The inquest was told that Mr Allott hoped to raise £8,000 from the sale of the cannabis, and wanted to use the that cash to repay a debt he owed involving a paving business. He gave Ms Reilly £330 towards a payday loan repayment just two days before his body was found on Monday, March 11 at his home on Bevan Place, Rawmarsh, South Yorkshire, the hearing was told. 'He was relying on the cash from the plants to get his life back on track,' she said. 'I just realised how helpless he must have felt.' Another friend Christopher Webb said Mr Allott had been in good spirits when he attended Mr Webb's wedding reception on March 9, and that he had played for Phoenix that afternoon. 'He was a bit merry but not falling all over,' Mr Webb said. 'It was a good night out and we all had a good laugh.' Mr Allott, who lived alone, returned . home in the early hours of Sunday to find his back door had been kicked . in and his house burgled. His friend Anthony O’Donnell found his body on . Monday morning when he did not turn up for a lift to work. Investigating officer Detective . Constable Lisa Yates said the house was clean and tidy except for . cannabis leaves strewn up the stairs. The four mature plants growing in . pots in the loft had been cut off at the roots. 'Stealing cannabis is quite lucrative and we are seeing it more and more,' she said. 'Matthew pinned all his hopes on selling the cannabis as being the answer to his financial problems.' Hearing: Rotherham Coroner's Court was told that Mr Allott had struggled with money problems and that his long-standing debts 'played on his mind' Rotherham coroner Nicola Mundy said Mr Allott was very well-liked, popular and had a large circle of friends. 'He was employed but he did struggle with money problems which was a burden to him,' she said. 'His long-standing debts played on his mind and caused him anxiety.' Recording a verdict of suicide she added: 'I think matters had simply got too much for him.'

The death of Matthew Allott comes at a time of intense criticism of the payday loans industry. Firms have been faced scrutiny for their high  interest levels and . charges, including annual percentage rates (APR) of more than 5,000 per cent. The Debt Advisory Centre has said that 37 per cent of its new clients this year owe money to payday lenders, more than double the 2011 figure of 18 per cent. The centre says this reflects the . 'rapid, highly-publicised, expansion of the payday lending industry' over the last few years, as well as the still increasing popularity of . short-term loans. The Government recently announced plans to cap the cost of payday loans. A cap already exists in Australia where the maximum a lender can . charge is a set-up fee equivalent to 20 per cent of the loan, plus 4 per . cent a month. Labour leader Ed Miliband has also spoken out about firms who plug their expensive services with cartoon-like adverts. However, a spokesman for the Consumer Finance Association, which represents lenders maintained that the adverts were not designed to appeal to children. A study by the Centre for Social Justice, released earlier this . month. found that the market for short-term high-cost credit from . companies such as payday lenders is now worth £4.8 billion a year, it . said. Payday lenders have increased business from £900 million in 2008/09 . to just over £2 billion - around eight million loans - in 2011/12, . according to the CSJ. Around half of payday loan customers reported taking out the money . because it was the only form of credit they could get, the study found.","Matthew Allott hoped to sell the marijuana for £8,000, inquest hears .

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela said doctors had told her that the ailing 95-year-old could recover his voice, although he is still unable to talk. Mr Mandela has been at home since September after spending nearly three months in hospital, and the South African government has described his condition as critical and sometimes unstable. Free: Mr Mandela and his then wife stood hand in hand when he was released from the Victor Vester Prison after 27 years in February 1990 . Ms Madikizela-Mandela told South Africa's Sunday Independent newspaper that while her ex-husband was 'quite ill', he was not being kept alive with a life support machine, as some have speculated. Mr Mandela is suffering from a recurring lung infection. His home in a Johannesburg suburb has been specially adapted so he can receive intensive care. Ms Madikizela-Mandela said the Nobel Peace Prize laureate could not speak 'because of all the tubes that are in his mouth to clear (fluid from) the lungs'. 'He can't actually articulate anything... He communicates with the face, you see,' she said. 'But the doctors have told us they hope to recover his voice. Rumours: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela says doctors have told her her ex-husband could speak again . 'I have heard this nonsense that he is on life support - he is not. 'It is difficult for him. He remains very sensitive to any germs, so he has to be kept literally sterile. The bedroom there is like an ICU ward.' Mr Mandela's family has constantly reassured the public that he is as safe at home as he would be in hospital. Family members and the government have called for Mr Mandela's privacy and dignity to be respected. Mr Mandela became a pivotal figure in South Africa's democracy after his victory in the first multiracial elections in 1994 put an end to the apartheid system. Four years earlier, he was released from 27 years spent in prison under white minority rule, 18 of them at the notorious Robben Island penal colony.

A frank memoir by the granddaughter of Nelson Mandela has revealed she was sexually abused as a child. Zoleka Mandela, 33, also writes about the grief she suffered after losing two children, as well as her battle with breast cancer. Her 13-year-old daughter Zenani was killed in a car crash in June 2010. Two days after celebrating her 13th birthday, the great granddaughter of the former South African president died on her way home from the FIFA World Cup Kick Off Concert in Soweto. Zoleka, who was 10 years old when Nelson Mandela walked free from prison, released her new book of memoirs, When Hope Whispers, today. The honest account also charts her decade-long battle with addiction to drugs and alcohol. An excerpt featured in The Times, reveals: 'From the time I was barely eight years old to the age of 14, I had been sexually abused by some of the adults who should have been looking after me. 'For years I blamed her (her mother Zindzi Mandela) for the physical and sexual abuse I was subjected to as a child,' she said. 'My feeling was that if she had been there for me, she could have prevented it and I could have been protected. I have come to realise she probably did the best she could.' Zoleka'smother Zindzi Mandela grew up while her father was imprisoned on Robben Island and faced watching as her mother Winnie Madikizela Mandela was thrown into jail as well. Each of Zindzi's children had different fathers, with Zoleka recalling her mother could strip and reassemble an AK47 in 38 seconds by the time she was born. Zoleka was told of her eldest child's death while she was recovering in a Johannesburg clinic, a week after she tried to kill herself while on a cocaine binge. The granddaughter of Nelson Mandela tells of the heartache at the death of her 13-year-old daughter in a car crash in June 2010 as well as her decade-long battle with addiction to drugs and alcohol and being diagnosed with breast cancer last year . When Hope Whispers tells that 'the biggest part of her died' when she received the news, adding that she wished God had taken her instead. Zoleka fell pregnant with a baby boy, soon after losing her daughter. But baby Zenawe was born premature and died a few days after birth and was buried a year after his sister in June 2011. From her first boyfriend at the age of nine, her book tells of a series of 'disturbing' relationships, which led her down a path towards addiction - an affliction she battled for a decade.

Sheron Mancini, 53, walked free from the Old Bailey today after claiming she put gold bars in her BRA in a panic . A woman accused of hiding loot from a £1.1 million bullion snatch inside her bra walked free from court today after claiming she had stashed the ingots in a panic. Sheron Mancini, from Roydon, Harlow, was said to have used specially-modified underwear in an attempt to smuggle the precious metals back to the UK from Belgium. But the 53-year-old was cleared of involvement by an Old Bailey jury after insisting she had found the gold bars in her pocket and hidden them down her frontage after panicking when she and lover David Gale, 55, were stopped by police. Her bespoke bra was handed back to her by Belgian authorities and could not be produced as evidence in court. But Gale, along with six others including the stepfather of The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billy Faiers, is facing jail for plotting the snatch. David Chatwood, 57, who shares a house in Brentwood, Essex, with the famous duo, was part of a syndicate who recruited an inside man to steal gold and silver in a fake lorry hi-jacking in Belgium. Chatwood and Gale, along with lorry driver Brian Mulcahy, 46, Stanley Rose, 74, Matthew Middleton, 41, and Garry Cummings, 50, had already admitted their part. John Corley, 52, stood trial alongside Mancini and was convicted. He was remanded in custody ahead of sentence on Friday. Importer-exporters Kyriacos Nicolas, 30, and his father Andreas Nicolas, 50, were said to have been recruited by Corley to help bring the loot back. But they too were cleared after claiming they had rejected his deal after realising the precious metals were suspect. Mancini sighed and held her head in her hands as the verdicts were delivered, while Kyriacos Nicolas and his father cheered and embraced. Convicted: John Corley, 52, (left) stood alongside Mancini (right) at the Old Bailey and faces sentence on Friday . The court heard Mulcahy was found locked inside the trailer of his vehicle at a service station near Wettern in Belgium in October last year. He had been transporting a consignment of 55lbs of gold bullion and 330lbs of silver grain from Vilvoorde, near Brussels, back to the UK. He told officers he had been hijacked at gunpoint and his cargo stolen before he was placed inside his makeshift prison. But prosecutor John Price QC said his account was ‘pure fiction’. He said: ‘Mr Mulcahy had not been the victim of a robbery. ‘No violence or threat or violence was used against him. ‘It hadn’t been necessary for anyone to do so because in this instance the driver of the lorry was one of the thieves.’ The gang plotted their crime over several months, taking trips to the continent and staging regular meetings, not realising they were under surveillance. Most of loot was found on October 13 last year stashed in a room at the de Keyser Hotel and an apartment in Antwerp, both of which had been booked by Stanley Rose. Mancini and Gale had been caught in a VW Passat heading from the hotel back to the UK two days earlier. When Mancini was frisked by Belgian police, two gold ingots weighing more than 12oz - and worth more than £13,000 - tumbled out onto the floor. But she told the court she had gone to Belgium to look at a second hand boat and found the metal in her pockets. She said when the couple were stopped by police she stuffed it between her breasts. ‘I didn’t know what it was. I panicked and put it in my bra,’ said Mancini. ‘I put them down in between my cleavage. It was between my cleavage and not in the cups.’ The jury giggled when, indicating her breasts to the court, she said: ‘Wearing a bra, these are the cups. This forms the cleavage.’ Corley admitted he had attended meetings with co-conspirators, but claimed he did not realise what was being planned. Mancini,  Andreas Nicolas, from Bankes Mead, Duxford, and Kyriacos Nicolas, from Winchmore Hill, north London, denied conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property and were found not guilty. Mancini was earlier cleared of conspiracy to steal before a jury was sworn in after prosecutors offered no evidence. Kyriacos Nicolas was found not guilty of the same charge partway through the trial after the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence against him. Corley, of Biggin Hill, Kent, denied conspiracy to steal and was convicted. Chatwood, from Brentwood, Essex, Mulcahy, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Middleton, of Buckhurst Hill,  Rose, of  Pilgrims Hatch, Brentwood, Gale, of the same Harlow address as Mancini, and Cummings, of Ilford, Essex, have all admitted conspiracy to steal.","Sheron Mancini was accused of using specially-modified underwear .

People dreading the passing of their dog or cat, could find that an unusual marine creature might prove the perfect pet. Scientists claim a certain kind of a freshwater polyp is ‘effectively immortal’ and some other species actually become stronger with age. Hydra magnipapillata, a microscopic animal with a tube-like body comprised of tentacles, a mouth and adhesive foot, may not be a pet that people can cuddle up with, but it is almost completely unaffected by the ageing process. Hydra magnipapillata, a microscopic animal with a tube-like body comprised of tentacles, a mouth and adhesive foot is almost completely unaffected by the ageing process . Hydra . is a genus of small, simple, freshwater animals that possess radial . symmetry. This means that if you cut the creature along several planes, roughly identical pieces would be produced. Hydra . are predatory animals and can be found in most unpolluted freshwater . ponds, lakes, and streams in the temperate and tropical regions. They are multicellular organisms which are usually just a few millimetres long. Biologists . are especially interested in hydra due to their regenerative abilities - they appear not to age or to die of old age. Hydra . have a tubular body up to 10 mm long when extended, secured by a simple . adhesive foot called the basal disc. Gland cells in the basal disc . secrete a sticky fluid that give it  adhesive properties. At the free end of the body is a mouth opening surrounded by one to 12 thin, mobile tentacles. If hydra are alarmed or attacked, the tentacles can be retracted to small . buds and the body column itself can be transformed to a small gelatinous . sphere. Scientists looked at ageing in 46 different species including mammals, plants, fungi and algae. While humans, mammals and birds were found to weaken with age, other organisms such as tortoises and certain trees become stronger. Evolutionary biologist Dr Owen Jones, from the University of Southern Denmark, said: ‘Many people, including scientists, tend to think that ageing is inevitable and occurs in all organisms on Earth as it does for humans; that every species becomes weaker with age and more likely to die. But that is not the case.’ The team studied ageing in species from oak trees and seaweed, roundworms and lice, to lions and baboons. They examined 11 mammals,12 other vertebrates, 10 invertebrates, 12 plants and one algae. ‘The diversity of mortality and fertility patterns in these organisms surprised us and there is clearly a need for more research before we fully understand the evolutionary causes of ageing and become better able to address problems of ageing in humans,’ Dr Jones said. The desert tortoise (pictured) experiences its highest mortality early on in life and is decreasingly likely to die as it ages. It can live for up to 80 years . Ageing in mammals and birds has been studied by scientists in the past, but this study, which was published in the journal Nature, looked at the relatively unexplored area of ageing in other groups of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants algae and fungi. Amazingly there are species that have constant mortality and are unaffected by the ageing process. The . freshwater polyp Hydra magnipapillata has constant low . mortality and in laboratory conditions its risk of dying is so low that . it is effectively immortal. ‘Extrapolation . from laboratory data show that even after 1,400 years five per cent of a . hydra population kept in these conditions would still be alive’, said . Dr Jones. For many species mortality increases with age, a pattern seen in most mammal species including humans and killer whales, but also in invertebrates like water fleas. However, other species buck the trend by experiencing a decrease in mortality as they age. For example, the desert tortoise experiences its highest mortality early on in life and is decreasingly likely to die as it ages and can live for up to 80 years. Many plant species, such as the white mangrove tree, follow the same pattern. There are also species that become more and more fertile with age, including plants such as the agave (pictured), which are found in Mexico and South America . Several species, including rhododendrons, common lizards and hermit crabs, show very little change in mortality throughout their life course. The researchers also looked at fertility patterns of the 46 species and found they varied greatly, while human fertility is characterised by being concentrated in a relatively short period of life. However, there are also species - particularly plants - that become more and more fertile with age, such as the agave, which is found in Mexico and South America. The nematode worm or roundworm starts its life fertile and then suddenly loses the ability to reproduce. The scientists concluded a species can have increasing mortality and still live a long time, or have declining mortality and still live a long time. ‘It makes no sense to consider ageing to be based on how old a species can become,’ said Dr Jones. ‘Instead, it is more interesting to define ageing as being based on the shape of mortality trajectories - whether rates increase, decrease or remain constant with age.’","Biologists from the University of Southern Denmark believe Hydra magnipapillata, is almost completely unaffected by the ageing process .

Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the EU of bullying Ukraine over the failed free trade deal . Russian president Vladimir Putin has accused Europe of bullying Ukraine after the country's politicians bowed to pressure from Moscow and backed out of a trade agreement with the EU. Speaking in St Petersburg today, Putin said the EU had used 'pressure and blackmail' against Ukraine and denied that he had used his influence to block the deal. He said: 'It will become clear in the next few days whether Ukraine and its leadership will yield to pressure or will be able to resist it and take a pragmatic stance in line with national interests.' Protesters waving British and Ukrainian flags took to the streets of Kiev to vent their anger after the government announced it had ended talks with Europe. Ukraine had been expected to sign the landmark  free trade and political association agreement at the Vilinius Summit next week. But negotiations ended after the Ukrainian parliament refused to agree to release the imprisoned former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, one of the terms of the agreement. Tymoshenko, who served as the country's first Prime Minister following the Orange Revolution in late 2004 and early 2005 was jailed in 2011 having been found guilty of abuse of office over a natural gas imports contract with Russia. Speaking from prison today she said she was ready to urge the European Union to drop the demand for her release if that could help persuade the government to sign the agreement. Tymoshenko, whose jailing the West calls politically motivated, also urged Ukrainians to take to the streets to protest the government's decision to shelve the deal and turn to Russia instead. 'She is calling on everybody to come out and express your civic position on the squares of all the cities of the country,' Tymoshenko's lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko said. Following his disputed election victory . in 2004, Ukrainian's Russian-speaking president Viktor Yanukovich was . removed from power by the Supreme Court after one million people took to . the streets. But he was elected president in 2010. Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk, accused Yanukovych of selling out to Moscow in exchange for cash and ensuring his re-election in 2015. 'This is a well-planned scenario by Yanukovych: how to sell the Ukrainian state and to buy himself a seat of the governor of Little Russia as part of the great Russian empire,' he said. Yatsenyuk called on Ukrainians to join an opposition rally Sunday on Kiev's central square, the epicenter of the Orange Revolution which annulled Yanukovych's fraud-tainted victory in a presidential vote and helped bring his pro-Western opponents to power. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, left, was accused of selling out to Moscow  after parliament voted not to agree to the EU's demand to release of jailed former president Yulia Tymoshenko . A smaller protest was already underway there. Several dozen activists wrapped in the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flags hid from rain under umbrellas. 'Europe is our future. In Europe a person is treated with respect,' said Vitaliy Tokaryuk, 25, a real estate agent who had spent the night on the Independence Square. In 2010 presidential elections Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko. The next year, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison on abuse of office charges. Sunday's rally will test the strength of the opposition, and some say that a large showing may nudge Yanukovych back in the direction of the EU. Meanwhile the European Union's enlargement chief  Stefan Fuel said he had 'not fully given up' on Ukraine signing the deal next week, despite Kiev saying it was suspending work on the accord. He said: 'No, we have not fully given up as we were not actually officially informed by the Ukrainian side that the signature is impossible at Vilnius,.' If the deal with Ukraine is not signed next week, he held out hope it could be signed at an EU-Ukraine summit next year. Ukraine's Prime Minister Mykola Azarov sought to defend the decision in parliament Friday, but was booed by opposition lawmakers, who chanted 'Shame!' and threw stacks of papers at his ministers. Azarov said Ukraine cannot afford to lose trade with Russia and suggested the EU did not offer Ukraine any compensation for that. He also complained that the conditions the International Monetary Fund has set for rescuing its struggling economy with a bailout loan were impossible to fulfil. Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russian in the EU: in the first nine months of this year exports to the EU stood at $14.6 billion vs. $21.1 billion to Russia, while imports totaled $22.4 billion from the EU vs. $21.2 billion from Russia, according to Concord Capital, an investment firm in Kiev.","Putin accused the EU of using 'pressure and blackmail' against Ukraine .

To their many fans, Snooki, JWoww and The Situation may be irreplaceable - but MTV believes it has found the perfect group of reality stars to fill the whole they are about to leave in our lives. Jersey Shore is set to air its series finale on December 13, and the network has just announced that its old timeslot will be taken by a new show centring around the wild lifestyles of country folk in West Virginia. The boys and girls of Buckwild are set to bring a new backwoods spirit to MTV on Thursday nights, and will surely hoping to capture the nation's hearts in the same way as the notorious gang of guidos did. Gang: Buckwild showcases a group of young friends living in the tiny town of Sissonville, West Virginia . Antics: The cast members seem to spend much of their time rolling around in mud . Country style: The Buckwild girls are not afraid to join in with traditionally masculine pursuits . It is easy to forget that when Jersey Shore first appeared in 2009, the cast was made up of complete unknowns. So the nine residents of Sissonville, West Virginia featured in Buckwild have every chance of making the leap to national celebrities, like their tanned predecessors. A trailer released by MTV warns viewers to expect lewd behaviour, raging arguments and sometimes incomprehensible Appalachian accents. It opens with one of the girls saying: 'West Virginia is a place founded on freedom - for me and my friends, that means the freedom to do whatever the [bleep] we want.' She adds, 'Our motto round here is: ""Whatever happens, happens.""' Danger: The Appalachian residents seem to be enamoured of stupid and dangerous stunts . Suffering: This cast member rolled down a hill immediately after wolfing down 14 hot wings . Cutting loose: These West Virginians love a good party as much as their New Jersey predecessors . The trailer continues with a montage of reckless stunts involving large explosions, dangerous motorcycles and a bizarre amount of sliding around in mud. The image of rural residents as backwards is promoted by an interview with high school prom king Shane, who says: 'I don't have no phone, Facebook... none of that internet stuff.' And some of the behaviour shown in the trailer seems utterly insane - for example, when one cast member rolls down a hill in a tyre moments after saying, 'I just gone and eaten 14 hot wings.' In many respects, there seems to be little difference between the stars of Buckwild and those of Jersey Shore - the West Virginians are shown fighting with their neighbours and indulging in dubious sexual pursuits. Stereotype: The youths do little to dispel the popular image of country dwellers as rustic people . Fun: The cast members have known each other since childhood and describe themselves as 'family' Old-fashioned: Shane memorably says, 'I don't have no phone, Facebook... none of that internet stuff' One young woman can be seen fighting with her boyfriend, then promptly licking the torso of another cast member to celebrate his birthday. However, the cast of Buckwild are keen to emphasise that they have a gentler side too, as the clip's narrator says: 'We all grew up here together - we're just like family.' And the trailer's final scene supports this, as one of the show's gentlemen toasts the ladies, saying: 'Thanks for dinner, and I hope it tastes as good as y'all look.' Sweet: The friends share a touching moment in between the fights and the swearing . New hit? MTV is hoping Buckwild can replicate the success of Jersey Shore after taking over its timeslot . Besides, while the cast may not seem particularly well educated, they are smarter than they appear - a number of them are college graduates who are simply enjoying the simple life in their home town before starting their careers.

'These . storms typically have tops of thousands of feet, so theoretically . things could be lofted up to that height and carried,' said Benson, a . photojournalist from Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks area. 'I'm sure as . farmers go to work their fields next spring, things will continue to be . recovered unless they're buried beneath topsoil.' Klein . would rather not wait that long, already frayed by the ordeal that . began the Sunday she saw the tornado zeroing in on her home and raced . with her husband and children to a basement safe room.

'There . was that feeling of emptiness, the kind that comes when the kids look . at you with faces of complete fear,' said Klein, 41. A . couple of days later, while holed up in her family's hotel room, she . suddenly remembered the cards her brother gave her. They had been . individually wrapped in plastic and tucked inside the box. The . cards were sealed in neon pink and yellow envelopes. Each was . designated for one of McLaughlin's children - Brendan, Cameron and Erin, . who are now ages 10 to 18. 'My . brother told me, before dying, to give those cards to his kids when the . time is right - their 18th birthday, 21st birthday, the day they got . married,' Klein said.

Even without the cards, . it's unlikely McLaughlin's kids would ever forget their dad, a man who . poured himself into raising funds for children's charities, particularly . those benefiting kids with cancer. McLaughlin, . who worked as a Fidelity Investments software analyst, was a skilled . hockey player and mentored his children in sports. Not long before his . death, McLaughlin got a surprise visit from NHL Hall of Famer and former . Boston Bruins player Ray Bourque at the McLaughlin family's Rockland, . Massachussets, home. Bourque played hockey in the street with McLaughlin's kids as their dad, weakened by cancer, played goalie in a chair. Residents of Washington, a downstate town of 15,000, were left to pick up the pieces and begin recovering from the disaster . The storm killed three people in Massac Country, two in Washington County and one in the city of Washington, in Tazewell County . Bits of American flags and insulation from destroyed houses clung to trees that had been stripped of most of their branches and remaining leaves by the twister . 'I'm . lucky,' Boston Herald columnist Mike Barnicle quoted McLaughlin as . saying in chronicling the day. 'I've had a wonderful life, a beautiful . family, three great kids, my own home.' It . was a bright spot for the family's life, and now Klein wants to find . those cards to ensure that McLaughlin's children have something more . from their father to hold dear. Strangers have joined her search. While . helping with Washington's tornado cleanup, Illinois Wesleyan University . women's golf coach Kathy Niepagen spotted Klein desperately searching . her property, looking for the cards. 'I . felt so bad for this lady. She had such despair in her eyes, and she . didn't care about anything else,' Niepagen recently recalled.

The withered corpse of an elephant cow lies next to the decomposing carcass of her calf in this horrifying image of what could be the worst massacre of wildlife in almost a quarter of a century. Illegal hunters have killed more than 300 elephants, and numerous other safari animals, in Zimbabwe's largest national park by poisoning waterholes with cyanide. The result of the indiscriminate killing has wiped out wildlife in great swathes of the once untouched wilderness of Hwange reserve which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. Devastation: Elephant Cow lies beside the rotting corpses of two calves which had been poisoned by ivory poachers . Conservationists have been particularly concerned by the ruthless use of cyanide by poachers to kill they prey. The animals were struck down when . ‘salt licks’ next to pools where they drink and bathe were contaminated . with the deadly chemical. One hunter told The Telegraph: 'We . couldn't believe our eyes. We thought at first that they must have been . shot. There were too many to have died of thirst or hunger. We found that elephants we saw from the air were not shot, but the tusks were gone.' After the elephants died, often . collapsing just a few yards from the source, lions, hyenas and vultures . which fed on their carcasses were also struck down, as were other . animals such as kudu and buffalo that shared the same waterholes. Horror: This sickening image shows an elephant cow with a calf both of which were poisoned after consuming contaminated water . Elephants . need salt to survive and the hunters cynically knew they would be drawn . to the poison. Dozens of elephants were found in Zimbabwe’s Hwange . National Park with bloody gaps where their tusks had been ripped out. Zimbabwe . is home to some of Africa’s largest elephant herds, with half of its . estimated 80,000 population thought to be in Hwange. The . sprawling 5,657-square mile park is one of the few places in Africa to . have escaped the rapid decline in the continent’s elephant population. Demand for elephants' tusks, which . sell for around £300 each to cross-border traders, is thought to be . encouraging destitute villages to take the drastic action. They . can be resold in South Africa for up to £10,000 a pair, according to . court papers relating one recent incident, sometimes re-emerging as . carved artefacts such as bangles in Cape Town's craft markets. Carnage: Three fresh carcasses lie next to those of two poisoned a year earlier in a horrifying scene repeated across Zimbabwean countryside . The . poisoning was first uncovered by a European hunter and his Zimbabwean . guides who spotted a dead cow and her calf as they flew over the park in . a helicopter. So far, 14 people have been arrested since the first poisoning was discovered. When police arrived at the sites they found the mutilated bodies of elephants strewn around. The . poisonings occurred in July when the national park’s security forces, . which protect herds from the ever-present threat from ivory poachers, . were switched to covering the Zimbabwe general election and its . aftermath. Threatened: More than 300 elephants have been wiped out by poisoning in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. (File photo) Since discovering . the carcasses, police and rangers have searched villages close to the . park and recovered 19 tusks, cyanide and wire snares. Nine alleged poachers were arrested. A South African businessman has also been accused of being behind the poisonings. Police claim that he used a Zimbabwean farmer and an ivory buyer to distribute cyanide to villagers. Saviour . Kasukuwere, Zimbabwe’s environment minister, said the country was . clamping down on ivory poachers as it tries to revive its tourism . industry which has suffered years of decline. ‘We are declaring war on the poachers,’ he said. ‘We are responding with all our might . because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are part . of the natural resources and wealth that we want to benefit the people . of Zimbabwe.’ Mr Kasukuwere . said he would push for stiff penalties for convicted poachers, who . routinely get less than the nine-year jail term imposed for cattle . rustling. A wide range of . other animal carcasses were also found near the contaminated watering . holes, including buffalo, lions, vultures, antelopes and jackals. Demand: Zimbabwe is home to Africa's largest elephant herds - and have proves rich pickings for poachers who can sell tusks hundreds of dollars. (File photo) And last night there were fears that more animals could die in coming weeks as anything that feasted on the elephants’ toxic carcasses could have also become poisoned. A spokesman for the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force said: ‘When other animals and birds feed on the rotting elephant carcasses, they will also die from the poison. Hundreds of animals are now at risk.’ China, which accounts for 40 per cent of the world’s trade in elephant tusks, is said to be one of the main markets for the Zimbabwean ivory, where it has been regarded as a symbol of wealth and status for thousands of years.","Ivory poachers wiped out hundreds of animals in Zimbabwe by poisoning watering holes with cyanide .

Google’s Street View project has mapped the landmarks of Venice, the interiors of train stations and even the Large Hadron Collider. But now anyone can document views of their favourite locations, which might not have been visited by Google’s cameras. Members of the public can use an Android smartphone or camera to take photographs and transform them into 'photo spheres' using ‘Views’, which is a new feature of Google Maps. Here, 'photo spheres' are connected to create a 360º view of Dunluce Castle. Using the new service, photo spheres can be added to Google Maps and shared with people around the world . Users must visit 'Views' and open their profile page. They then manually select the photos they wish to connect to make a sphere of a 360º view. A map of the images is created with photo spheres marked in blue, sequentially with letters. To choose the location of a new photo sphere, users drag a dot to their chosen place and rotate them so landmarks or specific markers are facing in the right direction. Photo spheres can be linked to others so that visitors to the site can jump between similar spheres. The idea is that users connect images together to create photo spheres - 360º views of a chosen location - which can then be added to Google Maps and shared with people around the world. To create a photo sphere, users can take a series of photos using an android smartphone or DSLR camera and upload them to Views. There is no need for a ‘Trekker’ backpack or special car, which are both used by Google in its Street View mapping project.

Some say that in relationships, opposites attract, but new research has found that that might not be the case. According to an analysis of eHarmony's Compatibility Matching System, similarity is actually the key to a long-lasting relationship, even though people with opposite personalities may find themselves attracted to each other at first. The study of thousands of couples looked at patterns that made their relationships successful and found that while opposites attract initially, ultimately they 'attack' each other. Head-to-head: According to an analysis of eHarmony's Compatibility Matching System, similarity is actually the key to a long-lasting relationships, even though opposites may be attracted to each other at first . According to the study, opposites 'only attract for a short time', drawn at first to each other's intriguing an exciting differences. But ultimately, those differences come between them, leading to frustration and animosity. A submissive person might be attracted to someone who is dominant, for instance, but 'it could be better for two highly dominant people to be together,' says the study. 'While they may occasionally clash, they'll do so as equals and ultimately the relationship will be healthier.' 'While two dominants may occasionally clash, they'll do so as equals and ultimately the relationship will be healthier' Similarly, an introverted person may be drawn to an extrovert, because the extrovert's confidence makes the beginning stages of a relationship less stressful for an introvert. Nevertheless, the couple's differing social patterns - like the fact the extroverts thrive in big groups, whereas introverts are content with smaller groups - are likely to eventually cause tension in the relationship. Rather than pair up with someone with an opposite personality, singletons should seek out compatibility if they really want the relationship to endure.",An analysis of eHarmony's Compatibility Matching System found that like personalities are actually key to a long-lasting relationship .

The FBI are hunting the killer responsible for the murder of 21-year-old Lindsay Louise Ellixson, whose badly beaten body was pulled from a bayou in Louisiana following a 'brutal and violent' death. Originally from Orlando, the girl known for her 'big blue eyes' was traveling the country after high school trying to 'figure things out', according to family, when she was found by fishermen about 3pm Saturday in East Baton Rouge. Investigators say she had been in the water for two to five days, with an autopsy revealing she was killed by blunt force trauma to the head, neck and chest. The case has been classed as a homicide. 'She was beaten to death and left there,' Chief of Investigations Shane Evans told WFTV. Victim: Lindsay Louise Ellixson was a long way from home when she was found murdered in east Baton Rouge, La., at the weekend. The 21-year-old from Florida was out 'exploring the world'. Friends say she eschewed alcohol and tobacco due to open heart surgery she had as a child . Scene: The badly-beaten body of Lindsay Louise Ellixson was found in a canal here, at at 8500 South Tiger Bend in East Baton Rouge, La. 'She was a free spirit who loved writing poety': Lindsay's mother Catherine Ellixson, who adopted her daughter aged six, said that even though Lindsay had been traveling alone they kept in regular contact . 'Someone did this to her and put her there.' 'It was unusually brutal and violent.' The victim's adoptive mother, Catherine Ellixson, said that she kept in regular contact with her daughter as she traveled, and that she had been home 'intermittently' over the years, however they had not spoken for at least 10 days before her body was found. 'I knew something wasn't quite right and we were praying for her every day,' Mrs Ellixson said. In what has emerged as possibly the best clues to Linday's murder, the Boone High School graduate posted numerous messages on a social networking site called MeetMe in the two months prior to her death, listing herself as unemployed and homeless. Her name on the site was 'Lindsay Head' and said she was engaged. Strangely she also requested 'ladies only' because she was 'looking for fun for my man'. Clinton Allen Head, 31, of Denham Springs, has given an interview saying he dated Lindsay Ellixson for almost two years. He has been interviewed by detectives investigating the case . That man is believed to be Clinton Allen Head, 31, of Denham Springs, who told The Advocate he dated Ellixson for nearly two years. Head, who can be seen in some of Ellixson's Facebook photos, said he first met her when she moved to Louisianna with a boyfriend. He denied the pair were engaged. 'We loved each other but never technically got engaged,' he said. Head said he was interviewed by detectives and said he was confident they would crack the case. He described Ellixson as 'awesome' and having 'the best personality'. 'I just can't imagine anything she could have possibly done or said (to provoke an attack)' he said. Ladies only: On Lindsay Ellixson's dating profile on website MeetMe.com she had listed herself as gay but said she was engaged and 'looking for fun for my man' In the months before her death Ellixson wrote on MeetMe: 'Anyone in Denham willing to help me with a place to stay. I NEED A PLACE TO STAY BY SUNDAY NIGHT!!! Anywhere would be nice. 'Everyone tells me it’s gonna get better but no one actually wants to help,' she wrote on MeetMe. Revealingly, Ellixson also appealed for a ride from Plaquemine to Denham Springs. Her body was found in Baton Rouge, which is between the two destinations. 'I can’t find a good guy to spoil me and love me for me…why does it always have to end up about sex!' she wrote. 'I’m making it known that I’m in need of someone sexy to take care of me and make my life less boring…I need more excitement!!!” Clue: According to social media posts put online before her death, Lindsay Ellixson was asking for a ride from Plaquemine to Denham Springs, which is a journey of about an hour. However her body would be found in a bayou just off the road in Baton Rouge, about halfway between the two points . 'HATE MY LIFE,' Ellixson posted. Her last MeetMe entry read: 'GIVING UP FOR NOW.' According to her mother Catherine, Lindsay wasn't sure what to do after finishing high school in 2011, where she was part of the swim team and loved to write poetry. Lindsay decided to venture out on her own to explore the world. 'She had beautiful blue eyes and a free spirit,' Mrs Ellixson told The Advocate. 'She just had a lot of struggles that she needed to overcome.' Lindsay was one of three kids who are all adopted. Her father, Chris Ellixson, said the family are coming to terms with her death. 'She's looking down on us, smiling, wishing us a happy Thanksgiving,' he told WAFB. 'We know where she is.' Family photo: Lindsay Ellixson is pictured here with her two brothers, Sean and Brendan Ellixson. All three children were adopted . Homicide detectives discovered Lindsay Ellixson's body in a canalwith blunt force trauma to her head, neck and chest. A search for her killer is underway . '(She was) just trying to figure things out.' Mrs Ellixson said that after their last conversation on November 3 she started making arrangements for Lindsay's return. 'It seemed as if she was ready to come home,' Mrs Ellixson said. Ellixson's funeral will be held this week, according to her obituary. Anyone with information about Ellixson is asked to contact the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office at 225-389-5000, or CrimeStoppers anonymously at 344-STOP.","The body of Lindsay Louise Ellixson, 21, was found in a canal in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday by fishermen .

David Karp, the 26-year-old who has just sold his fantastically popular blogging site Tumblr to Yahoo! for a $1.1billion cash deal, made the announcement today and signed off with a resounding 'F*** yeah'. Karp, a high school drop-out who started the site from his mother's New York apartment in 2007, posted a message on Tumblr's staff blog on Monday. He told users that he was 'elated' to be joining Yahoo! and echoed the words of the company's CEO Marissa Mayer by saying: 'We won’t let you down.' Scroll down for video, full statement and gif . F*** yeah! David Karp, who founded Tumblr in 2007 in his mother's Manhattan apartment, just sold the site to Yahoo for $1.1billion . Success story: David Karp dropped out of high school but founded Tumblr, a wildly popular micro-blogging site which has turned him into a multimillionaire . He wrote that Tumblr's vision 'to empower' users had not changed but that he was excited to have the help of Mayer and the Yahoo! team. In closing, Karp wrote: 'As always, everything that Tumblr is, we owe to this unbelievable community. We won't let you down.' Although David Karp is now exceedingly wealthy following the Yahoo! buyout of his start-up Tumblr, the $1.1billion cash deal still leaves the 26-year-old short of the world's youngest billionaires - some of whom have yet to see their 30th birthdays: . The casual 'F*** yeah', a somewhat brash sign-off to a billion-dollar deal, is reminiscent of another tech tycoon's attitude to the world of multinational corporations. Mark Zuckerberg once touted Facebook business cards with the words 'I'm CEO, B****' emblazoned on the front. Karp's announcement came after Yahoo!'s board of directors agreed on Sunday to buy the wildly popular blogging platform Tumblr, which boasts 100million users and 90million posts per day, for $1.1billion cash. The deal makes the native New Yorker the latest 20-something tech tycoon, even though he was publicly opposed even last year, to selling the company which he founded in his mother's small Manhattan apartment in 2007. However, Karp - a high school dropout . who taught himself how to code - had expressed grave reservations about . giving up his brainchild to a Silicon Valley tech giant. In a 2012 interview with the Guardian, he said he had been swatting away buy-out requests for years. 'Particularly . in the first three years, there were a lot of (mergers and . acquisitions) people who would pull you aside and you'd think ""Well, . s***, I could be a pretty rich 23-year-old with very little effort,""' he . said. 'We stuck it out. I won't say I really knew why.' Moving on up: Karp lives with his girlfriend Rachel Eakley, a graduate student and chef, in a modest apartment in Manhattan's West Village . Big deal: The $1.1billion takeover of Tumblr is Marissa Mayer's major move since she took over as Yahoo CEO in July. Observers say she is using the deal to set the tone of her tenure at the company . Perhaps the perseverance makes sense to Karp now that he is 'very rich' at age 26. The deal conjures images of another young man who is very rich - Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Legendary: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's former business card also to a flippant approach . At $1.1billion, Tumblr's worth is . nowhere near the value of $100billion Facebook, but 29-year-old . Zuckerberg's success has become something of a pattern for young, . brilliant tech entrepreneurs. It is unclear how large a stake in the company Karp maintained before the Yahoo deal. In 2008, he sold a 25 per cent stake to investors for $750,000. The investor share of the company was $125million at the time of the deal, according to AllThingsD. Karp grew up on Manhattan's . Upper West Side, the son of a music composer father who wrote songs for . films and TV shows and a mother who was a teacher. He taught himself how to code HTML at . age 11 and began setting up his own consulting business shortly . thereafter. His parents allowed him to drop out of high school at age 15 . and complete the remainder of his education by home-schooling. At age 17, he moved to Japan, where he cemented his skill as a programmer and began pitching his ideas to tech companies. He . moved back to New York and sold his services as a consultant. He . founded Tumblr in 2007 at age 21 - and it quickly consumed all of his . time. He started up an . office in Manhattan and has ardently resisted the lure of moving to . Silicon Valley. He also tried to resist the money that the tech world . had to offer. He told the Guardian that he wanted to remain independent - believing he could grow the company by growing ad revenue naturally. Within a year, though, he was accepting funds from venture capital investors. He currently lives with his girlfriend Rachel Eakley in a modest apartment in Manhattan's West Village. Miss Eakley is a chef and a graduate student studying psychology. Miss Eakley has been Karp's constant companion at public events for several years . On Monday morning, Yahoo! CEO Marissa . Mayer publicly announced the purchase of Tumblr with a post on her own . Tumblr page - including an animated GIF image that acknowledged the . public questions about the acquisition. Her first words about the deal were: 'We promise not to screw it up.' Mayer announced that Karp will stay on as CEO of Tumblr and continue to run and develop the site. Despite a massive user base, Tumblr's . revenue was only $13million last year. Even that figure was only made . possible after $125million in capital investments. The . deal also faced almost immediate backlash from Tumblr users, who feared . Yahoo!'s ownership would change the character of the site and water down . the features that make it successful. Mayer . sought to allay concerns on both sides - and even used an internet meme . to make light of the criticism. The GIF she posted reads: 'Yahoo. Tumblr. Now Panic and Freak Out.' Instead, . Mayer urged users and Yahoo! investors alike the 'Keep Calm and Carry . On' - a reference to a famous British propaganda poster produced during . World War II. Tech news site AllThingsD . reports that Mayer, who took over as Yahoo! CEO in July, wanted to . quickly snatch up Tumbler as 'the stake in the ground of what her . strategy is going forward for Yahoo.' Tumblr, which is a mico-blogging platform for quickly posting pictures, text and video, also functions as a social media site. Its platform manages to blend elements of all of the major social networking sites. Sharing and posting photos is simple and easy, like Instagram. GIFs and videos are all easy to share, as well. But, the site also has a new feed function, allowing users to follow other Tumblr blogs like social media networks Facebook and Twitter. Very young and very rich: Karp and Eakley, who enjoy spending their Sunday mornings at brunch in Manhattan's East Village, are now due for a major lifestyle change . The simple layout of Tumblr has . spawned millions of diverse, quirky, blogs. An enormously popular Tumblr . called '#whatshouldwecallme' features a series of animated GIFs . explaining the reactions to daily life of a 20-something woman. However, . celebrities like Joe Jonas and Lady GaGa also have popular Tumblr pages . and companies like the shoemaker Cole Haan use the site as a creative . way to market their products. Within hours of the $1.1billion buyout of microblogging site Tumblr by Yahoo!, the backlash had already began online. Much of the vitriol was directed at CEO Marissa Mayer's attempt to make Yahoo! cool again. @kelsiemonster tweeted: 'Yahoo! wants to sit at the cool kids' table. So it bought Tumblr.' @wongopher said: 'Yahoo buying Tumblr is like a 14 year-old's uncool dad trying to make his own selfie a meme.' WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg wrote on his blog on Sunday that since the Yahoo!/Tumblr news began doing the rounds that 72,000 posts had been imported to WordPress from Tumblr in one hour. The usual rate is around 400 an hour. Tumblr is also popular with many porn stars and features numerous sexually-explicit blogs. Tumblr boasts remarkable loyalty among its users. Some 85percent of Tumblr users make 20 or more posts a month. Mayer . cited some of these facts when addressing critics who worried Yahoo was . paying too much for a company that has yet to turn a profit. In . her Tumblr post, she wrote: 'The combination of Tumblr+Yahoo! could . grow Yahoo!’s audience by 50% to more than a billion monthly visitors, . and could grow traffic by approximately 20%. 'In . terms of working together, Tumblr can deploy Yahoo!’s personalization . technology and search infrastructure to help its users discover . creators, bloggers, and content they’ll love.' She . also addressed the fears of Tumblr users, who threatened to leave the . service in droves or to otherwise protest the takeover. 'Tumblr . is incredibly special and has a great thing going.  We will operate . Tumblr independently.  David Karp will remain CEO,' Mayer wrote. 'The . product roadmap, their team, their wit and irreverence will all remain . the same as will their mission to empower creators to make their best . work and get it in front of the audience they deserve. Yahoo! will help . Tumblr get even better, faster.' Unlike the famously-dressed-down Mark Zuckerberg, Karp prefers wearing plaid instead of a hoody. But he's not afraid to wear a suit, either.","David Karp founded Tumblr in his mother's Manhattan apartment in 2007 .

WestJet Airlines will make its first trans-Atlantic flight next summer, offering daily, non-stop flights to Dublin . Introductory fares mean WestJet's passengers flying from St. John's to Dublin would pay approximately £230 for a return flight, while tickets from Toronto to Dublin would cost around £360. This could be the beginning the first stage of a longer-term plan to extend service over the Atlantic, Raymond James analyst Ben Cherniavsky wrote in a research note. The move could compete with Europe's biggest no-frills airline, Ryanair - who have dismissed any suggestion that they would begin flights to Canada, The Independent reported. Chris Avery, WestJet Vice-President, Network Planning, Alliances and Corporate Development said they wanted to bring discounted prices to their customers so that they can explore Europe. He said: 'It is an exciting time for WestJet as we bring our unique brand of low fares and award-winning guest experience to a whole new market. The no-frills deal is similar to that of Ryanair's approach, which has become Europe's biggest budget carrier .

'From Dublin, guests can access low-cost flights to more than 100 cities in Europe.' WestJet's first transatlantic route will cut the current travel time from St. John's to Dublin by nearly half. It boasted that: 'in just about the same time it takes to fly from Toronto to Calgary, guests are able to experience ancient castles, cobblestone roads, and the Cliffs of Moher.' It comes after budget carrier Norwegian announced plans to offer cheap tickets on long-haul services.

Just 20 years ago, Sudanese women as young as 11 or 12 would routinely be fattened up before their weddings - in part to make them seem older, but largely because being fat is seen as a symbol of wealth and status. And, let us not forget, because a well-fed bride is likely to attract a better dowry. Weight loss is fast becoming a priority for women with thousands joining gyms, but in such a conservative country as Sudan, a scene like this would have been unthinkable until a few years ago . In some parts of Sudan it is reported that fathers would cut a hole in their daughter's bed and leave her there for a year, feeding her fat-laden food and drink until she became big enough to fill the hole. Only then would she be considered large - and valuable - enough to be married off. But, inspired by stars such as Rihanna and Beyonce who invade their television screens and the magazines that are ever more available, modern Sudanese girls are fighting back against their fat-loving culture in an attempt to emulate their slender idols. related] . Female-only gyms have opened all over the country and are attracting women in their thousands who are keen to lose weight and get fit - a concept that would have been unthinkable in the conservative country up until a few years ago. It is not only their figures that concern them either, rather the growing awareness of obesity-related illnesses and the complications that can lead from being drastically overweight. Speaking to BBC World, fitness trainer Amal Ahmed said: 'In Sudan, fat has become not wanted. Sudanese want to be like the people outside. Sudanese men much preferred the fuller figured look and fathers would even go as far as feeding their daughter fat-laded food and drink until she became big enough to be married off . Nafisa Bedri, a professor at Afhad University for Women who has researched obesity and body image in Sudan, told them: 'The media has created this image among . young women that they have to be very thin - they want to be skinny like . the models they see in magazines and on satellite television. 'Just as in the West, it's now very . common for women to lose weight - rather than gain it - in time for . their wedding day.' There has also been the introduction of a . new term - 'style' - into popular lexicon, essentially meaning a slim . and pretty woman, which is a look so many of the modern Sudanese girls . want to embody. Thanks to the influences of super slender stars like Beyonce and Rihanna, Sudanese girls are desperate to emulate their slim idols . This age old tradition, dating back centuries and coming to an end - as a widespread tradition, at least - is seen as the training women receive before getting married. It is deemed to prepare them for marriage and womanhood. During this period the girl isn't allowed to come into contact with any human other than an older woman who is in charge of caring for her. Inside the room, the girl is massaged three times a day, fed six huge meals daily, drinks three pints of water three times each day and sleeps for hours on end. The girl is also given domestic training of home management such as cooking, childcare and housekeeping and is also taught how to make her husband happy. After reaching her optimum weight and leaving the fattening room, the girl is fed garri, a porridge made from cassava tubers, and native salads, by her husband. Her diet is also full of foods such as rice, beans, more meat and fish. At the end of the period, a graduation ceremony takes place to celebrate her success.","Girls as young as 11 or 12 were once fattened up before their weddings .

A teenager was charged last night with murdering a blind man who was found stabbed to death at a house party. Jordan Flattery, 19, was accused of killing Graham Snowden, by detectives from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit. The 36-year-old victim died in hospital from a stab wound to the chest after an incident at a property in Milestone Road, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in the early hours of Sunday. A 15-year-old boy arrested in connection with the inquiry on Sunday was freed on police bail to return to Stevenage police station on a date in February. Flattery, of West Close, Hitchin, will appear before magistrates in Hatfield today. Neighbours reported hearing 'banging . and screaming' shortly before the incident. Paramedics rushed Mr Snowden . to hospital, but doctors could not save his life. Officers arrested a teenager and cordoned off a house in Milestone Road after the incident at about 2am last night. Today Detective Inspector Tim Redfearn . from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'We are . still very much in the early stages of this investigation and would . appeal to anyone who may have information in connection with this . incident to come forward.' A post-mortem examination was carried out today, which established the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest. Mr Snowden had two young daughters. He . was left partially blind and has to walk with a stick following a road . accident a few years ago. A family liaison officer was said to . be comforting his family at their home. Police said the arrested boy and . Mr Snowden were not related, but wouldn't be drawn on if they knew each . other. The youth will return to answer bail at Stevenage police station on February 17 . Police were called to the house in the early hours of Sunday morning following reports of a man being stabbed. 'There was some sort of ruckus going . on and a punch up,' a neighbours said. 'Then it all went quiet and a . short while later the police turned up.' By the time officers arrived an . ambulance crew was already at the scene. Mr Snowden was taken to the . Lister Hospital in Stevenage, where he later died. Police cordoned off the house in . Milestone Road, which belongs to an unnamed single mother, as a forensic . investigation got underway. Another house in nearby Westmill Road was . also sealed off. Herts & Beds Major Crime Unit have launched a murder investigation. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Collin said: 'Firstly, my thoughts are with the man's family at this distressing time. Tributes have been left at the scene while police continue to investigate Mr Snowden's death . 'Whilst an arrest has been made, I would l still like to appeal for witnesses in connection with this incident. If you were in the area at the time and have information about what happened, I would urge you to make contact with police as soon as possible.' A post-mortem examination has established that the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest. Neighbours said the dead man lived in the nearby village of Stondon. One said: 'He was known as Snowy and he had two young daughters, although the relationship with the children's mother was over.' She added: 'Some years ago he was involved in a nasty car accident on the A505 in North Herts and, as a result, he was left partially sighted and he walked with the aid of a stick.' Graham Snowden was killed after a row at a party on Milestone Road, in Hitchin . Another neighbour, Steve Dilley, told local reporters: 'I got a knock at about four in the morning, from police. I was in bed when it happened, and the bedrooms are at the back, so I didn’t hear much. 'Obviously, we are all shocked. You don’t expect it to happen on your doorstep, in your own street. It’s a fairly quiet street normally.' Steve Williamson, another resident, added: 'I was very shocked. It brings it all home. There’s never normally any trouble on this street, it makes you think whether you are safe walking about at night.' One neighbour, who asked to remain anonymous, was awake when the incident happened: 'I heard some noise, then it all went quiet. 'Then the police turned up. There were seven police cars, an ambulance and a dog unit, nine in total.'

The Duchess of Cambridge reportedly broke down in tears when she was told of Mr Mandela's passing. The Duchess, who was sitting next to William during Thursday evening’s screening of Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, was said to be ‘very moved’ when she was told 15 minutes before the end  of the movie. And she left the cinema in tears, according to the film’s executive producer Harvey Weinstein. ‘Kate was very emotional, she was in tears and very moved by the events. We all were,’ he said. ‘There is nothing to describe the momentousness of what happened. The Duke and Duchess handled themselves very elegantly.’ But William was also struggling to contain his emotions, Mr Weinstein said. The Duchess managed to give her somber black outfit a glamorous edge, with small polka dot print and perfectly styled hair . William also looked smart in a dark blue suit and burgundy tie .

William was . deeply touched by the news, you could see it in his face, but he was . being very courageous.’ Mr . Weinstein said that it was poignant that William and Kate, who share a . passion for Africa and were engaged to be married in Kenya, were . representing the Royal Family. Arriving for the premiere, the Duchess had walked the red carpet in a floor-length white Roland Mouret dress. She . and Prince William had smiled for the cameras as they met the stars of . the show and Mr Mandela’s daughters Zindzi and Zenani, who had flown to . London from South Africa for the premiere. At 6.50pm UK time, minutes . before the gala screening was due to start at the Odeon Leicester . Square,  Mr Mandela died in South Africa. A . Royal protection officer is understood to have told Rebecca Deacon, the . Duchess’s private secretary,  who was also sitting next to her, that Mr . Mandela had died. Miss Deacon then informed the Duke  and Duchess. William . and Kate told their aides that they wanted to see the movie to the end . and they remained in their seats until the credits rolled. ‘Zindzi . and Zenani left as soon as they heard the news, but they did not want . to stop the screening,’ Mr Weinstein said. ‘William and Kate said they . wanted to watch the movie and stayed until the end. We all did. It . seemed the right thing to do.’ Moving: Prince William paid tribute to Nelson Mandela alongside the Duchess of Cambridge following last night's film premiere of Mandela: The Long Walk to Freedom, where the couple were told after they saw it . The Duke and Duchess were sitting a few seats away from the British actor Idris Elba, who plays Mr Mandela, and Naomie Harris, who plays the leader’s ex-wife Winnie. As the credits started rolling, the audience rose for a standing ovation. At this point the Royal couple were escorted out of  the upper circle and downstairs into the foyer by their  security team. In the auditorium the invited audience were cheering and clapping, most unaware that Mr Mandela had died. Then an emotional  Mr Elba, film director Justin Chadwick and the producer Anant Singh came down from the upper  circle to address  the audience. ‘President Zuma has announced the passing of Madiba,’ Mr Singh told a now silent audience. ‘President Zuma said Madiba had departed and was at peace. Our nation has lost its greatest son.’ Tears: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visibly upset when they left the premiere of Mandela: A Long Walk To Freedom . As the credits continued to roll, Mr Singh asked for a minute’s silence. Many of the guests, who were dressed in black tie for a planned after-party, were in tears. Many were still crying as they spilled into the chilly foyer. The film-makers agreed to cancel the after-party as a mark of respect to Mr Mandela. The movie is due to be released in the UK on January 3.  It has already broken box office records  in South Africa.","Royal couple were at the house in Trafalgar square to sign condolence book .

Chicago has a well-earned reputation for brutally cold winters, but Monday night set a new record as temperatures plunged and the Windy City experienced its coldest December night in 18 years. Players as well as spectators had to suffer the bone-chilling conditions, but while pitch side they used heaters to thaw out their Gatorade buckets, fans in the stands weren’t so lucky. Football fans, such as Ruby, right,  who braved the bitterly cold weather to attend Monday night’s football game between the Chicago Bears and the Dallas Cowboys had more to content with than just the frigid conditions when their beer started to freeze . Players as well as spectators had to suffer the bone-chilling conditions, but while pitch side they used heaters to thaw out their Gatorade buckets, fans in the stands weren¿t so lucky . Several bear-drinkers posted photos on social media sites of their frozen beverages, including one person whose drink had so completely turned to ice that they could turn their cup upside down and not spill any. Bears fans could at least enjoy the result, a convincing 45:28 win which puts them right back in the playoff race, but spare a thought for the poor Cowboy’s fans who sat through what is officially the coldest regular-season game in teams' history. Of course the coldest game in franchise history is the Ice Bowl, the 1967 NFL Championship when it was minus-13 at kickoff and the Cowboys lost to the Green Bay Packers 21-17 at Lambeau Field. The official game-time temperature on Monday was a frigid eight degrees and wind chill conditions made it feel below zero, but it doesn’t come close to the coldest days ever in Chicago.

A woman accused of stabbing to death her boyfriend with a stiletto heel has been released on $100,000 bond, causing a witness in the case to fear a similar fate. Ana Trujillo, 44, was freed from the Harris County Jail in Texas Wednesday. She is charged with stabbing her 59-year-old boyfriend, University of Houston professor Alf Stefan Anderson, as many as 30 times with the heel of her stiletto in June at his apartment. Now, Jim Carroll, who is set to testify in her upcoming trial, is frightened for his life. Couple's fight: Trujillo, left, and her boyfriend, Andersson, right, got into a fight after leaving a favorite taco shop . Self-defense: Trujillo was released Wednesday on $100,000. She claims she acted in self-defense . 'She told me on two different . occasions, that if anybody ever screwed with her that they were going to . get this in the eye and it was a stiletto heel,' Carroll told KHOU 11. He . said he met Trujillo when she was renting an apartment at a complex he . was managing. Ever since she was arrested, he's been watching his back, . he explained. She has . been in custody for six months, and Carroll said he has spent that time . constantly checking websites to see if she'd been released. 'It's . crazy, why would they let somebody out on bond that just murdered a guy . hitting him 31 times in the face with an object?' he said. Scared: Carroll, who is set to testify in her upcoming trial, is frightened for his life now she's free on bail . Carroll told KHOU 11 that he's not afraid to testify, but he is worried she may try to find him before she goes trial. Trujillo's . attorney, Jack Carroll, no relation, said his client is scheduled to be . in court Friday morning to discuss conditions of her bond. 'I . expect self-defense may be a major issue in this case,' he said, adding . that there may be evidence that Trujillo was involved in an abusive . relationship with Andersson. Trujillo admitted in June that she killed Andersson in a lover's spat at their apartment. Trujillo . and Andersson had spent most of the evening at Bodegas, a local taco . shop, where they drank a couple bottles of wine and took a few tequila . shots. Heavy drinking: The couple had a few bottles of wine and progressed to tequila shots before they got into an argument and left this local Houston taco shop . Walter Garcia, an assistant manager . at the restaurant saw the couple there often. Andersson often came by . himself, but would bring along his girlfriend on Fridays or special . occasions. 'I knew him. He was a good person,' Garcia told the AP. 'They looked like a normal couple.' But things turned sour that night . when another man approached Trujillo at the bar and offered to buy her a . drink. Andersson got jealous of the stranger's advances which spurned a . fight back at his apartment around 2 a.m. The ensuing fight was so loud, that neighbors thought it sounded like furniture moving. When Andersson grabbed her, Trujillo . told police that she pulled his hair - so much so that she had clumps of . it in her hands. When that didn't stop him she started beating him with a . stiletto shoe causing multiple stab wounds. 'Killer' heels: Ana Trujillo used the heel of her stiletto to fight off her allegedly violent boyfriend . Crime scene: Authorities say Ana Trujillo stabbed her boyfriend, Alf Stefan Andersson, to death with a stiletto heel at this condo complex in June . Police arrived at 3:44 a.m., but who called the authorities is still unclear. When . police got to the 18th floor of the condo, Trujillo opened the door and . let officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a . hallway between the entryway and the kitchen. While . Trujillo claims she acted in self-defense, that doesn't change the . charges, according to Sara Marie Kinney, a spokesman for the Harris . County District Attorney's office. 'She confessed to doing it. The reason and all of that will play out in court,' Kinney said. Andersson's friends at Bodegas said they were sad to lose a regular and a friend. 'Everybody, now, we're very sad, angry with her, because he was customer No. 1,' Garcia said. The bar hosted a memorial for Andersson after his death where they gave out free Bud Light and Jiro Tequila - his favorite drinks.","Ana Trujillo, 44, was freed from the Harris County Jail in Texas Wednesday .

For Apple is believed to be launching an iPad Mini next month, and now fansite Apple.pro claims to have photographed the eight-inch evolution of the iPad. Apple is notoriously secretive on the run-up to new launches, but leaks from within the industry, including from suppliers and partners, have all but confirmed the device is on its way this Autumn. Almost ready for prime time? Website Apple.Pro revealed these images of the alleged eight-inch iPad Mini, due to launch on October 17 . The Apple Mini is believed to sport an eight-inch screen, making it a shrunken version of the iPad's ten-inches. This will allow a higher degree of portability over previous models, and also give Apple the ammunition to compete with Google, which recently brought out a seven-inch range of Nexus tablets. Apple.Pro also reports this is a 3G-capable model, meaning you can use data on the go. While Steve Jobs was famously against smaller iPads, the success of the Nexus and Amazon's 'Fire' of budget tablets appears to have convinced Apple there is a market for the slim-line device. Rumours from Apple suppliers suggest the innards of the Mini will be equivalent to an iPad 2, which analysts suggest will be more than enough to power the shrunken device. The third iPad had a specification increase but also increased slightly in weight due to the demands of the high-definition Retina display. Front and back: Alleged sightings of the iPad Mini suggest it retains the simple, minimalist style of previous models . According to these images, the iPad Mini comes with dual speakers on the rim, as well as the newly-designed dock connector . Apple is also believed to be announcing the iPhone 5 during September, although it has not yet confirmed a launch date. The . new device which is expected to boast a display of less than eight . inches will be unveiled at a separate event, so as not to dilute the . impact of the iPhone's launch, according to analysts. 'I donâ€™t think Apple would want reviews of both a new iPhone and new-size iPad appearing at the same time,' said Daring Fireball's John Gruber. 'Why share the spotlight? Why have another Apple product battling with the iPhone for the top spots in news coverage? 'The . more I think about it, the less sense it makes for the iPhone to even . share the stage at the announcement with any other product.

New love: Anna Ziuzina is now in a relationship with British company director Ivan Lister and pregnant . An internet bride whose millionaire husband was brutally murdered in the Ukraine is pregnant and in a relationship with another British businessman. Former lap-dancer Anna Ziuzina, 34, has become romantically involved with a company director called Ivan Lister. She has been staying in a flat the father-of-two recently bought for £295,000, just a few miles from his £2million home in north London. The fashion-conscious ex-stripper – who is involved in a bitter dispute with her late husband’s family over his £1.5million estate - is driving a one-year-old, £20,000 Mini Cooper Countryman. Prior to being asked about her relationship with Mr Lister, Miss Ziuzina told the Mail her life had been a ‘nightmare’ since her husband Barry Pring died. But smartly dressed, she looked relaxed and happy in the company of her new man, who is listed at Companies House as being a director of Ochre Blue Ltd, a women's handbag and accessories firm. He is believed to have a professional interest in casinos and gambling, own a number of properties and drives an £80,000 Range Rover Sport. Details of how Miss Ziuzina has formed a relationship with Bradford-born Mr Lister, 44, emerged as David Cameron dramatically intervened in the bungled investigation into the murder of her Mr Pring. The British PM has written to his Ukrainian counterpart, demanding ‘all necessary steps’ are taken to prosecute those behind his death. The development comes nearly two years after a Daily Mail investigation revealed the highly suspicious chain of events leading up to the death of Mr Pring, 47, who was run over in Kiev on the night he celebrated his first wedding anniversary with Miss Ziuzina. We also exposed the Ukrainian authorities’ shambolic handling of the case, which has been mired in allegations of a cover-up involving corrupt police. It is believed the local Mafia may have been involved in the plot to kill Mr Pring. Romance: Miss Ziuzina with her new boyfriend Ivan Lister. He is believed to have a professional interest in casinos and gambling, own a number of properties and drives an £80,000 Range Rover Sport . Mr Pring, originally from Devon, was struck by a car travelling at 80 mph as he waited for a cab on the hard shoulder of a deserted dual-carriageway on the outskirts of Kiev in February 2008. The vehicle’s lights were switched off at the time of impact and debris found at the scene included false number plates and a bogus taxi sign. Miss Ziuzina had been at his side a few minutes earlier but was standing with her back to the road when her husband was killed. Although she never lived in Britain during their marriage and since his death has advertised herself as a ‘model’ in Miami, she was initially granted legal aid to fund her claim for a huge inheritance. But she is no longer in receipt of public funds. At the time of our initial revelations in June 2011, the case was being treated as an unexplained ‘traffic accident’.

Prime Minister highlighted the case to the Ukrainian Prime Minister and . …. asked for the Ukrainian Prime Minister's assistance instructing the . relevant authorities to take all necessary steps to bring their . investigations to a conclusion and prosecute those responsible.’ The Ukrainian Police have now asked Devon and Cornwall Police for the initial statements made to them by Mr Pring’s family and friends, details of incoming and outgoing phone calls at his south-west London home, information on his finances and emails he sent and received in the years before his death. Mr Pring owned a string of properties, drove two cars including a Lotus and ran an IT consultancy. Prior to meeting Mr Pring, Miss Ziuzina worked at gentlemen’s clubs in Ukraine and Luxembourg. But when she advertised for a husband on an international dating website, Mr Pring understood she was an English teacher. When he found out several weeks into their relationship in 2006 that she worked in strip clubs, he persuaded her to give it up and set her up in a flat, paid her a living allowance and bought her a car. They married in Kiev in January 2007 but had a long-distance relationship and only lived together for several weeks before his tragic death 13 months later.

'I want people to understand that this man did not randomly walk into a hospital to commit this crime,' Lieutenant Paul Vernon said.

She had been shot with the gun found at the nursing home, a sheriff's statement said. It wasn't immediately clear if Mr Anderson had a lawyer who could comment on the case. Mr Anderson was 'the sweetest guy you could ever imagine,' neighbor Grace Madrigal said, holding back tears.

A South African sign language interpreter accused of making up his own signs during a memorial to Nelson Mandela has revealed he may have suffered a schizophrenic episode on stage after claiming he saw 'angels' at the event. Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, who has been violent in the past and suffers from schizophrenia, said that his hallucinations began while he was interpreting and that he tried not to panic because there were 'armed policemen around me.' He added that he was once hospitalized in a mental health facility for more than one year. Scroll down for video . Claims: Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, a South African sign language interpreter accused of making up his own signs during a memorial to Nelson Mandela has claimed he saw 'angels' at the event . The sign language interpreter at Nelson Mandela's memorial accused of being 'a fake' has said he may have suffered a schizophrenic episode on stage . Mr Jantjie, who stood gesticulating . near President Obama and others who spoke at Tuesday's ceremony that was . broadcast around the world, insisted that he was doing proper . sign-language interpretation of the speeches of world leaders. He said he worked for a company called SA Interpreters which had . been hired by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) for Tuesday's ceremony at Johannesburg's . 95,000-seat Soccer City stadium. He said he was paid 85 dollars (£52) for interpreting the event. But he also apologized for his performance that has been dismissed by many sign-language experts as gibberish. Mr Jantjie gesticulates at his home during an interview in Johannesburg, South Africa . 'I would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said in his concrete home in a low-income Johannesburg neighborhood . When Mr Jantjie was shown video footage of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service he said 'I don't remember any of this at all' 'I . would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, . forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said in his concrete home in a low-income . Johannesburg neighborhood . 'But what I was doing, I was doing what I believe is my calling, I was doing what I believe makes a difference.' 'What . happened that day, I see angels come to the stadium ... I start . realizing that the problem is here. And the problem, I don't know the . attack of this problem, how will it comes. Sometimes I react violent on . that place. Sometimes I will see things that chase me,' Mr Jantjie said. 'I was in a very . difficult position,' he added. 'And remember those people, the president . and everyone, they were armed, there was armed police around me. If I . start panicking I'll start being a problem. I have to deal with this in a . manner so that I mustn't embarrass my country.' Asked how often he had become violent, he said 'a lot' while declining to provide details. Mr Jantjie . said he was due on the day of the ceremony to get a regular six-month . mental health checkup to determine whether the medication he takes was . working, whether it needed to be changed or whether he needed to be kept . at a mental health facility for treatment. Claims: Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, claimed the man was simply making up his own signs . Address: U.S. President Barack Obama addresses the crowd while the interpreter stands next to him . Mis-matched: The man's movement's did not match that of the official interpreter, left . He . said he did not tell the company that contracted him for the event for . about $85 that he was due for the checkup, but said the owner of SA . Interpreters in Johannesburg was aware of his condition. Jantjie . said he received one year of sign language interpretation at a school . in Cape Town, and insisted that he has previously interpreted at many . events without anyone complaining. The AP showed Jantjie video footage of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service. 'I don't remember any of this at all,' he said. Today a South African deputy Cabinet minister admitted 'a mistake happened' in hiring Mr Jantjie. Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said that government officials have tried to track down the company that provided Mr Jantjie but that the owners 'have vanished into thin air.' Deputy Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities Bogopane-Zulu apologized to deaf people offended around the world by what they say was Jantjie's incomprehensible signing. She says an investigation is under way to determine how Jantjie received a security clearance. South Africa's leading deaf association had yesterday claimed he was a fake and said he was inventing signs. Mr Jantjie has apologised for the incident and said he did not know what triggered the attack, saying he took medication for his schizophrenia . However, in a radio interview Mr Jantjie . said he was happy with his performance at the memorial to the . anti-apartheid hero, who died a week ago aged 95. He told Talk Radio 702: 'Absolutely, absolutely. I think that I've been a champion of sign language.' According to The Sun, Twitter users with sign language knowledge claimed the interpreter repeatedly used signs for 'donkey', 'lightning bolt' and 'prawns'. Eye Witness News meanwhile has reported trained sign language trainers said he also made reference to 'rocking horses'. Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, has said he believed the interpreter was making up signs as he went along.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:46 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:07 EST, 12 December 2013 . Major League Baseball officials have announced that they intend to ban home plate collisions by 2015 at the latest in response to a series of bone-crunching injuries. New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, chairman of the rules committee, made the announcement yesterday at the winter meetings. He said the change would go into effect for next season if the players' association approved. Bone crunching: San Francisco Giants catcher . Buster Posey's leg snaps as he's struck by Florida Marlins' Scott . Cousins in 2011. The incident fuelled a decision to ban home . plate collisions in Major League Baseball . Posey is helped from the field: The collision . ended his season after he suffered a broken bone in his lower left leg . and three torn ligaments in his ankle. MLB authorities hope to ban home . plate collisions by 2015 latest . Safety and concern over concussions were major factors - fans still cringe at the memory of the season-ending hit Buster Posey absorbed in 2011. Meanwhile, the NFL was forced to reach a settlement last summer in a concussion-related lawsuit by former players for $765million, and a group of hockey players sued the NHL last month over brain trauma. 'Ultimately what we want to do is change the culture of acceptance that these plays are ordinary and routine and an accepted part of the game,' said Alderson. 'The costs associated in terms of health and injury just no longer warrant the status quo.' The announced has been met with a mixed response among current and former players. During his 13-year career as an All-Star catcher, Mike Scioscia earned a reputation for being as tough as anyone when it came to blocking home plate. But in a sport filled with nostalgia, even Scioscia wouldn't mind seeing a few modifications. 'I think everyone is in agreement that the mindless collisions at home plate where a catcher is being targeted by a runner, that needs to be addressed,' the Los Angeles Angels manager said. 'When I was growing up as a kid in Philadelphia, it was a badge of honour. You were expected to hang in at the plate, and the runner was expected to do everything he could to tag the plate. 'We're going back 40 years ago, but the mindset has changed a bit.' 'What's the game coming to?': Cincinnati Reds' Pete Rose slams into Cleveland Indians' Ray Fosse to score a . controversial game-winning run the 1970 All-Star game in Cincinnati. Rose says he opposes the rules change . But not everyone is pleased. Pete Rose, who famously flattened Ray Fosse to score the winning run in the 1970 All-Star game, was bowled over. 'What are they going to do next, you can't break up a double play?' Rose said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press after MLB announced its plan yesterday. 'You're not allowed to pitch inside. The hitters wear more armor than the Humvees in Afghanistan. Now you're not allowed to try to be safe at home plate?' Rose said. 'What's the game coming to? Evidently the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball.' Banned for life in 1989 following a gambling investigation, Rose insists Fosse was blocking the plate without the ball, which is against the rules. Fosse injured a shoulder, and his career went into a tailspin. 'Since 1869, baseball has been doing pretty well,' Rose said. 'The only rules they ever changed was the mound (height) and the DH. I thought baseball was doing pretty good. Maybe I'm wrong about the attendance figures and the number of people going to ballgames.' Alderson said wording of the rules change will be presented to owners for approval at their January 16 meeting in Paradise Valley, Arizona. Details must be sorted out, such as what should happen if a catcher blocks the plate without the ball. 'The exact language and how exactly the rule will be enforced is subject to final determination,' he said. 'We're going to do fairly extensive review of the types of plays that occur at home plate to determine which we're going to find acceptable and which are going to be prohibited.' Approval of the players' union is needed for the rules change to be effective for 2014. 'If the players' association were to disapprove, then the implementation of the rule would be suspended for one year, but could be implemented unilaterally after that time,' Alderson said. Another heavy tackle: In Game Five of this year's AL championship series, Detroit backstop Alex Avila was pulled a couple of innings after being run over at the plate by Boston's David Ross, a fellow catcher . The union declined to comment, pending a review of the proposed change. Some players spoke up on Twitter. 'No more home plate collisions?! What is this? NFL quarterbacks are catchers now?' Oakland outfielder Josh Reddick wrote. 'Nothing better than getting run over and showing the umpire the ball. Please don't ban home plate collisions,' Pittsburgh rookie catcher Tony Sanchez posted. Discussion to limit or ban collisions has intensified since May 2011, when Posey was injured as the Marlins' Scott Cousins crashed into him at the plate. Posey, San Francisco's All-Star catcher, sustained a broken bone in his lower left leg and three torn ligaments in his ankle, an injury that ended his season. Posey returned to win the NL batting title and MVP award in 2012, when he led the Giants to their second World Series title in three seasons. In Game Five of this year's AL championship series, Detroit backstop Alex Avila was pulled a couple of innings after being run over at the plate by Boston's David Ross, a fellow catcher. 'This is, I think, in response to a few issues that have arisen,' Alderson said. 'One is just the general occurrence of injuries from these incidents at home plate that affect players, both runners and catchers. And also kind of the general concern about concussions that exists not only in baseball but throughout professional sports and amateur sports today.' Former catchers Joe Girardi, Bruce Bochy and Mike Matheny - all now managing in the majors - attended yesterday's meeting. 'I don't think it's completely sparked by anything that's happened in baseball as much as what's happening outside of baseball and how it's impacting people and impacting the welfare of each sport,' said Matheny, now managing the St Louis Cardinals. MLB intends to have varied tiers of punishment. 'I think there will be two levels of enforcement,' Alderson said. 'One will be with respect to whether the runner is declared safe or out based on conduct. 'So, for example, intentionally running over the catcher might result in an out call. So I think that the enforcement will be on the field as well as subsequent consequences in the form of fines and suspensions and the like.' The NCAA instituted a rule on collisions for the 2011 season, saying 'contact above the waist that was initiated by the base runner shall not be judged as an attempt to reach the base or plate.' The umpire can call the runner out and also eject the player if contact is determined to be malicious or flagrant. Drafting the big league rule figures to be complicated. 'Does it include at every base or just home plate?' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.","Rules change to come into effect by 2015, or earlier if players' union agrees .

A southeast Wisconsin man who recorded himself sexually assaulting six young children gave a slight smirk as a judge admonished him for his crimes, leaving the judge taken aback for a moment before he sentenced the Racine man to the maximum 145 years in prison. Alexander R. Richter, 30, had just apologized for molesting a two-year-old girl and five other young children. He also acknowledged that his words could do nothing to undo the damage he'd caused. But the corner of his mouth turned upward slightly as Judge Timothy Boyle recounted Richter's comments to a pre-sentencing investigator. 'You said you feel sorry for [the children], that you ruined their whole lives. But you smiled as you said it,' Boyle noted. He paused for a moment and then noted with incredulity, 'You're smiling now!' Smirking: Alexander R. Richter, 30, prepares to leave the courtroom following his sentencing hearing at the Racine County Circuit Court on Thursday in Racine, Wisconsin . Richter pleaded no contest in September to four charges related to child sexual assault. In exchange prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of 80 years. A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for the purposes of sentencing. Horrific crimes: Alexander Richter befriended classmates who were parents, offered to babysit their children then filmed himself sexually abusing them . Boyle, who was not bound by the terms of the agreement, noted that Richter would be 110 by the time his sentence ended, adding that crimes as depraved as his deserved an even harsher penalty to ensure he died behind bars. The strongest evidence against Richter were his own videos, which he recorded while molesting at least six children ages two-and-a-half to six. Prosecutors say Richter's pedophilic crimes began when he was a teenager and that there might be other victims who haven't been identified. Richter even titled one of the DVDs the videos were found on 'Monster Unleashed.' It showed multiple scenes of Richter abusing three related girls and separate scenes with a young boy, the complaint said. One video showed a naked girl crying and fighting off Richter, the criminal complaint said. Boyle . hesitated to even mention the DVD's title, noting that three anguished . relatives of the victims were huddled together in the courtroom. The . relatives declined to speak before or after the sentencing. One family . provided a written statement to the judge, but he did not divulge its . contents. Before he was sentenced Richter, clad in an orange prison jumpsuit, offered a quiet apology. 'I'd just like to say I'm sorry,' he said. 'It doesn't even feel like that should be good enough for the court.' Investigators say Richter, who was studying accounting at a technical college in hopes of joining his father's business, befriended vulnerable families and persuaded them to let him babysit their children. He then groomed the children for sex by buying them gifts and doing favors for them, the complaint said. Guilty: Alexander R. Richter, 30, listens as he is sentenced to 145 years in prison by Judge Timothy Boyle . 'What kind of person does that other than someone who's deeply disturbed or, as I said, evil,' the judge said. 'Even though you didn't kill anybody, you killed something inside those children.' Boyle noted that Richter's youngest victim, a two-and-a-half-year-old girl, was still in diapers when he molested her. The comment drew sobs from one woman in the court. Neither Richter nor his public defender, Margaret Johnson, objected to the allegations listed by the judge or prosecutor Robert Repischak. Investigators said Richter was caught after a six-year-old boy told his mother that Richter had abused the boy and his four-year-old sister. When detectives served Richter with a search warrant, he told them, 'I'll save you time, the things you are looking for are under the coffee table,' according to the complaint. Officers found DVDs and camera equipment. Richter originally was charged with 49 felonies, including first-degree child sexual assault, sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography. The charges carried a maximum penalty of 1,185 years in prison.","Alexander Richter, 30, was sentenced to 145 years for sexually assaulting young children .

Miss Darwin, who served with the Royal Logistics Corps, was finally accepted into the army after her first application was rejected on health grounds. Alex Darwin, 24, suffered from leukaemia when she was a child and then joined the British Army at the age of 17. She left after a tour of duty in Afghanistan but is now rejoining after realising she should never have left . She said: ‘I've never been able to sit back and take it easy. I was on a ward with other children who did not get better, so my whole life has felt like a second chance which I needed to make the most of. ‘For me it's important to do well in life. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't, and for that reason, I'm determined not to be a failure.’ Miss Darwin, of Rhyl, North Wales, underwent 30 months of intensive treatment after being diagnosed with leukaemia when she was just four years old. She said: ‘It was a big moment when I lost my hair. Until that point I'd had long, beautiful hair, so I went from one extreme to another. ‘I was on a ward at Alder Hey Children's Hospital with a girl called Lucy. When my parents asked me what we should name my sister, who was born while I was in hospital, I asked them to name her Lucy after the girl I was in hospital with. ‘Lucy was my best friend on the ward, but sadly she passed away while I got better.’ Ms Darwin (pictured in hospital when she was five) had 30 months of intensive treatment after being diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of four . Ms Darwin (pictured recently while on holiday in Paris) said: 'I've never been able to sit back and take it easy. I was on a ward with other children who did not get better, so my whole life has felt like a second chance which I needed to make the most of' After being given the all-clear at age seven, Miss Darwin returned to school, only to experience bullying. She said: ‘I was cancer-free but my immune system had taken a knock and I got pneumonia and meningitis, meaning I missed even more school. ‘As a result I felt unusual and singled-out. At primary school one boy kept slapping my bald head, and at secondary school I felt alienated, as if I was someone who was sickly and diseased.’ She was inspired to join the British Army shortly after leaving school when she was 16. She said: ‘The army was a fresh chance to prove myself. I began intensive endurance training and was determined to be accepted. Ms Darwin (pictured with a friend) said: 'Young people who have suffered with difficult illnesses do not have to let those illnesses define the rest of their lives - if you have an ambition, then you should go for it' Ms Darwin (pictured in Helmand) was initially rejected by the army because of her health problems in childhood but she was accepted after her mother helped her appeal against the decision . Ms Darwin (pictured in hospital at the age of five) said: 'For me it's important to do well in life. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't, and for that reason, I'm determined not to be a failure' ‘I received a letter back which said I would never be fit enough to meet army standards because of my previous illnesses. ‘I was absolutely gutted, but my parents started the appeal process for me. That was a very significant gesture for my mother. She didn't want me to join up because she thought I'd get hurt, but she knew it was my dream.’ Finally, in 2007 when she was 17, Miss Darwin joined 27 Regiment RLC, based at Aldershot. She said: ‘I remember breaking down in tears - I had been waiting for so long, and my dream was coming true. ‘The day I went to basic training I was really excited. I didn't get homesick, even when I was out in Afghanistan.’ Miss Darwin (pictured during basic training at the age of 17) says her experiences prove survivors of childhood illnesses need not let early trauma prevent them achieving their aims in life . After her illness, Ms Darwin returned to school but was bullied because she had lost her hair and was often ill because her immune system was weak. She says the bullying meant she felt she needed to prove herself . Miss Darwin's tour of duty placed her as a defensive gunner on supply trucks serving the front lines in Helmand during the summer of 2008. ‘I was on operations the majority of the time - top cover, manning machine guns as we went through the desert and villages. We were attacked with gunfire and by suicide bombers and I saw a couple of vehicles hit by roadside bombs. ‘There were a lot of repatriation ceremonies to attend to - not just British but Americans, Estonians and Danish. ‘I remember seeing an ambulance come into Camp Bastion carrying a lad who had been accidentally shot in the head while his pal was clearing a 50 calibre gun. ‘We were coming to the end of an operation and were at a forward operating base in the Green Zone, when we were attacked with mortars. Miss Darwin's tour of duty placed her as a defensive gunner on supply trucks serving the front lines in Helmand during the summer of 2008 . ‘I was lying on my truck in my sleeping bag thinking, “in two weeks I'll be at home”, when I heard a sound like a firework. ‘I had just enough time to roll onto the ground and get into an armoured section of my truck before the mortar round landed. I hated mortars - you just didn't know where the round would end up.’ Miss Darwin chose to leave the army in December 2009 and took on various roles, including a youth work volunteering position supporting her father Bill, a town councillor, which she still does. This winter she made the decision to re-enlist in the army and hopes to enter a full application in early 2014. Ms Darwin said: 'I came to realise that I never really wanted to leave the army - it was a long-held dream, and I was good at it. I know I can do it - because I've managed to get past all the hurdles before' She said: ‘I came to realise that I never really wanted to leave the army - it was a long-held dream, and I was good at it. ‘I know I can do it - because I've managed to get past all the hurdles before. ‘I know other young people who have applied for the forces and been declined for health reasons and have just given up. I want people to realise that they shouldn't give up. ‘Young people who have suffered with difficult illnesses do not have to let those illnesses define the rest of their lives - if you have an ambition, then you should go for it.’","Alex Darwin was diagnosed with leukaemia when she was four years old .

Warring genes could be the cause of  hot flushes (pictured) that menopausal women can experience, scientists said . At last women have someone to blame for the menopause – their parents. Scientists claim that the hormonal mayhem is the result ‘genetic warfare’ between the DNA a woman inherits from her mother and that of her father. One set of genes wants her to continue having children. The other wants her to stop. The result is the hot flushes, mood swings, night sweats and other symptoms that go to make up the menopause. The British and Japanese researchers said that learning more about the genes involved could lead to a test that tells a woman how long she has in which to start a family. The study builds on the popular idea that the menopause evolved as a way of stopping our female ancestors from having children while they were still young enough to help care for the children of younger female relatives living nearby. This allowed them to safeguard their genetic line, by lavishing their children and those of relatives with love and attention, without having to go through the trauma of childbirth again. The team featured researchers from Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL), St Andrews University in Scotland and Sokendai, the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Hayama, Japan. They say that, in times gone by, women tended to move away from home and in with their husband’s family once they got married. This meant their children would typically be related to more of those around them through their father than their mother. As a result, the genes a girl inherited from her father would in adulthood strive to stop her from having more children of her own so she could instead care for young relatives around her. However, the DNA she got from her mother would want her to have more children of her own, to help ensure the genes from her mother’s side lived on. RHUL researcher Dr Francisco Ubeda, who used maths to back up the theory, said: ‘The woman’s paternal genes are pushing for an earlier menopause, while her maternal genes are trying to stall the process.’ This conflict of interest could explain not only why women go through the menopause but also why it lasts so long and is so turbulent, the journal Ecology Letters reports. The study will be used to inform the development of personalised family planning (the pill is pictured) and preventative medicine for treating cardiovascular problems and even some cancers . St Andrews University researcher Dr . Andy Gardner said learning more about the genes involved in menopause . could help women decide how long to wait to start a family. He . said: ‘Now, when people are trying to decide, the best bit of advice . they can be given is to look at the age their mother underwent the . menopause.’ Dr Ubeda added: ‘Choosing if and when to start a family is one of the biggest decisions that we have to make in our lives. ‘Having . better, individualised information about when our fertility is likely . to tail off will help avoid anxiety and make sure that people don’t . leave it too late.’ The . research could also help doctors decide which methods of family . planning they should  prescribe, based on a woman’s genetic background. In . the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause – when their . ovaries stop producing an egg every four weeks – is 52, although many . experience it in their 30s or 40s. Earlier . research found that the drop in oestrogen levels during the menopause . could be linked to the ‘senior moments’ suffered by older women but that . hormone replacement therapy (HRT) helped.","Researchers from the UK and Japan discovered that a woman's genes are conflicted during the menopause, resulting in side effects .

Battle-fatigued and suddenly bipartisan, the House voted on Thursday night to ease across-the-board federal spending cuts and head off future government shutdowns, acting after Speaker John Boehner unleashed a stinging attack on tea party-aligned conservative groups campaigning for the measure's defeat. The legislation, backed by the White House, cleared on a vote of 332-94, with lopsided majorities of Republicans and Democrats alike voting in favor. Final passage is expected next week in the Senate. The events in the House gave a light coating of bipartisan cooperation to the end of a bruising year of divided government - memorable for a partial government shutdown, flirtation with an unprecedented Treasury default and gridlock on immigration, gun control and other items on President Barack Obama's second-term agenda. Scroll down for video . House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio vehemently rebuked conservative groups who opposed Thursday's bipartisan budget compromise which the House voted through . Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, hailed the vote, saying it 'shows Washington can and should stop governing by crisis and both sides can work together to get things done.' Minutes after the budget action, the House approved a broad military policy bill that aims to curb sexual assaults, cover combat pay for U.S. forces and fund new aircraft and ships. That vote, too, was lopsided, 350-69, sending the bill to the Senate, which plans to adjourn for the year next week. In the end, the budget debate in the House was tame by comparison with Boehner's criticism of Republican-favoring outside groups that at times have been more of an obstacle to him than Democrats. 'I think they're misleading their followers,' the Republican speaker said of the groups, whom he pointedly also blamed for last fall's politically damaging partial government shutdown. 'I think they're pushing our members in places where they don't want to be. And frankly, I just think that they've lost all credibility by opposing legislation before the details are known.' Sen. Patty Murray, center, helped to negotiate the budget agreement which will set overall spending levels for the current budget year and the one that begins on Oct. 1, 2014 . He mentioned no organizations by name, although it appeared he was referring to Heritage Action and Club for Growth, both of which have sought to push the House further to the right than the Republican leadership has been willing to go. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a chief GOP architect of the deal, made the conservatives' case for support. The measure 'reduces the deficit by $23 billion. It does not raise taxes and it cuts spending in a smarter way,' said the Budget Committee's chairman, whose handiwork could well be challenged in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. The second-ranking Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, joined other party leaders in swinging behind the measure, even though he noted that he represents 62,000 federal workers and said future government employees will pay higher pensions costs because of the bill. 'This agreement is better than the alternative' of ever deeper across-the-board cuts, he said. The agreement, negotiated by Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington - and endorsed by the White House - would set overall spending levels for the current budget year and the one that begins on Oct. 1, 2014. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a chief GOP architect of the deal, made the conservatives' case for support . That straightforward action would probably eliminate the possibility of another government shutdown and reduce the opportunity for the periodic brinkmanship of the kind that has flourished in the current three-year era of divided government. The measure would erase $63 billion in across-the-board cuts set for January and early 2015 on domestic and defense programs, leaving about $140 billion in reductions in place. On the other side of the budget ledger, it projects savings totaling $85 billion over the coming decade, enough to show a deficit reduction of about $23 billion over the 10-year period. The cuts would be replaced with savings generated from dozens of sources. Among them are higher airline security fees, curbs on the pension benefits of new federal workers and additional costs for corporations whose pensions are guaranteed by the federal government. The measure also would slow the annual cost-of-living increase in benefits for military retirees under the age of 62. The bill includes a 90-day provision that postpones a 20 percent cut in reimbursements for doctors who treat Medicare patients and replaces it with an increase of one-half of one percent. Without naming names, Boehner pointedly also blamed tea party-aligned conservative groups for last fall's politically damaging partial government shutdown . The combination of short-term spending increases and long-term savings would send deficits higher for the current budget year and each of the next two, a dramatic departure from the conservative orthodoxy that Republicans have enforced since taking control of the House three years ago. That was a step too far for many Republicans, including some seeking election to the Senate next year. Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia, one of several Senate hopefuls from his state, said he would vote against the legislation. He said the existing across-the-board cuts 'have a tendency to cut out muscle with fat, but it's still the only tool in town for cutting spending.' Rep. Tom Cotton, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, announced his opposition, too, and said the legislation 'busts the spending caps that took effect just months ago by spending billions now in exchange for supposed long-term spending cuts.' Other Republicans said despite shortcomings, the bill was the best the party could get in divided government. 'We have Republican and Democratic-controlled houses and as a result no one solution is possible,' said Rep. Darrell Issa of California. Echoing Boehner's sentiments, he said of the outside groups, 'What do they want, another government shutdown? If so, they ought to run for Congress.' Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, hailed the vote, saying it 'shows Washington can and should stop governing by crisis and both sides can work together to get things done' Democrats were conflicted, but for different reasons. There was general support for easing across-the-board reductions in programs like education, Head Start and transportation - deficit reduction that Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York called a disaster. Yet Democrats were unhappy that the measure lacked an extension of unemployment benefits due to expire on Dec. 28. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland asked for a separate vote on that issue, but Republicans refused. The expiring program provides benefits to unemployed workers who have been without work for more than 26 weeks. The cost of a one-year extension was put at $25 billion. The debate on the House floor was overshadowed by Boehner's comments at his news conference. The speaker, who famously says he is not affected by stress, has been criticized by some Republicans this year who accuse him of buckling under pressure from outside groups and their allies in the rank and file. He was elected to a second term as speaker in January after an attempt by some rebels to oust him collapsed. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., leaves the chamber on Thursday evening just before the House held final votes before leaving for the holiday recess, at the Capitol in Washington . The October shutdown seemed on Boehner's mind. 'They pushed us into this fight to defund ""Obamacare"" and to shut down the government. ... That wasn't exactly the strategy that I had in mind,' he said. 'But if you recall, the day before the government reopened, one of the people that - one of these groups stood up and said, well, we never really thought it would work. Are you kidding me?' Boehner's remarks were part of a broader response by the Republican establishment as it struggles to counter the influence of organizations like Heritage Action, the Club For Growth, and the Senate Conservatives Fund. The Senate Republican campaign organization, effectively an extension of the leadership, let it be known it would not give any business to Jamestown Associates, an advertising firm that has worked for the Senate Conservatives Fund. Republican officials have urged traditional political allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to step up their involvement in campaigns as a way to counter the influence of tea party-aligned groups, and in one or two cases, have noted with satisfaction that particularly hard-line rebels in the House will face primary challengers next year. Boehner said the GOP leadership has had enough tea party-driven intransigence in Congress and he doesn'­t care what they think . Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action, rebuffed Boehner's accusation that opposition to the legislation was uninformed. 'Everything was widely known about what this deal was. We were concerned it was going to increase spending in the near term, and it does. We were concerned it was going to increase deficits in the near term and it does.' The Club for Growth issued a statement that took no note of Boehner's comments. It urged lawmakers to oppose the legislation, calling it 'a deliberate attempt to avoid modest but much needed spending cuts in exchange for the promise of spending cuts in the future.'","Bipartisan budget deal was voted through 332-94 on Thursday night to head off future government shutdowns .

A Michigan senator admitted she was a rape victim Wednesday in a last ditch effort to stop a measure that would force women to buy additional insurance to cover abortions. Despite Democractic Senator Gretchen Whitmer sharing her personal horror story, the  Senate and House ended up passing the measure into law yesterday. The Senate passed the measure on a 27-11 vote with a 62-47 vote in the House. Now, when Michigan women find themselves in an unwanted pregnancy, insurance will not cover the costs of an abortion unless the woman invested in special coverage. Scroll down for video . This time it's personal: Senator Gretchen Whitmer shared her personal story of being raped in college Wednesday as she tried to get a measure on abortion insurance put to public vote . Initially, Senator Minority Leader Whitmer tried to get a male colleague to share his story of how a planned pregnancy had to end in an abortion procedure. But she realized she shouldn't force someone else to tell their emotional story if she wasn't brave enough to share her own. Senator Whitmer spoke publicly for the first time about the rape she endured in college 20 years ago, a nightmare she hadn't even told her father about. 'And thank god it didn't result in a pregnancy, because I can't imagine going through what I went through and then having to consider what to do about an unwanted pregnancy,' she said. She goes on to explain that if the measure were law then and she become pregnant, she would have had to pay for an abortion out of pocket unless she 'thought ahead and planned for it'. Whitmer says she 'can't even imagine' what she would do if one of her own daughters went through the same horrifying experience. According to MIRS, she is married to Dr Marc Mallory, a Lansing dentist. 'I'm not the only woman in our state who has faced that horrible circumstance,' she said. 'I'm not enjoying talking about it. It's something I've hidden for a long time.' Ms Whitmer was joined by other state representatives who shared their personal stories of abortion. They were trying to block the measure from becoming law without a state-wide vote first. Democratic Representative Colleen Lamonte spoke about the dilation and curettage procedure she went through after a miscarriage.

According to TMZ, the family say that experts have told them the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane and the driver to lose control . It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fibre frame and 5.7 litre race-derived V10 engine. It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models. Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity . when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ, a memo . circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot . drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.' 'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.) 'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar. The actor's family claims that experts say the crash could have been caused by Botts' Dots in the road - raised plastic markers that separate traffic lanes . Walker is pictured in the car moments before it careered off the road and hit a tree killing him and the driver . Police have revealed that a second man . has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche . that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed. Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges. According to the California Department of Transportation, Botts' Dots were invented by Dr Elbert D Botts as a way of making the painted lines that separate lanes in the road last longer. The plastic raised bumps were eventually made mandatory in California and have since become popular on roads across the world. There are 20million Botts' Dots on Californian roads. The dots also alert drivers when they drift out of their lane. Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site. The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offence. Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram. The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed. The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police. The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft. A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof. Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intensions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it.

Mystery: Neither Taylor, pictured, or Dayton lived in the Daybreak home, and police say the investigation is ongoing . Guns: Authorities have been unable to confirm where the three guns found near the bodies of Dayton, left, and Taylor, right, came from, who owns them and even if they were used in the shooting . Winkler said that the three had been . fingerprinted, photographed and swabbed for DNA samples. The older boy . has also been interviewed. South Jordan Police emphasized that this case is still on 'ongoing' and a 'very active investigation.' Authorities . are still awaiting the final medical examiner's report, the toxicology . report, ballistics report and will conduct more interviews . 'This . is a tragedy. The family's devastated. We really don't have any words . to say. It's hard, very hard. These kids were so young with so much life . ahead of them,' Shawn Graham, Dayton's uncle, told the Deseret News. An . off duty policeman driving by the home discovered the Copper Mountain . Middle School students' bodies at around 4:30 p.m. after another boy who . was at the residence at the time ran onto the street and waved him . down. Scene: The boys were found dead in the basement of 4781 W. Pine Canyon Way, pictured in the Daybreak community of South Jordan, Utah. Neither boy lived at the home . Family: Taylor's mother Charle Meier and her two daughters attend a candlelight vigil on November 15 to pay respects to the boys . Authorities have been unable to confirm where the guns came from, who owns them and even if they were used in the shooting. The boys' family and friends held a vigil for them Sunday night and more than 100 people turned out to remember the students and support their loved ones. Dayton was described as an incredible young man who loved baseball and wanted to be an engineer. While Taylor was a fun-loving kid who enjoyed making people laugh. Taylor's friend Drew Francom left a dollar bill on a picnic table for his pal. He said he was looking for change recently and asked Taylor, but at the moment the boy did not have money. Then later at lunch, Taylor found Drew again and gave him the dollar he needed. Respects: Kendyll Stewart, left, is comforted by Tayler Nicole, as they attend a candlelight vigil on Sunday, November 17, 2013, in memory of Taylor Wheeler and Dayton Gessell . 'I never got to pay him back,' Francom said. 'So I brought him a dollar.' Graham said his nephew was clever and had an exciting future ahead of him. '(Dayton) was amazing with math. You could throw him a math problem and he didn't have to write it down. He could just hammer it out,' he said. Taylor's mother, Charlé Meier, told the Salt Lake Tribune the vigil was important because everyone who knew and loved her son and Dayton needed somewhere to be together and deal with the sudden loss. Crying, and holding her two daughters close, she said: 'We're lighting candles for lights extinguished too soon. They were just boys.' Later, Meier stood on a picnic table and passed around notebooks so people could write down messages for the boys. 'Nobody got to say goodbye,' she said.","Promising students Taylor Wheeler, 12, and Dayton Gessell, 15, were found dead on November in the basement of a home in South Jordan, Utah .

"By . Frances Hubbard . PUBLISHED: . 20:02 EST, 13 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:07 EST, 14 December 2013 . Snugly wrapped in a stripey towel, the little orphan with heart-melting black eyes wriggles impatiently as he waits for his next feed. He doesn’t have long to wait, and soon he’s tucking into his lunch with as much gusto as any hungry infant. As any parent knows, baby meal times can be messy and time-consuming affairs. So try to imagine what it’s like being entrusted with the care of 58 noisy . . . seal pups. These impossibly cute waifs and strays are being cared for by exhausted staff at the RSPCA rescue centre in East Winch, West Norfolk, after an unprecedented number were brought in for emergency care following last week’s freak storms and tidals surges. Too young to swim properly or fend for themselves, they were torn from their mothers in the high seas and swept helplessly on to the beaches of East Anglia. Scroll down for video . Vulnerable: 58 baby seal pups have been rescued from the East Anglian coast after last week's storm surge . A record 60 starving and pitiful creatures were brought to East Winch by members of the public or RSPCA officers, and staff are working around the clock to keep them alive in a hastily- assembled creche. ‘It’s been absolute chaos,’ says bleary-eyed East Winch manager Alison Charles. ‘We have never had this many seals before in one go, and I’ve been here for two decades. ‘There was barely a chance to think. It was one arrival after another: bam, bam bam. ‘They started coming in on the day after the storm, and by Saturday we realised that we were short of pretty much everything we needed to cope. I went to the local Tesco and started throwing supplies into my trolley as if I was on Supermarket Sweep. ‘I worked through my last weekend off and everyone’s putting in extra hours.’ (If anyone reading this has an industrial liquidiser going spare, by the way, East Winch is still looking for one. Their existing model is threatening a nervous breakdown under the stress of catering on such a large scale.) For, without the ready supply of their mothers’ high-calorie milk, if these pups are to have any chance of survival, they need up to five meals a day of a soup made from mashed-up raw fish and an oral rehydration solution. Helping Hand: A seal being fed and cared for at the RSPCA wildlife hospital in East Winch, Norfolk . But getting nourishment into the . unweaned pups is no easy job: they have to be fed with a tube and seals, . being torpedo-shaped, are very good at slipping through human hands. The process of feeding all the infants takes a laborious two hours — . before it starts all over again. Oh . yes, and the staff also have to administer antibiotics, tend wounds, . scrub the floors and care for the other creatures — from swans to . hedgehogs — that come into the centre. No . wonder that the devoted wildlife officers, clad in regulation white . boiler suits and wellies, seem a little frayed round the edges. The 21 core staff have called . in favours from retired old hands and there is even an RSPCA Chief . Inspector — Simon Davies, usually based in Staffordshire — stoically . washing feeding tubes at the kitchen sink. The nerve centre for the seal rescue is a white-tiled isolation unit with 17 cubicles. The unit might be designed to house anything from foxes to otters, but it’s currently wall-to-wall pups, all of them sharing quarters. The usual occupants, among them 140 sickly hedgehogs, have been moved to temporary accommodation in the visitor’s centre. Andrex puppy irresistible, not only do the big-eyed seal babies look adorable, but the cry of a motherless seal pup is pitiful and disconcertingly human. Seal of approval: One rather disheveled pup gets to know Frances Hubbard . Their wailing triggers my maternal instincts, but the impulse to comfort a pup with a cuddle must be resisted. I . am told I am not allowed to touch them and RSPCA staff try to keep . physical contact to an absolute minimum. The pups need to be released . back into the wild and it is important they do not form attachments to . humans. Whether the humans can resist forming attachments to the pups is another matter. Alison confesses: . ‘They . are gorgeous animals so it’s easy to get a bit soppy about them, but we . remember at all times that they’re going back to the wild and their own . kind. ‘The reality is . that they are also strong, with very sharp teeth and the older ones can . be aggressive when they feel under threat. ‘One . lady who brought in a pup was bitten very badly on the cheek, simply . because the animal was terrified and was defending itself. But the . bottom line is that if we didn’t take them in, they would starve. Some . pups have arrived in a terrible state, seriously underweight and having . been mauled by dogs and other adult seals on beaches. It’s heartbreaking . to see them like that.’ Hanging about: A group of seals lay on the floor of the RSPCA wildlife hospital, waiting for their next feed . As . hard as it is to resist picking them up, the advice to members of the . public who find an abandoned seal is clear: leave them alone and call . the RSPCA. Each of the seals is given a name: not for ‘cutesy’ reasons, . Alison insists, but to help identify and track them, and a system has . been devised for keeping a record of each season’s arrivals. Every year, they are tagged and named according to a theme. In 2013, that theme has been ‘breakfasts.’ I spot Frosted Flake, Coddled Egg, Poached Egg, Scrambled Egg and Boiled Egg among the names written on marker boards pinned beside one of the cubicles, along with the patients’ medical notes. While their beseeching black eyes and winsome expressions would melt even Scrooge’s heart, there is a downside to housing these little orphans — the pong. Advice: Staff say the best thing for members of the public to do if they discover a pup is to call the RSPCA . As I enter a room containing 60 of them, I am almost knocked over by the stench of what seems like raw herring combined with a powerful undertow of wet dog and public convenience. The majority of the pups at the wildlife hospital are believed to have come from a 440-strong breeding colony at Horsey Gap near Great Yarmouth, further east on the Norfolk coast. The storms resulted in one of the highest tides on record for this stretch of coast, and struck at the worst possible time for grey seals, bang in the middle of the pupping season. What should happen is that a grey seal pup stays on land for their first three to four weeks, protected by his or her mother and gorging on her nutrient-rich milk. Pups increase in weight from 13kg to around 45kg during this time, building up valuable fat reserves. Or to use an analogy, they grow from cocker spaniels into alsatians. Out and about: Frances Hubbard stands next to a swimming pool - home to numerous rescued pups . The juveniles are protected from the cold by their characteristic thick, white coats, which offer high insulation but little water resistance. At a month old, the babies are weaned and a sleeker coat replaces their baby fluff, but if they are swept off the beaches before this time it can be catastrophic. Their white coats, which are designed for insulation, become waterlogged and many drown. Those who find land are often injured and always hungry. And survival is not guaranteed, even among the lucky ones who are rescued. The phenomenal rate of weight gain achieved in the wild is simply impossible to replicate with handrearing. The solution is to keep the pups for up to five months before they are fit enough to return to the sea. Now that East Winch, the biggest centre in the country, is at full stretch, other RSPCA sites are having to take some of the strain. I watch as Fried Egg, a 19kg pup, is wrapped in a mesh stretcher in preparation for the long journey to a centre in Taunton, Somerset. Apparently, seals are quite happy lolling in the back of a van for the duration of a road trip and generally go to sleep, lulled by the vibrations of the vehicle. The driver, however, is advised not to stop at any service stations. These pups can be as naughty as any human toddler. A baby seal, even an underweight and sickly patient, is surprisingly fast and powerful. Adorable: The RSPCA has now launched a crisis appeal to support the pups' rehabilitation . At one point during my visit, Alison has to break from sorting out medicines to stop one of her charges from escaping through a momentarily unguarded door and trying to take a swim in a trough of disinfectant used to clean staff wellies. The pups are kept in the isolation unit until they are six weeks old, when they move to shallow indoor bathing pools until they are adult enough to go in larger pools outside. Once they are old enough, they will be taken on stretchers and released into the water at Sutton Bridge near . King’s Lynn, enabling them to swim into The Wash, and out to sea on the outgoing tide. But first there are thousands of meals to prepare and dish up. Not surprisingly, with each seal costing £22 a week to feed — and expected to stay at East Winch for five months — the RSPCA has launched a crisis appeal to support their rehabilitation. They hope people will give enthusiastically to help save these charismatic creatures. As Alison says: ‘Christmas hasn’t been too kind to these seals so far, but hopefully the public’s generosity will bring them a little bit of festive cheer.’ To make a donation towards the pups’ upkeep, text the RSPCA on 70070 with a message saying SEA L01 followed by the amount donated (e.g. SEA L01 £3). The call will cost the chosen amount plus the standard network rate message.","Staff at RSPCA rescue centre in East Winch, West Norfolk helping 58 seals .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 01:06 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:56 EST, 22 November 2013 . The Obama administration plans to delay by a full month the open enrollment period for Obamacare's second year, in a move that a Republican campaign strategist called 'nakedly political.' According to Healthcare.gov, the Department of Health and Human Service's official online portal for the Affordable Care Act, enrollment for 2015 is scheduled to begin on October 15, 2014 and end on December 7. But an HHS official said Thursday that the schedule has been bumped back, beginning on November 15, 2014 and ending on January 15, 2015. That timetable will ensure that the midterm elections come and go before the new year's insurance rates are published. 'Consumers will not see their 2015 premiums until after the midterm elections, instead of immediately before,' an APCO Worldwide Washington, D.C. managing director Mike Tuffin told Bloomberg. 'One doesn’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to divine the motive here.' The White House attracted widespread scorn in July when the Treasury Department also quietly announced a one-year delay of the Obamacare law's employer mandate, shelving the implementation of its stiffest penalties past the 2014 midterms. Cynical: The White House will find itself losing even more public confidence from the move to push back Obamacare's year-two insurance enrollment period until after Election Day . The shadow knows: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius hasn't commented publicly on the new calendar, which will ensure many voters won't know their 2015 insurance rates until after they've voted for members of congress . 'How . nakedly political can you get?' a Republican campaign strategist based . in a southern U.S. state asked when MailOnline reached him late on . Thursday. 'Are you kidding . me? This is like a high school delaying the SAT until a few weeks after . college acceptance letters come out,' he said. 'Next they're going to tell us that Santa won't put together his naughty-or-nice list until December 26.' An HHS official told Politico that the change is 'good news for consumers, who will have more time to learn about plans before enrolling.' But it will also postpone any resulting public sticker shock until after voters choose the members of the next Congress. Insurance companies will still be required to submit their policies to the federal government in mid-spring 2014, but consumers getting their coverage through the government's exchange will not find out how much they will pay until they shop online – 11 days after the election. Ana Gupte, an analyst at the investment firm Leerink Swann & Co., told Bloomberg that '[t]he death of this law would be for health insurance companies . to price policies for 2015 in a way that premiums skyrocket. At that . point, it’s a death spiral and it’s over.' The makeup of the next Congress will have a greater impact on the future health of Obamacare itself than any other factor. Republican control of both the House and Senate could lead to a complete defunding of the program during President Obama's final two years in office. The administration has plunged ahead with the Affordable Care Act despite public discontent, drawing charges that the White House is putting political considerations before the practical needs of consumers . All politics, all the time: Republicans will be hopping mad, judging from the reaction of one GOP campaign insuder . Year-one enrollment in Obamacare's exchanges has been fraught with one disaster after another. The government's online registration system's crashes, along with millions of private insurance cancellation letters, have combined to drive down consumer confidence in President Obama's signature legislature achievement. A CBS News poll released on Wednesday showed that just 1 in 10 Americans believe the Affordable Care Act's rollout is going well. Fully 48 per cent say they want the law repealed.","Voters in the insurance exchanges won't know until 11 days after the 2014 election just how much they'll pay for coverage in 2015 .

A new device that contains the information of all the credit cards you have in your wallet or purse has been developed by a company in San Francisco. Known as Coin, the company's plan is for for people to ditch the plastic, their bulging wallets and purses, and instead just use one single computerized card to handle all of your cash transactions. The way of the future: The Coin card aims to make paying with multiple credit cards simpler by incorporating everything you own onto one device . Past/Future: Coin wants to replace bulging wallets full of credit cards with a single device called a Coin (right) that can hold the information of all the cards you own . The seven-person start-up has introduced an all-in-one credit card on which users will be able to load all of their credit or debit card information. The clever part about the Coin card is that is uses a magnetic strip like any regular credit or debit card, however the information on the strip can change depending on what card the customer wants to use. A small microchip holds the information of up to eight cards securely in the device. The buyer is then able to switch between cards at the press of a button. However critics have claimed the device is nothing to get too excited about. As countries slowly move towards the more secure Chip & PIN credit card system, the Coin device is likely to become obsolete. Compact: The Coin car is sleek and small by a regular credit card but it can hold the information of up to eight others including debit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and membership cards . 'This is designed for the lifestyle of today with the technology of tomorrow,” says Kanishk Parashar, founder of Coin. 'You don’t need eight cards every day, so your phone is kind of like your drawer, and your Coin is kind of like your wallet.' Users then take photos of their cards, swipe them through the dongle and upload them to the Coin mobile app, which stores the info onto your Coin card. When you want to pay, you browse through stored cards on your Coin, select one, and swipe it anywhere credit, debit or gift cards are accepted. Information is loaded onto the card through a mobile app. The process of adding card information to the mobile app is very simple and is done by taking a picture or two and swiping credit cards through a dongle attached to your phone. Mobile payments remain an elusive area with a number of banks and card suppliers attempting to come up with a convenient, safe and secure solution. One card for all: Coin is fabricated with a patent-pending magnetic strip that can change depending on what card one wants to use. The battery in Coin is supposed to last up to two years . Convenient: The coin card is approximately the size of a single credit card that can store all your swipe-able cards and be used to pay everywhere cards are accepted, all in real time . In order to make a payment with this card, users tap a button on the Coin card and pick which account they want to pay with, whether it's a business credit card or a personal debit card. After picking an account, the Coin card is swiped through, no different than any other card. Both tech large and small have attempted to crack the mobile payments sector and any firm able to facilitate person-to-person or person-to-business transitions on a mass scale stands to gain significant profit off such payments. Will Oreumus, a blogger with FutureTense, isn't convinced the technology will takeoff. 'To . me, the only real problem with Coin is that it feels like a stopgap . technology, like those CD-changer cartridges that were popular for a . little while before everyone switched to mp3s. Replacing . eight cards with one may lighten your load by an ounce or two, but is . that enough to convince people to take the leap of faith involved in . adopting a new payment system? Even . early adopters could be forgiven for holding out for a more . comprehensive digital wallet—the kind that will let you pay for . everything just by tapping your phone, or perhaps some other, even more . seamless gesture.' Other . critics have said the card is not forward-thinking or future-proof . whatsoever. One claimed it was nothing more than 'old technology wrapped . up in a posh case.' 'This . is not at all useful overseas where Canada, Mexico and most of Europe . use Chip & PIN. In fact, it's typical American thinking whereby the . developers have only thought of themselves and not of the winder . consequences of usefulness of the product.Save your $100 if I were you!' How it works: Your credit cards and loaded onto the Coin app by swiping them in and taking a photo. The Coin card can then be used like a normal credit card . Smart card: The Coin card uses a Bluetooth emitter which means if the card is left behind for any reason the card will no longer function . The . battery in Coin, said to last up to two years, powers a small display . screen that shows which saved card will be charged, along with its . expiration date. Cards are entered into Coin after being swiped on a Square-like dongle plugged into a smartphone. There are also few worries about leaving the card behind somewhere or losing it altogether. The coin card only operates if your smartphone is nearby by using the Bluetooth signals. If the card is disconnected for more than ten minutes, the phone will alert the customer that they have left their card behind. If the owner drifts too far from Coin, his or her smartphone will alert them. If the card is disconnected for more than 10 minutes, it automatically disables itself, which could potentially be an issue if a phone runs out of juice. Coin can be preordered for $55, with an expected delivery time of 2014. Later, it plans on selling the cards for $100 each.","Coin allows you to load up to eight cards onto a single plastic device .

Tied up, stripped and pinned to the floor by his comrades who have applied sniper tape to his genitalia - these horrifying photographs show how one British soldier was bullied by his colleagues after he said he didn't want to go out drinking. Printed with the permission of the soldier, a teenager who has not given his name, they shed a shocking light on the brutal way he was treated at an army barracks in Germany. The alleged victim, a new recruit who is just 18, is now back in Britain after going absent without leave after the bullying episode, and faces time in military prison. Horrifying: The young soldier says he was pinned down, stripped and abused at a British army barracks . He says he is desperate to the leave the Army he had always dreamt of joining after bullying and abuse made his time in the Rifles division intolerable. The recruit, who joined the Army two days after his 16th birthday, says the abuse which was photographed took place in March this year after he told his colleagues, all Riflemen of the same rank as him, that he didn't want to go out drinking with them. He said he sensed something was going to happen and felt there was no way around being beaten, shortly before three men charged into his room. 'They stripped me and tied me up with sniper tape, then they wrapped a load of it around my head,' he said. He told the Sunday Mirror he was dragged into a corridor where several soldiers took his picture before going outside for a cigarette, leaving him there. The soldier says he managed to free himself, but days later the incident resurfaced when the distressing images of him were posted on Facebook. The young soldier says he expects to join the Rifles division for a five-month tour of Afghanistan, pictured, after serving time in a military prison for going absent without leave . An investigation was launched after Royal Military Police officers saw the photographs online and arrested a man, but the young victim was too frightened to talk to the investigating NCO. 'Before he started to ask me about it, I told him I knew why I was there but that there was nothing in it and I wasn't pressing any charges.' He said the officer did not push him on pressing charges, and the matter was left at that. The soldier said he understood that the pressures of life as a soldier meant some form of banter was bound to happen, but said when his fiancee in Britain saw the Facebook photographs she was appalled. 'If blokes have a problem with each other, they are allowed to fight it out' Alleged bullying victim, aged 18 . The teenager said there were often fist fights between soldiers at 5 Rifles' base near Paderborn in Germany, and blamed officers for 'turning a blind eye'. 'If blokes have a problem with each other, they are allowed to fight it out,' he said. He said the week he started training at Harrogate Army Foundation College, one youngster was pinned down and abused with a vacuum cleaner pipe. Months after the attack with the sniper tape, the soldier decided he could not face the legal complexity of ending his contract with the Army early, and he fled home to the UK. He says he knew what he was doing was serious and he knew he would be punished, but he had to get home to see his family. The soldier says he now expects to serve time in a military prison before joining his regiment for a five-month tour of Afghanistan. He signed for a four-year contract and says he can give notice after three years and hopes to be discharged soon after that. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'We can be clear that the Armed Forces have a zero tolerance approach to all forms of abuse, bullying, and discrimination. 'All allegations will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken. 'We have taken a number of steps to improve training and awareness concerning harassment and bullying to ensure that service personnel and their families know how to report concerns and what support is available to them.'","Soldier says he was bullied at British army barracks in Paderborn, Germany .

A father was stabbed repeatedly by burglars in front of his wife and daughter when he caught them raiding his house last night. The man, named by neighbours as Tony Abrahams, 47, walked into the three intruders on his landing after hearing his 23-year-old daughter, Jade, wake up and scream as they tried to take a television from her room. He was awoken by the noise and went to investigate, it is claimed. He tried to open his bedroom door, but found the burglars on the other side were holding it shut. The self-employed painter and decorator managed to force open the door, only to find himself confronted by three masked burglars on his landing. In the moments that followed, Tony was repeatedly stabbed by the intruders, who then fled the £200,000 Luton home. The trio, who all wore balaclavas, are thought to have made off in a black Astra. Mr Abrahams, said to be in a serious but stable condition, was taken to Luton and Dunstable Hospital after his wife Catrina, 52, and daughter raised the alarm at 3.25am. Today, Tony's two daughters briefly appeared to say: 'Dad is doing alright.' The gang are believed to have forced their way into the property as the family slept on Saturday night. Detectives say the three are thought to be aged between 14 and 20. Bedfordshire Police today confirmed no arrests have been made. Detective Constable Mo Hussain has appealed for details from witnesses who may have been in the area at the time or may have seen the three offenders either before or after the attack. Police say the home invaders held his bedroom door shut has he came to investigate his daughter's screams . Investigation: Officers outside the home of Mr Abrahams. They are seeking three men aged between 14 and 20 . Mr Abraham's two daughters today told reporters: 'Dad is doing alright' He said: 'This was an appalling attack on a family man within his own home and I would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak with us. 'While the victim has suffered some very nasty injuries, he is in a stable condition and has responded very well to treatment. 'There are a number of live leads and we are hopeful that we will establish the relevant evidence and identify the offenders.' Bedforshire Police are looking for three black males around 20 years old. A statement described the first . offender as a black male with light skin, around 20 years of age, five . feet one inch tall. The second offender was also a black male, five feet . ten inches tall. The third offender was a black male, around 20 years . old. Police say some property is missing. Detective Inspector Iain Morgan, who . is leading the hunt for the intruders, said that on hearing the sounds . of the break-in, Tony had got out of bed and went to investigate. 'He went to leave the room and then found the bedroom door was being held shut from the other side,' said the officer. Help: Reports claim Mr Abrahams (left) woke up to his daughter, Jade, 23 (right), screaming at men in her room . DI Morgan said anyone with information should contact Bedfordshire Police. He said 'I am appealing to members of the public, who may remember someone coming home really late in the early hours of Saturday morning, maybe hot and dishevelled and not themselves, to contact us.' It echoes the chilling case of hardworking pensioner Joseph Griffiths, 73, who was stabbed in his living room last year when he went to investigate noises. His wife Judith, 72, woke to shouts and screams downstairs in their £1million London home. She found her husband in a pool of blood and called paramedics but they were unable to save him. In February last year an elderly couple were stabbed to death by their Polish neighbour who had only been in the country for a week.

Judge Judy's district attorney son is under pressure to step down after he was accused of leaking grand jury information to help his personal trainer get off a child sex charge. Adam Levy, who serves as District Attorney Putnam County, New York, could face four years behind bars if he is charged and convicted of the leak. It relates to his former live-in trainer Alexandru Hossu who has been accused of raping a 12-year-old girl and bragging about his connections to the family. Arrest: Alexandru Hossu (left), an illegal immigrant, has been accused of raping a 12-year-old girl and (right) Judge Judy and her son Adam Levy, who serves as District Attorney for Putnam County, New York . New York State Senator Greg Ball said . 'questions have arisen as to whether Levy specifically communicated to . [Hossu] how the grand jury actually voted,' in addition to providing the . man with money, legal advice, key info and strategies. Senator Ball . told The ENQUIRER: 'Enough is enough! I am asking Adam Levy to either . step down or join me in my request that Governor Cuomo appoint an . independent special prosecutor to fully investigate the current fiasco . in Putnam County. 'We . have an elected district attorney who admits to having an illegal alien . living in his house, who is also an alleged rapist, and is now funding . the defense after telling the public he wasn’t involved.' It has since emerged that Hossu, who is originally from Romania, is allegedly an illegal immigrant after outstaying his visa - despite working for one of New York's top lawyers. Levy, the son of television personality 'Judge' Judy Scheindlin, has come under fire for employing Hossu, 35, and giving him accommodation at his million-dollar house in Putnam, New York. He has vehemently denied knowing about Hossu's immigration status and has become embroiled in a public scrap over the accusations with the sheriff of the county. Hossu was charged last week with two counts of first-degree rape after the 15-year-old daughter of a friend told a school counselor she had been sexually abused by him when she was 12. TV favourite: She is pictured speaking on her reality television courtroom series 'Judge Judy' He is accused of 'forcibly and violently' raping the 12-year-old girl twice in October 2010. It did not occur at Levy's home. While . the relative asked the girl about the rape after she revealed the . alleged attacks to her counselor, she simply said: 'I was told not to . say anything about it.' 'I don't care if this takes down the . D.A.,' the relative told the News Journal. 'It's heartbreaking that (the . girl) carried this all by herself and didn’t tell us.' The . revelations have also sparked a feud between Levy and Putnam County . Sheriff Donald B. Smith, who has accused the D.A. of using his position . to mislead the public. 'In my view, Mr. Levy’s comments and actions would seem to suggest that, if he could have his own way, Mr. Hossu would never have been brought to justice for his crime and Mr Levy’s relationship with him would have never been brought to the light of public scrutiny,' Smith said in a statement. Levy in turn has lambasted the sheriff for claiming Hossu lived at his home. The sheriff has countered that the address on Hossu's driving license is the same as Levy's home. Levy offered two further addresses as . Hossu’s residence, which are both in Clocktower Commons, which is used for office space. One address was also used for a senator's political campaign. Levy has argued that he had 'absolutely no idea whatsoever' of Hossu's immigration status, and that an investigation with show that Hossu had a valid driver's license and Social Security number. Home: Hossu reportedly lived at Levy's million-dollar home, pictured, in Brewster. But Levy has denied knowing he was an illegal immigrant even though others said it was well known . He has asked a neighbouring county to handle the rape case because he knows the suspect. Hossu is being held in Putnam County jail in Carmel on $50,000 cash or $100,000 bond, and he is due in court on April 2. The charges will no doubt come as an embarrassment for Levy's family, including his television personality mother, Judge Judy Sheindlin. Sheindlin, 70, makes $123,000 per day for a $45 million annual salary, SFGate reported. Forbes listed her net worth at $110 million in 2012.","Adam Levy serves as District Attorney for Putnam County, New York .

Traditionally . shoppers were able to barge into stores early the morning after turkey . day but this year stores such as Kmart which will be open from 6am today . and open for 41 hours straight in 'the triple doorbuster' sale to . appease bargain hunters. Other stores including Best Buy and Walmart will be open from 6pm on Thanksgiving while Target, Macy's and Sears will open at 8pm. The early bird: Stores set to open on Thanksgiving, dubbed 'Gray . Thursday.' Pictured are eager shoppers Jonas Allooh (right) who set up camp . on Monday last week with Tony Avitar (left) for the Best Buy Black . Friday sale in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio . Some consumers criticized retailers for opening so early on the holiday but Kmart said it had made the decision in response to customer feedback. According to ABC, the company said in a statement: 'We understand many associates want to spend time with their families during the holiday. Bargains include: . 'With . this in mind Kmart stores do their very best to staff with seasonal . associates and those who are needed to work holidays. All associates who . work on Thanksgiving are compensated with holiday pay.' Some customers took to social media, calling Kmart's decision 'heartless' and 'greedy'. Tents started to pop up in front of some stores up to ten days before the sales to be first through the doors. Identical . triplet brothers in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio were the first to get in line . for Black Friday sales when they set up a camp outside the local Best . Buy Monday afternoon, a full ten days before Thanksgiving. Jonas . Allooh and his two brothers have been camping out for Black Friday . deals for the past four years, but were tired of always being second in . line. This year, they made it a point to get out earlier to be the . first. Tradition: Mr Allooh has been camping out for Best Buy Black Friday sales for the past four years . Urban camping: Mr Allooh and his group take shifts waiting in line, so that everyone can get a shower in. But waiting in line is hardly boring, since they've got all the comforts of home in their 10-person tent . And . the Allooh brothers aren't the only ones. Already, another local has . struck up a tent next to them and others across the country are setting . up tents outside of other Best Buy locations in hopes of saving on . Christmas presents. How much is uncertain, as Best Buy hasn't even . published its Black Friday flyer yet. 'I have plenty of time to look at the flyer,' Mr Allooh told USA Today. For . the next week, Allooh and his brothers will take shifts in the tent so . someone is there at all times, and they all have time to get showers in. Waiting in line is hardly a hardship though, since they have all the comforts of home. Inside their 10-person tent they've got a queen-sized mattress, microwave, TV, computer and five space heaters. Napping allowed: No one will be sleep deprived, thanks to the five heaters that keep the tent warm and the cozy queen-sized mattress . Entertainment: It's never a dull moment for Allooh and his friends, since they've got a TV and computer to keep them entertained in the tent . Mr Allooh is able to take the time to wait in line since he's unemployed. He recently graduated from Kent State University with a doctorate in audiology. While Mr Allooh is hoping to get a computer monitor for himself, and a present for his mom, saving money is just part of the reason he's been camping out the last four years. He genuinely enjoys the experience and left his tent last year right before doors opened to do his shopping online at home. Shortly after putting up his tent, the man who's usually in line pitched up next door. Tony Avitar has been camping out for Black Friday even longer than Mr Allooh. He started seven years ago, before people got the 'bright idea' to bring tents. Pro: Mr Avitar has been camping out for the past seven years, and remembers one particularly bad year where there was freezing rain for sixteen hours and he only had a sleeping bag . He remembers the second year he camped out, he slept in a sleeping bag on the sidewalk during sixteen hours of freezing rain. 'I wanted to stop three or four years ago, and my kids mae me do it because they like coming down,' Mr Avitar told Fox 8. 'We usually have Thanksgiving brought to the tent, so we'll have a full spread in the tent, and it's kind of my time with them.' Also a little annoyed that he wasn't the official first person in line is Robert Prine, who set up his camp outside of a Best Buy Wednesday afternoon in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Mr Prine decided to wait in line in order to get away from it all before the start of the hectic holiday season. 'I wanted a vacation from everybody and everything so I decided Black Friday was the perfect vacation for me,' he told WITN. Loner: Robert Prine decided to camp out for Black Friday this year as a way to get a vacation away from 'everybody and everything' But he too enjoys the sense of community created by the Black Friday camps . 'How often in America do you get to sit down with your neighbors and your friends, and camp out and be good neighbors and look out for one another?' he said. Victoria Torres set up her camp outside a Best Buy in Beaumont, California last Monday but waits in line more out of practicality. 'When we need something and we can't afford it, we comeout on Black Friday because they've got the good deals,' Ms Torres said. 'It gets a little cold, but it's worth it.'","Kmart will be open from 6am for 41 hours straight on 'Gray Thursday'

For months, astronomers have been following a comet that's zooming towards a blisteringly close encounter with the sun. But only today at 18.35 GMT will they know if ISON will survive its closest approach to our star, when it fights the sun's fierce heat and gravitational pull, which could destroy it. If ISON, which has been branded the 'comet of the century' does survive, scientists expect it to put on its best and brightest show yet during December, when it will appear low in the sky at dawn in the UK. Scroll down for video . In this frame grab taken from enhanced video made by Nasa's STEREO-A spacecraft, comet ISON, left, approaches the sun on November 25. ISON, which was discovered a year ago, is making its first spin around the sun and will come the closest to the super-hot solar surface today . Here, Comet ISON enters the field of view of the ESA and Nasa's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory on November 27. In this picture, called a coronagraph, the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible. The comet is seen in the lower right and a giant cloud of solar material, called a coronal mass ejection is seen billowing out under the sun . Some scientists fear the delicate comet has already started to disintegrate, even before it grazes the 'surface' of the sun, 1.2 million kilometres away. Dr Dan Brown, an expert in astronomy at Nottingham Trent University, told MailOnline that when the comet enters the sun's hottest outer layers it will be exposed to a temperature of several million degrees. It is now thought to measure less than a mile (1.6 . kilometres) wide and could fry and shatter, as a victim of the sun's . incredible power. Professor Tim O'Brien, associate director of Joderell Bank Observatory, told the BBC: 'It's like throwing a snowball into fire. It's going to be tough for it to survive. 'But luckily, it's a big object and it moves fast, so it won't spend too much time close to the Sun. There is a lot of uncertainty.' Professor Mark Bailey, from Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland, said: 'It's going to be exposed to the worst that the Sun can throw at it. Comet ISON was discovered by two amateur Russian astronomers in 2012 and will come within 730,000 miles of the Sun today . Appearance: Comet ISON entered the view of NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Nov. 21, 2013, where it can be seen with Earth, Mercury and comet 2P/Encke . 'It will be getting exposed to more and more intense solar heat, and that will start to sublimate the ices (turning them into gas) at an increasing rate.' But if the comet does survive as astronomers hope, it is set to put on an incredible show and appear at its brightest yet. The heat from the Sun will excite the dust and gas in the comet's core, allowing it to blaze a trail, where it will appear low in the skies at dawn in the UK during December. Dr Brown said: 'Astronomers around the world are hoping that ISON will become an amazing sight for the naked eye in the first half of December. People at home can also capture a glimpse if it survives. 'Just look out for it half an hour before sunrise from December 1 onwards. It will be visible low in the east south-eastern horizon.' Earlier this week, NASA has released a high resolution image of the streaking comet that look like a swimming tadpole. It was captured by the H-1 camera on board NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on November 21. Nasa said ISON, which is officially labelled as Comet C/2012 S1, appeared to still be intact in its video and can be seen in these images along with Earth, Mercury and Comet 2P/Encke. The tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles – called the solar wind – that flows out from the sun. A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths . Should . it survive, ISON, pronounced EYE'-sahn, will be visible with the naked . eye through December, at least from the Northern Hemisphere. Discernible at times in November with ordinary binoculars and . occasionally even just the naked eye, it already has dazzled observers . and is considered the most scrutinised comet ever by NASA. But the best . is, potentially, yet to come. Dr Brown told MailOnline: 'This close encounter with the sun offers a unique opportunity for astronomers to analyse the composition of a comet. Comets are icy, dusty snowballs - the remains from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago. 'The long tail containing the material frozen in the comet and released through the heat of the sun offers astronomers the chance to identify different elements. 'It has already been bright enough for astronomers to capture amazing pictures. However, if the comet survives its burning close encounter with the sun it may have a huge and impressively long tail with a brightness that might make it an easy to spot object even with the naked eye. 'This happened in 1965 with the comet Ikeya Seki that had an enormously long tail; but some comets, like Lovejoy three years ago, have been ripped apart during their close encounter by the sun's gravitational force. 'The magic limit for survival of the comet seems to be the size, which has to exceed 2 km so it does not get boiled away or ripped apart by the sun. ISON is estimated to be that size, so we should all cross our fingers and await our early Christmas comet,' he said. Ison, which has been dubbed the 'comet of the century',has been visible to the naked eye this month. German amateur astronomer Waldemar Skorupa recorded this image from Kahler Asten, in Germany, on November 16 . Detected just over a year ago, the . comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time. Still fresh, this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the . beginning of our solar system. It's . believed to be straight from the Oort cloud on the fringes of the solar . system, which is home to countless icy bodies - most notably the frozen balls of . dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets. For . whatever reason, ISON was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward . the heart of the solar system by the sun's intense gravitational pull. The closer the comet gets to the sun, the faster it gets and in January, it was clocked at 40,000 mph (64,000 kph). By last Thursday, the comet had accelerated to 150,000 mph (240,000 kph) but by the time ISON slingshots around the sun, it will be moving at a mind-boggling 828,000 mph (1,332,000 kph). The place to see the ‘comet of the century’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed, such as in the countryside. It can be seen with the naked eye, but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail, streamers and bumps in the surface. It should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky. Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface today at 18:35 GMT. Whether it survives or is torn apart, humans have nothing to fear. The comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles (64 million kilometres), less than half the distance between Earth and the sun. The closest approach to Earth will occur on Boxing day - if the comet survives. Then it will head away in the opposite direction forever, given its anticipated trajectory. ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012, but it officially is known as C/2012 S1, which indicates when it was discovered. Take heart: The 'C' means it is not expected here again. The comet, top right, has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout December and January. It could be the brightest for 100 years . The comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail .","At 18:35 GMT today astronomers will know if comet ISON has survived its closest approach to the sun .

The song, complete with a video of a burglar being apprehended by Yorkshire police, was released on YouTube exactly 12 days before Christmas. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

The newspaper interviewed several of the attendees - whose crimes ranged from manslaughter and robbery to identity theft. Arthur Castillo, 38, who was convicted of assault and possessing stolen property, said: 'Cops won’t leave us alone. Newly released prisoners are watched by the police and a lot of us . don’t feel we have an opportunity to readapt to normal life because we . are treated as criminals even though we are free.'

The long-awaited report into how Britain went to war in Iraq has been delayed indefinitely by a row over new transcripts of conversations between Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and George W. Bush. Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot has revealed that he has asked for ‘more than 130 records of conversations’ between the three men to be declassified. His demands have been blocked by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Britain’s most senior civil servant. Long-awaited: Iraq inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot has revealed that his request for 'more than 130 records of conversations' between Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and George Bush to be released has been blocked . In a letter released on the inquiry website, Sir John says the snarl-up has led him to delay the ‘Maxwellisation process’, which requires him to inform senior politicians and civil servants if he plans to criticise them in his final report. MPs last night voiced fears that the inquiry may never conclude and that it is ‘beyond a joke’ to let the costs to taxpayers spiral further than the £7.4million it has already cost. The Chilcot Inquiry was established by Mr Brown when he was prime minister. But senior civil servants are blocking the  publication of private communications between the two Labour premiers and  the former US president on the ground that it might prejudice future relations between leaders. The descision by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Britain's most senior civil servant, has spurred fears that the Chilcot Inquiry will never report . The hold-up also involves whether to make public ‘25 notes from Mr Blair to President Bush’ and ‘some 200 Cabinet-level discussions’, Sir John said. In his letter, Sir John said he and his colleagues ‘have agreed that the inquiry should not issue those provisional criticisms without a clear understanding of what supporting evidence will be agreed for publication. ‘The inquiry has therefore contacted the relevant individuals to notify them that the Maxwellisation timetable has been delayed and that we are not yet able to confirm when we will be in a position to provide them with the material they expect.’ In a letter of reply to Sir John, David Cameron said he was ‘aware of the scale of the task declassification has presented to a number of government departments’. He added: ‘I appreciate consideration of the disclosure requests for the remaining sensitive categories of information must be handled sensitively and carefully but I hope that consideration of the final sets of papers can be concluded as soon as possible.’ A senior Tory MP, who has taken a close interest in the Chilcot Inquiry, said: ‘You do wonder whether the Chilcot Inquiry will ever report. ‘It gets to the point where you wonder if there will be any point publishing the conclusions.’ Elfyn Llwyd, Plaid Cymru leader in  the Commons, said it was ‘absolutely unacceptable’ for the documents not to be published. He said: ‘This is preposterous now – it has got beyond a joke. 'It would be in everyone’s best interests for all the available evidence to see the light of day so the inquiry can come to a measured and proper conclusion on all the available relevant evidence.’ Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Blair was prepared to comment, but allies of Mr Brown said he had no objection to the publication of the documents. Increasing numbers of people – especially the young – believe our political system is a closed circle: secretive, impenetrable and corrupt. If you want to know why so many feel alienated, just take a look at a story that speaks volumes about the unaccountability of our political masters. Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry into Britain’s participation in the invasion of Iraq, it turns out, has ground to a halt. Handshake: George Bush and Tony Blair after a meeting in 2001. The fallout from the Iraq war is leading increasing numbers of people to elieve our political system is a closed circle: secretive, impenetrable and corrupt . The inquiry wants to release the details of some 25 notes that Tony Blair, who was prime minister during the 2003 invasion, sent to the then US president George W. Bush. He also wants to publish 130 conversations that Blair and his successor, Gordon Brown, had with the American president, as well as information relating to 200 Cabinet discussions about the invasion and its aftermath. Quite understandable, you might think. For such an inquiry must shed light on these murky matters. Why bother having one at all if you are going to suppress vital information? But the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, has dug in his heels and is refusing to release the documents. As a result, even though Chilcot and his team have seen them, and have drawn on them when writing their report, you and I are barred from reading them. Thus there is no way for us to weigh up Chilcot’s conclusions, which means that whatever he may decide, the origins of the Iraq War will probably remain as controversial as ever. Alas, none of this is very surprising. Whitehall has long been engulfed in a culture of secrecy, and the lamentable urge to block, obfuscate and cover up is deeply engrained in our political culture. At one level, all this merely  confirms the general pointlessness of public inquiries. Gordon Brown set the Chilcot Inquiry in June 2009 it up, he promised it would take about a year. We are still no nearer to discovering the truth . The Chilcot operation is in fact the third inquiry into the Iraq imbroglio, following the Hutton and Butler whitewashes. As usual with inquiries of this kind, it has ballooned into a grotesque and vastly expensive circus, and is unlikely to shed any new light or to change anybody’s opinion. When Gordon Brown set it up, he promised it would take about a year. That was in June 2009. We are now in November 2013, and still we are no nearer to discovering the truth. As for the costs, they have so far come to a whopping £7,474,400 – with plenty more to come. The astonishing thing is that, by the standards of public inquiries, Chilcot has not proved especially expensive. The Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday took 12 years and cost a staggering £200million. It would have been cheaper just to apologise and give the bereaved families £10million each. But no: the Government thought it was better to give the money to the legal profession instead. Yet there is something particularly galling about the Chilcot impasse, because the invasion of Iraq left a permanent stain on our political culture. Although it is now more than ten years since Tony Blair sent in  British troops, the scars of the conflict have yet to heal. Iraq itself is still cursed by regular car bombings, while 179 British families are still mourning their fallen sons and daughters. A decade on, it is clear that the decision to invade was a defining moment, not merely for Mr Blair’s premiership, but for a generation’s attitude to politics. Quite apart from its other costs, it fundamentally altered the way many people thought about the political  process, and not for the better. While some two million people marched against the war, many more were profoundly disturbed by the suspicion that our government had lied and dissembled in order to please the Americans. For young people in particular, the controversy seemed to confirm that politics was inherently corrupt. In this context, the ludicrous farce of the Chilcot Inquiry is even more damaging. To many people, it will inevitably appear that the Whitehall establishment is protecting its own. My own suspicion is that these messages that the Cabinet Secretary won’t make public will probably turn out to be less exciting than we think. Much as we love to believe in stunning revelations and smoking guns, the reality is usually muddier and more mundane. But as the popularity of conspiracy theories suggests, people always like to believe the worst. What, they will wonder, do Blair and Brown have to hide? What did they tell President Bush? What promises did they make, and what secrets are lurking in the documents? The great irony, of course, is that the Chilcot Inquiry was meant to shed light on the dark corners of British foreign policy, to heal the wounds of the Iraq invasion, and to restore public faith in the political process. Yet all of this is so unnecessary. For decades, successive governments have come to power promising to roll back the culture of secrecy, yet none of them has done it. Why the mandarins and their political patrons are so frightened of openness is simply beyond me. Their American friends, for example, are much quicker and keener to open their archives and to air their dirty linen in public, and it never does them any harm. Truth and openness are the building blocks of any successful democratic society. The more you hide, the more people suspect and fear you – and the more you play into the hands of juvenile nihilists who prattle about revolution without really understanding what it means. It was President Richard Nixon, of all people, who put it best. ‘What really hurts in matters of this sort,’ he told an aide during the Watergate scandal, ‘is not the fact that they occur... What really hurts is if you try to cover it up.’ Alas for Nixon, he did not take his own advice. But our politicians really ought to learn the appropriate lesson.",MPs last night voiced fears that the Chilcot Inquiry may never conclude .

Immigration minister Mark Harper sought to allay fears about the scale of the influx from Bulgaria and Romania in the New Year . Britain will not face a flood of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when border controls lapse in the New Year, the immigration minister insisted last night. Mark Harper played down fears of a mass influx from the Eastern European countries and ruled out extending the restrictions on migrant workers. Ministers have come under pressure from Tory backbenchers to defy the EU and protect British jobs by keeping controls in place. Currently, Romanians and Bulgarians can only work in the UK on seasonal fruit-picking visas or if they are self-employed. From January, they will have the same working rights as Britons. Mr Harper said extending the restrictions from when they expire on New Year’s Eve was ‘not legally possible’ because it would be overturned in court. However, he insisted he was ‘not complacent’ about potential problems and pointed to measures to limit migrants’ access to social housing and benefits. ‘You won’t see people just being able to turn up and get access to social housing five minutes after they arrive, which is one of the things that drives people up the wall,’ he said at a press conference. He rejected comparisons between next year’s changes and 2004, when Labour opened up the borders to eight Eastern European countries, including Poland. Officials predicted that just 13,000 migrants would come to Britain every year, but more than a million have arrived. Controls: Border Agency officials evict Romanian migrants. In 2007, when the country joined the EU, 'transitional controls' were applied which meant migrants must have a job offer in order to cross the border . Mr Harper said there was a ‘big . difference’ between now and 2004 because eight other EU countries will . also be forced to drop restrictions on January 1. He said migrants would . be lured to Germany by jobs and to other countries with larger Romanian . and Bulgarian populations. ‘In 2004, we were the only major . country not to have transitional controls,’ he said. ‘All the other big . countries did, so anyone that wanted to come to work somewhere legally . came to the United Kingdom which is why we had such a significant number . of people.’ Last week, former Home Secretary Jack Straw said dropping border controls in 2004 was a ‘spectacular mistake’. Concerns over the likely scale of . immigration from the two countries, which have a combined population of . 29million, prompted Tory backbenchers this week to demand controls be . extended. Nigel Mills, the MP for Amber Valley, proposed extending them . until the end of 2018. But Mr Harper said this would be a breach of EU treaties signed by the last Labour government. He said: ‘It simply isn’t legally . possible. The accession treaties only give us the ability – and the . other eight counties with transitional controls – to extend them to the . end of the year. We’ve extended the controls to their legal maximum.’ Mr Harper refused to make an official . prediction of how many Romanians and Bulgarians would arrive from . January, claiming to do so would be a ‘fool’s errand’. Migration campaigners have predicted . 50,000 a year will arrive, blowing a hole in the Government’s pledge to . cut net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ by 2015.","Mark Harper seeks to allay fears about influx of new workers from January .

The New Jersey man accused of murdering his pageant-queen ex-girlfriend is now facing additional charges of aggravated sexual assault for her rape. Mary Greff, 23, was discovered strangled to death in her parent's Waldwick, New Jersey home last month. Her ex-boyfriend, 22-year-old Mark Spatucci, is accused of entering the home through the second-floor window and killing her when an argument turned nasty, all while their infant son slept in a crib in the same room. But prosecutors added additional charges today after an autopsy revealed that Greff had been raped before being killed. In Bergen County court this morning, Spatucci plead not guilty to two counts of sexual assault and one count of felony murder. Horrific: Mary Greff, 23, (left) was found dead in her parents' home last month and her ex-boyfriend, 22-year-old Mark Spatucci (right), was charged with her murder. In court this morning, additional charges of sexual assault were lodged against Spatucci after an autopsy revealed that Greff had been raped before her death . Witness: The whole incident took place in front of the couple's eight-month-old child . Spatucci is currently being held on $2 million bond and is scheduled to appear in court on Friday morning. Greff's parents were believed to be asleep in another part of the house during the tragic incident. The 23-year-old woman was a competitor in Miss New Jersey Teen USA in 2008. Prosecutors said Greff and Spatucci began dating two years ago, that she gave birth in February and that the two had lived together for a short time before she split from him and moved in with her parents. Regret? Spatucci kept his head down as he appeared in court late last month . Troubled: Prosecutors said Greff and Spatucci began dating two years ago, that she gave birth in February and that the two had lived together for a short time before she split from him and moved in with her parents . Investigators believe Spatucci drove to the Greff residence late Tuesday and entered, undetected, through a second-floor window. Once inside Greff's bedroom, prosecutors say an argument became violent and Spatucci killed her, leaving the body on the bed. Her father found her dead early Wednesday, police said. WABC reported that Greff's parents left the home to run some errands in the morning and then got back to make a horrific discovery. 'They left in the morning, and it wasn't until they returned when they realized that they had not heard from their daughter,' Bergen County Prosecutor James Molinelli said. Sad: The 23-year-old woman was a competitor in Miss New Jersey Teen USA in 2008 . 'So that's when the father went upstairs and found the body,' Molinelli added. Prosecutors said Spatucci had court-ordered custody visitation with the infant but Greff had full custody. Spatucci was located late Wednesday in Midland Park and taken into custody for questioning. He was charged Thursday with murder, felony murder, burglary, endangering the welfare of a child and hindering apprehension. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.","Mary Greff, 23, who competed in Miss New Jersey Teen USA in 2008, was found murdered at parents' home on October 23 .

When animal welfare workers found two six-month-old pit-bull-cross pups roaming the streets of Philadelphia they quickly realized there was no splitting the two up. Jermaine acts as a guidedog for his blind brother Jeffrey, patiently leading him and making sure to maintain physical contact with his blind brother. Their carers were able to snap this sweet picture of the two dogs cuddled up together fast asleep that shows the bond between the litter-mates. Scroll down for video . Love is blind: These two brothers have formed a close bond, with Jermaine leading his blind brother Jeffrey and making sure he's always close by . Now eight months old, the dogs are in the care of Operation Ava, a no-kill animal shelter that seeks to find forever homes for abandoned animals. Believed to be labrador-pit bull mixes, the two are seeking a home, and their carers are keen for them to stay together. 'They're always pretty much touching each other,' Ray Little, director of lifesaving at Operation Ava, told NBC Philadelphia. 'Jeffrey really does try to maintain contact with Jermaine, especially when he's in an unfamiliar environment. As soon as he gets familiar with a new place, then he becomes a little bit more independent. But it's amazing how they try to maintain contact with each other.' Orphans: The pups were six months old when they were found roaming the streets of Philadelphia together . Since the Chester County SPCA posted the picture of the sleeping brothers embracing, it's been shared more than 67,000 times. The response has been overwhelming, but Little says people who have serious intentions of adopting the dogs need to physically go to the shelter. 'It's always best for potential adopters to meet the dogs. We have only received two applications and we're still waiting to hear from references,' he told NBC Philadelphia. Inseparable: The cute pair do everything together and their carers hope they'll soon find a new home . The pups are described being social and good with children. They're currently about 35lbs but Operation Ava staff estimate they'll eventually grow to about 50lbs each. Apart from his eye condition, which vets believe to be congenital, Jeffrey and his devoted guide brother Jermaine are completely healthy.

A catering company makes a staggering 500 mile round trip every day of the school year to deliver lunches to pupils, it has been revealed. Meals for more than 100 schools in Dorset are prepared 230 miles away in Nottingham before they're transported in refrigerated lorries across the country - a journey that takes up to four hours. Parents have branded the trip 'ludicrous' as it emerged the vehicles clock up a staggering 1,000 miles per week transporting food. 'Ludicrous': The meals for Dorset are produced in Nottingham and driven 230 miles to various schools. Each trip costs at least £80 in fuel it has been estimated. The council said the deal was 'value for money' The company, Cygnet Catering, supplies 118 schools in Dorset with 5,140 meals a day at a cost of up to £2.02 per lunch, which it says includes fuel and transportation costs. It costs an average small car more than £80 in petrol to do one return journey between Nottingham and Dorset. Over five days this amounts to more than £400 or £12,000 per school year. In a large refrigerated lorry the cost is likely to be considerably more. Parent groups have have raised concerns about how fresh the food is when t arrives in schools as well as the carbon footprint caused by the lengthy journeys. Margaret Morrissey, spokeswomen for campaign group Parents Outloud, said: 'It takes at least four hours to do this journey, that’s a long way for food to travel. 'It just seems ludicrous when there are Dorset companies who are able to make excellent school meals that are locally sourced and home cooked. Long journey: The meals, provided by Cygnet Catering (pictured here in . Nottingham) have to travel hundreds of miles in refrigerated lorries before they arrive on children's plates. Meals include lasagne and fish fingers . 'I’m not saying this company is not a good one, but a huge amount of fuel is being used and it makes you wonder if the food can be as fresh as if it were prepared locally. 'It’s so important children get a decent, nutritious meal at lunchtime. 'I think parents will think this is ridiculous and I think we need to be asking questions about why we in Dorset, as a rural farming county, are not using local companies.' Dorset County Council signed a £1.2million a year contract with Cygnet Catering based in Beeston, Nottingham, in 2007, because it was a ‘value for money service’. The factory prepare the meals on site and it is thought they are then chilled so they can be reheated at schools in areas including Weymouth, Portland, Poole and Bournemouth. Meals include southern fried chicken pizza, fish fingers, sausage and mash and lasagne. Some schools have chosen to opt out of the service and are paying an extra eight pence per meal to have it sourced and cooked locally. One school is Holy Trinity, a Church of England primary school in Weymouth, which has meals delivered from a nearby college for £2.10 each. Opt out: Holy Trinity, a Church of England primary school in Weymouth, has decided to provide its own locally-sourced meals at a cost of 8p extra . Helen Toft, a governor at the school, said: 'For some children the meal they get at lunchtime is the best they will get all day. 'That . is a sad fact, and makes it our responsibility to see that what they . get in the best we can achieve, and that means good, local food.' Toni . Coombs, cabinet member for education at Dorset County Council, said: . 'To provide a great value for money service we used a tendering process . for the contract. 'Cygnet Catering were awarded the contract in 2007 because there was not the capacity locally. 'We did have reservations about the distance the food was being transported. 'Also, Local Food Links, a food supplier based in Bridport, has supplied a number of schools with locally sourced meals.' Mrs Coombs said the contract with Cygnet is due to run out next July and the council will look to find a more local supplier.

Yegna, a five-strong group, have launched a radio show and released a string of videos that aim to empower women in the African country. But even Ethiopian critics of the project say the money is being wasted because the show reaches only a quarter of the population. The British aid-funded girl band: 'Yegna' dubbed the Ethiopian 'Spice Girls' are funded by the Department for International development in collaboration with the Nike Foundation . In Britain, the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the £10billion aid budget should not be squandered in this way. Ethiopia has become one of the biggest recipients of British funds, despite being an autocratic one-party state. The new Yegna ‘entertainment brand’, established in April, is part of a £30million scheme called Girl Hub that also operates in Nigeria and Rwanda. Like the original Spice Girls, the band members each have a nickname. Teref Kassahun, 26, plays the spoiled brat, Lemlem Hailemicheal, 26, a tomboy known as the defender, Zebiba Girma, 22, the mysterious character, Eyerusalem Kelemework, 27, is the genius and Rahel Getu, 22, the dependable one. Lyrics to one of their songs, This House, included: ‘Women are sisters, women are mothers, women are wives. Let’s respect them. Tell that guy to respect girls and we will respect him.’ Yegna is behind a twice-weekly radio drama and talk show for adolescent girls. They have been given £3.8million by the Department for International Development and £800,000 by the Nike Foundation. Nicknames: Sara (left) is described as 'the smartest girl in class' and 'always getting the highest grades' while Mimi is 'tough but caring' A DfID spokesman said girls in Ethiopia faced challenges such as forced marriage, violence, teen pregnancy and dropping out of school. ‘Yegna addresses these issues using role models to champion the potential of Ethiopian girls in ways which are accessible and relevant,’ said the spokesman. But the Yegna radio broadcasts on Sheger FM in Addis Ababa and on other radio stations in the Amhara region, reach only 20million of the country’s 80million people. Last year the Girl Hub project was condemned by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact. Its report warned of serious deficiencies in governance and told of an unacceptable lack of child protection policies. Girl Hub has also been accused of ‘poor budgeting and financial monitoring’. Baby? Melat (left) is 'cute, hip and fun and a Yegnaís princess' and Lemlem's character is described as 'patient, caring and kind' Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers are fed up of their hard-earned cash being spent on projects that don’t deliver meaningful aid to recipients. ‘It’s time to reassess DfID spending and focus money on things like disaster relief, so that taxpayers and recipients get a good deal.’ Tory MP Philip Davies described Girl Hub as ‘a complete waste of money’. ‘It can only reinforce the view that DfID have got far too much money,’ he said. ‘They have got so much that they are struggling to find ways to spend it and you end up with projects like this.’ A source told the Mail that Yegna had proved lucrative for the five young women: ‘They came from poor backgrounds, three of them worked for a theatre company. Now they are rich in comparison.’ Overseers of the three-year project allegedly spent £16,000 of the funding on having a famous singing star in one of the girls’ music videos. DfID has denied this claim. Idol: Emuye is Yegnaís queen and the 'girl we'd all love to be' Slammed: The group have been criticised in Ethiopia for being a waste of money . The managing director of an Ethiopian media company working to empower women said he could run his project for 154 years at the same cost as the Yegna initiative. Moges Tafesse, from Synergy Habesha, said: ‘To me, the project does seem very expensive.’ Mr Tafesse said his show, Finote Heawan, will be broadcast on FM97 – a government-owned radio station the entire country can listen to. A media commentator, who did not want to be named, said: ‘Putting on the radio show is nonsense. This kind of empowering women has to be aimed at the people in the countryside – it is those girls who are abandoned. Those girls who are in the city with access to the show have got their education and know about their rights.’ Lemlem told the Mail: ‘It is definitely worth the cost – it is an amazing issue. It means a lot to Ethiopia and we are using the money effectively. It is a big change. ‘We are like the Spice Girls except our music is not just for entertaining – it is educational.’ Similarities? The group are supposed to 'empower women', following in the footsteps of the Spice Girls .","Yegna are a five-strong group that aim to empower women .

Militant union bosses last night warned their members not to ‘collaborate’ with a government inquiry into the use of bully-boy tactics in industrial disputes. David Cameron ordered the probe into Unite’s tactic of sending mobs of demonstrators to protest outside the homes of company directors. But senior Liberal Democrats voiced concerns, saying they would not allow the review – which they insist will also examine tactics used by some companies – to become an exercise in ‘union bashing’. Unite’s political director Jennie Formby described the probe as ‘nothing more than a Tory election stunt which no trade unionist will collaborate with’. Her comments suggest that members who assist the inquiry will be seen as collaborators – a loaded term often used to describe those who helped the Nazis during the war. The TUC also dismissed the inquiry as ‘politically driven’. Sarah Veale, head of employment rights at the union, said: ‘It is a completely disproportionate response to one or two instances. ‘It is really quite disgraceful that the Government is pretending that there is a real public interest concern here.’ The inquiry was launched after the Daily Mail revealed the true nature of the so-called ‘leverage tactics’ used by Unite during the bitter dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland. Unite targeted the directors of the plant’s owner Ineos, staging a demonstration with a giant inflatable rat outside one executive’s home. One director said he had feared for the safety of his wife and his two young children after 30 Unite protesters descended on his drive in the school holidays. Dispute: Unite's political director Jennie Formby has blasted the review as a 'Tory election stunt' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has always denied any intimidation or bullying on the part of the union. But Mr Cameron said a review was needed to examine whether the law needs tightening to prevent intimidation. Unsure: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said he would not back a clampdown . Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said it was right to investigate ‘quite unpleasant examples of intimidation against fellow workers and against management’. ‘First of all we need to examine the facts and then to see whether the law needs changing,’ he said. The review by Bruce Carr QC, a leading industrial relations lawyer, will investigate the issue of ‘leverage’ tactics, as well as the impact of such disputes on the critical national infrastructure. Mr Carr will head a three-strong panel, with a representative each from employers and unions. He is expected to report back in six months. A source close to Vince Cable said the Lib Dem Business Secretary had insisted the review also examine ‘inappropriate behaviour’ by some companies, including blacklisting suspected troublemakers. Nick Clegg also insisted the review would look at ‘irresponsible behaviour by the unions and by business.’ But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander was explicit that the Lib Dems would not back a clampdown on unions. He said: ‘If there are measured, sensible, prudent reforms that could help to improve the industrial relations landscape yet further, I’d be up for that. What I’m not up for is a bunch of union-bashing.’ However, Tory sources said the ‘main focus’ of the review would be on the activities of the unions. The row over Unite’s behaviour has been acutely embarrassing for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is heavily reliant on the union’s cash to keep Labour afloat. And former Grangemouth employee Stevie Deans is at the centre of a controversy over allegations Unite tried to rig the selection of a new candidate for the safe Labour seat. Meanwhile First Minister Alex Salmond yesterday condemned the review as a ‘foolish and irresponsible’ political manoeuvre. Tactics? A panel will look into groups such as Unite, led by Len McCluskey, and tactics they are accused of using . The Labour Party leadership ‘approved’ Unite’s political activities in Falkirk, according to a leaked report. In a formal response to allegations of vote-rigging in the safe Labour seat, Unite said the party was ‘well aware of Unite’s political strategy activities in Falkirk and approved of it’. The union has been accused of signing up people as Labour members without their knowledge in a bid to rig the selection of a parliamentary candidate. The leaked document reveals that the Labour inquiry made a series of devastating findings against Unite, including there was ‘no doubt that members were recruited in an attempt to manipulate party processes’. Ed Miliband has repeatedly refused to publish the party’s dossier on the affair. Unite denies any wrongdoing.","Jennie Formby, Unite political director, blasted it as a 'Tory election stunt'

Cleaners working on an aircraft in eastern India have found 24 gold bars worth more than £620,000 hidden in a toilet compartment - the latest in a series of smuggling attempts uncovered at the country's airports. The cleaners had boarded the Jet Airways plane at Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) airport on Tuesday after it had travelled from the eastern city of Patna. It had earlier been flying on international routes that included the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Customs officers seized 24 bars of gold at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata . The cleaners' discovery is the latest evidence of a growing smuggler trade which takes advantage of India's customs laws . Smugglers have been using a loophole in India's flight schedules to attempt getting gold into the country without having to declare it to customs officials. The gold is secretly stashed in an aircraft toilet at its international point of departure, where it remains when the plane lands at an Indian city. Because that particular aircraft is then used to continue on as a domestic flight, a new passenger picks up the gold on the domestic leg and leaves the plane when it lands, knowing that there will be no customs checks. India, which rivals China as the world's biggest gold consumer, has seen a rise in smuggling after import duties were increased three times this year to try to dampen demand for the precious metal. Just last month an aircraft cleaning crew found 280 gold bars worth £1.17 million inside a plane's toilet after it flew from Dubai to the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka.

Custom officials and police were aware . that the gold had been hidden on the jet, operated by discount airline . Flydubai, and the smuggler panicked and left the bars in the toilet. Earlier in the year, police in Bangladesh said, there had been 'scores' of discoveries of gold on planes after couriers had decided the smuggling operation might have been discovered. Chennai Airport was also the scene of drama last month when 32kg of gold bars were found hidden in the toilet of a plane that had started out in Dubai. And when yet more abandoned gold was found on a plane that had set out from Dubai, landed in Mumbai then continued on to Goa, an Indian intelligence official explained how the system was being operated. 'In the case of the Dubai-Mumbai-Goa flight, a carrier boarded in Dubai and mid-air concealed the gold in the toilet behind the closet. 'The plan was for another passenger to board the flight in Mumbai, remove the gold mid-air and clear it at Goa without customs examination because by then it was a domestic sector. 'These smugglers travel business class since the number of passengers is less and the toilet is mostly unusued. They get down at Mumbai, leaving the goods behind. 'Another passenger then books a business class Mumbai-Goa ticket and takes out the goods mid-air and clears it in the domestic sector without customs examination.'","Jet Airways plane had been flying on international routes before landing at Kolkata .

All across the globe people are waiting longer to say ‘I do’ according to a new map that shows the average age for marriages in every country. People wait the longest in Western Europe, where the average age is over 30. In Afghanistan, one of the youngest, they tend to do it at 20. And while getting married remains the most common lifestyle choice worldwide, every single country is seeing people bite the bullet later than ever. Waiting for it: This map shows the average age people the world over tend to marry and that age is trending upward everywhere . The numbers come from 2012 United Nations data, which the site Priceonomics used to assemble the map. Across the globe, the biggest factor in the age countries tend to marry is economic. The richer the nation, the longer people wait. Which explains how common it is for Western Europeans and Scandinavians to wait until after 30. And why in Afghanistan, where living standards are among the world’s lowest, people marry a decade younger. Gender differences: While everyone is getting married at an older age, men in every country surveyed by the United Nations in 2012 marry at an older average age than their female counterparts . A Pew Research Center 2011 study put the average age for American women to marry at 26.9. The age for men was 29.8. While . the difference between men and women seems minimal, averaging masks a . the fact that men tend to marry much older than men worldwide. According to Priceonomics, women continue to marry much older men in developing countries. In 39 of the studied countries, 20 percent of women marry by the age of 18. And in twenty countries, 10 percent of females are married by the age of 15. Men, on the other hand, are married by 18 in only 2 percent of countries surveyed. Income gap: Young Palestinian groom Ahmed Soboh, 15 and his bride Tala, 14. Income is the largest factor that determines the age at which a nation's citizens tend to marry. The richer the country, the older the average age . In addition to the age when people married rising worldwide, fewer people are now married—at least in the United States—than ever before. Less than half of adults in America are married compared to 72 percent who were married in 1960. However, that doesn’t mean the unwed intend to stay that way. According to the study, marriage is the preferred lifestyle worldwide. In most of the surveyed countries, 80 percent of both men and women were married before age 50.","Wedding bells ring the latest in life for Scandinavians and Western Europeans, whose average age at the alter is over 30 .

Underwater kites that bear an uncanny resemblance to the Starship Enterprise could soon be supplying power to homes across the world, an American researcher claims. David Olinger of Worcester Polytechnic Institute says underwater currents could produce power comparable to multiple nuclear stations - if engineers can work out how to harness it. His idea is to use large kites with rigid wings underwater. Minesto an energy firm is experimenting with the technology. The tidal energy device developed by Minesto, named Deep Green, converts energy from tidal stream flows into electricity using a kite with a turbine . By flying the kites in a figure of eight pattern, Professor Olinger believes he can harness large amounts of power. The futuristic devices look like the fictional spaceship in Star Trek but could play a part in providing much needed energy to the world's growing population. Professor David Olinger sits on a rig that uses a rocking arm to translate the motion of wind-powered kite into rotary motion to spin an electric generator . 'Unseen under the waves, winding along coastlines and streaming through underwater channels, there are countless ocean currents and tidal flows that bristle with kinetic energy,' he said. 'And just as wind turbines can convert moving air into electricity, there is the potential to transform these virtually untapped liquid 'breezes' into vast amounts of power. 'For example, it has been estimated that the potential power from the Florida Current, which flows from the Gulf of Mexico into the Atlantic Ocean, is 20 gigawatts—equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants.' The project has recently been given a three-year, $300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to explore ways to harness ocean currents and tidal flows. The underwater kites bear some resemblance to the Starship Enterprise, seen here in an illustration for the recent Star Trek film, INTO THE DARKNESS . As water flows over the hydrodynamic wing, a lift force is generated which allows the device to move smoothly through the water and for the turbine to rotate hence generating electricity . The team plan to build a series of kites and test them in ‘water tunnels’. Energy from a tidal stream is converted into electricity using a kite with a turbine. The . kite assembly, consisting of a wing and turbine, is attached by a . tether to a fixed point on the ocean bed. As . water flows over the hydrodynamic wing, a lift force is generated which . allows the device to move smoothly through the water and for the . turbine to rotate hence generating electricity. Dr David Olinger of Worcester Polytechnic Institutesaid: 'It has been estimated that the potential power from the . Florida Current, which flows from the Gulf of Mexico into the Atlantic . Ocean, is 20 gigawatts—equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants.' 'Instead of moving air, you have moving water and the kites have rigid wings,' Olinger said, 'But the same physical principles apply.' One way to generate power with underwater kites is to have an electric generator attached to the kite, which would be tethered to a floating platform. Using computational models, Olinger and his team will virtually test possible designs for undersea kites and explore methods for tethering them to floating platforms similar to those used for oil and gas rigs. In the final stage of the research, they will build scale models of the kites and test them in a water tank at WPI and at the Alden Research Laboratory, a renowned hydraulics research facility where the kites will be'flown' in large water flumes. Another firm, Minesto, is also experimenting with the technology. The tidal energy device developed by Minesto, named Deep Green, converts energy from tidal stream flows into electricity using a kite with a turbine. 'The kite assembly, consisting of a wing and turbine, is attached by a tether to a fixed point on the ocean bed,' the firm says. Professor Olinger's kite is connected by a tether to a platform that floats at the ocean surface and is anchored to the ocean floor with mooring lines. The kite will have a wing, a rudder control surfaces, and ballast tanks. A turbine generator inside the kite would generate power as the kite moved in a figure-eight motion . 'As water flows over the hydrodynamic wing, a lift force is generated which allows the device to move smoothly through the water and for the turbine to rotate hence generating electricity.” The Deep Green ‘underwater kite’ marine power plant is already producing electricity in the waters off Northern Ireland.","David Olinger of Worcester Polytechnic .

Disgraced Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers is alleged to have secretly asked his regular dealer for cocaine just two days after he publicly pledged to seek ‘professional help’ for his drug abuse, The Mail on Sunday has learned. On Tuesday, while in hiding from the media, he contacted drug dealer Peter Wilson – who Flowers gave £300 to in the extraordinary video we published last week. Later in a telephone conversation he allegedly asked for more drugs. The suspended Methodist minister had made a contrite statement through the church last Sunday – apologising for ‘stupid and wrong’ actions in buying crack cocaine and other drugs. Scroll down for video . Despite telling the Mail on Sunday he was seeking help for his addiction, Reverend Paul Flowers contacted his dealer two days later allegedly asking for more drugs . His vow was prompted by our world exclusive story last week. But shocking new evidence shows his appetite is apparently as rapacious as ever. Inviting Wilson, 35, a convicted drug dealer whose name we have changed, to stay with him at his Liverpool ‘safe house’, Flowers said: ‘So .  .  . just er, turn up, and if you want to bring the boy Charlie, that’s fine too.’ Leeds-based Wilson, who taped the call which Mail on Sunday reporters have heard and verified, confirmed that they have no mutual friends called Charlie, and other texts we publish today show it was Flowers’s habitual term for cocaine. ‘I had absolutely no doubt Paul was referring to coke,’ Wilson told The Mail on Sunday last night. ‘He always used that word for it. ‘A bit earlier in the conversation, I asked him if it would be OK to smoke a spliff at the house – which belongs to another Methodist minister friend of his – and Paul said that would be fine as long as I did it in the garden. How the story broke last Sunday . ‘But he only mentioned “Charlie” right at the end of the conversation, trying to make it sound like a casual aside, but we both knew what he was talking about and I certainly don’t know anyone called Charlie.’ Flowers told Wilson he had been using drugs since 2010, which would include nearly all of his spell at the Co-op Bank – and also astonished him by saying he didn’t believe in God. Wilson said: ‘He told me that he has been doing drugs for three years, so how much attention he ever paid to his business at the bank is anyone’s guess. I know how much all these drugs affect your mental powers and concentration.’ He went on: ‘I only found out he was a reverend when I saw his picture online with a dog collar. He never mentioned it. In fact, he told me that he didn’t believe in God. ‘The other thing that amazes me is that he was a trustee on the board of the Terrence Higgins Trust but he never practises safe sex. 'He never wears a condom. It was even more staggering that he told me his brother had died of AIDS aged 39.’ The day after The Mail on Sunday’s revelations last week, the Terrence Higgins Trust, Britain’s biggest HIV charity, announced Flowers’s resignation from the post after two years. Added Wilson: ‘Paul’s been a really heavy user of coke and ketamine for a long time. Recently other drugs too, and whatever he said in his statement, it’s not going to be easy for him to come off them just because he’s been publicly exposed. ‘I laughed when I saw his statement saying he was getting professional help – the only professional help he was seeking was from a professional drug fixer – me.’ In a taped telephone conversation later on Tuesday, Flowers told Peter – after he had changed his mind about the invitation to Liverpool – they could have a ‘couple of nights away’ and suggested Manchester. Flowers said: ‘We can’t go abroad, I don’t think, but we could find somewhere either quiet, or somewhere very busy. We could go to Manchester if you like.’ Flowers was staying with Reverend Hu, an ex-addict minister who has spoken about his battles with drugs and alcohol and has a house in the city . Wilson pointed out to Flowers that with the media storm, he would soon be spotted, and asked if he thought that a good idea. Flowers’s reply gave an indication of the supreme arrogance which has been at the root of his downfall: ‘Yep. I do. I think one should be brazen in certain circumstances’. The pair first met two months ago through a gay app called Scruff, said Peter. ‘He messaged me saying, “Do you want to come to a party and sniff some coke?”’ Ex-con Wilson became Flowers’s regular dealer. ‘Not only did I get to sell him the drugs, I also got to use them for nothing afterwards,’ he said. ‘On Remembrance Sunday, Flowers left the house in the morning to go and conduct the service in Bradford. ‘We had been up most of the night but that didn’t stop him laying out a great fat line of coke in the morning, which he sniffed up before he left. ‘I did get worried about him sometimes because his coke habit was massive. He took huge quantities of it, and he’s 63 years old and clearly overweight. ‘He’s really pushing his luck, especially combining it with ketamine, crack and GHB.’ The Mail on Sunday put all the allegations in our stories today to the Rev Flowers’s solicitor, former chairman of Leeds North East Labour Party Andy Hollas last night. Mr Hollas said: ‘I cannot comment on any of these allegations, save to say I find it utterly fanciful and they smack of the kind of contrived nonsense that has been mentioned about my client. ‘If he has a comment to make I’m sure he’ll contact me and make an appropriate statement, but at the moment, police enquiries are ongoing and you’ll appreciate that I’m not saying anything.’","'I think one should be brazen,' said minister who 'didn't believe in God'

Two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers on a training mission flew over disputed islands in the East China Sea without informing Beijing, Pentagon officials said Tuesday. The controversial action defies China's declaration of a new airspace defense zone in the region. The Pentagon said the flight on Monday night did not prompt a response from China, and the White House urged Beijing to resolve its dispute with Japan over the islands diplomatically, without resorting to 'threats or inflammatory language.' China published coordinates for an East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone over the weekend and warned it would take 'defensive emergency measures' against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly in the airspace. Controversial: Two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers, like that pictured, on a training mission flew over disputed islands in the East China Sea without informing Beijing, Pentagon officials said Tuesday . The zone covers most of that sea and includes the skies over islands at the heart of a territorial dispute with Japan. 'The policy announced by the Chinese over the weekend is unnecessarily inflammatory,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in California, where President Barack Obama is traveling. 'These are the kinds of differences that should not be addressed with threats or inflammatory language, but rather can and should be resolved diplomatically,' he said. Two U.S. B-52 bombers carried out the flight, part of a long-planned exercise, on Monday night EST, a U.S. military official said. The lumbering bombers appeared to send a message that the United States was not trying to hide its intentions and showed that China, so far at least, was unable or unwilling to defend the zone. The B-52s, which have been part of the Air Force fleet for more than half a century, are relatively slow compared with today's more advanced fighter jets and far easier to spot than stealth aircraft. The dispute flared before a trip to the region by Vice President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to travel to Japan early next week and also has stops in China and South Korea. The White House announced the trip in early November. The East China Sea territorial dispute will figure prominently on Biden's agenda. 'We . have conducted operations in the area of the Senkakus. We have . continued to follow our normal procedures, which include not filing . flight plans, not radioing ahead and not registering our frequencies,' spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said, using the Japanese name for the . islands. The . United States and close ally Japan have sharply criticized China's . airspace declaration, with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel calling it . a 'destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region.' He said on Saturday the United States would not change how it operated there. Experts . said the Chinese move was aimed at chipping away at Tokyo's claim to . administrative control over the area, including the tiny uninhabited . islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. Islands: The Pentagon said the flight on Monday night did not prompt a response from China, and the White House urged Beijing to resolve its dispute with Japan over the islands in the East China Sea, pictured, diplomatically, without resorting to 'threats or inflammatory language.' Japan's two biggest airlines - Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings - bowed to a Japanese government request to stop complying with the Chinese demands for flight plans and other information. They will stop providing the information on Wednesday, spokesmen for the carriers said. By demanding airlines file flight plans or risk being intercepted by military jets, China is forcing them to effectively acknowledge Beijing's authority over the Air Defense Identification Zone, which is about two-thirds the size of Britain. But in persuading ANA, JAL and other carriers to ignore the zone, Japan's Primes Minister Shinzo Abe may be calling China's bluff. Some airlines in the region did agree to begin complying with the Chinese identification measures. While Washington does not take a position on the sovereignty of the islands, it recognizes that Japan has administrative control over them and is therefore bound by treaty to defend Japan in the event of an armed conflict. The Pentagon said the training exercise 'involved two aircraft flying from Guam and returning to Guam.' Warren said the U.S. military aircraft were neither observed nor contacted by Chinese aircraft.

Secret millions: The sweet and modest Kathleen Magowan, pictured, lived in a house in Simsbury, Connecticut, while she amassed an estate worth $6 million . The secret lives of a set of elderly twins who lived frugally in Connecticut but were sitting on a gold mine have been revealed. Kathleen and Robert Magowan died within a year of each other after years living as near recluses in their parents' modest Simsbury home, giving their neighbors no clue of $10 million fortune they had built up through savvy investments. It was only once the pair passed that their startling wealth became clear, when Kathleen Magowan left hefty donations to a local elementary school, college and nursing home. Kathleen Magowan was a quiet, unassuming woman who never made headlines during her 87 years, according to the Hartford Courant. She taught first grade at Simsbury Elementary School for 35 years before retiring in 1984 but never married or had children of her own. She lived in a comfortable but plain home on a busy highway in Simsbury that sold for just $250,000 because it hadn't been renovated for decades. Her twin brother, Robert, moved into the family home in their later years. The former Prudential Insurance agent also never married but was largely the source of his sister's wealth through the stocks and bonds he oversaw on her behalf. He died in 2010 with his own sizable estate. When they passed away, the multi-millionaire twins' obituaries mentioned basic details including how they were born in New York City but gave no inkling as to their wealth - a combined $10 million, lawyers have only just determined. The stocks Robert Magowan controlled exploded in value from the 1960s and 1970s to reach dizzying values, but the pair continued to live their quiet existence. 'She never really looked at (her portfolio) because she never had a demand for that kind of money,' attorney Louis George, whose law firm handled her estate, told the Courant. 'It shows the whole buy-and-hold (strategy) instead of these day traders we've seen in the last 10 years. ... She lived a fairly frugal lifestyle.' Home: Kathleen Magowan and her twin brother Robert lived in the comfortable but basic home, pictured, on a busy highway in Simsbury that sold for just $250,000 because it hadn't been renovated for decades . Though it's been two years since her death, lawyers have only now untangled Kathleen Magowan's $6 million estate because she had so many assets and papers hidden away. And the charities are just learning of her generous post-humus donations. Not much of a philanthropist while alive, the elderly woman left a total of $5 million to her 15 favorite causes in her will. She donated nearly $480,000 to her beloved Simsbury public schools, more than $500,000 to the University of St. Joseph in West Hartford, another $400,000 to the McLean nursing home where she died, and nearly $375,000 to her local parish, St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, the Courant reported. The school said the donation from the retired teacher - the biggest they've ever received from anyone - came out of the blue and they are considering using the money to improve the track and field facilities. 'When we got wind of it, it was quite a surprise,' Lydia Tedone, the board's chairwoman, told the Courant. 'It's a great way to honor the legacy of a very special teacher. She believed in the school system. The schools meant something to her.' Generosity: Though it's been two years since her death, lawyers have only now untangled Kathleen Magowan's $6 million estate because she had so many assets and papers hidden away. And the charities are just learning of her generous post-humus donations . School Superintendent Matthew Curtis said a former colleague remembered Magowan as 'a consummate professional' and in class photographs, the 5-foot-4-inch, modestly dressed woman, stands proudly with young students. The nursing home where she died was similarly touched, and surprised. 'All of us remember her very much as the schoolteacher who always had a twinkle in her eye,' Deene Morris, the fundraising director at McLean nursing home told the Courant. 'She always had a sparkle for life. She loved stimulating conversation; ideas and stories. She loved engaging in conversation with all sorts of different people, and everyone loved talking to her. A school teacher. That's how she lived in our hearts.' The development director at the University of Saint Joseph visited Kathleen Magowan at the nursing home in her final months, sharing tea and reminiscing about her time at the college. 'We had no idea,' Burgess said of the elderly woman's bursting portfolio. 'She was low-key, sweet, compassionate. You would never know.' Kathleen Magowan graduated from the West Hartford school in 1947 with a degree in nursing but after a short time working in the pediatric unit at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford she chose to switch careers. She eventually received a master's degree in education in 1953 from what is now the University of Hartford and she embarked on her long career in the Simsbury public school system. She lived a frugal life with few expenses, given she had no children or grandchildren and lived in the unmortgaged home she inherited from her parents. Meanwhile, her wealth expanded steadily. According to the Courant, her biggest win on the stockmarket was with stocks in an obscure Pennsylvania-based motor manufacturing company called Ametek Inc. The decision to invest in the business was Robert Magowan's, and he'd done his research. For years, the twins flew under the radar in the community they'd called home for most of their lives. But now, after her death, Kathleen Magowan's generosity has made her an unforgettable, and beloved figure to all. 'It put a smile on our faces,' Tedone said. 'We looked out the window and looked up to her in heaven, saying, ""Thank you."" She is probably smiling down on us.'","Kathleen and Robert Magowan died within a year of each other after years living as near recluses in their modest Simsbury, Connecticut home .

A 79-year-old Holocaust survivor had an emotional reunion on Wednesday with the son of the Polish family who had risked their lives some 70 years ago to hide him and his parents from the Nazis. The emotional reunion between Leon Gersten, who moved to the U.S. after the end of the second world war and Czeslaw Polziec, 81, who went on to live under Soviet occupation and serve in the Polish army, took place in New York. The two elderly men had last seen each other as boys aged 10 and 11 respectively in 1944, when the Russians liberated their village of Frystak. Scroll down for video . Leon Gersten, right, greets Czeslaw Polziec, of Poland, whose family had sheltered him from the Nazis. The pair had not seeing each other for 69 years until Wednesday when they met in New York . Gersten, accompanied by his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren welcomed Polziec at JFK airport after his exhausting trans-Atlantic flight and presented him with a bouquet of flowers. A beaming Gersten embraced and clasped the hand of a visibly moved Polziec, whose Polish parents had risked everything to save five Jews during World War II. ‘It's like getting to know each other again,’ Gersten had told reporters earlier. ‘To me and my children they're heroes.’ Gersten, along with his mother, aunt, uncle and cousin, hid from 1942 to 1944 in the hayloft of the Polziec's farm in Nazi-occupied Poland. Polziec recalled how he was told never to speak about their Jewish guests as their discovery would have resulted in certain death for everyone . He described his parents as honest people trying to do the right thing. The two elderly men had last seen each other as boys aged 10 and 11 respectively in 1944, when the Russians liberated their village of Frystak . 'I am very happy after 69 years of being in Poland and finally meeting my friend,' he said. 'God saved us all.' Gersten's grandparents were amongst the Jews rounded up and killed by the Natzis in the Polish town of Frystak in July 1942. His mother Frieda managed to escape the ghetto by disguising herself as a Catholic with a cross around her neck. Many people turned her away when she sought someone willing to take her family in, but Maria and Stanislaw Polziec took her in, despite being poor and already having five children. The family built an underground bunker, just big enough for the Jews and covered with a grain storage bin in the event of a raid. They gave them a loaf of bread a week, and the Polziec children collected mushrooms in the forest to make soup. Czeslaw Polziec, center, meets Leon Gersten's five children, 34 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren . Nazi collaborators raided the farm one day and beat Stanislaw Polziec mercilessly, but still he never betrayed their whereabouts. After the war, Gersten emigrated to New York and the two families lost contact after his mother died. He will now take Czeslaw home to Long Island, New York to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah together as well as Thanksgiving on Thursday. Gersten has five children, 34 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. He got a doctorate from Columbia University. After the army, Polziec worked in security for many years. He married and has two daughters. The reunion was facilitated by The Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, which gives financial assistance to around 650 aged and needy Holocaust rescuers in Europe. Six million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis during World War II. More than half of them were Polish. Gersten's father, sister and three brothers were among those who perished.

If you thought Snakes On A Plane was goosebump-inducing, wait until you see 'snake on a car'. Two men in Queensland, Australia, got the shock of their lives while driving down a three-lane road at about 70km/h (about 43 mph). Despite their speed, all of a sudden an inquisitive red-bellied black snake - a venomous creature native to the country's east coast, which can grow up to 2 meters long - pops up out of nowhere on their windscreen. The driver and passenger, not knowing what to do, slow down and start filming the experience. Scroll down for video . 'Get off my freakin' car!': Driver Ben Lehmann freaks out as a red-bellied black snake entangles itself on his car in Queensland, Australia . Ben Lehmann and his passenger were driving in Capalaba, Queensland when all of a sudden the poisonous snake appeared on the bonnet of the car . The video, which has received almost 200,000 hits on YouTube, shows the men try a variety of different methods to try and get the snake off their utility. The incident occurred on Mount Gravatt Rd in Capalaba, a semi-urban area just east of the state's capital city, Brisbane. Initially the pair use their windscreen wipers to try and flick the dangerous animal off. However this only entangles it further. It also seems to enrage the snake. Red with anger: In this scary moment of the video, the red-bellied snake, seeming quite enraged, attempts to find a way into the car. Luckily for the two men inside, all the windows were done up . Eeek! The snake makes its move from the windscreen to the passenger window . In the sunlight, the red scales the snake that define the snake become apparent . 'I don't know what to do - he's got too much grip,' the driver says at one point. In the second part of the video, which is much more intense, the now-angry snake can be seen nudging the window of the passenger window, appearing to try and get inside the car. The driver then decides to speed up the car hoping the snake will fall off in the process. However it hangs on. Finally, after about five minutes recording two videos, the snake finally falls from the car. I can see you: The snake looks straight into the camera while wrapping itself around the side mirror . Psss: The snake continues to try and get inside the car, much to the horror of the men inside . It hits the ground and slithers off the road, hiding underneath a shipment of bricks outside the All Seasons Garden Center. Not that this would have helped the men at the time, but bites from a red-bellied black snake are rarely life-threatening. While their venemon is highly toxic, the snakes usually choose to inject very little when biting. Humans who are bit, however, require immediate medical attention. Finally!: After about five minutes, the snake finally falls from the vehicle and slithers off into the distance .","Two men driving down a three-lane road in Capalaba, a town in Queensland, Australia, were not anticipating a snake to climb aboard their utility .

Aerial photos of Washington, Illinois, show the heartbreaking scale of the description visited on the town after tornadoes touched down there Sunday night. Eighty one separate twisters were reported across the Midwest. The devastating storm outbreak brought winds of up to 200mph that flattened hundreds of homes and killed six people. Residents of Washington, a downstate town of 15,000, were left to pick up the pieces Monday and begin recovering from the disaster. Bits of American flags and insulation from destroyed houses clung to trees that had been stripped of most of their branches and remaining leaves by the twister. Scroll down for video . Devastating: This quiet residential block was utterly destroyed by the tornado that touched down Sunday night . Devastated: Entire neighborhoods of Washington, Illinois have been reduced to rubble . Heartbreaking: Only from the air can the immense scale of the destruction in Washington, Illinois, truly be seen. Hundreds of homes were reduced to splinters by tornadoes that brought 200mph winds . Picking up the pieces: Some residents returned home to survey the wreckage of their homes Monday and retrieve what they could - though some had very, very little left . Police were keeping residents from returning to the storm-hit area, where buildings were destroyed and cars turned upside down, out of concern that people could be injured while attempting to retrieve possessions. Ryan Bowers, 33, and his wife Andrea, 32, briefly returned to retrieve a family Bible and pink baby rattle that was their 2-1/2-year-old daughter Sydney's favorite toy. 'We're back here just to get any idea of what everything looks like,' Ryan Bowers said. 'We have what's important. My wife and daughter are OK. That's all I can ask for.' The couple, their daughter and the family's dogs, hid in their basement when the storm roared through Washington. They emerged to find their neighborhood destroyed. As they picked through the wreckage of their home, a police officer approached and told them they had to leave. Mayor Gary Manier said authorities were keeping evacuated residents away out of concern that the remaining structures were dangerously unstable. 'I know it's frustrating for people,' Manier said amid piles of rubble. 'I'd be frustrated. I'd want to be looking for pictures.' Manier estimated that 250 to 500 homes had been destroyed by the tornado, rated as the second-most powerful magnitude of twister, which hit the city east of Peoria with winds of 166 to 200 miles per hour. Leveled: Nothing could withstand the force of the 200mph winds that the fast-moving storms brought to Washington, Illinois, Sunday night . Not even trees were spared the devastating winds. This wooded grove behind a neighborhood was left utterly destroyed by the tornado . Nothing remains of this house except the foundation and concrete steps. The entire structure was swept away by the violent storm . Force of nature: A small, pink baby bed somehow survived the winds. It was one of the few things this family could salvage from their home . The storm killed three people in Massac Country, two in Washington County and one in the city of Washington, in Tazewell County, said Patti Thompson of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Illinois State Police spokesman Dustin Pierce said about 120 people were injured in Washington. BASEMENT SAFE HAVENS . Survivors of the storm said they rode it out in their basements, which are common in homes in the affected area, a fact that may have helped hold down the death toll, officials said. In May, a monster, top-category tornado killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma, a part of the United States where basements are less common. Nancy Rampy, 62, said she fled to her basement when she heard the storm sirens blaring on Sunday. 'It got real calm and I knew that was bad because I've been in a tornado before. And then I heard what sounded like 12 trains, just roaring down the tracks, and it just wouldn't stop. It just kept coming and coming,' Rampy said. 'I ran to the basement, sat in the basement with my flashlight in the dark and just prayed let it be over soon.' Rampy's house was spared. 'The good news is the tornado warning system worked, so there wasn't a lot of loss of life,' said U.S. Representative Aaron Schock, a Republican whose district includes Washington. 'These people knew what was coming, and they were smart and took cover.' Entire square blocks were wiped out by the twister that tore through the downstate town Sunday. The death toll thus far stands at six . Cars and SUV were flung around like kindling by the storm. The white sedan and the blue SUV sit in what remains of tow garages in a subdivision . This is what remains of an apartment building. The roof has been torn entirely off the top floor units and several walls have collapsed .

Two people, an 80-year-old man and his 78-year-old sister, were killed in Washington County, Illinois, about 200 miles south of Peoria, county Coroner Mark Styninger said. Three others were killed in Massac County, Illinois, on the Kentucky border, where a tornado devastated several neighborhoods, emergency officials said. The American Red Cross has worked with emergency management officials to set up shelters and provide assistance. In neighboring Kentucky, the storm system damaged several homes in the western part of the state, ripping shingles and gutters from roofs, scattering tree limbs and taking down power lines. But no one died and no injuries were reported, according to Kentucky Emergency Management spokesman Buddy Rogers. 'We literally dodged a bullet,' he said. 'When you look across the river (into Illinois), there are places that are just wiped out. But we're in good shape.' The unusual late-season storms moved dangerously fast, tracking east at 60 miles per hour, with the bulk of the damage spanning about five hours, Thompson said. Remnants of the storm sent rain and wind to the northeastern United States on Monday morning. The storm knocked down power lines across the Midwest and power companies reported that some 786,600 homes and businesses were without electricity on Monday. Michigan had the largest number of outages, with Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Pennsylvania also feeling the storm's aftermath.

Simpson’s ex-wife Nicole Brown was the victim of a known serial killer and not her famous football star ex-husband. Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing two women in 1995, is on death row in Florida. He reportedly confessed to the brutal stabbings of Nicole and her friends Ron Goldman. However, Fred Goldman, Ron's father, isn't buying then new 'confession.' He remains adamant that OJ Simpson killed his son. The new theory, floated by filmmakers for Investigation Discovery, marks only the second time an alternate suspect has been suggested in the 1994 murder. The nine-month trial of millionaire OJ Simpson, defended by some of the top attorneys in the nation, remains the most explosive court case in modern American history. Different suspect: Glen Rogers is on death row in Florida and has been linked to five other murders, but now he is thought to be the killer of Nicole Brown Simpson as well . Domestic life: Simpson was married to Nicole Brown for seven years; here, they're pictured at the opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe; Brown filed for divorce in 1992 . The acquittal of Simpson on the murder charges is still a deeply divisive topic. Investigation . Discovery, an offshoot of the Discovery Channel, reports that Rogers . boasted that he befriended Nicole shortly after he moved to Los Angeles . from Ohio. He is said to have bragged about partying with her and, more ominously, warning that she was rich and he was ‘going to take her down’. The New York Post reports that Rogers confessed to the crime years after he was already jailed for the murders of the two other women, even giving police a few receipts as evidence that he was in the area at the time of the double-homicide in June 1994. The documentary explains that the reason why Rogers’ name has never come up before is because Simpson was purposefully keeping his connection to Rogers under wraps. Rogers, who at one point boasted about having killed up to 70 women in a cross-country serial spree, alleges that Simpson hired him to break into his ex wife’s home to steal a pair of $20,000 earrings. Adding up: A new documentary bases the connection of Rogers to the Simpson case largely on his own confession . Timeline: Rogers said that he was hired by OJ to steal expensive earrings from Nicole's home and he gave him permission to kill 'that b****' if necessary . He also says that while the original intention of the partnership was to get the earrings, Simpson gave Rogers permission to kill ‘the b****’ if necessary. Fred Goldman has campaigned to keep his son Ron, 25, from being forgotten as only Nicole Brown Simpson's friend. He has not given any thought to the suggestion that someone other than OJ maybe have been responsible for the murders. 'OJ Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The criminal trial showed overwhelming and monumental evidence that OJ Simpson was the killer. There was no contrary evidence other than guess, innuendo, and rumor,' he told TMZ. Mr Goldman says he believes Investigation Discovery is playing up Rogers' alleged confession to boost the ratings of the show. The documentary does not feature Rogers himself, who is serving time on death row in Florida, but it comes close to home as it is based largely on interviews with his brother Clay who was the person to tip police off to Glen’s whereabouts. 'Gimmick': Fred Goldman, the father of murder victim Ron Goldman, says he still believes OJ killed his son . Murdered: Ron Goldman, 25, an aspiring actor, was found stabbed to death, along with Nicole Brown Simpsons . Glen allegedly told Clay about the . Brown-Goldman murder but he did not believe it. Later on, Glen spoke to a . criminal investigator and went through step-by-step details of how the . murder took place. Rogers is suspected of being a prolific murderer who used his charm and good looks to pick up women at bars. He is currently on death row in Florida for the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs in Tampa. He and Cribbs reportedly had sex at a motel after meeting at a bar. He then stabbed her multiple times and left her to bleed to death in the bathtub. He was later convicted of murdering Sandra Gallagher, a mother of three, in Los Angeles in 1995, as well. Her body was found in her burning pickup truck. He is also suspected in the deaths of women in Mississippi and Louisiana. California authorities suspect he was behind four other murders in that state, as well. At one point, Rogers boasted her murdered 70 people, though later recanted and said he was only joking. The truth behind the murders of Nicole . Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman has gotten murkier, not clearer in the 17 . years since OJ's acquittal. The timeline of the crime has long . been a point of contention as OJ infamously signed a deal to pen a book . called ‘If I Did It’ which was ultimately cancelled. Numerous friends and acquittance have . come forward, claiming firsthand or secondhand knowledge of OJ . confessing to the crime. However, the former football star and actor has . publicly maintained his innocence. Despite being found not guilty at the . criminal trial, the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman . sued OJ in civil court. Trial run: In the sensational 1995 murder trial, O.J. Simpson tries on a leather glove allegedly used in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman . Acquitted: Simpson, centre, smiled while standing with his attorneys F. Lee Bailey, left, and Johnnie Cochan, right, after hearing the not guilty verdict in his criminal murder trial; Cochran died in 2005 . Several pieces of evidence were introduced that had been excluded from the criminal case. The jury found Simpson legally liable for the wrongful deaths of the two victims. Their families were awarded more than $33million in damages. Earlier this year, private investigator William Dear floated a theory that OJ's son Jason Simpson committed the murders. In a book, Mr Dear claimed that OJ stood trial to deflect attention away from his son, who he says was mentally unstable at the time. The theory has been called 'absolutely absurd' by some legal analysts. One of the key witnesses in the case, Kato Kaelin, a small-time actor who testified for several days at the trial, has flipped-and-flopped back and forth on whether he believes Simpson committed the crimes. Most recently, he said he had no direct knowledge of Simpson admitting to the crimes. Simpson is now serving 33 years in prison for a recent armed robbery in Las Vegas. In 2007, two sports memorabilia dealers say Simpson and four other men reportedly broke into their hotel room and robbed them at gunpoint. Simpson denies that he used weapons and claims he was only taking back property that was rightfully his from his days as a college football and NFL star.

A man has developed a bizarre allergy to the cold that means that even a single snowflake could kill him. Bernard Ward's skin explodes into angry hives if he comes into contact with anything cold - from a snowflake to a cold pint of beer. And the reactions can be so bad that he can even go into potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. Bernard Ward suffers from a bizarre allergy to the cold. The retail worker's skin explodes into angry hives if he comes into contact with anything cold - from a snowflake to a cold pint of beer . Doctors believe Mr Ward developed the condition after standing at a bus stop in temperatures of -10C in Scotland last year. The retail worker now has to wrap up warm even indoors - and doesn’t dare venture outside in particularly cold weather. Even the gym is out of bounds - because the air conditioning could trigger a deadly reaction. Mr Ward, from Derry, Northern Ireland, said: 'I dread winter coming - I know most people don’t like the cold but it could be deadly for me. 'It costs me a fortune in heating bills and thick clothes, but I have no other choice. 'Since I developed the allergy, it’s . totally changed my life. A simple night out with my mates down the pub . is out of the question.' Mr Ward's reactions can be so bad that he can even go into potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. He now has to wrap up warm even indoors - and doesn't dare venture outside in particularly cold weather . He first noticed some aggravation to the cold while commuting to Belfast in winter 2011. He said: 'Every time I was waiting for the bus my hands began to itch really badly and burn, as if I had put them in a pile of nettles. 'I thought nothing of it and got on with things and hoped it would go away. 'My GP said it was probably a reaction to washing powder, or something I’d eaten, but in February 2012, I was on a three-week course in Scotland. 'On my first evening there, it was about -10, and I was waiting on a bus to take me back to the hotel. I wasn’t wearing any gloves and I was carrying bags. 'After a few minutes my fingers and hands began to swell up so badly I couldn’t bend them. Mr Ward was eventually diagnosed with cold uticaria - a type of allergy that causes the body to react badly to not only touching anything cold, but also sudden drops in temperature . 'My face also was burning and itching and I was wheezing. I got to the hotel room, after changing out of my clothes into something warmer, I noticed my thighs had swollen and were covered in huge welts, too.' It was only then that doctors diagnosed him with a severe allergy to the cold. Mr Ward added: 'At the time, I worked in a busy retail store, the air conditioning was on for about an hour and I just didn’t feel well and couldn’t work out why. 'I remember feeling like I was going to faint and I was having the most uncomfortable heart palpitations. 'I went out the back to sit down for a bit and noticed my hands were covered in hives. Mr Ward must wear gloves to touch anything cold. He said: 'Having cold drinks made my throat swell and even holding a pint of cold beer on a night out made my hand swell up' 'I wrapped up took antihistamines and went home. After this I was referred to a specialist.' A hospital specialist confirmed that Bernard was suffering from cold urticaria - a type of allergy that causes the body to react badly to not only touching anything cold, but also sudden drops in temperature. At present there is no known cure for cold urticaria but it can be managed through the use of antihistamines . and keeping as warm us possible. He said: 'Initially it got me very down and anxious. I couldn't understand what was happening to me and I kept thinking that it would go away soon. 'I gradually stopped doing everyday things like going to the gym as the air conditioning affected me. 'I could no longer play football as playing outdoors gave me bad reactions and socialising became a nightmare. 'Having cold drinks made my throat swell and even holding a pint of cold beer on a night out made my hand swell up. Support: Mr Ward with his fiance Mairead. He said: 'Going out at night is not an easy task either as we have to plan in advance and have taxi pick us up then leave early, to avoid not standing in a taxi queue at night' 'I have to wear ridiculous amounts of clothes in the winter and it's tough covering transport costs, clothing costs and fuel bills.' Although the condition has had a massive impact on his life and those closest to him, Bernard says he has amazing support from his family including his fiancé Mairead who he hopes to marry next year. 'My fiancé has been great. She adapted really well to my condition and gives me support every day. 'At first things were tough and they still are as we can no longer do outdoor things like going for a walk. 'Going out at night is not an easy task either as we have to plan in advance and have taxi pick us up then leave early as to not be standing in a taxi queue at night. 'It took people a while to realise the extent of it and people do still forget themselves sometimes and ask me to do things which I just can’t do any more.' Cold urticaria is an allergy to cold temperatures, where exposure causes redness, itching, swelling and hives on the skin. As much as possible, people with cold urticaria should avoid exposure to cold air and cold water. Swimming in cold water, for example, is the most common cause of a severe, whole-body reaction - leading to fainting, shock and even death, according to the Mayo Clinic. The majority of cold urticaria reactions occur when skin is exposed to temperatures lower than 4.4C (40 F), but some people can have reactions to warmer temperatures. Damp and windy conditions may make cold urticaria more likely. Symptoms include: Reddish, itchy hives (wheals) on the area of skin that was exposed to cold, swelling of hands when holding cold objects, swelling of lips when eating cold foods. What causes the condition isn't clear, but some people appear to have overly sensitive skin cells, either due to an inherited trait or caused by a virus or other illness. In some cases, cold urticaria goes away on its own after several months. In other cases, it lasts many years.

Buhrman, a former senior reactor operator at the Dresden nuclear plant in Chicago, was extradited from Venezuela late last month after a year on the run and has been sentenced to 40 years in prison . A former nuclear plant employee in Chicago was the mastermind of a wild scheme involving an armoured car heist, car theft, money laundering and smuggling guns and steroids. Michael J. Buhrman, a senior reactor operator at the Dresden nuclear plant, was extradited from Venezuela late last month after a year on the run and has started serving his 40-year sentence for the carjacking. He is still awaiting possible additional charges in connection for his alleged smuggling, which happened in the South America country where he was hiding from authorities. He is the . alleged mastermind of the scheme, which was supposedly inspired by the . 2010 Ben Affleck movie The Town, in which a group of Boston buddies rob . several banks and Fenway Park, according to NBC News. According . to court and Nuclear Regulatory Commission documents, Buhrman tried to . recruit co-workers at the nuclear plant, about 45 miles south of . Chicago, and eventually succeeded in persuading colleague, Landon . Brittain, to participate in the robbery of an armored car. The two never managed to do the robbery because they were caught for stealing a car they planned to use for the heist. The . crime spree started on May 9, 2012, when Buhrman accosted a woman in a . parking lot outside a Kohl’s store in Woodridge, about 30 minutes west . of Chicago. Police . said he was disguised as an old man in an elaborate latex mask and . threatened the woman with a .45-caliber Beretta semiautomatic handgun . before speeding off in her  2000 Pontiac Grand Am. But a witness followed and called police, who corraled Buhrman less than a quarter of a mile away. Police say Brittain, another senior reactor operator at the nuclear plant, acted as a lookout during the carjacking – though he wasn’t arrested at the time. Inspiration: The scheme was supposedly inspired by the 2010 Ben Affleck movie The Town, in which a group of Boston buddies rob several banks and Fenway Park . Awaiting trial: Buhrman presuaded his colleague, Landon Brittain, another senior reactor operator at the nuclear plant, to act as a lookout during the carjacking. He is being held on a $1 million bail . According to documents, the two men intended to use the stolen car in the armored car robbery. ‘I’ve . been in investigations quite a bit of my career, and for someone like . Michael Buhrman, who seemed to have a lot going for him, to be messed up . in something like this, I’ve never seen anything like it,’ said . Woodridge, Ill., Deputy Police Chief Tom Stefanson. The . case also sent ripples through the nuclear power industry, prompting . the Exelon Corp. – which owns the Dresden plant and is the largest U.S. operator of nuclear reactors – to change how it trains its employees to . spot and report behavior that might pose a security threat. Buhrman . was released on bond, but police were alerted by a girlfriend who said . he was intending to flee to Chile and had access to offshore bank . accounts, according to NBC. In June 2012, a judge added conditions to his bail, including a GPS ankle monitor. That . proved insufficient to keep Buhrman grounded. In September, police . responded to an alert from the monitor and found it cut off in his Coal . City home. Police also . testified that $14,000 that had been deposited into Buhrman’s bank . account from a foreign source was withdrawn three days before he . disappeared. Richard . Blass, Buhrman’s attorney, told NBC there were signs of violence at the . scene but that he had not been allowed to speak to Buhrman since he was . brought back to the U.S. Blass did say that an appeal was being . explored. Brittain also disappeared and his family started an online campaign to bring him back. Brittain's attorney did not return a call seeking comment, Brittain has pleaded not guilty. Melissa Gates, who divorced Buhrman in 2008, told NBC that he came to see their son three days before he fled, but gave no indication that he planned to leave the country. At the time, police suspected both men had fled to South America, and in April 2013, Buhrman was convicted in absentia in the carjacking. The bank robbery plot emerged a month later at another hearing at which he was sentenced to 40 years in prison . By then, Buhrman and Brittain were reportedly living the high life in Venezuela. An independent journalist who has covered the case said the former power plant operators had rented an apartment in a luxury high-rise building in Caracas and frequented a nearby gym. Protocol: The case prompted Exelon Corp - which owns the Dresden plant where Buhrman worked, and is the largest U.S. operator of nuclear reactors - to change how it trains its employees to report strange behavior . They might be there yet had they not gotten involved with a Venezuelan man who was under suspicion of drug trafficking, illegal weapons trade and money laundering by authorities there, said journalist Lucas Hixson, who writes for a nuclear power website, Enformable. Hixson reported that sources told him that agents discovered Buhrman had conspired with the Venezuelan man to ship $500,000 in cash into Venezuela in a shipment of nutritional supplements. But the Venezuelan took the money and tried to betray the men to police, the sources told Hixson, adding that Buhrman and Brittain were also investigated in cases involving smuggling of illegal arms and steroids. Buhrman and Brittain were arrested and both Americans were deported. Brittain was sent back to the United States in July. He is being held in lieu of $1 million bail and is next scheduled to appear in court in December. Buhrman was arrested in Venezuela in September and was extradited to the U.S. at the end of October, Darrah said. He was handed over to state custody to begin serving his 40-year prison term.","Michael J.

It is an organisation which has helped the world's most desperate people for more than a century, and its symbol is instantly recognised as a sanctuary and beacon of hope the world over. Founded 150 years ago, the Red Cross is the world's oldest and largest humanitarian organisation, and has been involved in virtually every conflict and disaster in recent memory. But rather than resting on its laurels for its anniversary, the movement, currently active in countries including Syria, the Philippines and Iraq, has used the date to highlight the plight of refugees to the rest of the world. History: These American Red Cross nurses collect money in Birmingham, Alabama in 1918 . Salvation: A Red Cross worker lifts the child of refugees fleeing the Rwanda genocide in the 1990s . Aid: Refugees displaced by the eruption of a volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo queue for food provided by the Red Cross . Rescuer: A member of the Italian red cross carries an Albanian girl, fleeing the country's rebellion in 1997 . Treatment: A Red Cross paramedic attends to wounded Muhammed Mahd, whose house was bombed by Israeli warplanes in 2006 Lebanon War . A series of events including theatre and a photography exhibition will show the Red Cross's involvement in conflicts as far back as the 1950s, though the organisation has been active for much longer. It was founded by . Swiss businessman Henry Dunant, who saw the devastation of war in the 1859 in Italy, and formed the organisation four years later in 1863. Its mission is 'to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance.' The workers bring medical supplies and food to disaster areas, as well as helping refugees move through the systems in countries where they seek asylum. Among the most significant interventions of the Red Cross in recent decades were in the Hungarian revolution of 1956, the Vietnam war in the 1970s, the Gulf War in the early 1990s and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Rations: An Albanian boy receives two loaves of bread and two cans of milk from the Red Cross in the Kosovo War . Help from above: A Red Cross helicopter drops off aid in Kosovo .

The Red Cross is also heavily involved in providing aid in Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp. The centre in Kenya is home to 470,000 people and covers an area twice as large as Manchester. They also help in the wake of natural disasters, including the Iranian earthquake of 1962, the major African famine of the 1980s, the Colombian earthquake of 1999 as well as more recent disasters including Hurricans Katrina and Sandy in the US and Typhoon Haiyan in the Phillippines, recovery efforts for which are still in full force. In the UK the organisation has helped in the wake of events such as Lockerbie air disaster in Scotland in 1988, the Easter floods which ravaged the Midlands in 1998. Earlier this year the British Red Cross announced it would start collecting and distributing food to the needy - the first time it has taken such action since the Second World War. Nick Scott Flynn, Head of Refugee . Services at the British Red Cross said: 'We wanted to do something that . would impact the British consciousness long-term for our 150th year. Ongoing efforts: This plane was sent to the Philippines yesterday by the Red Cross from Stansted airport, and carried 85 tonnes of relief materials to the crisis . Danger: Red Cross workers in Syria face a damaged urban environment . Supplies: Aid workers in Syria carry the flag of the Red Crescent movement, which is part of the Red Cross organisation . Treatment: Medics in Syria treat an injured man . It’s . easy for refugees to be seen in two dimensional terms – a mass of . people, a problem, so often a political hot potato. This work will . challenge that.' Patrice Shema, a former refugee from Rwanda, participated in the project and said: 'That sense of being a refugee is so strong. It’s been so many years, it stays raw, always there. 'I don’t regret it though. It makes you feel more determined to make a home for yourself.' The centerpiece of the anniversary exhibition will be portraits of refugees by Paul Conroy, who was working with Sunday Times war correspondent Marie Colvin when she was killed in Syria last year. He said: 'This project has brought my own experience of recording conflicts over almost two decades, full-circle. Refugees are so often faceless in our minds.

Two years on he's now a normal, cheeky five-year-old - and, while he's managed to kick the habit, he now has another addiction. Food. Aldi Rizal became an international media sensation when he was discovered in a poor village in Sumatra, Indonesia, puffing on a cigarette while riding his tricycle. Scroll down for video . Toddler Aldi Rizal stunned the world when it was revealed he had a 40-a-day smoking habit at just two years old . Destructive: The youngster was discovered in a poor village in Sumatra, Indonesia, puffing on a cigarette while riding his tricycle . Now Aldi has picked up a new addiction - to food. His huge appetite has seen him gorge on junk food and fatty snacks . The outcry led to the Indonesian government launching a campaign to tackle the problem of children smoking and organising special rehabilitation treatment to help Aldi quit. Aldi was taken for play therapy sessions in the capital Jakarta for two weeks to take his mind off his 40-a-day habit and learn to be a normal toddler for the first time. A new documentary series revisits the family two years on to find out how Aldi is getting on and reveals he has managed to stay off the cigarettes, but is still dangerously unhealthy. During his rehabilitation treatment, Aldi saw psychiatrists who encouraged his mother to keep him busy with playing and taught her about the dangers of smoking. One of them - Dr Kak Seto - still sees Aldi and his family at regular intervals to ensure he is not falling back into old habits. His mother Diane Rizal, 28, said: 'There are many people still offering Aldi cigarettes, but Aldi no. He says ""I love Kak Seto. He would be sad if I started smoking again and made myself ill."" Aldi weighs nearly four stone, double what he should be for a child his age, and medics have urged his mother to put her son on a diet . Trying to be normal: Aldi was taken for play therapy sessions in the capital Jakarta for two weeks to take his mind off his 40-a-day habit . Aldi's addiction to fatty foods sees him drinking three cans of condensed milk a day (he is pictured centre) 'At first when we were weaning Aldi off the cigarettes he would have terrible tantrums and I would call Dr Seto for help. 'But now he doesn't want them.' However, Mrs Rizal is now worried about her son's weight, as he developed food cravings while quitting smoking, and now has a big appetite. Mrs Rizal said the strong-willed little boy now demands food in the same way he used to beg for cigarettes, and the family struggles not to give in to his tantrums. Mrs Rizal said: 'When Aldi first quit smoking he would demand a lot of toys. Aldi's mother Diane Rizal, 28, says people still offer her son cigarettes even though he has kicked the habit . 'He would bang his head on the wall if . he couldn't get what he wanted. That's why I get him cigarettes in the . first place - because of his temper and his crying. 'Now . I don't give him cigarettes, but he eats a lot. With so many people . living in the house it's hard to stop him from getting food.' Aldi . also helps his mother and father Mohamed out on their market stall, . where his bright bubbly character and cheekiness wins him lots of . attention. 'I feel happy when people want to speak to him because the know him,' admitted Mrs Rizal. Aldi, with his mother, Diane, 28, and father Mohamed . 'But I feel annoyed when they refer to him as 'the smoking kid'. It makes me feel like they are accusing me of being a bad parent.' Mr and Mrs Rizal decided to take Aldi to a nutritionist for medical checks and now they've been given advice on how to put him on a healthier diet so he can start to lose some weight. 'Aldi is very overweight, his weight doesn't match his age,' said nutritionist Fransisca Dewi. 'His ideal weight is 17kg to 19kg. He's 24kg already. 'I think it is difficult for them. The mother says Aldi is a spoilt kid. If Diana wants to forbid him eating, it will be hard. 'She will need the cooperation from the entire household. One obvious thing is they let him have too much condensed milk. He drinks three cans a day and eats too many carbohydrates.' Paediatric specialist Dr William Nawawi is also concerned that smoking at an early age has made Aldi more likely to suffer weight issues. He explained: 'Nicotine can increase the endocrine hormone in the body. This condition can cause resistance to insulin. 'The blood will not be able to break glucose from food. This will make Aldi become bigger and bigger.' Now, Aldi is back at home in his fishing village and is on a strict diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and smaller portions. Mrs Rizal must also persuade Aldi's siblings and the rest of the family not to give in and provide him with junk food when she is not around. Doctors hope that if Aldi can lose around half a stone to a stone, his weight will eventually even out as he starts to grow taller. It is thought one-third of children in Indonesia try smoking before the age of ten. The Government has launched efforts to tackle the problem. Aldi's story can be seen in Elephant Man: Body Bizarre on TLC UK at 10pm on Monday November 18.","Aldi Rizal was pictured chain-smoking cigarettes aged just two .

"By . Margot Peppers . PUBLISHED: . 17:40 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:52 EST, 12 December 2013 . A parenting book that advocates whipping and spanking children with branches, rods and belts has come under fire after it was linked to three deaths in the past seven years. To Train Up a Child, written by Michael and Debi Pearl, was first published in 1994 and quickly became popular among evangelical Christians as a guide to teaching young children discipline and 'unquestioning obedience'. But the book has been courting controversy ever since it was released, with critics branding it 'monstrous' for promoting child abuse, triggering psychological problems and even leading to death. Controversial content: Parenting guide To Train Up a Child, written by Michael and Debi Pearl in 1994, advocates whipping and spanking children with branches, rods and belts . The book advises 'training' children 'before the crisis arises', so that the child is obedient before they even know the meaning of rebellion. An excerpt reads: 'The parents who put off training until the child is old enough to discuss issues or receive explanations find their child a terror long before he understands the meaning of the word. A newborn soon needs training.' 'Training' involves whipping young ones with 'a willowy branch', a one-foot-long ruler, a large tree branch or even a belt, depending on how old they are. The authors advise beginning a child's training when he or she is 'under one year old'. The purpose of this beating is to 'condition the child's mind' and make them surrender completely to their parents' authority. 'If you have to sit on him to spank him then do not hesitate,' says the book. 'And hold him there until he is surrendered. . . Defeat him totally.' Many fundamentalist and evangelical . Christians, like the authors themselves, have gravitated towards this . guide since it claims to preach 'Biblical' parenting methods. 'Shame on anyone who reads this book or contributes to this ministry of sadists in any way' Indeed, one part reads: 'When the time comes to apply the rod, take a deep breath, relax, and pray, ""Lord, make this a valuable learning session. Cleanse my child of ill-temper and rebellion. May I properly represent your cause in this matter.""' But countless petitions and . objections have also arisen, some of which have been launched by those . whose parents used the Pearls' techniques on them. One . woman in her mid-twenties - who asked to be called Hannah - told the . BBC that when she was growing up in a community of Independent . Fundamentalist Baptists in Florida, her parents read and became . fascinated with To Train Up a Child. Backlash: A number of petitions have been established, pushing for the book to be removed from stores and websites. Angry customers voice their opinions on Amazon (pictured) Monstrous: 'If was a book on training dogs, the authors would be arrested for inciting cruelty against animals,' wrote one critic. 'But because it's in the name of a 2,000 year old religion, they get away with it' Hannah was nine when they began spanking her with wooden rulers and yardsticks, usually several times a day. After one particular incident, her father thought she was being 'melodramatic' when she complained that it hurt to sit down. 'We have several million very happy parents who've seen wonderful fruit from that . book' 'Then he had mother look,' she recalled, 'and [my coccyx] was incredibly bruised and swollen.' The incident caused Hannah's father to abandon the Pearls' technique, but not every parent has such a revelatory moment. Indeed, many children have suffered the consequences when the parenting technique went awry - including three children who died at the hands of parents who followed the bookâ€™s advice. Hana Williams was 13 when she died of hypothermia and malnutrition in 2011 after being left out in the rain in her family's back yard in a small Washington State town. The authors: 'We have several million very happy and cheerful parents and kids who've seen great, wonderful fruit from that book and other things we've written,' said co-author Michael Pearl (left, with wife Debi) This September, her parents - who followed the strict principles set out in To Train Up A Child - were convicted of manslaughter, and each faces a possible life sentence. In 2010, seven-year-old Lydia Schatz died from massive tissue damage after being beaten by her parents, who also read the book, and in 2006, four-year-old Sean Paddock was suffocated in blankets by his adoptive mother and father. Popular: To Train Up a Child has sold more than 800,000 copies and sales have not wavered in the 19 years since it was first published . Since these deaths, a number of petitions have been established, pushing for the book to be removed from websites and bookstores,  and two UK bookstores - Waterstones and Foyles - have taken it off their shelves. And while Amazon has opted not to remove it, the website has encouraged customers to write negative reviews of the book in the comments section if they feel inclined to do so. 'How to Hate Your Child should be the name of this book,' wrote one enraged reader. 'The deaths of three (at least) children hang over their heads. Shame on anyone who reads this book or contributes to this ministry of sadists in any way.' Another customer called it 'horrific' and 'sadistic'. 'If was a book on training dogs, the authors would be arrested for inciting cruelty against animals,' he continued. 'But because it's in the name of a 2,000 year old religion, they get away with it. It's monstrous.' According to Michael Pearl, To Train Up a Child has sold more than 800,000 copies and sales have not wavered in the 19 years since it was first published, despite heavy criticism. 'We have several million very happy and cheerful parents and kids who've seen great, wonderful fruit from that book and other things we've written,' he told the BBC.","To Train Up a Child, written by Michael .

A heart-shaped island that became a lovers' favourite now looks like a perfect destination for the romantically desolate after two strips of forest were bulldozed - leaving scars that look like sticking plasters. Lovers' Island - known locally by the more prosaic name of Galešnjak - is located in the Adriatic Sea, off the coast of the popular tourism destination of Croatia. The uninhabited island caused a stir several years ago when eagle-eyed Google Earth users realised that it looked like a clumsily scrawled heart. Broken-hearted: Lovers' Island - known locally . by the more prosaic name of Galešnjak Island - looks rather forlorn after . bulldozers scraped two huge strips across. The island's owners plan to plant olive groves there, and maybe build a chapel, so that it is more accommodating for weddings and holidaymakers . But a new picture from DigitalGlobe's GeoEye 1 satellite - incidentally taken just around Valentine's Day this year - shows Lovers' Island looking rather more forlorn after bulldozers carved swathes across it that look like two giant bandages. But the island's owner, Tonci Juresko, vowed that the heart-break was only temporary, and that the bulldozed strips are destined to become groves of olive trees. 'I will plant olive trees and the island will be more beautiful than before,' he told Croatian news site Jutarnji List, adding that he had been asked many times to organise weddings there but had been unable to because of the mess. Mr Juresko said he plans to plant 250 new trees on the island and also to restore its pier, which was built 80 years ago by his grandfather. 'It is certain that we will soon have a wedding on the island,' he said. He added that interest in his island had increased since reports emerged claiming that Angelina Jolie was linked to the purchase of another £12.2million heart-shaped island in the U.S. 'We tried offering Valentine's Day trips there but of course that's only once a year and it wasn't really that profitable,' said Mr Juresko. 'But since reports about the apparent . interest of Angelina Jolie in the 11-acre American island of Petra, we . have realised thanks to all the phone calls we have been getting that . there is a lot of potential for our island to be used as a wedding . destination.' How it was: The uninhabited island caused a stir . several years ago when eagle-eyed Google Earth users realised that it . looked like a clumsily scrawled heart . The problem is . that despite the romantic appearance from the air, in reality the . island is covered in rocks and surrounded by a rocky beach - making . access difficult for the average bride in a wedding dress and very . difficult for wedding photographs. Just 130,000 square yards in area, Galesnjak . Island is located in the Adriatic's Pasman channel, between the islands . of Pasman and the coastal town of Turanj . Now following the massive interest, Mr Juresko has managed to get funding to develop the island and the bulldozers have moved in to level broad strips on the surface to make way for a grove of olive trees, to be planted and to improve the jetty to allow wedding parties to land. He said: 'In future it will be possible to have great photographs on the ground as well as from the air, and because it's an island it's very private. People can be as loud as they want. It's the perfect desert island.' The building work was discovered when Google Earth updated its image showing two massive scars across the heart-shaped island, but Mr Juresko insisted they would soon heal and leave the island with a healthy green foliage that he hoped would eventually extend across the rest of the island. Although they may build a chapel, there are no plans to offer anything more complicated in terms of accommodation. Mr Juresko added: 'People can stay the night, but they have to bring their own boat and moor up at the jetty. In theory that means we can accommodate as many people as want to come.' Just 130,000 square yards in area, Galešnjak Island is located in the Adriatic's Pašman channel, between the islands of Pašman and the town of Turanj on mainland Croatia. One of the world's few naturally occurring love heart-shaped objects, its unusual geography was first recorded in the early 19th century by Napoleon's cartographer Charles-François Beautemps-Beaupré. He included it in his 1806 atlas of the Dalmatian coast, kept today at the National and University Library in Zagreb, but it came to global attention in February 2009 when it was highlighted by Google Earth. Mr Juresko and his family were subsequently swamped with requests from smitten holidaymakers who wanted to spend a romantic break there. Vlad Juresko told news agencies at the time that the response had been 'incredible'. 'We think it is the most perfect heart-shaped island in the world. Nobody lives there so if lovers really do want to spend time alone it's the perfect desert island,' he said. 'We always thought it looked a bit like a heart but since it's been on Google Earth everyone else has seen it too and the whole world seems to want to stay here.'","Owner says he has cleared land on the island in order to plant olive groves to make it a beautiful wedding destination .

The 52-year-old man is being questioned on suspicion of her murder by Manchester police. Stabbing: Forensics officers outside the home in Levenshulme, Manchester, where Aisha Alam was found . The body of Mrs Alam was found at her home shortly after noon yesterday. She has four children . Friends said Mrs Alam, who had three daughters and a son, was a teaching assistant at a school for children with special education needs. She moved to England from Pakistan and had been living in her home in the Manchester district of Levenshulme for 25 years. Officers discovered her body just after noon yesterday after a man, understood to be her husband, walked into Longsight police station to report she had been killed. He was held in custody and was still being questioned at 11.30am today. A post mortem which took place last night said Mrs Alam died of multiple stab wounds. Police have named her formally. Mrs Alam's family were too upset to speak last night, but neighbours spoke of their shock. Tragedy: Taped off by police, the house where Aisha Alam's body was found just after noon yesterday . Murder: Police kept a close watch on the house in a quiet street in Levenshulme, Manchester . Friend Saima Baber, 34, said: 'She was a very, very nice person. 'She was quite quiet and kept herself to herself but was such a lovely lady. Forensics officers enter the terraced house in Manchester yesterday . 'I would always stop and say hello and chat and I would do the same with her daughters as well who are lovely. We are all very shocked and scared by what's happened. I saw her daughter at about 8am and everything seemed fine. 'I went shopping in Longsight and I got back and there were police here asking if I had heard anything next door. 'I asked what had happened and they said that Aisha had died and it was very serious. We are just so, so shocked.'

She fled Scotland four years ago after social workers dismissed her as not intelligent enough to get  married, let alone become a mother. But now Kerry McDougall has returned home – and is facing an investigation by officials who, she believes, will decide if her two young sons should be taken from her. The 21-year-old, who has mild learning difficulties, ran away to Ireland with her fiancé Mark when she was eight months pregnant because she feared their son would be taken into care immediately after his birth. Their baby, Ben, was born in January 2010 and the couple went on to wed and have another son, Lochlan, two years ago. New battle: Kerry McDougall with husband Mark, left, and two sons Ben, right, and Lochlan, left. Scottish officials wish to speak with the mother after she left for Ireland when she was pregnant . Despite being classed as fit parents by social services in Ireland, they missed family and friends in Dunfermline, Fife, and two weeks ago, they returned to Scotland. The McDougalls believed that the authorities would no longer be interested in them. Last night, however, they told how social workers visited the family only days after their arrival to say they were reopening proceedings to decide if the boys should be placed under a protection order. On Saturday, they received a letter from Fife Social Services summoning them to a meeting with a panel of social workers, doctors and other child experts next week. Mr McDougall, 30, said: ‘It is talking about a “protection case conference”. It is a very formal letter and feels threatening. Kerry and I are extremely nervous and very worried. ‘We have nothing to defend. We are a normal family and have no idea why Fife social services feel this is necessary or what they expect us to do or say.’ He added: ‘Kerry and I can hardly sleep. We are sick with worry that our sons could be taken away from us. We feel very upset because we believed all this was behind us. ‘We have gone through every assessment possible in Ireland;  our sons are happy, healthy children with married parents. Unnerving: The young mother, pictured at home, says she cannot bear the thought of her children being taken away from her . ‘Yes, Kerry has mild learning difficulties but they don’t stop her from being a mum. And there is no reason why we should be put through the mill again.’ Mrs McDougall said: ‘I can’t bear the thought of my boys being taken away. It’s making me ill.’ The saga began in September 2009 when their church wedding was halted 48 hours before it was due to take place because social services felt the bride ‘did not understand the implications of getting married’. Mrs McDougall was later told her baby would be removed  at birth and placed with foster parents, sparking their decision to flee the UK. In January 2010, while living in Waterford, she gave birth to Ben. Days later Irish social workers, alerted by the ruling of their Scots counterparts, took the child into care. After nine months of assessments, during which Ben lived with foster carers, social services assessed the mother as fit to care for her son. The couple then wed at Waterford register office and set up home nearby, having another son, Lochlan, in November 2011. But the family became homesick. Mrs McDougall said: ‘Dunfermline has always been my home and I wanted to bring my sons up in the same place I grew up.’ The couple claim they visited Fife in October to speak to social services about returning. Mr McDougall said: ‘We felt surely by now, with two children, they could see that Kerry was fine and wouldn’t have any problems. ‘We spoke to them and they agreed that was the case – in fact they seemed amazed that we’d gone to see them at all.’ But they now face a case meeting on November 25. Referring to the McDougalls’ case, Birmingham Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who has campaigned for more openness in family courts, said: ‘The Irish authorities have studied their care for their children and concluded there is no problem. ‘However, the UK authorities want to investigate further... It does appear the authorities in Fife are being vindictive in the way they are dealing with this.’ Dougie Dunlop, head of children and families at Fife Council, said: ‘As with any family moving back to Fife, we will continue to meet with Kerry and Mark to discuss their circumstances so that they receive the care and  support they need.’","Social workers told Kerry McDougall, 21, who suffers from mild learning difficulties, she was not intelligent enough to be a mother four years ago .

John revealed it was co-star Suranne Jones who nudged him towards finally tying the knot when he appeared in detective drama Scott and Bailey. He said: 'She would get on at me constantly for not actually having a wedding date set. 'Whenever I saw her she would ask 'have you got a date yet, John?' and the answer was always 'no'. 'So I suppose it was her that got me to finally get off my bum and set things in motion for the big day. 'Sadly she wasn't able to make the wedding but she did write us a lovely letter which was a really lovely surprise on the day. 'The wedding was fantastic, there were about 120 people at the reception and 250 at the evening do. 'There were lots of people we've worked with during our time as extras, some people came from very far away which was really touching. John won Neilum over and the pair were together for five years before they tied the knot . John, who works full time as a Tesco counter manager, has been a TV extra for 15 years and worked alongside David Tennant . 'Extras have to eat last on set so at the wedding reception there were lots of jokes about whether or not the guests were allowed to queue up. 'It's been absolutely fantastic, I still can't believe we're a married couple, although we've played one so many times maybe I shouldn't be surprised.' Neilum recalled how John even predicted he would marry his leading lady when they first met - although she took some convincing. She said: ''We spent all day filming and at the end of the day he said that one day he would marry me. 'I actually thought he was quite a strange man.' But John won Neilum over and the pair were together for five years before they tied the knot. Neilum even joked that the November 15 ceremony - attended by many TV colleagues - was like being at work. She added: 'There were lots of other extras there who are our friends, it was almost like being on set again.' John Walker, seen here in Shameless, believes he has clocked up 70 hours on screen the equivalent to 35 feature-length films . John Walker, with Larry Lamb from Gavin and Stacey, has even written a book about his experiences . John, who works full time as a Tesco counter manager, has been a TV extra for 15 years and worked alongside acting legends David Jason, Julie Walters, Daniel Radcliffe and Jack Black during his illustrious 'acting' career. At the height of his work he appeared as a doctor in Hollyoaks, Coronation Street and Emmerdale - all in the same week. And last night (Fri) John made his film debut in 'Dead Time' on the Horror Channel, which he also produced. The supermarket worker reckons he has clocked up 70 hours on screen - equivalent to 35 feature-length films - and has even written a book about his experiences. He added: 'It's a great chance to get away from real life, have some fun and see some of the stars.

An Arizona high school student has been suspended after driving to school with the Confederate flag flying from his truck. Jacob Green, 17, insists he is not a racist person and that flying the flag wasn’t a problem until a few weeks ago when another boy got into a fight with him. The Confederate flag has remained a controversial symbol since the Civil War and to this day still incites a lot of emotion. Scroll down for video... Jacob Green: The high school student displayed a confederate flag on his truck sparking a fight which resulted in the suspension of both himself and another boy . Some call it a symbol of hate from an era that preached segregation among Americans. After the fight, both boys at the school in Goodyear were suspended. Jacob has been banned from displaying the flag on campus but he has argued that the school has violated his first amendment rights to freedom of speech. The school district says it can limit students' rights while they're here on campus, especially when it comes to safety. Flying the flag: Some call it a symbol of hate from an era that preached segregation among Americans, but the flag sparked a fight at a high school and the district suspended both boys involved . The 13 stars of the Confederate flag represent the southern states who attempted secession from the United States during the Civil War, and where slavery was legal. The Confederate States set up a government from 1861 to 1865, but were eventually defeated by northern states in the U.S. Civil War. The 13 stars on the Confederates Flag represent the states of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri. In an email to parents following the incident, school officials explained that both students were suspended for five days and that Jason was prohibited from bringing the flag on campus. ‘Open display.. bringing it in.. it has . been proven to be patently offensive to certain groups and the courts . recognize that,’ said Agua Fria Unified School District Superintendent . Dennis Runyan. Historically, the flag has been known to symbolize a time of oppression and racism, but the 11th grader at Millennium High School says he has a different view of the flag. ‘I'm not a racist person,’ said Jacob Green to Fox News ‘I've done nothing wrong. I've flown a flag on my truck. Somebody fought me because of it.  I didn't fight him.  I was walking around like a normal person.  He confronted me, he hit me first.. I was defending myself,’ he explained. Jacob claims that the flag wasn't a problem until a couple of weeks ago when he and another boy got into a fight at school. Controversial: Historically, the flag has been known to symbolize a time of oppression and racism . Jacob says he researched the history of the Confederate flag and didn't find it offensive. ‘The flag means basically more independence, less government.  It didn't mean racism, it didn't mean slavery, it didn't mean any of that. It basically meant what they were fighting for was their right to be independent and not have the government control them.’ Jacob has so far refused to remove the flag from his car. His parents also back him saying that they believe their son should  have the right to fly the flag at school. They also believe the student who attacked their son committed a hate crime and are considering filing a police report . Either way, the school believes the flag to be a source of trouble and Jacob won’t be allowed to return to campus until he changes his mind.","Student flew flag from his pick-up truck .

U.S. Marine Jeff Fangman may have needed a bigger boat for his catch - had he not hooked a Great White shark right from the beach. Fangman, a combat engineer and avid angler, was fishing off Camp Pendleton in San Diego, California, with his wife and baby daughter in late October when suddenly his line started rolling off the reel. Luckily, his wife, Aldrei, had a camera on hand and caught it all on video. Scroll down for video . Deadliest catch: U.S. Marine Jeff Fangman was . fishing with his family off Camp Pendleton, California, when he snagged a Great White shark . Quite the catch: The fishing enthusiast caught the beast on a chunk of stingray and briefly dragged her out . Sizing her up: The shark was a young female measuring 9 and a half feet in length . She's got a mouth on her: Fangman posed with his fishy trophy, propping open her mouth to reveal several rows of serrated teeth . 'Lo and behold, it ended up being a Great White,' Fangman later told 10News. The gunnery master sergeant is an experienced fisherman, but this was his first Great White shark. 'Seeing it in the water was just, it was almost mind blowing,' he said. 'It's taken several weeks to get the whole ordeal to sink in.' Aldrei Fangman's video and still photos posted on her husband's Facebook page show the Marine hauling the sleek grey beast onto the sand by the tail. The shark measured nine-and-a-half feet in length - likely a young female - with rows of razor-sharp, serrated teeth clearly visible in its open maw. Family fishing trip: Fangman was on the beach with his wife, Aldrei (left) and baby daughter when he caught the Great White . Patience rewarded: Fangman was fishing for about two hours when suddenly something heavy tugged on his line . Given that it is illegal to catch Great Whites, Fangman was forced to drag the deadly predator back into the surf and let her go. Fangman's impressive feat likely marks the first time that an angler hooked a Great White from the beach in the U.S. The Marine, who just moved to California from Texas, said that hooking, dragging the beast out and then returning her into the ocean took him some 25 minutes - and he was exhausted by the end. ‘Just still kind of elated about the moment,’ he recalled. Trailblazer: Fangman is likely the first angler in the U.S. to catch a Great White from the beach . Law-abiding citizen: it is illegal to target Great White sharks in the U.S., so Fangman released the critter back . into the ocean after posing with her . This was not Fangman's first shark: he has pulled bull sharks, tiger sharks, lemon and sandbar sharks, but never a Great White. All that, however, changed on October 27, when he, wife Aldrei, their daughter and pet dog took a trip to the beach. Armed with chunks of stingray as bait, CBS8 reported, Fangman stood on the beach with his fishing pole for two hours with little to show for it until he felt a tug on the line. ‘I didn't realize it was a Great White while I was catching it, but I knew it was something heavy,’ he said. At one point toward the end of the video posted on Fangman’s YouTube channel, the Marine coolly opens the shark's mouth, revealing the fearsome jaws. Born free: About 30 minutes after the shark first grabbed the bait, the angler led her back into the deep and watched her swim away . Fangman noted in the description of the video that ‘in no way shape or form is it legal to specifically target Great Whites.' He added: 'this shark was not targeted and was released in a timely manner.' Fangman said the man-eating fish was very calm as he led her back into the deep.","Jeff Fangman caught 9-and-a-half foot young female shark off Camp Pendleton, California, using chunk of stingray .

A bride has been arrested for allegedly charging her $50,000 luxury wedding to her employers' credit cards. La'Reese Michelle Darville, 31, was jailed on fraud and grand theft charges on Monday, five months after she married husband Darell at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida. She has been accused of charging bills from the wedding to credit cards in the names of her bosses at a pawn shop - including her father. She only allegedly had permission to charge $10,000. Police began an investigation after one of the owners of Partners III Pawn Shop in Port St. Lucie received late payment notices for a credit card the company had not used for two years. Lavish: La'Reese Darville is pictured with her husband Darelle at their June wedding at a Florida Hard Rock Casino. La'Reese has now been arrested for allegedly using her employer's credit cards to cover the costs . At the store, police spoke with two other owners who said that Darville, their operations manager, takes care of their finances. One company credit card was $10,000 over its limit and another had been charged $28,000, according to a Port St. Lucie police report, the Palm Beach Post reported. The charges included payments to wedding photographers and planners and for renting the casino. Darville's father, Leroy Felix, said he knew nothing of the charges. Arrest: She insisted it was a 'huge misunderstanding' and that she intended to pay it back . When quizzed over the payments, Darville . acknowledged using the cards for her wedding but blamed it on her . father, who she claimed had told her to use the credit cards. Police say the $10,000 charged on her father's . credit card occurred after he gave his permission, but Darville did not have . permission to charge $39,286.24 to other accounts. Speaking to police, she allegedly admitted to using the account 14 times for her wedding but that she intended on repaying the business in full. She said she had already paid back more than $17,000 - although she had no record of it. Photographs taken of the big day reveal lavish touches, from rose petals lining the aisle and an arch of white flowers showcasing their wedding cake. Guests watched the ceremony in the casino's grand ballroom before partying at a reception and dinner that ended at midnight. La'Reese was joined by nine bridesmaids wearing pink satin dresses and matching silver shoes, while her husband and his groomsmen wore matching white suits. Darville told the Palm Beach Post that the situation had been a huge misunderstanding. She said her father, Leroy Felix, a part owner of the business, gave her permission for the charges. She said her father had given her with a credit card number linked to the business. 'Caught': Police went to the business after one owner received late payment notices for a credit card the company had not used for two years. It emerged she had charged them nearly $50,000 . Wedding: Darville, left with two of her nine bridesmaids and right with her then-fiance, allegedly admitted to using the company's credit cards 14 times to make purchases for the wedding . 'It's been said, or worded, that the card was stolen,' Darville said. 'I called. He gave me the number and (said) use it. I used it and it was being paid back, so I have no idea what the whole big deal is about, but (certainly) it was a huge mix-up.' But local businesses employed for the wedding were less forgiving. 'I just can’t imagine what was going through her brain that day,' said their photographer Sara Kauss. 'She should have worked hard and saved up and then planned this wedding.' Darville said she recently left the company and is now a stay at-home mother. She has now been released from the St. Lucie County Jail on $,7,500 bail. Business: She worked at this St Lucie, Florida pawn shop, where her father also works. She blamed the expenses on her father, telling police that he had given his permission for her to use the cards .","La'Reese Darville married husband Darell at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida in June .

Jurors in the fraud trial of Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi's former personal assistants have today been told to 'ignore' David Cameron after he declared he was a secret fan of the chef. The Prime Minister admitted in an interview that he is a member of . #TeamNigella - which is used by those rooting for the Domestic Goddess in her very public battle . with ex-husband Charles Saatchi. Mr Cameron yesterday brushed aside her admission that she had . snorted cocaine and smoked cannabis, hailing her as a ‘very funny and . warm person’ who creates good recipes. But his comments led to him becoming embroiled in the ongoing trial at Isleworth Crown Court, with the judge saying the Prime Minister caused this morning's proceedings to be 'wasted'. Backing: David Cameron has revealed he is supporting TV cook Nigella Lawson in her public battles with her husband, but a judge in her staff's fraud trial has criticised him for his comments . Thanks: Miss Lawson has used the hashtag #Team Nigella to thank her supporters, and offer a recipe for Holiday Hotcake . Justice Robin Johnson told jurors in . the trial of Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo it was 'of regret' when . public figures commented about someone involved in a trial and urged . them to only decide the case based on the evidence in court. Public criticism: Judge Robin Johnson today said that it was 'of regret' that David Cameron had commented on the row between Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi . Elisabetta . Grillo, referred to as Lisa, 41, and sister Francesca, 35, of . Bayswater, west London, each deny a single . count of committing fraud by using a company credit card for personal . gain between January 1, 2008, and December 31 last year. The sisters are accused of abusing their positions by spending . £685,000 on credit cards belonging to the celebrity couple to buy . designer goods and luxury holidays for themselves. The judge says their legal team claims the siblings are 'aggrieved' by Cameron's comments. The problems have been sparked after the Primer Minister was asked by the Spectator if he was a member of #TeamNigella, and Mr Cameron admitted: ‘I am.’ He . went on: ‘I’m a massive fan, I’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her . a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm . person. ‘But I’m also an . amateur cook and I like her recipes. Nancy [Cameron’s nine-year-old . daughter] and I sometimes watch a bit of Nigella on telly. Not in court, . I hasten to add.’ Judge Robin Johnson told jurors at Isleworth Crown Court the comments were 'regrettable' and directed the jury of seven men and five women to ignore the comments and to only focus on the evidence they have heard in open court. He said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, the reason for delay is I have been taken to a large number of press reports. 'They centre on the Prime Minister commenting about a prosecution witness, Ms Lawson, during an interview with a journalist. 'It is of regret when people in public office comment about a person who is involved in a trial that is in progress. 'It is inconceivable that some of your number may not have seen some of those comments. Team Nigella: Miss Lawson's team of lawyers, PRs and family who supported her as she gave evidence at Isleworth Crown Court . 'The defendants feel aggrieved as a result of the comments, though they do not specifically deal with matters in this trial, are favourable to Ms Lawson. 'The fact that they may feel aggrieved, the defendants, is not without justification. 'You'll realise that what public figures may feel about this case or a witness in this case, can have no bearing on the issues that you have to decide. 'Please use the written direction I gave you.' Businessman Charles Saatchi who has been locked in a bitter and very public dispute with his ex-wife Miss Lawson . He directed jurors concentrate 'on the evidence, and submissions and the legal directions. 'All this material, you'll hear in this room and nowhere else.' He added: 'Jurors are trusted to follow the judge's directions and I trust you'll do that.' Apologising for wasting the court's morning on legal argument, he added: 'I'm sorry that it has had the effect of wasting almost all of the morning that should have been devoted to evidence and real issues in this case.' It is not clear if Mr Cameron has . taken Miss Lawson up on her offer on Twitter of the recipe for Holiday . Hotcake, which she described as 'the perfect receip to show tanks for . all your support and to those who hashtag #TeamNigella'. Happier times: Nigella and Charles Saatchi before they split back in June after an incident at Scott's restaurant in central London . On trial: Italian sisters Elisabetta (left) and Francesca Grillo who are accused of a £685,000 credit card fraud using Charles Saatchi's company credit cards . Last . week, Ms Lawson admitted taking cocaine with ex-husband John Diamond . when he found out he had terminal cancer, and on another occasion in . July 2010 during her troubled marriage to Mr Saatchi. The 53-year-old also admitted smoking cannabis in the last year of her marriage to the art gallery owner but said the idea that she is a 'drug addict or habitual user of cocaine is absolutely ridiculous'. Giving evidence on the witness stand, Miss Lawson admitted to taking drugs in front of her children. Ms Lawson spoke of suffering 'intimate terrorism' at the hands of her multi-millionaire ex-husband, describing him as a 'brilliant, but brutal man'. She accused him of 'peddling' stories about her alleged drug habit, including that he was checking her nose for cocaine when he was photographed gripping her throat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London, in June. Charles Saatchi earlier told the court he still ‘absolutely adores’ ex-wife Nigella Lawson, was ‘very upset’ over claims she took cocaine and denies ‘gripping, strangling or throttling’ her outside a restaurant. Instead, in the infamous incident captured on camera – which led to the couple’s divorce – he claimed he was simply ‘holding her head, by the neck, to get her to focus’. Miss Lawson, he revealed, was unhappy in their marriage because she felt she needed to ask him for a ‘pass’ to do what she wanted. The trial continues.

The 29-year-old royal and the other adventurers were nearing the end of their gruelling 200-mile trek across Antarctica with their goal almost in sight. Harry, who is patron of the Walking With The Wounded expedition, said: ‘A half day on Friday and we get to the South Pole on Friday 13th - unlucky for some, lucky for us.

I think everyone is feeling a bit tired but slowly getting into the rhythm. Only just got into the rhythm now and it has almost finished.’ Harry said spirits are high after the decision to suspend the competitive element of the trek. He was part of a British group racing to the South Pole against teams from the Commonwealth and the US. But the competition was stopped over the weekend after some of the adventurers, who include injured servicemen and women, became very tired after encountering difficult terrain. Ed Parker, the expedition's director and co-founder of the WWTW charity that organised the challenge, said: ‘Everyone is beginning to get quite excited, we can see the end in sight now.

It feels very special that this group of people is finally on the cusp of achieving our aim.’ In a voice blog recorded in the frozen waste and released yesterday, Harry said: ‘Everyone is in really high spirits. The race obviously got cancelled a couple of days ago - a really good thing that has happened.’ Looking ahead to reaching their goal, Harry highlighted fellow adventurer Duncan Slater who lost both his legs when an improvised explosive device blew up in his vehicle in Afghanistan in 2009. Happy: Prince Harry said spirits are high after the decision to suspend the competitive element of the trek . He said: ‘Everyone just can't wait to get to the end. I think mixed emotions probably, I think some people, for instance Duncan, double amputee, simply doesn't find walking to the South Pole a big enough challenge, which is why he really enjoyed the race. 'I think everyone back home will appreciate the fact that just being able to walk 100km in these conditions with no legs is a pretty amazing feat in itself' Prince Harry . ‘I think everyone back home will appreciate the fact that just being able to walk 100km (62 miles) in these conditions with no legs is a pretty amazing feat in itself.’ In total, 12 injured service personnel who have overcome life-changing injuries are taking part in the expedition organised by the charity Walking With The Wounded.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:48 EST, 15 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:11 EST, 15 November 2013 . Speech: Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff wants to take the argument for a United States of Europe 'to the streets' Liberal Democrats should use next year’s Euro elections to campaign for a United States of Europe, a senior MEP has urged. In a rallying cry to pro-federalists, Andrew Duff will tell an audience in Berlin tomorrow that David Cameron is wrong to try to claw back powers and instead argue Britain must hand even more control and money to Brussels. Standing down as President of the Union of European Federalists, he will also insist there is ‘nothing inherently undemocratic’ about the way the EU is run at the moment. Mr Duff, an MEP for the East of England, will claim that next year’s elections to the European Parliament are ‘crunch time’ to ‘campaign for the federal Europe which we espouse’. The extraordinary pitch to voters comes at a time when the anti-EU UK Independent Party is expected to top the polls in Britain. Pro-federalists have to persuade the ‘those who hold the reins of national power to realise their relative impotence’, Mr Duff will say. But he does have the self-awareness to admit that ‘it would be naive for those of us who wish to strengthen the firepower of the EU to expect to be loved for what we do and say’. He adds: ‘The federalist argument has to be won not just in academic and official circles, and with the markets, but also democratically, even on the streets.’ In a speech to the 24th also takes aim at Mr Cameron, who has vowed to claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. ‘The rise of nationalist forces, and so-called ""eurosceptics"" who march to the beat of the nationalist drum, has continued,’ Mr Duff will say. ‘David Cameron may be able to peddle his defeatist prospectus of a weaker, looser confederation of nation states; but we now have our optimistic prospectus of a strong, democratic federal union of states and citizens. ‘Already the temptation to disintegrate, to dismantle what has been achieved over the last decades, risks overwhelming the United Kingdom.’ Instead Mr Duff calls for the UK government to give up more of its public spending and hand it to the ‘European treasury’. He . goes on to call for a ‘general revision’ of all EU treaties with a view . to restoring ‘full democratic legitimacy to the project of building a . united Europe’. Struggle: Mr Duff argues Britain and other national governments must hand more power and money to European treasury . The remarks were quickly condemned by UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who told MailOnline: 'We should never forget that despite how discredited the political and economic reality has shown their ideas to be, EU nationalists like Andrew Duff are still pushing for a United States of Europe. 'UKIP will be aiming to win the European Elections next year and we will seek to replace as many pro-EU, pro-Euro MEPs from the old parties as possible with UKIP MEPs who stand up and say that Britain must leave the EU.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'Andrew Duff is well known for his outspoken views on this issue. He was speaking in a personal capacity and definitely does not represent official party policy. 'Liberal Democrats will be pushing for a more accountable and efficient EU in 2014, focused on creating jobs and growth.' In extracts of his speech released today, Mr Duff complains that national elected governments have demanded financial belt-tightening ‘without stopping to consider for one moment the real added value and cost efficiencies which could be gained by a genuine transfer of some public spending from the national to the European budget and treasury’. Pledge: David Cameron has promised to negotiate a fresh settlement with Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by 2017 . Mr Duff warns that pro-federalists are ‘not very good at combating’ the people who blame Brussels for problems, but hails the controversial Lisbon Treaty as a ‘large step forward’ in the governance of the EU. Mr Duff will say: ‘In my view, there is nothing inherently undemocratic about any of the institutions of the European Union and nothing particularly malevolent about those who run them. ‘The greater problem is the absence of government   by which I mean an efficacious executive authority with the capacity to act across the wide range of topics which today's challenges throw up, and an executive authority possessing an armoury of instruments sufficient to deal with the complex challenge of integration.’ Despite the Eurozone crisis and austerity sweeping the continent, European unity has survived intact, he will say. ‘Not covered in glory, not making great strides to the federal constitutional settlement which we at UEF want to see. ‘Not without social hardship, particularly among the young, not without losing out in international affairs   but nevertheless the semblance of unity and the basic structure of the European Union has survived.’ However he warns of further unrest as the Eurozone battles to restore stability to the banking sector. ‘Imagine the political reaction when 'Brussels' starts to punish share-holders and depositors by closing down banks not just in Cyprus but also here in Germany.’","MEP Andrew Duff says next year's Euro elections are 'crunch time'

A gift firm has come under fire for selling mints that look like Breaking Bad's crystal meth - dubbing them 'crystal menth'. Online retailer Firebox is advertising its 'Blue Sky Candy' - which comes in 130g (4.5oz) bags - for £7.99. It claims the peppermints are '99.1 per cent pure' and compares them to methamphetamine, a highly addictive, crystal-like drug. Scroll down for video .

It also admits to using cult TV series Breaking Bad - which prominently features crystal meth dealers - as inspiration for the blue-coloured product. On its website, Firebox boasts: 'Cooked up in the Firebox lab under strictly controlled conditions, Blue Sky Candy is authentic looking peppermint rock candy inspired by the hit series Breaking Bad. 'Coming in at 99.1% chemically pure, we’re manufacturing some serious weight, allowing us to offer these 4.5oz bags at street value. 'So break off a chunk and enjoy some quality crystal menth… just don’t tell the narcos.' Awareness: The cult TV series has brought metheamphetamine - a highly addictive drug - to public attention . At the bottom of the website, it notes: 'This is NOT actually crystal meth'.

She told The Sun: 'Trivialising this drug is ultimately irresponsible as it takes one further step towards normalising what can be catastrophic substance use.' Breaking Bad, which saw its finale attract a staggering 10.3million viewers in September, has brought metheamphetamine into the public consciousness. The multi award-winning drama follows the life of chemistry teacher Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, who, after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, starts making crystal meth to secure his family's future. Firebox has refused to comment. Methamphetamine - often referred to as 'crystal meth' - is a highly addictive drug that stimulates the brain and nervous system. It is Class A drug - with those in possession of it risking up to seven years in jail and/or an unlimited fine. Supplying the substance can result in life imprisonment. Even in small doses, methamphetamine can increase wakefulness and physical activity, while decreasing appetite. Illegal: Class A drug methamphetamine - or 'crystal meth' - is one of the world's most addictive substances . It can also cause a variety of cardiovascular problems, including rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeat and increased blood pressure.

A Georgia mother who claimed a group of armed robbers broke into her home, assaulted her autistic daughter and then 'stole Christmas' made up the elaborate tale, police said Thursday night. Jordan Davis told authorities and even spun a story to the media that she and her disabled six-year-old daughter, Jade, were threatened, terrorized and robbed Wednesday night in their south DeKalb home. But, after an extensive investigation Thursday, DeKalb County Police Capt. Steven Fore said there was no evidence to prove the crime ever happened and Davis later confessed to the hoax. Scroll down for video . Hoax: Jordan Davis, pictured, claimed a group of armed robbers broke into her home, assaulted her autistic six-year-old daughter and then 'stole Christmas' but police said she made up the tale . 'Evidence at the scene did not support the crime that allegedly took place,' Fore told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'After speaking with her, (investigators) were able to determine that no one actually ever entered the residence and the child was never assaulted.' Fore said Davis didn't reveal why she lied about the break in, though he suggested she may have been trying to take advantage of the generosity of the community around the holidays. He said his office was bombarded with members of the community asking how they could help after the bandits apparently 'stole' the family's Christmas. 'We really don't have any definite motivation as to why she made up the story,' Fore said. Daughter: Davis told police she and her autistic daughter, Jade, pictured, were the victims of a group of thugs who broke into their home, beat up the child and then made off with all their Christmas presents . Husband: Jordan Davis and her husband, pictured, are expected to be charged in the hoax . 'The outcry of support from the community has been overwhelming. This really, I would think, would hurt the good will of other people when they see stories like this.' The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also had an influx of readers asking how they could assist the family, the newspaper revealed. Davis is being held at the DeKalb police headquarters as officials try to find a family member to care for her daughter. The woman and her husband will be charged with crimes in the hoax. Davis told police she and her autistic daughter were the victims of a group of thugs who broke into their home, beat up the child and then made off with all their Christmas presents. She explained that the gang of masked men broke into her home by smashing through a dining room window with a cinder block about 7 pm -- just after her husband left to make a trip to the store. Burglary: DeKalb County police were investigating the mother's claim that she and her 6-year-old daughter were threatened and terrorized at the above home, pictured, but found no evidence . Davis said she and Jade, who also suffers from epilepsy, were in an upstairs bedroom when the men stormed into their home. 'I heard a crash, and then I heard a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,' Davis told WSBTV. 'It was the intruders coming up the stairs.' As the men ransacked the house, Davis said her daughter - who is unable to speak - 'was of course crying.' Davis said that at least one of the men had a gun and another had a knife during the attack, and that they forced her and the girl into a closet as they looked for valuables. At one point, Davis said, one of the intruders kicked the young, disabled girl in the side and then 'picked her up by her hair and held a gun to her right temple and told me . to give them everything I have or he would kill her,' Davis said. 'It . was real scary for everybody. Broken window: The intruder broke through the window, pictured, of the home, the mother said. It is assumed she and her husband smashed it themselves . The armed thieves rummaged through the girl's room looking for valuables, Davis said, taking items including clothes, the girl's seizure medication and medical equipment the girl uses to communicate. Then, Davis said, they stole the family's Christmas presents and fled. 'They just stole Christmas from us,' Davis told Channel 2. 'It's sad.' It was reported that Jade suffered bruised ribs in the attack and was examined at a local hospital before she was released Thursday. It's unclear how this occurred.","Jordan Davis told police that armed thugs broke into her house shortly after her husband left the home .

A man who sold a broken record player after clearing out his loft will not have a Blue Christmas this year, because it used to belong to Elvis. Jim Jenkins and his wife Ellen were given the Ebner Musical 5v Luxus by the King of Rock 'n' Roll as a wedding present, when he was stationed in Germany in the early part of his army service from 1958 to 1959. The gift was intended as a thank you to German Mrs Jenkins, who had helped the music pioneer's father Vernon with translation. The record player (pictured) owned by Elvis Presley during his time in the US Army in Germany made £4,400 at auction this week . Mrs Jenkins had visited the Presley's hotel apartment several times to speak to Elvis at length, as well as going to parties where he would play records and his guitar on the Luxus. In 1959 the hotel asked him to leave because of complaints from other residents. The record player broke, and was left to gather dust in the loft at the couple's home when they retired to Cornwall in 1989. Ellen Jenkins (left), told Elvis that she was about to marry an Englishman and move to Britain so he gave her the Perpetuum Ebner Musical 5v Luxus player (right) as a wedding present . This week the historical item sold for £4,400 and Mr Jenkins, who is not an Elvis fan, could not be happier. He said: 'We used it at parties. It had a great sound. But the needle broke so I put it away in the loft thinking I would fix it one day.' And retired Mr Jenkins said that the only reason he didn't throw away the turntable is that he saw Elvis using an identical one in a newspaper article. Jim Jenkins is not an Elvis fan, and is delighted that the record player has sold for such a high price, even though it is broken . In fact, Mr Presley had used the same player that he gave to the couple as an amplifier when using his guitar. The Luxus had three record speeds for singles and long players and a . built in amplifier which helped Elvis relive the sound that his fans . heard. Mr Jenkins sold the record player at David Lay’s Penzance Auction House in west Cornwall. The winning bid - twice the estimate - was online and the player will be heading back to Germany. Auctioneer David Lay said: 'I have never come across anything that has created so much excitement. 'We got a lot of interest from Germany.'

The wife of Kyle Van Winkle, the Missouri man who was found dead outside the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium has said that since his death at the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium she has been living a nightmare - while his police officer father denied his son was drunk. Jenni Van Winkle, the mother of their seven-week-old son Will said that every day has become a living nightmare as she waits for investigators to establish exactly what killed her husband who was found unconscious on December 1 and whose death has been ruled a homicide. 'It's completely senseless. I can't even wrap my mind around it sometimes,' Van Winkle's wife, Jenni, told ABC News. 'I wake up every single day with the same nightmare.' Scroll Down for Video . Grief: Jenni Van Winkle has described every day since her husband's death as a nightmare as her father-in-law - Dean (right) said he doesn't believe his son was drunk the night he die . 'I try to move forward and I get up and I take care of Will because I know that's just what Kyle would want and unfortunately my life, now, is a reality that I never thought that I would have to be in'. Indeed, according to his father, police sergeant Dean Van Winkle, his son was not intoxicated when he left his seat during the NFL game to go to the restroom. Van Winkle, 30, died after a fight with the man who owned the green jeep he broke into in the parking lot of the stadium during the Chiefs game. 'I was with him from start to finish that day at the tailgating. Most everybody in our group had some kind of drinks,' Van Winkle said. 'If I had thought he was intoxicated or in trouble I would have followed him.' Tragic: Kyle Van Winkle, 30, of Smithville, Mo., was found unconscious outside Arrowhead Stadium Dec. 1 while the Kansas City Chiefs were playing the Denver Broncos . The owner of the jeep found Van Winkle inside his car and a struggle ensued - during which Van Winkle collapsed and died. The police were called to the parking lot of Arrowhead Stadium at around 5.20 pm and Van Winkle was rushed to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Four people were taken into custody for questioning following the incident, but no one was charged. 'There's just too much unknown there, so it makes it difficult for everybody but it's also something I recognize as some of this may never be figured. I certainly don't have the answers,' Dean Van Winkle said.

New dad: Kyle Van Winkle with his son Will - who was born seven weeks ago and who has now lost his father . The Kansas City Star reports that police are focusing their investigation on a 24-year-old tailgater as Van Winkle's primary attacker. Detectives searched the man's home and arrested him - though he has not been formally charged and his name has not been released. Van Winkle, the 30-year-old son of a Missouri police sergeant and a new father, died in the parking lot of Arrowhead Stadium Sunday after he left the Chiefs-Denver Brocos game. His family says he got into an unlocked dark-colored Jeep in the parking lot that looked nearly identical to one of the vehicles his friend drove to the game. It was in the same row as his friend's vehicle - but 10 cars away. When the owner of the Jeep arrived at his car with his 10-year-old son and found Van Winkle inside, he called for help - believing he had broken into the vehicle, according to police. Deadly struggle: Three men were taken in custody after a man died during a vicious parking lot brawl near this Jeep on Sunday night . The men reportedly brawled in the parking lot at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City (pictured) last night .

One tailgater in particular, the 24-year-old who is now a suspect, showered Van Winkle with blows until he was unconscious, according to police. Someone propped him up, unconscious against a bus. The 24-year-old assailant and his friends went back to their tailgate party. The Jeep owner and his son left. An unknown amount of time later, a bystander noticed that Van Winkle was turning blue.

President Barack Obama said Saturday he believed the chances for a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran are 50-50 or worse, yet defended diplomacy as the best way to prevent Tehran from acquiring atomic weapons. During a question-and-answer session with a pro-Israel audience, Mr Obama said he wasn't naive about the odds for a successful final agreement between world powers and Iran next year, building on the recent six-month interim deal. 'If you ask me what is the likelihood that we're able to arrive at the end state ... I wouldn't say that it's more than 50-50,' Mr Obama said. 'But we have to try.' Candid: President Barack Obama spoke openly about his skepticism that Iran will keep its word . The president's remark was somewhat startling. Obama has tried to allay the fears of many Israelis and some Americans that his administration last month promised to ease economic pressure too much in return for too few Iranian concessions. The comment nevertheless pointed to the difficult talks that await as the U.S. and its negotiating partners - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - work toward a final pact next year. The goal is to eliminate the possibility of Iran assembling a nuclear arsenal, even if any deal might let Iran continue enriching uranium at lower levels not easily convertible into weapons-grade material. Mr Obama said the six-month interim agreement halts and rolls back central elements of Iran's nuclear program, compelling Tehran to eliminate higher-enriched uranium stockpiles, stop adding new centrifuges and cease work at a heavy water reactor that potentially could produce plutonium. It also provides time to see if the crisis can be averted through negotiation. 'If at the end of six months it turns out we can't make a deal,' Mr Obama said, 'we are no worse off.' Sanctions against Iran will be fully reinstated and even tightened if Iran doesn't make a final agreement, he pledged. Mr Obama's appearance at the Brookings Institution forum appeared directed as much at an Israeli audience as an American one. The discussion was broadcast live on Israeli television, with analysts there viewing it as an effort to patch over Mr s public differences with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unhappy with the deal: Israel's Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets in Jerusalem earlier this week with US Secretary of State John Kerry . Mr Netanyahu, who was scheduled to address the same forum Sunday, has called the nuclear agreement in Geneva the 'deal of the century' for Iran. In an appearance Friday, his foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, repeated Israel's objections. Mr Obama acknowledged some 'significant tactical disagreements' with Mr Netanyahu, but said U.S. and Israeli bottom-line goals were the same. Secretary of State John Kerry promised close consultation on next steps with the Jewish state, which includes a visit to Washington this coming week by Yossi Cohen, Mr Netanyahu's national security adviser. 'We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon - period - not now, not ever,' Mr Kerry said. 'I am convinced that we have taken a strong first step that has made the world and Israel safer.' Beyond Israel, Sunni Arab countries have expressed concerns about what America's Iran engagement might mean for the balance of power in the region with Shiite-dominate Iran. Saudi Arabian officials even have talked about their own potential nuclear ambitions. Echoing Mr Obama's effort to reach out to concerned allies, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel renewed a U.S. push for the sale of missile defense technology and other weapons systems to U.S.-friendly Gulf nations to counter the threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. Seems so long ago: Mr Kerry between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabiu during the Iran nuclear deal announcement just last month . In a speech Saturday in Bahrain, Mr Hagel made clear that any final deal on Iran's nuclear program wouldn't end the threat posed by a country the U.S. considers the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. On Mideast peace hopes, Mr Obama echoed an optimistic assessment provided by Mr Kerry during a trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories this past week. The president said his administration had spent much time working with Mr Netanyahu to understand Israel's security needs as part of any two-state solution. Over the next several months to arrive at a framework that does not address every single detail but gets us to the point where everybody recognizes it's better to move forward than move backward,"" Obama said. Still, he said tough decisions await both sides, including the Palestinians' understanding a transition period will be necessary so no situation arises similar to Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip after Israel's 2005 military pullout. 'The Israeli people cannot expect a replica of Gaza in the West Bank,' Mr Obama said. 'That is unacceptable.'","Despite the negative tone, President Barack Obama still defended diplomacy as the best course of action .

Smiling staff handed out commemorative model planes to passengers on the flight as dozens of golf carts circulated the lounge to give free rides for anyone in need.

The only US destination is Anchorage in Alaska - and those flights are all cargo deliveries by UPS and Federal Express - while there is only one direct flight to Europe from Chongqing, and that’s Finnair’s service to Helsinki.

But foreign interest mostly concerns the country's major cities and tthe expected surge of connections from Europe to large 'secondary cities' in China has not materialised, reported the Independent.","Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport's Terminal 3 opened yesterday with much fanfare and a flight to Mongolia .
It cost £612m, covers a staggering 4.3million square feet and can handle 45million passengers a year .
Designed by the Rome-based architect Studio Fuksas, it looks like vast white, honeycomb aeroplane .
It is also China's first airport with a 10-megawatt solar power plant that could power 10,000 US homes .
Also a Soviet aviation museum, Minsk World, and another about Britain's 'colonialist invasion' of the Opium Wars .
But the only European airline with flights from the airport is Finnair with one trip to capital Helsinki .
And the only flights to the US are cargo planes to Anchorage in Alaska ."
"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:58 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:54 EST, 2 December 2013 . The Obama administration has forcefully denied that it is quietly exploring the possibility of a presidential visit to Iran in 2014, despite weekend news reports that originated with a newspaper in Kuwait. The White House quickly pooh-poohed the idea late Monday morning, with National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden telling MailOnline in an email that 'there's no truth to this report.' 'I'll leave it to others to speculate on how rumors get started,' she said. She also declined to speculate on whether the White House might accept an offer to visit Tehran if the initial news report were a trial balloon to gauge the administration's likely response. 'I’m not ... going to comment on hypothetical situations,' Hayden added. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani (C) got a hero's welcome when he returned home from the U.S. in September, with demonstrators chanting 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel' -- and 'Thank you Rouhani' Obama's last public statements on Iran came during a late-night Nov. 23 announcement of the terms of a nuclear deal with the Islamic republic. Iran later claimed the White House fabricated some of the details it released . National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden (L) was quick to dismiss any idea of Obama visiting Iran, which is still trying to shake its image as the state sponsor of a 444-day hostage crisis in the late 1970s . A . senior national security staffer who served in a Republican . administration told MailOnline that it would be an 'intensely foolish' move for the Obama team. 'The . only way he goes to Tehran is if he doesn't plan on coming back,' said . the former White House expert, who requested anonymity. 'Whatever people may think about the current occupant of the White House, I can't believe this possibility would ever be on the table.' The Arabic-language Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida reported on Friday that Obama 'is trying to arrange a visit to Tehran in the middle of next year.' 'The source said his desire for the visit is mutual,' the report read, according to an English translation obtained by MailOnline, 'and that both Tehran and Washington expect Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to invite his American counterpart to visit Tehran as soon as certain arrangements are concluded.' The Obama administration's . relationship with Iran has evolved in recent weeks, following that . nation's preliminary agreement to trim back some portions of its nuclear . program in exchange for a relaxation of economic sanctions. The Kuwaiti news outlet Al-Jarida cited an unnamed diplomatic source and reported that Obama is set to visit Iran next year . How would he explain it to Bibi? Obama's frosty relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be frayed to the breaking point if the White House were to green-light a friendly visit to Tehran . But while Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif mugged for cameras last month in Geneva and promised greater transparency, both Rouhani and Khamenei fed Iranians a steady diet of hard-line rhetoric. And Iranian leaders slammed the Obama White House last week for publishing what it termed a 'one-sided interpretation' of the agreement, later disagreeing with the White House's claim that it would forgo its 'absolute' right to enrich uranium. Iran also said last week that its controversial heavy-water reactor project would continue, a sign that it is developing a plutonium reactor most likely intended for producing weapons-grade nuclear material. The Al-Jarida report first surfaced on a blog published by The Weekly Standard. The confusion over Washington's relationship with Tehran comes as Iran has acknowledged that it will build a second nuclear reactor, which it claims is for peaceful purposes. The state-run FARS News Agency reported Sunday that a new facility would be built in the same province where it already has a function reactor, which Russia helps operate. The Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida published a report Friday, in Arabic, claiming that President Obama was planning a visit to Iran. Here is a translation provided to MailOnline by a fluent Arabic speaker: . Al-Jarida has learned from a U.S. diplomat that President Barack Obama is trying to arrange a visit to Tehran in the middle of next year. The source said his desire for the visit is mutual, and that both Tehran and Washington expect Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to invite his American counterpart to visit Tehran as soon as certain arrangements are concluded. He [the source] pointed out that the most significant detail remaining to be decided is whether there will be a meeting between Obama and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, or whether that meeting won't be held. The source said Obama was expecting the invitation, and planned to devote the trip to publicizing his administration's policy in the region, which is based on the principles of non-military involvement and harmony. He wants to be the first U.S. president to visit Iran since the Khomeini revolution, and to demonstrate that he is a champion of peaceful discussions, even with those who chant 'death to America.'","National Security Council spokeswoman flatly denies the report that a visit to Tehran is in the works .
