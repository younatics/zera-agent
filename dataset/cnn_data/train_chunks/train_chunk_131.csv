"(CNN) -- The United Kingdom will back French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde to become head of the International Monetary Fund, British Chancellor George Osborne said. The IMF is scheduled to begin accepting nominations for its top job Monday, following the resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who faces sexual assault charges in the United States. ""We support her because she's the best person for the job, but I also personally think it would be a very good thing to see the first female managing director of the IMF in its 60 year history,"" said Osborne, Britain's equivalent of a finance minister. Strauss-Kahn, who is accused of trying to rape a maid last week in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York, was released from Rikers Island jail on Friday and is staying with his wife, Anne Sinclair. He proclaimed innocence in a resignation letter to the IMF Executive Board late Wednesday. ""To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" he said. The IMF said Friday that it aims to complete the selection process by June 30. Lagarde is likely to face opposition from developing economies, who are proposing their own candidates for the post. Mexico will put forward Central Bank Chief Agustin Carstens as a candidate, the state-run news agency reported Sunday. Carstens worked with the IMF as the executive director for Mexico, Spain, Venezuela and Central America, and was later a deputy managing director there, Notimex said. Since the IMF was created in 1945, all 10 of the institution's managers have been European. Four of them have been French.

"London (CNN) -- A 15-year-old Ethiopian boy who came to Britain to take part in the Olympic torch relay and speaks little English has gone missing, police said Friday, prompting concern for his welfare. Natnael Yemane left his hotel in central Nottingham on Thursday night and has not been seen since, Nottinghamshire police said. ""We are concerned for Natnael as he does not speak very good English and is not thought to be street-wise,"" a police spokesman said. ""He does have family in London, but we need to find him and make sure he is safe and well."" Natnael, who took part in the torch relay Thursday, is described as black, 5 feet 8 inches tall, and of thin build. He has short hair and was last seen wearing faded dark jeans, a green and yellow camouflage hooded jacket, and black sneakers with a white stripe. A London 2012 representative said: ""A young boy of 15 has gone missing, and clearly this is of great concern to us. Everyone is doing all they can to find him and make sure he is safe."" Anyone who may have seen Natnael since Thursday night is urged to contact the police. Natnael was one of 20 young people picked for the London Olympics ""International Inspiration"" program, the Games organizers said. One torchbearer was selected from each of the 20 countries that are part of the program, from Azerbaijan to Zambia. International Inspiration, part of the ""legacy"" program of the London 2012 Olympics, ""inspires and enables millions of young people in countries around the world to play sport,"" according to the official website. Over the course of the 70-day relay, leading up to the July 27 opening ceremony, 8,000 runners will carry the Olympic flame 8,000 miles across the United Kingdom. Organizers say the flame will pass within 10 miles of 95% of the British population on the route.

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian military intelligence used the Red Cross emblem in a rescue operation in which leftist guerrillas were duped into handing over 15 hostages, according to unpublished photographs and video viewed by CNN. What seems to be part of a red cross is seen on a bib worn by a man involved in the rescue in this official image. Photographs of the Colombian military intelligence-led team that spearheaded the rescue, shown to CNN by a confidential military source, show one man wearing a bib with the Red Cross symbol. The military source said the three photos were taken moments before the mission took off to persuade the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  rebels to release the hostages to a supposed international aid group for transport to another rebel area. Such a use of the Red Cross emblem could constitute a ""war crime"" under the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law and could endanger humanitarian workers in the future, according to international legal expert Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association. ""It is clear that the conventions are very strict regarding use of the symbol because of what it represents: impartiality, neutrality. The fear is that any misuse of the symbol would weaken that neutrality and would weaken the [Red Cross],"" Ellis said. Watch possible misuse of emblem Â» . ""If you use the emblem in a deceitful way, generally the conventions say it would be a breach. [Based on the information as explained to me,] the way that the images show the Red Cross emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime, "" he added. The unpublished video and photos of the mission, hailed internationally as a daring success, were shown to CNN by a military source looking to sell the material. CNN declined to buy the material at the price being asked; it was therefore unable to verify the authenticity of the images. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and his top generals have categorically denied that international humanitarian symbols were used in the July 2 rescue mission that freed the prized hostages, who included former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and soldiers. The hostages had endured years of harsh captivity and deprivation in jungle camps since being captured or kidnapped. Some were held for as long as 10 years. The rescue ruse also included bogus communications, sent electronically and by human couriers, to convince FARC rebels that superiors were ordering them to hand over hostages to the group posing as aid workers for transfer to another rebel camp. On Monday, government and military spokesmen reiterated that all logos and emblems used in the operation had been invented and that no genuine symbols had been used. Misuse of the Red Cross emblem is governed by articles 37, 38 and 85 of Additional Protocol One to the Geneva Conventions, the international rules of war. The articles prohibit ""feigning of protected status by the use of ... emblems"" of neutral parties and say that such misuses are considered breaches of international humanitarian law that qualify as a ""war crime."" Colombia signed the Geneva Conventions in 1949. That prohibition was put in place to protect the neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations in an armed conflict and to guarantee their access to all sides. Use of those emblems by one side of a conflict, for example, could endanger aid workers because those on another side might no longer trust that symbols they see really represent those humanitarian organizations. An ICRC spokesman in Bogota said the organization had been in ""an ongoing confidential dialogue"" with the Colombian government about the report that the emblem may have been used in the operation. Among the photos shown to CNN are some bearing a date stamp of July 2, taken at an unidentified landing site in the jungle alongside a farm house. In one of those photographs, about 15 members of a Colombian military intelligence-led team pose for a photo alongside a helicopter. One of the members, dressed in a dark red T-shirt or polo shirt, khaki cargo pants and a black-and-white Arab-style scarf, also wears a bib of the type worn by Red Cross workers. The bib bears the Red Cross symbol in the center of two black circles on a white background. In the space between the two black circles appear in capital letters the French words ""Comite International Geneve"" (International Committee Geneva). The same man is standing in the doorway of the helicopter, a Russian-made MI-17 painted white and orange, in another photo. In a third photo, he is pictured walking near the helicopter still wearing the bib. The same man pictured in the photos can be seen fleetingly in a heavily edited video of the rescue mission issued to the media by the Defense Ministry two days after the hostages were freed. In one frame, part of what appears to be the Red Cross bib is visible as the man wearing it stands in a jungle clearing alongside guerrilla commanders Gerardo Antonio Aguilar, alias Cesar, and Alexander Farfan, known as Enrique Gafas, who were captured in the operation. The red blur of a Red Cross can be seen and part of the two black circles of the emblem and the capital letters ""EVE"". Those are also the last three letters of word Geneve (Geneva), which appears on the official ICRC emblem and bib. In two other frames of the officially released video, the same man, dressed in the same clothes as in the pre-departure photos, can be seen still wearing the predominantly white bib tied at the sides. In those shots the ICRC logo is not visible. The unpublished video also reveals an emblem that bears the Spanish words ""Mision Internacional Humanitaria"" (International Humanitarian Mission) and a stylized red bird made up of wavy red lines above two curved branches of blue leaves. In the 3Â½-minute video of the operation issued by the military, emblems pasted on the side of the rescue helicopter cannot be seen. But in the unpublished video and photos shown to CNN, emblems measuring about one square meter (one square yard) are pasted onto the outside of the chopper. The same emblem appears on the Web site for Mision Internacional Humanitaria, which describes itself as a non-governmental organization based in Barcelona, Spain, that ""works to improve the processes of development to guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals and peoples."" Although the site says the group is registered with the Spanish Interior Ministry and the regional Department of Justice, the site is littered with misspellings, and the telephone number that's listed is 000000000. CNN was unable to contact the group to verify its existence. The group's Web site could not be accessed early Tuesday. Additional video clips show how the emblems on the side of the helicopter were stripped off and burned once the rescue mission had been completed. The fate of the bib is not clear from the clips. In a brief statement Monday, the media spokesman for the Red Cross mission in Bogota reiterated that the group had not been officially involved in the rescue operation. ""The International Committee of the Red Cross cannot confirm that its logo and/or the Red Cross emblem were used,"" the spokesman said. ""The ICRC maintains an ongoing confidential dialogue with the Colombian authorities on a variety of humanitarian issues, including news reports that the Red Cross emblem may have been used in this operation."" Uribe, Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, armed forces chief Gen. Freddy Padilla and army chief Gen. Mario Montoya all categorically stated immediately after the rescue operation that no genuine international humanitarian emblems had been used or misused. In a nationally televised news conference, Uribe asked Betancourt whether she had seen any emblems on the helicopter that came to pick her and the other hostages up. She replied that she had not and that the lack of markings had puzzled her. ""After all these years of guerrilla war, we have become experts in identifying who is before us,"" she answered. ""That's why I said it was very strange to me. I said, 'Well, what is this? A helicopter, a white helicopter. Red Cross? No. France? No.' There was no flag. There was nothing; there was no sign anywhere."" In the official video released by the military, the man wearing what appeared to be a Red Cross bib is standing alongside Betancourt and another rescued hostage just before they board the rescue helicopter. That is in the part of the video in which the logo is blurred and not readily identifiable. Both of Colombia's two main guerrilla armies, the FARC and the smaller National Liberation Army, have been known to misuse the Red Cross symbol, sometimes transporting fighters in ambulances. The Colombian government frequently makes international denunciations of rebel violations of international humanitarian law. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world are highly respected international and national organizations, especially for their work in combat zones. Their statutes establish a position of strict neutrality in a conflict, which guarantees their ability to bring humanitarian aid to all sides in a conflict. Other national and international aid organizations do not have such strict rules on neutrality and operating procedures. International humanitarian law, partly enshrined in the Geneva Conventions, is seen as a systematic attempt to establish certain rules of war and limit the savagery of conflict. The laws seek to set clear distinctions between warring factions, neutral parties and civilians and what rights and responsibilities each of these has in a combat zone. Additional Protocol One and the articles referring to the misuse of international emblems technically refers to international armed conflicts. But signatory nations as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross also consider it a benchmark for internal conflicts, such as the four-decade-old war in Colombia. Other photos shown to CNN indicate how little was done to disguise equipment used in the rescue. The two military MI-17 helicopters used in the rescue were repainted white and orange without removing armor-plated panels positioned around the outside of the cockpit. Another shot shows the pilots wearing what appear to be military pilots' helmets that have been repainted white with orange or red V-shaped stripes. The helmets still have prominent mounts on the front used for attaching night vision goggles. One other video clip shows the two guerrilla commanders, who had boarded the helicopter with their hostages, carried out of the chopper over the shoulders of two men the CNN source identified as plain-clothes military personnel. The rebels were blindfolded and partially stripped. As they were dumped on the ground, they appeared groggy and stunned. Before the departure of the operation, two soldiers in camouflage uniforms can be seen on the farm where the helicopters were staged, chasing a chicken and stunning it with a stun gun.","Photos from miltary source show man wearing bib with Red Cross logo .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A group of county and city prosecutors in California have sued Walgreen Co., alleging that the drug store chain broke state laws when disposing of hazardous waste, medical waste and customer records. Prosecutors asked a judge this week to issue a preliminary injunction against the company. The county and city attorneys originally filed a lawsuit in June, asked a judge to stop the company from improperly disposing of waste and consider fining the company for allegedly violating state laws. ""This wasn't an isolated incident. Walgreen's actions were systematic and statewide, and the company must be held accountable,"" Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen A. Trutanich said in a statement Monday. A company spokesman declined to comment on details of the case. ""We intend to work with state and local officials in order to resolve this matter,"" Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin said in a written statement. The lawsuit, filed by 35 California district attorneys and two city attorneys, alleges that Walgreens stores improperly disposed of items like batteries, liquid corrosive waste, aerosol cans and pharmaceutical waste in company trash bins, sending them to local landfills rather than authorized disposal sites. The complaint also says Walgreens improperly disposed of customer records containing confidential medical information, failing to take required steps to protect privacy. The drug store chain should be fined, prosecutors say, under state health codes. ""Prosecutors contend that Walgreens systematically ignored those laws to cut costs,"" the Alameda County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. Walgreen Co. mentioned the lawsuit in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month, citing regulations that require the company to disclose proceedings where monetary sanctions could exceed $100,000. ""The company intends to work with state and local officials in an effort to resolve this matter, but cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts,"" the filing said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol's Jaqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.","Walgreens employees improperly disposed of materials, prosecutors say .

"New York (CNN) -- Counsel for international economist Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is jailed on sexual assault charges, filed a new appeal on Wednesday seeking his release on bail from Rikers Island. ""We respectfully submit that the following bail conditions ... eliminate any concern that Mr. Strauss-Kahn would or could leave this court's jurisdiction,"" wrote lawyer Shawn P. Naunton. He then said the International Monetary Fund chief had agreed to post $1 million in cash, to be confined to home detention in Manhattan with electronic monitoring, and to turn over his U.N. travel document. The appeal noted that the Frenchman has already surrendered his passport. A source close to the Strauss-Kahn defense told CNN's Jeffrey Toobin that a deal is in the works that could result in his being freed on bail as early as Thursday. The deal is tentative and could still fall through, but the defense was optimistic that Strauss-Kahn could be released soon. Strauss-Kahn's bail appeal to the state Supreme Court will be heard Thursday. It adds conditions that were not in the appeal turned down Monday by a criminal court judge and describes the accused as ""a loving husband and father, and a highly regarded international diplomat, lawyer, politician, economist and professor, with no prior criminal record."" It notes that he has been married for more than a decade and has four children from a prior marriage, one of whom lives in New York, where she is a graduate student at Columbia University. The case has captured worldwide attention. Strauss-Kahn is not only head of the IMF, but had been considered the French Socialist Party's best hope to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's elections. He is accused of sexual assault and the attempted rape of a 32-year-old Guinean maid in his Sofitel hotel suite. Prosecutors have opposed his release, asserting he is a flight risk. Meanwhile, the alleged victim was to testify Wednesday before a grand jury in Manhattan Criminal Court, according to her attorney. ""I want her to feel safe,"" said Jeffrey Shapiro. ""To the extent that his freedom would impair her feeling of safety, that would deeply concern me."" The woman, a widow who lives with her child in New York's borough of the Bronx, will deny the claim that the incident was consensual, Shapiro said. She has worked at the hotel for three years and is considered a good employee, the managing director of Sofitel said in a statement. ""Her world has been turned upside down,"" her attorney, Shapiro, said. ""She is very scared about her future."" Prosecutors allege that a naked Strauss-Kahn, 62, chased the housekeeping employee through his Manhattan hotel suite on Saturday and sexually assaulted her. But attorney Benjamin Brafman said during Strauss-Kahn's arraignment Monday that was not the case. ""The forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible account, and we believe there is a very, very defensible case,"" he said. The IMF chief faces an array of charges, including two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act, one count of first-degree attempted rape, one count of first-degree sexual abuse, one count of second-degree unlawful imprisonment, one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual abuse. ""He grabbed the victim's chest without consent, attempted to remove her pantyhose"" and forcibly grabbed her between her legs, the complaint against Strauss-Kahn says.  He also forced her to perform oral sex on him, Assistant District Attorney John McConnell said at the arraignment. Strauss-Kahn allegedly committed the offenses at noon, checked out of the hotel at 12:28 p.m. and went to a previously scheduled lunch about 12:45 p.m., according to a document supporting his motion to approve bail. The lunch was with his daughter, according to a source with knowledge of the case. After lunch, he was driven to John F. Kennedy International Airport and boarded an Air France flight that was scheduled to depart at 4:45 p.m., the bail document says. It adds that he had bought the ticket the week before. As Strauss-Kahn sat in a first-class seat awaiting takeoff and a planned meeting the next day with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, followed by a meeting with European finance ministers on Monday in Brussels, his world of luxury and power came crashing down. Police, alerted by hotel staff to the maid's accusations, ordered him off the plane and placed him in custody. The law enforcement source said Strauss-Kahn was examined for scratches and DNA samples were taken, and investigators searched for other evidence in the suite, including possible bodily fluids from both individuals. Strauss-Kahn consented to the testing after investigators were prepared to execute a search warrant, the source said. Forensic test results could be ready as soon as Strauss-Kahn's Friday court appearance. Last month, Strauss-Kahn discussed the possibility that a woman might falsely accuse him of attacking her. In an April 28 interview with the French daily newspaper Liberation, he imagined ""a woman who would be raped in a parking lot and who would then be promised 500,000 or a million euros to invent such a story,"" the paper reported in an article published Monday. Speaking to the paper about suggestions he could become France's Socialist Party candidate for president, Strauss-Kahn discussed ""the long -- too long from his point of view -- campaign to come and the difficulties he will have to overcome,"" the paper reported. ""He sees three in the following order: 'Money, women and my Jewishness.' ""  He added, ""Yes, I love women ... so what?  For years they have been talking about photos of massive orgies, but I have not seen anything. ... Why don't they show them!"" At New York's Rikers Island jail complex, Strauss-Kahn was placed on suicide watch, a routine procedure in such high-profile cases, two sources with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. Analysts suggest his career and political future are now in jeopardy, if not already dead. ""I do not see how he can perform his duties as director of the IMF,"" Jean-Francois Cope, secretary-general of France's ruling UMP party, told reporters Wednesday. ""So, by definition, this issue should be resolved in the coming days."" The comments came a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Strauss-Kahn is ""obviously not in a position to run the IMF,"" and Austria's finance minister Maria Fekter said, ""He should think about whether he is damaging the institution,"" and consider stepping down. A former French finance minister, national legislator and economics professor in Paris, Strauss-Kahn became the IMF's 10th managing director in November 2007. While the top job at the World Bank is customarily held by an American, the IMF chief is traditionally European. But as pressure mounts over Strauss-Kahn's possible resignation, there appears growing sentiment among developing nations to buck the trend. Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said that succession should be based ""on merit"" and the position ""should be considered (among) candidates from emerging countries,"" Portugal's official news agency reported Wednesday. South Africa's finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, said a new IMF chief should come from a developing nation, . ""We need to have an inclusive system,"" said Colin Bradford, a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist at the U.S. Agency for International Development . ""The West needs to include the emerging markets and encourage merit based leadership,"" he said.  ""We need an inclusive system, otherwise we're not going to have a structure that can manage the planet and implement a fair and legitimate system of global guidance."" Bradford suggested the scandal is an opportunity to change the unofficial policy, but others like German government spokesman Christoph Steegmans said the institution's leadership should remain European. In Strauss-Kahn's absence, First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky has been named acting managing director, ""and the fund continues its normal work,"" said IMF spokesman William Murray. According to a poll released Wednesday by the Conseil Sondage Analyses (Council of Polling Analysis), 57% of French people think Strauss-Kahn was victimized. Still, 54% said they think Strauss-Kahn's Socialist Party can win in the 2012 presidential race without him. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Deb Feyerick, Ivan Watson, Adam Reiss, Richard Roth, Saskya Vandoorne, Caroline Paterson, David Ariosto, Raelyn Johnson and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyers will seek $1 million bail, home detention with electronic monitoring .

"(CNN) -- Republicans such as Sens. Lindsey Graham, John Kyl and John Cornyn are tripping over themselves to jump on the latest ""Dumb Way to Solve the Illegal Immigration Problem"" bus by suggesting Congress examine repealing the 14th Amendment, which deals with one way of becoming a U.S. citizen. The far right has latched onto the idea that the provision in question -- which grants citizenship to children born in the U.S. -- is being abused by illegal immigrants who choose to come to America to have their children, thus worsening the illegal immigration problem. Some are even trying to suggest that how it is being used today is counter to the original intent of the Founding Fathers. Of course, the 14th Amendment was not in the first U.S. Constitution as drawn up by our framers. It was adopted on July 9, 1868, to prevent Southern states from denying citizenship to former slaves and their children, since they didn't choose to come to America. They were brought here for the purpose of the vicious and dehumanizing free-labor plan that helped build the nation -- slavery. It's clear that overall Congress is choosing to apply a Band-Aid to the illegal immigration problem instead of dealing with it head-on. We have members on both sides of the aisle who care more about protecting their precious jobs and partisan poll numbers instead of actually finding a bipartisan solution. So instead of leadership, we get asinine suggestions like this one, which will do absolutely nothing about the estimated 10 million illegal immigrants in the country. That's right, nothing. So what is the GOP's plan? To make it retroactive? OK, how about we take it all the way back and toss out all of the white descendants and anyone else non-Native American. They were here first, and all of us are simply intruding on the land that was theirs. Who thinks Graham, Kyl, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the other bumbling idiots we call U.S. senators would actually be able to pass the DNA test to establish whether they are Native Americans? But hey, since it is in vogue to alter the U.S. Constitution, why don't we just go all out and have congressional hearings to re-examine the entire document? We have blue ribbon panels in Washington for everything else, so why not pop the hood on that old document and bring it into the 21st century? Let's start with Article 1, which states that you must be at least 25 to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and 30 in the U.S. Senate. Since our men and women can die for America beginning at the age of 17, vote at 18 and drink at 21, this is an arcane law. We've got zillionaires building Fortune 500 companies before they are eligible to run, so why not let them take their shot? If you can be senile and serve as long as you want, why not give the young bucks a shot? Whack the 2nd Amendment. That's right, we don't need it. If no one had guns, would we really be that bad of a country? According to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, more than 100,000 people are shot and killed annually on average. The framers originally intended for militias to be created. With the number of city, county, state and federal law enforcement agencies, they should be able to round up every gun in America. We're paying these people; so let them do what they do. If guns were banned totally, our crime rates would be similar to that of countries such as England; our gun-related homicide rate is 44 times that of developed countries England and Wales, says the Brady Center. Tighten up the 10th Amendment. By doing this, we get rid of the constant states' rights battles. Just put all of the relevant laws on the federal level, such as jurisdiction over education and voting, and then we won't have to have 50 different ways of doing business. Let's junk the 22nd Amendment. If we've got a great president, why limit how long he or she can serve? I don't mind a four or five-term president. As long as the people are happy, let 'em keep handling our business! Franklin Delano Roosevelt is consistently voted the best president in American history. Would he have gotten that designation by just serving two terms? It's un-American for a group of people to have no representation. The 23rd Amendment provides presidential electors to the District of Columbia. That's not enough. They need their own members in the House, and two U.S. senators. Fair is fair, and this is dead wrong. The Equal Rights Amendment was never ratified, and it should have been. Why continue to screw over women in a male-dominated world? Come on, guys, stop being wimps and let the ladies have their say. I'm willing to put $1,000 down that the Republicans  and Democrats won't bother backing any of this. They'll likely say this is going too far and we should take it one step at a time. The same folks want to ban gay marriage in the Constitution and now change citizenship. Sorry, folks. The U.S. Constitution is far too precious to be messed with by a bunch of rabid politicians who don't have the guts to look their far left and right supporters in the eye and say they are going to truly lead on immigration. Let me know when this silly sideshow is over. Like many Americans, I am too busy trying to tackle real problems. This clearly isn't one of them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin says GOP and far right calling for repeal of 14th Amendment .

"(CNN) -- The Christmas season encourages us to think of Jesus, so highly revered and loved by both Christians and Muslims. So it is even more tragic to contemplate relations between the two religions today -- and particularly the plight of Christians in the Muslim world. In Iraq, savage killings of Christians have led thousands to flee the country. In Egypt, Christians are under severe pressure and siege. In Pakistan, there are too many cases like that of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who is facing a death sentence under Pakistan's blasphemy laws for allegedly slandering the Prophet of Islam. For both of us, a Muslim and a Christian, this violence is a matter of utmost gravity. One of us, Akbar Ahmed, was educated by Roman Catholic priests at Burn Hall, in North Pakistan, and then Presbyterian teachers at Forman Christian College in Lahore, and gratefully acknowledges the immeasurable debt he owes them, which he attempts to repay in promoting Christian-Muslim dialogue. The other, John Chane, is concerned as a bishop but also as someone also passionately devoted to promoting good relations between Christians and Muslims. We find that the situation has reached a breaking point because of the crisis in the Muslim world. Extremist Muslims feel that Islam is under siege by the West and seek to lash out at Christians, seeing an attack on Christians in their countries effectively as an attack on Israelis, U.S. troops in Iraq or the intelligence agencies behind U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan. Since 9/11, we have been speaking out in support of interfaith dialogue and understanding the deep bonds between Christianity and Islam. The Prophet named Christians, as he did the Jews, as ""people of the book,"" to be respected. In Islam, Jesus embodies compassion and the love of God and is miraculously born of the Virgin Mary. Not only is Jesus mentioned in the Quran more often than the Prophet of Islam, but an entire chapter is devoted to the Virgin Mary. As no other figure in Islam, Jesus can perform miracles, including giving sight to the blind, breathing life into a piece of clay, bringing the dead to life, and curing a leper (Quran 3:49). Muslims will say that they cannot be a good Muslim without first being a good Jew and a good Christian. Christians have always lived in Muslim lands; indeed Christianity is older than Islam in these areas. Christians living in the great societies of Islamic history, including Muslim Spain and the Ottoman Empire, largely lived in peace and security according to their own laws. Yet in the past few years, the persecution of Christians has increased in scope and frequency. The Iraqi Christian population, one of the oldest in the world and said to date from just after the crucifixion of Jesus, has sharply decreased. Before the Gulf War, more than 1 million Christians lived in Iraq; at the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the number had fallen to about 800,000. Two-thirds of those are estimated to have fled. The Christians who have remained are subjected to pogroms and slaughter by Muslim groups who are committed to exterminating them. The U.N. has reported high numbers of Christian refugees fleeing Iraq in recent weeks, and it has been noted that the chaotic aftermath of America's invasion may result in what all other invaders had failed to accomplish: the elimination of Iraq's Christian population. In Egypt, where Christians constitute 10% of the population, Christian girls are being kidnapped by shadowy Muslim groups and lured into Muslim marriages, with the state looking the other way. Christians in Egypt have no problem converting to Islam, but if Muslims want to convert to Christianity, they are refused permission to register as Christians on their ID cards, where religion must be stated. Riots are common, and Egyptian Christians live in fear for their lives. Asia Bibi's death sentence in Pakistan has gathered fierce support from certain Muslim groups, who are demanding the sentence be carried out. The blasphemy law is derived from laws passed during Pakistan's ""Islamization"" phase under President Zia Ul Haq, in which Islamic warriors were being trained to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. It has constantly been misused by Pakistanis seeking to attack each other in local feuds, and in today's high anti-American atmosphere has increased pressure on the Christians tenfold. Pakistani President Asif Zardari must pardon Asia Bibi immediately and bring this disgraceful episode to a close. With this in mind, it is impossible for good Muslims to be anti-Christian. We are appalled by the persecution Christians are being subjected to and appeal to Muslims to look to their own faith for how they should treat Christians in their midst. We need true Islamic scholarship and learning, not ignorant people quoting holy texts out of context. Anger or frustration at the way the West is behaving in the Muslim world or at their own governments is no excuse for slaughtering and slandering Christians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Ahmed, Chane: Bonds deep between Christians and Muslims; both faiths revere Jesus .

"(Mashable) -- United Airlines announced Tuesday that it is replacing its pilots' flight decks with iPads. Rather than carry around 38 pounds of operating manuals, charts and logbooks, the 11,000 pilots at United and Continental will use a pre-loaded iPad. United started distributing iPads to pilots earlier this month and plans to have devices to all pilots by the end of the year. United joins a growing list of airlines that have started converting some or all of their pilots to using electronic flight bags. Alaska Airlines announced in May its intentions to switch from paper to the iPad. Last week, Delta and British Airways started testing the use of iPad and other consumer tablets as replacements for traditional paper flight bags. According to United, moving away from paper to the iPad will do more than increase efficiency and improve safety: . ""Each iPad, which weighs less than 1.5 pounds, will replace approximately 38 pounds of paper operating manuals, navigation charts, reference handbooks, flight checklists, logbooks and weather information in a pilot's flight bag. A conventional flight bag full of paper materials contains an average of 12,000 sheets of paper per pilot. The green benefits of moving to EFBs are two-fold  it significantly reduces paper use and printing, and, in turn, reduces fuel consumption. The airline projects EFBs will save nearly 16 million sheets of paper a year which is equivalent to more than 1,900 trees not cut down. Saving 326,000 gallons of jet fuel a year reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 3,208 metric tons."" Electronic flight decks will allow pilots to update their materials instead of waiting for printed distribution, and the decrease in weight will also be easier on a pilot's luggage. Our question is: what happens in the event of a device failure? We assume that backup systems will be in place so that paper flight kits or replacement iPad devices will be available in the event of a broken pre-flight tablet.

"(CNN) -- An attorney for a 14-year-old Australian, accused of marijuana possession in Indonesia, is hoping to avoid a prison sentence for his client and have the boy released to undergo drug rehabilitation. The teen, whose name has not been publicly released, could face a minimum of four years in prison, according to Bali police. The teen has been held since his arrest last week in Bali's Kuta street area. ""We are still investigating on his involvement for carrying, using and having the narcotics,"" said Bali police spokesman Hariadi, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. Indonesia's drug laws are among the strictest in the world. But they do have a provision, article 128, under which those arrested with small amounts of drugs can be released to rehabilitation if they can prove they are an addict. In the case of underage offenders, that requires a declaration from the youth's parents, officials said. Mulyadi, superintendent of Bali's police drug squad, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the teen will be dealt with under the law applying to minors needing treatment for a drug problem. His parents would have to ensure he completes rehabilitation, Mulyadi said, and if they fail to report regularly they could face jail time. Michael Tene, spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Friday that the nation's policy on drug offenses is clear. ""I believe everybody should know by now that illegal drugs in Indonesia will face a really severe penalty,"" he said. The boy's attorney, Mohammad Rifan, said that he and the Australian Embassy are concerned about the junior high school student's rights as a juvenile. Greg Moriarty, Australia's ambassador to Indonesia, met with Mulyadi for nearly an hour Monday, the ABC reported, and spoke to the youth for a second time. ""We've talked to the Indonesian authorities about the range of issues, with our primary focus being the welfare of this boy and his family,"" Moriarty told the ABC. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke to the teenager on the phone, the ABC said. Gillard's office told the network that she offered reassurance to the youth, who was on holiday with his parents in Bali when arrested. However, Julie Bishop, deputy opposition leader, accused both Gillard and Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudd of competing for media attention over the case. -- Journalist Meidyana Rayana contributed to this report.","The teen's attorneys are trying to help him avoid prison .

"London (CNN) -- British police said Thursday they have arrested a 39-year-old woman suspected of involvement in the hacking of voice mails of celebrities and politicians by British newspapers. She's the fourth person arrested this year over a scandal that has forced the News of the World newspaper into a public apology and offers to pay compensation to victims, including actress Sienna Miller. Three men were arrested in April and are currently on bail, police said. The paper's royal reporter and a private investigator were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into voice mails of staff working for Britain's royal family. Police launched a new investigation this year into hacking by journalists in response to widespread complaints from politicians, celebrities and other high-profile figures who fear they have been targets. British lawmaker Tom Watson earlier this month said in parliament that police have information that ""strongly suggests"" a second private investigator targeted royals, lawmakers and high-level terrorist informers on behalf of the News International media group. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News International owns the News of the World, plus the Sun and the Times in Britain. British media said the targets included former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Kate Middleton when she was dating Prince William, the second in line to the throne. They married in April. Buckingham Palace and Prince William's office at Clarence House both declined to comment. The Metropolitan Police told CNN June 9 it ""has received a number of allegations regarding breach of privacy.... These allegations are currently being considered."" News International rejected the accusation. ""With regards to Tom Watson's specific allegations, we believe these are wholly inaccurate,"" the company told CNN, adding that it was cooperating with ongoing police investigations into phone hacking and had not been asked about the work of the private investigator Watson named in Parliament. But it said it was ""well documented"" that the investigator ""worked for a whole variety of newspaper groups."" News of the World officially apologized in April for hacking into voice mails. The Sunday tabloid newspaper offered compensation and ""apologized unreservedly"" for the ""unacceptable"" hacking. It did not name the victims. Murdoch's media empire encompasses the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, Fox News and Harper Collins publishers, as well as the Times and the Sun newspapers.","British police are investigating claims that journalists were behind widespread hacking .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that she intends to move ahead with a vote on a resolution that labels the deaths of more than a million Armenians during World War I as genocide. The resolution has strained U.S. relations with Turkey and drawn criticism from the Bush administration. ""This resolution is one that is consistent with what our government has always said about ... what happened at that time,"" Pelosi said on ABC's ""This Week."" When asked about criticism that it could harm relations with Turkey -- a key ally in the war in Iraq and a fellow member of NATO -- Pelosi said, ""There's never been a good time,"" adding that it is important to pass the resolution now ""because many of the survivors are very old."" ""When I came to Congress 20 years ago, it wasn't the right time because of the Soviet Union. Then that fell, and then it wasn't the right time because of the Gulf War One. And then it wasn't the right time because of overflights of Iraq. And now it's not the right time because of Gulf War Two. ""And, again, the survivors of the Armenian genocide are not going to be with us."" But White House Spokesman Tony Fratto said bringing the resolution to a vote ""may do grave harm to U.S.-Turkish relations and to U.S. interests in Europe and the Middle East."" Turkey's top general warned Sunday that ties with the United States will be irreversibly damaged if Congress passes the resolution, The Associated Press reported. Turkey has recalled its ambassador from Washington for consultations and warned of cuts in logistical support to the United States over the issue. The recall is only for a limited period of time, said a U.S. State Department official who talked to the ambassador. ""If this resolution [that] passed in the committee passes the House as well, our military ties with the U.S. will never be the same again,"" Gen. Yasar Buyukanit told the daily Milliyet newspaper, according to AP . The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted 27-21 Wednesday to approve the nonbinding measure, which declares the deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923 was ""systematic"" and ""deliberate,"" amounting to ""genocide."" The deportations led to the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million people. But Sunday, Pelosi stood by her previous assertion that the measure would be taken to a full vote if it passed the committee. Newly installed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Michael Mullen, tried to calm tensions by phoning his Turkish counterpart shortly after Wednesday's vote. Mullen told Gen. Yasar Buyukanit, Turkey's chief of staff, that the Pentagon is working hard to inform Congress of what the military implications might be if the Turks were to respond by cutting off U.S. access to the air base at Incirlik in Turkey. Seventy percent of U.S. air cargo bound for Iraq passes over or through Turkey. The Armenian government and Armenians around the world, including many Armenian-Americans, have been pressing for international support for their contention that Armenians were the victims of genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman Empire disintegrated in 1923, replaced by the modern republic of Turkey, where the Armenian issue remains sensitive. Turks reject the genocide label, insisting there was no organized campaign against the Armenians and that many Turks also died in the chaos and violence of the period. Though predominantly Muslim, Turkey, which borders both Europe and Iraq, is secular and pro-Western. In addition to its membership in NATO, Ankara is also seeking to become a member of the European Union. Speaking later on ABC's ""This Week,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the House committee's vote -- despite agreeing with the assertion that the killings amounted to genocide. ""I think it's a really bad idea for the Congress to be condemning what happened 100 years ago,"" the Kentucky Republican said Sunday. ""We all know it happened. There's a genocide museum, actually, in Armenia to commemorate what happened. ""But I don't think the Congress passing this resolution is a good idea at any point. But particularly not a good idea when Turkey is cooperating with us in many ways, which ensures greater safety for our soldiers."" Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham echoed those comments on CNN's Late Edition. ""I'm not worried about World War I. ... I'm worried about what I think is World War III, a war against extremists, and Iraq is the central battle front and Turkey has been a very good ally,"" Graham said Sunday. ""We've had problems with Turkey, but the problem that Turkey has with the northern part of Iraq, if you think it is bad now, let the country fail."" Turkey has engaged in ongoing cross-border skirmishes with rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which launches raids from northern Iraq. The recent killings of Turkish soldiers brought the conflict to a boiling point, and Turkey's parliament may consider a motion to approve cross-border incursions into northern Iraq as early as this week.  Watch how the rebels are straining U.S.-Turkish relations Â» . The United States and the EU have designated the PKK a terrorist organization.

"(CNN) -- Within just a few days, Ray Fearing went from the height of ecstasy -- he had just gotten a much-needed kidney transplant -- to the depths of depression, after finding out his transplant would need to be removed. ""I had been waiting for 10 years to finally have a normal life,"" said Fearing, a 27-year-old from Arlington Heights, Illinois. ""When it didn't work out, for a few days I just curled inward and started losing all hope. It was not an easy time."" What is notable about Fearing's case is not that he eventually got over his depression, or that he had an organ removed after transplantation -- those things happen.Â  What is remarkable is the simple, altruistic gesture he made just before his doctors removed his kidney that led to what scientists are describing as a medical first. Fearing donated his transplanted kidney to another patient, and the organ that had been failing inside Fearing's body thrived in the new recipient. ""When we removed that dysfunctioning kidney from Ray's environment, it recovered rapidly after being transplanted in a second recipient,"" said Dr. Lorenzo Gallon, Fearing's doctor and medical director of the kidney transplant program Northwestern Memorial Hospital. ""It is the first time that has happened."" ""It's amazing stuff, it really is,"" said Dr. Lynda Szczech, a nephrologist and president of the National Kidney Foundation. ""I don't know if this is something we're going to get into with great regularity, but the fact that these providers were able to think outside the box to save such a precious resource is frankly amazing."" Fearing's kidney transplant was in June 2011, using an organ donated by his sister, Cera Fearing.Â  He had been struggling for years with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a disease that causes scar tissue to develop in the part of the kidney that filters harmful substances. A few days after his operation, doctors took a biopsy of the new kidney and found it was quickly becoming damaged by the FSGS.Â  The cascade of problems following the operation was swift. Fearing said that soon after his operation, ""My abdomen was full of blood and very sore and [Dr. Gallon] told me he had to remove the kidney immediately."" Gallon said the situation, having to remove an organ to which so many hopes were now attached, haunted him.Â  But when he realized the organ could still be viable in another patient, he decided to broach the idea with Fearing. ""I said the kidney is yours, we can do whatever you want,"" said Gallon, who consulted with his hospital's ethics board before approaching Fearing. ""But if we take it out, we will discard it. Are you willing to allow us to see if this kidney might work for someone else?"" Fearing did not hesitate. ""There are thousands of people waiting for organs, I couldn't see myself just discarding one,"" said Fearing. The window of time in which to remove an organ that has been transplanted is narrow, said Dr. Matthew Cooper, director of the kidney transplant program at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Once a kidney is put into place, like any other transplant, it develops scar tissue around it. ""After a period of time, technically it is very difficult to remove it,"" said Cooper. ""It is equally difficult to think about transferring it to someone else."" Cooper said he just had scenario similar to Fearing's: A mother donated a kidney to her daughter, who suffers with FSGS. Ultimately, the kidney had to be removed. ""Hearing about this case, I'm thinking 'Wow, what a cool idea,'"" said Cooper.Â  ""I don't know why we didn't think of it."" Of course, the procedure undertaken at Northwestern is not standard; an organ with even marginal functionality would usually stay in the patient. ""In this case we're not talking about a lack of perfect function,"" said Gallon.Â  ""We're talking about a kidney making Ray sicker than it would have been to keep the kidney in."" But that kidney would ultimately make another patient, 67-year-old Erwin Gomez, better. Gomez's kidneys were irreversibly damaged, he said, after 20 years of struggling with hypertension. Once he received the new kidney, whatever damage that had occurred while it was implanted in Fearing was reversed. ""The disease, if captured early enough, is reversible when you remove the organ from the original recipient,"" said Gallon.Â  ""But another part of the story is that when a patient's kidney failed, he had the strength to say 'Let's help someone else.' That gesture has more weight than words."" The reality Fearing faces now is a long, difficult wait for another organ.For Gomez, receiving Fearing's organ means he could go back to work as a cardiovascular surgeon, and he has more time with his grandchildren. ""I feel bad for him because his misfortune is my gain,"" said Gomez, who on Wednesday met Fearing and his sister, Cera.Â  ""I'm completely grateful to them for considering re-transplanting that kidney ... I owe them eternal gratitude."" Fearing said that when he thinks about other people (91,836 and counting) waiting for a kidney transplant possibly benefitting from what he went through, it stems the tide of sadness he sometimes feels about his situation. ""It was hell when I went through it,"" said Fearing.Â  ""It is better that my situation helps people than having it take over my life.""","Transplant recipient Ray Fearing donates his failing transplanted kidney to another patient .

"(CNN) -- The last white president of South Africa said the post-apartheid land is still trekking toward prosperity for all and a better democracy. ""Fact is that in South Africa, transition is taking its time,"" F.W. de Klerk said in an interview aired Thursday on ""Amanpour,"" hosted by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""I'm convinced it's a solid democracy and it will remain so, but it's not a healthy democracy."" Two decades ago, de Klerk joined with then-African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela to end the notorious system of racial separation known as apartheid. Their efforts led to a Nobel Peace Prize. Read more: South Africa 'secrets' bill sparks outcry . Today, de Klerk said, the ANC -- the party in control -- is too powerful, its leaders have lost their ""moral compass,"" and it needs to split. ""Any democracy in which one party has 65 percent of the vote and all the other parties share in the remaining 35 is not healthy,"" said de Klerk, who spoke with Amanpour during a summit of Nobel laureates in Chicago. ""On paper, we have a wonderful constitution. We've had a number of successful, free elections. We've had peaceful handover of power from one president to the other. So we really comply with the definition of a good democracy. But the party political situation needs to be normalized."" De Klerk said the system is failing to deliver to the people. ""The main failure, why we haven't made better progress,"" he said, ""does not lie in any way whatsoever in the agreements we reached, which we negotiated between 1990 and 1994 and 1996. We agreed upon a good constitution, which is a transformational document. ""It is practical policies which have failed to bring a better life to the masses, which led to the enrichment only of the few, also amongst the new black elite. The middle class is growing fast, but somehow or another, the quality of service delivery had deteriorated substantially. Education has actually moved some steps backwards."" De Klerk cites high unemployment as a grinding problem, with a rate of 50 percent among blacks between ages 18 and 34. He was asked about a proposal by activist Desmond Tutu for whites to pay a wealth tax, given their heritage of privilege. ""I think already, if you analyze who pays tax, the tax structure is quite stringent on high-income earners,"" he said. ""Inasmuch as the white forms the biggest percentage of high-income earners, they pay tax comparable to what very rich people pay in other countries. ""The whites in South Africa don't mind putting their hands in their pockets. They realize that all of us share a joint destiny, a common destiny, that we need to win the war against poverty. There isn't a resistance against paying tax. ""There is irritation if the high taxes paid are misspent. If there is not a frugal administration of the finances, if millions and millions are spent on non-worthwhile get-togethers and on luxury cars and on this and on that. There is not a resistance against being part of the solution by putting their hands deep in their pockets."" Asked about a statement from Tutu calling the ANC worse than the apartheid regime, de Klerk said he was ""slightly surprised."" ""I think it explains that those who say it's only the whites who are concerned about what is happening at the moment, it demolishes that assumption. It proves that moderate, well-disposed, serious black South Africans are as concerned about the loss of its moral compass by the present ANC leadership."" Mandela became president of South Africa on May 10, 1994, after decades of white minority rule. De Klerk said he and Mandela have been ""close friends."" ""Not the closest in the sense that we see each other once a week. Also we live apart. But he's been in my home as a guest; I've been in his home as a guest. When I go to Johannesburg, my wife and I will have tea with him and Graca, his wife. No, we call each other on birthdays."" Mandela is age 93 and de Klerk is 76. ""There is no animosity left between us,"" he said, even though there once were tensions . ""The main cause for the tensions when there were tensions between us was the ongoing political violence,"" De Klerk explained. ""His accusations and personal attacks upon me, as if I were responsible for it, as if I were looking away and allowing it to happen, not recognizing that extensive efforts which I made to identify the culprits. So that was the main cause of the tension."" He said he first met Mandela when he was brought ""under the cover of darkness"" to his office from a prison where the longtime activist was being held. ""I have read, of course, everything I could read about him beforehand. I was well briefed. I was impressed, however, by how tall he was, by the ramrod straightness of his stature, and realized that this is a very special man. He had an aura around him. He still has an aura around him. He's truly a very dignified and a very admirable person."" De Klerk said it was true that Mandela said he had to persuade his associates ""to sit down with the enemy."" ""I had to convince some of my supporters in the same vein,"" he said. ""But can I say that from the beginning, in the negotiations, I realized that he was also a good listener, reaching out to the one speaking, trying to understand what lies behind what was being said. I felt it that first evening. And both of us later wrote in our respective autobiographies, after that very first meeting, we could report back to our constituencies, I think I can do business with this man."" Amanpour noted that Mandela had once called de Klerk ""a man of integrity"" but had taken it back, regretting that de Klerk had never renounced the principle of apartheid. De Klerk said he wasn't aware Mandela said he ""never renounced apartheid."" ""I have made the most profound apology in front of the Truth Commission and on other occasions about the injustices which were wrought by apartheid,"" he said, referring to the panel established to help uncover past government errors and abuses and to foster amity. He said he hasn't issued an apology for ""the original concept of seeking to bring justice to all South Africans through the concept of nation states,"" the creation of separate black and white states. ""In South Africa it failed,"" he said. ""And by the end of the '70's, we had to realize, and accept and admit to ourselves that it had failed. And that is when fundamental reform started."" He was then asked if apartheid failed because it was unworkable, or because it was simply morally repugnant. ""There are three reasons it failed,"" he said. ""It failed because the whites wanted to keep too much land for themselves. It failed because we (whites and blacks) became economically integrated, and it failed because the majority of blacks said that is not how we want our rights."" Still, de Klerk would not back off his belief in the validity of the original concept of ""separate but equal"" nation states. ""I don't apologize for saying that what drove me as a young man, before I decided we need to embrace a new vision, was a quest to bring justice for black South Africans in a way which would not -- that's what I believed then -- destroy the justice to which my people were entitled. My people, whose self-determination (was) taken away by colonial power in the Anglo World War."" That, de Klerk said, is how he was raised. ""And it was in an era when also in America and elsewhere, and across the continent of Africa, there was still not this realization that we are trampling upon the human rights of people. So I'm a convert.""","F.W. de Klerk is the last leader of white-ruled South Africa .

"(Financial Times) -- When Guo Shuqing became China's top securities regulator in October, investors hoped that he would bring a reformist zeal to the job that would help break the stock market's two-year losing streak. They were right about the zeal but wrong about the impact on the market. Barely a week has gone by without the regulator announcing another new measure to improve the functioning of the country's beleaguered market. But after a brief climb upwards, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index is down nearly 13 per cent since Mr Guo took office. It is premature to dismiss his reforms as a failure. Over the longer term, analysts say that Mr Guo's reform programme is putting the Chinese stock market on a more solid footing, helping to ensure that it will serve as an important channel for direct financing in an economy that has long been overly reliant on banks for credit. In the short term, the main problem is straightforward: China's economic weakness. As Chinese companies report their first-half results, there should be little doubt about why the stock market has struggled this year. ""Forecasts of company earnings have been continuously revised downward since the beginning of the year,"" Ivy Pan, an analyst with ABN Amro Private Banking, wrote in a recent note. Profits at industrial groups slid 2.2 per cent in the first half, sharply down from a 29 per cent gain in the same period last year, according to the national statistics bureau. The government has started to loosen policy, cutting interest rates twice and encouraging banks to lend more to infrastructure projects. However, compared with late 2008 when it unveiled a mammoth stimulus package, Beijing has been much more tentative this time around and liquidity remains relatively constrained. Given the bleak corporate backdrop and the muted policy support, a stock market rally this year would have been surprising and divorced from the fundamentals of the economy. For Mr Guo's part, analysts say it is reassuring that he has not been sidetracked by concerns over market weakness. One episode highlighted this point last month. Retail investors, who account for about three-quarters of the daily turnover in the Chinese market, launched an online petition that attracted nearly 10,000 signatures in two weeks. Their aim was to get the regulator to halt initial public offerings, believing that a cap on the supply of new equities would give a lift to the market. ""Behind every retail investor, there stands a family that has been deeply hurt by the endless IPOs and the poor performance of stocks,"" the petition read. The China Securities Regulatory Commission had halted IPOs in late 2008 after the market crashed, so there was a precedent for such a move. But this time it issued a rebuff. ""Based on previous experiences, suspension of IPOs doesn't help improve the market environment in any substantial way,"" the investor protection bureau said in a statement. Another indication of Mr Guo's commitment to press on with reforms even at the risk of hurting sentiment has been his focus on devising a better system to delist shares. One of the oddities of the Chinese stock market is the more than 150 shares that have ST before their company name. ST stands for ""special treatment"" and it means that a company has made losses for two consecutive years. Although mere shells of companies, they have hung around on China's main board and continued to suck in money from investors taking a punt. To stop this from happening, the securities regulator plans to put a 1 per cent ceiling on how much an ST share can rise in any given day and also to force persistently weak stocks to delist. Investors are struggling to digest these changes, but ultimately, they will improve the overall quality of the market, says Liu Fei of Fuli Investment Consultancy. Not all of Mr Guo's moves have been tough medicine for the market. Some have been aimed precisely at boosting short-term investor confidence. He has called on listed companies to increase dividends. Over the weekend, the securities regulator announced that it would cut transaction fees on stock trading by 20 per cent. With the Shanghai Composite Index up for three straight days, a rare winning streak in recent months, some believe the market might have finally found a bottom. Chen Ruiming, an equity strategist at Haitong Securities, a domestic brokerage, disagrees. He believes that economic worries will push Chinese stocks lower again in the coming months. But beyond that, he is optimistic that the regulator is finally getting it right. ""The stock market will only play a more and more important role in allocating capital and raising financing in China. The government is very focused on this,"" Mr Chen says. ""This is the big direction, the big trend, and it won't change."" Additional reporting by Emma Dong .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer has told CNN he may make another attempt to win the Olympic singles gold medal he craves in Rio in four years' time. The world No. 1 was pipped to the London 2012 crown by Britain's Andy Murray -- the man Federer beat to secure his seventh Wimbledon title just over a month ago. The 30-year-old has won 17 grand slams in his illustrious career and took gold in the doubles with Stanislas Wawrinka in Beijing four years ago, but he has failed to win the singles title in four attempts. Despite the disappointment he felt at being brushed aside 6-2 6-1 6-4 by Murray and missing out on topping the podium, Federer did at least claim his first solo medal. ""I'm not sure yet, it's four years away. I can retire in the meantime and come again!"" Federer told CNN about his hopes of an Olympic appearance in Brazil. ""But I'm not going to do that, I'm going to keep on playing. I hope I can do it. I'm turning 31 in a few days, so I'll be 35 for Rio -- I think it's possible but we'll see how it goes.""

A gold medal would have capped a perfect month for Federer, after his victory at Wimbledon catapulted him back to the top of the world rankings. And once the bitter sting of defeat on Centre Court had subsided, Federer insisted finally getting his hands on a singles medal tempered the disappointment of his straight-sets loss. ""I'd have to say I was very disappointed for three to five minutes,"" he said. ""I was in a little room waiting for the ceremony, I saw Del Potro and Murray and I saw how happy they were for gold, for bronze. ""Of course I'd just lost my match where Del Potro had to win the bronze over Djokovic. So I was in the middle and I was the only one who'd lost that day. ""I thought, 'Hmmm, I could either be sad right now, extremely sad, or extremely proud and happy,' and I chose to be extremely happy and proud. ""It was a dream summer for me. I won Wimbledon and I returned to world No. 1 and I tried everything I could to win Olympic gold, and I just came up against a better player on the day. ""So for me silver is the maximum I could get out of the Olympics this time around. I was just extremely happy, like a little kid there on the podium."" Supreme Serena crushes Sharapova to achieve the Golden Slam . Murray's victory offered the Scot recompense for his heartbreaking defeat in the Wimbledon final -- the first time a British male had reached the showpiece event since 1938. The 25-year-old beat former world No. 1 Novak Djokovic on his way to the final, and also claimed silver in the mixed doubles with Laura Robson. And Federer paid tribute to his rival for winning his first major tennis title less than a month after losing his fourth grand slam final. ""I thought he played great,"" Federer said. ""What a champion, to come back from losing in the finals of Wimbledon, resting, preparing. ""With the pressure, okay he had home advantage -- you can see that as an advantage or a disadvantage -- but for him to come back and win the Olympics, people sort of expected him to maybe do that. Why Federer's friend flew the Swiss flag . ""But he came through Djokovic and through me, who he lost to at the finals at Wimbledon, that's the sign of a champion. ""I always knew he had it in him but it was good to see he didn't let his head hang and was disappointed and upset and sour about his loss at Wimbledon. ""He should have been proud of it and that's what I told him then. I hope he enjoys this victory like he should because it was a big victory for him."" Federer survives marathon semifinal . Federer admitted his challenge for the gold was dampened by his marathon semifinal against Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro -- the longest in Olympic history at four hours and 26 minutes. The deciding set was eventually won 19-17 by Federer but the Swiss refused to blame tiredness for his lackluster performance. ""I missed a lot of opportunities, I think I made zero of nine break points and he made four out of 10. We weren't that far away from each other but he pulled away,"" he said. ""I think with the crowd he got momentum and it was hard to stop. Maybe emotionally I was a bit drained, or physically a bit slow at times after the Del Potro match, but I had a day to rest so no excuses, he was the better player on the day. ""I have regrets, a little bit, but I tried everything I could but it wasn't enough.""","World No. 1 Roger Federer wants to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Last week began with a missing persons report filed for Katherine Jackson but ended with Michael Jackson's mother attending a ""Unity"" concert by four of her sons. In the days between, a complex family feud played out in headlines and on celebrity TV. The 82-year-old Jackson family matriarch lost custody of the late pop icon's three children, who were placed into the guardianship of their cousin TJ Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Tito Jackson. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff suspended her as the children's custodian, saying she may be ""prevented from acting as a guardian because of the acts of third parties."" Four of her children -- including Janet, Jermaine, Randy and Rebbie Jackson -- had taken their mother to an Arizona spa, but kept her whereabouts secret from their other siblings and Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, 15; Paris, 14; and Prince Michael II, 10, who's also known as Blanket. Katherine Jackson to share custody of Michael Jackson's children . Those involved called it an intervention to protect their mother from people abusing her, while Paris and Prince Jackson made it clear they thought their aunts and uncles were trying to gain influence and control over Katherine Jackson. When Paris didn't hear from her grandmother for over a week, she tweeted ""8 days and counting . something is really off , this isn't like her at all .. i wanna talk directly to my grandmother!!<|3"" Katherine Jackson returned home early last Thursday to find a house in turmoil. ""Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to,"" Prince Jackson said in bitter Twitter posting attacking his aunts and uncles. ""I'm really angry and hurt."" There was a ""scuffle"" inside Katherine Jackson's Calabasas, California, home last Monday after Randy, Jermaine and Janet approached Michael Jackson's children in what witnesses said was an attempt to convince them to leave with them. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies broke it up and filed a battery report, a sheriff's spokesman said. Despite a relative calm in the Jackson family feud that set in over the weekend, youngest son Randy Jackson remained on the attack Monday against the men who run the Michael Jackson estate, accusing them of trying to isolate his mother so they could control the heirs they are obligated by law to protect. ""And THIS IS WHY I AM SO AFRAID FOR MY MOTHER..."" he said in a Twitter posting that linked to a story on the website of CNN contributor Roland Martin titled: ""Janet Jackson, Others Family Members Barred From Mom's California Home."" Prince Jackson blasts aunts, uncles over grandmother's treatment . Martin wrote on RolandMartinReports.com about an e-mail sent by estate lawyer Howard Weitzman to the lawyer for TJ Jackson just hours after Beckloff appointed him guardian of Michael Jackson's children. ""Given the circumstances of the last two weeks, and in order to protect the children and Mrs. Jackson, the Executors believe that it would not be appropriate to allow the following individuals to enter the residence or its grounds and we instruct the security to preclude the following from entering the residence or the grounds: Randy Jackson and any of his children, Janet Jackson, Rebbie Jackson and any of her children, Jermaine Jackson, his wife and any of his children, Janice Smith, or anyone else who was involved in the recent events that led to Mrs. Jackson's separation from and inability to communicate with Michael's children, or any agents or representatives of any of these individuals,"" Weitzman wrote. The e-mail was ""given to the security is in compliance with Judge Beckloff's order and is not arbitrary,"" Schultz said. ""As for the family members who are on that list, they were either at the house on Monday, July 23, 2012 or in someway participated in the events surrounding that date,"" Charles Schultz, TJ Jackson's lawyer, said in reply to Martin's story. ""Katherine Jackson is completely free to talk to whomever she chooses and is free to come and go from the house with anyone whom she chooses,"" Schultz said. ""This has been made completely clear to Mrs. Jackson and she has acknowledged that fact."" Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show . If Janet, Randy, Jermaine or Rebbie Jackson want to talk to their mother, who they took on an unannounced 10-day vacation to Arizona earlier this month, they can call her, he said. ""If anything, it sounds like the people who tried to manipulate her previously are continuing to do so via telephone,"" Schultz wrote. The list of people banned from the property was prepared by estate lawyers and sent at the request of TJ Jackson after ""certain members of the Jackson family showed up unannounced at the ... residence of Michael Jackson's mother and children, causing a very public disturbance,"" according to a statement by the estate lawyers. ""The list may be amended and managed by TJ Jackson Jr. or the Estate when appropriate,"" the estate statement said. Katherine Jackson's lawyer is preparing a court filing to ask Judge Beckloff to restore her as guardian of Michael Jackson's children through a plan where TJ Jackson would be a co-guardian. Prince, Paris and Blanket approved of the arrangement, Katherine Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders said. ""Mrs. Jackson is extremely pleased with the prospect of enjoying the pleasure of raising Michael's children without the day-to-day tedium of items such as managing the large staff that goes with such a high profile family and focus her attention on being a grandmother and raising Michael's children,"" Sanders said. The plan must still be approved by Judge Beckloff, who could put provisions into the custody order designed to prevent a repeat of this month's incidents.

"(CNN) -- U.S. swimming icon Michael Phelps has confirmed to CNN that he will now retire from competition, having became the most decorated Olympian of all time with six medals at London 2012. The man known as ""The Baltimore Bullet"" claimed his 22nd medal by winning gold as part of the U.S. 4 x 100m medley relay team on Saturday, but Phelps confirmed he has no desire to add to that tally in Rio in 2016. ""I'm done, that was my last race and this is my last Olympics,"" confirmed the 27-year-old. ""I'm ready for the next chapter in my life."" Phelps will leave London with four more gold medals, taking his career total to an unparalleled 18, after delivering a string of performances which silenced a growing number of doubters. Michael Phelps cements legacy as an all-time great . ""Looking back, I can say I've done everything I ever wanted to,"" said Phelps, who won medals at three consecutive Olympics after making his debut as a 15-year-old at Sydney 2000. ""I don't think it's too bad to be able to look back on your career and say that."" Ryan Lochte, a winner of two golds in the British capital, was tipped by many to outshine his compatriot, while Yannick Agnel also rose to prominence by winning the 200m freestyle race and anchoring France's victorious 4 x 200m freestyle relay. ""Ryan and I like racing each other,"" Phelps said. ""We bring the best out of each other. It's fun racing him, he's tough. He swims a lot of events, just like I do. We had the chance to go head-to-head quite a few times."" On the future of men's swimming, Phelps said he is looking forward to taking a back seat and watching new rivalries like the one between Lochte and Agnel develop over the next four years. ""We saw some amazing times in the pool this year. I said to Yannick that his 200m free was probably one of the top five greatest swims of all time. ""It's going to be cool watching these swimmers grow over the next four years and seeing the times they swim. That's definitely something I'll stay in tune with and check out what's going on."" One swimmer who has grown at the Games is China's Ye Shiwen, the 16-year-old who stunned the world when she swam the last 50m of her 400m individual medley heat quicker than Lochte in the corresponding men's race. The stunning feat led to suspicions of doping, although there is no evidence to suggest the double Olympic champion has taken any performance-enhancing substance. ""It's kind of sad that people have a great swim and that's the first thing they say,"" said Phelps. ""People who work hard -- it shows. There are people who just jump to that conclusion sometimes, and it's not right. ""Being able to watch her was amazing, I'm happy I actually out-split her over the last 100 ... almost every guy in the 400 IM got out-split by her.""","Michael Phelps confirms to CNN he will retire from competitive swimming .

"(CNN) -- There are few Olympians who can say they redefined their sport, but that is what former Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut did at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. She won balance beam, floor exercises and team competition gold as well as silver in the uneven bars at the Munich Games, and then team competition gold and balance beam silver four years later in Montreal. But she will be forever remembered for her ""Korbut flip"" -- a move so original and so groundbreaking that gymnastics would never be the same again. The maneuver involved standing upright on the upper uneven bar mid-routine and executing a backflip, catching the upper bar from underneath it -- a move that has since been made illegal in accordance with the Olympic gymnastics Code of Points. When she first performed the flip, at the age of 17 during a stunning routine at Munich, she was only awarded a score of 9.8, causing the onlooking crowd to go wild, jeering and booing at the judges for several minutes. ""I always wanted to try something different, we tried a lot of things,"" Korbut told CNN at London's Royal Opera House. ""When you're doing something things just happen -- like going back from the high bar to the low bar. That's how it worked."" ""After me, no one else did it. It had a risky element -- I had brought to gymnastics new gymnastics, new elements, not acrobatics. It is a mistake when it is said I brought acrobatics to the event."" Game-changing . Many of the moves which are now integral to modern gymnastics can be credited to Korbut's influence. Pre-Munich, much emphasis had been placed on poise and elegance, while older and more experienced gymnasts made up the majority of the competition. Now the sport is more dynamic with its participants primarily comprising youngsters that are on the cusp of adulthood, like Gabrielle Douglas of the United States -- the 4 foot 11 inch 16-year-old, who has won two gold medals in London at her first Games. ""If you see my routine from 1972 there's a lot of choreography, a lot of grace, and just a couple of new elements,"" said the 57-year-old Korbut, who acquired the nickname ""The Sparrow from Minsk"" after her first Olympic appearance. ""I was inspired by no one. I'm serious. It was the 1960s, we didn't have TV -- I was just born into gymnastics."" Human to Hero: Nadia Comaneci - Olympic gymnastics' first perfect 10 . Following a post-gymnastics career as a teacher and divorce after a 23-year marriage to a Belorussian folk singer, Korbut now lives in the U.S., which explains her calm, confident English. Her Munich routine might have been performed 40 years ago but the preparation she underwent to come so close to perfection is still ingrained in her memory. ""I didn't have a specific preparation. I just did it over and over again,"" Korbut recalled. ""You would just concentrate on what you've been doing for decades, and then show in just a moment what you've prepared for years and years. ""And of course, you still enjoy it. When you touch the equipment ... that's it -- you're in."" An inspiration . If much credit is given to Korbut's complex moves on the beam and bars for revolutionizing the sport, she also helped inspire a whole new generation of gymnasts. ""When I became famous for my gymnastics, it brought a lot of people to the gym, a lot of people having to pay money,"" she said. ""They were very talented, but money stopped the talented people attending gym. Unfortunately that was where it ended. Usually poor people have more of a hunger to work, I've seen it in life."" Forbes has estimated that the annual cost of an under-18 training program to be an Olympic-level gymnast is $15,000, which requires gymnasts to either have parents with very deep pockets or be willing to make huge financial sacrifices. How Gabby Douglas charted her own destiny . But, if gymnasts can transcend those financial cost, there are other great rewards to be had. ""You know what?"" says Korbut, ""to be in the Olympics is good, but to truly compete is great. It takes courage and hard work to compete. Everybody is a winner, I couldn't pick a best. Everyone who competes is great.""

"(Rolling Stone) -- Florence is a machine. When Florence Welch burst to prominence two years ago, fronting a five-piece rock band as vigorous as any that's emerged from the U.K. in recent memory, it was clear that she was something special: a vocalist with extra horsepower who hurtled through love songs like a truck tearing down an empty highway on a moonless night. Florence and the Machine's second album is as dark, robust and romantic as ever, but a revving 18-wheeler is no longer the apt metaphor for Welch's voice. Listen to her hooting and growling on ""Only If for a Night,"" a ballad somewhere between classic soul and midnight-on-the-moors English art rock. Listen to ""Shake It Out,"" a treatise on heartbreak and spiritual rebirth. ""I am done with my graceless heart/So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart,"" she cries, over guitars and keyboards that heave and chime. This is the sound of a human turbine -- a wind machine. Video: Record Shopping with Florence Welch . On their 2009 debut, Florence and the Machine were a wiry rock band with a taste for melodrama. Here the scale is vastly inf lated: turbulent ballads, powered by booming drums and vocal chorales rising like distant thunder, full of Welch's banshee wails. The music touches on Celtic melodies, bluesy rock stomps, nods to goth and gospel. But the wind never stops howling. Welch is a hopeless romantic obsessed with bad romance. Song after song casts relationships as struggle, with a hair's breadth separating rapture from disaster. For Welch, love is a force as vast and violent as nature itself. In ""What the Water Gave Me,"" a spurned lover goes to a watery grave: ""Oh, my love, don't forget me/I let the water take me/Lay me down/Let the only sound/Be the overflow."" Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch on Getting Sweaty and Forgetting Her Own Lyrics . This is a very British record, drawing on a tradition of iconoclastic U.K. pop that stretches from Kate Bush and Siouxsie and the Banshees to PJ Harvey. There's also a hint of another large-lunged Englishwoman here. Listen to ""Lover to Lover,"" where Welch blasts out a gospel-soul-style lead vocal over an arrangement that winks at the thudding backbeat of classic Motown. Adele, anyone? The rock band most forcefully evoked on ""Ceremonials"" is one of the biggest of all time: U2. Like them, Florence and the Machine are a true band, who channel garage-rock camaraderie into a huge, lashing sound more fit for an Olympian mountain peak than a garage. And like U2, Florence and the Machine are fronted by a singer with the pipes, and the shamelessness, to pull off the melodrama -- to turn the ridiculous into the sublime. 2011 has been a banner year for left-of-center women rockers, from St. Vincent to Feist to Laura Marling. Those women are boutique stars, as, for the moment, is Florence Welch. But ""Ceremonials"" suggests she could be a rock star, and a big one. The album concludes with the rock-gospel uplift of ""Leave My Body,"" as Welch roars out a vision of transcendence: ""I'm gonna leave my body/Moving up to higher ground/Lose my mind."" It's a big song, with a big, brash, Bono-worthy sentiment. And a voice to match. Copyright Â© 2011 Rolling Stone.","Florence and the Machine's second album is as dark, robust and romantic as ever .

"(CNN) -- Freedom. Equality. Both are cornerstones of our treasured American heritage as well as primary foundations of Sikhism. The South Asian faith preaches equality among races, genders, and classes and incorporates this teaching in all aspects of its practice. The Sikh temple, or gurdwara, which means ""House of God,"" is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and has four doors pointing toward the four cardinal directions to welcome people from all faiths, creeds and backgrounds, demonstrating Sikh ideals in its very architecture. You find this not only in India -- where the most notable of gurdwaras is the Golden Temple -- but also right here in the United States. In fact, you'll find it at the gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, where one of those doors that welcomes all comers was used by someone who did not have equality in his heart. Those four doors were kept open in no small part because of the tireless dedication and efforts of the president of the temple, Satwant Singh Kaleka, a personal, family friend I had the pleasure of knowing since we first welcomed members of his family to southeastern Wisconsin over 30 years ago -- a place that I still proudly call home. Although we now know him as a victim of this horrendous act and as the hero who died trying to stop the gunman, I remember him as someone who never missed an opportunity to open his heart to you and greet you with a smile. And what a characteristic and beautiful smile it was. His whole family is a fixture in the Milwaukee area and members carry with them that same spirit of love and caring. Indeed, one of my fondest memories is of Mr. Kaleka's family joyfully leading a group of guests in song at our home in Wisconsin the day after our wedding. So full of life. Fate intervened and my family and I did not attend services that Sunday. The loss of our friends is deep and saddening and it hurts. But the effect it's had on not just the Sikh but the broader community has been nothing less than profound. And for that, in the midst of this grief, I am sincerely grateful. In Sikhism, all are welcome and are one, without condition or limitation. All Sikh houses of worship have a community kitchen, called a langar, so that anyone in need of food can come and eat free of charge at any time. Indeed, tradition dictates that everyone who participates in langar sit at an equal level with all other diners to remind congregants to practice what is preached -- that we are all one. Both at langar and elsewhere, congregants strive to serve others, especially those less fortunate. It's a practice known as seva, selfless service, and it represents the highest ideal and function of Sikhs. At their core, the teachings and traditions of Sikhism represent the very best of what our beloved country stands for: a place of equality and opportunity open to and in service of all. And, as they've done in both in their home country and here in the United States, Sikhs have sacrificed greatly to ensure that this freedom is guaranteed to all. But, unfortunately, we also have to recognize that respecting and protecting the liberty and equality of all sometimes means making an uncomfortable peace with those who seek to undermine those very same principles. It means making a place for those who might not reflect our lofty ideals and who express hate instead of inclusion. It means making a place for, and respecting the existence of, people like Wade Michael Page, who committed the massacre in Oak Creek on Sunday. A messy thing, freedom. That said, as Americans and as Sikhs, we are committed to respecting the essential rights of every human. We know the sacrifices of heroes like Lt. Brian Murphy -- in critical condition after he was shot nine times helping victims -- Satwant Singh Kaleka and myriad others, are worth it in the end. It's the price of the society envisioned by the Founding Fathers and those sages who founded Sikhism. Indeed, it's the price we pay for the very foundation of this country that we call home. After all, as it is written in the very first stanza of the Sikh holy book, we are all one under one guiding spirit. Not just those with whom we agree, but all of us. Now, if only we could all remember that. Chardi Kala. May your spirit rise. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kanwar M. Singh.","Kanwar Singh: Freedom and equality are cornerstones of America and of Sikhism .

"(CNN) -- Scores of mourners packed a Memphis, Tennessee, church Wednesday for the funeral of Dr. Benjamin Hooks, a civil rights leader described as deeply inspirational and widely influential. Hooks, who led the NAACP from 1977 to 1992, died last week at the age of 85 after a lengthy illness. Neighbors, friends, family and political and civil rights figures filed into the Temple of Deliverance Church of God in Christ, where they watched a film that showed Hooks making a rousing speech and a montage of pictures celebrating his career and life. The historical imagery was accompanied by rocking spiritual music. Speakers delivered eulogies as Hooks' casket sat in front of the church pulpit. Noting that civil rights leader Dorothy Height, who died Tuesday, had been known as the ""godmother"" of the civil rights movement, Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP, told the audience that they gathered to honor the ""godfather of the NAACP and the civil rights movement."" ""Dr. Hooks leaves big shoes behind, and none of us can fill them,"" Jealous said. Marc H. Morial, National Urban League president and CEO, praised Hooks' collaborative bent. He believed in groups working together and not engaging in turf wars, Morial said. Hooks, he said, believed ""civil rights was a lifelong commitment,"" and while he was known for his strong oratory, his work in the trenches and his juggling of responsibilities were the qualities that made him effective. Morial said Hooks believed that ""if you choose to serve, it cannot be a part-time thing, it cannot be a sometime thing, it cannot be a pretend game. ... It must be in your heart, soul and DNA."" The Tennessee House canceled its activities so lawmakers could attend the funeral in Hooks' hometown. Hooks, who grew up in the segregated South, was ""a vocal campaigner for civil rights in the United States,"" the NAACP said when it announced his death. He was a lawyer and an ordained Baptist minister who joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and led the NAACP for 15 years, it said. The organization ""was suffering from declining membership and prestige when Hooks assumed his role as executive director,"" a University of Memphis biography says. The NAACP added several hundred thousand new members during his tenure, it says. The civil rights organization worked with Major League Baseball on a program that expanded employment opportunities for African-Americans in baseball, including positions as managers, coaches and in franchise executive offices, the NAACP said. Hooks was nominated to the Federal Communications Commission in 1972. He became the agency's first black commissioner and was with the agency for five years before leaving to serve with the NAACP. He also worked with colleagues to set up a program in which more than 200 corporations agreed to participate in economic development projects in black communities, the NAACP said. President George W. Bush awarded Hooks the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in November 2007. ""As a civil rights activist, public servant and minister of the gospel, Dr. Hooks has extended the hand of fellowship throughout his years,"" Bush said. ""It was not an always ... easy thing to do. But it was always the right thing to do.""","NEW: He ""leaves big shoes behind, and none of us can fill them,"" NAACP chief says .

"(CNN) -- The blogging platform Tumblr -- which sits somewhere between Twitter and WordPress on the social media spectrum -- has become one of the more interesting places to watch the debate about the Occupy Wall Street protests unfold. On the Tumblr site ""We Are the 99 Percent,"" people who sympathize with the New York-based protest movement are telling first-person stories of hardship and unemployment. Each post features a photo of its author holding up a paper sign that tells a bit of the person's story and says ""We Are the 99 Percent,"" a reference to the protestors' concern that the top 1% of Americans command much of the country's wealth and power, leaving the rest to struggle. ""We are getting kicked out of our homes. We are forced to choose between groceries and rent. We are denied quality medical care. We are suffering from environmental pollution. We are working long hours for little pay and no rights, if we're working at all,"" a blog introduction says. ""We are getting nothing while the other 1 percent is getting everything. We are the 99 percent."" Here's one post from Tuesday: . ""My mom worked on Wall Street for almost 30 years. In 2008, when the market crashed, the company she worked for shut down. The CEOs were taken care of, but all the loyal workers were left with nothing. My mom still hasn't found work. I am the 99 percent."" And another: . ""I'm a small business owner. I just bought new work computers so my colleague and I can do our jobs. Now, I have no money for food for the next 3 days (next paycheck). I'm always one check away from eviction. I'm one of the 'lucky ones.'"" On Tuesday night there were 77 pages filled with similar stories, and about a half-dozen posts on each page. As attention for that Tumblr page grew, a competing blog with a more conservative ideology came into being. The conservative ""We are the 53%"" Tumblr page says it represents the 53% of Americans who must pay federal income tax (Most people who make less than $30,000 per year pay no major federal income taxes, according to a 2009 report from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, as CNNMoney reports). The assumption is that Occupy Wall Street protestors and sympathizers on the ""We Are the 99 Percent"" site don't pay taxes. ""I work 3 jobs. I have a house I can't sell. My family insurance costs are outrageous. But I don't blame Wall Street. Shut it up you whiners. I am the 53% subsidizing you so you can hang out on Wall Street and complain,"" the introductory post on October 5 says. The 53% blog was created by Erick Erickson, who also is an editor at the conservative site RedState.com, according to the Washington Post. (Erikson also is an occasional commentator for CNN). The conservative Tumblr blog has six pages of posts, compared to 77 on the site sympathizing with Occupy Wall Street. ""I would love to hang out in in (sic) the park for a couple of weeks protesting the entitlement generation and radical egalitarianism, but I have a job to go to. Go figure,"" another post says. Tumblr has become the site of choice for people organizing the Occupy Wall Street movement, which started in New York and has spread to many other cities in the United States, writes Jesse Emspak for DiscoveryNews. ""The site has been a force behind the Occupy Wall Street protests, growing the number of demonstrations from just dozens of people in late September to thousands,"" he says. At The Atlantic, Rebecca Rosen says the ""We Are the 99 Percent"" Tumblr page is the digital equivalent of bathroom stall graffiti -- ""allowing you to bear something private and maybe find someone else carrying around the same weight."" Along with the It Gets Better Project and PostSecret, the Tumblr account is part of an increasingly important medium called the ""collaborative confessional,"" she says. ""This is self-service history, with no curator and no narrator. Some of the stories call out for follow-up questions, but there is no one to ask them,"" Rosen writes. ""The results are raw and rough, but demonstrate that, with or without a Terkel, the power of personal narrative, whether on the radio, in a book, on YouTube, or on a Tumblr, can cut through the noise and cynicism of punditry and give shape and texture to our national story.""","""We Are the 99 Percent"" blog gains popularity on Tumblr .

"(CNN) -- Big-spending English Premier League club Manchester City have completed the much-anticipated signing of Argentina international Carlos Tevez. Carlos Tevez faces competiton from seven other forwards in Manchester City's first-team squad. The 25-year-old was presented to the media on Tuesday afternoon ahead of City's departure the following day for a three-match pre-season tour of South Africa. City revealed on Monday night that the striker has agreed a five-year contract and would complete his move from bitter rivals Manchester United after passing a medical. A fee for the transfer has not yet been revealed, but it is reported that City have agreed to pay about $40 million to take over the player's ownership rights from the sports agencies which previously held them. Tevez denied claims by his former manager Alex Ferguson that he had decided to leave Old Trafford as long ago as January. Ferguson also said that he had offered the player a new contract on the night United played Inter Milan in the Champions League in March, but Tevez did not return his calls or text messages. ""I was there for two years and Sir Alex never called or sent any text messages in that time,"" Tevez told reporters through an interpreter. ""The only time he spoke to me was after the Champions League final in Rome when I was going back to Argentina. It doesn't seem that this is the way to treat a player in two years at the club. It doesn't seem there is a line of communication. ""It is United people talking about signing a contract (in January) but it is not true that it was decided then. I felt Sir Alex Ferguson and (United chief executive) David Gill did not do enough to try to keep me. ""The fact I did not stay at United was not because of the fans. They must understand a part of my heart will always be with them. They were always extremely supportive, even when I wasn't playing."" City manager Mark Hughes confirmed that the club had been in contact with Arsenal over a move for Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who has been linked with a $40 million move to Eastlands. ""I think there's been discussions between ourselves and Arsenal but, as is my usual response about players that we haven't signed, really it's not the right time or place to discuss that -- only in as much as yes, there has been contact,"" Hughes told reporters. ""There's a deal to be done, possibly, but it's not been concluded as we speak. Until it actually happens, really it's not the time or the place to discuss it here."" The Mancunians have also made a huge offer for Chelsea captain John Terry, but the London club have insisted that the England defender is not for sale. ""I have fantastic respect for John Terry, ever since I saw him as a young player when I was at Chelsea as a player myself,"" Hughes said. ""He's a great player and an outstanding captain. But he's very much a Chelsea player at this moment in time. I think any manager would covet a player of the type of John Terry, but at this moment in time he's a player for Chelsea, so we have to respect that."" The high-profile capture of Tevez is a big boost for the club and its billionaire Abu Dhabi-based owner, who was forced to end his long-running bid to sign Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. The Cameroon international, who had been offered a reported $400,000 a week wages, stalled on the move after being offered a new deal by the European champions, with some papers claiming he wanted a big chunk of any transfer fee paid by City. If Hughes does also sign Adebayor then the Welshman will have nine strikers at his disposal. The former Manchester United forward already has new $30 million signing Roque Santa Cruz, January's $23 million acquisition Craig Bellamy and Brazil star Robinho -- who arrived a year ago in a British-record $58 million coup. Felipe Caicedo, Valeri Bojinov, Benjani Mwaruwari and Ched Evans have also been given shirt numbers -- Tevez will wear No. 32 -- in a 57-strong squad named ahead of the new season. Hughes has released former England international striker Darius Vassell, while England Under-20 forward Daniel Sturridge has joined Chelsea for a fee to be resolved by a tribunal. Tevez scored 19 goals in 63 appearances for Premier League champions United after joining from West Ham, who he controversially saved from relegation despite a furor over his part-ownership with agent Kia Joorabchian's MSI Group. He has won 50 international caps, and has recently returned from holidays following Argentina's latest World Cup qualifiers. Tevez, who has won an Olympic gold medal, is the only man to be named South American Player of the Year in three successive seasons.","Argentina striker Carlos Tevez joins Manchester City on a five-year contract .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is calling for fresh volunteers in a months-long war with rebels attempting to bring about an end to his 42-year rule -- and women of all ages are answering, CNN has learned. Women from in and around Gadhafi's stronghold of Tripoli have been traveling south to a training facility in Bani Walid to practice with weapons, a common sight in a country where young girls receive military training in schools. As NATO's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark and rebels continue to fight to oust Gadhafi, he is tapping everything and everyone in his arsenal to hold on to power. At the training facility in Bani Walid, women are training to ""defend Moammar and the country,"" said Sgt. Faraj Ramadan, a woman who is training other women to properly handle weapons. ""They train to use it, assemble it and take it apart, and to shoot,"" she told CNN recently. ""They were trained and got excellent scores."" At a recent graduation at the facility, 40-year-old Fatima Masoud said she liked the training. She said she left her textile job every day at 4 p.m. to train. ""I liked training and defending my country, and now I'm am training women from all ages to use weapons,"" she said. It is unclear how many have answered Gadhafi's call or how many had graduated from the program at Bani Walid. But women are fighting alongside government forces. A woman, who did not want to identified, fresh from the frontlines, attended the graduation. She was still wearing a cannula in her wrist. ""Do not underestimate any woman in Libya, whether old or young,"" the woman said. ""The woman is still able to perform more than you think."" Gadhafi's government claims it has handed out more than a million weapons to civilians since the uprising began. CNN cannot independently verify the claim.","Women in Libya are training to defend Moammar Gadhafi's regime .

"(CNN) -- A German tries again for a piece of gold medal history, and the sprint queens will find glory just around the corner. Here are five things to watch at the Olympics on Wednesday: . 1) Women's 200 meters: Jamaica vs. the United States . Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica has won the past two Olympic 200 meters for women. But she was beaten at her national trials by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who won the 100 meters on Saturday. They'll be keeping an eye on Allyson Felix of the United States, who ran the fastest time in the past 14 years in winning the U.S. trials. U.S. sprinters Carmelita Jeter and 400-meter winner Sanya Richards-Ross also have medal hopes. Seven Cameroon athletes missing . Final is at 9 p.m. London time (4 p.m. ET) 2) Boxing: U.S. shutout avoided thanks to the women . While the U.S. men achieved an embarrassing first at the London Olympics by failing to win any medal, the American women are guaranteed two. Flyweight Marlen Esparza, who CNN profiled in the documentary ""Latino in America: In Her Corner"" and 17-year-old Claressa Shields, a middleweight, are in the semifinals of their divisions. A loss means a bronze, there are no third-place matches, and a win means a chance to be the winner of the gold medals in the inaugural events. Matches begin at 1:30 p.m. London time (8:30 a.m. ET). 3) Men's decathlon: It's a new experience for the top contenders . Unlike most track and field events, the defending champion is not entered in the decathlon. Bryan Clay stumbled in the hurdles at the U.S. trials and failed to make the squad. But Ashton Eaton set a world record at the trials, and Trey Hardee was world champion in 2009 and 2011. They are both competing in the Olympics for the first time, as are Pascal Behrenbruch of Germany, Kevin Mayer of France, Hans Van Alphen of Belgium and Eelco Sintnicolaas of the Netherlands, meaning the podium will likely have three new visitors. Gabby Douglas takes a tumble . The first of the five events on Day 1, the 100 meters, is at 10:10 a.m. London time (5:10 a.m. ET) 4) Men's basketball: Win or go home . The knockout phase of the men's hoops tournament begins with Russia facing off against Lithuania. Team USA should have an easy time with Australia, which finished fourth in its group. It is a repeat of the situation at the 2008 Olympics when the United States trounced the Aussies 116-85. In other games France plays Spain and Argentina meets Brazil. Games begin at 2 p.m. London time (9 a.m. ET) Team USA plays at 10:15 p.m. (5:15 p.m. ET) 5: Kayak: German seeks a gold for the fourth straight Games . Katrin Wagner-Augustin of Germany gets a second shot at becoming the second woman in Olympic history to win a gold medal at four consecutive Games. Lisa Leslie, who won gold with the U.S. basketball teams in 1996-2008, is the only other woman to do so. Wagner-Augustin failed again to win an individual gold when she finished fourth in her semifinal in the K1 500 meters on Tuesday but she hopes to add to her four golds in doubles (K2) and Fours (K4) with a win Wednesday.

"(Health.com) -- Middle-aged men who take steps to improve their heart health by eating better, getting more exercise, or taking cholesterol-lowering drugs may end up improving their sex lives as well, according to a new analysis of existing research. Nearly 1 in 5 men in the U.S. has difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection, a condition known as erectile dysfunction (ED). The new study, which appears this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine, suggests that ED drugs such as Viagra aren't the only solution and aren't always enough to address the problem, says coauthor Dr. Stephen Kopecky, M.D., a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. ""If you do take care of your lifestyleâeating right, exercising, losing weightâyou respond much better to the Viagra, the Levitra, the Cialis,"" Kopecky says. By the same token, he adds, if these drugs become less effective ""that should be a sign that...you need to take care of your lifestyle.'"" Health.com: 7 ways to treat erectile dysfunction . ED is troubling enough by itself, but to make matters worse it's also a known harbinger of heart disease. The arteries in the penis that expand during an erection can become weakened and clogged with cholesterol in the same way as the arteries that surround the heart. This is why ED often shows up three to five years ahead of life-threatening cardiovascular problems such as heart attack or stroke, especially in younger men, Kopecky says. ""The common denominator is blood flow,"" he explains. ""If you look at a guy in his 40s who has erectile dysfunction and then you compare [him] to another guy in his 40s who doesn't have erectile dysfunction, the guy with ED is about 50 times more likely to have heart disease."" Despite this well-established link, there has been little research into whether addressing risk factors for heart disease (such as unhealthy cholesterol numbers) can also reverse ED. The studies that have been conducted have been relatively small and have looked at a single location, which means they may not apply to the population as a whole, Kopecky and his colleagues say. Health.com: 10 heart-healthy rules to live by . To clarify the effect of heart-healthy lifestyle changes on ED, the researchers combed through the medical literature for placebo-controlled clinical trials in which men with ED modified their lifestyles or began taking cholesterol-lowering statin medications. The analysis was funded entirely by the Mayo Clinic. In the end they focused on six studies that included a total of 740 men and were conducted in the U.S., Italy, Nigeria, and Iran. In all of the studies, which ranged in length from two months to two years, heart healthy regimens and better cholesterol numbers were associated with modest but measurable improvements on a survey that rates erectile function on a scale from 5 to 25. The average improvement in sexual function seen in the pooled studies was three points, one point shy of the threshold experts consider ""clinically important."" For some men, especially those with more persistent cases of ED, a change of that magnitude would be negligible. For those with mild or occasional ED, however, it would translate into noticeable improvements in sexual function, the researchers say. Health.com: Erectile dysfunction? Try losing weight . Dr. Kevin Billups, M.D., an associate professor of urology at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, says that the close relationship between heart health and sexual function ""hasn't become the public health message that it should be."" Doctors and other experts need to do a better of job of informing the public that a healthier heart often means better erections, adds Billups, who studies the link between heart health and erectile function but did not participate in the new research. ""That's the first thing I talk about with all the guys that come in now,"" he says, referring to the ED patients he sees in his urology practice. ""'Are you watching your diet? What kind of exercise program are you on?' Just putting these men on the ED medications...probably isn't enough to get optimal results."" Health.com: The best foods for your heart . Even if they're told that it may improve their ED, getting men to change their lifestyle and lose weight is no easy task, Kopecky says. He stresses, however, that even small and simple lifestyle changesâsuch as eating at least five servings of fruits and veggies dailyâcan make a big difference. But the ""real key"" is exercise, Kopecky says. Just 10 minutes of vigorous exercise three times a week ""does a whole lot to improve your heart function [and] blood vessel function,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- A Rhode Island-based video game company founded by former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, according to court documents. The company, 38 Studios, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Thursday. According to the filing, the company owes its creditors $150.7 million but only holds $21.7 million in assets. ""This action comes after several weeks when the company has reviewed, considered and received the recommendations and advice with respect to potential avenues for relief that are currently available,"" the company said in a statement Thursday. ""After ongoing negotiations with the State of Rhode Island and potential investors and other interested parties, the company has been unable to find a solution to the current stalemate."" The move comes less than two weeks after the company laid off its entire staff of nearly 400 employees without pay. Schilling founded 38 Studios after a 20-season career in the majors that ended in 2007. He pitched on three World Series championship teams and was once a co-MVP in the series. (He wore number 38 when he played for the Boston Red Sox). In 2010, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation was able to persuade 38 Studios to relocate from Massachusetts with $75 million in loan guarantees. At the time, the company had not shipped a single product and was working on an expensive project, a ""massive-multiplayer online role playing game,"" or MMORPG. The company was tasked with bringing jobs to Rhode Island's tech sector, but the February release of its first game, ""Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning,"" was not enough to keep the company in the black. Rhode Island has the second-highest unemployment rate in the country, at 11.2%. Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee said in a press conference that he had no prior knowledge of the filing, but that he was not completely surprised. Chafee told the media his office had been working with 38 Studios to find potential investors, and that it will now do its best to help the taxpayers. ""We're going to do everything possible to maximize return of our investment, and the taxpayers of Rhode Island can have full confidence that if there's a penny that we can get, or a nickel or a dime, we'll get it."" The FBI, the U.S. Attorney's office of the District of Rhode Island, the state attorney's office and the Rhode Island State Police have opened an investigation into the circumstances of all financial transactions at 38 Studios, according to Col. Steven G. O'Donnell, superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police. O'Donnell would not comment on whether the investigation is related solely to the bankruptcy filing.","38 Studios, founded in Massachusetts by ex-pitching ace Curt Schilling, files Chapter 7 .

Her story: Four days after Starla Jones' estranged older sister gave birth to a little girl, the baby was handed over to foster care. (The laws in some states prohibit the baby from being identified.) Starla, herself a new mom, felt she needed to step in and help. ""I wanted to do what I could to give her a normal life,"" says Starla, who lived in foster homes for a couple of years as a child. ""I didn't want her to go through what I did."" When she and her husband welcomed her niece at 3 weeks old, the newborn was underweight and still dealing with drug withdrawal symptoms like not wanting to be held and difficulty sleeping. ""That was probably the hardest time of my life,"" she says. Fortunately, the little girl is thriving under their care. ""She's so smiley,"" says Starla.

"(CNN) -- The Syrian Army assaulted the city of Houla on May 25, murdering 90 people, 30 of them children younger than 10. Amateur video reveals rows of bodies, adults and children, riddled with bullet holes and filling makeshift morgues. Earlier, reports from Homs described people tortured, doused in gasoline and set on fire, with the death toll including men, women and children. The Red Cross announced it is withdrawing its workers in Damascus, leaving only 50 core workers, and the Arab Red Crescent has suspended its first aid efforts in Aleppo after repeated attacks on its vehicles and facilities by the Syrian army. Civilian residences are shelled with artillery and tanks and bombed from planes, day after day. What else would it take for the civilized world to conclude that the line has been crossed and decent people can no longer stand by? True, the atrocities in Syria do not compare in scope to those of the Holocaust; however, they have one major common element: They are not the work of some gangs, like those in Mexico; terrorists, like al Qaeda in Iraq; or foreign intruders, like the Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan. They are the acts of a national government, a government that is systematically using its military to hammer its own people. Here, there are no difficulties in determining who is involved, and above all, who is in charge. The media sticks punctiliously to professional standards and keeps reminding us that this or that report about the last outrage is ""unconfirmed."" The New York Times notes that reports on summary executions by Syrian security forces in Baba Amr remain ""unconfirmed."" Although this or that detail may not be verifiable, the Syrian authorities do not deny that most of the reported barbaric acts have taken place. They merely claim that they are dealing with foreign terrorists and are entitled to a free hand. Q&A: What options are left in Syria? The United States and other democracies claim that they are stymied by the U.N. Security Council's refusal to authorize the use ""of all means necessary"" to stop the carnage, leaving the blood of Syrian civilians on the hands of Russia and China, who threaten to veto the kind of resolution that legalized the intervention in Libya. But when the West faced atrocities on a smaller scale in Kosovo and could not gain the U.N.'s blessing, it acted decisively and effectively. The bloodshed was stopped. If the West were to proceed in Syria, countries could point to a unanimous U.N. General Assembly resolution known as R2P, which states that all governments have a responsibility to protect their own people. The resolution warns governments that if they do not discharge this responsibility, they forfeit their right to sovereignty and the international community has not only a right to interfere, but a duty. We are told that the rebels include extreme Islamists, even al Qaeda elements, who are hostile to the West and may commit atrocities of their own. Indeed, the rebels lined up against the wall and shot dead several Bashar al-Assad loyalists in Aleppo on August 1. There is also the fear that rebels might incite a civil war among Syria's various ethnic groups, a result that would cost many additional lives. Our goal should be limited: Pressure al-Assad's regime to negotiate with the rebels on major reforms but not to hand them victory. We surely do not want to repeat the mistake we made in Iraq, in which the army and most civil servants were fired and the country plunged into anarchy and lawlessness. Above all, we must warn the rebels that we shall cease all support for them if they commit atrocities, a step we did not undertake in Libya, resulting in some very distressing consequences. Finally, we are cautioned that the Syrian military is mightier, better equipped and more able to fight than the Libyan one was. Well, it is a year and half since the Syrian conflict began, and the army so far has been unable to gain an upper hand against disorganized, poorly equipped, untrained rebels. It seems obvious that al-Assad's troops are hardly a match for the American military machine. No one in his right mind suggests that the U.S. should invade Syria. But the U.S. could bomb the command and control centers of the Syrian army and, above all, the compound of those who are responsible for the brutal slaughtering of civilians -- al-Assad and his inner circle. The goal would be to punish the leaders of this campaign, to stop the slaughtering of civilians, to force those in charge to negotiate a settlement with the rebels and to warn other tyrants who watch Syria from the sidelines that they should not believe that they could act with impunity if they were to follow a similar course. Frankly, it may be too late. The rebels might not be ready to deal with the Syrian regime, even if those who head it are replaced. And the regime might collapse and the country plunge into chaos and increased bloodshed at any moment. However, if America and its allies act, it will be clear that there is a limit to our tolerance -- that we will not hide behind the veto of Russia and China and refuse to move when large-scale crimes are committed by a government against its own people.

"(CNN) -- Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' directive overruling the Food and Drug Administration's decision to make emergency contraception available over the counter for all women, including girls under 17, was not only unprecedented, it was substantively without merit. After a thorough and months-long review of the evidence, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research determined that the contraceptive, Plan B One-Step, was safe and effective for teens, and that teens on their own understood what the product did -- and didn't do -- and how to use it. Based on these expert findings, the FDA commissioner, Margaret Hamburg, concluded that Plan B One-Step was ""safe and effective and should be approved for nonprescription use for all females of childbearing potential."" The FDA decision overruled by Sebelius would have made emergency contraception available, alongside condoms and pregnancy tests, on the shelves of pharmacies, grocery stores and other retailers, giving women of all ages at risk of unintended pregnancy timely access to this safe and effective backup contraceptive method. And time is of the essence here: Although Plan B can help prevent pregnancy for up to three days after intercourse, it is more effective the sooner it is taken. Plan-B contraceptive pill will stay prescription-only for girls under 17 . Hamburg's concurrence with the recommendation to make the emergency contraceptive available over the counter was in line with the positions taken by the nation's most prestigious medical, scientific and public health organizations. The only groups opposing the FDA's decision were self-styled ""pro-family"" groups that oppose emergency contraception -- and most other methods of modern contraception -- outright. Sebelius, who is not a scientist and who offered no evidence to contradict the FDA's conclusions, said she based her decision on her personal belief that adolescents as young as 11 might not understand how to use emergency contraception without guidance from a health care professional. To invoke 11-year-olds was not only inflammatory, but diversionary. Fewer than 1% of 11-year-old girls have had sexual intercourse, but close to half of girls -- most beginning at 15 or 16 -- have had sex by their 17th birthday. Under Sebelius' ruling, girls under 17 will be unable to obtain emergency contraception without a doctor's prescription. And if, as Sebelius insists, younger teens are unable to understand the label on this product--which the evidence suggests they can-- it follows that they also wouldn't understand the labels on countless other over-the-counter medications that can have severe, even fatal, side-effects if misused -- which this product does not. Restricting access to safe and effective contraceptive methods will only increase the number of women, teens and older women alike, who will have to face an unintended pregnancy. Half of all pregnancies in the United States -- and 82% of teen pregnancies -- are unplanned. The United States already has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy in the developed world. Unintended pregnancy is not just a statistic; it has real consequences. On an individual level, it results in women either having an abortion or an unplanned birth. And it harms the body politic by perpetuating a seemingly endless and unquestionably divisive national abortion debate. The entirely science-based decision by the FDA to make emergency contraception more easily available was a chance to take an important step forward for women and for our society. Instead we've taken a huge step back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sharon Camp.","Sharon Camp: Secretary Sebelius' overrule of FDA on emergency contraception wrong .

"(CNN) -- Jennie-O Turkey Store is recalling nearly 55,000 pounds of frozen, raw turkey burgers that may be contaminated with Salmonella, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Saturday. The recall pertains to packages of ""All Natural Turkey Burgers with seasonings Lean White Meat"" with a ""use by"" date of December 23, 2011, the FSIS said on its website. The ground turkey, which comes in 4-pound boxes containing 12 patties, is sold exclusively at Sam's Club, Jennie-O said on its recall website. People who have purchased the product should not consume it. They can return it to a Sam's Club store for a full refund, Jennie-O said. An investigation of a Salmonella outbreak in 10 states found three people in Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin reported illness after eating the Jennie-O ground turkey, leading the FSIS to determine there is a link between the product and the outbreak, the agency said on its website. The last of these illnesses was reported on March 14. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial food-borne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly and persons with HIV infection or are undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of the illness caused by eating food contaminated with Salmonella are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever, according to the FSIS. Additional symptoms may include chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.","The turkey burgers involved in the recall were sold exclusively at Sam's Club .

"(CNN) -- Is the anger in American politics edging towards violence? A man is shown legally carrying a rifle at a protest against President Obama in Phoenix, Arizona. About a dozen protesters carrying guns gathered this week, not far from a building where President Barack Obama was talking to the public about his plans to reform U.S. healthcare. One of them had a rifle slung over his shoulder, a handgun in a holster and bullets in his back pocket. Last week, a man protested outside another Obama healthcare meeting with a gun strapped to his thigh. It may be hard to believe but it wasn't illegal. The meetings were held in parts of the U.S. that restrict concealed weapons but allow them to be carried freely if they're in plain sight. A small number of activists make a point of exercising that right. The right has limits. The Secret Service can bar anyone with a gun from entering the buildings where the president was speaking. The protesters stayed far enough away to avoid trouble, though one man was arrested for trespassing and police found a gun in his car. In both places, the protesters said they opposed the president's plans for healthcare but meant him no harm. ""An armed society is a polite society,"" said William Kostric. Should people be allowed to own guns? Sound off below . Lately, the United States has been anything but polite. The healthcare reform plan has sparked the angriest opposition that the president has encountered since taking office. Most of the ire has been directed at lawmakers, who have also been meeting voters to discuss the plan. They've been interrupted, insulted and threatened. Obama doesn't attend those meetings but he's hardly overlooked. A protester outside one meeting held up a sign saying ""Death to Obama"" and ""Death to Michelle and her two stupid kids."" Is the president in danger? When it comes to armed protesters standing outside a building while the president is inside, a Secret Service spokesman told CNN ""of course not."" But Americans remember the assassinations of presidents from Abraham Lincoln to John Kennedy and the attack that wounded Ronald Reagan. Now, Barack Obama's trips across the country to talk about health may be attracting people with guns. It's an odd and unsettling thing.","Anti-Obama protesters demonstrate with weapons near where president speaking .

"London (CNN) -- After four nights of violence, an eerie calm descended Wednesday and continued into Thursday in Britain, where a massive police presence backed by strong words from the prime minister and vigilante efforts appeared to be having their intended effect. ""A fightback is under way,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday after meeting with his crisis-response committee. Cameron said police have been authorized to use whatever means necessary to combat ""despicable violence,"" with plastic bullets permitted and plans in place for water cannon to be available if needed. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, Cameron said those involved in the unrest would be held accountable, and he stressed that the ""pockets of our society that are not just broken, but are frankly sick,"" must regain a sense of personal responsibility. It was ""all too clear we have a big problem with gangs,"" he said, adding that authorities would not ""let any phony concerns about human rights"" prevent police from trying to identify suspects. For a second consecutive night, 16,000 police blanketed London's streets Wednesday into Thursday. Some residents weren't depending on them: In West London, young Sikhs stood guard outside their temple. North of the city, in Enfield, local residents chased after suspected looters. Riot police faced off not with looters but with local residents whose anger verged on mob violence. Such efforts were not always appreciated by police. ""My officers need to focus on rioters and looters, not those vigilantes,"" said Steve Kavanagh, deputy assistant for the London Metropolitan Police. ""The ones that help us are the community representatives who go and speak to people from their community and get them away and get them home, not people who threaten violence on anyone coming into their community."" Police said residents could help them by identifying photographs of looting suspects on Facebook pages like catchalooter. In Birmingham, police were treating a hit-and-run incident in which three men died as a murder inquiry. The men -- British Pakistanis -- were returning at 1 a.m. Wednesday from prayers to a gas station they were protecting when they were hit by the car. They have been identified as Shazad Hussein, 31; his brother Munir Hussein, 30; and Haroon Jahan, 20. One man has been arrested, and a vehicle was recovered, police said. Though police had not announced any link between the rioting and the incident, it heightened already high tensions in the area. Afterward, about 1,000 police flooded the neighborhood, where the father of one of the dead men tried to calm area residents. ""I lost my son,"" Tarik Jahan said. ""Blacks, Asians, whites. We all live in the same community. Why do we have to kill one another? What started these riots, and what's escalated them? Why are we doing this? I lost my son. Step forward if you want to lose your sons. Otherwise, calm down and go home. Please!"" Also Wednesday, police identified a 26-year-old man who had been discovered shot in the head Monday night in a vehicle in the south London town of Croydon as Trevor Ellis. He was taken to a hospital, where he died Tuesday. Initial inquiries indicate he had traveled earlier Monday with friends to the Croydon area, where they became involved in a dispute with a group of some nine other people, police said. The dispute led to a pursuit involving three vehicles, after which Ellis was shot, said police, who appealed to any witnesses to come forward. Two men were arrested at the scene on suspicion of handling stolen goods and were released on bail, a police statement said. Some people were using social media to get the city back on its feet. @RiotCleanUp was organizing neighbors and giving them brooms in the hope that community solidarity would keep the violence at bay. Hundreds of people took to London streets to clean up broken glass and debris left by looters. Sarah Driver-Jowitt, 37, who lives in an 18th-floor apartment in the Clapham Junction area, said she saw fires across south London from Clapham to Croydon on Monday night -- and joined the cleanup. ""I feel really strongly that the only way to respond to disorder is with civil order,"" she said. ""They're just a bunch of people who find it exciting to be destructive."" London's Metropolitan Police Service said it had arrested 820 people in connection with violence, disorder and looting, of whom 279 have been charged with crimes. More than 100 police officers have been injured. Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday that 113 people -- ages 15 to 58 -- had been arrested after a night of unrest in Manchester and Salford. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said he was appalled by the rioters' ""shameful actions"" in Salford and Manchester. ""These people have nothing to protest against -- there is no sense of injustice or any spark that has led to this. It is, pure and simple, acts of criminal behavior which are the worst I have seen on this scale,"" he said. The violence comes against a backdrop of austerity measures and budget cuts. But Cameron, community leaders and police have repeatedly pointed to a criminal, rather than political, motivation for the looting. The violence began Saturday after a protest over the August 4 shooting death of a man in an incident involving police in north London. Officers from Operation Trident -- a Metropolitan Police unit that deals with gun crime in the black community -- stopped a cab carrying 29-year-old Mark Duggan, a black man, in the working-class, predominantly Afro-Caribbean district of Tottenham during an attempted arrest, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said. Soon after, shots were fired and Duggan, a father of four, was killed. Shooting deaths are rare in England. The man's family and friends, who blamed police for the death, gathered peacefully Saturday outside the Tottenham police station to protest. The protest soon devolved into violence as demonstrators -- including whites and blacks -- tossed petrol bombs, looted stores and burned police cars. On subsequent nights, the violence spread to other areas of Britain. Police characterized the disorder as ""copycat criminal activity"" by people intent on looting and destruction. Analysts say a mix of economic and social tensions has been at play in the unrest, with deprivation a key factor. Those seen taking part in rioting and looting have been from diverse ethnic backgrounds and span a wide range of ages, and many are young. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Dan Rivers, Jonathan Wald, Atika Shubert, Carol Jordan, David Wilkinson, Anna Stewart, Ed Payne and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 820 people have been arrested in London .

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""The working title, as of right now, is 'Get Well Soon Everybody,' "" Jeff Tweedy, the singer-songwriter-leader of Wilco, says of his band's eighth studio album, now in the mixing stage at the group's Chicago studio, the Loft, and due for release in September. ""If I could say anything to the world at large, that would be it."" The record will be Wilco's first on their own label, dBpm -- shorthand for decibels per minute -- and Tweedy's third set of new songs with his longest-running lineup: bassist John Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, drummer Glenn Kotche, keyboard player Mikael Jorgenson and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansome. The group has recorded more than 20 songs, Tweedy says, ""out of the things I had coming in, which was somewhere in the fifties and sixties. It's a pretty great time for me writing-wise."" After Wilco finished touring last year, ""we took a little more time off the road than we normally do,"" says Tweedy. ""Certainly, it's been the longest break I've had since my twenties, and that's been a big help, wading out that far from the comfort of the old songs. You have to keep your mind sharp to play your old songs. It's hard to allow yourself to freely think about what you want to do next, when you're that close to doing another show."" The album includes a seven-minute track, ""Art of Almost,"" which starts with shadowy electronics, gently turns into a haunted vocal section, then sprints into a Krautrock-style blowout. There are also two country-flavored songs, the spectral ballad ""Black Moon"" and the jauntier ""Whole Love."" ""There are two strong threads of material,"" Tweedy says, ""one being a little weirder -- snot-nosed obnoxious pop songs -- and the other more languid, atmospheric-country music."" ""Whole Love"" grew out of ""a chord progression I found interesting,"" he notes. But the arrangements are the product ""of six guys being pretty remarkable at communicating without talking and having a lot of trust in each other."" Tweedy points out that the name of Wilco's label -- to be distributed by ANTI -- was originally a working title for the 2004 album, ""A Ghost Is Born."" ""It doesn't make any sense,"" he admits.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or ACA) was signed into law March 23, 2010, passed by a Democratic congressional majority and championed by President Obama. It has about 2,700 pages and contains 450 some provisions. Here are the four issues that will be addressed by the Supreme Court during six hours of oral arguments Monday though Wednesday: . One: The Anti-Injunction Act (the gateway issue) 10 a.m. ET Monday, 90 minutes of oral arguments . Here the critical question: Would those challenging the law be barred from making any legal or constitutional claims until the key provision -- the individual mandate (see below) -- actually goes into effect in 2014? The Anti-Injunction Act, in place since the 19th century, bars claimants from asking for a refund on a tax until that tax has been collected and paid. Judges in two federal appeals courts have made that ""threshold"" argument, which would effectively stop the current legal fight in its tracks. Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' Citing that law might give the court -- particularly conservative members -- a way out of deciding the explosive issue in an election year. The majority could decide the political branches can best resolve the conflicts, at least for now, or that the matter can be handled after the November elections. Some court watchers have called this the health care ""sleeper issue."" It could potentially delay a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate for at least four years. Two: Individual Mandate (the key issue) 10 a.m. ET Tuesday, two hours of oral arguments . This provision requires nearly all Americans to buy some form of health insurance beginning in 2014 or face financial penalties. May the federal government, under the Constitution's Commerce Clause, regulate economic ""inactivity""? Three federal appeals courts have found the PPACA to be constitutional, while another has said it is not, labeling it ""breathtaking in its expansive scope."" That ""circuit split"" all but assured the Supreme Court would step in and decide the matter. An insider's guide: How the Supreme Court works . A coalition of 26 states led by Florida say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a ""product"" they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department has countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not ""choose"" to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. Three: Severability (the domino effect issue) 10 a.m. ET Wednesday, 90 minutes of oral arguments . If the individual mandate section is ruled unconstitutional, must the entire law collapse as well? A federal judge in Florida had so ruled in February 2011: ""Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire Act must be declared void."" But a federal appeals court subsequently overruled on the severability question, while upholding the individual mandate's unconstitutionality. Opponents of the law say the individual mandate is crucial to its overall impact, since it is the main funding mechanism for the expansion of a range of other programs. This might be the one question on which the justices will ultimately agree in favor of the government. Four: Medicaid ""coercion"" (the national policy implications issue) 1 p.m. ET Wednesday, one hour of oral arguments . This hearing will look at whether states can be forced by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse. The 28 GOP-led states bringing separate lawsuits say the new law's significant expansion of the social safety net unconstitutionally ""coerces"" state governments. That program is administered by the states with a combination of federal and state money, currently requiring coverage only for poor children and their parents or caretakers, adults with disabilities and poor individuals 65 or older. The ""coercion"" issue was surprisingly added to the health care debate by the justices. The overall impact . Both sides of the issue agree what the high court decides on these four questions could have monumental implications for the regulatory ability of the federal government to set long-term national policy goals in areas such as the environment, education and the workplace. Some states have long complained their autonomy is being eroded by creeping federal intervention on spending matters. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power ""lay and collect ... taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States"" and to ""regulate commerce ... among the several states."" Such authority has long been broadly interpreted, including when imposing conditions on recipients, be they individuals or states. No federal court has ever ruled states have been unlawfully coerced when they accept conditions or strings attached to federal funds. The Supreme Court in 1987 affirmed that congressional discretion. Frequently asked questions: A CNN guide . Starting in 2014, PPACA's Medicaid changes would make millions of additional Americans eligible for benefits by raising the income level they earn and still qualify. That would include all adults up to 133% of the federal poverty line. The tricky question is that states are not forced to agree to the law's incremental Medicaid increases, spread out over six years. But the states say abandoning their participation as a result would be a financial, social and political catastrophe -- one which they cannot realistically foresee. Their needy citizens rely on Medicaid, states argue, but the law's expansion of the program could cripple state budgets, currently on average about 20%. That could threaten other state spending priorities. So the long-standing fight over ""federalism"" and the leverage the national government wields over states might soon reach epic levels with a high court decision either strengthening or limiting congressional authority on this and potentially a host of other regulatory areas.","Issue one: Will those opposed to the law have to wait until 2014 to challenge it?
Issue two: Is the individual mandate requiring coverage constitutional?
Issue three: If the mandate is struck down, does it sink the whole reform with it?
Issue four: Can states be forced by federal government to expand Medicaid?"
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate was called to order for 11 seconds on Wednesday as the last political scuffle of the year between the White House and the Democratic-led Congress played out. Democratic senators will hold short ""pro forma"" sessions over the holiday break to prevent recess appointments. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday last week, but Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments -- a constitutional mechanism that allows the president, during congressional recesses, to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, opened and then immediately gaveled the Senate session to a close. He spent 57 seconds in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of ""pro forma"" sessions through mid-January. Talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of those appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official, Steven Bradbury, as the permanent head of the influential Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Bush declined to accept the Democrats' offer, and Reid refused to approve Bradbury because of concerns about his involvement in crafting legal opinions for the administration on interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects. Similar sessions were conducted over the Thanksgiving recess. Webb also did the duty Friday, but he won't be the only senator tasked with presiding over the shortened sessions. Other Democrats -- including Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Chuck Schumer of New York -- will share the duty.

"(CNN) -- Over the past few months, newspapers, websites and cable news programs have implied 2010 would be a year of remarkable progress for women in politics. With a record number of women running for the U.S. House (138) and U.S. Senate (15), pundits, pollsters and politicians assumed it was the dawn of a new day, one in which Democrats and Republicans understood the importance of electing women. High-profile female candidates, many with interesting personal stories and personality traits, fostered the speculation that 2010 might very well be another ""Year of the Woman."" But it wasn't. In fact, Wednesday morning's headlines did not even mention women. Obviously, Democratic losses and Republican's ascent correctly took center stage. But some important points about women in politics slipped through the cracks. First and foremost, for the first time in 30 years, the number of women serving in the U.S. House of Representatives will likely decrease. A few contests remain too close to call. Democratic incumbents Melissa Bean and Gabrielle Giffords are fighting to hold onto their seats. Republican challengers Ann Buerkle and Ruth McClung are trailing by only a few thousand votes to the male incumbents they hope to unseat. But only if women win all of these races (an unlikely scenario) will the total number of women serving in the House hold steady at 73. The story in the U.S. Senate is similar. Depending on the outcome of Lisa Murkowski's write-in bid in Alaska, women will either continue to occupy 17 seats or they will drop to 16. Therefore, the best-case scenario for women's overall representation is they will continue to comprise 17 percent of Congress. Second, a net loss of women in Congress was a likely outcome heading into election night. We just did not seem to talk much about it. In an election cycle in which women competed for fewer than one-third of the 435 seats at stake in the House and only 15 seats in the Senate, substantial or even incremental gains for women were almost impossible. And because 77 percent of the women in the House and Senate were Democrats, women were in a particularly precarious position as they faced an anti-Democratic, anti-establishment electorate. The election results are consistent with what the political landscape portended. In the House, at least nine female Democratic incumbents lost their races. That number may climb to 11 when the votes are fully tallied. Only one out of 28 female Democratic challengers knocked off a Republican incumbent. And six of the nine Democratic women running in open seats lost their bids. Democratic women held four of their five seats in the Senate, although no female Democratic challengers or open-seat candidates won. Importantly, Democratic women fared no worse than their male Democratic counterparts; of course, their male Democratic counterparts did not fare well. The only way to compensate for these losses would have been with substantial increases of women in the House and Senate on the Republican side of the aisle. That did not happen. The National Republican Congressional Committee ran women in only three of the 30 races that presented the best opportunities to gain seats. So even though all 15 female Republican incumbents who sought re-election won and even with victories by six Republican women challengers and two Republican women competing in open-seat contests, the opportunity for gains was minimal. Republican women will continue to comprise just 9 percent of their caucus in the new Congress. Third, the loss of Democratic control in the House is especially detrimental for women because opportunities for leadership positions are based on seniority. Not only will Nancy Pelosi no longer be speaker of the House, but Louise Slaughter, Nydia Velazquez and Zoe Lofgren will also no longer serve as committee chairs. Early reports of the new Republican leadership include no women's names. I do not want to minimize that last night's elections resulted in an increase of the total number of Republican women in Congress. And I have no interest in detracting attention from the successes several women saw last night. Nikki Haley, for instance, became South Carolina's first female governor. Susana Martinez's win in the New Mexico gubernatorial race means that she will be the first Latina ever to occupy a governor's mansion. Cases such as these, however, are few and far between. Focusing on those wins obscures the reality that 2010 did not represent another ""Year of the Woman."" It likely moved us backward on the path to gender parity. The opinion expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Lawless.","Jennifer Lawless: Number of female candidates made 2010 seem like big year for women .

"DETROIT, Michigan (CNN) -- Jeremy Burgess likes the location and layout of the three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath home in the Grandmont neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan. This home in Detroit, Michigan, was bought for $12,000 and sold the next week for a $5,000 profit. The home is large for the area, around 1,600 square feet. By far the most attractive feature for Burgess is the price. While he says it may appraise at around $110,000, he bought it on March 11 for a mere $12,000. ""I'm selling it next week to an out-of-state investor for a little over $17,000,"" he says. His company, Urban Detroit Wholesalers, buys, renovates, then flips or rents homes in Detroit, something that may seem foolhardy to some observers in one of the most economically depressed cities in the nation. But Burgess, who started the company in 2007 with partner Jared Pomranky, says Detroit is a great place for real estate investment. ""Detroit to me is like the wild, wild West,"" he says, ""You can't get cheap land in the West anymore. The cheap land is in the Midwest now.""  Watch how cheap houses are pulling investors to Detroit Â» . Browsing through the real estate ads in Detroit can be depressing. Property owners, whether they are individuals or banks, are doing anything they can to sell unwanted homes. With so much of the local economy tied to the struggling Big Three automakers, some owners inside the city limits have resorted to offering homes for as little as a dollar, many for $50. The average is about $7,000. Burgess says there is a reason these homes are so cheap. Most listings are in economically depressed neighborhoods where people are trying to leave, not buy. ""I have seen tons of $50 houses,"" Burgess says, ""but the house needs $80,000 of worth of work, and you can't get an appraisal above $8,000."" He says the prices on those homes are so ridiculously low because owners just want to get rid of the tax burden and the liability of owning them. It costs more to tear down these homes than the property is worth, so it's cheaper to give them away. ""Out of [the most recent] 800 sales, 10 of them will be true sales to home owners and the rest will be distress sales,"" he says, pointing out the low percentage of homes sold in a normal business transaction in the city. Pomranky says contrary to Detroit's national image, there are still clean, well-kept, middle-class areas people want to live in. ""What we do is invest in neighborhoods that people are moving to,"" he says. They target mostly middle-class neighborhoods on the far northwestern and northeastern edges of the city. The homes in these neighborhoods have stayed relatively high in value. Many of the homes are foreclosures. Some properties are bought from homeowners who have lost their jobs, and a few have been donated to nonprofit organizations, which then sell them to Burgess' company. Pomranky says the attraction is the price point and the opportunity, something often missed by local investors. ""Many investors in Michigan and especially Detroit, they are a little too close to see the opportunity,"" he says. Their investors are coming from out of state, mostly the West Coast and California, and occasionally from out of the country. Many of them are looking for alternatives to investing in the stock market. Many homes are sold to investors for around $35,000 after they have been renovated. ""Some go straight to rentals, some go to rent-to-own lease options,"" Pomranky says. ""And some are sold to new homeowners. It's about a 60 percent rental to 40 percent homeowners."" Burgess says his company can get a 12 percent to 20 percent return on its investment and that outside investment money benefits more than just the buyers and sellers. ""All this money is spent in Detroit. I live in Detroit. Our office is in Detroit,"" he says. ""The Home Depot where all the materials are bought is in Detroit,"" he says. ""Everyone hired, 95 percent of them live in Detroit. So we are paying them. I would say that 90 percent of it stays inside the city of Detroit."" In 2006, Burgess was a supermarket baker in Washington state, trying to invest in local real estate. But high buy-in costs and high appreciation made success difficult. A friend of his in Detroit was making money in investing and told him to try his luck there. ""I thought he was crazy, and I am the type of person who has to prove it. The more I tried to prove him wrong about Detroit, the more I proved him right."" Burgess ended up buying around a dozen properties in Detroit before he came to Michigan. But when he finally did move to Detroit, the bottom fell out of the national housing market. ""I showed up in Detroit with about $35,000, a bunch of properties going on and a lot of financing options."" He says ""by October [2007] I had nothing."" That same year he met Pomranky and formed Urban Detroit Wholesalers. Together they retooled the business model and found that working with a local nonprofit and in targeted neighborhoods helped both succeed. Burgess says because there was never a housing boom in Detroit like California, the market stayed relatively stable. But when financing dried up, prices fell. ""This last drop I think is totally due to lack of financing options, and when cash is king, prices drop significantly. I see it as an artificial drop in value, and I am obviously taking advantage of it. So are my investors."" He believes that the prices will go back up when the credit market loosens up and home owners are able to secure their own financing. Despite being in the middle of rebuilding their business, Burgess and Pomranky say they made money in 2008. But for them it wasn't just about making a quick buck. They say they knew for their continued success, Detroit had to prosper, too. So they teamed with a nonprofit organization called the Motor City Blight Busters, which provides a low-cost work force that renovates the homes for Urban Detroit Wholesalers to sell. ""It is our goal to stabilize and revitalize the neighborhoods."" says John George, president of the organization. ""By being able to partner with investors, it allows us to expand our capacity to do what we do. ""Acquiring the property and cleaning them out, restoring them and putting a responsible family in that home is really key to stabilizing and revitalizing,"" George says. He wants to see more home ownership by local families in these neighborhoods, but he knows that may take some time. ""We always focus on home ownership. That's key,"" he says. ""But in this market we have to invite everyone to participate."" Most of the labor force is made up of recently released convicts looking for a trade and a chance to earn a living. Some of the homes they renovate are being donated to Blight Busters, which then place families in them. Burgess thinks teaming a for-profit business and a nonprofit is a win-win scenario. ""I think this is a perfect example of what a nonprofit and a for-profit with investors can do to solve a problem that governments are having a problem solving. While 100 or so homes we do a year is significant in Detroit, we realize that we're barely a blip on the national radar. But imagine if there were hundreds of companies like ours across the country.""","Jeremy Burgess and Jared Pomranky run Urban Detroit Wholesalers .

"Prague, Czech Republic (CNN) -- Fireworks and rock 'n' roll echoed across central Prague on Tuesday as thousands of marchers commemorated the 20th anniversary of the ""Velvet Revolution"" that toppled Communist rule. The peaceful 1989 uprising began with a student march to mark a 1939 clampdown on opposition in what was then Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. It drew 15,000 people -- students as well as teachers, professors and ordinary Czechs who had grown weary of state control. Ivan Pilip, one of the students who took part, said the march ""was very different"" from previous demonstrations he had joined. ""There was a different group of people,"" he said. ""We feel that people that participated in such events before had come, and they're ready to do something. And it was more and more visible every minute."" The protest was held a week after the opening of the Berlin Wall, as pressure was building on the Communist governments of Eastern Europe. When the demonstrators tried to divert the march to central Prague's Wenceslas Square, they were attacked by police -- a response that led tens of thousands more people to join mass demonstrations that lasted another 10 days. ""My kids cannot understand today what was moving our minds and hearts that day 20 years ago,"" Pilip's wife, Lucie, said Tuesday. ""We watched television today to show them what we had come through these 20 years, and I think it's an enormous success."" The protests led to talks between government officials and the Civic Forum, a group of dissidents led by playwright Vaclav Havel. The Communist Party ceded power in December, and Havel became president. ""Many of our citizens who took part in the democratic changes died already with a feeling that they contributed to something that meant a lot,"" Havel said Tuesday. ""In our ordinary, daily lives, we tend to forget our friends of that time -- our comrades, free-thinking individuals."" The anniversary march was capped by a concert that featured dissident musicians of the day, along with American folk singer Joan Baez. Havel himself appeared onstage with a guitar, but told the crowd, ""Don't worry, the guitar doesn't mean I'm going to play today."" Musicians, actors and other artists played major roles in the protests. Michael Kocab, now the Czech Republic government's human rights minister, was a rock singer who became the revolutionaries' key negotiator. ""In the beginning there was many times this idea, 'What am I doing here,'"" Kocab told CNN recently. ""I knew in the future I'd get used to it. And five or 10 days later, I forgot I was a musician and I submerged myself in political negotiations. And I liked it."" The celebration was organized by Opona, a nonprofit group established to observe the milestone anniversary of the dismantling of the Iron Curtain. ""Our inspiration to do this was from our memories -- we still remember the times that preceded the events,"" said David Gaydecka, one of the organizers. ""We believe that the changes in those 20 years have been positive despite all those maladies which came along with the freedom."" -- CNN's Phil Black and Fionnuala Sweeney contributed to this report.","Czech students take to the streets to mark 20th anniversary of fall of communist rule .

"(CNN) -- After six months, 35 pounds of chicken breast and more than a hundred hours of exercising, Jason Dinant finally sees the fruits of his labor. There are six of them. The left image shows Jason Dinant in January. The right one shows him six months after exercising and dieting. Dinant, an iReport contributor who lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, revamped his lifestyle to get six-pack abs in six months. Before, Dinant never exercised and frequently gorged on processed and junk food. Although he was already skinny, Dinant wanted to get a more chiseled figure for his 10-year high school reunion and his blog called Naked Boy News, where he comments on current events while standing shirtless. Since January, CNNhealth has followed the progress of three iReport contributors, including Dinant, as they strive to meet their diet and fitness goals. During the last six months, Dinant jogged, lifted weights and exercised his core. He gave up his favorite Peppermint Patties, chocolate bars and cookies in favor of zucchini, chicken breasts and 16 egg whites a day. He gave up his Coca-Cola for water. ""It has really become a way of life,"" Dinant said. ""I've seen such good results. I feel so much better, seen such positive results. There's no way I can go back to junk food and not working out. It's been a life-changing experience."" See Dinant's iReport submission. Detractors called his goal shallow and told him to wear a shirt, but Dinant was not easily discouraged. ""If your friends say negative comments, don't pay attention,"" he said. ""A lot of people aren't motivated to do this. It's not that they don't want you to succeed, but it's just they don't have the motivation to do it themselves. Sometimes friends unintentionally put negativity out there. Listen to your internal self and know not to give up."" Dinant's new abs have landed him a spot on the New York City Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March, where he will ride a convertible (and show off his six-pack) on Sunday. His car is to be accompanied by rows of shirtless men. But exercise physiologist Pete McCall, of the American Council on Exercise, showed concern when he saw Dinant's before-and-after photo. While McCall neither met nor examined Dinant, and viewed him only through photographs, he noted that Dinant looked a bit ""emaciated."" Dinant says he has lost 3 pounds. People with too little body fat could be considered unhealthy, McCall said.  He recommended that men have 7 to 8 percent body fat and that women have 12 to 14 percent. ""A six-pack should be the result of a consistent exercise program and a nutritious, well-balanced eating strategy, not the sole purpose of a training program and crash diet,"" he said. Many mistake six-pack abs as a symbol for fitness. ""Having big, defined muscles doesn't necessarily mean it's a harbinger of good health or mean they're strong,"" McCall said. ""It's purely aesthetics."" When a client talks about getting a six-pack, McCall would ask, ""How does that change your life? How does having defined abs make your life better? Are you stronger or more efficient at something?"" Dinant said the ab regimen helped him adopt a healthier diet, going from zero servings of fruits and vegetables to five a day. ""Now I crave fresh fruit and vegetables,"" Dinant said. ""I will crave zucchini like a snack. I'll cut it up then steam it. I've been having peaches, apricots and plums. Plums are my new best friend."" Once a person has achieved a six-pack, he or she has to maintain the physique through routine daily exercise, McCall said. For people who are trying to get healthier, McCall recommended taking on performance-based goals rather than aesthetic ones. Dancers and athletes have the best-toned bodies, ""because they train for dance or sports,"" he said. ""Basically, form follows function,"" he said. ""If you put your aesthetic appearance first, you're trying to train for the mirror. You're never 100 percent happy with what you see. You always notice a flaw."" McCall suggested forming goals such as being able to run a certain distance or doing a number of pull-ups or push-ups to shift the focus from appearances to fitness. ""I feel 100 percent comfortable with my body,"" Dinant said.  ""This is the best New Year's resolution I ever had in my entire life.""","Jason Dinant, an iReport contributor, revamped his lifestyle to get six-pack abs .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- Two years ago, Karen Daniel was wider around than she was tall. ""It's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit,"" says Karen Daniel who has lost 175 pounds. Weighing 375 pounds, the 45-year-old wife and mother had high blood pressure; her knees hurt and she was always hot. She felt fatigued and could barely breathe at the slightest exertion. Even the simplest things became a chore -- tying her shoes, crossing her legs, getting in and out of the car or trying to fit into a chair with arms. ""I wasn't living ... I was just existing,"" recalled Daniel. She hadn't always struggled with her weight. Daniel said she started gaining weight at age 18 after moving out of her parents' home to live on her own. By the time she married her husband, Paul, at age 22, she weighed 225 pounds. ""Whenever something happened, I used food,"" said Daniel. ""It was like my drug of choice was food. I never did drugs or alcohol. I was addicted to food."" Seven months after her wedding and another 50 pounds later, Daniel became pregnant with her first child. Instead of gaining weight during the pregnancy, she lost 75 pounds after a doctor warned her not to use it as an excuse to eat. But after her daughter Sarah was born, Daniel gained back all the weight she'd lost and then some. Ten years later, she weighed 300 pounds and became pregnant with their second child, Mckenna. Again, she lost weight during the pregnancy, but with the stress of having another child and running her own business, she turned to food. By the time her youngest daughter was 10 years old, Daniel weighed 375 pounds. ""I ate all the time. ... I was stuffing my emotions, I was eating my emotions,"" said Daniel. ""When I would finally get [Mckenna] to bed at night, I would stay up late and that was my time alone. I tried to de-stress and wind down and I'd watch TV and eat. It was mindless eating."" Mentally, something started to click and Daniel began to wonder how and why she had allowed her weight to spiral out of control. She said there was no ""lightbulb"" moment or wake-up call that made her realize she'd had enough. For her, there was a series of events that helped her finally realize she was tired of being morbidly obese.  Watch Karen Daniel take flight to achieve a lifelong dream Â» . ""I couldn't bend over to tie my shoes, get down on the ground or fit into chairs. Everything was hard,"" said Daniel. ""You're constantly worried about fitting on the toilet or in the shower or visiting someone's house and [worrying] about breaking a chair. It affects every minute of your life and you don't realize it."" As fate would have it, she saw a TV commercial for exercise equipment that was being sold at a local gym. It was geared toward senior citizens, but Daniel saw it as a start. When she showed up to buy it, she met the gym's owner, Bill Crawford. ""He gave me some of his literature and told me if I needed anything or a jump-start to give him a call,"" said Daniel.  See Daniel's before-and-after photos Â» . When Daniel got home, she told her sister, Jan, she was thinking about hiring Crawford as her personal trainer, but she was hesitant. Her sister asked if she would have to think twice about hiring a trainer if it were for her husband or daughters. ""She made me realize I was worth it as much as they were,"" said Daniel, whose fear of failure kept her from telling people outside her family about her plans to work out. On September 15, 2006, Daniel showed up for her first training session. She was wearing a dress over her workout clothes because she refused to be seen in size 40W pants. ""When Karen first walked in the door, she weighed 375 pounds and she could barely make it from the car to the front door,"" recalled Crawford, founder of Basic Training in Phoenix, Arizona. ""I knew that just making it to the front door of a fitness center was a big deal."" Before her first workout, Crawford took her measurements, but the tape measure wasn't long enough to fit around her hips. He needed seven more inches. ""I was 67 inches around on my butt and 65 inches tall. So I was two inches bigger around than I was tall,"" said Daniel, who had a body fat percentage of 54.60 percent. ""I also couldn't fit on his scale or in some of his machines when I started."" Crawford and Daniel improvised and she made it through her first hourlong workout. She continued to train for one hour, three times a week and said even though she ""hated every minute of it"" she pushed herself. ""It was extremely hard, I'm not gonna lie,"" said Daniel. ""I couldn't count down the minutes fast enough. It was something I did not enjoy -- I was so out of breath. I was sweaty, hot. But as soon as I stepped out that door, it was so worth it to me because I felt so much better about what I had accomplished. I knew I made it through one more workout. I knew it was getting me closer to where I wanted to be."" In addition to the one-on-one training sessions, Daniel modified her diet, eating more proteins and complex carbohydrates. She also eliminated bread and pasta and reduced her intake of sugar, salt and processed foods. If she craved something sweet, she ate a piece of fruit. She cooked with olive oil instead of butter. Just short of her one-year anniversary, she had lost 102 pounds. Her daughters gave her a Tiffany bracelet and her sister, Jan, treated her to her first pedicure. Crawford, her trainer, celebrated her success with a reminder. ""I had her take two 50-pound dumbbells and walk out to the street and walk back,"" recalled Crawford. ""When she got back she was exhausted and that's the kind of weight people have to carry when they're overweight like that."" On her one-year anniversary, Daniel had lost 114 pounds. By her two-year anniversary on September 15, 2008, she had lost 170 pounds. Now weighing around 200 pounds, she has gone from wearing a women's size 30 dress to a size 14 and she's gone from wearing a double-wide shoe to a medium width. Since losing the weight, Daniel has celebrated many milestones she never would have achieved weighing nearly 400 pounds, such as attending sporting events with her family, white-water rafting, kayaking, flying on an airplane without buying two tickets or using a seatbelt extender or simply being able to look down and see her feet. She recently achieved one of her lifelong dreams: riding in a hot air balloon over the Arizona desert.  Today, she works out nine times a week -- doing cardio and weight training twice a day with Crawford on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Then she does a mix of cardio and weight-resistance classes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.   Even though she now enjoys working out, staying on track is a constant struggle. Daniel said losing weight has been the hardest thing she's ever done.  ""Every minute of my life was about my weight. What I couldn't do. Things I couldn't accomplish,"" said Daniel, who admitted it was hard to get started. ""It's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit. Fit feels so good."" What's next for Daniel? She wants to lose 35 to 40 more pounds before her 48th birthday and keep adding to the list of things she wants to do to make sure she savors every moment. Most of all, Daniel hopes to inspire others by sharing her weight-loss story on her Web site, www.ihavebones.com. ""I just wish they would take the first step, because it's so worth it. Your life is so much better than worrying about where you're going to sit and how you're going to sit. You can actually ... enjoy life!""

"(CNN) -- Nearly one-fifth of American 4-year-olds are obese, and children of color are at higher risk, according to new research. Obese children are at risk for early onset of diabetes, fatty liver and musculoskeletal problems. Researchers calculated the body mass index from a sample of 8,550 Hispanic, black, white, Asian and Native American 4-year-olds. The children were born in 2001, and in 2005, their height and weight were measured -- 18.4 percent of them were obese. ""Significant differences in the prevalence of obesity between racial/ethnic groups were evident at 4 years of age,"" the researchers wrote in the April issue of the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. Using body mass index, they found that 31.2 percent of American Indian/Native Alaskans, 22 percent of Hispanics, 20.8 percent of blacks, 15.9 percent of whites and 12.8 percent of Asians were obese. ""It's surprising that there are large differences by racial/ethnic group by that age,"" said Sarah Anderson, an assistant professor of epidemiology at The Ohio State University and lead study author. Anderson and co-author Robert Whitaker's analysis showed that children were becoming obese even before encountering soda and candy vending machines in schools. ""These results really do point to the need for us to focus attention on early childhood and the need for research to understand how these differences can emerge so early,"" Anderson said. ""To do that, we may need to understand the different family and cultural factors that are at play in these children's lives."" The cause for the early health disparities is hard to pinpoint, childhood obesity experts said. ""It's always possible there are biological factors within ethnic groups,"" said Dr. Tom Robinson, director of the Center for Healthy Weight at the Stanford University School of Medicine. ""We know most of the changes that have occurred in body fat tend to occur from being in an environment that promotes very easy access to high-caloric foods and limited opportunities for physical activities."" Michael Rich, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, called the disparities between ethnic groups disturbing. ""The expectations, lifestyle, behaviors are different on a cultural and socioeconomic basis,"" he said. ""Kids who live in the inner city, whose neighborhoods are perceived as dangerous, stay at home more, sit more, eat more snacks, because that's all they can get at the local bodega. There are no supermarkets to get produce. That's what mom is eating, so that's what kid is eating. What we're dealing with here is whole life issues."" Previous research has shown that older children are becoming less active and spending more time in front of a computer or TV. ""That is displacing physical activity,"" said Dr. Sarah Barlow, director of the Obesity Center at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. ""You can imagine strollers, less outdoor play -- all those kinds of things that have shifted how much activity younger kids are getting. At the same time, portion sizes are increasing for everybody."" According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adults fare no better. Approximately 45 percent of blacks, 36.8 percent of Mexican Americans and 30 percent of whites are obese. ""It's a very bad sign if we see obesity at a young age,"" Robinson said. ""When we see children obese at age 4, we're likely to see complications -- high blood pressure, abnormal lipids -- which can lead to heart disease and stroke, diabetes in children."" Diseases commonly seen in 40- or 50-year-olds are presenting in 6- and 7-year-olds. Obese children are developing type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and musculoskeletal problems, which occur because their bodies can't carry that much weight, doctors said.  Calculate your child's body mass index. ""The heavier you are as a child, the likelier that extra weight will follow you through life,"" Robinson said. ""That's why we see adolescents who need weight-loss surgery, because they have life-threatening complications from obesity."" If you have an obese child... The first step is for the parents to acknowledge that the child is overweight, instead of making excuses or comparing him or her to heavier children. Many of the parents of obese children are overweight themselves, which makes that acknowledgment difficult, said Rich, who is also director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children's Hospital in Boston. ""While it's important to focus on it and take it seriously, it's also important not to give up or feel hopeless,"" he said. ""Then you won't try. You want to look at it for what it is and not be defeated by it."" When you're trying to help your child achieve a healthy weight, remove the stigma attached to obesity. ""It should always be about health, not about losing weight,"" Rich said. ""You're trying to build the positive."" He recommended the 5-2-1-0 plan. Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables, cut screen time down to two hours or less, exercise at least one hour, and have zero soda and sugary drinks. Such changes, which are not seismic shifts to lifestyles, can help the child get into a health weight. ""It's easier to start that way, rather than try to change habits when they're 8 or 12 or 16,"" said Barlow, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. While it's possible for some kids to outgrow the excess weight, she warned parents not to count on that. ""We've seen over time that the environment doesn't promote that,"" she said.","Research: 18.4 percent of 4-year-olds in the United States are obese.
Native Americans, Hispanics, blacks at most risk; whites and Asians at lowest risk .
Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors play a role in likelihood for obesity ."
"(CNN) -- Jason Dinant has the opposite problem of most Americans -- he has flat abs. Jason Dinant's New Year's resolution is to shape up his abs from flat to muscular. Standing 6-feet, Dinant has a beanpole leanness many Americans covet. The 27-year-old's ribs protrude from his chest, but he has some fat collecting in his stomach. ""I don't have that much body fat, but it tends to stick right here in my stomach,"" he said pinching his belly. ""My goal is to get a six-pack by summer,"" Dinant declared in a video he submitted to iReport.com. Dinant often peels off his shirt and gives what he calls ""the naked truth about today's news"" in Web videos he posts on his blog called ""Naked Boy News."" Watch Dinant's video. ""I give reports without a shirt on, so I should have the best body,"" he said.  ""Who wants to see a guy with skinny arms and no abs?"" CNNhealth.com recently asked viewers to talk about their New Year's resolutions on iReport.com and to upload photos and videos during their journey to change. Share your story with iReport.com. Dinant works in sales during the day and has a night job as an emcee at a Las Vegas, Nevada, night club, where he is surrounded by toned and fit dancers. ""There are go-go boys and girls with killer stomachs,"" Dinant said. ""I get up on the stage, I don't take my shirt off. I'm nervous about my stomach."" He doesn't mind going topless on his videos, but he gets self-conscious in person. With his high school reunion fast approaching this summer, Dinant wants to tone up in the next six months and develop chiseled abs like Shemar Moore of TV's ""Criminal Minds"" or Ty Pennington, host of ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition."" Until recently, the extent of Dinant's exercise has been walking up the stairs and parking his car far away from stores. Now Dinant works out four times a week in a gym inside his apartment complex, cycling on a stationary bike, using weights on his upper body and doing 500 sit-ups a day. A televised Britney Spears interview gave him the idea for the sit-ups routine. ""I heard her saying that she'd do 1,000 sit-ups a day,"" Dinant said. ""She had amazing abs. If she can do it, I can do it."" But the sit-ups get old, Dinant said. To distract himself, he watches TV shows such as ""The Bachelor"" while crunching, or he thinks of games (""Every time you do sit-up, you name an Osmond child"") to pass the time. Contrary to popular opinion, traditional sit-ups aren't the most effective way to get a six-pack, said Robert Dothard, a personal trainer based in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Crunches are great to flatten the stomach,"" he said.  ""For men, we have to put abs under weight resistance to make them stick out."" The ab segments that make up a six-pack exist under layers of fat and skin.  To make the six-pack more pronounced, a person has to exercise and lose the excess fat so those muscles are visible. That comes through cardio exercises. To make those stomach muscles bigger, ""abs have to be put under resistance,"" Dothard said.  Those muscles need weight training to become bigger and more prominent. He recommended doing sit-ups on a stability ball while holding a medicine ball over the head and crunching. Using a resistance band anchored around a stationary bar while performing side-to-side twists also creates resistance, he said. Dothard demonstrated these moves on a video.   Watch Dothard's fitness demonstrations. Â» . Someone with a svelte frame such as Dinant's may not look as if he or she needs to exercise, but appearances can be deceiving. ""People can be lean, but still carry a lot of fat,"" Dothard said. Research suggests that it's wise for even lean people to lose the belly fat. Even with a normal body mass index, people can carry extra weight in their stomachs, which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Those with belly fat have a higher risk of dying compared to their peers without it. But, Dinant's reasons for wanting a taut stomach remain purely aesthetic. ""I have my 10-year high school reunion coming up,"" Dinant said. ""I want to go back and be like, 'Bam. Look at me.'""","An iReporter with flat abs sets his goals this year for a six-pack .

"(CNN) -- Andrew Sable wasn't in the market for new wheels, but he says the federal ""cash for clunkers"" program helped him get an offer he couldn't refuse. ""I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" said Andrew Sable, who got $9,000 for his 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend. Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it, even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $2,000 at best. But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser. And Chrysler, eager to sell vehicles, threw in its own $4,500 incentive. The $9,000 in savings knocked the price to $8,900 before taxes and fees. ""I'll never get $9,000 for this old vehicle [any other way]. I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" the 43-year-old Sable, an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore, New York, told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com. He'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan. iReport.com: Read Sable's account of the purchase . Under the $1 billion program, people will be given credits of $3,500 to $4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient. The old vehicles are crushed or shredded.  Watch CNN's Gerri Willis explain the ""cash for clunkers"" program Â» . The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets. Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type. New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg. New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg. New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg. The government put Sable's old Jeep at 15 mpg. His new PT Cruiser, which the program classifies as an SUV, gets a combined 21 mpg. Part of the program's intent is to get vehicles with low fuel efficiency off the road. Caroline Radtke, a 31-year-old who wrote about her purchase on iReport.com, was happy to oblige. Radtke and her husband this month got a $4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper (15 mpg) to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen, a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg. After the credit, they paid just under $26,000. ""What was going out of my [old] vehicle was bad for the planet, and you're putting so much financially into the stupid thing to fill it up because it runs out so fast,"" Radtke, a freelance graphic designer living in San Antonio, Texas, told CNN after filing her iReport. ""After driving it for eight and a half years, I wanted something more productive financially and more friendly to the Earth."" The couple would have bought a new car without CARS, but the credit probably allowed them to get a nicer car than they otherwise would have, Radtke said. If they had sold the Trooper themselves, they might have gotten $3,000 if they were lucky, she said. iReport.com: Radtke's purchase . The CARS program isn't for everyone. The credit won't go toward used-car purchases. Also, people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it. But the program worked just fine for iReporter Julie Callahan, a Salt Lake City, Utah, woman who was looking to replace her 1990 Chevy C1500 pickup truck, which had more than 350,000 miles and is rated at 15 mpg. She and her husband already had a newer vehicle, but she used the truck to go to work and for other in-town purposes. But lately it started having shifting problems, and it was occasionally slipping going uphill. Like Sable, Callahan, 39, got $4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser. And, like Sable, she also received a separate $4,500 credit from Chrysler. She'll be paying about $10,000 for her new vehicle after taxes and fees. The $9,000 she saved with the credits from CARS and Chrysler isn't too shabby, considering she figures her old pickup was nearly worthless because it had so many miles. iReport.com: How Callahan got $9,000 for her truck . ""Without the incentives, I probably wouldn't have purchased a brand new vehicle,"" Callahan, who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah, told CNN after filing her iReport.

"(CNN) -- Susie Levitt's and Katie Shea's feet had had enough. Walking around Manhattan sidewalks between classes in their high heels was getting unbearable. Katie Shea and Susie Levitt,  founders of ""CitiSoles,"" said walking around Manhattan in high heels was painful. Tal Raviv felt frustrated. While studying in Hong Kong in 2007, he found that adjusting to a new city was hard enough. Even more aggravating was trying to  connect with friends on Facebook whose names were common. Jaun Calle and Adam Berlin were bored. Watching college football on television isn't as exciting as being there in person, they thought. Instead of just grinning and bearing it, all of these university students did something: They started their own businesses. Levitt and Shea created ""CitiSoles,"" a shoe company that makes a foldable shoe for when the pain of high heels gets unbearable. Raviv created ""DropCard"" an e-business card that lets users send more contact information than is commonly found on a business card. Calle and Berlin formed ""SEC Excursions"" a travel company that provides busing, tailgate parties and hotel accommodations to college football games. The recession and lack of experience might stop most adults in their tracks, but these students weren't discouraged. ""There is no better time [to start a business],"" said Christopher Hanks, director of the entrepreneurship program at the University of Georgia. ""During a depression or recession, innovation always increases."" The dorm is the new garage . While the founders of Google built success in their garages, these college students found it in their dorms. In addition to their course work, studying for midterms and balancing extracurricular activities, they wrote business proposals and figured out financing. ""From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., I am in chemical engineering classes, and from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m., I work on DropCard, so I don't get much free time,"" said Raviv, 22. Levitt and Shea said launching their shoe business was essentially nonstop, and the work didn't end on Friday. And for Calle, the compromises in his academic and social life weren't a burden. ""We enjoy ourselves,"" said Calle, 21. ""We don't see it as a sacrifice."" Hanks said these attitudes are typical of student entrepreneurs. They don't have the pressure of supporting themselves -- their living expenses are usually being paid for -- and they have a wide support system. ""They certainly have their advantages ... their enthusiasm level is really high,"" Hanks said. ""They don't know what they don't know."" Hanks added that the excitement of creating a business revs up the students even more than the chance of getting rich. ""They get excited about 'wouldn't it be cool if we did that' versus the money,"" said Hanks. ""The journey is not as much as about the money as about the challenge."" Figuring it out . None of these students followed a set formula for starting their businesses. Levitt and Shea used Alibaba.com, an online trade portal, to pitch their idea to suppliers and dipped into their savings for start-up money. An investment firm helped Raviv, and Calle and Berlin found investors. Levitt and Shea, both 22, took ""less than $10,000"" from their savings to start CitiSoles in 2008. That covered the cost of the shoes and a Web site designer. From there, they worked with suppliers and factories in Asia to scope out which would be the best fit for their company. The pair conducted market research and found nothing similar sold in the United States. ""It was all done online,"" Levitt said. ""We became nocturnal."" The shoes, made of imitation leather, come with a compact carrying case. A patent for the shoe is pending. When the first order for 1,000 pairs, weighing over 400 pounds, arrived at Shea's Long Island home unexpectedly, Levitt said they were overwhelmed.  A few days later, an article about their company appeared in the New York Daily News, but they weren't ready for the onslaught of orders. They quickly set up a PayPal account. ""From there, we got on the phone to boutiques, sent out retail kits and samples ... and now there are 17 boutiques around the nation selling them,"" said Levitt, who is studying economics and will graduate this fall. Her partner, Shea, double-majored in finance and marketing and graduated in May. Last summer, Raviv, along with two of his friends, applied for funding for their e-business cards with DreamIt Ventures in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. DreamIt is a ""business incubator"" that helps entrepreneurs launch companies. Raviv, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a chemical engineering degree in May, was honest with the investment firm when it asked how his e-business cards would make money. ""I actually don't know,"" Raviv told them. ""They said 'Perfect. Thank you. We know there is no possible way to know right now.' "" Raviv said the lack of a detailed business plan helped DreamIt see how it could assist them. They received $20,000 from DreamIt. DropCard initially targeted technology companies but went after ""old-fashioned"" businesses like car dealerships that proved to be more lucrative. DropCard is currently in trials with four companies to see how they can tweak their business plan. Feedback is instrumental in DropCard's growth. ""We refine everything instead of sitting back and strategizing,"" Raviv said. ""Let our customers write our business plan."" Calle, a senior at the University of Georgia who is pursuing a degree in business administration, launched SEC Excursions with a mix of investors and help from the Terry College of Business Entrepreneurship Program at UGA. Hanks helped Calle and Berlin in fleshing out their idea and making it potentially profitable. Started in July 2008, the company found success in a trial trip to Baton Rogue, Louisiana, for the UGA-Louisiana State University matchup. The first trip offered a two-night stay at a hotel, busing to the game and a tailgate party. The packages, which don't include tickets to the games, vary from $100 to  $300 a person. The company has contracts with bus companies and various hotel chains. It has student reps at four college campuses and plans to add more. Calle said the company's ""most loyal customers are in the Greek systems,"" but it's open to all students who wish to purchase a package. ""The students really like it because everything is planned for them,"" Calle said. ""We've heard nothing but good things.""","Susie Levitt and Katie Shea created a foldable-shoe company called ""CitiSoles""

"(CNN) -- ""Syndicate"" tries to remake a '90s title into a modern-day, first-person shooter and as far as gameplay mechanics go, it succeeds. But, visually, the game falls so short that it ends up being far from an enjoyable experience. The new game from Starbreeze Studios and Electronic Arts is a reboot of a 1993 title that was more of a tactical shooter and strategy game than a first-person shooter. This version drops you into a future where corporations, not countries, control the world, and most of Earth's population has been implanted with chips in their brains. Players act as techno-agents -- with super-charged chips designed to make them incredible warriors . This DART-6 chip technology is implanted in the brain of your character, Miles Kilo. Kilo is tasked with sniffing out corporate espionage and dealing with it -- permanently. The DART-6 makes Kilo more powerful and so fast that the world around him appears to be moving slower. He also gets additional enhancements early in the game that unleash three different powerful attacks -- suicide, backfire and persuade. Each of these abilities allows Kilo to tap into an enemy's chip and force them to do something against their will. The ""suicide"" ability causes a brain chip to explode, possibly injuring surrounding people. ""Backfire"" shorts out an opponent's weapon temporarily and makes them vulnerable to damage. And ""persuade"" gets enemies to switch sides and help out Kilo, before blowing their own brains out. Kilo also gets upgrades by stealing important chips from other people's skulls. The technique is rather disturbing, as the technology is removed through the ear or eye. It's done after the people are already dead, so at least there's that. These upgrades add to Kilo's health and recharge his power, shields and other skills and tools you'll need to complete your missions. From a shooter perspective, the action is solid with a wide range of weapons to collect and use. From a simple pistol to the powerful chain gun with infinite ammo, each weapon causes unique, and sometimes very visceral, damage. The chain gun literally cuts enemies in half. If you don't have a strong stomach, don't examine the bodies too closely. The enemies are numerous, so players will get plenty of practice with their weapons and abilities. Some strategy is needed in most scenarios, but on more than one occasion, the bad guys just kept coming down a hallway without any personal regard while I continued to mow them down. The boss battles were lengthy and difficult, requiring quite a bit of dodging, restocking and flat-out hiding. Kilo seems extraordinarily fragile for all his offensive firepower, so you will die often. Civilians aren't immune to all the bullets flying around, but from a game-play perspective, it was hard to determine whether I should care. There's no morality system that punishes or rewards player actions. I tried not to play like a psychopath, but the lines between good and bad get blurred on the way to the game's conclusion. And speaking of blurred ... The visual elements of ""Syndicate"" are, by far its most troubling. Yes, it is supposed to be a far-flung future, reminiscent of ""Deus Ex"" or even ""Tron."" But the way it's rendered was visually painful. Lens flare and extreme lighting made the game hard to enjoy. Even after adjusting the gamma and blackness controls, transitions from scene to scene often resulted in blinding brightness or darkness so intense that, when I turned away, I couldn't make out individual items on a desk. I spent more time in the video options menu than worrying about what skills I wanted to upgrade. Glitchy animation didn't help the visual experience, either. Onscreen characters would develop a case of the shakes that made it look like they were going through techno-DTs. On more than one occasion, enemy soldiers would appear to go down, only to spontaneously reappear shooting in the same location. Detail in the environments was impressive, but most of it was just for show. Walls and barriers would show bullet marks but not take any real damage. The multiplayer mode teams up two to four players on fairly typical missions. Cooperation is vital as the enemies appears single-minded in their desire to destroy you. It doesn't detract from the overall game, but it is important to get with people who know what they are doing. Those ""solo"" team members are just going to get themselves -- and you -- killed. Overall, ""Syndicate"" has solid, fun combat that requires creativity to overcome. But that's hampered by its visual style and glitchiness. If you can get past that, don't treat it as a reboot of the game you may have liked in the '90s. Treat it as something new, and you'll probably enjoy it more. ""Syndicate"" is available now in North America and February 24 in Europe on Windows PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is rated M for Mature because of blood and gore, intense violence, strong language and suggestive themes. This review was done using a review copy for the Xbox 360.","'Syndicate' is a reboot from a 1993 tactical shooter and strategy game .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- If the opening game of the 2010 World Cup was anything to go by, in which South Africa played out a compelling 1-1 draw with their Group A opponents Mexico, the power of soccer has managed to pull off an early victory. Football -- known locally as Diski -- has traditionally been a ""black"" sport in this region, so it was remarkable that of the 84,490 people that attended the match played on the outskirts of Soweto, so many were non-colored and, more specifically, white. Prior to kick-off, organizers had been vocal about their primary goal; to leave a legacy of greater unity between a people that had been divided for so much of their shared history. Historical paranoia and mistrust between racial groups had been rekindled in the republic as recently as April, when white supremacist leader Eugene Terreblanche was murdered in his farmhouse home. Mo Allie, a freelance football expert who writes for The Sowetan newspaper, told CNN: ""After the Terreblanche murder, people were predicting a civil war and bloodshed -- but that just hasn't materialized. ""People have put aside their differences, people on the streets are just smiling a lot more and the economic problems and racial divisions have been forgotten."" Ferial Haffajee, editor of City Press newspaper in South Africa, agreed with Allie's analysis: ""I think over the past month we've seen a crossing of racial boundaries that people did not think was possible after the murder of Terreblanche put us on the edge of a race war. People have really shown the enormous human capacity of reaching out to find what is common."" Though the organizers seemingly have reason to be pleased with the early progress made towards their goals, Haffajee told CNN the credit should not fall at the feet of world football's governing body FIFA or the South African government. ""I wouldn't attribute this to the organizers at all. What surprises me is this really does seem to have come from the ground. Forced attempts to make us reconcile -- where we're told to hold hands, to cross racial boundaries -- never work. But people have taken this World Cup into their own hands and made it their own."" Such views held by those in the domestic media certainly seemed to hold weight with the views of fans that spoke to CNN as they left the Soccer City Stadium after the game. Kate Oakley (white), 24, who works as a buyer in Johannesburg said: ""The World Cup has united South Africa because normally we think that white people don't come to see soccer -- but today it was everyone together. ""Rugby is normally white and soccer black, but a couple of weeks a go an Afrikaans rugby team from Pretoria played at the [Orlando] Pirates Stadium [in Soweto]-- and they had their vuvuzelas! It has been amazing some of the things that have happened."" Rob Matthews, a 59-year-old white office worker added: ""This was my first football game in South Africa. We came by train, which is traditionally transport for the black community but it was superb, we had an absolute ball and I would come again definitely. ""I think the community will mingle after the World Cup a bit more after this. I think that is far more important than economic benefit. A debt can be paid off but a community spirit is priceless."" Forty-one-year-old attorney, Chandesh Britlaw (Indian) added: ""Nights like tonight help to bring us together, from a people aspect the World Cup has been a big plus. I'm an Indian, but I'm a South African first."" Nboniseni Mathivha (black), a 35-year-old senior manager at Gauteng department of finance was already a regular spectator at domestic league games prior to the World Cup. He too welcomed a soccer crowd that better reflected South Africa's diverse population. ""The crowd [for the first game] had far more whites and Indians, it was very multiracial unlike the normal crowd which is mostly black. Most non-black football fans in South Africa worry about the security."" For Mathivha, the key to maintaining the momentum created in the build up to the World Cup is for football, as a sport, to be more proactive in its promotion; an action that could have benefits for the society more widely. ""We have to sell soccer in all communities, we need the white fans to go back and promote football in the white schools so that we can have more white players coming through to play. ""We have to progress -- I saw apartheid -- but my generation will fade away the new generations will come the stadiums together in the future,"" he told CNN. Ever since the ""Rainbow Nation"" was announced as the hosts of FIFA's showpiece in 2004, skeptics argued that areas in desperate need of investment and their resources were forsaken for the tournament. New stadiums were built at vast expense for a nation where over 40 percent of the population lives on two dollars a day. For many the key to creating a legacy will be how the good start to the World Cup is built on. ""I think it's unrealistic to expect more than a feel-good factor. Once the World Cup is done and when the ""white-elephant"" stadiums are left I don't think you can expect sport to unite the people on a permanent basis,"" Allie told CNN. ""You're still going to have people dissatisfied about living in poor conditions, the massive disparity between bosses and workers, and racial divides."" Haffajee added: ""Our national statistics show that black ownership of key levers of the economy and presence in management layers still has a long way to go. The income gap has still two generations to work on becoming closer. ""[However] the value of events that can bring the nation together, it is hard to put a price on that. It's the first time we've felt this kind of nationhood since 1994. ""But I would caution against building miracle moments because -- when you look at how feudal some parts of South Africa still is, when there is another murder of a farmer, or a farmer kills his workers -- it is easy for this to turn to a failure. ""Better to look at the small things, where people are reaching out to be friends, to fall in love and to marry -- this is the key progress. The hard work starts in July when the tournament packs up.""","The FIFA World Cup is bridging traditional racial divides in South Africa .
Many South African whites are attending football matches -- traditionally a ""black"" sport .
Racial unity allays fears recent killing of Eugene Terreblanche would rekindle clashes ."

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has issued a decree authorising a multi-party political system, state media reported Thursday, a day after the U.N. Security Council condemned the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters. The decree issued by Assad may have the power to bring to an end decades of single-party rule by the Baath Party in Syria, although it remains unclear how the new law will be implemented. The draft law was earlier passed by Syrian lawmakers, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported, and grants citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life ""through peaceful and democratic means."" However, the Syrian opposition has argued the decrees are simply for show and will not bring about real change. Assad's move comes as reports of violence continue to prompt international outrage. Security forces killed four people after evening prayers on Wednesday, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, one in the southwestern town of Nawa, in Daraa province, one in the central city of Palmyra, and two in Damascus. The observatory said communications remained cut off Thursday in the western city of Hama, a center of discontent and bastion of anti-government protest. The group is concerned that many civilians may have died, as the military remains in the city. The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. ""The Security Council condemns the widespread violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians by the Syrian authorities,"" the eight-paragraph statement says. It calls for ""all sides to act with utmost restraint, and to refrain from reprisals, including attacks against state institutions."" The statement says those responsible for the violence should be held accountable but offers no suggestion that foreign intervention is being considered. ""The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria,"" it says. ""It stresses that the only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, with the aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the population which will allow the full exercise of fundamental freedoms for its entire population, including that of expression and peaceful assembly."" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is to update the council on the situation in Syria within a week, welcomed the statement. ""The world has watched the deteriorating situation in Syria with the most profound concern, but the events of the past few days have been brutally shocking,"" he told reporters. ""Once again, I call on President (Bashar al-) Assad and the Syrian authorities to immediately cease all violence against their people, to fully respect human rights and implement reforms that they have already announced."" He urged Damascus to comply with the Security Council's demand that international humanitarian organizations be granted unimpeded access to affected areas. ""Those responsible should be held to account,"" he said. He praised the 15-nation Security Council for speaking out ""with one voice and condemning all this violence and asking them to take necessary measures"" after long discussions on the matter. But Lebanon's ambassador, Caroline Ziade, said her country, which is Syria's neighbor, dissociated itself from the statement. However, Lebanon chose not to block the measure, as it could have done. Resolutions usually carry with them some sort of action. Presidential statements are simply unanimous on-the-record positions. Though a resolution would have been more significant than the presidential statement, U.S. diplomats said they were glad the United Nations had taken a stance. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice called the statement ""long overdue."" She added that she hoped Damascus will ""be chastened by the strength and the unity of the condemnation."" The statement came on the third consecutive day of talks in New York to address the crisis, which a White House spokesman called ""grotesque and appalling."" Witnesses said Wednesday that security forces were brazenly advancing into the heart of Hama. Hama, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters in Friday demonstrations, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. The city is under siege by security forces amid a military offensive, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and witnesses say communications have been closed down amid the military push. Rami Abdul-Rahman of the observatory told CNN Thursday that 1,000 families had fled west to surrounding villages and 500 families eastwards, leaving a city where violence has persisted for days. His group monitors the unrest in Syria through many contacts on the ground, and his sources have reported hearing explosions and seeing plumes of smoke. ""There are great concerns of a massacre in the city,"" he said Wednesday. ""The human situation is very bad,"" said a witness from an opposition movement who said he was in the center of Hama and asked not to be named for security reasons. Corpses were seen on the ground after tanks occupied parts of central Hama amid heavy shelling, said a resident who fled the city. Dozens more people have been killed in Hama and other Syrian cities in recent days, rights groups have said. Residents said the city is running short on food. Power and water are scarce and residents said they fear a humanitarian crisis. Across Hama, intermittent gunfire and shelling rang out, helicopters whirled overhead and government snipers took positions, making it difficult for people to venture out, residents said. Security forces also launched a series of raids and detentions in the Khaldiyeh neighborhood of Homs, another western city, and dozens of people have been detained in the area, the scene of marches by anti-government protesters. Syria's parliament plans to meet Sunday to discuss ""issues related to the homeland and citizens' interests,"" SANA reported Wednesday. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to the country by international journalists, including CNN's. Since mid-March, anti-government protesters have taken to the streets across the whole country to demand reforms from or an end to the al-Assad's regime. The death toll in Syria since its uprising began in mid-March has reached 2,003, the observatory's Abdul-Rahman said. The dead include 1,629 civilians and 374 Syrian security forces. The figure doesn't include tolls from the Wednesday unrest in the city of Hama, where it is difficult confirming information because of the ongoing military offensive there. Activists blame the deaths of demonstrators on security forces, but the government has consistently attributed the violence to ""armed groups.""

"SILVER SPRING, Maryland (CNN)  -- Thomas Cuddy enlisted in the U.S. Army 28 years ago, but he's facing his greatest battle now that he's out. Retired veteran Thomas Cuddy is so weakened by ALS that he often can't catch himself when he slips. Cuddy spends most of his days in his small apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland, reading on his couch, and working at his computer. He leaves only when it is absolutely necessary; the trek down the three flights of stairs is exhausting and dangerous. He slips easily, and he does not have the strength to catch himself. Thomas suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the legendary baseball star who lent his name to the mysterious illness over 60 years ago. His doctors have told him to stop working but he cannot afford to, so he works when his body will let him. He is able to work from home most days -- he's a community relations officer, command speechwriter and medical publications reviewer based at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. But as typing becomes an increasingly strenuous chore, even this will become too much to bear. Thomas hopes this day comes later rather than sooner. Sitting idly is not is his nature, but ever so slightly, that is changing. ""This is a disease where...one day you wake up and you can walk, and the next day you can't,"" he says. ""And once you lose it, you can never get it back."" ALS is a progressive disease that attacks neurons in the brain, eventually leading to total paralysis. It affects 20,000 to 30,000 Americans at any given time, according to the ALS Association. It can take up to 10 years to fully develop, but by the time it is diagnosed, it is usually fatal within two to five years. ALS was first classified as a disease in 1869, yet there are still few clues as to its cause. Researchers are just as far from finding an effective treatment or cure. In fact, just one drug has been approved by the FDA to treat ALS, and has been proved only to extend life by a few months. ""They have no idea what is happening to us. I'm taking it one day at a time,"" Thomas says. Thomas has found that many of his brothers suffer from the illness as well -- his fellow veterans, that is. ""There have been recent studies that have been proven that if you are a veteran, your chances of developing ALS are double that of anyone else,"" Thomas says. Dr. Mark Weisskopf, an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that doctors took notice as a large number of veterans of the first Gulf War began to report ""non-specific neurological conditions."" Several subsequent studies published in the last decade have established an increased rate of ALS among Gulf War veterans. Weisskopf was co-author of a study in 2005 that found that men with any history of military service are about 60 percent more likely to develop ALS than men who did not serve in the military. He concluded that ""the branch, length of service, and where you served didn't seem to matter."" The cause of this connection is still unknown. Weisskopf says that there may be an environmental trigger, but due to the immensity of potential exposures to which military personnel are subjected, no one has been able to pinpoint exactly what that trigger might be. For men who are trained to fight for their lives, this disease is perhaps the ultimate torture. ""The way we are in the military, if you show us an enemy, we'll defeat it, ""Thomas says. ""It's really hard to identify what you're fighting. I'm just fighting to stay alive."" The Department of Veterans Affairs established ALS as a service-connected disease on September 23, 2008. This acknowledgment gives veterans suffering from ALS access to much-needed benefits such as health care, disability compensation, and many other essential support systems. While it may seem as if the VA has moved slowly in reacting to these studies, Weisskopf notes that there is still a lot that is unknown about the connection between ALS and military service. ""In that regard, I commend the VA in taking this step before many scientists are fully convinced,"" Weisskopf says. Nonetheless, for those suffering from ALS, navigating the vast bureaucracy at the VA can be an exasperating process. Veterans such as Thomas find themselves in the helpless position of watching their disease advance at a much faster pace than their paperwork. When he filed for disability last March, Thomas was told that his request could take up to a year to be approved -- if it is approved. For now he waits. Despite his deteriorating condition, Thomas has chosen to remain positive. Each day, he carefully gets out of bed and tests his legs, hopeful that he is able to walk for one more day. He is all too aware that he will wake up one day soon and his limbs will no longer work. Someday, he will lose the ability to talk, and eventually, he will stop breathing. But today, he can do all of these things, and he is grateful. ""What I do all day long, is I tell myself in six months, I will probably be in much worse condition, and in six months I would give anything to be where I am today,"" he says. ""So today I'm happy with what I have.""","ALS, a progressive disease, attacks brain neurons leading to total paralysis .

"(CNN) -- Steve Carlotta's family-owned camera store is struggling along with other mom and pop stores. But he's found a way to compete with Internet stores and big-box chains. A sampling of one and five BerkShare notes, courtesy of Jason Houston Photography. Carlotta's store accepts BerkShares -- a local currency in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He credits it with helping keep local customers coming back to his store. And as U.S. dollars and credit vanish in this economic crisis, more communities are looking into printing their own currencies. This concept isn't new. During the Great Depression dozens of complementary currencies flourished as thousands of banks failed. Today, it's estimated there are at least 2,500 complementary currency systems around the world, says Bernard Lietaer, a co-founder of the Euro and a local currency proponent.  Watch how one town uses their own currency Â» . In the United States, there are alternative currency systems in California, Wisconsin, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Massachusetts. BerkShares are a form of local currency developed in the Berkshire region of Massachusetts two years ago.  About 350 merchants accept BerkShares in addition to U.S. currency. People pay 95 federal cents to get one BerkShare or $95 for 100 BerkShares. Complementary currencies are colorful slips of paper designed with images of local scenes or landmarks. People can use this currency to purchase local goods and services. It's designed to encourage locals to spend money within their own area. Paul Glover, the founder of the Ithaca Hours complementary currency for use in Ithaca, New York, has been bombarded with requests to help set up local currencies around the country. ""As the economy has fallen apart, my phone has been ringing off the hook,"" Glover says from his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Printing and distributing local currency isn't illegal. But there are rules, says Lewis Solomon, a law professor at George Washington University. First, the currency can only be paper; no coins are allowed. And the currency can't resemble a dollar. Finally, any income received in local currency must be taxed as if it were federal dollars. While local currency may not be helpful outside a town's limits, residents say they use the money as a way of supporting their local community. Stephen Burke, the current director of Ithaca Hours, accepts the currency at his music store. He spends his Hours locally, too. Some like to know they're helping a small business stay in business and compete with big chains that may not care about the community. ""Recently people have begun to understand the value of spending money locally,"" Burke says. And businesses, in turn, use local currency as a way to promote their connection to the community and build loyalty. The 5 percent discount with BerkShares probably doesn't hurt either. Susan Witt, the co-founder of BerkShares, has been consulting with officials from Newark, New Jersey, and nonprofit groups in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Alaska on how to start local currencies. ""The trouble in our global financial system has people very concerned,"" says Witt. ""They don't know how to fix it. It seems out of their control. The concept of a citizen group taking responsibility for its own regional economy and finding a way to issue a medium for exchange in its own area is such a powerful image."" Gwen Colgrove, a retired teacher in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, is trying to garner support for a local currency in her area. ""I think the time is critical with the financial collapse,"" she says. However, there are challenges. Some community members dismiss the idea of a local currency, arguing that it won't have much of an impact in a global economy. The local currency Colgrove is trying to launch is still only in the beginning stages. But thanks to the economy, residents are more enthusiastic about creating their own medium of exchange. ""If the economy were booming, people wouldn't be so interested,"" she says. But creating a local currency isn't easy. First, there are the start-up costs. Witt's group spent $250,000 in grant money to create the BerkShares. There are costs associated with designing a currency, printing costs, the costs of educating residents and businesses. And maintaining the whole program is expensive. Witt estimates Newark could spend about $1 million in implementing a local currency. And then there's the labor. ""You have to have someone at the helm. Someone who is paid."" says Glover. ""A lot of communities start out with dedicated people. They get it going, but because they are all volunteers, the reality of having created a financial institution sinks in. And eventually, they just get exhausted."" Just printing the right amount of local currency is difficult. If you print too much currency, there's the possibility of inflation. If you print too little, there are no economic advantages. Glover admits he started out idealistically. ""When I started Ithaca Hours, I thought I was releasing money like doves of peace that would fly around and land on people's shoulders,"" he says. Some economists are skeptical that complementary currencies will ever have much impact. ""They usually don't hold up too well, or too long,"" says Bert Ely, a banking analyst. ""It's something that applies only in simple and closed situations. It lacks the flexibility and geographic breadth that currency has."" While there is a lot of idealism out there, local currencies usually break down, Ely says. And since the early 1990s, there have been about a dozen local currencies that have failed in the United States. To be sure, local currencies are a small part of the economic activity in a region. Witt estimates about $2 million in BerkShares that have circulated since the bills were first printed. She says currently there is about a 30 percent usage rate among residents. Jon Zaglin, the director of the Humboldt complementary currency project in California, says there's about $130,000 in Humboldt currency that has been in circulation since 2005. But advocates say that it's not the scale of the program that makes it important. It's about the connections that form around it. ""The bigger effect of BerkShares is the conversations it's elicited,"" Witt says. ""It's a way to network and have healthy conversations about money,"" Burke says. ""Ithaca Hours acts as money, but there is something beyond that."" ""It creates camaraderie,"" he says. ""When someone comes into my store ... if they pay with a check or a credit card, we don't talk. But when someone uses Ithaca Hours, you start a conversation."" And that keeps customers coming back.","Some communities are printing their own currency for local use .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb-and-gun rampage in Norway last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial Monday. Anders Behring Breivik raised his arm in a fascist-style salute -- a symbol of ""strength, power and defiance against Marxist tyrants,"" to quote the 1,500-page manifesto attributed to him -- as soon as his handcuffs were removed in court Monday. ""I acknowledge the acts but do not plead guilty,"" he told the court. His trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror is expected to last up to 10 weeks. He is accused of setting off a bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people, then fatally shooting 69 people at a youth camp run by the ruling Labour Party on nearby Utoya Island. Dressed in a black suit and sporting a jawline beard, Breivik listened impassively as prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh read the charges, describing how dozens of young people were shot to death. Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, said his lawyer, Geir Lippestad. In his manifesto, Breivik railed against Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including the Labour Party, which he said was allowing the ""Islamification of Europe."" And in court, he called the trial political and objected to the judge's friendship with a former justice minister. ""I do not recognize the Norwegian court. You've gotten your mandate from political parties that support multiculturalism,"" he said. ""OK, we will make a note of that general objection,"" Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen said curtly. Prosecutors played a recording of a terrified girl phoning for help during the shooting rampage, a recording punctuated by constant firing in the background. They also showed security camera video of the central Oslo bomb blast that killed eight people, images that participants in the trial watched with ashen faces. Breivik sat in court without restraints, behind a bulletproof glass barrier set up to protect him during the six hours of proceedings. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg vowed to double down on Norway's traditions of liberal democracy in response to the attacks, and Breivik's trial appears to be no exception. ""He was so close to having a bullet between his eyes. The police were so close,"" said Jorn Overby, who rescued some 15 people from the waters off Utoya during the massacre. But Overby told CNN that he owes Breivik only ""a punch in the face for firing at me."" ""He will get the treatment he needs,"" Overby said. Experts have given different opinions about Breivik's sanity, which will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Norway does not have the death penalty, and sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. But Breivik's defense will try to prove he was sane at the time of the killings, Lippestad said Monday. Lippestad told reporters after the hearing that the defendant had his reasons, but would not disclose them. It is important to Breivik that he be considered sane, Lippestad said after the hearing. Prosecutors outlined Breivik's life before the killings, showing a photo of the messy room where he lived at his mother's house, listing his six failed businesses and referring to his many hours playing the online game ""World of Warcraft."" Prosecutors said he had ""no job, no salary, no money from the government"" and was ""living off his savings."" The defendant smiled briefly when his ""Warcraft"" character was shown, one of the few times he showed emotion on Monday. He also appeared to be overcome with emotion, fighting back tears, when part of his video manifesto ""Knights Templar 2083"" was played in court. Lippestad declined to say why Breivik wept, citing attorney-client privilege. But lawyers for the victims said: ""No one thought he was crying for the victims."" A survivor of Utoya Island, Tore Sinding Bekkedal, said he was surprised to experience ""a strange feeling of relief"" when prosecutors switched from listing the names of the dead to those of the wounded. ""It was an intense gratitude, Bekkedal said during a break in the proceedings. ""It took me by surprise that I felt it, that these wonderful people are still among us, that we managed to save these ones at least."" Breivik is to begin testifying Tuesday, and asked Monday for his testimony to be broadcast, claiming it as a human right. Most of the relatives of the victims do not want that to happen, according to lawyers who represent the families of victims and survivors. ""It's going to be 10 weeks of hell ... to hear this man, to hear his explanation of why he did it and how he did it,"" said Trond Henry Blattmann, whose son was killed on Utoya Island. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined that Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. However, the court sought a second opinion because of the importance of the question of sanity to Breivik's trial. In a report released this month, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said Breivik was sane at the time of the killings. The victims on Utoya Island were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp, the same camp Stoltenberg said he had attended every summer since 1974. ""I think that one of the main messages from Norway after the tragedy ... was that we were going to protect our democracy. And part of our democracy is the divisions of responsibilities between the government and the courts. It's up to the courts to decide whether this man is going to be sentenced or not, whether he is insane or not. It's not a question which is going to be decided by politicians. That's part of our democratic society,"" Stoltenberg said. Tore Bjorgo, a terror expert and professor at Norwegian Police University College, said Breivik appears to be overly concerned about his self-image and sees himself in the role of a ""fantastic, great person who will save Europe."" ""It's we who should decide what kind of a society we want; it's not the terrorists,"" he said. ""And the logic of terrorism is to try to provoke responses to get people to act in ways the terrorists want, and it was important that we didn't do that. We didn't go down that road, and that was, I think, a big victory."" CNN's Per Nyberg and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: Survivor says he owes Breivik ""a punch in the face""

"(CNN) -- The loose organization of hackers known as Anonymous released Friday a recording of a telephone call between the FBI and Scotland Yard that it said it recorded surreptitiously. The group posted the 16-minute conference call on one of its websites. The FBI and Scotland Yard acknowledged that the released recording was intended to be a private conversation, but blamed no particular group. A U.S. law enforcement source said the conversation was recorded after an e-mail that circulated Jan. 13 to the conference call participants was intercepted when one of those participants forwarded it to a personal e-mail account. ""It's not that sophisticated,"" the source said. ""It's like vandalism."" ""The information was intended for law enforcement officers only and was illegally obtained,"" the FBI said in a statement. ""A criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible."" In the recording, law enforcement officials can be heard discussing advances in investigations into hackers. Some of the names of the hackers are bleeped out in the recording, while others are not. The law enforcement source told CNN that the call took place on January 17, and concerned an investigation by British authorities into the LulzSec hacker group. The official said that no FBI computer systems were hacked. The agency has been investigating Anonymous for more than a year. Also on Friday, Anonymous announced that it planned to release e-mails related to the 2005 deaths of 24 unarmed Iraqi civilians during a U.S. military raid in Haditha. Anonymous posted online that it has hacked into Puckett & Faraj, a law firm representing one of the soldiers involved in the Haditha incident. The hackers say they have stolen 2.6 gigabytes of information from the firm including ""detailed records, transcripts, testimony, trial evidence, and legal defense donation records,"" the online announcement said. The law firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"MAASTRICHT, The Netherlands (CNN) -- It has been a while since I've enjoyed going to church so much. The Cathedral of Saint Servatius is still a major attraction for pilgrims. As a lapsed Catholic I tend to keep my church attendances to Christmas and, if I'm feeling quite a lot of guilt, Easter. However, I would happily go to ""church"" at Maastricht's Kruisherenhotel on a daily basis. A former gothic church and monastery dating from the 15th century, the buildings have been beautifully renovated to welcome disciples of a new kind of religion -- luxury. Boasting 60 rooms, dazzling but sympathetic light installations and a mezzanine restaurant and accompanying womb-like wine bar in the church's nave, it's easy to be quickly converted. The food is also pretty good; my fish and scallops starter followed by venison the perfect communion for a late autumn evening. The Kruisherenhotel, though, is only one of Maastricht's many gems. The southern Netherlands city of 120,000 people does not feature prominently on many lists of must-visit places, but it should. An easy train journey from Brussels and Amsterdam and a mid-distance journey from London, Paris and several German stations, Maastricht is laden with good restaurants (there are four Michelin-starred eateries), shopping, history, public art and surrounded by pretty villages with woodland walking paths. The city center, like a miniature Paris, is split in two by the Maas river. Roman history and a Latin Quarter featuring boutiques and art galleries dominate the left bank, while on the right the Bonnefanten -- a contemporary art museum -- and hip retro design shops hold forth. The religious theme continues on the left bank at Selexyz Dominicanen -- yet another church that has been converted, this time into a fabulous English- and Dutch-language book store. Originally built in the 13th century by the Dominican order, its most recent use before 2007's spectacular renovation was as an indoor bike pound. It now features a three-story black steel bookstack in the high nave, together with a noisy cafe in the choir. If it sounds like desecration, you couldn't be more wrong. It is a book and architecture lover's heaven on Earth. As proud locals tell my wife and me, there are plenty of empty churches in the area that could do with a similar makeover. Book browsing is hungry and thirsty work, but there are plenty of options for a prolonged stop: pull up a chair at one of the many cafes that surround the city's squares or head for the Mosae Gusto underground food hall. Typically food halls give me the willies; bad food cooked hours earlier, reheated and served up for the masses. The Mosae Gusto is the complete opposite. It gathers high-end outlets together, giving you the chance to take away delicious food or eat in and watch your meal being prepared in the open kitchens. If it's more traditional French-influenced food with a tasty flourish you are after, then head for the welcoming La Courage on the Rechtstraat, one of the city's oldest streets. Refueled and clearly with a blessed life to give thanks for, we stop off at a church that is still used for its original purpose. The imposing Cathedral of Saint Servatius, originally founded in the 6th century, is the oldest church in The Netherlands, though it was substantially rebuilt and enlarged between the 11th and 15th centuries. Saint Servatius, responsible for spreading Catholicism to the Low Countries and a diplomat in the fourth century, is buried in the crypt and his relics (i.e. bits of his bone fragment) spookily feature in the basilica's treasury. In times of distress, his relics were carried around the town -- a procession which is now carried out every seven years. The cathedral draws many pilgrims, with Pope John Paul II once a visitor in 1984. Having given our praise we make a quick stop at Maastricht's ceramic museum, where the brilliant World Press photo exhibition is in residence. The museum, a stone's throw from the river, is surrounded by tasteful inner-city apartments and close to the striking Bonnefanten, where art works by modern and old masters find a comfortable home together. Unfortunately, it's a bit too early for us to be eating again, so we return to our hotel and the countryside around the village of Houthem-St.Gerlach -- a 10-minute train ride outside Maastricht. Local residents are out running and cycling, while others walk their dogs to the nearest pub; everyone says hello. The area is dotted with caves, some of which were once inhabited and a few can be toured. Across the road from our hotel, Vue de Montagne, is the entrance to La Caverne de Geulhem -- a series of caves it uses as a restaurant and to host functions for as many as 400 people. In a way, the caves are a metaphor for Maastricht; its delights may have been a secret for some time, but it's a pilgrimage well worth making.","Maastricht, a southern Dutch city, is full of fantastic restaurants and sights .

"(CNN) -- The storied British soccer team Manchester United said Tuesday that it plans to raise about $100 million in an initial public offering of its shares in the United States. News reports last year had linked the club, where the England star Wayne Rooney plays, with a possible listing in Singapore. But in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, Manchester United said it aimed to sell shares in the homeland of its American owners, the Glazer family. The team has one of the most powerful brands in world sport and has won 60 trophies in its 134-year history. But since the Glazers, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bought the team in 2005, it has accrued a high level of debt. Manchester United to sign Dortmund's Japan star Kagawa . Manchester United said in the filing Tuesday that it had generated revenue of 331.4 million pounds ($519 million) in the financial year ended June 2011. But at the end of March this year, its total indebtedness stood at 423.3 million pounds ($663 million). The club said it would use the proceeds from the planned share offering to pay off some of its debt. On the field, the team had an ultimately frustrating 2011-12 season. It lost out on the English Premier League title to its local rival, Manchester City, on the last day of the season, and failed to qualify from the group stage of the European Champions League. The SEC filing did not specify when the planned listing would take place. The filing described the maximum offering size of $100 million as ""estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee,"" suggesting it could change in the future.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane experts are throwing cold water on an idea backed by billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates aimed at controlling the weather. Bill Gates and scientists have applied for patents aimed at reducing the strength of oncoming hurricanes. Gates and a dozen other scientists have raised eyebrows by submitting patent applications for a technology to reduce the danger of approaching hurricanes by cooling ocean temperatures. It's a noble idea, given the horrible memories from Hurricane Katrina, which slammed into the Gulf Coast four years ago this week. The storm, which rated a frightening Category 3 when it made landfall in Louisiana, was blamed for $81 billion in damaged and destroyed property and the deaths of more than 1,800 men, women and children. Skeptics applaud the motive of the concept but question its feasibility. ""The enormity of it, in order to do something effective, we'd have to do something at a scale that humans have never really done before,"" said Gabriel Vecchi, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. How exactly would this hurricane-zapping technology work? Hurricanes are fueled by warm water, and cooling the waters surrounding a storm would slow a storm's momentum. According to the patents, many tub-like barges would be placed directly in the path of an oncoming storm. Each barge would have two conduits, each 500 feet long. One conduit would push the warm water from the ocean's surface down. The other would bring up cold water where it lies deep undersea. World renowned hurricane expert William Gray, who's been studying and predicting the storms for a half-century, also doubts whether the proposal would work. ""The problem is the storms come up so rapidly,"" said Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University. ""You only get two to three days warning. It's very difficult to bring up enough cold water in two to three days to have much effect."" The idea itself isn't groundbreaking, according to Gray, who said it could only be feasible if the barges were put into place at the beginning of hurricane season with the idea that storms will come. ""But you might do all that, and perhaps no storms would come. That's an economic problem,"" Gray said. Even if the technology does work, Gray said it won't completely halt a hurricane. ""There is no way to stop it. The storm might weaken in the center, but the outer areas wouldn't be affected much."" And flooding and storm surges are determined by these outer winds, Gray said. When word of Gates' five patent applications first made headlines in July, alarmed bloggers lit up the Internet, expressing fears that playing with ocean temperatures could lead to catastrophe, possibly forcing a storm in a different direction. That's not likely, said Kerry Emanuel, a professor in atmospheric sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""You're doing something to the ocean that the hurricane would have done anyway,"" Emanuel said. Cold water that churns up during a storm slows down a hurricane naturally. But the coldest water is usually at the rear of the storm, so sometimes it's too late to weaken [the storm], Emanuel said. ""The key is doing it a little sooner than the storm itself does it and make [the hurricane] weaker than it would have been,"" he said. ""There are enough experiments to find out whether hurricanes' natural cooling could steer the storm in a different location, and the answer is no, or it's a very small chance."" While Emanuel believes the physics are conceivable, he says the cost of implementing the system shouldn't outweigh the benefit. ""This would only be practical if the amount [of money] you spend doing this would be less than the damage caused by the hurricane,"" Emanuel said. Gates and scientist Ken Caldeira, both listed as inventors on the patents, did not respond to CNN's requests to comment about their venture. The patents, which were only made public last month by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office, were filed in January by Searete LLC. The company is a subsidiary of Intellectual Ventures, an invention firm run by Microsoft's former chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold. A spokeswoman for Intellectual Ventures, which holds about 27,000 technology patents, didn't elaborate on the cost associated with the patent. ""At this point, there are no plans for deployment, so there is no talk of funding,"" she said, adding that it could take up to 18 months for the patent application to be approved. Regardless, inventors say that this technology is not something they'll be rushing to use anytime soon. ""This type of technology is not something humankind would use as a 'Plan A' or 'Plan B,'"" Paul ""Pablos"" Holman, an inventor in the Intellectual Ventures laboratory, wrote on the company blog. ""These inventions are a 'Plan C,' where humans decide that we've exhausted all our behavior changing and alternative energy options and need to rely on mitigation technologies. If our planet is in this severe situation, then our belief is that we should not be starting from scratch at investigating mitigation options."" Hurricane expert Gray agrees. ""I don't think this is anything that's going to be done in the next few decades in a practical sense, but maybe further down the line,"" Gray said. ""I would love to see Bill Gates, with all his money, use some of it to experiment.""","Hurricane experts doubt feasibility of Bill Gates-backed weather-control idea .

"(EW.com) -- ""Savages"" is Oliver Stone doing what he should have done a long time ago: making a tricky, amoral, down-and-dirty crime thriller that's blessedly free of any social, topical or political relevance. How liberated from an agenda is this movie? It's about two marijuana dealers in Laguna Beach who run afoul of a Mexican drug cartel, and the film has nothing at all to say about either undocumented immigrants or the war on drugs. Yet you can feel how alive Stone is to the material. He stamps every scene with his darkly combustible cinematic personality. Based on a novel by Don Winslow, ""Savages"" is grandiose underworld pulp staged with screw-tightening skill and a taste for nasty kicks that spills over into sadism and dread. It's like a jacked-up ""Miami Vice"" told from the point of view of the criminals. The film is narrated, in a ""Sunset Boulevard""-meets-""Kill Bill"" way, by Ophelia (Blake Lively), known as O, a free-spirited California blonde who lives with, and loves, two guys and is their anything-goes siren-goddess. Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a scarred, sexy hunk of an Afghanistan war vet, is the tougher and more volatile of the men. His friend and business partner, the gentler Ben (Aaron Johnson), is a wispy-bearded nihilist hippie. The two went into the drug game together with a crop of ''primo'' marijuana seeds that Chon smuggled back from Afghanistan after enlisting in the military for that purpose. They've harvested those seeds into a greenhouse crop that yields weed with THC levels of 33% (the best high anyone's ever had). But the popularity of their product threatens the cartel's business, which is why the gangsters come calling like a vicious corporation that talks ''partnership'' when it means ''hostile takeover.'' Run by a ruthless matriarch (Salma Hayek) from her hacienda, the cartel issues a warning in the form of a creepy Internet video of a dungeon full of freshly decapitated victims. But Chon and Ben are too arrogant to know what they're dealing with. So the gangsters kidnap O and place her in the dungeon, where they threaten to hack off her fingers. ""Savages"" is violent enough to risk turning off a portion of the audience. Yet even as the movie descends into blood-spattered exploitation, it's revving up the suspense. When characters are threatened with stuff this brutal, you'd better believe there's something at stake. To get O back, Chon and Ben must become masterminds and warriors. They have to descend into savagery themselves. Stone presents some bravura set pieces, from a pulse-quickening encounter with a highway cop to an incendiary multivehicle heist to every scene with Benicio Del Toro as a very scary sociopath. As for Taylor Kitsch, he wipes away any lingering John Carter cobwebs with his explosive performance, and John Travolta is funny and desperate as a DEA agent up to his ears in slime. Exciting as it is, ""Savages"" does slide off the rails during the last half hour. The film goes from intense to indulgent, plausible to preposterous.

"(CNN) -- Hours before Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes faced another court hearing, his lawyers Thursday asked the presiding judge to reject a request by media organizations, including CNN, to unseal the full court record in the case. In a document submitted to Arapaho County District Judge William Sylvester, Holmes' lawyers said unsealing the entire court record would jeopardize the ability of the defendant to get a fair trial. Sylvester has allowed the public release of documents in the case but kept many others under seal. CNN is one of 17 news organizations asking Sylvester to make the rest of the court record public, particularly affidavits for probable cause involving search warrants that already have been executed. Read more: Why did Colorado shooting suspect avoid social media? Holmes' lawyers also called Thursday for a court website to stop listing publicly available documents in the case. ""While documents that are unsealed may be accessible at the courthouse, posting them online in a specially-dedicated section of this website is inconsistent with both the judicial branch's obligation to ensure that Mr. Holmes receives a fair trial somewhere in the state of Colorado, as well as with this Court's orders limiting pre-trial publicity in this case,"" Holmes' lawyers argued. Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire in an Aurora movie theater during a screening of the new Batman film on July 20, killing 12 people and wounding 58. He was charged last week with murder and attempted murder, and also faces two weapons charges.

Suspect Luka Magnotta is in Canada awaiting trial on first-degree murder and other charges in the case. Police have said they believe Magnotta filmed Lin's death and dismemberment and posted the video to the Internet. They say the 10-minute video also shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and includes evidence of cannibalism. Opinion: The sick fascination with a death video .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Even surrounded by hundreds of her flamboyant outfits, Dame Vivienne Westwood cuts an attention-grabbing figure. Presenting a world of fashion to Anjali Rao, Vivienne Westwood was happiest to talk about practically anything else. In Hong Kong for the opening of a traveling retrospective of her work, she arrived at the exhibition, her characteristic red hair contrasting with her pale complexion, with a small entourage of suitably fashionable and vaguely mysterious looking characters in tow. As she folded herself into a chair for the Talk Asia interview, the entourage settled in the background -- some blending in with the grand designs of the exhibition, others, like Carlo, a small, bald man wearing dark glasses, providing more of a contrast. Things didn't begin as well as they could have. Wearing a splendid pair of high heels and a black wrap dress with cuts and slashes entwined with what looked to an untutored eye to be medical bandages, Dame Vivienne found the large, soft-looking armchair too hard and uncomfortable. It was duly swapped for a small plastic chair that looked hard and uncomfortable, but was more to her liking, taking to it like a fakir to a bed of nails. More comfortable then but not quite settled, the first question was greeted by a long pause and then a moment of mild panic for the production crew as she shut her eyes and put her head in her hands. But it wasn't the question apparently, it was the too-cold and too-noisy air conditioning that wasn't right. ""I'm very sensitive to noise,"" she said in her Yorkshire accent, before apologizing for having to change things about before she could start properly. ""I'm alright when I get going,"" she said with a reassuring smile. Softly spoken, many answers were peppered with pauses, hmms and rhetorical ""what am I trying says,"" which often made it seem as if she'd never been asked some of the questions before. More likely was that she was trying to approach them in a new way, making a different cut from an old pattern. ""I've got a terrible memory; it's probably because I'm always concentrating on what I'm doing now,"" she said in some way to explain her individual interview style, but probably revealed as much about how she's managed to be so consistently imaginative and inventive over the years. Carlo from the entourage was eventually banished from her eyeline after one too many smirks and giggles at the mention of her former husband and partner in punk, Malcolm McLaren. She warmed most to the interview when she had the opportunity to express her views on everything apart from fashion, from how lucky the British are to have Prince Charles to the state of the media: ""It's all boring. Journalists are usually quite jealous people, especially of intellectuals who are supposed to be in fashion."" At one point a few ""anyways"" and ""what am I trying to says"" led on to an enthusiastic extolling of a particular Chinese painting as the high point of human existence before things went on to how art hasn't moved on since 17th century Dutch paintings and how young people today don't have any imagination. As for her relationship with her partner Andreas Kronthaler, who wasn't part of the day's entourage: ""He couldn't stand it if I was talking like this at home now, he'd be off in the kitchen or doing something else. But he's the most stimulating person I know."" While she was happy to talk about individual pieces of clothing at the exhibition, she was generally more content to pontificate than talk about punk, proving that in herself she was truer to the ethos of the term than the fashion style she helped popularize.","Interview in Hong Kong at opening of retrospective exhibition of her work .

"(CNN)  -- Caster Semenya, the athlete at the center of a gender row, has appeared in a photo glamour shoot in her native South Africa. The front cover of You magazine has Semenya as the main feature. The 18-year-old is awaiting the results of a gender verification test ordered by the IAAF, the governing body for athletics, following her triumph in the women's 800m at world championships in Berlin. Her muscular build and deep voice, coupled with a stunning improvement in performance to win the global title, had led to questions about her gender. It emerged shortly before the 800m final in Berlin last month that the IAAF were conducting tests, sparking a controversy that shows no sign of abating. Semenya appears in a four-page feature in South Africa's You magazine, occupying the front cover in a tight black dress and necklace, with the headline ' Wow, look at Caster now.' She told the magazine: ""I am who I am and I am proud of myself. I'd like to dress up more often and wear dresses but I never get the chance."" Posing in other outfits including black leather trousers and sequined top and a stylish dress, Semenya told the magazine that her mother always buys her clothes, adding ""now I know I look like this I'd like to do it more often."" The IAAF have confirmed that the results of the complex gender tests would be known in the next two weeks, but would only be released after consultation with Semenya. She has received overwhelming support in South Africa with president Jacob Zuma and other politicians joining the debate. But earlier this week, national track coach Wilfred Daniels resigned, claiming he should have told Semenya in July that she was to undergo tests to determine her sex. Semenya won gold in the fastest time of the year for women's 800m of one minute 55.45 seconds, finishing several meters clear of her rivals. It remains unclear if she will be stripped of her medal if the gender verification process casts doubt over her sexuality.","Caster Semenya takes part in glamour shoot in South Africa's You magazine .

"Mae Sot, Thailand (CNN) -- In a valley in the misty hills of Mae Sot sits Thailand's largest refugee camp -- a maze of mud alleyways stuffed with bamboo and wood huts. The camp is filled with people who fled Myanmar before the country's regime signaled its intent to come in from the diplomatic cold. For the majority of the 30,000 people living there, the camp is their entire world. Their daily routine changes little because they can't go into the rest of Thailand or they will be arrested, and they won't go back to Myanmar because they are still afraid or have nothing to go back to. But on this day there was something exciting happening inside the camp, something that has never happened before. Hundreds of people streamed onto a football field inside the camp to see a woman many consider a hero. They were waving the Burmese flag and chanting: ""Mae Suu, Mae Suu,"" which in English means Mother Suu. Suu Kyi cautions against 'reckless optimism' Mother Suu is how they refer to Aung San Suu Kyi -- a hero to many in the camp. Suu Kyi fought for democracy in Myanmar for decades, spending 15 years under house arrest because of it, before being elected to parliament -- though the military regime that has ruled Myanmar for decades still holds a great deal of power. She ended her first international trip since being released from house arrest by visiting the camp in western Thailand to see her people. ""Today we are very happy you know. Our people, we like to see our leader,"" one spectator said. Another chimed in: ""We need democracy, so we need our lady. She can do democracy. We trust her so much. We couldn't see her in Burma (Myanmar's former name) because she was always in her house. So we come here and now we see her."" Burmese migrants dream of return home . Bouquets of flowers were thrown at her while she waved from her car. She even grabbed a sign that someone had hand written in her honor. Unfortunately the pro-democracy leader wasn't able to make any rousing speeches because her actions in the camp were restricted by Thai Authorities. No megaphones were to be used, so even when she did try to speak to the cheering crowd while holding on to the open door of her SUV, she was drowned out by the sheer number of well-wishers. But not everyone in the camp decided to go. There were plenty of people going about their daily routine. For them Suu Kyi is a name they recognize but a person they know little about. ""I don't care because I am busy with my work,"" Ima said. Then she held up the thing that was on her mind: a small plastic bag of live frogs. That was the family lunch and she was on her way to prepare the feast at the same time Suu Kyi was due to arrive at the camp. Deeper into the bamboo maze, 34-year-old Mic is sitting outside his hut. He isn't going either. ""I only know her name but don't know who she is. I have never seen her, "" he said. He recalled his journey over the border at the age of nine. ""I couldn't live there. The Burmese attacked us. They were destroying things; they came and took our houses. We had to come here to live,"" he said. Mic couldn't escape misfortune for long. At 18, while gathering wood at the Myanmar-Thailand border, he stepped on a mine and lost a leg. But today daily life in the camp with his family, including his two children, is keeps him occupied. With Suu Kyi now a member of Parliament and Myanmar moving towards democracy, should the refugees start considering going back? Suu Kyi herself warned against expecting things to change quickly in her country. The refugees are doing just that. Not one said they would go back. Those who remember their homeland said it would be good to go home, but first they needed guarantees that they had something to go back to, plus they simply didn't trust the government -- not yet anyway. ""There is nothing left for me there,"" Mic said. And then there is a large section of the refugee community that has never known Myanmar. The camp is their home because they were born and raised there.","Aung San Suu Kyi rounds of historic Thai trip with visit to largest refugee camp in the country .

"(CNN) -- Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less. More than 40 percent of the average household food budget is spent on eating out, says Jeff Yeager. The author of ""The Ultimate Cheapskate's Road Map to True Riches"" has some ideas for saving $20,000 to $30,000 a year. The savings don't necessarily require sacrifices, he says, but rather choices that can lead to greater happiness. Yeager talked with Heidi Collins on Tuesday on ""CNN Newsroom."" A transcript of their conversation follows. Heidi Collins: How did you become a cheapskate, if you will? Jeff Yeager: Well, you know, I'm about 50 years old. I grew up in the Midwest, and back then, spending money was really a last resort. We led sort of a simpler life, and I think, in a lot of ways, happier, Heidi. And that's really what I write about is, maybe there's a silver lining to this economic downturn. Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more. Collins: All right. As a fellow Midwesterner, I share your cheapskate thoughts already. Yeager: You are a sister of the cheaphood. I knew it, Heidi. Collins: Well, hey. I do wonder, though, as you've gone through this process, if you will, if you become the ultimate cheapskate, are you noticing now a lot more people kind of joining your club? Yeager: You know, they are. And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice. I talk about a life of choices and how, in many instances, less can be more.  Watch Jeff Yeager explain his savings suggestions Â» . You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less. I'm not saying that's unimportant. But maybe we're missing the real point. The secret to the time is being content with less. Collins: OK. Wow. I like the way you talk. All right, so let's get to these five things, because that's what everybody really wants to hear about. Specifically, what they can do. And again, this is in order to save 20,000 to $30,000 a year. Really? Yeager: If these things apply to your family. Collins: OK. Yeager: And they are -- let me say in advance -- these are some fairly radical changes. But, again, it's probably not about sacrifice. It's about changing your life and maybe in the end being happier. Collins: OK. Well, very good. First thing you say, give up your cell phone. Yeager: Give up the cellulite life. I will use myself as a poster child. You know, I have a fairly successful career, a very happy life. I've never owned a cell phone, and nothing awful has ever happened. Collins: Now, wait a minute. I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business. Yeager: We can debate all that, but 10 or 15 years ago, none of us had it, and nothing awful happened. It seemed to me we were really quite happy. Average cell phone plan costs about $100 a month. There's an interesting article in the recent Christian Science Monitor that shows the actual cost of using a cell phone could be more than $3 a minute by time you factor in unused minutes and so on. Collins: Wow. All right. You say you might not need that second car and certainly not the third? Yeager: Americans own about 2Â½ cars per family. Can you give up one? The Auto Club says it costs about, on average, $1 a mile to drive a car by the time you factor in the cost of the car, depreciation and so on. So, you could easily be talking about $5,000 to $10,000 savings by sharing the remaining car that you have, using public transportation and so on. Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home. Quit going out for meals no matter what, if it's just a salad or a fancy fancy dinner? Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home. You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table. Collins: Yes, there would be people who would argue with you about that, though, too, because our culture is just so socially oriented to food. Every dinner, every business meeting, every lunch. Yeager: We're too busy to cook because we're too busy earning the money to spend it by dining out. Collins: Yes, yes. All right, you also say quit shopping for new clothes. Yeager: Yes. Here again, it's what's good for your pocketbook and good for the environment. Less than 2 percent of clothes that we throw away in America are worn out. The average family spends about $1,800 on clothing. Certainly most of us have more than enough stuff in our closet that we could go six months, even a year without buying new clothes. Collins: Yes, and then maybe just get it tailored or updated or something. Accessorize, I don't know, right? Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out. That's a waste of the Earth's resources. Collins: All right. And finally, give up college room and board. You want the kids to live at home forever? Yeager: This is a big one, you know? Back in my day, if you have a child in school, consider having them live at home while they go to school. It's been a huge generational shift. Back in my days, lots of people, including myself, lived at home when we went to college. Therefore, we didn't take out any college student loans. Now, of course, most kids go away to school, take out student loans. When they graduate, what do they do? They move back home with mom and dad! Let's skip the money step!","Author Jeff Yeager says radical changes can lead to big savings .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday night, as the Curiosity rover descended through the Martian atmosphere and the HiRISE camera on the Reconnaissance Orbiter caught its parachute deploy, the mood in the NASA Control Room became increasingly electric. As the rover touched down on Mars, the nation seemed to catch the fever and excitement. You would have needed a heart of stone not to get at least a little sentimental in seeing the high-fives and emotional embraces of scientists on live television. But was the moment a blip? Or are Americans rekindling their romance with science after what seemed like a long and tepid stupor? Americans have always been taken with the adventure of the ""final frontier,"" but perhaps this is not enough to explain our intense interest this week in a technological marvel. Mars landing: It could be crazier . With the rover so far from the laboratories that hatched it, it took light itself 14 minutes to reach us back on Earth. During that time span, we could not communicate with Curiosity. What if something went wrong? The waiting seemed like a solar system's game of chess by mail. The destination only made it more gripping: Mars has been a lodestone for the imagination for at least a century. Percival Lowell's 1890s views of a Martian civilization frantically irrigating its dying world were at last debunked during the Mariner 4 flyby in 1964. But hopes of life on Mars continued. In literature, from Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles to Kim Stanley Robinson's Martian Trilogy, the Red Planet has become the American's Avalon. Earth loves Mars -- why we're crushing on the red planet . Maybe we saw something deeper in the successful landing of Curiosity. We experienced -- even if vicariously -- a group achieving unambiguous excellence. In a nation where a city like Detroit can nearly collapse, where consensus on important policy issues seems far off, where some of the ""best and brightest"" minds of finance have built fragile institutions, how is it possible that a large cast of scientists and engineers can pull off such a remarkable task? One of the widely reproduced photographs from the NASA Control Room showed a trio of scientists: the clean-cut, the mohawked and the Gandalf-haired Ã¢â¬â something unthinkable for the NASA of pocket protectors and ties of 50 years ago. Times have surely changed. The Space Age has come of age, and this century has a chance to see us living on Mars. This is also the era when we might finally understand some of the underlying principles of human society. Scientists have long sought to unlock the rules and regularities in the natural world. Likewise, social scientists have long believed in the existence of invisible forces that govern our social world. Aided by today's nearly limitless computer power, we can learn from the traces we leave behind on how we actually live and behave. We can see not only how traffic jams form and markets crash but how courtrooms are more or less just, how wars have changed and how they might end. While science cannot capture the exhilaration of a successful society, or the misery of a failed one, it can show us the properties that underlie them. As scientists, my colleagues and I are inspired every day to put theories of both nature and human kind to the test, in hopes of answering their whys and hows. Rover had 'exciting ride' So is science cool again? Those of us in the laboratories, universities and institutes could be forgiven for not knowing it was ever uncool. Topics may fall out of fashion, and some can become political battlegrounds. What the immense interest in Curiosity's landing shows, however, is that the curiosity that drives all scientific endeavors persists in the nation as a whole. Complete coverage of Mars . When a rover millions of miles away can light our hearts, it's hard to say whether we wanted to know more about Mars, or space colonies, or Earth, or ourselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon DeDeo.","The landing of NASA's rover Curiosity on Mars generated intense national interest .

"(CNN) -- Under the California sun in a place known as Muscle Beach, where bronzed bodybuilders pump their cannon-size biceps, an energetic brunette works her arms -- and the weight purrs its approval. Tara Brown practices yoga with Lucky Cat in Venice Beach, California. Tara Brown of Venice Beach, California, noticed that her white, spotted cat, Lucky Cat, would scurry between her feet whenever she pumped barbells. ""Every time I do exercises, stretching, yoga, she was all over me,"" Brown said. Rather than pushing her away, Brown got inspired. Her mother often exercised with her cats and had given her a 1997 how-to book called ""Catflexing."" ""I like to use light weights anyway for the bicep curls and twists, so I use my cat,"" Brown said. ""Lucky Cat seems to want to hang out with me when I'm exercising, so I'll use her."" Neither she nor Lucky Cat has weight issues, but Brown discovered that exercising together can be a bonding activity. In an age where man and animal have gotten obese, people are finding ways to battle the bulge alongside their cats and dogs. The problem of pudgy pets has spawned fitness programs such as doggie gyms and water therapy classes. And if doga (yoga with dogs) weren't enough, exercise videos are being made to get plump pets and their owners in shape together. Celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson, who has trained actresses Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz, has workout videos for man and beast. ""I think that people take on a pet, and over time, they can't [put] as much time into it,"" Peterson said. ""What used to be the diligent two to three walks a day becomes one walk a day, plus some extra treats. So you have lack of exercise and overfeeding. It's what happens with humans."" Sedentary humans have sedentary pets, he said. Dr. Robert Kushner, obesity expert and professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, agreed. ""Dogs adopt the eating and activity pattern of their owners,"" said Kushner, who co-wrote a fitness guide for dogs and humans. ""If an owner sits and watches TV with their feet up, they're obviously not walking their dog. If they're snacking all day long, they'll also feed the dogs those snacks."" Peterson, who keeps four dogs, said people overfeed their pets out of guilt. ""I see people try to make up lack of time and lack of connecting with the pet by giving them extra food or table scraps,"" he said. In his Petfit Challenge exercises, Peterson suggests playing tag with the dog, doing abdominal crunches while throwing a toy for the dog to fetch and tossing around a toy for the dog while doing squats. Playing with the dog has health benefits. In a 2006 study published in the journal Obesity, a group of overweight pet owners with obese dogs lost a greater percentage of their body weight over a year than a control group, which did not own dogs. The pet owners lost an average of 5.2 percent of their body weight and their dogs lost 15 percent. Unlike the control group, the pet owners reported that they enjoyed exercising because they bonded with their animals. They also learned to measure the amount of food for the dog instead of freely pouring the food into the bowl. They walked their dogs instead of letting them outside for quick bathroom breaks. The dogs became an exercise coach in a way, said Kushner, the lead author of the study. ""The dog would be crying and begging to go for a walk,"" he said. ""They stand by the door with a leash or start nudging up to you, so they prompted the exercise. Those were the attributes that made it more likely to have the owner get up and go exercise."" Exercise options for dogs are plenty -- playing fetch, going for walks, taking them to dog parks and obstacle courses. The Food and Drug Administration even approved the first dog obesity drug, Slentrol, in 2007. But what can owners do when their cats get chubby? Obesity in cats as a result of overeating and under-exercising is a real health danger, said Dr. Fred Scott, director of the Feline Health Center at Cornell University. ""It has a significant impact when you're dealing with 10- to 15-pound cat,"" Scott said. ""Just a couple of pounds is a significant amount of increase. It predisposes the cat to other things. Diabetes is a common problem in cats."" Just like humans, diabetic cats need daily insulin, which can be costly and time-consuming. Owners can exercise with their cats, too. Peterson suggests jumping in place or doing abdominal crunches while using a flashlight to beam a light that the cat will chase. He also suggested tying a toy around dumbbells, so when the owner pumps his or her biceps, the cat will try to catch the trinket. Brown gets Lucky Cat to exercise by using a laser pointer and Silly String. And Lucky Cat helps her exercise. While Brown sits in the lotus position om-ing her way to inner peace, Lucky Cat sits on her lap and intently watches birds flying nearby. When Brown does leg lunges, stomach crunches and abdominal twists, Lucky Cat comes along for the ride. Brown twists side to side to work her abs, with added weight -- her cat perched on her shoulders. Lucky Cat emits an occasional meow and flicks her tail. Their weekly exercises are chronicled on Brown's blog. ""You're using the cat as a weight, so you can do biceps, abs and they're getting attention,"" Brown said. ""Obviously if the cat gets cranky, don't stress them out or anything. They'll let you know if they're ticked off. That's when you need to stop."" Even if the dogs and cats don't help the owner become fit, their furry companionship has therapeutic benefits for people. Pets have been shown to have a calming effect and soothe people with depression and loneliness.","California woman uses cat instead of barbells for exercises .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Thank the Olympic Gods for Tom Slingsby. Before this week, few Australians would have known of him. But this week, he has catapulted himself to national sainthood, winning Australia's second gold medal, this one in sailing. Australia has been in distress since the London Olympics began, watching a parlous performance in the pool where it usually performs exceedingly well. But there has been no Beijing haul of gold for the country's swimmers in London; just one gold in the women's 4 x 100 freestyle relay event, and nothing for the individual swims. iReport: What's your Olympic story? As a result, this sporting nation has been thrown into an identity crisis of sorts, played out in public as a tussle over what it means to be Australian. There are those who argue a poor gold medal tally is an appalling reflection of Australia's sporting prowess and an even worse for its self-esteem, playing out as it has on the international stage. Worse still, at number 19 in the gold medals table, it lags painfully behind Great Britain whose sporting achievements Australia likes to think it has and can always trump. And, for many Australians, the distinct possibility that New Zealand might walk away from this Olympic Games with more medals would be too much to bear. Read more: Pendleton tops golden night for Team GB . And there's the more sober view that sees getting to the Olympics at all -- let alone winning lots of silver -- as an achievement. In this camp, being gracious losers is as important as being great winners. And that Australia's great hope, James Magnussen missed gold in the 100 meters freestyle by 1/100th of a second is to be worn as a badge of honor: we were that good. So furious has the public flogging of Australia's performance been, that long jumper Mitchell Watt who walked away with a silver medal for his efforts, gave the media a blast. ""I think people need to start understanding that it is not easy to win an Olympic gold medal and there is absolutely nothing wrong with a silver medal,"" said Watt. The problem, as Watt sees it, is that the media views silver and bronze as disappointing results. ""The team is happy, the coach is happy. I got thousands of messages [from] back home that they are happy. The only people that are not happy are you guys. So you need to wake up,"" he admonished. Still the critics are not silenced. As Slingsby won gold for the Laser class single-handed dinghies sailing event and Australia looked guaranteed to win another gold on the water, the headlines have been kinder but carry barely disguised missives of shame. Read more: Numbers behind 2012 Olympics . ""Sailors come to Australia's Olympic rescue"" blared SBS online. ""Between them the sailors could spare the blushes of an Australian contingent that has been performing solidly without being able to convert seconds and thirds into Olympic titles."" And there was this from Yahoo!7Sport: ""Pearson defends Australia's medal haul,"" in which hurdler Sally Pearson echoed Mitchell Watt's frustration with local disappointment. Across the Tasman, there was the anticipated barb: ""Australia back to its old self with gold"". The near empty satchel of gold has inspired a review of Australia's swimming performance. Ordered by Swimming Australia, at its head will be former national head coach Bill Sweetenham and Olympian Suzie O'Neill. The aim will be to come up with a formula to prevent another national humiliation at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in two years time. But more than this, the aim will be to find out what went wrong in London. Was it team disunity? Or too much pre-event tweeting? Maybe the work ethic of the current crop isn't what it should be? Are the best of Australia's swimming coaches being lured by big dollars to train Chinese nationals? And a seemingly ridiculous question: should bearded swimmers be compelled to shave? Could it have been Magnusson's beard that ended his run for gold? It is all open to investigation, though Suzie O'Neill says there'll be no witch-hunt. In a nation accustomed to winning in sport, expectations are invariably high. Rarely is the concomitant pressure on competitors taken into account. As U.S. Open winner Sam Stosur has found, the weight of great expectation on your shoulders, is a viscerally grueling pressure. Bundled out in the first round at the 2012 Australian Open, before an audience expecting her to win after her New York triumph, took its toll. ""For sure it affects you physically, that's probably the easiest sign for the outside people to see,"" she told a media conference after her loss. ""I think it is easy to see that you tighten up, your shoulders do get tight, you don't hit through the ball."" Young James Magnusson, head buried in hands as he digested his loss, put it this way: ""You come to the realization that I would've preferred a different colored medal but the funny thing is that all I wanted to do after the race was see my parents. ''You start to get a realization of what is important. Everything's come so easy for me early in my career and I've taken it for granted,"" he said. The President of the Australian Olympic Committee John Coates believes the problem is not one of high expectations. That comes with the turf in elite sports. For Coates, the London problem might be eradicated in the future by reintroducing compulsory school sports. Though he warned last November that not enough money was flowing to the state-administered sports institutes to ensure the expected 45 medal haul in London, Coates doesn't think funding is an issue in Australian swimming. ""I think there is enough money in the system, they're just not necessarily spending it wisely,"" he told local media. The highest ranked Australian on the International Olympic Committee Kevin Gosper begs to differ. Money, he says, is the difference between gold and silver. The post mortem will be painful. If anyone is hoping it will be long as well, it is the Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who's parlous political position and poor polling has been off the front pages as the nation licks the wounds of a dented ego.","Australia is currently 19th on the gold medal table with just two golds .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Rachel Gold and Anthony Barberio don't have much in common. Rachel Gold  has applied for more than 650 jobs online but has had fewer than a dozen interviews. Gold is 28 years old and worked in recruiting after graduating from college. Barberio is 46 and never went to college but made his way on Wall Street for 20 years. Despite their differences, they have one thing in common: Both were laid off last year and still are looking for jobs. Gold was laid off in November from a recruiting firm. ""I definitely didn't think that I'd be sitting here nine months later without employment,"" she says. She has focused her job search on social networking Web sites, making contacts with recruiters that could someday lead to a job. Each week, she sets up meetings with potential future employers even though there may not be jobs open at the time. Gold also has applied for more than 650 jobs online but has had fewer than a dozen interviews from those inquiries. Barberio has spent most of his effort since his August 2008 layoff with online searches, applying for hundreds of jobs with little result. ""I send my rÃ©sumÃ©, and then you don't hear nothing back,"" he says. ""When you don't hear back from anybody, whether it's a yes or a no, or we received your rÃ©sumÃ©, you wonder where it goes.""  Watch Barberio and Gold describe their efforts to find work Â» . Barberio has enlisted the help of several employment agencies with the hopes they'll be able to find a job for him in a brokerage firm. But he worries that when his unemployment benefits run out, he'll have to take any job he can get. ""I'm gonna put a deadline as to when I'm going to have to seriously look for something,"" he says, ""whether it be a department store or something like that."" Until a job comes along, Gold has started a blog, KickedForward.com. It's based on the Kay Yow quote, ""When life kicks you, let it kick you forward."" She discusses free and inexpensive activities she's found to do in New York while she has some extra time. ""It's difficult, but I'm just trying to be as optimistic as possible that I'll find a position soon,"" Gold says. The national unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, and more than 6 million people are filing for unemployment benefits. Despite the grim job market, both Gold and Barberio are seeing reasons to hope. Gold says she's gotten a few more interviews recently. Barberio says he's seen more job openings in his industry, and he thinks one of them may be the perfect fit for him. ""I'm anxious to get back to work,"" he says. ""Almost a year in a house can drive anybody crazy.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Some people living in Atlanta have found a way to get goods and services without spending their hard-earned cash. Misty Love discusses YOUME options with A.J. Butler and Nick Viola. Once a week, this group that calls itself the YOUMEs gather around a campfire in Dr. David Epstein's backyard to offer what they have and to find out who within their community might have something they want. Each person takes a turn offering assets and announcing needs. Robin, an artist and interior designer, is looking for someone to refinish her hardwood floors. The next person up, Jo-Jo, a Pilates instructor who grew up on a boat, knows all about hardwood floors and can help Robin. A connection is made.  Watch them make their pitch Â» . Cameron, an acupuncturist, is looking for someone to fix his bike. A.J. Butler, a student, says he likes working on bikes and, although he has never seen an acupuncturist, will probably exchange time with Cameron -- another connection. The group is part of a growing national trend of communities looking for low-impact, locally rooted solutions in this challenging economy. Along with saving money, they're meeting neighbors, learning what they have to offer and making connections that they say will benefit themselves and their community, today and in the future. The YOUMEs are still working on guidelines, such as whether a premium should be placed on highly developed skills or arduous tasks. ""It's really about the two people who are making the arrangement, so if you have a really dirty job that takes six hours, maybe the other person would offer 10 hours of gardening,"" Epstein said. There are hundreds of barter networks set up across the country. Many use barter credits as currency, so a plumber who needs to have a cavity filled doesn't need to search for a dentist's office with plumbing problems to make a deal. He can fix a leaky pipe for one member of a network and use the credits he earned for that job at any other. Michael Krane, president of Green Apple Barter Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says his company has brokered everything from breast implants to college tuition to a horse. Web sites that put Americans in touch with like-minded people who are willing to trade everything under the sun have also seen a boost in traffic. SwapThing, which lists almost 3.5 million ""things"" available for trade, reports that its customers are bartering for different reasons than before. Although there is an online element to YOUME group, what sets it apart from other barter groups is the personal connection made at the weekly meetings. ""There's a scarcity of money and jobs, but we still have ourselves, our skills and our relationships. And we know that if we offer those, we'll get something back,"" Epstein said. ""Yes, this sort of thing is also happening on the Internet, but when it's supported by a personal connection, it makes for a more valuable process."" Jeanne St. Romain agreed. ""I like the personal aspect. I'm on my computer all day. You can't connect in the same way online."" Butler sees the meetings as an alternative to social networking sites. ""Facebook is fine, but a lot of the people I'm in contact with on Facebook are very similar to me in terms of age or stage in life. Jeanne and I would never meet on Facebook,"" Butler said, ""but here we are, talking about bike repair and marketing."" This life-enriching aspect is key, according to Epstein. ""We're hoarding our money and protecting it for utilities and mortgages and those types of expenses, but in doing so, we're depriving ourselves. Here, we're able to save our money for those things that require money and enrich our lives in the process."" Although life enrichment is a benefit for many, Misty Love, who's unemployed, needs help with more basic needs. ""I can do manual labor, video editing, massage. I'm looking for food. I would like a place to live, rides around town, basic necessities,"" she said. For group founder David Frane, the process is about finding a sustainable way of life without having to sacrifice too much. ""We all know how to be sustainable; we give up everything. But it's not a very palatable way to go through life. I don't want to live like a monk and not enjoy the things we enjoyed growing up."" But he also believes that it strengthens the community. ""In the normal process of purchasing things, we really lose track of the money once it's out of our hands. What we're trying to do here is spend our resources in ways that benefit our community,"" Frane said.","Making no-cash deals with neighbors can help in down economy .

"(CNN) -- As he strained, crunched and lifted weights, the muscle panels surfaced from Jason Dinant's stomach. Faintly at first, they emerged: one, two, three and four -- not yet a six-pack. ""In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing,"" said Jason Dinant. ""My bottom two abs haven't come in yet,"" he said. Since January, Dinant, an iReporter, has tried to get  six-pack abs in time for his 10-year high school reunion in June. Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada, resident, is one of the three iReport contributors being followed by CNNhealth as they strive to meet diet and fitness goals they set at the beginning of the year. iReport.com: See the journey to change . Dinant wanted to whip his beanpole figure into muscular shape. He also wanted to display a healthier physique for his blog called ""Naked Boy News,"" where he stands shirtless to give what he calls ""the naked truth about today's news."" And now the 27-year-old has another motivation. Dinant will be a guest, riding in a chariot-style car for an ""ab-veil"" on June 28 for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March in New York.  His car is to be accompanied by rows of shirtless men who also have six-packs. Dinant was invited because,  the Naked Boy News is ""a very popular act,"" said Maurice Michaane, director of the event. ""People in the Northeast know him."" With the parade only two months away, Dinant said: ""Now I'm in high drive. There's no cheating on the diet."" To get in shape, he works out four to five days a week, performing a combination of core exercises, dumbbell curls and pull-ups. He jogs, does cardio exercises and works with a fitness trainer.  To avoid looking like ""a toothpick with abs,"" he started lifting weights. With a stringent diet and hours at the gym, the 6-foot-tall Dinant shrank from 160 to 143 pounds. Losing weight is normal with all the exercising and dieting, said Robert Dothard, a personal trainer based in Atlanta, Georgia. ""You can't see a six-pack through fat,"" Dinant said. ""Belly fat is the enemy. People reveal their ab muscles, but the nutrition and exercise are also formula for weight loss."" The key is to eat in increments, but it's difficult for people with traditional, 9-to-5 jobs to eat something every two hours to maintain their weight, he said. Body builders try to offset the weight loss by consuming protein powders and supplements, Dothard said. Dinant's weight loss was completely unintentional. He said eating 16 egg whites and 1Â¼ pounds of chicken breasts every day gets old after three straight months. ""It's hard to eat that much protein,"" Dinant said.  ""I started drinking this protein shake so I can get in all the calories and protein."" Compared with just four months ago, the ""man boobies"" and the extra layer of flab around his midsection have been lost, Dinant said. And there's an even bigger benefit. ""I'm awake more. I'm alert more and I have more energy,"" he said.  ""I just feel better. My whole body has become healthier and better."" While pleased with the results, Dinant worried that with two-thirds of a six-pack, his body will begin to plateau. ""Plateaus are really a mental thing,"" Dothard said.  ""When that happens, people start going back to their own habits. So they end up cheating and binging."" If the body doesn't respond to the workout anymore, more difficult exercises should be adopted. ""Jason has to do something different or harder to maintain results to keep on the track that he's on,"" Dothard said. ""It can be frustrating, especially when he is still working out and the body is not responding to the same thing. People work out 30-45 days and get tremendous results, then it slows down or stops. Nothing's wrong. The body is adjusting to what you're doing.""","Jason Dinant, an iReporter, has met two-thirds of his goal for six-pack abs .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Ernie Casillas lived the good life as he doled out millions of dollars in loans in California. The former banker drove fancy cars and took extravagant vacations. Ernie Casillas says that being unemployed has grounded him from his high-flying days in the banking sector. But with the banking industry in crisis, his job is gone -- as is his lavish lifestyle. Desperate for work, he recently swallowed his pride and posted a message on Craigslist: ""Unemployed I need a job."" ""It took a lot for me to put that ad on Craigslist, because I had to change what I was before,"" he said, breaking down in tears. ""I wasn't this rich little yuppie anymore, driving expensive cars, having expensive suits. I'm in this just like everybody else looking for work. It humbles you. This is real."" Casillas, 46, is like tens of thousands of out-of-work Americans turning to Craigslist, the online classified ad Web site where people can post information for free. The site says it has 50 million users, most of them in the United States. More than 2 million new jobs are posted each month, according to Craigslist.  See a snapshot of facts, attitudes and analysis on the recession Â» . Many have begun posting messages of desperation seeking work. Some post their rÃ©sumÃ© and phone number; others swap goods online. iReport: Tell us how you're getting by . Casillas said it was a humbling experience to finally post his message on the site. Once responsible for bringing in $400,000 in cash per month for a credit union, he has been out of work for the past four months and now lives with his mother in suburban Los Angeles. He had tried newspaper ads and other online job sites, with no great success. Then one night, he posted a simple message on Craigslist.  Watch as jobless search for work, food, clothes on the Internet Â» . ""I have over 20 years of experience in sales, telephone sales in a call center, customer service, administrative assistant, cash handling, teller, and many more skills and abilities. Great personality, very friendly, hard worker, very responsible,"" it said. ""I will be happy to e-mail you my resume. I need a job now. Please call my cell phone.""  Watch a humbled banker describe ""this is real"" Â» . Casillas said he teared up when he first began typing the message -- that his life had come unraveled so hard and so fast. But ultimately, he said, he decided, ""I'm just going to put it out there. I'm not going to be embarrassed. I'm just going to tell the whole world: I'm unemployed, and I need a job today. And the response was great."" ""My phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing with people interested in my ability to think outside the box,"" he said, adding that he now has three good leads on potential jobs.  Need a job? See job fairs in your region Â» . The whole experience has given him a dose of humility. He is a self-described former yuppie going through turbulent times. When he sees homeless people these days, he wants to help them. The son of a Mexican immigrant, Casillas says, he was successful, making about $70,000 a year in the banking industry. Adding to his hard times, he and his wife have recently separated. How good were things just a few years ago? ""I was just living a very good life,"" he said. ""My daughter would ask me to take her to Las Vegas for her birthday, and we would stay at the most expensive hotels. Every year, this is what she wanted."" His daughter is now 11. He takes her to the mall every now and then. They don't buy anything on the trips, he says. He tells her, maybe next time. He says that living with his 75-year-old mother has helped ground him again. ""She has brought me down to Earth, being very humble."" Across town, in the coastal community of Redondo Beach, Craigslist and the down economy have brought together two strangers. Jill Gardner has been unemployed after being laid off from her job at a refinery in June. She's now trying to get into the hospitality field, but with her cash running low, she couldn't afford new clothes for job interviews. So she posted a message for clothes. ""I just decided to swallow my pride and try it and see what happens,"" she said. ""It's not easy, because I've never had to ask for things like that before, and it's hard not to provide for myself."" She said some creepy men called saying they would buy her clothes for ""favors."" However, two women responded with genuine help. One of those was Bonny Sue Robbins, a paralegal who brought Gardner an array of business suits, cocktail dresses and summer clothes. ""I felt that I owed it to another sister to help her on her way. I also was struck by the positiveness of her request. It wasn't just 'give me, give me.' It was 'help me help myself,' and I thought that was worth rewarding,"" Robbins said shortly after handing over the goods. Robbins said that a few years back, she went through a tough divorce. ""I was lucky that there were people there when I needed it, and I feel it's kind of my chance to pay back."" Both women hugged before parting. ""You're an angel,"" Gardner said. Robbins responded, ""We'll keep in touch so that I can go out and celebrate when you get your new job."" ""Definitely. And I'll buy!"" Gardner said. Back at her home, Gardner tried on one of her new business suits. ""I'm very grateful,"" she said. ""I'm just going to go forward with my plan and get a job.""

"(CNN) -- Agatha Achindu's life-changing career move started out simply enough -- she wanted a healthy baby. Cameroon native Agatha Achindu started Yummy Spoonfuls to give her child healthy choices. More than three years later, that passion is a profession for the native of Cameroon. She runs an organic baby food company, which is winning raves from some consumers and, even in a tough economy, has started to earn her a steady income. ""I had a very hard time getting pregnant, and so when I got pregnant, I said I was just going to do everything right, which means the freshest foods for my child,"" said Achindu, 42, who lives and works in Marietta, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. But when she reached for baby food off the grocery-store shelves, she said, she didn't like what she found -- jars filled with sugar, additives and preservatives. It was a far cry from what she grew up with in her African home. ""It's more farm to table, so we don't really deal with a lot of preservatives,"" she said. ""I could be eating plantains and know precisely where the plantains came from -- it was my backyard or a neighbor's."" She started shopping for vegetables and fruits from her local farmers' market. She cooked, chopped and blended to make baby food for her son, Jared. Her neighbors, friends and fellow church members started asking her to increase the sizes of the batches -- they wanted their children to have what her son was having. ""It's like, 'Can you make it for me? I can't do what you do. My child doesn't like when I make it and you're not there,' "" she said, mimicking the requests. Finally, in 2006, it got out of hand. ""My husband ... even though he never said it, was like, 'OK, it's about time you make some money doing this,' "" she said. Today, three years after incorporating Yummy Spoonfuls, she's still doing most of the shopping, chopping and cooking on her own. Achindu works out of a rented commercial kitchen in Marietta. Six employees, some of them African immigrants like herself, help with preparation and finances. Her flavors run the gamut from simple -- organic potatoes, carrots and peas -- to adventurous -- such as organic adzuki beans and sweet potato porridge. But it wasn't a move without sacrifice. Achindu, who had come to the United States in the early '90s, gave up a job as a manager for a hospitality software company and cashed in her 401(k) retirement fund to get the venture off the ground. ""That was money -- a lot of money,"" she said. ""But this is more fulfilling because I truly believe that I'm making a difference in people's lives."" Business experts have mixed feelings on whether a down economy is a good time to start a small business. There's the obvious concern about people spending less money and the difficulty in securing loans as the banking industry tries to claw its way out of meltdown mode. ""Right now the banks are failing left and right so it's difficult to get credit, "" said Small Business Administration spokeswoman Molly Brogan. And there are the numbers that exist even in good times -- 20 percent of new businesses fail after the first year, and more than half have failed four years later, according to the SBA. But there are positives, too. An economic crisis can be a good time for a new business to steal market share from established, but vulnerable, competitors, said Jeffrey Cornwall, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship at Belmont University in Tennessee. And small businesses require fewer employees, have less overhead and are able to cut costs more easily than bigger rivals when the economy goes sour. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a good product. In January, the parenting magazine Cookie named Yummy Spoonfuls its ""clear favorite"" baby food after a taste test by a dozen moms. It celebrated the food's wholesome makeup -- no sugar, salt, additives, preservatives, pesticides or fillers -- and said it offers ""some of the most creative and texturally interesting flavors we've seen."" Making money hasn't been automatic for Achindu despite her growing success. Up until about a year ago, the company was still operating at a slight loss. But now ""we don't need to dig into personal savings to support the business -- the business supports itself,"" she said. Achindu said she's hoping the big profits will come soon. Until then, she said her belief in what she's doing is its own reward. ""I truly believe that good food, healthy food, is not a privilege, it's a right,"" she said. ""Every child deserves to eat healthy food."" CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Agatha Achindu's business grew out of making her own baby food .

"BUCKLIN, Kansas (CNN) -- Rob Sellard's young wheat field is a stark reminder that no matter how bad the economy, farmers are always at nature's mercy. Rob Sellard and his wife, Sylvia, farm 14,000 acres, or about 22 square miles, in Kansas. ""The fact is we don't have any moisture right now, and when we hit some warm days this wheat will deteriorate very rapidly,"" Sellard told CNN during a visit in March, pointing to places where the green wheat was starting to die from lack of rain. ""Without moisture this wheat is going to continue to die,"" he said. Add in the high costs of planting last fall -- the spike in oil prices drove up the price of petroleum-based fertilizers, fuel and chemicals -- and the chances of making a profit this year look bleak. ""Four or five years ago, we were buying $350 to $400 a ton fertilizer. This wheat crop here, when we fertilized last August or September, fertilizer was $1,100,"" Sellard says. ""Even if we had a decent crop, even if we cut it decently, this wheat crop will be in the red.""  Watch as Sellard examines the dry soil Â» . For generations, the Sellards have farmed near Bucklin, Kansas. Rob and his wife, Sylvia, now farm a whopping 14,000 acres -- nearly 22 square miles. Recent years have been good to the Sellards and other farmers. 2008 saw record wheat prices, and the Sellards also raise Black Angus cattle -- the ones that make those tasty steaks that corporate execs once spent so lavishly on. But cattle production, like the economy, is also suffering.  Learn more about what affects farm costs Â» . ""With the fears on Wall Street, people have stopped eating out so much,"" he says. ""Less beef is sold. Foreign countries, they are struggling too because of everything that has happened, so we don't have the exports."" Exports are slowly improving, and farmers such as the Sellards do have the option of hanging on to their prized cattle until prices improve. Likewise, they can sit on their wheat harvest and hope prices go up -- although they'll have to pay to store the grain. Grain prices are low compared with last season, when record prices helped some farmers make a good profit in Kansas and across the country. According to the Kansas State University agricultural extension office, Kansas wheat sold for an average of $10.50 a bushel at its peak in 2008 -- largely a result of changing supply and demand. From 1999 to 2006, the average price was $3.16 a bushel. As of this week, wheat was selling for $5.39 a bushel at a local grain elevator in Bucklin, in southwestern Kansas. Sellard says that despite last year's high prices, not everyone made lots of money. ""You can read all you want, the sensationalism of high prices a year ago,"" he says. ""I don't know of very many people around here who got $10 or $11 wheat. In most people's case, when the grain started going up they sold it at $5, $6 ."" By the time prices hit $11, few farmers had any wheat left to sell. Still, Kelly Estes -- president of BTI Inc. Bucklin Tractor & Implement, the local John Deere dealership -- has seen farmers with money to spend. ""I think that farmers for the most part up our way, there is no question that net income has increased the last two years significantly to what it was, due to the commodity prices going up to what they did,"" he says. Estes has sold out of 2009 model farm equipment, much of which sells for more than a quarter-million dollars. Business has been so good that Estes is looking to hire more employees -- and he says the agricultural sector might be one answer to unemployment. ""There is a real opportunity for even city kids that want to come out and work in rural North America,"" he says. ""They are laying people off in the cites that might have opportunities here."" Estes, however, says he does worry about the impact of the economic downturn on rural America as the effects of the recession start to hit home. ""You know it always starts on the East Coast and West Coast and it kind of comes in. By the time it gets here we are hoping that the tidal wave is [reduced to] a ripple effect."" He already has seen sales of used tractors slow. ""For us '09 looks good, '08 was fantastic; '10 is a more cautious year for us. There is no question. Just due to what Mother Nature is doing, due to what the economy is doing."" Kraig Lindsay says things also have slowed at the Offerle Cooperative Grain Elevator in Bucklin, which he manages. ""There is less consumption going on, so [the grain is] not going to be moving out of here,"" he says. Some farmers are waiting, holding onto their grain, hoping for prices to go back up. So how will farmers and those who rely on them survive? ""We are concerned,"" Sellard says. ""But we hope in the good years we've saved up enough equity that we can go the next year. ... [that] we haven't blown it all in one year.""","Rob Sellard and his wife, Sylvia, farm 14,000 acres in southwestern Kansas .

"(CNN) -- Not everyone wishes others well in fulfilling their New Year's resolutions. Giyen Kim has gone from 190 to 186 pounds in four weeks. A doctor says that's ""very reasonable."" On a video that Giyen Kim recently posted on iReport.com about her frustration with trying to lose weight, one user commented, ""Who cares how much you have lost you are still a fat a**. Stop eating and go to the gym."" In the past, Kim might have cried and turned to a pint of ice cream for comfort, she reflected. But this time, she hit the gym -- a reaction she views as a revelation. ""I think that when you are doing what you need to be doing, things like that don't matter,"" she said. See Kim talk about losing weight . Kim, 34, is one of many CNN readers who are using CNN's iReport.com to share frequent updates of progress on their New Year's resolutions. iReport.com: Share your journey to change . Kim started out at 190 pounds on January 1 with the intention of losing about a pound or two a week throughout the year. Lately she has been cooking more for herself and trying to stay away from foods that have refined carbohydrates. She also tries to eat one vegan meal every day, but still occasionally indulges in bacon, the namesake for her blog Bacon is My Enemy. She exercises six days a week, mostly cardio, but wants to work on strength training and resistance training. She would also like to take step classes. So far she's shed four pounds in four weeks, but the pace feels slow compared with her diet regimens in the past, she said. She found that those extreme diet plans were not realistic options in the long run for maintaining a comfortable weight. Still, Kim maintains a positive outlook on her situation. ""No matter if you get derailed, if you just pick yourself up again and get back on track, it makes a big difference,"" she said. ""If you're in a place of feeling good about yourself, regardless of how your self-image has been in the past, it propels you to go forward."" Dr. Melina Jampolis, a physician nutrition specialist from San Francisco, California, said losing a pound per week is very reasonable. At most, Kim could probably lose an additional half-pound to pound a week, ""but any more than that and she would probably be losing water weight and muscle,"" Jampolis said. Jampolis recommends that Kim keep a daily journal of what she eats, and review it to see where she might be able to cut 50 to 100 calories, and where there might be hidden calories in her diet. Kim should also make sure she is varying the intensity, duration, and type of workout, Jampolis said. ""As she loses weight and becomes more fit, she is burning fewer calories doing the same thing, so it is critical to change things up,"" Jampolis said. But generally Kim's current pace is great -- ""At that rate, she will be down another 20 pounds by summer!"" Jampolis said. As far as Kim's professional goals, she has secured an interim position at a non-profit organization, and continues to do video blogs for Momversation.com. The market for freelance writers is tough, particularly with many newspapers struggling, she said. Still, Kim is optimistic about following her dream to become a writer. ""I'm not optimistic about our economic future as a country, but as far as me and my journey to find happiness, and accomplish some of these goals that I've had -- weight loss and following my writing passion -- absolutely, I'm still really positive about it,"" she said.","iReporter Giyen Kim has been losing a pound per week since the start of 2009 .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Swinging high in the air, a newly cleaned portable toilet is hoisted by crane to the nosebleed section of Orlando's new Events Center. The Sharps say they live by the motto, ""The money that's made in the company ... stays in the company."" The arena is the future home of the NBA's Orlando Magic. It will seat more than 18,000 fans when it opens next year. The only seats John Sharp Jr. is concerned about, though, are the ones in the 42 portable toilets he placed on this job site. When you work five stories high, a nearby toilet can be your best friend. But for Sharp's company, Comfort House, business isn't exactly, um, flowing like it did before the recession. ""We had 98 percent of our inventory out, with strong healthy prices,"" he told CNN. ""With the boom in the production homes, that's what kept us busy."" The arena is one of the biggest projects in Florida with more than 400 construction workers on site. But the decline in construction, which was 95 percent of Comfort House's business, hit the company hard. It's been forced to lay off about a third of its staff, including some long-time employees. Hours have been cut back as well. Now a sea of toilets sits unrented on the company's property. But it's not a sign of desperation, Sharp said. ""We didn't take on a large amount of debt. We paid cash for our assets,"" he said. The company owns its property outright, including all its portable toilets, vehicles and equipment. That's part of the business model Sharp said his parents taught him, and it's helped this family business survive and ward off bottom feeders who see the toilets sitting unused and think he's desperate to be bought out at a fraction of the cost. ""Had we spent outside our means, had we grown and leveraged everything, financed everything, we'd be in a really tough situation,"" he said. ""Good business model: Storing money, saving money when you make money ... keeping things simple.""  Watch Sharp discuss the recession's effect on his business Â» . Comfort House is a third-generation family business that started in the late 1960s. John Sharp Sr., the family patriarch, said he's acquired considerable wisdom from the three previous recessions that he and his company have survived. ""My boat is a 12-foot johnboat we use for duck hunting, and that's my yacht, and that's pretty much the extent of my extravagance,"" he told CNN. ""So we kind of live by that motto that the money that's made in the company kinda stays in the company,"" he said. But every company has its breaking point, and even with sound business principles and mechanics, the Sharps say, it's hard to tell how long they can last. This recession is by far the worst that the elder Sharp has seen. ""You don't know when it's gonna end,"" he explained. ""If you could tell me it's gonna end in six months, I could say, 'OK, here's my business plan,' but our business plan is that this could go on for another year or two,"" he said. In many ways his son is getting a real-world crash course in ""Recession 101."" ""It's been a great learning lesson for me ... I'm very fortunate ... because this will carry me, hopefully, for the next 30 years plus,"" he said. And while the Sharps are involved in a business that smells like anything but roses, John Sharp Jr. says as long as his toilets stay rented, they all smell like money. CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.","Portable toilet business hit hard by recession, decline in construction .

"(CNN) -- Between GPS devices on your car's dashboard and digital maps of almost any locale in the world on your smartphone or laptop, it's hard to get lost these days. Each orange Tele Atlas mapping van has six cameras, two side-sweeping lasers and a GPS on its roof. We may take these 21st-century services for granted. But someone still needs to do the actual legwork of mapping these places and making sure the information is accurate. Meet the people at Tele Atlas, the company that provides so-called ""base maps"" to such high-profile clients as Google, MapQuest and RIM, the maker of the BlackBerry. Tele Atlas also provides digital-mapping services for its corporate owner, the portable-navigation company TomTom. You can't say the company isn't ambitious. ""Our ultimate goal would be to map the entire world,"" says Pat McDevitt, vice president of engineering at Tele Atlas, which is based in the Netherlands and has its U.S. headquarters in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Base maps are the raw data -- highways, streets, stop lights and exit signs -- that navigation companies use as a starting point before adding their own applications. Most of the industrialized world has been base-mapped already. But Tele Atlas is constantly updating pre-existing maps to include new roads, traffic signals and buildings. Tele Atlas gets this information by combining satellite imagery, local, state and federal maps and most importantly, putting the rubber to the road in its Mobile Mapping Vans.  See how it works Â» . Pimp my ride . Six cameras, two side-sweeping lasers and a GPS sit atop each bright orange Mobile Mapping Van, making them, as McDevitt says, ""look a little bit like something out of 'Ghostbusters.' "" The cameras point in all directions, capturing a 360-degree view of everything the van encounters. And the GPS lets Tele Atlas know -- within a meter --everywhere the van has been. A computer screen sits next to the driver's seat so the driver can monitor images captured by the cameras above. ""The driver is really responsible for making sure the images coming from the camera are actually of high enough quality to be used on our production floor,"" says Kamron Barron, technical process manager at Tele Atlas. That means when a bug splatters on a camera's lens, the driver gets out to clean it off. This happens a lot. And if you think the vans must poke along, causing traffic jams on the roads they're mapping, you'd be wrong. The vans drive at normal speeds while snapping about three images per second. That's more than 100 million images per year, per van. When you consider Tele Atlas has dozens of vans worldwide, you begin to get a sense of the scope of the company's work. ""We have about 200 countries for which we have good navigable street maps, and that's expanding on a monthly basis,"" says McDevitt. Tele Atlas is constantly discovering parts of the world that have never been digitally mapped, he says. Instead of bench seats and fidgeting kids, Mobile Mapping Vans hold a metal cabinet with two hard drives. After about two weeks of crisscrossing everything from major highways to small country roads, the hard drives get full. One gets sent to awaiting Tele Atlas cartographers and analysts; the other stays with the driver as a backup. At Tele Atlas headquarters in New Hampshire, analysts pore over the data for updates and inconsistencies: changes in roads, speed limits and even how many lanes are on a highway. Once confirmed, the changes make their way into Tele Atlas software and eventually to cell phones, navigation systems and home computers. Base maps are updated every few months. Mapping goes 3-D . Images collected by the vans' cameras don't make it to the public because Tele Atlas doesn't have an application like Google Street View. But it soon may have something that's arguably even better. That brings us to the vans' side-sweeping lasers. As the vans drive, their lasers constantly scan the road and everything around it, recording information that Tele Atlas calls the ""first reflective surface."" This includes the width, height and contours of every building the van passes. This data, when combined with the images captured by the cameras, will help Tele Atlas create a 3-D world. Three-dimensional digital maps already are common in Japan and Western Europe. But 3-D maps are still in their primitive stages in the U.S., where their quality depends on the type of device they're displayed on. Cell phones might show gray amorphous blocks representing buildings. A laptop might show more detailed buildings with doors and windows. Within 18 months, Tele Atlas hopes to develop a powerful navigation system whose images will look almost identical to the surroundings through which we travel. ""It's a virtual reality experience for that customer,"" says McDevitt. ""As they go around, the buildings match, the roads match, the entire navigation experience matches what they would find in the real world."" In other words, we soon may have even less of an excuse for getting lost.","CNN goes behind-the-scenes at Tele Atlas, which does digital mapping .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Lt. Col. Greg Gadson is not a bionic man, but he does have a new set of powerful knees. Iraq war veteran Lt. Col. Greg Gadson shows off his new knees at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Gadson, an Iraq War veteran, was wounded in 2007 by a roadside bomb and lost both legs above the knees. This week, he became the first person to receive the latest version of battery-powered prosthetic knees. Gadson demonstrated his new knees during a news conference Thursday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. It's ""as if you were driving a school bus and then someone put you in a sports car -- you still know how to drive. There's quite a different feeling,"" he said. The Power Knee uses sensors (in contact with the thigh muscle, for example) to anticipate how the user will move, and then shifts itself into position. ""This is the second generation Power Knee,"" says Tabi King, a spokesperson for Ossur Americas, the manufacturer. ""It uses the same type of technology, but it's half the size, makes half the noise, is half the weight and is much more intelligent."" King says the knee is learning in real time to react to a patient so the patient doesn't have to think about walking. ""There are sensors and artificial intelligence in the prosthetic that are watching what the body is doing. The biggest benefit is by doing so much work on its own, the amputee doesn't have to think about movement."" Gadson, who had an older model of the powered knees, praised the latest ones. ""These knees are a lot lighter. They're quieter and they have significantly longer battery life,"" he said, adding that the batteries can last up to 16 hours. Gadson said he hopes his pioneering efforts will help others. ""If this proves to open a door for other people, that's a tremendous feeling, a tremendous reward. I'm not doing it for that, but I hope that this is a path for people to really expand their lives,"" he said. Michael Corcoran, a prosthetist who has been working with Gadson, said he thinks prosthetics of the future will be more powerful. The first Power Knee appeared in 2006. Corcoran expects the improved version to reach the general population in 2010. ""It wasn't designed for military use; it was designed as a knee for everybody,"" Corcoran said. ""We're fortunate enough here to be able to put this technology to its test here at Walter Reed, but as a broader application. You know, a year would be great to see these legs on vascular amputees, because it does improve mobility."" The goal is to come up with technology that adapts to all situations, according to Col. Paul F. Pasquina, one of Gadson's doctors. ""We try to challenge each one of our members into real-life situations where they have to use their prostheses not to just walk in straight directions, but to move in an environment that would be simulations of his home -- going up and down stairs, up and down curbs -- so we try to challenge the technology as much as possible."" Gadson is getting used to the new knees and wears them a few hours daily for now. But he has long-term goals for his new limbs. ""My expectations are that I can do whatever it is I used to do, maybe a little bit different. I have some other considerations, and if I can do those things, then I think that's success.""","Iraq war veteran gets first set of battery-powered smart knees .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Beijing has clamped down on information once publicly available on listed and state-owned companies, hurting the effort of Western investors and companies to gauge whether to invest in -- or short-sell -- Chinese firms. First reported by the International Financial Law Review, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce now requires company permission before accessing records such as financial reports and shareholder information. Companies that sell credit reports -- which give companies a quick read on the background of the firm they are considering doing business with -- have been hindered, said Peter Humphrey, managing director of ChinaWhys, an international business risk advisory firm in Beijing. ""They are restricted now. They cannot include personal identity information about individual shareholders or financial data from the last three years,"" he said. ""There is a major impact as many companies consume thousands of these reports every year, and that kind of information is no longer there, and it is not possible to get a reliable credit rating on this or that business partner without knowing how it's performing financially and who owns it."" Many believe the move may be in part a backlash against hedge funds like Muddy Waters Research, which prominently took down Chinese timber company Sino-Forest. The hedge fund has led similar short-selling crusade against other North American-listed Chinese firms such as including Focus Media, Rino International, China MediaExpress and Duoyuan Global Water, as CNNMoney reported. All were delisted after Muddy Waters' withering reports, with the exception of Focus Media. But the information clampdown also comes at a sensitive time for Chinese leadership as it readies for its once-a-decade transfer of leadership at the top as President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, who are both in their final year of office. Also in the backdrop is the public rise and fall of Bo Xilai, a rising star who was dismissed as Communist Party chief of Chongqing, the biggest metropolis in China. His right-hand man and former top cop Wang Lijun spectacularly sought refuge in an American consulate apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information on his old boss. His wife, Gu Kailai, is also being investigated on suspicion of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a ""conflict over economic interests,"" according to state media. Subsequent reports suggest Bo's family was worth millions of dollars through business dealings and powerful political connections. Difficulties getting access to information on companies ""began at the beginning of this year, and it became a lot worse after the Bo Xilai scandal,"" said Humphrey, who is founding president of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners in Mainland China. ""The people offering due diligence services to multi-nationals considering relationships with Chinese companies are finding certain information to complete the picture is now missing when they are assessing a company for investment purposes,"" he said. ""This is a handicap to people investing in China right now. It is linked to the political atmosphere of this year's leadership transition period, which has made China more tense, and the gathering of legitimate business information more sensitive."" The move to limit public information on companies comes after the April arrest of 1,700 suspects in a widespread crackdown on the illegal selling of personal information, the Shanghai Daily reported, including an official in Baoding who sold large amounts registered company information. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., which provides commercial information on businesses for credit checks, suspended its Shanghai-based market research company, Shanghai Roadway D&B Services Co., earlier this year after allegations after a Chinese report it illegally collected information on 150 million people, the Wall Street Journal reported.","China now requires company permission before accessing detailed records .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- The owner of Luscious Garage is wondering whether the electric wall outlet will be the ""gas tank"" of the future. A Toyota Prius hybrid, owned  by Luscious Garage, has been converted to run on electricity. Drivers of gas-sipping hybrid vehicles are increasingly interested in converting their vehicles from gasoline powered to electric, according to garage owner and lead technician Carolyn Coquillette. While drivers of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles complain about higher fuel prices, clients of the San Francisco garage are investing big bucks to make their green cars even greener. That's being done through plug-in conversions and adding more powerful batteries to currently available gasoline/electric hybrid cars, such as the Toyota Prius. ""The regular Prius is a gasoline dependent car; it doesn't get energy from anywhere but the gas tank,"" said Coquillette. ""What this [conversion] allows me to do is get energy through an [electric wall] outlet, so [the wall outlet] is like my electric gas tank,"" she said. Coquillette, who has degrees in physics and English, said she gets three or four calls or e-mails a day, asking about the conversion. And, she says, with gas prices at more than $4 per gallon, she expects even more interest. A lot of the cars that pull in to Luscious Garage are Toyota Prius hybrids, which Coquillette calls, ""the Volkswagen Beetle of our times."" Coquillette showed off the garage's psychedelically painted Prius, which has undergone the conversion. Its original nickel-metal-hydride battery packs have been replaced with lead acid batteries to extend the distance the car can travel on electricity. Coquillette expects to begin conversions to even more efficient lithium batteries soon. The plug-in conversion costs about $7,500. ""Gas becomes optional,"" with this conversion, Coquillette said. ""Gas isn't required to move this car anymore. If you want to drive a really long way, without recharging, yes, gas is required, but it gives you the flexibility of not having to burn gas anymore if you don't want to. And that's very liberating,"" she said. The garage itself strives to be green, with much of its power coming from solar panels. And with gasoline approaching $5 per gallon in the San Francisco Bay area, ""plugging in cars make a whole lot of sense right at the pocketbook,"" said Korthof, who works for Energy Efficiency Solar. What kind of people are converting to this conversion? ""We've seen such a diverse group of people,"" said Coquillette. ""We have some people who come in who are entrepreneurs, who are business people, there are some people who are diehard environmentalists, but there are some people who come in, they just want to burn less gas."" The corporate folks at Toyota don't have any official position on plug-in conversions. They don't endorse or discourage it. iReport.com: Show us your first car . But for hybrid owners who demonstrate exuberant efforts to find more energy efficiency, ""we really appreciate the fact that the Prius is the vehicle of choice,"" said Jana Hartline, environmental communications manager for Toyota. Hartline said the Prius was not designed with any conversion possibilities in mind, but she said the company welcomes any technology that pushes the envelope on plug-in batteries. While the nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery will remain the choice for Prius, Camry and Highlander hybrids, Toyota is doing some research and development with lithium ion batteries. Hartline said Toyota will be using lithium ion batteries in some commercial fleets in late 2009, mostly to learn more about charging behaviors. Although the current batteries are ""durable and reliable,"" Hartline said lithium ion batteries pack more energy into a smaller space. Much more research is needed, she said, about how hybrid owners would use their vehicles. For example, how often and for how long owners would plug in to the electrical grid, or a solar supply. Also, as more drivers become interested in alternative energy, they will need to learn more about infrastructure. For example: . â¢ Will companies, malls or fast-food joints provide charging stations? â¢ Will they charge for the charge? â¢ In what other ways will the energy infrastructure have to change? While the 2004-2008 Prius is the most popular hybrid conversion, it is also possible on 2005-2008 Mercury Mariner and Ford Escape hybrids. And, as Coquillette says on the Luscious Garage Web site, ""Any car can become a plug-in hybrid, if you have enough money."" And driven customers don't seem to be letting cost discourage them from the conversion. ""Customers are not coming to me and saying, 'I'll do this if there is a rebate.' People come to me and say, 'I want to do this right away,' "" said Coquillette. Luscious Garage will soon open a second location for the growing number of really green hybrid owners. ""Hybrid technology is one thing. Then there is plug-in hybrid technology, which is the next step, which genuinely removes your dependence on fossil fuel,"" said Coquillette. However, most U.S. electricity is created from burning fossil fuels -- about 70 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency of the Department of Energy. Just under 49 percent comes from coal-burning power plants, about 20 percent from natural gas and about 1Â½ percent from burning oil. CNN's Peter Dykstra and Miles O'Brien contributed to this report.","San Francisco garage converts hybrid vehicles to plug-in electric power .

"(CNN) -- At the end of a bitter political season too often hijacked by the extremes, the Rally to Restore Sanity was a heartening reaffirmation of American humor, smarts and civility. This year's previous political rallies on the Washington mall -- Glenn Beck's ""Restore Honor"" rally and the labor/liberal corollary ""One Nation"" rally emceed by Ed Schultz -- seemed like grim partisan marches compared to the optimism of this overflowing crowd composed of Americans from the sensible center. While Beck asked his supporters not to bring signs (presumably for fear of the distractions they might create) and Schultz's rally signs were mostly printed up by unions and activist groups, the signs at the Restore Sanity rally were clearly homemade. And like hosts Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, they used satire to comment on the political insanity that surrounds us. Among the signs I saw: . â¢ God Hates Nags . â¢ The Rant Is Too Damn High . â¢ Restrain the Craziness . â¢ Civil War was an Inside Job . â¢ Texans for Staying in the Union . â¢ Obama: At Least He Isn't James Buchanan . â¢ Hitler was Hitler . â¢ Want Less Government? Move to Somalia (not that there's anything wrong with that...) â¢ Real Patriots Can Handle a Difference of Opinion . â¢ Real Americans Don't Use the Term 'Real Americans' â¢ I read the Constitution for the Articles . â¢ I Masturbate and I Vote . â¢ Moderate to the Extreme . The content from the stage was essentially a comedy show mixed with musical guests. The message was communicated mostly in ""show don't tell"" sketches.  In one, Yusuf Islam, the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens, came out to play the hippie anthem ""Peace Train,"" interrupted by Ozzy Osbourne playing ""Crazy Train"" -- culminating with the O'Jays ""Love Train,"" a train we can all get on board. But the crowd was making a fairly consistent, if irreverent, political statement -- from the couple who drove up from Florida with a sign that quoted from a '70s pop song: ""Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right, here I am -- stuck in the middle with you,"" to a sign that read, ""What do we want? Moderation! When do we want it? In a reasonable timeframe!"" College students from Massachusetts made their point for the media: ""Can we get some airtime, please? -- The Moderates."" ""I think there's too much polarization going on -- and of course the squeaky wheel gets the grease,"" said Reba Winstead of Virginia, whose husband was laid off last year. She was holding a sign that read ""One of the Moderate Majority."" ""And so the extremists on both ends are the ones screaming the loudest and so the rest of us are in the middle thinking that we're not being heard."" Another woman held a sign that quoted legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow: ""We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason."" Some partisan journalists tried to spin the rally as just a liberal event, but they missed the point by reinforcing the idea that has helped get us into this mess: that if you're not with us, you're against us; that if you're not conservative, you're liberal. In fact, the only two signs I saw for actual candidates running this fall were for independents Lincoln Chafee and Charlie Crist. And while there was no shortage of anger expressed, at Fox News in particular, at what other rally would you see a sign that read: ""Palin and Pelosi: Both Nice Ladies."" More opinion on topics in the news . In comparing rallies, size matters -- and having covered the conservative and liberal rallies on the mall earlier this year, I can tell you that the Restore Sanity rally was much larger. This is fitting, because there are more Americans in the center than those who are on the right or left. And there are certainly more Americans who prefer the leavening effects of laughter to ideological fear-mongering. But for all the humor and affirmation, the Restore Sanity rally ultimately had a serious point that will apply when the election is over -- namely, that we have to work together to solve problems, but our polarized politics and the partisan media are stopping our ability to reason together as Americans. As Jon Stewart said in his instant classic of a closing speech: ""Why would you work with Marxists actively subverting our Constitution or racists and homophobes who see no one's humanity but their own? We hear every damn day about how fragile our country is -- on the brink of catastrophe -- torn by polarizing hate, and how it's a shame that we can't work together to get things done. But the truth is we do. We work together to get things done every damn day. The only place we don't is here [in Washington] or on cable TV."" So this celebration of sanity and humor came with a challenge to hyperpartisans in politics and media -- stop playing to the lowest common denominator, stop trying to divide Americans in an attempt to conquer. The American people are smart and ""most Americans don't live their lives solely as Democrats or Republicans or conservatives or liberals,"" as Stewart remarked. The rally's size and enthusiasm was evidence of a growing demand for something different -- an alternative to predictable talking points and the partisan spin cycle, a desire for humor and honesty, independence and integrity. It is both an opportunity and an obligation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John P. Avlon.","John Avlon: The ""Restore Sanity"" rally emphasized moderation and humor .

"(CNN) -- A teenage girl and her boyfriend were allegedly offered half a million dollars to keep quiet or flee the country to avoid testifying in an upcoming child sex abuse case against the girl's former therapist in Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, according to prosecutors. Four men were charged Thursday with bribery, coercion and trying to impede the prosecution of Nechemya Weberman, 53, who's pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing the girl since she was 12. Abraham Rubin, 48, was indicted on seven counts related to the alleged plot to undermine the case. If convicted, he could face up to seven years behind bars. Three other men, who are brothers, also tried to harass the alleged victim ahead of the trial, prosecutors said. If found guilty, Joseph and Hertzka Berger each could face up to a year in jail, while Jacob Berger faces a potential four years. ""Intimidation of victims and witnesses in sex abuse cases in the Orthodox community is what has made prosecuting these cases so difficult,"" said Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes. ""Victims were afraid to come forward because they would be threatened and shunned in their communities."" All four men were required to surrender their passports. Rubin's bail was set at $75,000, while bail for the three others were set at $5,000 each. Neither the defendants' attorneys nor Weberman's attorney could be immediately reached for comment. Prosecutors say the men pressured the girl and her boyfriend ""to not cooperate with law enforcement,"" and threatened to take away her boyfriend's rabbi-issued kosher certification from his Brooklyn restaurant. When they didn't cave, Jacob Berger allegedly ripped the certification down from the wall, prosecutors said, the latest in a string of alleged harassment against the girl, her boyfriend and their family.","A teenage girl and her boyfriend were allegedly offered half a million dollars to keep quiet .

"(Budget Travel) -- The following five sites have proven the most consistently useful for the editors of Budget Travel, who do thousands of searches a year. Budget Travel editors reveal favorite online resources to book flights, hotels and other needs. Dohop.com . Strictly for booking plane trips entirely outside of the U.S., such as a flight between Paris and Rome. The site runs simultaneous searches of multiple airports serving the same city -- five airports in London, for instance -- and it retrieves fares from no-frills independent carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair, which many better-known travel sites overlook. That said, be warned that Dohop doesn't work nearly as well for booking airfares leaving the U.S. Kayak.com . The all-time best site for finding the cheapest plane tickets in the U.S. Our biggest beef with Kayak's competitors is that when you click to book a fare, they typically direct you to a new page. Sometimes it's only then that you find out your actual departure time -- or worse, you're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again, only to discover far different results. Kayak stands apart. Once you've found a good flight on Kayak, click on the price and you'll be sent directly to the airline's Web site, where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears. Another perk: If you are flexible on your travel dates, we recommend you try Kayak's flexible-date search tool, which covers the broadest scope of routes and airports of any site we've tested. Budget Travel: Staying in touch while on the road . Priceline.com . The granddaddy discounter helps hotels, car-rental agencies, and airlines unload all sorts of inventory at well below published prices. We admit that Priceline's name-your-own-price option -- in which travelers don't know specific details until after their bids have been accepted -- isn't for everyone. But as flexible travelers, we're fans of using Priceline to bid blindly. You'll find the best results when bidding for upscale hotels in large cities, paying up to half off what other guests pay. The trade-off is that your hotel's location will be something of a surprise. But in many big cities, it doesn't really matter which neighborhood you're staying in, because you're hopping all over town sightseeing anyway. Of course, Priceline also sells travel the straightforward way (with the price and details quoted up-front), but, in our opinion, it's no better at doing that than Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz or CheapTickets. TripAdvisor.com . Harnessing the power of the masses, the user-hotel-review site TripAdvisor is the top way to hunt for hotels. We admit that the site's spectrum of good, bad and mixed reviews for the same property can be confusing. But you know what? After reading the reviews and disregarding ones that seem off or biased, you get a decent sense of what to expect in a hotel -- which is the point. For now, TripAdvisor is the top dog in user-generated hotel reviews, but we're also watching Kayak-owned TravelPost, a newly-launched site that offers a similar service (though to date it posts only about one-tenth as many reviews and opinions as TripAdvisor). Venere.com . Spotlights independently owned properties overseas, many of which never show up on American travel sites. Any booking site can point you to large, widely known hotels. But you might prefer to stay in a charming inn or a small property on your next trip, especially if you're traveling to Europe. Well, Venere is the go-to source for this type of mom-and-pop lodging, which usually provides better value for the money than hotel chains. A recent search on Venere for hotels in Nice, France, for example, turned up 20 spots charging nightly rates of less than 60 euros ($82). That's well below the typical rates for large hotels in the resort town. Venere also offers other kinds of alternative lodging, such as apartments, pensions and farmhouses.

"(CNN) -- Those of us who knew Alex Clowson understood that his baseball dreams were all behind him. We couldn't have been more wrong. Alex -- he insisted that we call him that; ""Mr. Clowson,"" he said, was too formal -- was the one man in our central Ohio town of 13,000 who had been a professional ballplayer. He had been captain of the baseball team at Ohio State, and had led the Big Ten in hitting in 1932 and 1933. The people who knew him back then thought he would have a shining career in the majors. And in fact, the Cleveland Indians organization signed him to a contract. But he injured his knee, and in the big leagues being just half a step slow means you're probably not going to make it. So from 1935 to 1941, he played in the low minor leagues, for Class C and Class D teams like the Zanesville, Ohio, Greys, and the Oswego, New York, Netherlands, and the Monessen, Pennsylvania, Indians. Which was all right with him. Baseball was the love of his life, and he was very good at it, and he was being paid, although not much, to play it. Then World War II arrived, and he was called to military service and his days on the diamond were over. Those of us who knew him in the 1950s and 1960s were friends of his children, with whom we were growing up. Alex and his wife, Betty, raised their young family, and Alex ran a succession of taverns and restaurants, some more successful than others. His love of baseball never died. He was an assistant coach at Ohio State for 10 years, and after that he seemed to be a volunteer coach for just about every league in town. ""Dad's been gone for more than 10 years,"" his daughter Wendy told me the other day. ""And I still run into people who tell me, 'Your dad was my Little League coach.' Or, 'Your father give me my first baseball glove.' "" If you were a kid in a summer league around town, you probably saw Alex Clowson in the stands. He was always so encouraging; his opinion meant more than anyone else's, because he was the man who had been a pro ballplayer. If you weren't especially good -- I can vouch for this -- it meant the world to you to hear Alex's voice shouting ""Nice throw,"" or ""Good hustle."" Why am I telling you this today? Because in the early 1950s, before any of us were old enough to know him, he ran a tavern called the Musical Bar. He was the owner and the bartender. One of his steady customers was a young Air Force second lieutenant assigned to nearby Lockbourne Air Force Base. The customer's name was George Steinbrenner. ""Daddy told me that Mr. Steinbrenner never ordered an alcoholic beverage,"" Wendy Clowson said. ""He would come in and order a Coke with a cherry in it. And he would sit there and he and my father would talk about baseball for hours on end."" This was many years before Steinbrenner, who died last week at the age of 80, bought the New York Yankees; George Steinbrenner with his Coca-Cola and Alex Clowson behind the bar were just two guys who loved to talk baseball. Clowson never struck it rich in business, but Steinbrenner, of course, did, and despite the difference in their worlds they remained friends over the years. ""Every time we would see Mr. Steinbrenner, he would say to us children, 'Your father taught me everything I know about baseball,' "" Wendy said. It may not have been literally true, but it was a lovely thing to tell the Clowson children, and they always were grateful for how Steinbrenner treated their dad. When Alex Clowson was dying in the summer of 1999, Wendy said, ""the thing that he hated the most was that he had macular degeneration, which meant that his eyesight had badly failed. He couldn't read the baseball box scores in the newspapers any more. That made him really sad."" Three weeks before he died in a nursing home, he received a telephone call from Steinbrenner. ""They talked for a very long time,"" Wendy said. ""We didn't hear the conversation, but we knew what it was about. Dad and Mr. Steinbrenner talked about baseball. Just like they always did."" Clowson died on a July Thursday in 1999. Before the funeral, Betty Clowson's telephone rang. It was Steinbrenner. He said he planned to do something to honor her husband. And so it was, on the day Clowson was buried in Ohio, that Steinbrenner issued an order to his staff at Yankee Stadium in New York. The Yankees weren't playing at home that day. But Steinbrenner ordered that the big American flag in center field be raised, and then lowered to half-staff. For Alex. Several weeks later, a package arrived at Betty Clowson's home. Inside it was the flag, along with a photo of it at half-staff overlooking the most famous baseball palace in the world. ""I know that Mr. Steinbrenner was a controversial guy, and that there were a lot of people who didn't like him,"" Wendy Clowson said. ""But I hope you can understand why our family loved him."" We who knew Alex Clowson thought his dreams of baseball glory had drifted away. But what did we know? In the end, against all odds and expectations, this impossible thing came true: . He made it all the way to Yankee Stadium. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Ex-minor league player had a major league friend in George Steinbrenner .

"(CNN) -- It's been three weeks since two little girls in Iowa went missing while riding their bicycles near a lake. On Sunday, two cars in the NASCAR Sprint Cup race will sport a special decal bearing the images of the cousins to raise awareness in the case. The beaming faces of Elizabeth Collins, 8, and Lyric Cook, 10, will be on the deck lid of cars No. 83 and 93 at the Pennsylvania 400 at Pocono Raceway. A telephone number for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children will also be on the decal of the two Toyotas, said BK Racing, which owns both cars. ""Being from Iowa, and having some other folks in the sport from Iowa, we're all pulling together to raise as much attention as possible to help locate the two missing girls,"" said Landon Cassil of Cedar Rapids and driver of No. 83 . ""I really want to do as much as possible and this is one step."" Travis Kvapil, who drives No. 93, is a father of three and hopes the team's efforts will aid in the search. ""As a parent, I want to do anything I can to help the families locate their children,"" he said. Lyric and Elizabeth were last seen by their grandmother on July 13. Authorities investigating their disappearance believe they are still alive. ""We believe these girls are alive and we are not discouraged by the passage of time since their disappearance,"" FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault told reporters in Evansdale, Iowa, last month. She declined to discuss exactly what evidence investigators might have that pushed them toward that conclusion. Breault said she believes someone knows something, and she urged anyone with information to step forward. Grandmother: 'We will fight' A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the successful recovery of the girls and the prosecution of the person, or people, responsible, she said. ""Cooperation with law enforcement is the key factor in discovering the whereabouts of Lyric and Elizabeth. Unfortunately, in this case law enforcement has not received total cooperation from all family and close friends. It's important to note that the majority of the family has cooperated 100%,"" Breault said. ""We believe there's someone out there and we would urge them to come forward.""

"(EW.com) -- AMC has canceled ""The Killing"" after two seasons, but the rainy murder mystery could live on at another network. A statement from the network read: ""After much deliberation, we've come to the difficult decision not to renew 'The Killing' for a third season. AMC is incredibly proud of the show and is fortunate to have worked with such a talented team on this project, from showrunner Veena Sud and our terrific partners at Fox Television Studios to the talented, dedicated crew and exceptional cast."" Fox Television Studios quickly sent out a statement saying the studio plans to shop the drama series to other networks: ""Fox Television Studios is extremely proud of 'The Killing,' the extraordinary writing staff and crew, and what we believe is one of the best casts on television. We will proceed to try to find another home for the show."" ""The Killing"" has been one of AMC's few missteps in an otherwise remarkable plunge into scripted television during the last several years. The show premiered last year to 2.7 million viewers and plenty of fan and critic excitement. But in a move that will likely be used as a real-time lesson in serialized series management for years to come, AMC and Sud managed to infuriate fans by declining to solve a mystery that viewers felt they had been led to believe would be cleared up by the end of the first season. When season 2 debuted in April, ratings dropped 33% to 1.8 million viewers. The audience continued to ebb until the finale, which garnered 1.4 million viewers and finally revealed who killed teen murder victim Rosie Larsen. With the ratings showing a clear downward trajectory, and having established across two seasons that the Larsen murder is the driving force of the show, cancellation seemed very likely. The lesson?

"(CNN) -- Maybe you had one as a kid, or knew someone who did. It's the iconic little red wagon with the Radio Flyer logo. Radio Flyer is developing a prototype of a wagon with digital controls and an MP3 player dock. If so, you might not recognize the newest product dreamed up by the brain trust at Radio Flyer's Chicago, Illinois, headquarters. This wagon, called the Cloud 9, is equipped with enough high-tech bells and whistles to make the family minivan jealous. ""We approached this product much like an automotive company might with a concept car,"" said Mark Johnson, Radio Flyer's product development manager. Outfitted with 5-point safety harnesses, padded seats, cup holders, foot brakes and fold-out storage containers, the sleek, curved Cloud 9 has every family covered for a ride through the park. But that's just for starters. There's a digital handle that tracks temperature, time, distance and speed -- just in case energetic parents want to track their split times around the playground. And there's a slot for an MP3 player, complete with speakers, for some cruising tunes. That's right: The little red wagon has gone 2.0. ""Music is such an important part of kids' and families' lives, we thought it would be great to have a speaker system built in the wagon,"" said Tom Schlegel, vice president of product development. The Cloud 9 is still a prototype, but it wasn't developed on a whim. The company did extensive market research beforehand, then tested it out on the real experts at home. ""We sit down [and] observe how moms and kids are using our products,"" said Schlegel. ""That's where our new ideas come from."" To develop those ideas, Radio Flyer's designers are using state-of-the art technology. They use Wacom Cintiq graphic tablets, allowing them to draw directly onto digital renderings of new products. And Radio Flyer also has its own in-house computer numerical control, or CNC, machines that create prototypes right on site. Radio Flyer's blend of cutting-edge design and old-fashioned products appears to be a successful recipe. In an economy where businesses and families alike are tightening their belts, the company is still going strong. ""Radio Flyer survived the Great Depression, and this year has been a difficult year for a lot of companies,"" Schlegel says, ""But Radio Flyer is actually growing this year. We're actually looking for engineers and designers in our product development group to keep up with the growth of the company."" That's quite a testament for a company nearly 90 years old. Theirs is an American success story that started when Italian immigrant Antonio Pasin started building wooden toy wagons in 1917. He had limited success but was encouraged enough to start the Liberty Coaster Company in 1923. The company changed names seven years later, becoming Radio Steel & Manufacturing. The world was introduced that same year to the first steel wagon, called the Radio Flyer. Since then, Radio Flyer has become perhaps the world's most famous maker of wagons, tricycles and other toys. The company's best-known product even inspired a 1992 movie, ""Radio Flyer,"" about a boy who imagines converting his red wagon into a flying machine to help his little brother flee an abusive stepdad. Whether you grew up on Rock-'em Sock-'em Robots or Xbox, the little red wagon has remained a mainstay of child's play. It's certainly evolved over the years, though -- the rusty metal has been replaced with plastic. But the spirit of Radio Flyer, which conjures memories of a simpler time, remains intact. ""One of the most important things about Radio Flyer products is that they really help [keep kids active outdoors],"" Schlegel said. ""So when we're designing our products, we're really looking at how can we get kids outside and playing, away from the video games and TV screens and computer screens."" CNN.com's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","Radio Flyer, maker of the classic red toy wagon, is creating a high-tech new product .

"(CNN) -- If you've seen a Victoria's Secret or Red Bull commercial recently, or watched the movie ""Chronicle,"" chances are, you've heard M83. It's the band whose dreamy, shoegaze-y, '80s-inspired music seems to be suddenly everywhere. ""It's hard for me to believe it's real,"" said Anthony Gonzales, the synth-pop mastermind behind M83. ""I've been doing this for a long time now, and this is the first time I feel like something is happening. ""It feels amazing, but it's also very scary, because I'm not used to that,"" he added. ""I'm not used to doing interviews and talking to that many people and feeling that important to people. It's very frightening, but I'm not going to complain."" Even though M83 has been around for more than a decade, their sixth and most recent album, ""Hurry Up, We're Dreaming,"" has just now put them on the front lines of success. The album debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on both the Billboard Current Electronic Album Chart and iTunes Electronic Chart. The first single, ""Midnight City,"" has gotten more than 11 million views on YouTube and has gone gold, with more than 500,000 downloads. The band has toured Europe and North America and has appeared on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" and ""Last Call with Carson Daly."" Gonzales was born in southern France and lived there for 29 years. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he started the musical adventure that became his latest album. ""I needed a change. I needed to put myself in danger always and try something different,"" Gonzales said of his move to the States. The band's sound is a difficult to describe. The first time fans listen to M83, a few descriptions may come to mind: ""ethereal,"" ""cinematic,""even ""galactic."" Fitting descriptions, as the band's name comes from a distant galaxy, Messier 83. ""I was obsessed and very fascinated by stars and astronomy when I was a kid,"" Gonzales said. Besides galactic entities, Gonzales is also inspired by his youth. In songs like ""Teen Angst"" and albums like ""Saturdays=Youth,"" M83 often incorporates ideas of childhood into its work. ""Remembering my teenage years and my childhood is a very positive feeling. It makes me happy. It helps me to go through my fears and my insecurities. So it's almost like a therapy,"" Gonzales said. Gonzales was born in 1980, so being inspired by his childhood also means he's enthralled by the music of the '80s. In fact, he believes that the decade was the single most important musical period of all time: ""In the '80s, it was like, so many good albums, so many good songs, and the way musicians were experimenting with new instruments, new technologies was truly amazing. I don't think my sound could ever go away from the '80s."" Experimenting is something M83 is very familiar with. On ""Hurry Up We're Dreaming,"" listerners hear brass sections, a children's choir, a collaboration with singer-songwriter Zola Jesus, towering synth melodies and even a child talking about frogs. ""I wanted it to be an ambitious album, something very produced, something I could remember until the end of my days,"" Gonzales said. And yet, with all that experimenting, the theme of the album goes back to Gonzales' childhood obsession: space. ""This album is about dreams but this album is also about what's out there and we're probably not the only species in the galaxy,"" Gonzales said. ""There's probably something else. I hope that one day I'll be the witness of a cool thing."" Throughout all the acclaim and spotlight this new album has brought on M83, Gonzales focused on his fans: ""I want them to be happy. I need them to be happy. ... If the crowd is happy and responds to the music, then it's a whole different game and becomes the most incredible experience of your life."" The group is planning a U.S. tour this fall.","M83's songs have been featured in commercials for Victoria's Secret, Red Bull .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- In a housing market plagued by one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country, finding and buying a home would seem to be an easy hunt, especially if you're armed with federal funding assistance. Lisa Locascio made nearly 30 bids before she was able to buy a home with help from a federal loan program. The sheer mass of real estate available at a record-low price combined with a no-interest loan from the government and an $8,000 income tax credit for first-time buyers quickly persuaded 30-year-old Lisa Locascio to make the leap into home ownership. It wasn't as easy as she thought it would be, even for someone determined to buy her first home. Locascio's Realtor and long-time friend, Lance Connolly, started compiling foreclosure listings more than three months ago, as soon as Locascio was approved for a $15,000 down-payment loan through the federally funded Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The loan program is aimed at helping would-be home buyers stabilize distressed neighborhoods while also helping banks unload foreclosures. The rules seem straightforward. The Phoenix program offers up to $15,000 in financial assistance toward a down payment or closing costs to approved applicants who are, in turn, required to provide $1,000 of their own funds toward the purchase of a foreclosed property at 1 percent below appraisal value. The loan has to be repaid when the home buyer sells or refinances. Nationwide, the program has allocated $6 billion to 250 cities and housing markets. Each city or market determines specific allocation amounts for locally run programs involving both home purchases and property rehabilitation. Phoenix received more than $39 million. However, after rolling out the home ownership assistance portion of the program six months ago, program funding has been used in the purchase of just three homes. Locascio is proud to be the third Phoenix home buyer funded by the program, but she cautions other program applicants, ""It's been rough. It's been a long process."" Locascio endured almost 30 rejected bids placed on homes throughout northwest Phoenix before a bank finally accepted a $140,000 offer on a 1,100 square-foot home. She admits to tears of frustration and said she almost considered giving up on the program in favor of moving in with family and saving toward a conventional loan. She eventually decided on optimism instead. Speculating in retrospect on why banks rejected so many of her offers, she said, ""I think it's because the program hasn't been out there enough."" Other cities are also having some slow starts or are trying a different tack with their funds. Los Angeles, California, which received $32.8 million in funding, has a program similar to Phoenix's. Four homes have been purchased thus far and two others are in escrow and pending. Miami, Florida, will roll out its home buyer assistance  program on Thursday. Chicago, Illinois -- which received $55.2 million, more program funds than any other U.S. city -- is using its money in a different way. Instead of an individual or family home buyer assistance program, it is focusing on loans to established organizations and nonprofit groups, which will then assist individual home buyers in buying lender-owned properties in the city. Mercedes Marquez, assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, told CNNMoney that the initial stage of the program has been difficult, in part, because the cities and communities involved in the program have never done this work before. ""It's a lot of work to implement,"" said Marquez, who feels the program is on track overall. CNNMoney.com: Read how the program is progressing around the country . Despite her many frustrations, Locascio is being touted as a success story by Phoenix's deputy housing director, Maria Bears. Bears, who compared some Phoenix neighborhoods to ""ghost towns,"" she said, ""It's a drop in the bucket , but if you're in a neighborhood and you see one or two homes that are purchased, you are encouraged with each one, and so I see this as a catalyst."" City officials acknowledge there is still a learning curve that must take place between them, the real estate owners (foreclosure owners are typically banks) and lenders. Potential home buyers must also complete an eight-hour class and participate in a one-on-one counseling session on the program to secure qualification. ""I think we're seeing momentum now. It was a little slow because we had to get a lot of people onboard,"" Bears said. Phoenix housing officials hope to help about 900 home buyers before the loan program ends in October 2010. City officials said the goal can be met, despite what critics and Bears herself are calling a ""slow start."" She said 10 qualified home sales are pending, and data provided by the city housing officials showed 72 area families have qualified for the program and are shopping. ""We're doing everything we can to get the word out,"" Bears said, including a telethon last week aimed at the city's Spanish-speaking residents. Critics of the program's slow progress also blame real estate investors for showing a renewed interest in Phoenix. Its beleaguered housing market was originally created, many argue, by those very same investors. Connolly, Locascio's Realtor, said he hears complaints from his clients who are constantly beaten to the deals by investors. ""From a buyer's standpoint, [program participants] can get outbid with a lower bid from a cash investor. Yeah, that's pretty frustrating,"" Connolly said. Bears confirmed the city's data reflects the same frustrations. ""Almost half of the resale homes that are happening right now are to investors, so we're finding that people who are participating in our program are having to make upwards of 20 offers ... to compete with investors,"" Bears said. She said cash investors ""have the ability to pick the best of the properties and then sometimes buy packets of properties ... sight unseen."" Locascio is enjoying a backyard view from her new patio. She proudly described her new abode as ""small ... cute. It's all me."" She said she still believes in the program and encourages participants to be diligent with constant bids and, above all, have patience. ""It's a give and take, really, but you're more giving than taking, unfortunately,"" she said. ""Hopefully, the next person won't go through what I went through.""","Lisa Locascio took three months, nearly 30 bids to buy home .

"(CNN) -- Up to 30 million people are facing ""a humanitarian disaster"" as one of Africa's biggest lakes shrinks, a United Nations agency warned Thursday. Porters remove goods from a boat on Lake Chad in 2007. Lake Chad was about the size of Maryland -- bigger than Israel or Kuwait -- in 1963, satellite images show. By 2001, it covered less than one-fifth of that area -- making it smaller than Delaware or Mauritius. The drying-up of the shallow lake is fueling conflict and migration, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said. Once one of the biggest bodies of water in the world, it could disappear entirely in about 20 years, the FAO said, citing forecasts from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ""If that happens it's going to be a disaster,"" Parviz Koohafkan, director of the Land and Water Division of the FAO, told CNN by phone from Rome. The Lake Chad basin is ""one of the most important agriculture heritage sites in the world -- the biodiversity, the migratory birds, not to mention more than 20 million people living out of Lake Chad -- fisherpeople, farmers."" ""It would be a human disaster, a tragedy,"" he said. ""In this case we have people who are the poorest of the poor."" ""In addition to an approximately 60 percent decline in fish production, there has been degradation of pasturelands, leading to a shortage of animal feed estimated at 45 percent in certain places in 2006, reduction in livestock and biodiversity,"" the agency said. The disappearance of the lake is being caused by climate change, population pressure and natural variations in climate, the FAO said. Two rivers which feed the lake, the Chari and Logone, have been significantly reduced in the past 40 years, the agency said. The organization will unveil the results of a study into the diversion of the Oubangui river in an effort to help Lake Chad at a conference, ""Saving Lake Chad,"" in Rome, Italy, on Friday. ""Water transfer is not a new thing,"" Koohafkan told CNN. ""The major problem is that this is water transfer among different countries. ""These options cost money, and need policy work, need technical work,"" he said. ""Some kind of public-private partnership would be needed"" to pay for any solution as ambitious as diverting a river. The lake borders on Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, one of Africa's most populous countries. It measured about 25,000 square kilometers (9,652 square miles) in 1963 and 1,500 square kilometers (579 square miles) in 2001 -- just under 17 percent its size 38 years earlier. Lake Chad is only one of many inland bodies of water which are drying up. Similar warnings have been issued about lakes in Mexico, Russia and elsewhere.","Lake Chad could dry up in 20 years, U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization says .

"(CNN) -- A pregnant leukemia patient, whose life was at risk because anti-abortion laws in the Dominican Republic prevented doctors from treating her, has started receiving chemotherapy, officials said Thursday. The 16-year-old started chemotherapy treatment in the country's capital late Tuesday night, hospital officials said. The patient, whose identity has not been released because she's a minor and because of the hospital's privacy policy, is 10 weeks pregnant. Doctors were hesitant to give her chemotherapy because such treatment could terminate the pregnancy -- a violation of the Dominican Constitution, which bans abortion. Dr. Antonio Cabrera, legal representative for the Medical Center for Teachers (known by its Spanish acronym SEMMA) confirmed the news Thursday. ""The patient is receiving chemotherapy,"" Cabrera said. ""And the hospital is following the appropriate medical protocol in this case."" Doctors at SEMMA started evaluating the teen for chemotherapy last week, pending an official decision on whether they could proceed with the treatment. Turkish women rally against plans to restrict access to abortion . Representatives from the Dominican Ministry of Health, the Dominican Medical College, the hospital and the girl's family talked for several days about how to proceed. A decision was made early this week, Cabrera said. ""She's a very special patient,"" Cabrera said. ""She's a minor, she suffers from leukemia and is 10 weeks pregnant. All three factors were considered in making the decision to proceed with the chemotherapy treatment."" Dr. Amarilis Herrera, president of the Dominican Medical College, said that she and representatives from her institution met with doctors at the hospital on July 18 to evaluate the case and work together to find a solution. In a statement, Herrera said that ""bone marrow tests were sent for analysis to the United States (in order to find) the best therapeutic treatment."" Both the college and the Ministry of Health favored proceeding with the treatment. The case has sparked renewed debate over abortion in the Dominican Republic, with some lawmakers calling on officials to reconsider the abortion ban. Earlier this week, Rosa Hernandez, the girl's mother, said she had been trying to convince doctors and the Dominican government to make an exception so that her daughter's life could be saved. ""My daughter's life is first. I know that (abortion) is a sin and that it goes against the law ... but my daughter's health is first,"" Hernandez said. According to Article 37 of the Dominican Constitution, ""the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death."" Dominican courts have interpreted this as a strict mandate against abortion. Article 37, passed in 2009, also abolished the death penalty. Cabrera, the hospitalÃÂ¹s legal representative and also a doctor, said doctors will monitor the condition of the girl and the fetus constantly during the chemotherapy treatment. ""We're clinging to science and God,"" Cabrera said. Activists allege forced abortions, sterilizations in China .

"(CNN) -- It's not the kind of view you want from the window seat: a damaged wing flap with a handwritten note on it saying ""we know about this,"" with an arrow pointing to the area in question. That's what one passenger on a July 28 Alaska Airlines flight from Burbank, California, to Seattle saw, snapping a photo of the rather unorthodox note that generated criticism on social media. On Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said that a wing flap on the Boeing 737 had received an FAA-approved trim repair before the flight and was safe to fly. ""And before every flight, pilots do a walk around the plane, and they kept seeing the section repair and pointing it out and kept filing a report saying, 'you need to fix it,' "" said airline spokesman Paul McElroy. Maintenance workers wrote the note to head off further reports, which was ""not the best approach,"" McElroy said. ""It is not the best way to report an issue, and we have since removed the writing, and the flap will go in for a total repair in October."" The maintenance technician's intentions were good, said another representative, Bobbie Egan. ""But the communication was not appropriate and did not follow company procedures."" ""We apologize for any alarm it may have caused,"" Egan said in a statement. Egan said a passenger shared the photo with Alaska Airlines seeking an explanation for the note. The photo appeared on the popular website reddit.com and was shared and discussed on social media.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration Tuesday ordered a nationwide halt to ""opposite direction"" runway operations, in which planes arrive on runways in one direction and depart in the other, as the result of an investigation into last week's incident at Reagan National Airport involving three planes which came dangerously close. FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta ordered the temporary halt, saying the agency discovered it has ""no standard protocol"" for switching from a one-way runway traffic pattern to the less common two-way pattern. The lack of a standard protocol likely contributed to the July 31 mishap, he said. During last week's incident, a southbound US Airways regional jet arriving at Reagan came in close proximity to two northbound jets taking off from the airport. At their closest, two planes came within 0.82 nautical miles, less than the required 3.0 nautical miles. In a memo released Tuesday, Huerta repeated his initial statement that the aircraft were never on a head-to-head collision course. And he again blamed the mishap on a miscommunication between the Potomac TRACON, a regional radar facility, and managers at Reagan's control tower. But the investigation has altered one key understanding of the incident. Department of Transportation and FAA officials originally told reporters that the misunderstanding occurred as controllers ""flipped"" the direction of the airport, switching all traffic from a northbound direction to a southbound direction. Now Huerta says the regional TRACON controller intended to change the direction of only the arriving aircraft, allowing ""opposite direction"" traffic on the runway. Controllers sometimes allow two-way traffic to comply with noise restrictions or to accommodate cargo operations, he said. Takeoffs and landings are staggered to avoid collisions. While changing from one-way traffic to two-way traffic encompasses many of the same procedures as flipping an airport, ""there is no standard protocol in place,"" Huerta wrote. ""We believe this contributed to the miscommunication."" Huerta said he is halting two-way runway traffic ""out of an abundance of caution,"" and that the FAA expects to have standard procedures in place within a month. Huerta said the Reagan incident also raised the issue that the FAA's front-line managers are managing administrative tasks in addition to overseeing tower operations. ""We need to be sure that they are solely focused on the operations in the facility and not handling administrative duties"" during busy times, he wrote. The 2 p.m. incident involved three aircraft: Chautauqua Airlines 3072, Republic Airlines 3329 and Republic 3467. All three aircraft were operating as US Airways Express. All reached their destinations safely.","Lack of protocols for switching runway traffic patterns led to temporary halt, FAA says .

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Two young children have emerged as heroes after warning others of a gunman on a rampage at their Sikh house of worship in suburban Milwaukee. Abhay Singh, 11, and his sister, Amanat, 9, were sitting outside the gurdwara Sunday morning when the shooter, identified as Wade Michael Page, first opened fire on two people. ""We ran as fast as we could inside to warn everybody in the kitchen and everybody else there is a man outside with a gun,"" Abhay -- whose name means ""fearless"" -- told CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday. ""We were a little bit scared."" The children said they hid with others in a pantry after sounding the alarm. Their mother, Kanwal Singh, and father had told them to stay inside while they went to a store to get supplies for a meal at the gurdwara. But the children said the inside was hot. The horrified parents could not immediately reach the children. Shooting victims put others first . ""We were worried and praying like hopefully we will see them again,"" KanwalSingh said. The FBI, meanwhile, said Wednesday that Page died from a self-inflicted wound to the head and not from a shot fired by a responding officer. Police previously said Page died after being shot by the officer. That shot in the stomach was potentially fatal, but Page died from the self-inflicted wound, said Teresa Carlson, special agent in charge for the FBI in Milwaukee. Carlson revealed few other details about the investigation of Sunday's shooting in Oak Creek. Six people were killed. She said that no clear motive has been established and that Misty Cook, Page's former girlfriend who was arrested Sunday on an unrelated weapons charge, is probably not linked to the shooting. ""We do not believe she had anything to do with it,"" Carlson said. After authorities went to Cook's home to interview her, she was charged with possessing a gun, which is illegal because she is a felon. Page, a 40-year-old Army veteran who neighbors say played in a so-called hate-rock band, was the lone gunman, Carlson said. Police have not found any notes or other clues as to why Page went on a killing spree at the Oak Creek temple, and his family members have not reported observing warning signs. ""This is a guy who moved around a lot,"" Carlson said. ""We are zeroing in on any possible motives, but right now, we don't have one."" Authorities have conducted more than 100 interviews nationwide with people including Page's family members, associates and neighbors, she said. They also are reviewing his e-mails and other electronic records. The investigation continued as a community reeled from the carnage. Explainer: Who are Sikhs? For a fourth consecutive night, mourners held vigils Wednesday to remember the dead and pray for the wounded. One gathering was held near the White House. Many of the estimated 200 or so people wore ribbons colored orange and blue to symbolize the identity of the Sikh community. Many wrote notes on a sign that had the names of the victims and read ""United Against Hate."" The sign will be sent to the Wisconsin temple. Authorities received tips that Page might have links to the white supremacist movement, but nothing has been confirmed, according to Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards and the FBI. Officials said that the 9 mm semiautomatic handgun with multiple ammunition magazines used by the attacker had been legally purchased. According to a man who described himself as Page's old Army buddy, the attacker talked about ""racial holy war"" when they served together in the 1990s. Christopher Robillard of Oregon, who said he lost contact with Page more than a decade ago, added that when Page would rant, ""it would be about mostly any non-white person."" Page, born on Veterans Day in 1971, joined the Army in 1992 and left the service in 1998, according to Army spokesman George Wright. The Sikh turban: At one personal and extremely personal . Page's service was marked by ""patterns of misconduct,"" and he received a general discharge because of ""discreditable incidents,"" according to a Pentagon official. Robillard said Page was pushed out for showing up to formation drunk. An Iowa-based trucking company, which employed Page from April 2006 to August 2010, said it fired him as a driver for violating company policy regarding impaired driving, which also applied to personal vehicles. Barr-Nunn Transportation, in a statement Monday, said Page was dismissed after he received an impaired-driving citation in North Carolina while driving a personal vehicle on his own time. ""Additional documentation indicates he refused to submit to a chemical analysis to determine alcohol concentration or presence of an impairing substance at the time of the citation,"" the company said. Page lived in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for several years. He owned a modest house on a country road, but he ran into financial trouble and the home was foreclosed on, according to Wells Fargo bank. John Tew, manager of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle store in Fayetteville, told CNN he fired Page from his parts coordinator job in 2004 because Page ""had a big problem with authority"" and with working with women. Tew said he found an application for the Ku Klux Klan on Page's desk the day he was dismissed. Two neighbors of Page identified him in photos that showed him playing in the far-right punk band ""End Apathy"" with Nazi flags hanging near him. The six victims of Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and one woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur.

"(CNN) -- A publicly funded school in Louisiana said Tuesday that it may rethink requiring students suspected of being pregnant to be tested medically and, if pregnant, to be home schooled. ""There have never been any complaints from students or parents about the school's policy,"" Delhi Charter School principal Chris Broussard said in a statement issued a day after the American Civil Liberties Union sent him a letter criticizing the policy. ""However, in light of the recent inquiry, the current policy has been forwarded to the law firm of Davenport, Files & Kelly in Monroe, Louisiana, to ensure that necessary revisions are made so that our school is in full compliance with the constitutional law."" Under the school's policy, which is posted on its website, ""The school reserves the right to require any female student to take a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not the suspected student is in fact pregnant."" In cases where a test determines that one of the school's approximately 700 students is pregnant, ""the student will not be permitted to attend classes on the campus of Delhi Charter School,"" it says. It adds that any student suspected of being pregnant who refuses to submit to a pregnancy test ""shall be treated as a pregnant student and will be offered home study opportunities. If home study opportunities are not acceptable, the student will be counseled to seek other educational opportunities."" Study: Teen access to Plan B uneven . In a letter sent Monday to school officials, ACLU Executive Director Marjorie R. Esman said the policy ""is based on the archaic and pernicious stereotype that a girl's pregnancy sets a 'bad example' for her peers -- i.e., that in having engaged in sexual activity, she has transgressed acceptable norms of feminine behavior."" The news that the policy would be reviewed was welcomed by Louise Melling, director of the ACLU Center for Liberty, who described the policy as ""reminiscent of the '50s."" Melling said any revisions should ensure no student is forced to take a pregnancy test and no pregnant student ordered out of the classroom. ""Girls who are pregnant today deserve the right to be in class just the same as women who are pregnant deserve the right to be in the workplace,"" Melling said. ""That's the law."" Tiseme Zegeye, a legal fellow at ACLU's Women's Rights Project, said the organization had not heard directly from the school. ""We are, of course, encouraged that they are saying that they will try to bring their policy into compliance and we hope they do this ... in time for the school year to start."" August 15 is the first day of classes. If that doesn't happen, she said, the school should suspend the policy until revisions are made. ""As it now stands, there are numerous constitutional violations as well as violating Title IX,"" she said, referring to the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools. ""If they don't suspend it immediately, we are considering taking further legal action."" No one from the school or from the law firm responded to CNN's requests for comment.

"(CNN) -- After three weekends, it's clear that Warner Brothers' $250 million franchise finale ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which has earned $363.3 million, won't be able to match ""The Dark Knight's"" box office haul ($533.3 million) domestically, but it's more than making up the difference overseas. ""Rises"" is running well ahead of ""The Dark Knight"" internationally, having grossed $378.4 million so far. At the same point in its run, ""The Dark Knight"" had earned $203.7 million on the way to a $468.6 million international finish. All told, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" has grossed $732 million worldwide, which rockets it into the number two spot at the worldwide box office this year behind ""The Avengers,"" which has grossed over $1.4 billion. In third place is ""Ice Age: Continental Drift,"" which has earned $716 million. It's very likely that ""Rises,"" which seems headed to a domestic finish just below $450 million, will slightly surpass its predecessor's $1.0 billion worldwide cume, though only time will tell how high it will actually rise.

"(CNN) -- The Olympic journey of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings ended where it all began: In the sand. Minutes after winning their third consecutive Olympic gold medal in women's beach volleyball on Wednesday, the American duo announced an end to what is considered one of the winningest partnerships of the Games. May-Treanor, 35, and Walsh Jennings, 33, made history by putting away fellow Americans April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in two sets, 21-16, 21-16, to extend their undefeated streak in three successive Games to 21-0. They lost only one of 43 sets. ""Beach volleyball is not going to be my career anymore,"" May-Traenor told reporters shortly after the match. ""It's time for me to be a wife. I want to be a mom. I want to share this time with my family. All of us athletes sacrifice more of the family than people maybe realize. It's getting back to that. My mind says it's time, my body says it's time. It's the right time. It's time for me now to help the next generation."" Walsh Jennings is looking toward a possible fourth Olympic appearance at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings partnership on the sand is the stuff of Olympic legend: A nearly 12 year partnership that helped elevate the sport to one of the hottest tickets at the Games. The two first teamed up in 2001 after less than satisfying performances at the 2000 Games in Sydney. May-Treanor finished 5th with then partner Holly McPeak in beach volleyball, while Walsh Jennings played on the women's indoor team. By the time the two hit Athens in 2004, they were already a force to be reckoned with having won international titles. But it was on the sand in Athens where they started their golden run -- and their shutout. By the time they hit Beijing in 2008, they were full-fledged celebrities with endorsements and television appearances. They took an extended break in 2009-2010, with Walsh Jennings giving birth twice and May-Treanor recovering from a torn Achilles tendon that she ruptured while preparing for a turn on ""Dancing with The Stars."" The break raised questions about whether the two would ever play together again. May-Traenor had decided not to play in 2011, while Walsh Jennings was preparing for a run at the London Games with a different partner. As the story goes, just before the start of the 2011 season, May-Traenor reached out to Walsh Jennings and said she was ready to play again. They met in California where Walsh Jennings asked the big question: ""Are you all in?"" May-Traenor told NBC recently. The answer: Yes. But there were things to work out, on the sand and off. The two admitted to reporters during the London Olympics to attending relationship counseling to improve their communication skills -- and their game. Heading into Games, they weren't the favorites after less than golden performances in international competition. They struggled a bit. Walsh Jennings was diagnosed with pinkeye, and their winning streak looked to be in jeopardy after they lost a set to Austrian sisters Stefanie and Doris Schwaiger. The duo roared back, though, looking like the team of old. By the time they made it to the gold medal round, a capacity crowd that included royalty and celebrities -- from Prince Harry to David Beckham -- turned out to watch what May-Traenor had said months earlier would likely be her last match. In two sets, played just over 38 minutes, May-Traenor and Walsh Jennings completed their Olympic journey. ""I wanted to do this for her and finish in this way for both of us,"" May-Treanor said. ""We've lived so much life together."" Walsh Jennings turned to her teammate and said: ""It's been 11 years of fun and crazy time. You are a dear, dear friend ... and I'm glad that you went out the way you deserved."" The two women held hands -- united in victory and accomplishment -- as the American flag was raised and the National Anthem was played in their honor. There, on a podium in the sand, they bid a golden farewell.

"(CNN) -- The ""Bourne"" franchise returns to theaters Friday minus its central character, Jason Bourne, but with a new hero and story -- a turn that caught even its writer/director, Tony Gilroy, by surprise. Gilroy's behind the prior three ""Bourne"" scripts, and a fourth film wasn't at all in his future plans, the Oscar-nominated director told CNN last week. As for returning for ""The Bourne Legacy,"" Gilroy said, ""It wasn't something I anticipated."" In fact, he was initially more akin to the fans who didn't see a need for another ""Bourne"" film in the first place. ""That's where I started,"" Gilroy said with a laugh. ""That's how I came in with that first conversation."" And yet, with all of that hesitancy, the new character he found in Aaron Cross ended up winning him over. Portrayed by Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner (who's already had a blockbuster summer as Hawkeye in ""The Avengers""), Cross is an agent with another government program called Outcome, which creates agents with medically enhanced cognitive and physical capabilities. Thanks to the actions of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne in the last ""Bourne"" film, 2007's ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" Aaron Cross finds himself in jeopardy as Bourne's exposure risk creates problems for Outcome. The timelines of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and ""The Bourne Legacy"" are parallel to one another, although you won't see Jason Bourne in this installment. Neither Damon nor ""Ultimatum"" director Paul Greengrass were interested in a round four, and ""after those guys left, the studio and the estate [of 'Bourne' series author Robert Ludlum] were very aggressively trying to figure out what they were going to do next,"" Gilroy said. ""I don't think I was the only person they were talking to."" They held a meeting, and Gilroy agreed to watch ""Ultimatum"" for the first time and see whether that sparked any ideas. Viewing Greengrass' ""Ultimatum"" made Gilroy ponder what could happen if there was a ""larger conspiracy ... and it turns out there's a whole other world outside."" With encouragement from his brother, Dan, who's also a screenwriter and shares credit with Gilroy on ""Legacy,"" Gilroy presented the idea to the studio -- still not expecting that he'd be the one to write the script. ""I came in and thought, hire me for two weeks and I'll play with that idea and we'll figure out who else at the end of it. And it got better than I thought, quickly, and even still it wasn't something that I was going to write, much less direct."" And then, the character of Aaron Cross ""came into focus,"" Gilroy said. ""I realized what a really sort of exciting piece of meat that was to throw on the grill there, and that's when I got more excited and then ... some time after that, I didn't want to let it go. I got into it, and when we made the deal to write the script, why don't we make a directing deal at the same time."" Gilroy's directed two projects before ""Legacy,"" including the well-received George Clooney vehicle ""Michael Clayton,"" but nothing on such a large scale, he said. ""The other films, and I mean this in a good way, they were very claustrophobic. They were very, very contained. Everybody was trapped,"" Gilroy said. ""We're sort of blowing out the walls here and saying there's a much bigger world that the audience needs to see. We expand in specific ways with the camera and how we shoot every day, but also [there's] much more design in this movie. We built a lot more, we travel around the world a lot more, we go a lot wider."" He's also employing a different story structure, having Cross' character converge on the paths of Edward Norton's retired Col. Eric Byer, ""the mastermind of the entire franchise,"" and then Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing, a research scientist involved with the Outcome program who teams up with Cross to survive. Rather than have her enter the plot through Aaron Cross, she's on her own journey, Gilroy said, noting how ""that in itself is a really much more open perspective."" Weisz, who told CNN that she's a ""huge fan of the original trilogy"" as well as writer/director Gilroy, said that what intrigued her about this installment is that ""it lifts the curtain on the first three and it shows you who was really in charge, who was really the puppeteer behind all the puppets. So if you think you knew what was happening in the first three, you actually didn't."" The hunt for the right actor to play the franchise's new agent was a long and publicly documented one, a process that was difficult because Gilroy knew he needed an actor with the skill to carry the theatrical components but who could also handle the physical rigor of the shoot. ""The part's really demanding, and Matt [Damon] had established a level of excellence,"" Gilroy said. ""We just needed a really, really great, up-and-down, everyday, can't believe what you're seeing kind of actor. And that person also had to be an athlete ... because of the way these films work, everything's so real. We're not a big green screen, fake-it kind of show."" To top it off, they also needed an actor unknown enough to not draw immediate past references in the minds of moviegoers, but not so new there wasn't any recognition at all. Examining all those needs, the guy left standing was Jeremy Renner. 10 sexy movie spies . ""Jeremy was just sort of like a ship that was just sitting there right on the horizon waiting to come in and unload,"" Gilroy said. For his part, Renner told CNN that while he didn't necessarily feel pressure to live up to Damon, he did hold himself to a personal standard of excellence when it came to performing the action work. ""All I had to really live up to in my mind was that physical part that Matt was doing in the previous films, and that level of authenticity and the ferocity of that action. You can't fake these things,"" Renner said. ""It would do a big disservice to this franchise to not be able to perform what was asked of me and what was required of me."" And as for the skeptics, Gilroy learned to stop worrying about them long ago. It's known that the ""Bourne"" franchise hasn't been ""the most streamlined 12, 13 years of a franchise; there's been all kinds of rambunctious production history and personality clashes and all the rest of the stuff that's there,"" Gilroy said. ""The one thing that sort of kept it going ... and I think this comes from Matt more than anything else, no one ever really did it for the money. "" The studio might have been driven by dollars, but ""everybody was always like, 'if it's not going to be right, we all have other things to do,' "" he went on. ""So it's like, if there's not a good reason to do it, no one's going to do it. That was true for the first three and that was certainly true for me in this."" CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.","Writer/director Tony Gilroy didn't expect to return to the 'Bourne' franchise .

"(CNN) -- The posts show how quickly life can change. ""Everyones dressing up as Batman, im going dressed as Bruce Wayne... Albeit a short stubby unsexy Bruce Wayne #CouldntFindBatmanMaskInTime,"" wrote one Twitter user, identified online as Zach Eastman. ""Going to see the final batman tonight! So EXCITED!!!"" wrote another Twitter user, @DjaylaRene. And, in hindsight, most chillingly: ""Of course we're seeing Dark Knight ... people should never argue with me."" Gunman kills 12 in Colorado theater shooting . Those posts surfaced before the shootings early Friday morning at a late-night showing in Aurora, Colorado, of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" in which 12 people were killed and dozens more were injured. All three people who were quoted above appear to have been in the theater complex when a heavily armed gunman opened fire on moviegoers, according to police. The third post appears to be from Jessica Ghawi, who was reported dead in the shooting. Ghawi was a former sports-news intern at a television station in San Antonio, according to that station, Fox 29. ""It's true, my former intern Jessica Ghawi was a victim in the shootings last night. She used @JessicaRedfield as her twitter handle,"" wrote a Twitter user identified as Mike Taylor. In the hours after the shooting, her friend mourned her death in real time. ""Devastated,"" wrote a sports radio host in Denver, identified online as Peter Burns. ""Lost a very close friend in the shooting last night. @JessicaRedfield came to Denver to pursue sports career. I'm shaking."" Aspiring sports reporter Ghawi feared dead in shooting . The horrifying posts highlight a shift in the way our society tells the story of a tragedy, and also how we react to it. Before Twitter, smartphones and YouTube, it would have been impossible for an event like Colorado's ""Batman Massacre"" to have played out for the global public in real time. The shooting is just the latest instance of social media being used to document a tragedy or a news event even as it is unfolding. A Pakistani man last year unwittingly live-tweeted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. And the war in Syria is being documented in large part by citizens and members of the opposition movement who risk their lives to post YouTube videos and photos of the violence. NRA tweeter was 'unaware' of Colorado shooting, spokesman says . But the social media posts about the Colorado shooting are a haunting reminder of the visceral power of first-person accounts of tragedy. And also a sign that society these days deals with grieving after an event like this in a much more public and immediate way than in years past. Reports of the 1999 Columbine school shooting, for example, which happened only 17 miles from Aurora, spread in a much different way. Thirteen years ago, witnesses talked to TV crews rather than uploading their stories instantly to the Internet with mobile phones. Shooting turns movie into surreal horror: 'This is real' Some reports from the Aurora movie theater appeared to come out as the shooting occurred. ""Now I'm thinking it was bullets coming through the wall from 9 causing smoke and fire cracker sounds. #aurorashooting #batman #shootng,"" a Twitter user identified as Jamie Marshall wrote. ""Never seen so many cop cars in my life. Its a parade of lights,"" wrote Isaac Ramos. ""Everything keeps replaying in my head. It was so unreal,"" @DjaylaRene wrote. ""I am getting ready to cry. So scared. I need a hug. I almost got shot 9 times. I had a chance to be like 50,"" wrote another Twitter user, @Abenistar. He later added: ""I seen a person bleeding out their mouth and gasping for their last breath. This ain't right. #Century16Shooting. Thunk the world is ending."" Shaky YouTube videos show people screaming, crying and rushing out of the theater after the shooting, some of them with bloody wounds. Another video, apparently taken outside the building by a person who was in the theater next to the shooting, offers a glimpse into the mindset of a person who has just witnessed tragedy. The amateur videographer sounds to be at a loss for words. ""Oh Jesus. July 20th, 2012. Aurora Century 16,"" he says, in a sort of real-time confessional about the event. ""There has been a massive shooting here. A lot of people wounded, a lot of people dead. I can't really take pictures, just because I'd rather (be) helping people than wanting to take pictures of some pretty ghastly (expletive). There's some guy in a gas mask apparently -- teargassed theater 9. We were in theater 8. Just lit it up. It hit a lot of people, a lot of younger people. Oh. It's pretty -- it's pretty bad."" Timeline of worst mass shootings in U.S. Officials also turned to the Internet in an effort to make sense of the events. The Red Cross is asking people who witnessed the shooting to tell loved ones that they were OK over social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. ""People don't know how close you were, so help alleviate that anxiety,"" spokeswoman Patricia Billinger told USA Today. And other officials used the Internet to offer sympathy. ""We certainly appreciate the nation's thoughts and prayers as our police department continues to investigate the terrible theater shooting tragedy that occurred today,"" the city of Aurora wrote on its Facebook page. ""Our condolences go out to the victims and their family members."" Are you there? Share your story with us on CNN iReport and post your tributes to the victims.

In a new interview with MTV News, Grace is asked about her father's response to the article and says, ""He tried calling, I tried calling him back, but then he wouldn't call me back.

I explained about gender dysphoria; I told him if he had any questions, there were books I could point him in the direction of reading. He wrote me back maybe a two or three sentence-long email that just said, 'There was something very lacking in your presentation. For now the door is open, but we'll see.' And that's it.""

"(CNN) -- Veronica Noone had been a little overweight since her teens, and, like many people, had spent the better part of her life trying different diets, whatever was popular at the time. Having a child changed that, she says. After she had her baby, she decided to lose the post-baby weight and the extra pounds she'd been carrying years before that. Dropping about 70 pounds in seven months, Noone's maintained a healthy weight for almost four years now. Name: Veronica Noone, 33, an online interactive designer at University of Maryland-Baltimore County who lives in Perry Hall, Maryland. Background: She was a very normal child but her weight struggles began after puberty. She was probably 10 to 20 pounds over the weight she thinks fits well on her 5-foot-9 frame. It struck her hard because in her group of friends, she was one of the chubby ones. She started to yo-yo diet to try to fit in. After college she gained more weight, topping 200 pounds. She became what she calls a ""serial dieter."" When  she and her husband decided they wanted to have a child, it was a decision that changed her outlook on life and her self image. How much she lost: On June 30, 2005, she weighed 206.8 pounds. She reached her goal weight of 149 on January 19, 2006. She eventually got to 135 pounds, but finds 145 to be a more comfortable weight. How she lost it: After her son was born in 2005, Noone started to eat in a different way. ""I found that when my focus changed from trying to get thin to trying to be healthy and a good example [for my son], all of a sudden the weight started coming off,"" she says. Her preoccupation with her body image disappeared and she became more concerned with what were the best food choices she could make for her son. But just as important, she came to another realization. ""I didn't have to be perfect,"" she says about her plan to lose weight. Before, she would hammer herself if she broke with the diet and had a doughnut or something else that made her feel like she had failed. ""Every choice I make is an on-plan choice. If I choose to eat a doughnut, that's fine. I'm going to eat that doughnut. It doesn't mean I'm off my diet. I'll account for that in a later meal. Or I'll have a lighter dinner."" How she's keeping it off: She's maintained her weight for about four years. She credits her Twitter account, where she enters what she eats like it's a food journal. ""It makes me stay conscious of what I am eating,"" she says. She did keep up with her Weight Watchers points for two years, but felt a little restricted by tracking them. She always cooks dinner for her family and the leftovers become lunch for the next day. She also says she likes to bring snacks to work like soup, yogurt, apples and pudding cups. iReport: Share your weight loss success story . Advice to others: If you just had a baby, don't put any pressure on yourself to lose the weight, Noone says. Instead, make a decision to eat healthier the moment you get home from the hospital. The goal should be to be conscious of what you eat and to not take the easy way out because you are frazzled or short on time. ""A lot of women don't think about themselves at that time; it's all about the new baby and it needs to be,"" she says. ""But if Mom's not feeling good and taking care of herself, then the child is not going to be happy either."" Noone believes the outside motivation of having a child made it easier for her to lose weight because she was also being healthful for her son. She also incorporated her son into her activities. One of the fun things she liked to do was to dance around the house with her child, getting down to everything from kid's music to rock 'n' roll to alternative music to hip-hop. ""The little guy,"" as she calls him, is going through a Linkin Park phase, she says. She also blogs on a Web site called greenlitebites.com where she shares recipes she and ""the little guy"" like to create.","Veronica Noone is an iReporter and weight loss success story .

"(CNN) -- During summer, Hollywood seems more fixated on the teen dollar than ever, but every once in a while, a movie comes along to prove that older audiences haven't been forgotten entirely. Often enough, that movie stars Meryl Streep, and here she is again with ""Hope Springs,"" a funny, outwardly modest comedy that manages to feel utterly novel by focusing on the sexual and emotional needs of an older woman. The promotional campaign pushes the raunch as if this were a Judd Apatow production. You can hardly blame the marketing guys for that (even if the TV spots do give away the movie's kicker), but it's a gross misrepresentation of an expertly written, sensitively handled movie with two wonderful actors grabbing the chance to show something honest about a relationship gone stale. Tommy Lee Jones is Arnold, a crusty accountant who spends his evenings falling asleep in front of his golf shows but doesn't see anything wrong with a marriage that has worked quite efficiently for 31 years. Streep's Kay is no feminist, and you wouldn't call her liberated either, but she can't stand the loneliness any longer. Her husband hasn't touched her in years, they sleep in separate rooms, and they don't talk really, much less kiss. Summoning all the reserves she has left, she insists on intensive couple therapy, a week in Maine with Dr. Feld (Steve Carell). Reluctantly but pragmatically, Arnold goes along, grouching and grizzling every step of the way. A good deal of the movie plays out on the couch, and Jones gets the lion's share of the laughs just by virtue of his orneriness and evident discomfort sharing intimacies with a stranger. Two strangers, really, because his wife doesn't have a clue about feelings he's barely admitted to himself. Jones has played his crankiness for comic effect often enough over the years, but director David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada"") keeps the actors rooted in naturalism, not caricature, and it's exciting to see Jones respond with a performance of discipline and subtlety. When he does turn that frown upside down, it's pure joy, and we finally appreciate what Kay must have seen in this selfish bully. If we're honest, Streep's also been known to overplay comedy, and yes, she does have to nibble on a banana in one of the movie's more predictable turns, but at heart this is a lovely portrait of repressed housewife and mother finding the courage to put everything on the line late in life. You find yourself gazing at her face for fleeting inflections of optimism, excitement and melancholy. Carell, you should know, plays his part absolutely straight; it's the definition of a supporting performance. The writing is sharp enough that the humor doesn't need to be forced. Even in these sexually candid times, there's still a residual squeamishness where sexagenarian sexuality is concerned. Screenwriter Vanessa Taylor is a producer on ""Game of Thrones."" In her first produced film script, she strikes a fine balance between comedy and pathos and between the separate but related estrangements that have crept up on husband and wife over the years. Can such things be cured in a week of counseling and carefully choreographed ""sexercises?"" The movie is romantic enough to have us believe it, in part by making it clear that love requires real effort -- and faith -- as well as wine and roses. Streep fans, I think you're going to enjoy this one. I know I did.","""Hope Springs"" is a rom-com featuring a mature couple, Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones .

"Evansdale, Iowa (CNN) -- Authorities stopped draining a lake here on Thursday as authorities awaited FBI divers and sonar probes to help find two young cousins missing for nearly a week. About half the water in 25-acre Meyers Lake had been pumped out by Thursday afternoon, three days after drainage operations began, city officials said. An FBI dive team was en route to Evansdale and would employ two types of sonar in the search, bureau spokeswoman Sandy Breault said. Lyric Cook, 10, and her 8-year-old cousin Elizabeth Collins were last seen by their grandmother on Friday when they left on a bike ride. The girls' bicycles and a purse were found near Meyers Lake hours after they were reported missing. Scent dogs following the girls' trail led searchers around the lake and stopped at the water's edge, Lyric's mother, Misty Cook-Morrissey, said. Meanwhile, authorities have searched the home of Cook-Morrissey and Wylma Cook, who is a grandmother to both girls, with the women's consent, they told CNN. The two women said they also provided investigators with a key to get into the attic. Investigators confiscated Cook-Morrisey's computers with her consent, Cook-Morrisey told CNN. Also, Daniel Morrisey, Lyric's father, told CNN that he walked out of a police polygraph session this week because investigators accused him of hurting the girls and knowing where they are. Officials began draining the lake on Monday. The side-scanning and 360-degree sonar being brought in by the FBI needs at least 6 feet of water to function, Breault said. Divers were expected to arrive Thursday but will probably wait until Friday to go into the water, she said. But Cook-Morrissey said Wednesday that she thinks it's unlikely the girls will be found there, suggesting they might have been kidnapped. ""They don't swim there. My daughter is familiar with swimming in lakes, so I don't think she would be scared of this lake, but they don't come here and swim here,"" she said. ""Because we haven't found them anywhere in the surrounding area, I feel like maybe they were taken."" And Lyric's grandmother, Wylma Cook, said she doesn't believe that the girls intended to go swimming. ""I don't think they would have even known the way to Meyers Lake,"" she told HLN's Nancy Grace on Tuesday. Cook-Morrissey said she'd be ""more comfortable"" with the theory that the girls might have been abducted ""once they drain the lake and we find nothing there."" ""If you've taken our kids,"" she said on national TV, ""bring them back."" Missing girl's grandma: 'We will fight' Authorities said Tuesday that they didn't know whether the girls had been at the lake. ""We have their bicycles, and we have the purse, and that doesn't tell me that they've been there, just that those items are there,"" Chief Deputy Rick Abben of the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office said. The family has been questioned and polygraphed and had information taken from their cell phones, a process Cook-Morrissey said is hard but necessary. ""We know that it's a necessary measure they have to take to get as much information as they can and of course rule us out, so we did what we have to do,"" she said. Mom: Dogs searching for Iowa girls stopped at edge of lake . Questioning has taken Cook-Morrissey and other family members away from the lake, which is hard, she said. ""Not that being out here might make a difference, but in your heart you want to be close to where they were last seen,"" she said. When Evansdale Mayor Chad Deutsch heard that two little girls were missing in his town, he said, the first thing he did was to make sure every city asset that was needed was made available to the county sheriff. The next thing he did was take to the air, taking off in his twin-engine plane and flew over his town, looking for any sign of Lyric and Elizabeth. ""It just makes you sick,"" said Deutsch, who knows both families. Family 'bracing for the worst but hoping for the best' In this town, neighbors know exactly how many people live there -- 4,751 -- and the small community in northeast Iowa has never suffered through anything like the worrying going on now, the mayor said. The search remains a missing persons case, authorities said. No evidence has been found to suggest this is a crime, Deutsch said, but it is a mystery that has the whole community looking for two of their own. ""We just want our girls home,"" Tammy Brousseau, an aunt to both girls, told CNN's ""AC360ÃÅ¡."" ""We're bracing for the worst but hoping for the best."" Calls are coming in to a tip line, Abben said, and each bit of information is being checked out. Police ask that anyone who may have seen the girls on Friday contact authorities. Heather Collins, Elizabeth's mother, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that if the girls were abducted, she would not pass judgment. ""We just want our children brought back,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- When I heard the news that Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer I was shocked and saddened. She was a woman clearly ahead of her time, blazing trails for all of those behind her, showing other women that it was possible to be smart, to care about science and to be an astronaut. After her death, it was revealed that she was gay, but it didn't totally surprise me. Being a lesbian myself, I admit I was proud to learn that such an accomplished American pioneer and role model was on ""our team."" Some are saying that she let the gay and lesbian community down, that she should have been more visible and should have publicly declared her sexual orientation. She could have made a contribution to gay rights. She could have inspired many young people struggling with their sexuality. But it isn't that easy. Especially for women like Sally and me, who grew up in the '50s and '60s. I retired from the Navy in June 2002 as a captain after nearly 30 years of living under ""don't ask, don't tell"" and its predecessor. Once I retired, I knew that I needed to add my voice to the fight against DADT, to be a visible example of a gay service member. However, outing myself beyond my close circle of friends wasn't easy. I was proud of my accomplishments but a big part of me wanted to keep my personal life private. In America: Sally Ride as role model . In my early career, most of my challenges, like those of Sally Ride I suspect, were trying to succeed in what was pretty much a man's world. No, Sally wasn't in the military -- but being a part of NASA had many similarities. I can see why she wanted to focus on succeeding as a woman, which was difficult enough, and didn't want to complicate things by bringing up her sexual orientation. More science news from CNN Light Years . She carried the burden of being the first American woman to go into space and all that it meant, and back then, she faced some pretty laughable questions. One was whether the flight would affect her reproductive organs. Former astronaut Rick Hauck, who was co-pilot on the 1983 Challenger mission with Sally, recalls another: A reporter asked: ""Do you think you will cry during the flight?"" and she answered: ""Why doesn't Rick get asked that question?"" There is still a long way to go. For example, Sally's partner of 27 years, Tam Shaughnessy, will not receive her federal survivor's benefits because it is prohibited by the Defense of Marriage Act. Still, a lot has changed rather quickly for the better. DADT has been repealed, and gays and lesbians are serving openly and successfully in the military. Marriage equality is beginning to take hold in several states, and campaigns such as the ""It Gets Better"" project are trying to send a message that it really is OK to be LGBT. Opinion: A friend remembers Sally Ride . Could Sally Ride have come out publicly before her death? Yes. But we should respect her choice to keep her personal life relatively private. Perhaps, if she had been fortunate to have lived a little longer, she might have decided that giving up some of her privacy was worth it to let people see her as an American hero who ""happened to be a lesbian."" I know thousands of LGBT kids might have been encouraged to learn Sally Ride was gay -- but we need to remember that those of us who grew up in the '50s and '60s, when many of us didn't even know what gay meant, are still on a journey of self-acceptance. I still marvel at so many young gay and lesbian kids when I see how accepting they are of themselves and how their straight peers accept them as ""normal."" Although I am retired and DADT is gone, I still hesitate to share I am a lesbian and am still surprised when people are totally fine with it. Opinion: Thank you, Sally Ride . Let's remember Sally Ride as a courageous pioneer and American hero. Let's not let the fact that she didn't publicly come out to the world detract in any way from her remarkable accomplishments. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joan Darrah.","Sally Ride kept her sexual preference a secret during her lifetime .
Some say Sally should have come out, Joan Darrah says, but it wasn't easy in her generation .
Darrah: When Sally and she grew up, being a woman in a man's world was hard enough .
Darrah: Ride should be remembered for her remarkable life, not for her orientation ."
"(CNN) -- The seven missing in London. That's what the headlines in the West African nation of Cameroon call the athletes who walked away from the Olympic village at the London Games. The Cameroon athletes -- five male boxers, a female footballer and a male swimmer -- walked away from the Olympic village last week, immediately raising questions about their intentions. While the Cameroon Olympic delegation has stopped short of saying the athletes planned to defect, at least one member of the country's national Olympic committee believes it's more than likely. ""Back home, they aren't giving the proper training. They know if they are well trained, they could beat the person from another country,"" Aka Amuam Joseph told CNN during a recent interview outside a sports training facility in Cameroon. Joseph also serves as a member of the Cameroon Karate Federation. ""It pains them to be here and see people beat them, who they can beat if they are well taken care of."" Nothing has been heard from the athletes since they went missing, said David Ojong, Cameroon's head of mission to London 2012, but said, but their compatriots ""hope and believe"" the athletes will rejoin the group before they return to Cameroon. Athletes competing at the London Games have visas that allow them to stay in the United Kingdom until November 8, according to authorities. Footballer Drusille Ngako, who was one of the team's reserve players, was the first of the seven to disappear. He went missing on July 26, Ojong said. Swimmer Paul Ekane Edingue and boxers, Thomas Essomba, Christian Donfack Adjoufack, Yhyacinthe Abdon Mewoli, Serge Ambomo and Blaise Yepmou Mendouo, haven't been seen since last Monday, he said. The Cameroonian delegation approached the Games organizers and the High Commission of Cameroon in London as soon as they became aware of the missing athletes, Ojong has said. Pictures of the athletes this week adorned the front pages of newspapers in Cameroon, including Le Jour which carried the banner headline: ""The Seven Missing in London."" Since the 1996 Games in Atlanta, dozens of athletes from Cameroon have defected. Cameroon, with a population of about 20 million, is one of the world's poorest nations, according to the International Monetary Fund. It has little money to develop top-notch training facilities, one of the reasons Joseph believes the athletes going looking for ""greener pastures."" ""Why do Nigerians not flee away? Why do people from South Africa not flee away? When you go there, you see infrastructure of the highest level,"" Joseph said. ""Why don't they flee? They know that what they find in Europe, they find back home."" The training facilities in Cameroon are spartan. It's Olympic boxing facility offers just one ring in a building with a concrete floor, peeling paint and wooden spectator benches. Its weight room offers a limited selection and a peeling carpet. ""I am positively convinced that if the government did more in this field, we would have little of this disturbance,"" Joseph said. Athletes and team officials have been allowed to seek permission to enter and remain in the United Kingdom without a visa from March 30 to November 8. CNN's Jo Shelley, Richard Allen Greene and journalist Tapang Ivo contributed to this report.","An Olympic official from Cameroon believes defection is likely .

"(CNN) -- The 19-year-old Michigan student with Down syndrome who drew national attention for his fight to play football at his high school will be allowed to suit up his senior year, his father said Thursday. The Michigan High School Athletic Association approved Eric Dompierre's request for a waiver to keep playing, even though he exceeds the state's official age limit, according to his father, who said he learned the news from the athletic director at Ishpeming High School. The Dompierre family had been petitioning the school and athletic association to create a waiver process for more than 2.5 years. They were pushing to give the teen, who was held back in kindergarten because of his disability and turned 19 in January, a way around rules that banned students from participating in high school athletics if they turned 19 before September 1. ""We're proud of the way Eric advocated for himself and kids like Eric. We're very grateful for all the people, tens of thousands of people, that stepped forward,"" Dean Dompierre, Eric's father, told CNN. The student's underdog quest to keep playing sports in Michigan's Upper Peninsula garnered widespread attention. An online petition on Change.org that was started on March 24 garnered more than 94,000 signatures. Yooper Shirts, a T-shirt store in Ishpeming, sold shirts that said ""let 'em play."" On the football field and the basketball court, the 19-year-old has shown flashes of athletic prowess, kicking an extra point near the end of a football game several years ago and hitting a 3-point shot in the basketball playoffs to help his team maintain a comfortable lead. In May, after the Dompierre family's lobbying, the athletic association created a new waiver process, allowing student athletes who turn 19 before September to play sports under ""narrowly defined"" circumstances. Under the new waiver rule, a student ""must have a defined disability documented to diminish both physical and either intellectual or emotional capabilities, does not create a health or safety risk to participants and does not create a competitive advantage for the team. The burden of proof rests with the school seeking the waiver,"" the association said in a statement. The age restriction is intended to prevent the possibility of injury or competitive advantage from an older, more developed athlete playing against younger students. ""The rule is 100 years old,"" Dean Dompierre told CNN in May. ""We've come a long way in those 100 years in this country in the way that we involve and include people with disabilities. And I think it's time that the rule catches up with that."" Eric Dompierre started practicing with the football team before the waiver was accepted, in hopes that he would be cleared. The rule change and waiver acceptance means he will be allowed to play as an extra point kicker on his high school football team. ""And when football is over, he'll try out for the basketball team he's been playing on for three years,"" Dean Dompierre told CNN Thursday. ""Thanks to all the people that signed the petition and spoke up. Without them, this couldn't have happened.""","The teen's father says officials have ruled he can play, despite age limits .

"(CNN) -- The attorney for Scott A. Smith, who was arrested after attending the latest Batman movie armed with a gun, ammunition and knives, said the deadly shooting in Aurora, Colorado, last month prompted his client to bring the weapons for protection. ""He had a fear and wanted to protect himself,"" attorney Matthew Bruce said Friday. Smith, 37, made his first appearance in court Thursday and is currently being held on $250,000 bond. He was arrested Saturday and charged with two counts of carrying a concealed weapon and 19 counts related to carrying weapons ""under disability,"" charges that refer to the effects of prescription drugs Smith was taking, said Nicole DiSanto of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office. Police say Saturday night Smith went to the Regal Theater in Westlake, Ohio, to see the 10:30 p.m. showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" CNN poll: Gun control attitudes haven't changed after shootings . According to DiSanto, Smith was the first to arrive, 30 minutes before the movie's start, and took a seat in the back row, directly in the middle, with his back to a wall. A manager at the theater and an off-duty police officer grew suspicious of where he sat, and they noticed the bag Smith was carrying. They asked to search the bag, DiSanto said, and inside found a loaded 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, two loaded magazine clips and three knives. Police said Smith was carrying another knife on his person. His attorney said he had arrived early to get the best seat in the theater. ""That's just the kind of person he is,"" said Bruce, who acknowledged that Smith was not carrying the gun legally. Smith told the off-duty officer he was carrying the gun and knives for protection, to protect himself and other moviegoers, said police, who took him into custody. A search of Smith's home turned up more weapons, including rifles, shotguns and survivalist gear. Analysis: Fewer U.S. gun owners own more guns . Westlake police Lt. Ray Arcuri said police believe Smith's position in the movie theater was ""tactical:"" not only was he protected from the back, but he could have fired to his right, left and center on anyone in the theater in front of him. About 80 people attended the movie that night. In 1995, Smith enlisted in the U.S. Army but did not finish basic training, according to Army spokesman George Wright. The charges against Smith follow the mass shooting last month in Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman fired on a crowd of moviegoers watching a showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises.""

"(CNN) -- A total of nine athletes, including Olympic bronze medalist Nataliya Tobias, have tested positive for ""sophisticated doping"" offenses, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has confirmed. Six of those athletes were caught using a new ""biological passport"" method, which builds up a profile of each individual over a prolonged period of time. The remaining three, including Tobias who came third in the women's 1500 meters in Beijing four years ago, were suspended after further analysis of samples they gave at the World Championships in Daegu last year. ""Today's announcements underline the IAAF's continued and unwavering campaign against doping in athletics,"" IAAF President Lamine Diack said in a statement on their official website. Greek athlete suspended from Olympic team for offensive remarks . ""They demonstrate the IAAF's commitment to use advanced methods to detect doping and to enforce increased sanctions when justified. ""We will not stint in our resolve to do everything in our power to eradicate cheating."" The IAAF said they had been collecting samples from various athletes in the build up to the Olympics and would conduct 200 more biological passports during the Games. That method accounted for six bans, for Morocco's Abderrahim Goumri, Greece's Irini Kokkinariou, Turkey's Meryem Erdogan, and three Russians -- Svetlana Klyuka, Nailiya Yulamanova and Yevgenina Zinurova, the 2011 European Indoors 800m champion. Along with Tobias, fellow Ukrainian Antonina Yefremova was charged after synthetic testosterone was found in their systems, while Bulgaria's Inna Eftimova tested positive for a synthetic growth hormone. All three athletes admitted the offense and waived their right to a ""B"" sample, meaning their four-year bans were halved. The six caught via the ""biological passport"" method were flagged as suspicious in 2009 and were found to have persistently used banned substances over a long period, the IAAF said. Four of the six -- Erdogan, Klyuka, Yulamanova and Zinurova -- admitted their offense and waived their right to a ""B"" sample, meaning their original four-year bans were cut in half. The IAAF said Goumri had recently received a four-year ban by the Moroccan Athletic Federation, but was permitted to appeal as the decision had not yet been ratified by the IAAF. Kokkinariou has been banned for two years by the Greek Athletic Federation but the IAAF said they were appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to have it doubled on the grounds of ""aggravating circumstances."" It was not immediately clear whether any of the nine athletes were part of Olympic teams set to participate in London 2012. Hero or villain? Ben Johnson and the dirtiest race in history .

"(CNN) -- Hey Mars! We're back! Hope you don't mind if we cruise around in our scientific SUV to grab some historic data and snap some breathtaking images. Oh, and we might do some Martian doughnuts in your front yard. Now that the Mars rover Curiosity is safely parked, NASA's unmanned planet crawler appears ready to roll. A car salesman would have a ball selling this beauty. It's loaded with an array of sophisticated cameras, a ""rocker bogie"" suspension, a robotic arm, 2 gigs of flash memory, a rock-vaporizing laser (!!!!) and a plutonium-fueled power system. It operates by remote control from millions of miles away and has a blazing top speed of 1.5 inches per second. Sticker price (including delivery): $2.6 billion. During its expected lifespan of 23 months, all this cool hardware could help solve big mysteries: Has life ever existed on Mars? What can Mars tell us about our own planet? Can we benefit from Martian resources? But there are less romantic questions swirling around the fourth rock from the sun: Is the price tag really worth it? Who will pay for the first manned mission to Mars? Could manned space missions be replaced by robotic exploration? The answers may be hard to see amid all the rover revelry. And this isn't the first time rovers have churned up this kind of excitement. In 1997, a smaller NASA robot on Mars -- Sojourner -- lit up the Web. ""Back when the Internet was young, it was the largest Internet event in the history of that medium,"" Curiosity team member James Bell told CNN on Monday. The little rover found clues suggesting that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere and liquid water. Sojourner and its parent spacecraft Pathfinder cost $265 million (PDF). ""Later, in 2004, when the Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed, it became one of the largest worldwide Internet sensations,"" said Bell, who also worked on that mission. ""It slammed NASA's website."" The rovers scored several discoveries including evidence of an ancient wet environment on Mars. Price tag for Spirit and Opportunity: $800 million (PDF). Nowadays -- at least for some space travel fans -- Martian robots aren't so cool anymore. Curiosity ""is just another box with wheels on Mars,"" says CNN commenter It_could_always_be_worse. ""Develop useful technology -- not this shooting of boxes with wheels all over the place. SEND PEOPLE, and I will be proud."" CNN commenter Max Lewes disagrees. ""This really was a HUGE leap from previous missions."" Related story: Curiosity's wild ride . After the initial excitement of Monday's landing, even the Curiosity team jokingly acknowledged the first dusty black and white photos from the rover have already lost their luster. ""It's not such a great picture anymore,"" a smiling Mike Watkins told reporters. He promised color and panorama photos in the coming days. Seriously, no matter how successful unmanned missions might be, robots will never replace the need for human space exploration, says Bell. In a sense, Curiosity is performing a scouting mission for a manned U.S. mission to Mars that President Barack Obama predicts will happen in his lifetime. NASA administrator Charles Bolden gets even more specific: Manned missions to Mars are at least 18 years away -- sometime in the 2030s. But first, mission planners need more information about the Martian surface so they can choose the best landing sites. ""We don't want astronauts to be surprised,"" says Bell. Robot missions, such as Surveyor, preceded the Apollo moon landings, and these Martian probes are performing similar tasks. Putting a monetary value on space exploration is impossible, experts say, because there are too many unanswered questions, such as whether Mars, the moon or asteroids hold precious minerals, water and cheap energy resources that could be mined and brought back to Earth. ""The reason to send humans will be because we have to,"" Bell says. ""If some things can be done by robots, they should be done by robots. But sending a drill rig to Mars or Jupiter's moon Europa to tap into an aquifer that may have living organisms in it -- those kinds of things will require people."" Then there's the unknown value of newly discovered knowledge. Scientists want to know what Mars can tell us about our own planet's climate and geology. That knowledge, experts say, could help solve difficult environmental problems on Earth. ""It's human nature to explore,"" says Bell. ""By going to difficult or dangerous places, we carry the rest of our species along with us. These stories become part of part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our shared need to explore the worlds around us. it's a human endeavor that is part science, part inspiration."" Related story: Earth loves Mars -- why we're crushing on the red planet . By the way, Curiosity has fostered jobs, says NASA; more than 7,000 people have worked on the project across 31 states. What's next? NASA plans test flights for Orion -- a spacecraft designed to carry astronauts outside low Earth orbit -- as soon as 2014. In 2017, NASA plans to launch Orion with a new heavy-lift rocket NASA calls the Space Launch System. But big questions remain: How would NASA pay for development of a landing vehicle? Or a vehicle for astronauts to travel on the Martian or lunar surface? Or how would it develop an astronaut habitat suitable for the months it would take to travel to Mars or to asteroids? NASA's proposed budget for 2013 is $17.7 billion -- $59 million less than 2012 (PDF). It includes a ""lower cost program"" for unmanned missions to Mars (PDF). For perspective, the Mars rover's $2.6 billion price tag equals about 14.7% of NASA's proposed 2013 budget. However, the budget also calls for more money for manned deep space programs, including almost $3 billion for Orion and the Space Launch System. In May, something happened right above our heads that gave us a glimpse into the future of Mars exploration. That's when the private firm SpaceX successfully docked its Dragon spacecraft with the orbiting international space station. NASA is studying a proposal -- referred to as Red Dragon -- that would use a SpaceX rocket for less-expensive unmanned missions to Mars. But robot missions are just stepping stones to what many experts say is a foregone conclusion.

"(CNN) -- The remake of the movie ""Sparkle"" seemed tailor-made for Whitney Houston. After years largely in the shadows, the 48-year-old singer took on a part that seemed to have parallels to real life. The story, a remake of the 1976 film of the same name, is loosely based on The Supremes, and follows three sisters who have to face the difficulties that come along with fame as their singing careers take off. The movie currently is in post-production for release late this summer. ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks portrays the title character, Sparkle, one of three sisters, and Houston plays their mother. ""When she (Houston) walked out there and began to perform, we were all just stunned at how well she did, not only with the singing but also with the acting as well,"" Bishop T.D. Jakes, who produced the movie, told CNN's Soledad O'Brien on Thursday. Jakes -- who will attend Houston's funeral on Saturday, a week after she was found dead at a Beverly Hills, California, hotel -- recalled being drawn to the script. ""I saw the original 'Sparkle' and loved it,"" he said. ""It spoke to hope and the resilience of the human spirit in the midst of the decadence of life."" He told CNN of the ""synergy"" between Houston and Sparks on and off the set, with Houston serving as a mentor. In the movie, Houston, who had a daughter of her own, plays a mother who had reached the apex of her career and had settled down to singing in her church, Jakes said. Sparkle is in the choir, poised to make her own move toward the big time. ""There is some interesting parallels between the script and the lives of the two women,"" Jakes said. Houston, who helped produced the film, chose to sing ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow,"" leaving everyone on the set teary-eyed, the pastor said. ""Sparkle"" is scheduled to hit the big screen on August 17, according to Sony Pictures Entertainment. Industry observers are waiting to see how ""Sparkle"" fares, perhaps in comparison to ""This Is It,"" the documentary film that showed Michael Jackson preparing for a series of London concerts. The film was released after Jackson died in June 2009. According to the website Box Office Mojo, the 2009 release of ""This Is It"" performed well at the box office for its genre. It ranked as the fourth highest-grossing Halloween debut on record, and grossed $34.4 million in five and a half days, according to the website. With ""Sparkle,"" Houston posthumously will showcase the talent that made her loved by millions since the 1980s. Her last film was 1996's ""The Preacher's Wife."" To Jakes and others, the movie was going to help relaunch Houston's career. ""We did not know that we would be left with the (film),"" Jakes said. ""I think it's a responsibility to hold in our hands her last cinematic production."" CNN's JD Cargill and Nischelle Turner contributed to this report.","Whitney Houston took her first movie role in 15 years .

"(CNN) -- Mars rover Curiosity beamed back a sweeping color panorama of the planet's surface Thursday, showing the rocky, reddish desert surrounding it and the mountain it will explore in the coming months. The 360-degree view captures the landscape of Gale Crater, where Curiosity touched down early Monday, and the foot of Mount Sharp -- the rover's primary scientific target. Mike Malin, whose company built the camera used to shoot the scene, said the shot was ""probably not the best pointed,"" but added, ""We hope we'll get many others."" The brightness of the image was boosted to compensate for the dim sunlight of the martian afternoon, but the colors were untouched, NASA said. Curiosity went through its paces ""flawlessly"" on its third full day on the planet, mission manager Michael Watkins said Thursday. The rover's mission is to determine whether Mars ever had an environment capable of supporting life, and its prime target is Mount Sharp, the 18,000-foot (5,500-meter) peak about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) to the south. Curiosity opening Martian frontier? Scientists hope the layers of rock that form the mountain will give them a timeline of the history of Mars. Curiosity mission planner Dawn Sumner said photographs like the ones beamed back by the rover, as well as others taken by probes in orbit, will be used to map a path to the mountain's base -- ""doing the best science we can along the way, but also keeping our eyes on that beautiful layered rock,"" she said. The rover is supposed to run for two years, but a previous rover, Opportunity, has been working on Mars since 2004 -- well beyond the three months NASA planned.

"(CNN) -- If ethical shopping has a star, it's Danny Seo, the celebrity eco-stylist who champions green consumerism from the pages of Organic Style magazine, where he's editor-at-large, as well as his books and TV appearances. Danny's way: Promoting a green lifestlye as fun and accessible for all. He's helped many of Hollywood's big hitters become more green, and been dubbed ""the new Martha Stewart"" for his enthusiasm, positivity and his practical approach to making our lives more environmentally friendly. ""Think big,"" he advises. ""Don't worry over the small things. If you drive a lot, invest in a hybrid. If you're renovating a house, invest in a super-efficient heating and cooling system. New floors? Think recycled nylon carpets made from old carpets (like Shaw flooring's Anso Nylon material). One big statement really counts."" He believes that being green doesn't have to be hard work and that we can all make a difference, while living stylish, comfortable lives. He should know. Danny's eco credentials were there from the start -- he was actually born on Earth Day (April 22) -- and he started trying to change the world at a prodigiously early age. He started an environmental group when he was 12, which grew into a national organization. He wrote his first book at 19. When reporters from the Washington Post were interviewing him about another topic and noticed his well-decorated eco apartment, suddenly he became a green lifestyle expert. But while he doesn't believe we need to give up shopping to save the planet -- far from it, that new flat screen TV you crave might actually use less energy than the tube version you already have -- he does believe that we should change the way we shop. ""We should be thoughtful consumers,"" says Danny. ""At the end of the day, we need things in our everyday life: groceries, clothes, cleaning products, transportation. I think we need to stop shopping as a weekend activity or as something to do when 'bored.' Instead, making purchases when you need to can lead to a more responsible form of shopping. ""If a refrigerator breaks and you can't repair it, then don't you need to buy a new one? Why not get the most energy efficient model you can find... that's a win-win scenario."" The cheaper and better option . Despite the upscale image of many stylish, environmentally-friendly products - and the perceived high cost of organic food -- Danny firmly believes that going eco doesn't have to be expensive. ""A Stella McCartney organic cotton T-shirt. Yes, it will be expensive,"" he says. ""But Stella McCartney has always been expensive. A JCPenney organic cotton T-shirt can also be bought for just $15. It all depends where you shop. ""For people who complain that hybrid cars are too expensive, why not look at used cars? I found a Toyota Prius with only 10,000 miles on it for about 40 percent off the sticker price. Not bad."" Because green issues are becoming much more a part of the public consciousness, big brands are ""greening"" their products and eco choices are becoming much more widely available - making it much easier for ordinary consumers to make the switch. ""About ten years ago, it was tough,"" he says. ""You had to order your recycled paper toilet paper via catalogue! Today, it's a lot easier to find everyday green products in stores all over the country. There's a huge demand for quality, well-made, stylish eco-friendly products. My work with JCPenney proves that going green has gone to the mainstream. ""You can buy Method non-toxic cleaning products in stores like Target, Duane Reade and even Staples stores. And all the mainstream grocery store chains carry a wide variety of organic foods... even generic food has gone organic!"" All of which means we are seeing a new generation of ecologically-aware shoppers. But they are not, as you might imagine, the young, early adopters. ""I get emails everyday from people asking, 'where can I find a green version of this or that.' And it's from people you'd never expect: My parents' generation. ""When I saw a Method hand soap sitting on my parents' kitchen counter, I knew things have changed."" For Danny, the key to successfully moving what was a marginal concern into the mainstream is showing people that the less polluting, less wasteful option doesn't have to be a pious choice -- it can actually be easier, cheaper and just as stylish as well. ""In my world, I do it with beautiful photos, inspiring text, and how-to information,"" he says. ""My books are full-color, gorgeous and fun. My TV segments are instructional, but solutions-oriented... not gloom and doom. And I make it easy with online resources, simple web clicks and right-to-the-point answers. No wasted time!""","Danny Seo has been called the 'new Martha Stewart"" for the green generation .
Upbeat and practical advice has been taken by Hollywood stars .

"(CNN) -- A century after her childhood inspiration Jim Thorpe won two gold medals at the Stockholm Olympics, synchronized swimmer Mary Killman will be competing in her first Games in London this year. Like the legendary athlete, Killman comes from a part Native American background in Oklahoma, and is a registered member of Citizen Potawatomi Nation (CPN). Thorpe, who grew up in the Sac and Fox Nation, was spoken of in hushed tones by her elders. ""I'm very proud of my background,"" Killman told CNN. Her tribe are proud of her as well, regularly highlighting her achievements in their publications. In her first solo synchronized swimming competition in 2003, Killman's routine was set to North American flute music and she wore a decoration of the CPN seal on her hip. While growing up, she visited the house where Thorpe had lived -- and he was the subject of one of her school projects. Thorpe was one of the greatest all-round athletes in sporting history, playing professional American football, baseball and basketball as well as his track and field exploits -- he won gold in the pentathlon and decathlon at the 1912 Olympics. He was controversially stripped of his Olympic medals when it was discovered he had earned a few dollars while playing semi- professional baseball, but the International Olympic Committee restored them in 1983 -- 30 years after he died in poverty. Effortless performance . While she has a long way to go to match Thorpe's Olympic achievements, Killman is already making her name in a sport where the required elegance and good timing in the pool is forged by a grueling training regime of up to 60 hours per week. But all the work in the water paid off when she and duet partner Mariya Koroleva qualified for the 2012 London Olympics earlier this year. A seventh-placed finish at the Olympic qualification event at the Aquatic Center in London served notice of their potential and sealed a place in the Games proper. At just 21, Killman will be the youngest member of the United States team and will be gaining valuable experience. Denise Shiveley, the national team manager for the squad, has high hopes for Killman and Koroleva, who has taken a break from her studies at Stanford University to concentrate on the Olympics. They formed their partnership only last year and soon won the silver medal at the Pan-American Games behind Canada. ""They are both so young but their goal will be continue to improve and to keep getting better,"" Shiveley told CNN. Early years . Killman was already a competitive swimmer in Texas when she was first introduced to synchro, aged 11. ""One of my friends invited me over to a summer program that she had got involved with and I absolutely fell in love with it,"" she said. ""The combination of music and athletics was amazing. It was something I felt I could do it for a long time. "" Showing early talent, Killman has made steady improvement each year, winning a clutch of junior and age group national titles, competing in both the solo discipline and duets. Her first team was Pirouettes of Texas, where she was inspired to greater things by the exploits of Sarah Lowe, who represented the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. ""I also looked up a lot to Ana Kozlova, a three-time Olympian, who won bronze in the duet in Athens,"" said Killman, who now competes for the Santa Clara club in California. Grueling regime . To reach that medal-winning standard at major games, Killman knows that many hours of training are required both in the pool and gym. ""I train between eight and 10 hours per day, "" she said. Two three to four hour sessions in the pool are interspersed with a weight-training program that lasts about an hour. This schedule is repeated six days a week, and absolute dedication is required. ""It's mentally difficult just to push yourself that hard every day. A lot of people don't realize just how difficult it is,"" she admitted. MK squared . All that hard work has started to pay off, particularly since she formed her partnership with Koroleva last year. At 22, Koroleva is slightly older but they had known each other after competing for several years at the same competitions and they have formed a strong friendship. ""She's like a sister to me,"" said Killman. ""We have to think the same, we have to hear music the same and we have to go to practice everyday and spend eight to 10 hours in the water with just each other."" Fellow U.S. squad team members have coined a nickname for the pair: ""MK squared"" as they share the same initials and have the same tastes. Olympic dreams . The duo will go into their first Games without the pressure of medal expectation in a sport currently dominated by Russia, China and Spain. But Killman is certainly not writing off their chances of causing an upset. ""There's always that chance that if we push ourselves hard maybe just maybe we can reach the podium,"" she said. ""This is it, this is what we've been working for. We really want to go out and show what we can do. "" With synchronized swimmers reaching their peak from their mid-20s onwards, Rio in 2016 remains a long-term target for Killman.","Mary Killman will be competing in her first Olympics in London .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When Chinese teenager Ye Shiwen dives into the pool on Monday, all eyes will be firmly on the clock to see if she can repeat her world-beating -- Ryan Lochte-beating -- time in the last 50 meters. The 16-year-old is due to swim the heat of the 200 meter individual medley after taking gold in the 400 meter event on Saturday. It wasn't just the win that captured the world's attention, although she did clinch gold after beating American champion Elizabeth Beisel and smashing the world record in 4 minutes 28.43 seconds. The clock also showed that in the last 50 meters Ye swam faster than U.S. swimmer Lochte who won gold in the men's 400-meter individual medley the same night. Lochte vs. Phelps: Swimmer showdown heats up the Web . Ye, who wasn't among the race's favorites, clocked in 28.93 seconds in her final 50 meters of the competition's last 100 meter, freestyle leg, while Lochte went 29.10 seconds in his final 50. Sports pundits also pointed out the Chinese athlete broke the record previously set by Stephanie Rice in the 2008 Beijing Olympics; the Australian swimmer did it with the aid of a polyurethane suit, which is now banned. In Monday's 200 meter individual medley heats Shiwen finished 1.61 seconds clear of Kirsty Coventry in second, and 3.33 seconds ahead of 2008 Beijing Olympic champion Rice. Lochte, 27, who holds various world swimming records, said on Sunday: ""It was pretty impressive. And it was a female. She's fast. If she was there with me, I don't know, she might have beat me."" Not surprisingly, Chinese compatriots, from athletes to ordinary citizens, heaped praise on the swimming sensation. The hurdler champion Liu Xiang said, ""Ye Shiwen, she shocked me!"" while one netizen said: ""Ye is only 16! Sixteen is the age at which I am doing my homework at home while she wins the gold medal."" Even the swimmer herself was surprised. ""I dreamed of winning the gold medal, but I never ever expected to break the record. So I am overwhelmed,"" Ye said in quotes carried Monday in the state-run China Daily. Ye's swift time apparently caught commentators in the UK by surprise. BBC Olympic presenter Clare Balding provoked criticism by making remarks some interpreted as a suggestion that Ye had been cheating. Turning to her co-presenter former British Olympian Mark Foster, Balding asked: ""How many questions will be there, Mark, about someone who can suddenly swim much faster than she has ever swum before?"" Lochte wins maiden U.S. gold as Phelps flounders . Users on China's version of Twitter jumped to Ye's defense. ""Don't suspect other people's success while you never saw how hard they fought for it,"" wrote one netizen on Sina Weibo, while another wrote: ""Why doubt her success? She has won the match and that's it, disgusting BBC."" According to a profile in the China Daily last year, Ye was just seven years old when she told her mother she wanted to become a swimmer. She joined the Zhejiang provincial swimming team in 2007 and the national team the year after. Since the age of 14, Ye has scored a number of victories in national and international competitions. She took the top spots in the 200 meter individual medleys in the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou and the 2011 World Aquatic Championships in Shanghai. Ye has attributed her success to her training regime.

"Sydney (CNN) -- Australia's Qantas Airways said it plans to resume flights Monday afternoon after a government labor board ordered it to end a dispute with its unions that grounded the airline over the weekend. Qantas jets will resume service over the next 24 hours in a ""safe and phased approach,"" company CEO Alan Joyce told reporters Monday morning. Labor relations tribunal Fair Work Australia ordered an end to the labor dispute ""to avoid significant damage to the tourism industry"" after Qantas grounded its jets Saturday afternoon.The airline grounded 447 flights since Saturday and announced it would be locking out its unionized pilots, engineers, ramp, baggage and catering crews effective Monday evening amid a dispute with the unions that has dragged on for 14 months, the board said. Qantas argued that the unions' demands would leave the airline ""seriously impaired or destroyed."" The labor board gave the two sides three weeks to reach an agreement, with a possible three-week extension if talks were making progress. The decision ""provides certainty for Qantas passengers,"" Joyce said in a statement following the decision. He apologized to passengers and said flights would resume as early as Monday afternoon. The Australian and International Pilots Association said it hoped for a ""positive outcome"" from the talks, calling the decision to ground the airline a ""gross overreaction"" to its demands. ""It is a sign that the current management has lost touch with the traveling public, its workers and the basic Australian ethos of free speech,"" the union said in a statement. At Sydney airport, columns of ""canceled"" illuminated the departure board. Throngs of weary passengers crowded the help desk to rebook with other airlines, as suitcases lay scattered all over the floor. ""It makes me wonder whether I would book with Qantas again,"" said Isabelle Storer, who was stuck at the airport with her husband after a visit to the United States. Their connection to Adelaide was canceled, leaving her frustrated because her husband needed medical treatment, she said. Passenger Ron Fuller waited at the airport, albeit more optimistic. ""For a month or two, everyone will be anti-Qantas, there's no doubt about that,"" Fuller said. ""But emotion probably gets in the way sometimes."" The labor dispute involves three unions representing air and ground staff of Australia's largest domestic and international airline. Union officials have accused the airline of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs and of putting profits first. Pay and working conditions have also been at the center of the disputes. The industrial action is aimed at ensuring Qantas will not have enough funds to set up overseas operations that will jeopardize job security, union officials said. The move comes at an embarrassing moment for Australia, which is hosting dozens of heads of government and their staffs for the Commonwealth meeting in Perth. Qantas CEO Joyce has come under fire for grounding the fleet, which was preceded by weeks of tension between the airline and its workers. It's ""a maniacal overreaction,"" said Richard Woodward, vice president of the Australian and International Pilots' Union. The decision to ground the Qantas fleet, stranding thousands of passengers around the world, was unnecessary and grossly irresponsible, he said in a statement. In a statement, the Transport Workers Union of Australia described the cancellations as ""disgraceful"" and aimed at destroying the airline. Qantas, which has its headquarters in Sydney, is the second oldest airline in the world, and marked its 90th anniversary last year. It employs about 32,500 people and flies to more than 180 destinations worldwide, according to the company website. CNN's Hugh Williams contributed to this report.","NEW: Qantas says flights will resume Monday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- When Tyson Gay sprinted to three gold medals at the 2007 world championships, it looked like the American would be athletics' next superstar -- but that dream unraveled as another man emerged to conquer all. Usain Bolt was the name on everyone's lips after the Beijing Olympics the following year, when a hamstring injury meant Gay could only compete in the 100 meters -- and he didn't even reach the final. However, 2012 finds the 29-year-old from Lexington, Kentucky, in prime condition and ready to challenge Jamaica's world record-holder in London in August. CNN's Human to Hero series tracked down Gay as he prepares for battle with Bolt in the UK capital, having decided to focus on the 100m event in June's U.S. trials. Starting out . ""I played football in high school, I played baseball when I was younger, things like that, but I think it was the passion I had for track where you want to do an individual sport and be the best, I think -- there's nothing that can replace that."" Gay's promise on the track was clear from an early age, though it wasn't until he had turned 14 that he could beat his older sister Tiffany, who he says has inspired him. He became a three-time 100m state champion at Lafayette High School and his time of 10.46 seconds in a 2001 state meeting remains a record. He was the first athlete in history from the University of Arkansas to claim a National College 100m title. Heroes . Gay says an illustrious American quintet of Olympic medal winners have proved an inspiration to his career. Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson, who share 13 Olympic gold medals between them, are joined by the legendary Jesse Owens, who won four golds at the Berlin Games of 1936. Jon Drummond, who won a gold and a silver in Atlanta in 1996, and Maurice Greene, who secured two golds at Sydney in 2000, complete the list. ""When I grew up Carl Lewis was still running, Maurice Greene was running -- he was that figure I see, like Michael Johnson. I really wanted to look up to the fast guys -- so those two guys were some of the guys I looked up to. ""In history class at school it was Jesse Owens. You had to learn about him first before you got to Maurice Greene and those guys. ""I do some training with Jon Drummond -- he's given me a lot of great advice. Maurice Greene as well. He'll text me sometimes to check how I'm doing to see how an injury is going. That really means a lot to me."" London 2012 . Gay has never made an Olympic final but is intent on breaking that run in London when, once again, 100m and 200m world record-holder Bolt will be the man to beat. ""This is my biggest Games. I think this is me in my prime. I'm gonna be fit and ready. I'm gonna put everything into this one,"" Gay said. ""I really believe it's going to be one of the most exciting Olympics in history. I want to run with the best, that's how I've always lived. ""Basically, last year I ran on one leg and ran 9.7 seconds. I know I can be a lot more dangerous as long as I stay healthy and get a lot stronger in the weight room. ""I haven't been to an Olympic final yet, so I know it's going to be a different type of atmosphere but I'm thinking I can control it. ""I've really learned over the years how to control my adrenaline and let it all out when they shoot the gun versus letting the crowd and the lights and the camera get to me.

"(CNN) -- Everyone expected Jamaican flags to be flying high after the 100 meters final at the 2011 World Athletics Championships -- but no-one predicted that Usain Bolt would not be performing his customary celebration rituals. The world's fastest man had to watch as his training partner Yohan Blake took his title in South Korea, with the Olympic champion having been disqualified for a false start. The furore over Bolt's predicament completely overshadowed the achievement of his 22-year-old compatriot, who became the youngest world champion since U.S. sprint legend Carl Lewis was crowned in 1983 aged just 21. They are firm friends as well as training partners, but when the starting gun sounds at this year's London Olympics, there will only be one thing on Blake's mind -- scooping another one of Bolt's titles. Bolt won the 100m and 200m events in record times at Beijing 2008, and earned a third gold in the 4x100m relay, but Blake is closing the gap on his idol with personal bests last year. CNN's Human to Hero show caught up with the boy from St. James as he turns his attention to performing on the biggest stage of all. Early days . Blake's sprinting career took off in his early teens when he was spotted running at his school in Spanish Town, and he made a big impression at the Carifta Games -- a Caribbean track and field meeting for young athletes. ""Somebody just saw me running, went up to my school principal and said 'You've got a new track star there,"" and from there it started, from the age of 15 or so I started running,"" he says. ""When I was in High School I ran the Jamaican national junior record of 10.11 seconds. I was running at the Carifta Games when I ran 10.18 secs in the semis. And I ran 10.11 in the final, so from there I knew I could do something great. ""I think it's fate because I believe in fate and that it leads towards good things."" Heroes . ""I really have to look up to Usain Bolt because of what he has done. Just to be his training partner and know what he thinks and know what he can do -- I have to look up to him. ""Asafa Powell (100m world record holder between June 2005 and May 2008) started it back in the day, and for a guy to do that to put Jamaica on the world stage and say 'Look, Jamaica can dominate the world,' I have to look up to someone like that that even though he did not get a world medal at the time. He has put Jamaica out there."" Gold in Daegu . Blake posted a time of 9.92 seconds, enough to beat a strong field in the final but still well short of Bolt's world record of 9.58. ""What happened at Daegu -- Usain Bolt is on the world stage and people are always going to look at that,"" Blake says. ""But I think I turned people's minds. It wasn't a fluke, so I think when they look back on Daegu they'll say, 'Oh, there's a young man who is going to challenge him.' "" London 2012 . ""My first time going into the Olympics, you know, I think it is going to be a breathtaking moment for me. I want to go to the Olympics, have some fun and come back home with some medals. ""When I feel it is a big stage for me as the Olympics is where the big times, the big things really happen because an Olympic medal would really mean a lot. ""It makes more sponsors come out to you, so going out to the Olympics is going to be a really wonderful gift for me, really."" The competition . ""When you have Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell, Usain Bolt and myself lining up for the 100m, I'm always excited because the competition is really good and I want to be the best person on the day, the best person to execute well,"" Blake says. ""I think that is what the world wants to see. It's going to be really interesting, all them guys they come out feeling fit and feeling ready to go.

"(CNN) -- Former world champion Jessica Ennis is one of Great Britain's big medal hopes for the London 2012 Olympics. She has established herself as one of the top competitors in the seven-discipline heptathlon event, winning the gold medal at the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin. A year later she added the World Indoor pentathlon title to a growing list of accolades, as well as the European heptathlon crown. Having started her senior athletics career in 2006, Ennis immediately made an impact by taking bronze in the heptathlon at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia. CNN's Human to Hero series caught up with her during her preparations for her debut Summer Olympics in the UK capital. Early days . ""I started athletics when I was 10 years old. At that stage it was just a great opportunity to go and make loads of good friends, run around, do things and try events that I really enjoyed. ""It was when I got to the age of about 14-15 that I got picked for my first Great Britain international and I saw a completely different side of athletics. Something that was my hobby now had a really competitive side to it and I thought this is something I really want to do for a long time. ""When I started I tried everything -- the coach I was with wanted me to keep my options open and try all the different events and see where my talent lay. He believed in me and believed I could be a good heptathelete so I decided to give them all a go."" Heroes . ""I didn't particularly have one role model growing up. I remember watching a number of British athletes compete, it was a generation where every athlete was doing well -- Seb Coe, Steve Backley, Mick Hill, Sally Gunnell -- they inspired me. ""But I'm really inspired by the people around me. My family, my parents who introduced me to the sport and really got me where I am today."" Career high . ""Winning the gold medal at the (2009) world championships in Berlin after the previous year missing the (Beijing) Olympics through injury. That was a real highlight of my career."" Ennis' tally of 6,731 points saw her finish 238 points ahead of second-placed Jennifer Oeser from Germany and 260 ahead of Poland's Kamila Chudzik. Career low . ""2008 was a really tough year. I was in great shape and really looking forward to my first Olympics. Then I picked up this injury that meant I would have to miss it. ""It was a real disappointment. It was the first major injury I had had as an athlete and it made me questions a lot of things and I felt really unlucky and it was really, really disappointing. It was hard to get myself up after that."" In May 2008, Ennis withdrew from a heptathlon competition complaining of pain in her right foot. A scan revealed three stress fractures. Sporting philosophy . ""As a sportsperson you have massive highs and lows throughout your career. But it's having the people, the support around you to get through those low points and really enjoy the high points. You've got to work for them, you've got to expect that they are going to come. It's just about working through (low points) because you always come out the other end and that makes (winning) that little more sweet."" London 2012 . ""It's a very surreal year for all the British athletes, I think. It's something we've not experienced before and it's going to be great.""","British heptathlete Jessica Ennis is one of the favorites to take gold at the London Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Equestrian champion Ingrid Klimke could ride a horse before she could walk, such is the fondness her family holds for the animals. The German's father, Reiner, won an incredible six Olympic gold medals spread across five separate installments of the Games between 1964 and 1988 before his death in 1999. His dream was for one of his children to follow in his footsteps and participate at the Games, which Ingrid duly did in Sydney in 2000. And eight years later Ingrid became the second Klimke to clinch a gold medal when she was part of the German three-day eventing team that triumphed at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Klimke has now competed in three Olympics and has also claimed a host of domestic and international titles over a 21-year career in the sport. CNN's Human to Hero show caught up with the 43-year-old and her horse FRH Butts Abraxxas, nicknamed ""Braxx,"" at her home in Munster, Germany as she prepares to saddle up for her fourth Olympics in London. Starting out . ""My mother says that I could ride, or sit on a horse before I could walk. I just grew up with horses,"" Klimke told CNN. The 43-year-old did a Masters in Equestrian Management after university and trained in dressage, stadium jumping and three-day eventing. Klimke began competing in the late 1980s and opened her own stables in 1998. Heroes . It is no surprise Klimke's father has been the most influential person in her career. Learning from a five-time Olympian has helped shape her own successful path in the sport. ""My father was a wonderful dressage rider, but he also started with eventing. In 1960 he took part at the Olympics in Rome as an eventer, but then afterward he started doing dressage,"" she said. ""He counted in Olympic years because for him the Olympics was just his thing. His dream was that one of his children would go to the Olympics. ""Later I could work out whether I preferred more dressage or more eventing -- that's why I still do both."" Setbacks . Injuries are part and parcel of any rider's career, and Klimke has had her fair share of bumps and bruises. ""I think if you have a life with horses you have injuries, and I've had some falls,"" she said. ""Last year I fell at Badminton (England's prestigious horse trials) and I damaged my knee -- so that put me out for three months right in the middle of the season. You always have to take your time to come back."" Olympic memories . Klimke's appearance in London will be her fourth Olympics, having competed in Sydney, Athens and Beijing, but her gold at the Games in China was her first. ""Sydney was my first four-star event and it was a very tough, long course, 13 minutes up and down. It was hot!"" she said. ""The Olympics is the thing I grew up with and that's why I keep going with my next generation of horses, hoping one of them will be able to follow in Braxx's footsteps. ""You must always have dreams and goals never rest, never think you have had it all -- then it is better to quit -- but I would love to keep going.""","Germany's Ingrid Klimke to compete in her fourth Olympics in London this year .

"(Time.com) -- Last week, a U.S. District judge dealt a serious blow to Google and Samsung by slapping an injunction on the Galaxy Nexus phone and the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in a patent infringement lawsuit. Although Judge Lucy Koh hasn't found Samsung guilty of patent infringement--not yet, anyway--she ruled that Apple would suffer irreparable harm if the two Android devices were found to infringe Apple patents and remained on sale during the trial. Time.com: Per Apple request, judge orders Samsung to halg Galaxy tablet sales . The Galaxy Nexus is Google's lead Android device, so Koh's ruling is the biggest patent setback for Android to date. (Samsung has appealed Koh's ruling.) I'm not a lawyer or a shareholder in any of the companies involved, so I'm less concerned with the legal maneuvering than I am with the patent wars' effects on consumers. Let's take a look at what the injunctions and the greater mobile patent wars mean for the people who are actually using the products: . Are existing users affected? If you own a Galaxy Nexus or Galaxy Tab 10.1, no one's going to show up at your doorstep and ask for it back. Your device will continue to work, but there's always a chance that Google or Samsung may tweak their software in future updates to work around claims of patent infringement. My Galaxy S II, for instance, lost its ""overscroll bounce"" effect in an update late last year, and I suspect this was done to avoid a patent claim that Apple has wielded against other companies. Time.com: Going Android: An experiment . The patents at issue in the Samsung case deal with universal search, predictive text, slide-to-unlock and the ability to select an action when you tap on certain types of text. It's not yet clear whether Google and Samsung can come up with workarounds. Can you still buy a Galaxy Nexus or Galaxy Tab 10.1? I can't find the original Galaxy Tab 10.1 online, aside from a few refurbished units, but the device is now a year old and not worth buying. I'm guessing most retailers had already stopped selling it. Instead, you can get the Tab 2 10.1, which remains on sale at Best Buy and elsewhere. The unlocked Galaxy Nexus remains on sale on Google's website, but we'll see what happens once Apple posts a $96 million bond that's required to set the ban in motion. (If Samsung prevails at trial, it will get that bond money to make up for lost sales.) A Verizon store clerk, meanwhile, told Mashable's Lance Ulanoff that the carrier will sell its remaining Galaxy Nexus stock, but can't import any more units. Time.com: China court orders Apple to pay $60 million to settle iPad name dispute . Are all Android devices now doomed? Aside from Samsung, Apple has also sued Motorola and HTC for patent infringement. The U.S. International Trade Commission found HTC guilty of infringing two patents, and its latest phones were briefly held up at customs in May while the company's workarounds were approved. Apple claims that the workaround isn't good enough, so HTC's not out of the woods yet, but at the moment HTC's Android phones are widely available. Motorola also seems safe for the moment, following U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's decision to dismiss the entire case of Apple v. Motorola. Posner said neither side could prove damages, and Apple couldn't show that an injunction would benefit itself more than it would hurt Motorola. Apple will most likely appeal the ruling. Are Apple products at risk? Of course, Apple's rivals have filed counter-suits. The problem for Samsung and Motorola is that they're relying on ""standard-essential"" patents that are required for telecommunications, and must be licensed on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The Federal Trade Commission is currently investigating Motorola, which is suing both Apple and Microsoft, over its use of these standard-essential patents to score injunctions. If the FTC requires Motorola to license its patents, the company will lose its ability to get Apple products banned. This article originally appeared on Time.com: Apple wins ban on two Android devices: What it means for you .","Google and Samsung will halt sales of the Galaxy Nexus phone and the Galaxy Tab 10.1.

"(CNN) -- One firefighter was injured during the night while battling wildfires that are causing evacuations in Northern California, a fire official said Monday. Two fires were burning, affecting about 5,000 acres, according to Julie Hutchinson of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. She said the fires started about the same time Sunday. Hutchinson didn't have an update on the medical status of the firefighter injured. Three subdivisions are under mandatory evacuation orders, including 480 homes in Long Valley and Spring Valley in Lake County. The larger of the two fires -- 3,000 acres -- threatens those communities and has destroyed three buildings already. The fire is 25% contained, Hutchinson said. The other fire -- burning not far away along the same road, California State Highway 20 -- is 2,000 acres, causing fire officials to order to order people in Wilbur Hot Springs to leave. The fire is 30% contained. Officials say the fires likely will stay separated. About 320 fire personnel were fighting the fires, Hutchinson said.

"(CNN) -- When I saw the story, my jaw dropped. Has journalism deteriorated so badly that Barack Obama's campaign aides are allowed to send quotes to reporters that ""come back redacted, stripped of colorful metaphors, colloquial language and anything even mildly provocative,"" as The New York Times reported. It's called ""quote approval,"" and it's quite a problem. It's also, as the Times noted, not a practice limited to Team Obama. ""Quote approval is standard practice for the Obama campaign, used by many top strategists and almost all midlevel aides in Chicago and at the White House,"" the story reported. ""It is also commonplace throughout Washington and on the campaign trail."" Some Mitt Romney staffers are afforded the same privilege, the Times said. Dan Rather: Quote approval a media sellout . Ten years ago when I was White House press secretary, before Twitter and Facebook, in an era when reporters used to pick up their phones to conduct interviews as opposed to e-mailing, I would have been laughed out of the briefing room if I tried to get quote approval for something I said. Occasionally, I talked on background as a senior administration official, but no reporter would ever let me pick and choose which on-the-record quotes they could use nor would anyone let me edit or clean up a quote. My how things have changed -- and the change began, it's important to note -- toward the end of the second term of George W. Bush. Peter Baker, another reporter at The New York Times who has covered the last three White Houses, told me in an (on-the-record) interview that quote approval evolved from something beneficial to a ""pernicious practice to be avoided."" Like Prohibition, it began with good intent. Reporters covering Bush's second term, under pressure from editors not to use unnamed sources in their stories, started asking their sources if a background quote, attributed to a senior aide, could instead be turned into an on-the-record quote, with the aide's name in print. I e-mailed last week with several former Bush staffers and many confirmed they engaged in that practice. For a very limited number of the most senior aides, that made sense. Let's say a reporter is talking to a knowledgeable aide at the National Security Council who won't speak for attribution, because their job is not to talk to the press. Their boss won't like it if they do, or their phone will ring off the hook with 20 other reporters who want to turn the aide into a press secretary. But the aide will talk to an occasional reporter because their conversation, often about complicated policy matters, may inform the reporter and lead to a more accurate, more nuanced story. But since the reporter can't quote the official by name, and editors don't want to use unnamed sources, what's a reporter to do? So reporters began pushing back, persuading staffers to let one sentence be quoted by name. The sentence was e-mailed to the aide, and when permission was granted to use it, quote approval among the most senior aides got started. Sunday's Media monitor . But pushback has now turned into quote approval for almost everyone, even when the story isn't nuanced or complicated, and that's where the problem begins. Reporters are easily acquiescing today to midlevel aides who seek quote approval. These aides aren't talking to make certain a story is more nuanced or better informed. They're doing it because they want more control of the story or to clean up a sloppy quote -- and because reporters let them. Baker called it an ""effort to get more transparency but it's backfired. The town has found a convenient way to control the press,"" he said, referring to people throughout Washington and on the campaign trail. As a former press secretary, I'm all for trying to control the press, but quote approval goes too far. Ron Fournier, the editor-in-chief of the National Journal group, reportedly sent an e-mail to reporters who work for him declaring quote approval off limits. ""Our policy and common sense dictate that we don't allow public officials to edit NJ coverage,"" he wrote. The problem with quote approval is it's too easy. It turns the relationship between a source and a reporter entirely over to the source. And the practice has spread too far and wide. Too many staffers will speak only if their quotes are approved and too many reporters are happy to oblige. The relationship between a source and the press will always resemble a tug-of-war. Since the early days of our republic, government officials and the media have clashed. It's part of the ongoing, generally healthy dynamic in our noisy democracy. Over time, the ground shifts and one party gains the upper hand, only to lose it back. Of course, the media's focus on the trivial -- see coverage of Romney's trip to England -- makes sources fight even more for control, lest a sentence be misconstrued, exaggerated and hyperfocused. But so long as reporters allow their sources quote approval, this round has been won by the sources. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ari Fleischer.","Former White House press secretary says balance of power dominated by officials .
He says making reporters submit quotes in advance for approval goes too far .

"(CNN) -- Gas prices jumped 18 cents over the past two weeks, the biggest jump of the year, according to a survey published Sunday. The average cost of a gallon of regular is $3.69 nationwide, the Lundberg Survey found. That's nearly 8 cents higher than a year ago, but still 28 cents lower than it was in April of this year. ""Higher crude oil prices, higher corn-based ethanol prices, plus a spate of refinery and pipeline problems around the country combined"" are behind the spike, said publisher Trilby Lundberg. The U.S. drought is pushing up prices for all corn-based products. It's impossible to predict what will happen with gas prices in the near future, Lundberg said. ""The refinery and pipeline issues that have added to the price rise are certainly temporary in nature. But the other two -- the ethanol price rises and the higher crude oil prices -- aren't so easily dismissed as immediately temporary."" But, Lundberg said, she doubts prices will jump this quickly in the near future because many of the refinery issues are being resolved. The Lundberg Survey tabulates prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide. The city with the highest average in the latest survey was Chicago, at $4.23. The lowest average price was in Tucson, Arizona, at $3.18. Here are average prices in some other cities: . - Boston, Massachusetts - $3.74 . - Charleston, South Carolina - $3.43 . - Atlanta, Georgia - $3.64 . - Indianapolis, Indiana - $3.84 . - Denver, Colorado - $3.45 . - Tulsa, Oklahoma - $3.54 . - Portland, Oregon - $3.74 . - San Francisco, California - $4.06 .","The national average jumped 18 cents over two weeks, the Lundberg Survey finds .

"(CNN) -- One international peacekeeper was shot dead and another was wounded early Sunday after a ""gang"" attacked their police post inside a refugee camp in Sudan's embattled Darfur region, the African Union - United Nations Mission said. The incident came amid continued fighting, much of pitting armed militia groups against Sudanese government forces in the region, which is near Sudan's border with the new nation of South Sudan. Late last week, for instance, U.N. officials said all 25,000 people living in another Darfur refugee camp -- this one the Kassab camp, in north Darfur -- fled due to ongoing violence. As to the latest incident, the joint mission, known as UNAMID, said in a statement Sunday that a ""gang surrounded"" its community policing center inside the Otash refugee camp in Nyala, South Darfur. The armed men then began shooting, killing a peacekeeper from Bangladesh around 3:15 a.m. and wounding another, according to UNAMID. The infiltrators fled the scene after the A.U.-U.N. police unit returned fire, the mission said. ""The attack on our peacekeepers is cowardly (and) deplorable and our thoughts go to the families and friends of the fallen and the injured,"" said Aichatou Mindaoudou, acting joint special representative for the mission. Mindaoudou urged Sudan's government to make a concerted bid to apprehend those responsible for the shooting, which she called a war crime under international law. Violence has plagued Darfur for nearly a decade. The United Nations estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed and almost 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since the Darfur conflict broke out in 2003. In March of this year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudan's defense minister for 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Darfur region. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is also wanted for crimes against humanity by the ICC in connection with the conflict. Chris Cycmanick, head of media relations for UNAMID, told CNN late last week that there was a drop in civilian casualties between 2010 and 2011 in Darfur, ""but recently there has been an uptick in criminal activity."" ""The situation is troublesome, it is not supposed to be happening in Darfur, but there is still fighting going on,"" Cycmanick said. A UNAMID statement issued last Monday said the latest round of violence began after an incident on August 1, when three armed men carjacked the local district commissioner and his driver and shot them dead. ""Subsequently, on the same day armed men surrounded Kassab, looted the market, burnt down the Sudanese Police post in the camp and reportedly killed four persons (three civilians and one police officer) and injured six others,"" the statement said. Security continued to deteriorate over the following days in Kutum town, Kassab camp and another camp, Fataborno, ""including fighting between the armed elements and government forces, as well as looting and displacement of civilians,"" it said. Nyala, where the early Sunday morning attack occurred, is about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Kutum. According to a paper published last month by the independent monitoring group Small Arms Survey, violence has picked up of late since new non-Arab ""Popular Defense Forces"" have been recruited, trained and armed by the Sudanese government since late 2010 to force Zaghawa rebel groups out of a swath of the eastern Darfur region. As a result, about 70,000 people had been displaced by mid-2011, and retaliatory attacks by both sides continue, the group said in its paper. Meanwhile, aerial bombardment has been used to target rebel forces and civilian villages believed to support them, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Weapons and ammunition also continue to flow into the hands of proxy forces and government forces in defiance of a ""wholly ineffective"" embargo on Darfur, the group reported. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","African Union - United Nations peacekeepers are attacked in a Darfur refugee camp .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The death toll from a pair of earthquakes that jolted Iran on Saturday has escalated once again, state-run media reported Monday. At least 306 people have been killed and 3,037 injured in the two quakes in northwest Iran, Press TV reported, citing the country's Health Ministry. The head of emergency services, Gholamreza Masoumi, told the semi-official Fars News Agency that 4,500 people were injured. About 1,200 were taken to hospitals, and the remaining 3,300 were treated as outpatients and released, he said. Rescue operations were reported to have ended Sunday. ""All those killed or injured in the incident have been taken out of the rubble,"" said Abolhassan Faqih, the head of Iran's Red Crescent Society, according to Fars. Scores of villages were destroyed or damaged by the quakes, which struck East Azarbaijan province northeast of Tabriz, the country's fourth-largest city. Khalil Saei, the provincial director of crisis management, told the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency that the cities of Ahar and Varzaqan were the hardest hit. The first earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.4, hit Saturday at 4:53 p.m. local time, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which said the epicenter was 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of Ahar. The agency measured 11 aftershocks. Eleven minutes later, a second quake struck. This one measured 6.3 and had an epicenter 32 kilometers (20 miles) west-southwest of Ahar. At a depth of less than 10 kilometers (6 miles), both quakes were shallow. The shaking that follows an earthquake is worse in shallow quakes. Are you there? Send your photos, videos . A series of aftershocks followed, including one measuring 4.4 magnitude, according to the USGS. Authorities had asked residents to spend the night outdoors as a safety precaution. The Red Crescent's Faqih said 230 villages in the Varzaqan, Haris and Ahar regions suffered 70% to 100% damage. ""All those under debris have been rescued, and the quake-stricken people are now being provided with their basic needs,"" Deputy Interior Minister Hassan Qaddami told Fars. He said that Russia, Turkey and Taiwan had offered help with relief and rescue operations, but that none was needed. Thousands of tents were set up throughout the stricken region, and tens of thousands of cans of food were distributed, Iranian officials said. In a statement, Catherine Ashton, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy and vice president of the European Commission, said she was ""saddened by the tragic news"" of the incident. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is prepared to offer earthquake assistance but had received no request. ""Americans wishing to provide humanitarian assistance to Iranians during this time may donate food and medicine without obtaining an Iranian transactions regulations license,"" she told reporters. ""Additionally, certain noncommercial personal financial transactions for Iran are authorized under existing general licenses."" The quakes damaged historic monuments, including the roof of Shahabeddin Ahari's tomb and the Qasem Khan Ahari house, among other sites, Press TV said. Iran sits on major fault lines -- the collision of the Arabia and Eurasia plates -- and has been prone to devastating earthquakes. Nine years ago, 30,000 people died in an earthquake in Bam in southeastern Kerman province. In 1990, about 50,000 were killed in a quake near the Caspian Sea.

"(CNN) -- Two men were arraigned Tuesday in connection with an attack on a Michigan woman who gave birth three days after being abducted, set on fire and shot in the back, police said. One of the suspects, the woman's former boyfriend, is the father of the boy born Tuesday morning, said Louis Galasso, police deputy commissioner in Warren, a Detroit suburb. The man conspired with his roommate to terminate the pregnancy, police said. ""There is not a scintilla of any mitigating events in this case,"" Galasso said. ""It is nothing more than a disturbing, diabolic scheme put together by two individuals."" The Detroit mother and baby were hospitalized Tuesday afternoon in an undisclosed location. The infant was in the intensive care unit and the woman, 22, was in stable condition, said Galasso. Police have charged Latonya Bowman's former boyfriend, Jamal Rashard Rogers, and his roommate, Antonio Valentine Mathis. Both are 22. The men Tuesday entered not guilty pleas to multiple charges, including assault with intent to murder, unlawful imprisonment and conspiracy to commit homicide. Mathis also faces a weapons charge, police said. They were denied bond and sought court-appointed attorneys. Rogers had told Bowman he wanted nothing to do with his child once it was born, according to Galasso. The conspiracy with Mathis began in March and continued as the woman entered her final stage of pregnancy, authorities said. At some point, Rogers, who is expecting a child with another woman, told Bowman he wanted to reconcile, Galasso said. A videotape taken Friday at an area Home Depot allegedly shows Mathis buying gloves, tape and rope hours before Saturday morning's incident. Police said they believe Rogers, who allegedly has two other children, drove Mathis to the Home Depot to buy the items. Several hours later, Bowman drove her SUV to Rogers' Warren residence and they went to a movie. Afterward, Rogers instructed Bowman to pull into the garage, where a gunman taped her eyes and mouth shut and bound her hands, police said. The abductor, who police believe was Mathis, drove toward Detroit with the woman. ""As they are driving he makes a reference to her pregnancy and says, 'You know why I am doing this' and asks how far along she was in her pregnancy,"" Galasso said. After the abductor stopped the vehicle, the woman was doused with lighter fluid and set on fire. ""She was able to roll out of the vehicle and tries to extinguish herself on the ground and hears two gunshots. One hits her in the upper back and she plays dead,"" Galasso said. According to police, Rogers sent pretend text messages to the woman during the abduction. Bowman told police she did not know her abductor. Rogers said he originally conspired to end the pregnancy, but changed his mind at the last moment and told Mathis to abandon the plan, said Galasso. ""We don't believe that statement to be credible."" Mathis has denied responsibility. ""There is no indication there was any monetary exchange or remediation,"" Galasso said. Bowman was able to drive to a service station and call her mother. Mohamed Zokari, an employee at the Shell station, told CNN affiliate WDIV that employees gave the woman a T-shirt when she walked in. ""Everything was bad, she was burned up,"" Zokari said.

"(CNN) -- They are always the last to understand. It's weird, isn't it, the way our greatest cheaters and liars go so far and so hard in their efforts to win and dominate and overcome that, en route, they fail to see the inevitable downfall that awaits? Back in the early 2000s, when I was a baseball writer at Sports Illustrated, Barry Bonds treated everyone âteammates, coaches, opponents, fans, writers â as if they were specks of crud beneath his (regularly manicured) fingernails. He camped out in front of a wall of four lockers, had his own clubhouse videographer, his own clubhouse physical therapist, his own perky publicists. He was the greatest home run hitter who ever lived: a slugger who, well into his late 30s, was bashing 450-foot shots over the deepest of outfield walls. Then â Balco. And Game of Shadows.  And flaxseed oil. And embarrassing testimony. Where is Barry Bonds today? Answer: Who the hell cares? His website is down. His cards can be had, straight up, in exchange for two Kirk McCaskills and a Sil Campusano. He will never be hired to work in the game, as either a broadcaster or coach. His records â in the minds of most fans â don't count. He is invisible. Worse than invisible. He is insignificant. News: Lance Armstrong banned from world Ironman events over doping probe . Which leads us to Lance Armstrong. In case you missed the news, Wednesday morning the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency filed new charges against the seven-time Tour de France winner, threatening to strip the cycling legend of his triumphs. According to the agency, blood samples taken from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 are ""fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions."" The agency also accuses Armstrong of using and promoting the use of EPO (a blood booster), blood transfusions, testosterone, HGH and anti-inflammatory steroids. In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's former teammate, said he witnessed the star using EPO on multiple occasions. Armstrong, of course, denies all the charges. I don't believe him. He says he is clean and innocent -- just as Barry Bonds was clean and innocent, just as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and Marion Jones and Shawne Merriman and every other too-good-to-possibly-be-true athletic freak was clean and innocent, too. He is a victim of the media. A victim of jealousy. A victim of haters. A victim of sport inconsistencies. Why, he's passed 350 tests and, even if the testing system is a complete joke, well, hey, he passed. Ludicrous. What Lance Armstrong is allegedly doing -- what all athletes in his shoes seem to do â is beyond damaging. Across the world, millions of people believe in Armstrong's narrative. They love his wins, yes, but what drives them and inspires them is the way he faced cancer and battled back from a near-death experience. Young children in pediatric care have been relayed his story, have been told that one day, if you stay strong and fight and believe, you, too, can be just like Lance Armstrong. Sigh. Surely, somewhere along the way, Armstrong apparently convinced himself that there was no other way. As the common athletic thinking goes: If everyone else is cheating, I need to cheat, too. That logic, now pervasive throughout all levels of sport, has turned our athletic endeavors into fraudulent clown shows. For every Bonds and McGwire and Roger Clemens, there were clean ballplayers being robbed of their greatness. I'll never forget a conversation I once had with Sal Fasano, a journeyman catcher who spent his nine-team, 11-year big league career desperately trying to hold on to a job. We were chatting about all the catchers who were named in the Mitchell Report; all the men who loaded up, then stole the positions he was battling for. ""There's an idea that everyone cheats,"" Fasano said. ""Well, I don't, and I never have. For me, it's about integrity. That's what counts."" Like Barry Bonds, Lance Armstrong is the last to know where he is headed. We are already beginning to speak of him as we do Alf and Emmanuel Lewis and Small Wonder on one of those ""I Love the '80s"" shows. We'll look back at his cycling reign and shrug, because it will be merely an illusion, an ugly period when people cheated to win, then faced a lifetime of banishment. News: Lance Armstrong responds to agency's doping allegations . We will laugh. Then we will shrug. Then â nothingness. Lance Armstrong will be invisible. As he should be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman: Great sports cheaters are always the last to anticipate their downfall .

"MURRAYVILLE, Georgia (CNN)  -- A few weeks before 13-year-old Jonathan King killed himself, he told his parents that his teachers had put him in ""time-out."" The room where Jonathan King hanged himself is shown after his death. It is no longer used, a school official said. ""We thought that meant go sit in the corner and be quiet for a few minutes,"" Tina King said, tears washing her face as she remembered the child she called ""our baby ... a good kid."" But time-out in the boy's north Georgia special education school was spent in something akin to a prison cell -- a concrete room latched from the outside, its tiny window obscured by a piece of paper. Called a seclusion room, it's where in November 2004, Jonathan hanged himself with a cord a teacher gave him to hold up his pants.  Watch Jonathan's parents on their son's death Â» . An attorney representing the school has denied any wrongdoing. Seclusion rooms, sometimes called time-out rooms, are used across the nation, generally for special needs children. Critics say that along with the death of Jonathan, many mentally disabled and autistic children have been injured or traumatized. Few states have laws on using seclusion rooms, though 24 states have written guidelines, according to a 2007 study conducted by a Clemson University researcher. Texas, which was included in that study, has stopped using seclusion and restraint. Georgia has just begun to draft guidelines, four years after Jonathan's death. Based on conversations with officials in 22 states with written guidelines, seclusion is intended as a last resort when other attempts to calm a child have failed or when a student is hurting himself or others. Michigan requires that a child held in seclusion have constant supervision from an instructor trained specifically in special education, and that confinement not exceed 15 minutes. Connecticut education spokesman Tom Murphy said ""time-out rooms"" were used sparingly and were ""usually small rooms with padding on the walls."" Only Vermont tracks how many children are kept in seclusion from year to year, though two other states, Minnesota and New Mexico, say they have been using the rooms less frequently in recent years. Dr. Veronica Garcia, New Mexico's education secretary, said her state had found more sophisticated and better ways to solve behavior problems. Garcia, whose brother is autistic, said, ""The idea of confining a child in a room repeatedly and as punishment, that's an ethics violation I would never tolerate."" But researchers say that the rooms, in some cases, are being misused and that children are suffering. Public schools in the United States are now educating more than half a million more students with disabilities than they did a decade ago, according to the National Education Association. ""Teachers aren't trained to handle that,"" said Dr. Roger Pierangelo, executive director of the National Association of Special Education Teachers. ""When you have an out-of-control student threatening your class -- it's not right and it can be very damaging -- but seclusion is used as a 'quick fix' in many cases."" Former Rhode Island special education superintendent Leslie Ryan told CNN that she thought she was helping a disabled fifth-grader by keeping him in a ""chill room"" in the basement of a public elementary school that was later deemed a fire hazard. ""All I know is I tried to help this boy, and I had very few options,"" Ryan said. After the public learned of the room, she resigned from her post with the department but remains with the school. School records do not indicate why Jonathan King was repeatedly confined to the concrete room or what, if any, positive outcome was expected. His parents say they don't recognize the boy described in records as one who liked to kick and punch his classmates. They have launched a wrongful death lawsuit against the school -- the Alpine Program in Gainesville -- which has denied any wrongdoing. A Georgia judge is expected to rule soon on whether the case can be brought before a jury. Jonathan's parents say the boy had been diagnosed since kindergarten with severe depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But his father remembers him as a boy who was happy when he sang in the church choir. ""He was a hugger, liked to go fishing with me and run after me saying, 'Daddy, when are we going to the lake?' "" Don King said. King said that he wanted to know if there were similar situations in other schools and that critics of seclusion rooms fear there could be. ""Jonathan's case is the worst of the worst, but it should be a warning. It's reasonable to think that it could happen in all the other schools that use seclusion on disabled children -- largely because the use of seclusion goes so unchecked,"" said Jane Hudson, an attorney with the National Disability Rights Network. ""This is one of those most unregulated, unresearched areas I've come across,"" said Joseph Ryan, a Clemson University special education researcher who has worked in schools for disabled kids and co-authored a study on the use of seclusion. ""You have very little oversight in schools of these rooms -- first because the general public doesn't really even know they exist,"" he said. There is no national database tracking seclusion incidents in schools, though many have been described in media reports, lawsuits, disability advocacy groups' investigations and on blogs catering to parents who say their child had been held in seclusion. Disability Rights California, a federally funded watchdog group, found that teachers dragged children into seclusion rooms they could not leave. In one case, they found a retarded 8-year-old had been locked alone in a seclusion room in a northeast California elementary school for at least 31 days in a year. ""What we found outrageous was that we went to the schools and asked to see the rooms and were denied,"" said Leslie Morrison, a psychiatric nurse and attorney who led the 2007 investigation that substantiated at least six cases of abuse involving seclusion in public schools. ""It took a lot of fighting to eventually get in to see where these children were held."" CNN asked every school official interviewed if a reporter could visit a seclusion room and was denied every time. In other instances of alleged abuse: . â¢ A Tennessee mother alleged in a federal suit against the Learn Center in Clinton that her 51-pound 9-year-old autistic son was bruised when school instructors used their body weight on his legs and torso to hold him down before putting him in a ""quiet room"" for four hours. Principal Gary Houck of the Learn Center, which serves disabled children, said lawyers have advised him not to discuss the case. â¢ Eight-year-old Isabel Loeffler, who has autism, was held down by her teachers and confined in a storage closet where she pulled out her hair and wet her pants at her Dallas County, Iowa, elementary school. Last year, a judge found that the school had violated the girl's rights. ""What we're talking about is trauma,"" said her father, Doug Loeffler. ""She spent hours in wet clothes, crying to be let out."" Waukee school district attorney Matt Novak told CNN that the school has denied any wrongdoing. â¢ A mentally retarded 14-year-old in Killeen, Texas, died from his teachers pressing on his chest in an effort to restrain him in 2001. Texas passed a law to limit both restraint and seclusion in schools because the two methods are often used together. Federal law requires that schools develop behavioral plans for students with disabilities. These plans are supposed to explicitly explain behavior problems and methods the teacher is allowed to use to stop it, including using music to calm a child or allowing a student to take a break from schoolwork. A behavioral plan for Jonathan King, provided to CNN by the Kings' attorney, shows that Jonathan was confined in the seclusion room on 15 separate days for infractions ranging from cursing and threatening other students to physically striking classmates. Howard ""Sandy"" Addis, the director of the Pioneer education agency which oversees Alpine, said that the room where Jonathan died is no longer in use. Citing the ongoing litigation, he declined to answer questions about the King case but defended the use of seclusion for ""an emergency safety situation."" The Alpine Program's attorney, Phil Hartley, said Jonathan's actions leading up to his suicide did not suggest the boy was ""serious"" about killing himself. Jonathan's actions were an ""effort to get attention,"" Hartley said. ""This is a program designed for students with severe emotional disabilities and problems,"" he said. ""It is a program which frequently deals with students who use various methods of getting attention, avoiding work."" A substitute employee placed in charge of watching the room on the day Jonathan died said in an affidavit that he had no training in the use of seclusion, and didn't know Jonathan had threatened suicide weeks earlier. The Kings say they would have removed their son from the school if they knew he was being held in seclusion, or that he had expressed a desire to hurt himself. ""We would have home schooled him or taken him to another psychologist,"" said Don King. ""If we would have known, our boy would have never been in that room. He would still be alive.""","Mentally disabled, autistic kids injured, traumatized in school seclusion rooms .

"New York (Financial Times) -- Shares in Manchester United's initial public offering were priced at $14, below the $16 to $20 price range that underwriting banks had initially set. The lower price means the football club and its owners will raise around $234m from the sale of 16.7m shares. That is nearly $100m lower than the $330m implied at the top end of the price range. It also means that the Glazer family, who have owned the club since 2005, will raise $117m gross, lower than original hopes. However, underwriters retain the option to sell an additional 2.5m shares on behalf of the ""selling shareholder"", which could raise an extra $35m. Half of the proceeds from the share sale are to be used to pay down the club's large outstanding debt. When the shares start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the symbol MANU, it will mark the biggest sports listing on record, surpassing World Wrestling Federation's $190m IPO in 1999, according to Thomson Reuters. The lower pricing came after the order book was closed at noon rather than at the conclusion of business on Thursday. The IPO in New York comes after previous attempts to list in Hong Kong and Singapore failed to attract sufficient demand. Investors also objected to the planned dual voting share structure. ""The US market for IPOs is deep in terms of liquidity and certainty of execution,"" said Scott Cutler, co-head of US listings at NYSE Euronext. He said that attracting Manchester United to the NYSE showed that the exchange occupied a strong position in the IPO market. Manchester United's dual class voting structure will enable the Glazer family to retain control through shares that have 10 times more voting power than the publicly traded class A shares. Also, the company has indicated that it may provide limited financial disclosure for US investors as it is raising capital as an ""emerging growth"" company under the recently passed US legislation Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or Jobs Act. The law means a company can be exempted from attesting to its internal financial controls and will not be required to file quarterly reports or release information under generally accepted accounting principles for five years. Manchester United added: ""We have not taken advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus, although we may choose to do so in future filings and if we do, the information that we provide shareholders may be different than you might get from other public companies in which you hold equity."" Ahead of the pricing, analysts had said the price range was too high as it implied an expensive enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of more than 20 times. ""We see good growth potential in the business ... but we believe the midpoint of the IPO valuation range overstates the economic opportunity,"" said Morningstar.

"(CNN) -- Former Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase was hospitalized Wednesday after an apparent suicide attempt that took place hours after the Supreme Court confirmed his two-year prison sentence for illegally raising campaign funds, the government said. The Public Ministry said in a news release that Nastase, 61, shot himself in the neck late Wednesday night, when a police team arrived at his residence to inform him of his arrest. He told the police to wait while he went to get books from his home library, then shot himself there, the ministry said. He was taken to Floreasca Hospital in Bucharest. ""He looks terrible,"" Prime Minister Victor Ponta told reporters after visiting Nastase in the hospital, which did not release Nastase's condition. The decision by Romania's Supreme Court is final. But Nastase's lawyer, Ioan Cazacu, said he will appeal the decision to the European Court of Human Rights. Nastase won't be allowed to run for or serve in public office for two years after he completes his prison sentence. The high court found Nastase guilty of illegally raising Ã¢âÂ¬1.6 million ($2.1 million) during his 2004 election campaign, when he ran for president on behalf of the Social Democrat Party. The conviction came after more than 1,000 days of trial and testimony from more than 900 witnesses. Nastase has had no comment on the court's decision. The case was nicknamed the Quality Trophy, a reference to a conference organized by a state construction agency in 2004 at which companies and institutions donated money that was used by Nastase to fund his campaign, prosecutors said. The trial started in January 2009, after Nastase was accused of using his political influence as a party leader in his own interest. He repeatedly denied the accusations and said the trial was a political one. He accused President Traian Basescu, who defeated Nastase in the 2004 election, of being behind the scandal. Five other people charged in the case received sentences of up to six years in prison. In a separate case, Nastase was placed on three years of probation in March after he was convicted of committing blackmail while in office. The charge had been under investigation for more than six years. Nastase was involved in another case, known as the Aunt Tamara case, in which he was accused of paying a $400,000 bribe to the former head of the country's anti-money-laundering agency to delete some documents related to his wife's bank account. Nastase was found not guilty in that case. Nastase served as Romania's premier from 2000 to 2004 and remained an important figure in his Social Democrat Party. The party took power in May, after the former government's collapse. Wednesday's decision marks the first prison sentence for a senior politician in Romania since the fall of communism in the country in 1989. The sentence marks the first important signal from Romania to the European Union that it is serious about trying to tackle corruption. The country has been criticized by Brussels in recent years for failing to enact judicial reform and to solve corruption cases involving high-profile politicians. Concern about corruption in Romania led northern European countries last year to block the country from joining the European Union's Schengen passport-free area.","NEW: Lawyer to appeal to European Court for Human Rights .

"Washington (CNN) -- Shocking as it may sound, the seemingly endless federal bureaucracy can get confusing, especially when interpreting statutory procedure. When that happens, federal courts -- including the Supreme Court -- by precedent normally give the government the benefit of the doubt, what is called ""administrative deference."" That ambiguity was on display Monday in an unusual legal dilemma: Can a child conceived after the death of the biological father be eligible for survivor benefits under Social Security? The Obama administration thinks not, and a majority of justices -- almost by default -- appeared to agree during a spirited morning of oral arguments. ""You lose if the statute is ambiguous,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts to the lawyer for the surviving parent. ""Is there any reason we shouldn't conclude based on the last hour that it's at least ambiguous?"" Added Justice Elena Kagan: ""It's a mess."" At issue is how the court should interpret the word ""child"" and whether state laws over wills and trusts are adequate to deal with evolving technology for in vitro fertilization. Robert Capato developed esophageal cancer just months after marrying Karen Kuttner in 1999. Concerned the medical treatment could leave him sterile, Capato began depositing semen in a sperm bank. After his health improved, the couple conceived naturally and a son was born. But the man's condition later worsened and Robert died in March 2002. The confusion lies in the fact his final will did not specify whether children born after his passing could be legally declared his survivors. But a separate notarized document from the Capatos stated, ""Any children born to us, who were conceived by the use of our embryos, shall in all respects and for purposes, including but not limited to descent of property, be children of our bodies."" Karen underwent the in vitro fertilization procedure and 18 months after her husband's death, twin children were born. She then applied for Social Security survivor benefits, but the agency rejected the claim. An administrative judge concluded the ""domicile at death"" for Robert, the wage earner, was Florida, and that state did not provide for children conceived after the parent's death. A federal appeals court then found for Karen Capato, saying the twins were ""children"" within meaning of state law and Social Security regulations. The agency then appealed to the Supreme Court for review. The justices clearly appeared at odds over how to treat this relatively new category of offspring, and whether they should be in the same category as stepchildren or adopted children when deciding survivor benefits. Roberts suggested ""there is no clear answer. I mean, let's take a situation where this type of reproduction is new, and the state legislatures haven't had a chance to decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for state intestacy (inheritance) law or not."" Several of his colleagues searched for related scenarios that could guide them in this unusual instance. ""Let's assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased husband's sperm to birth two children. They are the biological children of the Capatos. Would they qualify for survivor benefits even though she is now remarried?"" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ""A situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable, because I don't see the words 'biological' in the (federal) statute. I don't see the word 'marriage' directly, within the definition of 'child.'"" Justice Antonin Scalia was more direct. Federal policy ""disfavors children who are born after the father has died. Which is in accord with the title of the statute: Survivors Benefits,"" he said. ""What is at issue here is not whether children that have been born through artificial insemination get benefits. It's whether children who are born after the father's death gets benefits."" Charles Rothfeld. Capato's attorney, said, ""There is no question that children who are ... pro-conceived naturally in the marriage and are born after the father's death are deemed to be dependents and receive benefits."" Sotomayor jumped in: ""I am interested as to what your definition of child is. Is it just a biological offspring? Is it limited to a biological offspring born of a particular marriage? But in what context?"" Rothfeld struggled to respond. ""What if the Capato twins were conceived four years after of the death in this case?"" asked Roberts. ""Would your argument be the same?"" ""These children were born 18 months after the insured wage earner died,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""If we look to other categories of children -- say, stepchildren, and there is also one for adopted children -- they qualify only if they had that status no less than nine months before the wage earner died, and adopted children there is also a limitation. The stepchild and the adopted child, there could never be any question of being born 18 months later. They wouldn't qualify. There is a time limit for the other children. And if Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would put a time limit on this, too."" Rothfeld did little to convince the court that advances in artificial insemination were something lawmakers could not have anticipated when they passed the Social Security Act in 1939 and should not continue to hinder his client's ability to seek benefits. ""I think the problem is that we're dealing with new technologies that Congress didn't develop -- wasn't anticipating at the time."" A ruling by the court is expected by June, but it is not likely to have an immediate widespread impact. Court records show only about 100 other federal benefit applicants in a similar situation as Capato. But the justices could use this appeal to clarify what it means to be a ""child"" in relation to a parent and whether current state and federal law is flexible enough to incorporate a growing a range of technological conception possibilities. The case is Astrue v. Capato (11-159).","NEW: ""It's a mess,"" Kagan says .

"(CNN) -- World soccer's governing body FIFA is to examine a retired footballer's claims spot-fixing was rife in the English Premier League.

""FIFA is monitoring this issue and involved its chief investigator in England,"" read a statement from the organization. ""Once all information is known it will be decided who is leading the investigations."" Lundekvam, who played in the EPL between 1996 and 2005, said deals were done with the opposing team's captain. Will FIFA regret opening technology can of worms? ""For a while we did this almost every week,"" said the former Norway international. ""We made a fair bit of money. We could make deals with the opposing captain about. ""For example, betting on the first throw, the first corner, who started with the ball, a yellow card or a penalty. Those were the sorts of thing we had influence over. ""The results were never on the agenda. That is something I would never have done. We were professional competitors.

"(CNN) -- Mary Richardson Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had no traces of alcohol in her system when she took her own life in May, according to a toxicology report released Friday by the Westchester County medical examiner. Kennedy, who had been battling depression, was found dead May 16 in Bedford, New York, a small town north of New York City where she lived. The medical examiner's office determined Kennedy died as a result of asphyxiation due to hanging. She was 52. While no traces of alcohol were found in Kennedy's system, the medical examiner's report did find Trazodone, O-Desmethylvenlafaxine and Venlafaxine -- substances the National Institute of Health categorizes as anti-depressants. Mary Kennedy married Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 1994. The prominent environmental lawyer is the third of 11 children born to Ethel and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was gunned down in 1968. Mary Kennedy remembered for devotion . Details of the couple's private life were exposed when Robert Kennedy filed for divorce in May 2010. After that, Mary Kennedy was charged once with driving while intoxicated and once with driving while impaired by prescription drugs, according to Bedford police. ""A lot of times, I don't know how she made it through the day,"" Robert Kennedy told The New York Times. ""She was in a lot of agony for a lot of her life.""

"London (CNN) -- The dream is still alive, for the U.S. men's basketball team. The heavily favored American hoopsters -- referred to, like past Olympic squads, as the Dream Team -- used a balanced effort Friday night to defeat Argentina 109-83 and advance to Sunday's final. Kevin Durant, the reigning NBA scoring champ from the Oklahoma City Thunder, led all players with 19 points. He was followed closely by the Miami Heat's LeBron James, the three-time NBA MVP who chipped in with 18 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. The Argentina squad is no slouch, boasting NBA stalwarts Manu Ginobili, Luis Scola and Carlos Delfino. But they were no match for the U.S. team, which was ahead five points after the first quarter and steadily pulled away thereafter. They'll vie for Olympic gold Sunday against Spain, led by Pau Gasol of the Los Angeles Lakers. In their semifinal match-up Friday, Spain trailed Russia 31-20 at the half and pulled to a 46-46 tie after three quarters, then ran away with the game late to win by 67-59. The U.S. men won't be alone in trying to stand atop the Olympic podium this weekend. The American women's basketball team has already made it through to the gold-medal final, which they'll play against France on Saturday. In Olympic Stadium, meanwhile, America's top female sprinters outpaced their Jamaican competitors to earn gold in the prestigious 4 x 100-meter relay -- though their long dominant countrymen fell just short in the 4 X 400-meter men's race. The Bahamas team of Chris Brown, Demetrius Pinder, Michael Mathieu and Ramon Miller won the latter event, rallying to pass the U.S. squad, which has had a stranglehold on this relay for decades, on the final lap. Trinidad and Tobago took home bronze. The lineup for Team USA in the men's race changed after the semifinal, when Manteo Mitchell remarkably found a way to finish his opening leg after feeling his fibula breaks but continuing to run through the pain. One man who made headlines in the race, without winning, was South Africa's Oscar Pistorius. Prior to running his nation's final leg of Friday's relay final, Pistorius -- who runs on special carbon fiber prosthetic limbs and was once prevented from competing against able-bodied athletes -- had made history as the first double amputee athlete to compete in the Olympics. The United States track and field team, though, had reason to celebrate earlier when its women's 4 X 100-meter team earned gold. The U.S. quartet included Allyson Felix and Carmelita Jeter, who took gold and bronze, respectively, in the women's 200-meter run, and Tianna Madison and Bianca Knight. Together, they convincingly set a world record of 40.82, just ahead of the second-place Jamaicans, who posted a 41.41 time. Ukraine captured the bronze.

The day's first track and field gold medal went to Ethiopia's Meseret Defar, who bested Kenya's Vivian Jepkemoi Cheruiyot by less than half a second to win the women's 5,000-meter race. A short time later, Turkey's Asli Cakir Alptekin beat her fellow countrywoman Gamze Bulut and Bahrain's Maryam Yusuf Jamal to earn gold in the women's 1,500-meter final.

Gold in the men's open water 10-kilometer swimming marathon in the Serpentine, the lake in London's Hyde Park, went to Tunisian Oussama Mellouli. Germany's Thomas Lurz earned silver and Canada's Richard Weinberger the bronze. Mellouli's victory in the grueling race, in front of hundreds of spectators living the banks of the Serpentine, gave Tunisia its first gold medal of the 2012 London Games. He also took bronze in the pool last week in the men's 1,500-meter freestyle race. In men's BMX cycling, Latvia's Maris Strombergs won the gold, defending his Olympics title won at the Beijing Games. Sam Willoughby of Australia earned the silver and Carlos Oquendo Zabala of Colombia got the bronze. A Colombian, Mariana Pajon, won the gold in women's BMX cycling, with Sarah Walker of New Zealand getting the silver and Laura Smulders of the Netherlands the bronze. Winds off Weymouth, on England's south coast, remained light Friday, posing a challenge to the men and women battling for medals in sailing events. Australia's Mathew Belcher and Malcolm Page took gold in the men's 470 sailing, with the silver medal going to Great Britain and bronze to Argentina. New Zealand claimed gold and Great Britain silver in the women's 470 race, with the Dutch taking bronze. In freestyle wrestling, American Jordan Burroughs defeated Iran's Sadegh Saeed Goudarzi to earn gold in the men's 74-kilogram event. Gold in the 55-kilogram freestyle category went to Russia's Dzhamal Otarsultanov, who beat Vladimer Khinchegashvili of neighboring Georgia. In men's boxing, defending superheavyweight champion Roberto Cammarelle of Italy narrowly defeated world amateur No. 1 Magomedrasul Medzhidov, of Azerbaijan, 13-12, on points to wrap up a night of semifinal fights. He'll face Great Britain's Anthony Joshua in Sunday's gold medal bout. Ireland's John Joe Nevin and Great Britain's Luke Campbell will battle for the gold in the bantam 56-kilogram event Saturday night after winning through their respective semifinals. The Netherlands defeated world champion Argentina 2-0 to earn gold in Friday night's women's field hockey final, shortly after Great Britain topped New Zealand 3-1 to earn the bronze. The International Olympic Committee excluded Italian athlete Alex Schwazer from the London Games on Friday after he tested positive for a banned substance, recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO), which aids red blood cell production. Schwazer, 27, had been due to compete Saturday in the men's 50-kilometer race walk. Read more: Where is Australia in the Olympics?

"(CNN) -- A U.S. guided missile destroyer was involved in a collision with an oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy announced. No one on either the USS Porter or the Japanese-owned M/V Otowasan was injured, the Navy said. The 505-foot Porter is operating under its own power near the strait, a strategically important chokepoint for oil shipments from the Persian Gulf. The crew is evaluating the damage, which appeared in photos released by the military to be a large dent in the side. The Norfolk, Virginia-based ship is part of the U.S. 5th Fleet and left its home port on March 12. The Navy said the accident, which occurred Sunday at about 1 a.m. local time, was not combat-related. Navy: U.S. destroyer collides with oil tanker .

"(CNN) -- A 7-year-old Georgia girl fought off a man who'd grabbed her in the aisle of a Walmart, with police eventually tracking down the suspect they accuse of attempted kidnapping. Georgeann Baxter told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that she was in the Bremen store with her daughter, Brittney, on Wednesday. ""We were walking around the Walmart, and we felt safe,"" the mother said, talking about how they were looking at Valentine's Day cards and toys in the west Georgia store, about 45 miles west of Atlanta. When Baxter asked her daughter if she wanted to join her to get strawberries, the girl said that she wanted to stay in the toy aisle for a few more minutes. Soon thereafter, surveillance video from the Walmart -- later released by Bremen police -- shows a man approaching her. ""He came up to me and started a conversation,"" Brittney recalled Thursday to HLN. ""After ... I said, 'I'm going to get my Mommy."" The man is seen in the video picking up the young girl and starting to carry her away, as she flailed. Brittney said she responded as she'd been taught by family, including her brother in the U.S. Army, and a school counselor in a lesson on how to respond if you're touched inappropriately. ""Punch, kick and scream as hard as you can, and then tell somebody that you trust,"" she said of what she did -- and what she'd tell others to do, if they're in the same situation. Eventually, the man put the girl down and fled the store. Police later caught and arrested Thomas Woods, whom they accuse of trying to kidnap Brittney. On Thursday, Woods, in his mid-20s, insisted to reporters -- including those from CNN affiliate WSB -- that he was innocent. ""I didn't bother nobody. I was never there,"" he said. According to information from the Georgia Department of Corrections, Woods was released on parole last October after serving four and a half years of a 7-year term for voluntary manslaughter. Bremen Police Chief Keith Pesnell told HLN that he favored changing the rules, so that there were greater restrictions on people who are convicted of violent crimes -- to prevent incidents like the one that allegedly happened to Brittney. ""I think it's time we have to look at things, for the safety of the children,"" Pesnell said. ""Fortunately, things are in place to train our kids, and Brittney did exactly the right thing."" Speaking to HLN's Vinnie Politan, Emily Altman -- a counselor at the Tallapoosa Primary School -- said that she'd taught Brittney and other students as young as four years old some self-defense basics as part of a program called ""Good Touch, Bad Touch."" ""It's never too early to say, you stay right with mom, or you yell and scream if somebody were to (grab you),"" Altman said of the program. However she learned what to do, young Brittney responded ""perfectly"" to the alleged kidnapper, her counselor said. ""I couldn't be prouder or her,"" Altman said.","Video from a Georgia Walmart shows a man grabbing a young girl .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy appointed three new commanders Tuesday, just days after he shook up the country's powerful military leadership. He tapped leaders to head the navy, the air force and the air defense force, Morsy spokesman Yasser Ali announced on state TV. The president sent the previous leaders into ""retirement"" on Sunday, alongside Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and Lt. Gen. Sami Anan, once the country's top military rulers. Morsy appointed Staff Maj. Gen. Abdel-Monen Bayoumi al-Terras as head of the air defense force, Staff Vice-Marshal Younes Elsayed Hamed as commander of the air force, and Staff Rear Adm. Osama Ahmed el-Gendy as head of the navy, Ali said. The fact the announcement came from Morsy directly, and not his defense minister, suggested the president is determined to take control of the military, which has been a mainstay of Egyptian politics for the past 60 years. Morsy assumed office June 30 and has moved quickly to assert his authority. Is Morsy making himself an emperor? Also Tuesday, the president honored Tantawi, presenting him with the country's top state medal, the Order of the Nile. Anan received the distinguished Order of the Republic medal later in the day. Both men have been named as advisers to Morsy, the country's first freely elected president. No details of the new posts have been announced. Tricky game of power . Meanwhile, Egyptian forces continue to battle militants in the Sinai Peninsula, the state-run al-Ahram newspaper reported, citing security sources. One soldier was wounded and one militant was captured in the clashes, the sources said. Source: Yemen forces attack Defense Ministry . The military campaign was launched after an attack at a border post last week that left more than a dozen troops dead. Morsy dismissed several security officials and the governor of northern Sinai province in the wake of the attack.","Egyptian president names navy, air force and air defense force commanders .

"(EW.com) -- EW has confirmed that ""American Idol"" winner Phillip Phillips underwent a six and a half hour surgery yesterday to remove several kidney stones, which TMZ (who first reported the news) says ""were so huge there was no chance he could've passed them on his own."" Phillips' longtime kidney issues plagued his run on ""Idol,"" causing him excruciating pain and preventing him from participating in various ""Idol"" duties, like the weekly Ford music video shoots. ""The surgery went well,"" says a source close to the show. ""He's doing well and looking forward to starting the Idol tour in July."" (The ""Idols Live"" tour kicks off July 6 in Detroit.) The surgery is the latest beat in a medical drama that's been brewing for months. In March, Phillips, who suffers a congenital kidney condition, underwent a surgical procedure to have a stent implanted into his kidney to prevent blockage -- thereby assuring he could remain a competing contestant. In April, Phillips' father, Donnie, told Albany Uncovered that ""contestants are getting very little sleep and it's starting to take a toll on Phillip, especially when combined with his ongoing kidney stone issues."" Phillips' mother, Sheryl, went on to request prayers for her son on Facebook: . ""I have a special prayer request. Please stop and pray a special prayer for Phillip. He is in a lot of pain and I am sad about it. I just wish he felt good. I love him so much and wish I could be with him. He would appreciate the prayers too!"" Phillips was reportedly scheduled to go under the knife last week, but due to a fever and sinus infection, the surgery had to be delayed. (Geez, the guy just can't catch a break health-wise, can he?)

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- At least 250 people were killed and 2,000 others injured when two strong earthquakes jolted northwestern Iran on Saturday near the city of Tabriz, state-run news agencies said. Iran's state-run Press TV said 250 people had died. Officials feared the casualties would rise. The city of Ahar was home to 45 of the deaths and 500 of the injured, a local official told state-run IRNA media. The first earthquake, a magnitude 6.4, hit at 4:53 p.m. local time 37 miles northeast of Tabriz, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which measured 11 aftershocks. Just 11 minutes later a second quake, measuring 6.3, struck 30 miles northeast of Tabriz. Authorities reported 17 aftershocks in the region, state-run IRNA media said. The semi-official Fars News Agency reported 35 aftershocks. Officials asked residents, as a safety precaution, to spend the night outdoors. The quakes affected Tabriz, the capital of East Azarbaijan province, and nearby cities. It razed four villages and another 60 villages sustained heavy damage, said Fars. It said 40 people died in the city of Varzaqan and 50 were killed in Haris. Initial reports said some buildings in Tabriz suffered structural damage and power lines were down. Telephone lines were down in Ahar, the quake's epicenter. The extent of the damage was still being assessed. Many people were in dire need of drinking water, bread and shelter, said Fars, quoting officials. Authorities dispatched rescue teams to the area. Press TV broadcast images of collapsed buildings and makeshift medical stations set up in the streets. In scenes broadcast by state-run IRINN, people lying on blankets were administered intravenous fluids. Iran sits on major fault lines -- the collision of the Arabia and Eurasia plates -- and has been prone to devastating earthquakes. In 2003, 30,000 people died in an earthquake in Bam in southeastern Kerman province. In 1990, about 50,000 were killed in a quake that hit near the Caspian Sea.

"New York (CNN) -- A woman who stole an infant from a Manhattan hospital in 1987 pleaded guilty to a federal kidnapping charge Friday and could face at least 20 years behind bars. Ann Pettway has been charged in the abduction of Carlina Renae White, now in her early 20s, who was reunited with her biological mother last year. Pettway pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping charge last year. Who would steal a baby, and why? Carlina White was 19 days old when her mother took her to the Harlem hospital with a fever more than two decades ago. The mother, Joy White, testified that she went home to rest and returned to the hospital to find her baby missing. ""Ann Pettway preyed on me,"" Joy White said Friday, adding that she remembered seeing Pettway at the hospital. ""All I want is justice,"" White said. ""This is too much for me and my family."" The grand jury said Pettway had ""willfully and knowingly"" seized the baby. She turned herself in last month at the FBI office in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Report: Pettway frustrated with miscarriages . ""I raised her as my own and I knew it was wrong,"" Pettway said Friday. The younger White, who was raised under a different name, long had a nagging feeling that she was brought up by a family she did not belong to, Ernie Allen of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has said.

"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) -- Firefighters reported more advances Monday against the Waldo Canyon wildfire, saying they've stopped the fire's growth and are working on putting out hot spots within its charred 17,920-acre footprint. ""It has not moved. Perimeter growth: nothing,"" incident commander Rich Harvey said Monday. ""Now we're into the mop-up mode."" It was hopeful news for the 3,000 residents who remained under mandatory evacuation orders Monday. The focus is on getting people back into their homes as soon as possible, said Steve Cox, who is with Colorado Springs Mayor Steve Bach's office. ""In some cases, we're talking days, not weeks,"" he said. Evacuation orders for all except the hardest hit areas were lifted by late Sunday for most of the 32,000 residents who were forced from their homes after winds last week whipped the blaze that has been described as the most destructive in state history. The fire killed two people, destroyed nearly 350 homes and damaged dozens more. Photos: Wildfire photographer Kari Greer goes inside the inferno . The U.S. Forest Service has warned it could be mid-July before the fire is fully under control. As of Monday evening, the fire was 70% contained. The blaze is one of several Western wildfires that have burned hundreds of thousands of acres in Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and South Dakota -- where authorities said a U.S. Air Force C-130 assisting in the firefighting effort crashed Sunday night. The aircraft crashed while fighting the White Draw Fire near Edgemont, South Dakota, the U.S. Northern Command said. No information was available about the crew. The crash prompted the U.S. Air Force to ground all firefighting equipped C-130 planes. Including the one went down, eight such military planes had been deployed since June 24 to fight wildfires in the Rocky Mountain region -- including in Colorado to combat the Waldo Canyon Fire -- and thus are affected by the order, said National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones. While hopes were high for further advances, fire crews were mindful of the possibility of erratic gusty winds that could cause a sudden and unpredictable outbreak, incident commander Rich Harvey told reporters. While crews work to put the fire out for good, investigators are scouring the burned-out landscape for clues to what started the now 17,920-acre fire. The FBI has joined agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as well as local authorities to investigate the cause of the fire that began in the early afternoon of June 23 in the Pike National Forest, about three miles west of Colorado Springs. Federal agents joined the investigation after reports emerged that an arsonist possibly started the wildfire, which has cost more than $11 million to date to fight. Investigators had not yet come to any conclusions, Lt. Jeff Kramer of the El Paso County Sheriff's Office said Monday. With most of the evacuation orders lifted, a steady stream of motorists made their way on ash-covered roads to their homes late Sunday. ""We'd ask that (residents return) in an orderly fashion,"" said Cox, an assistant to the Colorado Springs mayor. ""Our strategy will be that we continue to shrink that focus area down and down, and get people back in their homes as soon as we can."" District Attorney Dan May warned would-be looters that he intends to deal harshly with anyone who tries to loot evacuated homes, promising potential prison sentences of more than two decades for each break-in. A map released by Colorado Springs officials showed the fire's fury as it hopscotched through neighborhoods, burning some houses, damaging others and, inexplicably, skipping over some. Lists of addresses put out by local officials spelled out the toll with simple descriptions: ""no visible damage,"" ""visible damage"" and ""total loss."" On streets with names that reflect the city's serene surroundings, Majestic Drive and Mirror Lake Court, the toll was unimaginable with nearly every house damaged or destroyed. 'Great day' as evacuations lifted; fight continues against Colorado fire . Some returned Sunday temporarily to these streets to survey the damage. Among them was Susan Solich, who is caring for her four young grandsons after their parents died last year. She drove onto the street in the Mountain Shadows area where she'd lived for 18 years to find some trees and homes still standing, but not hers. ""I've seen pictures, but it didn't really impact me the way it did, turning into my driveway,"" Solich told CNN on Sunday. ""My home was gone; it was imploded into the ground."" Sallie Clark, El Paso County commissioner, said several organizations are working together to help those rebuild their lives, including assembling records. Solich said members of her family won't leave Colorado but they're not necessarily putting down roots again in Colorado Springs either. Her focus for now is taking care of the children and making it through each day. ""It won't be quite the same. It's kind of like the Twilight Zone,"" she said. ""So many of our friends are gone, and they won't be back."" Ted and Kate Stefani, meanwhile, vowed to return and rebuild. Video they shot showed a giant hole where their home once stood. All that remained was one stray column from near their front door plus a charred seat from which they'd first spotted flames in the distance. ""We're going to rebuild there. We love that block, we just love that community. ... And it's our home,"" Ted Stefani said. All told, 52 active fires across the country have claimed 901,215 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far in 2012, the agency has tracked 27,176 fires that have burned nearly 1.9 million acres, the agency said. In 2011, when wildfires raged across much of Texas, 35,574 fires burned 4.7 million acres, according to the agency. Colorado fire victim films her evacuation .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy shook up the country's powerful military leadership Sunday, replacing top generals and reasserting power the military claimed for itself before he took office. Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, the defense minister who took power after the 2011 ouster of longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak, was given a top medal and ""sent to retirement,"" Morsy spokesman Yasser Ali announced Sunday evening on state-run Nile Television. So was Lt. Gen. Sami Anan, the chief of staff of the armed forces. Both men were named as advisers to Morsy, the country's first freely elected president, but no details of the new posts were announced. The commanders of Egypt's navy, air force and air defense force were sent into retirement as well, Ali said. Speaking Sunday night at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Morsy addressed the shakeup, saying it was meant to move the nation forward. ""The decisions that were made today were not directed at certain people, and I didn't mean to embarrass institutions. My goal is not to narrow down the freedom of those who were created free by God,"" the president said. Addressing his comments to members of the armed forces, Morsy added: ""I only want the best for them. I want for them to focus on a mission that is holy for all of us, which is protecting the homeland."" The announcement comes a little over a month after the president and the generals butted heads over Morsy's attempt to recall the country's disbanded parliament. Analysts called the moves a sign of a major shift in the balance of power between civilian leaders and the military, the backbone of the modern Egyptian state. ""This is the first time in Egypt's political history that an elected civilian politician overrules the decisions of the heads of the military establishment,"" said Omar Ashour, a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution's Doha Center. Source: Egyptian forces raid Sinai militants . Prime Minister Hesham Kandil said Morsy ""adheres to the legal procedures and the constitution in his decision."" Morsy ""recognizes Field Marshal Tantawi's hard work in the transitional phase and his efforts in leading Egypt to safety during the revolution,"" but ""His expertise will be of higher value as an adviser to the president."" Morsy promoted Maj. Gen. Abdul Fatah Khalil al-Sisi, the head of military intelligence, to defense minister and head of Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, with the rank of field marshal, Nile TV said. He also named Mahmoud Mekki as his vice president, and he reversed a June constitutional decree by the Supreme Council that claimed to retain legislative authority until a new parliament could be sworn in near the end of the year, Ali said. Egyptian president visits troubled border area . Morsy's Freedom and Justice party, the political wing of the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood, called for supporters to rally in support of the moves Sunday night in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the revolt against Mubarak. The steps announced Sunday come as Egyptian forces are battling militants in the Sinai Peninsula blamed for an attack that killed more than a dozen troops at a border post last week. They follow an abortive July attempt by Morsy to recall the parliament that the generals ordered dissolved in late June, a challenge to military authority that was halted by Egypt's highest court. Morsy assumed office June 30 and moved quickly to assert his authority, attempting to call back into session lawmakers whose elections had been thrown out by a June decision from Egypt's Constitutional Court. Egypt launches airstrikes in Sinai after troop massacre . In the aftermath of the court decision, the generals announced they would retain the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new parliament was elected under a new constitution. Under the military council's decree, Egypt's new constitution must be drawn up within three months. Morsy's bid faltered when the Constitutional Court declared that its ruling was final. Rabab Elmahdi, a professor of political science at American University in Cairo, said Morsy was pushed into Sunday's shakeup by resistance ""from the military establishment, from the old regime."" Egypt's president condemns deadly attack in Sinai . ""I think what we're seeing is a changing balance of power on the ground,"" Elmahdi said. ""The legitimacy of the first elected president in Egyptian history is something we cannot take lightly, and I think Morsy was sort of forced to make use of this kind of legitimacy."" Meanwhile, the military establishment, which has dominated the Egyptian state since 1952, doesn't want to rule directly, she said. ""They have much more complicated interests -- economic interests and political interests to keep the institution intact,"" Elmahdi said.

"Camden, Maine (CNN) -- There are no rock stars at PopTech, no household names. But this annual conference in coastal Maine is a hub for super-smart people, a chance to get a look into ideas and technologies that soon will change the world. Here's a quick look at five of them, chosen from many. You can see the full list of PopTech presenters and fellows on the group's website. Daniel Kish, 'real-life batman' Kish, who founded World Access for the Blind, sees the world with his ears. A self-described ""batman,"" Kish, who is blind, makes clicking sounds with his tongue when he walks the streets or goes hiking in the woods. He listens for those sounds to bounce off the objects around him, and uses that data to construct a mental image of the scene. He has taught these methods of human echolocation to about 500 students on several continents. With his help, these blind students have learned to ride bikes through obstacle courses, skateboard and, perhaps most importantly, achieve greater independence. ""You're basically querying the environment -- you're interrogating the environment,"" he said. ""You're asking who are you and what are you, and the environment answers back."" Adrien Treuille, game designer . For most people, gaming is a form of entertainment or escape. For Treuille, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, games can help solve real-world problems. Treuille is the creator of FoldIt, a computer game that has helped solve long-standing puzzles about protein folding. The work of FoldIt is even helping to enhance science's understanding of HIV. His new game, called EteRNA, does the same thing for RNA sequencing. Most important about these games, he says, is the fact that they're fun. And by having fun, gamers also are helping improve the world. Dominic Muren, advocate for 'maker' culture . If you live in the Western world, chances are you can't make much of anything. If you want a shirt, you buy it. If you want an Internet connection, you buy a router. No one knows much about these processes -- well, no one except ""makers"" like Dominic Muren, who is creating a website to connect people who make things in the developing world with other people on the Internet who might be able to help. The site, called alchematter.com, is expected to launch next summer. It will be yet another portal into a growing trend: People want to know where things come from and how they're produced. Increasingly, people like Muren just want to make things for themselves. He grows plants in his yard in Washington that he spins into shirts and sweaters. He hopes his website will support projects like one by Amy Sun at a group called FabFolk, which, among other things, helped makers in Afghanistan create a localized version of the Internet in their hometown. Iain D. Couzin, the locust whisperer . Why do fish swim in schools? Why do locusts fly in swarms? Couzin, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University, is trying to understand how and why organisms function as a collective rather than individuals. He's using new and innovative methods, from computer vision to Xbox Kinect cameras, to get at the answers. (It turns out, for example, that locusts swam not because they love flying in giant clumps, but because they're trying to eat each other -- and avoid being eaten by the locusts hot on their tails.) There are practical applications to this work. One of Couzin's long-term goals, for example, is to understand locusts well enough to be able to predict their swarming patterns. That may sound like no big deal if you're sitting in an American city and haven't seen a locust swarm this week -- or ever. But in lots of places, including Africa, locust swarms severely impact people's livelihoods. Forecasts could help. Aidan Dwyer, 13-year-old solar scientist . Who knows what you were doing at age 13, but I'm guessing you weren't walking through the woods, looking at trees and noticing how the spiraling pattern of the branches follow a mathematical construct called the Fibonacci sequence. Dwyer was. For a school science project, this 13-year-old used these observations to design a new type of solar panel array that's based on Fibonacci and the structure of trees. The prototype looks like a tree with little solar panels at the tips of the branches. He says it catches more light and produces about 20% more electricity than traditional solar panel arrangements. The discovery earned him a Young Naturalist Award this year from the American Museum of Natural History; and it got him plenty of high praise at PopTech, with plenty of decades-older university types expressing awe at his work.","PopTech is a yearly conference that focuses on tech and social change .

"(CNN) -- Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt has told CNN he can set a new 100 meter world record at the London 2012 Olympic Games -- and could run as fast as 9.4 seconds. Bolt took the 100m gold medal at Beijing 2008 in a world-record time of 9.69s, before bettering that mark one year later with a stunning 9.58 at the World Championships in Berlin. The 25-year-old, who is also the record-holding world and Olympic champion over 200m, is confident he can become the first man to smash the 9.4 barrier in the British capital in August. ""After my trials leading up to the Olympics, then it depends on where my fitness is,"" he said. ""If everything goes well, I can determine, how fast I think I can go. ""Everybody has been talking about this 9.4 all season. If it's possible, I'll be the one to run 9.4 seconds."" Bolt was talking to CNN Olympic contributor Linford Christie, a 100m gold medalist at the Barcelona Games in 1992, after recording 9.76 in Rome on Thursday -- the fastest time this year. Bolt named IAAF male athlete of the year after world championships double . The Kingston native's electric performances and exuberant personality have made him a global celebrity, with his ""lightning bolt"" pose now recognized all over the world. ""I think it was God sent,"" said Bolt when asked about the iconic stance. ""But it was slightly originated from an archery pose. ""I just copied it and made it my own and it worked. It's catchy and I'm like the Michael Jordan of track and field really!"" Bolt's charisma on the starting blocks sets him apart from previous generations of sprinters, who would take a far more serious approach to race preparations. He revealed how an encounter with U.S. sprinter Justin Gatlin, who served a four-year doping ban between 2006 and 2010, influenced his approach to racing. ""For me it never happened until Justin Gatlin,"" he said. ""I ran once with him in Zagreb, he did something which was really funny to me. ""We were walking back and forward and he actually spat across my lane. And when he did it, I knew he was trying to intimidate me and I found it really funny. ""Today it doesn't really bother me. I just go there, enjoy myself and relax. It's just one of those things where over the years the game has changed."" Bolt suffered a setback at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, when a false start in the 100m final allowed his compatriot Yohan Blake to claim the gold medal. Human to Hero: Champion Blake bids to steal Bolt's sprint swag . In London, Bolt will once again face competition from Blake as well as longtime rival Tyson Gay of the United States -- the 100m world champion in 2007. Can Bolt be beaten? Gay's golden Olympic goal . Despite fierce competition, Bolt insists he will be focused on his own race if he reaches the London 2012 final on August 5. ""I can't really say who's going to be my main rival but for me the main thing is the seven guys in the lanes beside me,"" he said. ""You never know what can happen on the day so I'm really focused and I'm not really worried about one thing or one person."" Christie believes Bolt can be challenged at the forthcoming Games, but his rivals with have to be confident if they are to capture his crown. Gold medal formula: Mind over matter? ""There's always a challenge,"" the Briton told CNN. ""It's whether they believe enough to challenge him. Does a challenge mean beating him? That's tough."" When asked about the biggest threats to Bolt's dominance, Christie highlighted the American duo of Gay and Gatlin as the men most likely to mount a serious challenge. ""We don't know what Justin Gatlin is capable of, Tyson Gay hasn't competed yet. We also need to wait until after the Jamaican trials."" Christie said the impact Bolt has had on athletics is similar to that of American legend Michael Johnson, a world and Olympic champion over 200m and 400m, while also comparing him to other sporting icons. ""Not meaning it in a horrible way, but he's one of the freaks in our sport. Michael Johnson came along and everybody thought 'wow.' ""Muhammad Ali was a freak in his sport, now we've got Bolt. Every so many years, someone like that comes along. Pele, Maradona, it's one of those things.""","Usain Bolt tells CNN he can break 100m world record at London 2012 .

"(CNN) -- When author and psychotherapist Bryan Robinson used to make his annual trek to the South Carolina shore with his family and friends, he'd be sure to pack more than sunscreen and swim trunks. ""I used to always take work,"" says Robinson, author of ""Chained to the Desk: A Guidebook for Workaholics, Their Partners and Children and the Clinicians Who Treat Them."" Robinson recalls his partner would search their luggage for telltale signs that he was smuggling work along on their vacation. But Robinson was careful to conceal tightly folded papers containing work notes in the pockets of his jeans, where they remained hidden. Quiz: Are you a workaholic? At the beach, when family and friends suggested a walk on the sand or a swim, Robinson would feign exhaustion and pretend to lie down for a nap. ""I would work furiously while they were gone and then pretend to sleep (when they returned),"" he says. Why is America the 'no-vacation nation'? Robinson says there's a distinct difference between a hard worker and a workaholic. A workaholic may seem happy on the outside, but underneath they're driven by anxiety and fear. ""The workaholic is on the ski slopes screaming about how he needs to get back to work, while the healthy worker is at work dreaming of being out on the ski slopes,"" he says. Robinson's vacation subterfuge is common behavior for true workaholics. ""It seemed perfectly normal and essential,"" he says of his inability to leave work unattended while on vacation. ""That's the desperation: You feel like you can never catch up. One of the things that you know is that work is a distraction, it gives you a sense of calm, helps you stay focused, but as soon as you finish a project, there's that sense of getting out of control."" For Robinson, a vacation away from work made him feel powerless and overwhelmed. And some studies suggest many Americans may feel similarly tethered to their cubicles. According to a 2009 Vacation Deprivation Survey by expedia.com, 34% of employed Americans don't use all of their annual vacation days, and 19% reported they postponed or canceled vacation for work-related reasons. A recent survey by Reuters/Ipsos found that 57% of U.S. workers use all the vacation days they're entitled to. For those of us who do break free from the confines of their cubicles long enough to dip their toes in warm waters or relax away from the office, many can't seem to leave work behind. Expedia.com reports that 30% of vacationing workers feel work-related stress while on vacation. ""Companies should be very wary of the collateral damage that workaholics can inflict on their co-workers,"" says Craig Chappelow, a senior faculty member at the Center for Creative Leadership, a nonprofit institution that specializes in leadership education and research. Chappelow says work-addicted employees can create wear and tear with their hard-driven attitudes and expectations. It's a behavior that companies must address before the workaholic burns out himself or creates too much friction with other employees. ""It's hard because (workaholic tendencies) are rewarded in lower to mid-management levels, but at the executive level, that same work ethic becomes a disadvantage,"" says Chappelow, who explains that workaholics tend to get away with their over-the-top behaviors as long as the people they affect directly work below them. At the executive level, workaholics find themselves in tough company. Now, their obsessive behaviors may affect peers who don't like being bullied. Companies that want to create a better life/work balance should employ executives who model the behavior they'd like to see in their middle and lower management workers, Chappelow says. ""I don't care much about written policies,"" says Chappelow. ""(Effective leaders) take all their vacation time, and when they're on vacation they cut the cord."" Senior managers should be wary of handing out promotions, bonuses and verbal praise to work addicted employees unless their goal is to foster an office environment wrought with fear and frustration. ""I've had patients who are afraid to take their lunch break -- let alone a vacation -- for fear that someone is angling for their jobs,"" says Robinson. ""They fear that they won't be seen as team players."" Robinson, who sought help for his work addiction after almost losing his family and friends, now counsels people who battle work addiction. He says some of his clients say it's not worth taking vacation because the act of preparing to leave is overwhelming. Others say they feel shadowed by their work as ubiquitous technology like e-mail, instant messaging, texting and Wi-Fi keeps the job just a few clicks away. Robinson says workaholics who seek treatment are challenged to set boundaries in their lives that allow them to slowly reclaim a balanced life. In the end, workaholics often confront major crisis in their lives -- either mental or physical -- before they seek help for their addiction. For Drew (last name withheld to protect identity), an entrepreneur who had been working an intense cycle of 20-hour days for nearly eight months, a mental breakdown was the wake-up call he needed to seek help. ""My behavior was outrageous, but I just couldn't see it,"" he recalls. ""Workaholics see themselves as indispensable and sometimes that's true."" ""Many do rise in the corporate culture, but you have to choose if you want to live or if you want to work,"" he added. Drew sought treatment for his addiction and found help in Workaholics Anonymous, a 12-step program that has between 5,000 and 6,000 members nationwide. ""I started using the 12 steps and bringing more balance to my life,"" says Drew. ""I started looking inside and found that I was the problem. Self-honesty helps me make much better choices,"" he says.","Workaholics are driven by anxiety and fear .

"(CNN) -- Brazil cruised into the quarterfinals of the men's Olympic football tournament with a 100% record, despite having a man sent off in Wednesday's 3-0 win against New Zealand. The South Americans, five-time world champions but seeking a first gold medal at the Games, topped Group C with three victories ahead of second-placed Egypt. Striker Leandro Damiao set up midfielder Danilo for the first goal in Newcastle and then scored his second goal of the tournament, before midfielder Sandro sealed it seven minutes after halftime. Brazil, bronze medallists in 2008, ended the match with 10 men after Alex Sandro received his second booking with 15 minutes left. Next up will be Honduras, who went through in second place from Group D following a 0-0 draw with Japan -- who finished top and will next face Egypt. Will Brazil finally win Olympic gold? European champions Spain managed a first point but still finished bottom after drawing 1-1 with Morocco. Egypt ended Belarus' hopes of a place in the last eight with a 3-1 victory, as the Pharaohs bounced back from the earlier draw with New Zealand. Needing a win to go through, Mohamed Salah, Marwan Mohsen and Mohamed Aboutrika scored in the second half before substitute Andrei Voronkov headed a late consolation. Hosts Great Britain will take on South Korea after finishing top in Group A thanks to a 1-0 win over Uruguay. Needing just a draw to go through, a goal from Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge ended the South American champions' participation. Senegal took second place in Group A following a 1-1 draw against United Arab Emirates. Striker Moussa Konate scored his fourth goal of the tournament with a header just after halftime to ensure a quarterfinal clash against Mexico, with Ismail Matar having netted in the first period for UAE.

"(CNN) -- A Louisiana charter school is changing a policy that required pregnant students to be removed from class and home-schooled, pending board approval, a school official said Thursday. ""The school has not eliminated its pregnancy policy at this time,"" said Chris Broussard, a spokesman for the Delhi Charter School. The details of the revision -- which would take effect after the school board weighs in and approves -- are not yet clear. Broussard said the law firm Davenport, Files and Kelly helped revise the policy to make it compliant with federal law, after it came under intense criticism from rights groups. Under the school's current policy, posted on its website, ""The school reserves the right to require any female student to take a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not the suspected student is in fact pregnant."" In cases where a test determines that one of the school's approximately 700 students is pregnant, ""the student will not be permitted to attend classes on the campus of Delhi Charter School."" Any student suspected of being pregnant who refuses to submit to a pregnancy test ""shall be treated as a pregnant student and will be offered home study opportunities. If home study opportunities are not acceptable, the student will be counseled to seek other educational opportunities,"" it said. In a letter sent to school officials, American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Marjorie R. Esman said the policy ""is based on the archaic and pernicious stereotype that a girl's pregnancy sets a 'bad example' for her peers -- i.e., that in having engaged in sexual activity, she has transgressed acceptable norms of feminine behavior."" News that the policy would be reviewed was welcomed by Louise Melling, director of the ACLU Center for Liberty, who described the policy as ""reminiscent of the '50s."" August 15 is the first day of class.","""The school has not eliminated its pregnancy policy at this time,"" said a school spokesman .

Departures.com: Top bath products at luxury hotels . In a city that sees 48.8 million visitors each year, the best way to claim a corner of one's own may be to hide it behind a secret phone booth, underneath a pizza stand, beyond the kitchen, on the other side of the wine cellar or in a train car. The same is true in other cities, of course, which is why digging for insider tips and word-of-mouth directions before a trip always pays off. The legwork is far more fun when the results are guaranteed. Take, for example, La Petite Cuisine Ã  Paris.

"(CNN) -- It's been impossible to go online or turn on a TV Monday without seeing all the breathless chatter about the ""Doomsday"" for the Internet, when hundreds of thousands of people were expected to abruptly lose their connection to the world's computer brain. But what caused the ""Malware Monday"" panic, and is it really warranted? Here's a quick-and-dirty guide to what's going on: . Is my computer affected? Before we actually get into what's happening, go to this site: http://www.dns-ok.us/. It will tell you, with near certainty, whether your computer (or smartphone or whatever) has been compromised by the DNSChanger malware, which is the thing everyone's talking about. iReport: How has the Internet changed your life? How did all of this start? In November, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation charged seven people in connection with a ""massive and sophisticated Internet fraud scheme"" called Operation Ghost Click. That scam tampered with the way computers access the Web by sending Internet traffic to websites that people didn't intend to visit. The group made money -- $14 million, according to the FBI -- off of fraudulent advertisements on those websites. The FBI eventually shut down the computers that were used to reroute Internet traffic. That move would have essentially cut access to the Internet for those people who had the DNSChanger malware on their systems. So, as a backup, the FBI turned on its own computers to make sure infected machines still would have Internet access. So, what happened on Monday? On Monday, the FBI turned off those backup computer servers. That means machines infected with the DNSChanger malware -- or that have traces of that malicious computer program left on their computers -- no longer can access the Internet as expected. How many people are affected? About 211,000 machines -- only 42,000 of them in the United States -- were infected Monday, according to CNNMoney. Maybe that sounds like a lot. But, at its peak, 4 million computers were ""hijacked"" by the malware, according to the FBI. That's 19 times the number of computers currently infected. ""That's a large number, but it's a very small subset of the 1.6 billion PCs worldwide, of which an estimated 339 million are in the United States,"" CNNMoney writes. Education campaigns are thought to have accounted for the difference. Google, Facebook and the U.S. government have created tools to help people notice if their machines have the DNSChanger malware. What should you do if you're infected? Go to this website and follow the steps listed (assuming you can access it): http://www.dcwg.org/fix/ . Or contact your Internet service providers and seek help. Tell them you believe that your computer has been infected with the DNSChanger malware. To prevent future infections, it's important to install updates to your machine. Professionals also recommend anti-virus software that can detect infections.","FBI turns off computer servers that prop up people infected with a piece of malware .

"(CNN) -- My prized Penn State sweatshirt sits stuffed in the back of my closet. The oversized ""We Are Penn State"" license plate that once perched above the door of my ESPN office, has been put away, along with photos of me as a proud, smiling cheerleader for the Nittany Lions. And weeks ago when my son received his very first college acceptance letter from my alma mater, Penn State -- a moment I thought would be one of the pinnacles in my life -- we both tossed the letter aside and prayed that he'd get accepted into a ""better school."" (Our prayers were answered.) I have Jerry Sandusky to thank for this change of heart. Reaction to the Sandusky verdict . Friday night, Sandusky Ã¢â¬â the former Penn State assistant football coach -- was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts related to sexual abuse of boys over a 15-year period. The jury took just two days to untangle this horrendous story and make a decision. And though some felt Sandusky would walk, I could not imagine how 12 jurors could listen to the courageous, heartbreaking testimony of all of those victims and believe that it was all a conspiracy, that those young men had all lied about the abuse charges just so they could file civil suits against an innocent Sandusky, as his defense lawyer claimed. Seeing this unimaginable story unfold for months has altered my perspective on sports forever. I've worked as a sports journalist for more than 15 years, but through all the steroid stories, the accounts of domestic abuse, the gambling and corruption cases, I never lost my joy for sports -- football coming first in my world order. Then Jerry Sandusky happened and I felt sick. Joe Paterno died and I felt heartbroken and betrayed. Clearly, none of my emotions can ever compare to the pain and loss of innocence of Sandusky's victims and their families. But this story has taken away my unabashed enthusiasm as a sports fan. Maybe it's because I'm the mother of an athlete. Or that I attended Penn State and knew many of the people involved in the story. And, like so many others, I can now look back and realize that something was a little creepy about the vibe around the Second Mile program and coach Sandusky. Jury finds Jerry Sandusky guilty on dozens of child sex abuse charges . Penn State's standout linebacker LaVar Arrington played for Sandusky. Arrington, who was mentioned many times in the trial by Victim Number 4, recalled in a column for Washingtonpost.com that he knew Victim Number 4 well, and that the young man always seemed ""mad and distant."" ""My preconceived notion was that he was part of Sandusky's Second Mile foundation, so he must live in a troubled home, and I chalked it up to that,"" Arrington wrote. ""I would just tell him to smile every once in a while or laugh, that it would make him feel better. ... It's mind-blowing to realize that a kid I took an active interest in during my time at school was suffering right in front of me and I had no idea that the pain allegedly came from someone in my own football program,"" said Arrington. LaVar is one of the most decent athletes I have had the pleasure of working with. And I share some of his guilt. I've seen the world of sports up close and have always known about stories like Sandusky. Mostly, those stories are treated as one-time events by wayward coaches, or viewed as one sports program gone wrong. We in the media never stay on these investigative stories for long. And reporters have a very difficult time pitching abuse stories to an editor. Though most sports journalists will never admit this, the main goal in sports reporting is to celebrate and illuminate the games. Constantly uncovering ugly issues in sports does not make a sports reporter a superstar at the office. Sports media are just too close to the games financially and socially to fully examine the depths of sports culture. Since Sandusky, each time I go to a game -- college, pro or high school - I can't help but wonder if any of those young men have ever been abused by a coach. At least one study indicates that one out of every six boys is sexually abused by the age of 14, a shocking statistic. Recently, I watched with happiness as LeBron and D-Wade won their first NBA Championship together. But I couldn't help but wonder if they, or their teammates, had ever been preyed upon by a coach when they were young boys. Sandusky's son fits pattern of other alleged victims . And the loving bear hugs that my son's high school coach always gives players after a big win had me looking twice at him and the boys to see if I could detect any signs of unwanted behavior. And he knows why I'm looking twice. I'm not the only parent on high alert. Everything is suspect now. Am I being overly sensitive? A bit too dramatic? Don't think so. This story has made me realize an important truth: . Sports are the perfect playground for pedophiles. We will never be able to fully protect children from evil predators like Jerry Sandusky. But we don't have to be helpless. Post-Sandusky, what have we learned? Will anything change after the headlines recede? What can we do to educate and protect our sons and daughters from the Sanduskys lurking among them? It's time to pull back the curtains on the predatory culture in sports, for journalists to pay more attention to these types of stories. It's time for parents and schools, starting at least at a middle-school level, to talk to kids about inappropriate behavior and how predators operate. This doesn't have to be a sex education class, but certainly schools could begin incorporating into a curriculum instruction in how to recognize and report inappropriate words or touches by coaches and/or teachers. In corporate America, nearly every Human Resources department has mandatory ""Harassment Workshops"" for employees. Even as adults these conversations are never comfortable. By beginning to educate children about sexual abuse we can hopefully open up such conversations to help arm our kids as they grown into adults. We can make it easier for the next assistant coach like Mike McQueary, who testified that he witnessed a child being raped by Sandusky, to immediately take action and call the police instead of second-guessing himself and doing nothing to protect the child. We've learned that adults need to be educated as much as children about how to recognize and expose pedophiles. A child who is abused needs to understand immediately that something is wrong and that her or she must tell somebody. If we don't teach them, they have no chance at all against pedophiles. Telling our kids to stay away from sports or great college programs like Penn State isn't really the answer. This is not just a Penn State problem. It's a sports problem. I know that just as I also know that my love of sports will return. But this time around, I'll be an older and much wiser cheerleader for the games I love. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones says the Sandusky trial and verdict has affected her joy at sports .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Several youths were injured Tuesday in Mali when rebels opened fire on hundreds of people protesting the killing of a local official the night before, witnesses said. The protesters, women and children among them, gathered in the city center in the northern town of Gao on Tuesday morning. Some set up barricades and burned tires. Gao is controlled by Tuareg rebels and the Islamist group Ansar Dine. The violence broke out as people protested against the death of a member of the City Council, Idrissa Oumarou, who was shot on Monday. It was the Tuareg rebels' separatist National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, the MNLA, who opened fire on the protesters, said Aguissa Ag Badara, a local guide who was among the youths who marched toward the group's headquarters. He said the rebels started shooting as they approached the building, hitting a man beside him. ""I saw three people being shot. Others say there were several injured and many had to be taken to the hospital,"" said Ag Badara. Boubacar CissÃ©, a doctor in the hospital in Gao, said he received three severely injured patients, one of whom was in critical condition. ""This morning people took down the flag of MNLA and hoisted the Malian flag,"" he said. ""In the street the youth were burning tires. Later they tried to raise barricades around the town. Again there was shooting."" The West African nation was plunged into chaos by a military coup in March that ousted former President Amadou Toumani Toure. Since then, ethnic Tuareg rebels and militant Islamists have taken advantage of the uncertainty to seize control of the northern portion of the country. Ag Badara said the situation in Gao was tense Tuesday. ""Everyone is tired of the rebels and how they are treating the population. The people want the MNLA to leave Gao,"" he said. ""The Malian military must come and help us."" MNLA spokesman Moussa Ag Assarid denied that any protesters were injured, saying the guards had fired in the air when the demonstrators approached the building. He said he regretted the death of the councilor, which he had heard was the result of ""a misunderstanding between him and the MNLA soldiers."" He claimed the protesters had been manipulated by Ansar Dine, which he said had told the group to march. A transitional government, appointed after the coup leader agreed to a deal with West African nations to hand over power, is supposed to be working toward the restoration of democracy. Mali was shocked last month, however, when a mob stormed the presidential palace in the capital, Bamako, and brutally beat the country's caretaker leader. The country was in the past hailed in the West as a beacon of stability and model of African democracy.","A witness says Tuareg rebels fired on protesters as they marched toward their HQ .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A cruise ship attendant claimed in a federal lawsuit that John Travolta sexually assaulted him during a Caribbean cruise in 2009, according to court documents filed last week. Fabian Zanzi, who said he was assigned to be Travolta's personal attendant, accused the actor of ""harmful and offensive contact"" by ""removing his bath robe, grabbing plaintiff's hand, and forcing his naked person and erect penis against plaintiff's person,"" the complaint said. ""This is another ludicrous lawsuit with inane claims,"" Travolta lawyer Martin Singer said. ""It is obvious that Mr. Zanzi and his lawyers are looking for their 15 minutes of fame."" Another lawsuit, filed by two male massage therapists in April, accused Travolta of sexual assault at hotels in Los Angeles and Atlanta. Those plaintiffs withdrew their suit after firing their lawyer and hiring Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred to handle their case. Allred said at the time she was considering refiling their complaints in another court. Gloria Allred sued over Travolta accusers . Singer called those charges ""ridiculous"" and denied media reports the actor had considered paying to settle the lawsuit. Zanzi's suit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, claims the sexual assault happened on board the Royal Caribbean Cruise ship Enchantment of the Sea in June 2009. The actor came on to the personal room attendant after he delivered food to his room, the suit said. Travolta complained of a pain in his neck and asked Zanzi to touch it. As Zanzi approached, Travolta dropped his bathrobe and ""became completely naked,"" the suit said. ""Travolta proceeded to forcefully embrace plaintiff,"" it said, ""causing plaintiff to continue to experience pain, shock, embarrassment, distress and fear."" He then told Zanzi ""that he was beautiful and asked plaintiff to 'take me, I will take care of you, please,'"" the complaint said. When Zanzi asked to be released from the embrace, ""Travolta maintained a hard and painful grasp on plaintiff's hands,"" the suit said. The suit described the contact as ""nonconsensual, inappropriate, extreme, and outrageous."" Travolta offered Zanzi $12,000 for his ""discretion and silence,"" telling him to return to the suite later that night to collect the money, the suit said. Instead, Zanzi -- ""in a state of pain, shock, embarrassment, distress and fear"" -- immediately reported the incident the the ship's director, human resources manager and a staff captain, the suit said. The human resources manager told him to fill out a report, but she ""refused to allow plaintiff to write down any information regarding the nudity and/or sexual contact"" with Travolta, the suit said. She told him ""unless he was bleeding and bruised, he did not suffer any injuries and thus could not obtain treatment or any other type of attention,"" it said. Instead of taking action against Travolta, the cruise line ordered Zanzi ""restrained"" in ""a segregated room"" for five days, until Travolta was off the ship, the suit said. Zanzi claimed he was ""persistent"" in contacting the cruise line to file a claim against Travolta for the next two years, but he was repeatedly told it was being filed and to check back later. He has since filed an arbitration claim against the company, the suit said. A spokesman for the cruise company declined comment. Zanzi is seeking unspecified monetary damages to be determined at a trial. Travolta's lawyer said the actor is confident he will ""prevail on the merits and that he will be completely vindicated in court."" ""The lawsuit's ridiculous claims are completely contradicted by what Mr. Zanzi told his employer back in 2009 when he was being disciplined for his own violations of company policy,"" Singer said. ""In his handwritten report three years ago, the only physical contact he claimed occurred was allegedly touching my client's neck. The inappropriate conduct he alleges in his lawsuit is absent from his written report he submitted at the time. That glaring omission speaks volumes."" The fact that Zanzi continued to work for the cruise line for years after ""his employer supposedly restrained him in a room on the cruise ship for five days"" calls his credibility into question, Singer said. ""Now, after waiting three years, and after getting paid to tell his story to the media, Mr. Zanzi has filed this absurd lawsuit,"" he said. Zanzi told his story in tabloid reports published in May, soon after the suit was filed by the two massage therapists. Travolta sexual battery lawsuit withdrawn, but case may go on .","Royal Caribbean Cruise employee sues Travolta for ""harmful and offensive contact""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The Indian anti-graft crusader Anna Hazare has begun a new hunger strike to add pressure to his persistent demands for a tough law to deal with endemic corruption in the country. Hazare and his supporters are also seeking special investigations into allegations of corruption they have made against more than a dozen of India's federal government ministers, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh -- accusations the government denies. A 75-year-old former army driver, Hazare galvanized the nation last year with his use of fasting to demand a strong citizen ombudsman to tackle official corruption. The attention his protest generated brought huge political pressure to bear on Singh, who agreed in August to Hazare's demand for the new anti-corruption agency. The resulting legislation, however, has become bogged down in parliament. A protest Hazare organized in Mumbai in December to press lawmakers to act drew fewer people than expected, suggesting the momentum behind his campaign might be waning. But thousands of people turned out in New Delhi on Sunday when the veteran activist commenced his new, open-ended fast, adding his clout to a similar protest that three of his supporters had started Wednesday. Hazare told the crowds that his agitation would continue until the government accepted his group's version of the bill to establish a Jan Lokpal, or citizen ombudsman. Government legislation to create the agency is still pending in parliament, but Hazare and other activists say it is too weak to tackle widespread graft around India, the world's second most populous country after China. ""I want to tell my supporters that I will not die until the Jan Lokpal bill is passed,"" Hazare said Sunday. India's coalition government, led by the Congress party, has been rocked by a series of corruption scandals in recent years. Last year, a former government minister was among a dozen defendants charged in a multibillion-dollar telecom scandal. Andimuthu Raja, a former telecommunication minister, is accused of being involved in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of India's lucrative telecom boom. He denies any wrongdoing. Congress suffered a crushing electoral defeat earlier this year in the key state of Uttar Pradesh in a vote that was considered a litmus test for Singh's government ahead of national elections due in 2014.","Thousands of people in New Delhi attend the start of the fast .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House Oversight Committee filed a civil contempt lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday seeking the release of documents linked to a controversial weapons crackdown. The lawsuit asks a federal court judge to rule that President Barack Obama overstepped his authority in claiming executive privilege over documents sought by the committee in its investigation of the Fast and Furious weapons tracking program. The lawsuit also seeks an order requiring Holder to turn the documents over to House investigators. ""Waiting nearly eight months after the subpoena had been issued to assert a meritless claim of privilege, the President's decision was a calculated political maneuver designed to stop the release of documents until after November's elections, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, said in a statement. No criminal prosecution of Holder for contempt . The lawsuit stems from a contempt of Congress citation passed by the House of Representatives last month, and was expected. The House resolution gave lawmakers the option of filing a lawsuit if the Justice Department declined to file criminal charges against Holder. Democrats say the GOP is using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and Obama in an election year. ""This partisan lawsuit wastes taxpayer dollars and resources, and is a distraction from the urgent business before Congress: acting to create jobs and grow our economy,"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a written statement. ""It is also designed to distract the Justice Department from its critical job of challenging state laws designed to restrict the rights of Americans to vote."" Justice Department Director of Public Affairs Tracy Schmaler said in a statement that Holder's department had been ""always willing to work with the Committee, instead the House and the Committee have said they prefer to litigate."" The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched the Fast and Furious program in Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. It followed similar programs started in the Bush administration. The program lost track of more than 1,000 firearms, two of which turned up in the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Fast and Furious investigation started with agent's death . The Justice Department announced on July 6 that it would not prosecute. The department said it has had a longstanding position across administrations of both parties not to proceed with prosecution when a president has asserted executive privilege, as Obama did. Executive privilege refers to a president's authority to refuse to comply with some demands from lawmakers and judges to turn over documents and other materials. The Obama administration said it was asserting the doctrine in the Fast and Furious case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. Issa said the president was violating his promise to operate openly. ""After promising an unprecedented level of transparency, the President is attempting to expand the reach of executive privilege to obstruct the truth about the reckless conduct that contributed to the death of a Border Patrol Agent and countless Mexican citizens,"" Issa said. ""The family of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, whistleblowers who faced retaliation for exposing the Justice Department's reckless tactics, and the public have a right to know the full extent of what occurred."" House Speaker John Boehner applauded the filing. ""After providing -- then retracting -- inaccurate information to Congress, Attorney General Holder has gone to extraordinary lengths to block access to subpoenaed documents and deny the efforts of the Terry family to get the truth,"" he said in a statement. AME Church: Congress's Holder vote like historical evils . The showdown between Issa and Holder over the program dates to subpoenas issued last year by the House committee seeking a wide range of documents and other materials. Eventually, the committee reduced its demand to focus on documents involving decision-making after the administration shut down the Fast and Furious program. In particular, the committee wanted documents relating to the period after February 2011, when the Justice Department sent Congress an erroneous letter -- later withdrawn -- that said top officials knew nothing about Fast and Furious until early that year. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history . In July, Issa conceded that investigators lack evidence that Holder knew of the failed weapons-tracking tactics of Fast and Furious. The contempt citation, he said, was for Holder's failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents. ""It's not for what the attorney general knew about Fast and Furious,"" Issa said. ""It's about the attorney general's refusal to provide the documents."" White House press secretary Jay Carney said last month that Issa's comment showed the contempt citation was about politics. The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal .

"(CNN) -- An 18-year-old Tibetan monk set himself on fire in a monastery in China's Sichuan province, according to advocacy organizations and the Tibetan government in exile. The teenager, identified as Lobsan Lobzin, self-immolated, shouted slogans and attempted to march towards the local government's office in the town of Ngaba around noon Tuesday, according to the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), which functions as the government of Tibetans outside the Chinese territory. It was unclear what Lobzin shouted before he died, according to the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, a group based in India. My Take: Why the Dalai Lama cannot condemn Tibetan self-immolations . Lobzin became the 44th Tibetan to self-immolate since 2009, according to the CTA. Self-immolation has become a common form of protest for Tibetans who want autonomy from China. The local police office and county government did not comment on the incident when contacted by CNN. The Ministry of Public Security also did not respond to CNN's request for information. After Lobzin's death, Chinese forces headed towards the monastery, but local Tibetans blocked a bridge to prevent the police from a possible confrontation, according to CTA and several Tibetan advocacy groups. Lobzin had been at the Tsodun Kirti Monastery in Barkham County since he was young, according to the group, Free Tibet. He was described as being ""one of the best students"" at the monastery. An act of faith, desperation or protest . Earlier in March, two other monks from the same monastery set themselves on fire. The group, Free Tibet, has described the self-immolations as ""a fundamental rejection of China's occupation."" Timeline of Tibetan protests in China . The Dalai Lama has remained silent on the issue of self-immolations, refusing to answer questions earlier this year about whether monks should stop setting themselves on fire in protest. Costica Bradatan, an assistant professor in the Honors College at Texas Tech University, observed that the Tibetan self-immolators were young and even teens, ""which indicates that the new generation of politically aware Tibetans might have lost patience with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent political philosophy. ""In essence, these self-immolations are an extreme form of political self-expression. They are performed as part of a struggle for recognition, as an autonomous political community,"" he wrote in a CNN opinion piece. Bradatan noted that the self-immolation of a young Tunisian street vendor in 2010 sparked an uprising that spread throughout the Arab world, yet dozens of Tibetan self-immolations have yielded little political results.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Thursday that the United States was ""reaching the limits of our patience"" with Pakistan over militants that attack U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan from havens within its borders. ""It's extremely important that Pakistan take action to prevent this kind of safe haven,"" he said during an unannounced visit to Kabul, and that militants cannot use the country as a ""safety net"" from which to attack U.S. soldiers. Afghan leader condemns NATO airstrike; U.S. defense secretary visits Kabul . ""We have made that very, very clear time and time again, and we will continue to do that,"" he said. Panetta also stressed that troops on the Afghan border have every right to defend themselves against the al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network and other militant groups when they launch attacks from Pakistan. ""Anybody who attacks U.S. soldiers is our enemy. We are not going to take it,"" he said. ""We have every responsibility to defend ourselves, and we are going to make very clear that we are prepared to take them on -- and we have to put pressure on Pakistan to take them on as well."" Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak, speaking alongside Panetta at a news conference, said havens in Pakistan were the ""most important"" issue confronting Afghanistan as it seeks to secure a stable future. Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, Sherry Rehman, said Panetta's comments were unhelpful. ""This kind of public messaging from a senior member of the U.S. administration is taken very seriously in Pakistan and reduces the space for narrowing our bilateral differences at a critical time in the negotiations,"" she said. ""It adds an unhelpful twist to the process and leaves little oxygen for those of us seeking to break a stalemate."" Islamabad has yet to respond to Panetta's remarks. The defense secretary may also have irritated Pakistani leaders with remarks during a stop in India on Wednesday in which he joked about Pakistan being kept out of the loop as U.S. intelligence tracked al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden to a Pakistani town, flew undetected into the country and killed him. Asked if Pakistan had interfered in the operation in any way, Panetta replied to laughter: ""They didn't know about our operation. That was the whole idea."" A senior military official in Pakistan, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN: ""This is Washington's way of piling on pressure on Pakistan. It's a tactic they've used for a long time. Pakistan has sacrificed thousands of lives, and here you have someone laughing. It shows their level of thinking."" Panetta's stern words came three days after a CIA drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed Abu Yahya al-Libi, the No. 2 man in al Qaeda and a longtime public face of the terrorist network, and at a time of strained Pakistani-U.S. relations. Monday's strike was the third such deadly attack in as many days and the 21st suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan this year. At least six missiles were fired at a militant compound near the town of Mir Ali in the North Waziristan region, near the Afghan border. Pakistani lawmakers have called for an immediate end to the drone strikes, which have been denounced for killing civilians. While in India, Panetta said Washington had made clear to Pakistan that it would defend itself against those who sought to attack the United States. ""And we have done just that. We have gone after their leadership, and we have done it effectively ... targeting al Qaeda leadership and terrorists. ""And very frankly, the terrorists who threaten the United States threaten Pakistan as well. This is not just about protecting the United States; it's also about protecting Pakistan. And we have made very clear that we are going to continue to defend ourselves."" Is not planning for more defense cuts the right plan? Panetta is not the first high-ranking U.S. official to point the finger at Pakistan over a failure to take on extremists within its borders. Addressing Congress in September, just before he retired as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen said the Haqqani network acted as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence agency. He also told CNN that elements in Pakistan's spy service were ""very active"" with the Haqqani network in launching attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan and that the U.S. and Pakistani governments and military must work together to tackle the problem. Mullen's blunt remarks to U.S. senators were widely interpreted as an expression of the growing impatience of U.S. officials with Pakistan's unwillingness to stop the attacks and the belief that elements in the Pakistani government are actively supporting the insurgents. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said that Panetta's criticism did not represent a significant change of tone and that Pakistani officials mostly ""tune out"" such comments. ""They are usually pretty frustrated by calls from the United States to do more when they know that more Pakistani soldiers have died fighting the Taliban than U.S. and NATO soldiers combined,"" he said. At the same time, the Pentagon is very frustrated over the continued presence of the Haqqani network, since it is the most effective of the militant groups operating out of Pakistan, Bergen said. But Pakistan is not going to move against the Haqqani network for multiple reasons, Bergen said, including the risk that it wouldn't go well from a military point of view and the fact that the United States plans to withdraw the bulk of its forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. However, while Pakistan is keen to ensure that India does not gain sway in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of international forces, it is also in Islamabad's interests to see its neighbor remain stable and out of the hands of the Taliban, he added. Panetta visits former U.S. base in Vietnam . Panetta did not visit Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, during his nine-day Asia trip, which included stops in Vietnam and Singapore as well as New Delhi. Relations between Washington and Islamabad have been particularly tense since NATO airstrikes killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers in November. After the fatal airstrikes, the Pakistani government shut down the two NATO supply routes in the country, asked the United States to vacate an air base on its territory and boycotted a conference about the future of Afghanistan. NATO insists that the incident was an accident. U.S. defense secretary announces new strategy with Asia . President Barack Obama's administration recently defended its use of unmanned drones to target suspected terrorists overseas in a rare public statement, with John Brennan, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, saying the strikes are conducted ""in full accordance with the law."" The program uses unmanned aerial vehicles, often equipped with Hellfire missiles, to target suspected terrorists in remote locations overseas, with many such strikes occurring in Yemen and Pakistan, despite internal opposition to the practice within the latter country. Brennan said the United States ""respects national sovereignty and international law"" and is guided by the laws of war in ordering those attacks. Despite the public discussion of bad blood between the United States and Pakistan, Bergen cautions against reading too much into the dispute over NATO ground supply routes. Pakistan's airspace has remained open to NATO forces throughout the dispute and is much more important to international operations, he said. Pakistan was also invited to last month's NATO summit in Chicago -- at which leaders signed off on the plan for withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan -- without any insistence that the supply lines be opened, he said, in a small sign of easing tensions. The Pakistani border area is widely believed to be the operating base for the Haqqani network and other militant groups that have attacked international troops in neighboring Afghanistan.

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- The father of a 16-year-old on Saudi Arabia's Olympic team said his daughter has been called names by people in her home country for competing at the London Games. Wojdan Shaherkani was one of two women who competed in the Olympics for Saudi Arabia, which was one of three countries that agreed for the first time to send women to compete at the Games. ""Some people hid behind (fake) Twitter accounts, and they said bad things about my daughter and myself,"" Wojdan's father, Ali Seraj Shaherkani, told CNN recently. ""... After the competition, I returned home, I read on Twitter that somebody said bad words about my daughter. Three people on Twitter accused her of being a 'prostitute.'"" He said he filed a complaint with the Ministry of Interior over the name-calling. ""In religion, if anyone accuses a woman of being a prostitute, he has to prove it or receive lashes or punishment,"" Shaherkani said. Blog: London Olympics breaks new ground for women . Wojdan made history during the Olympics when she was selected by the kingdom to compete in judo at the Games, though the opportunity was almost derailed when the International Judo Federation said she could not compete wearing a head scarf. The teen and her father signed an agreement with Saudi Olympics officials that she would be allowed to compete only if she wore ""correct and approved"" clothing that ""sticks to Islamic principles,"" according to Saudi National Olympic Committee representative Razen Baker. An agreement was eventually struck between Saudi Arabia, the International Olympic Committee and the Judo federation. Opinion: Saudi women going to games is a sham . Wojdan was dispatched quickly in her first match, losing to 28-year-old Melissa Mojica of Puerto Rico in one minute, 22 seconds. According to quotes provided by Olympic officials after the match, Wojdan called the experience ""the opportunity of a lifetime."" ""Hopefully this will be the start of bigger participation for other sports also. Hopefully this is the (beginning) of a new era,"" she said. Her father knew she would likely lose, saying she had never competed in front of an audience before her match at the Games. But in defeat, Shaherkani said he was even more proud of his daughter. The audience of 15,000 at London's Excel Center applauded the teen. Read more: Arab sportswomen finally in the picture . ""She was smiling on the way out. She told me 'I did it. Next time I'll win.' I cried when I heard that,"" said Shaherkani, who worked as a referee in the men's Judo competition. ""She's amazing. Really, she's amazing."" Perhaps the most difficult thing for the family has been the reaction of some in their native Saudi Arabia. ""I want everyone to respect my daughter. I respect all the people talking about my daughter when she went to London - they either accepted her trip or not,"" Shaherkani said. ""I respect all these people. But whoever talks bad about my daughter, will be punished."" The family has seen a change in attitude since Wojdan began her Olympic journey. Before the Games, Shaherkani about 75 percent of the people in the country disapproved with his daughter's Olympic effort ""because it's a new thing for Saudi Arabia to go outside the kingdom as a woman and compete in public."" ""People think we are breaking our religion. But in our mind, we are not doing that. We are doing something I am proud of,"" he said. ""We gave the whole world a good picture of the women in Saudi Arabia."" Since the competition, he said ""maybe 80 to 85 percent"" agree with his daughter's effort. ""I hope my daughter can perform in the next Olympics in 2016. In four years she will be better,"" he said. ""I think my daughter will get some medals some day.""

"New York (CNN) -- The convicted architect of a plot to blow up jet-fuel supply tanks and a pipeline at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport is suspected of having conspired to murder one of his attorneys, among others, while in jail, according to a letter unsealed in Brooklyn federal court. Russell Defreitas allegedly asked his fellow prisoners to help him carry out several murders, according to a March 2010 letter from prosecutors to Defreitas' attorneys, which was released Tuesday. He allegedly told a fellow inmate that he wanted his attorney, Mildred Whalen, whom he described as ""Jewish,"" dead ""because she is the reason his first attorney was removed from the case."" Whalen told CNN that she thought the claims were ""ridiculous"" and that she never felt threatened by Defreitas. The letter says Defreitas also threatened to kill a witness named ""Rutherford,"" as well as an unnamed prosecutor. According to the inmate, who is identified in the letter as ""W1,"" Defreitas said that his co-defendant in the JFK plot, Abdel Nur, told him that the prosecutor ""had to go."" Defreitas asked the inmate to contact his wife in Guyana and to deliver these messages to her, in exchange for a ""promotion in Muslim ranks"" and access to Defreitas' ""contacts,"" the letter says. Another target of Defreitas' alleged prison plot included Steve Francis, an informant who secretly taped Defreitas and his JFK plot conspirators. He allegedly discussed plans to kill Francis with a second prisoner, identified in the letter as ""W2."" Defreitas told the prisoner that he thought Francis had taped around 150 hours of recordings regarding the JFK plot, but had recently found out that there were more than 300 hours, the letter detailed. He allegedly told the prisoner that ""the only way to beat the case now was to have Francis killed,"" according to the letter.

"(Financial Times) -- South Korean financial regulators will investigate the Seoul branches of Standard Chartered and HSBC in light of money laundering allegations against both banks by regulators in the US. A spokeswoman for South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service on Thursday said the regulator would review the banks' responses to preliminary written inquiries before visiting their offices around the end of this month. She added the investigation was prompted entirely by developments in the US, and that the regulator had no specific grounds to suspect wrongdoing by the banks' Korean branches. New York state regulators this week accused StanChart of breaching sanctions against Iran through illicit transactions -- which the bank denies -- while HSBC took a $700m charge last month to cover US fines over its Mexican division's failure to prevent money laundering. ""We will look into their businesses related to money laundering comprehensively to see if they reported suspicious transactions, including those with the countries with which financial transactions are restricted, and if they verified their customers [before such transactions],"" the FSS said. HSBC said: ""We will provide all the information FSS is requesting on a timely basis and we will give any other support they need."" StanChart said: ""We can say that we are in regular dialogue with our local regulators on all relevant matters, and we will cooperate fully with the FSS. We would also like to note that the Group strongly rejects the position or portrayal of facts as set out in the order issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services."" Shares in StanChart on Monday suffered their heaviest one-day fall in decades after New York state's Department of Financial Services branded it a ""rogue institution"" and accused it of having breached US sanctions by carrying out $250bn worth of transactions with the Iranian government. StanChart has angrily denied the allegations, saying it had identified only $14m worth of non-compliant transactions, which it attributes clerical errors. It is now considering a countersuit against the DFS. Interactive timeline . One former senior regulator said that financial watchdogs in South Korea -- which has long seen the US as its most important ally -- would be particularly concerned by any suggestion of illicit dealings with Iran. ""The Korean financial regulators have always been quite mindful of the US sanctions and the regulations related to Iranian counterparties,"" he said. ""It's always been a serious issue for the government and the regulators, and I think this is part of that."" The investigation comes less than a month after South Korean competition authorities launched an investigation into nine commercial banks, including StanChart's local operation, over suspicions that they may have colluded to manipulate the country's benchmark lending rate. Both banks have had a mixed experience in South Korea. HSBC has attained a foothold in wholesale banking, but has struggled to make an impact in the retail banking market. It reached a preliminary agreement in April to sell its Korean retail business to Korea Development Bank, but talks broke down last month. StanChart, which acquired Korea First Bank in 2005, was badly affected last year by strikes caused by its attempt to introduce performance-related pay.

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Amid an ongoing congressional probe into the General Services Administration, a CNN investigation has uncovered more evidence of wasteful spending at the agency, including cooking classes for employees that cost as much as $3,350 per class. For years, the GSA paid to send employees to these cooking classes to build team spirit, part of a spending pattern that the agency now says was inappropriate. Employees based in Kansas City, Missouri, attended classes at The Culinary Center of Kansas City, located in suburban Overland Park, where they cooked meals. Senator encourage GSA to 'clean house' The GSA confirmed that there were nine classes beginning in June 2007, with the last class in June 2011. The total cost to the GSA was $20,701. ""We should be thinking about our federal customers, our taxpayers and our associates,"" said one employee who attended a cooking class. ""And that seems to have been lost in these team-building exercises ... If you don't go, you're ostracized.'' The employee works in the Kansas City office and requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to CNN and feared reprisals from his supervisors. ""These events indicate a pattern of misjudgment, which spans several years and administrations,"" GSA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara told CNN in a statement. In the world of trillion-dollar government budgets, the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money. However, the unnamed employee and other insiders told CNN that this was part of the free-spending culture that went on for years at the GSA's Kansas City regional headquarters. Congressional committees are examining GSA spending after a scathing inspector general's report issued earlier this year showed lavish spending -- $823,000 -- at the Western Regions Conference, which took place in Las Vegas in October 2010. Jeff Neely, the GSA official who organized the conference, resigned, as well the agency's administrator, Martha Johnson. Two of Johnson's deputies were fired and eight other employees left the agency. Dan Tangherlini, a former Treasury Department official, took over as acting GSA administrator. The General Services Administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a $26.3 billion budget, is tasked with helping manage and support government agencies. In addition to the Las Vegas conference, the GSA apparently spent $330,000 to relocate an employee from Denver to Hawaii -- and likely millions more dollars on other employees over a two year period -- according to a transcript of an interview with a GSA event planner. And 84 GSA employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff -- all subjects of inspector general investigations -- are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than $1 million in taxpayer money. Alcantara says all the agency's practices are under a top-down review. ""This must stop, and is why Acting Administrator Tangherlini has instituted stringent new policies on conferences and events -- to put an end to this misuse of taxpayer dollars,"" she said in the GSA statement. Laura Laiben, who owns The Culinary Center in Kansas City, said it appeared from her records that the GSA also had two classes in 2004, but the agency could not find records of those events. She referred CNN to the GSA regarding the costs of the classes. During the classes, participants prepare meals as team-building exercises. But under the new GSA policy, any future team-building events could only be held in a federal facility. ""Only light refreshments, like water and pretzels, would be allowed,"" the GSA statement said. A GSA spokesperson on Thursday clarified the agency's policy, saying that no food will be permitted at any team building exercises. GSA records show classes from June 2007 to June 2011, with the cost ranging from $1,162 to $3,350 per class, depending on the number of employees who attended. The size of the classes varied from eight to 37 employees. The culinary center's ""menu of classes"" states that its ""state-of-the-art kitchens create a unique atmosphere where your group can work together to build trust, develop plans of action, work toward a common goal, make it happen and celebrate their accomplishments."" The GSA turned down repeated requests by CNN for an on-camera interview with Tangherlini or Jason Klumb, the regional administrator for the Heartland region. However, Tangherlini agreed to an interview on Wednesday, hours before this story was schedule to air on CNN's AC360. ""I think the most important thing is we need to make -- we need to get a message across that this isn't what GSA is about. People aren't coming to work for cooking classes,"" Tangherlini said. ""They aren't coming to work for awards or prizes. They are coming to work for an important mission that's critical to serving our agencies that serve the American people. And so that's the trick for us is to really build a better sense of expectation of what it is that we're going to do every day when we do our jobs."" He said employees ""really believe and value the service of providing excellent ... high value public buildings and low cost acquisition services, so I think that they're really committed to what they're doing and we just need to give them the right leadership, give them the right systems, and give them the right tools. Also, the right level of accountability."" Who's on first? Hearing shows GSA's dysfunction . Klumb agreed to an interview after CNN showed up at a public event he was hosting at the Kansas City headquarters. He said he had not heard about the cooking classes until CNN began asking about them. ""And I was unaware of those until, actually, you brought them to my attention, and that unfortunately has been the recent organizational structure. And that's part of what we're seeing in the change in GSA."" Asked about this kind of spending, Klumb said, ""I think it was the old culture at GSA, and you saw it in all the news that was generated out of the Western Regions Conference."" During the interview, Klumb said he did not have the authority to stop activities such as cooking classes. However, Alcantara pointed to an April 15 memo that suspended spending for training conferences, leadership events, award ceremonies and team-building. As part of the new GSA structure, these types of events would have to be approved by headquarters and the regional administrator. ""Under the new GSA leadership, regional administrators have the authority to stop cooking classes from taking place. On top of that, there is also a second layer of oversight in place, at central office, that would prevent this type of wasteful spending,"" Alcantara said in the statement. The cooking classes weren't the only example of questionable spending in GSA's Heartland region. CNN obtained records that showed the agency spent $2,938 on an awards luncheon on November 16, 2011 in the Kansas City headquarters for 178 employees, and hired an etiquette speaker for a GSA Industry Day event in March 2010 in St. Louis that cost the agency $993. C.K. Reisinger, a consultant, speaker and coach, confirmed that her luncheon speech focused on etiquette training. ""We walk through the place settings and the different courses... how to eat soup and salad, what to do with your napkin, how to butter your roll,"" she said. ""Passing the salt and pepper -- there is a long litany of what is good dining etiquette. You look much more professional when someone knows the rules of dining."" She said she compares ""the rules of dining to motor vehicle rules. Without safety, we'd be running amok. There's a proper way to go about it."" Video offers glimpse inside GSA's lavish Las Vegas conference . The GSA employee compared the agency to a high school pep club. ""And if you had a pep club that had government funding, imagine what you could do. You could make the best floats, you could have the best decorations. And so there is a lot of what I would look at as juvenile behavior when it comes to caring about what the taxpayers' money is used for,"" the employee told CNN. Last November, the GSA in Kansas City launched ""the first annual Merry Holiday Video Contest"" in which employees produced videos to highlight the agency's efficiency. The videos, all shot and produced on government time, show employees in various skits and holiday outfits. The winner received an ice cream social. After news accounts of the Las Vegas scandal, the videos, which were accessible online to employees, were taken down, the GSA confirmed. Klumb told CNN he was one of the judges for the video contest. ""So some of the things I was aware of -- in fact, in the holiday videos, I was one of the judges,"" Klumb said. ""Again, that was part of the culture that was pretty common throughout GSA, and something that is changing, and I think you see a new day at GSA.""

"(CNN) -- The scandal engulfing four Olympic badminton teams has appeared to have abruptly ended the career of one of China's most promising players. Yu Yang announced Wednesday she was quitting the sport after the Badminton World Federation disqualified her and her doubles partner, along with three other teams, for ""not using one's best efforts to win a match."" ""This is my last match,"" Yu Yang wrote in a microblog to her 1.3 million followers. ""Farewell Badminton World Federation; farewell my beloved badminton."" Yu and her partner Wang Xiaoli were ranked number one in the world according to the Badminton World Federation. Together, they had dominated national and international competitions, including the 2011 women's doubles World Championship. Before that, Yu won gold at the Beijing 2008 Olympics and World Championship 2010 title with her former doubles partner, Du Jing. She partnered with Wang after Du was sidelined by injury. A native of Liaoning Province, Yu began playing badminton at the age of 10, according to Chinese media. She graduated from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2006. In a passionate post on her weibo account, Yu explained why she and Wang had held back while playing South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na at London's Wembley Arena. ""We were injured before the match,"" Yu wrote. ""And we were just using the rules to give up the match in order to play better in the next knock-out round. This is the first time that group round-robin elimination was adopted in the Olympics. Do you understand the pain athletes suffer?"" She said the federation's decision to disqualify them had ""mercilessly shattered our dreams."" Yu, Wang and six other players were disqualified from the Olympics for throwing matches to try to influence who their opponents would be in the next round. The federation found that they conducted themselves ""in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport."" Yu's resignation was at odds with the contrite line taken by the Chinese Olympic Committee, which said in a statement carried by state-run Xinhua that it ""fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decisions."" ""The behavior of Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli violated the principles of the Olympic Movement and went against the spirit of fair play. It hurt our hearts. The Chinese Olympic Committee has always been firmly against any conduct that is against sportsmanship."" The committee went on to say that it had ""launched an internal investigation"" and ""would take further action pending the results of the probe."" China emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s. It holds the highest number of Olympic medals for the sport, including 11 of 24 gold medals awarded since badminton debuted at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. China also holds eight Thomas Cups,11 Uber Cups, and seven Sudirman Cups, the leading international competitions for men, women, and mixed teams, respectively, under the Badminton World Federation. Female player Gao Ling holds four Olympic medals, including two golds-- the highest number of Olympic medals for the sport.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Occupy Central in Hong Kong, one of the last outposts of the global protests sparked by the Occupy Wall Street movement, has been ordered to clear its encampment outside one of the world's largest banks. For ten months, protestors have gathered at HSBC's headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district to air their grievances against corporate greed and social inequality . But on Monday, a Hong Kong court ruled in favor of HSBC's request to remove protesters camped by the entrance of its Asia-Pacific headquarters. Although the bank is required by law to provide a passageway for pedestrians at its headquarters, the court ruled that protesters have no legal right to stake their ground. ""We welcome the decision of the court,"" HSBC spokesperson Gareth Hewett wrote in an email, adding that protesters will have two weeks to clear out before the bank intervenes. While the number of active protestors has dwindled, more than a dozen tents remain at the site. Ho Yiu Sing, one of three defendants who appeared in court on Monday, has camped under the bank since November. The former financial analyst said he was treated unfairly in court and was disappointed by the verdict. He plans to leave the encampment, but hopes to find an alternate place to protest. ""Nowadays, most Hong Kong people aren't happy,"" Ho said. ""The workers work for their whole lives for Hong Kong but they don't have money to buy food."" Chin Tang, an active Occupy Central member who works as a freelance graphic designer, said the protest sends a crucial anti-capitalist message to a city that is fueled by finance. ""We plan on coming back if they decide to evict us by force but we're not going to leave voluntarily,"" she added. The order to evict Occupy protestors in Hong Kong comes a week after police cleared Occupy Frankfurt's encampment outside the European Central Bank's headquarters. Most Occupy encampments in major cities have not enjoyed such longevity. Protestors at Occupy Wall Street -- where the first Occupy protest took place -- were evicted by police from their Zuccotti Park grounds two months in. London's iconic protest at Finsbury Square was removed by the local council after eight months. The Occupy movement, which grew to encompass 900 cities, stemmed from a call for an ""occupation"" of New York City's financial center, published in Adbusters, an anti-consumerism magazine based in Vancouver, Canada. The grassroots movement has attracted a disparate group of protesters, bound by grievances toward socioeconomic inequality.","Occupy protest in Hong Kong ordered by court to clear encampment .

"(CNN) -- As the violence intensifies in Syria, external powers, including the United States, are embracing increasingly belligerent positions. Indeed, in recent days the United States and Turkey have announced plans to study a no-fly zone after calls by many American commentators for a more direct military role. Although there is no doubt the government of President Bashar al-Assad carries the overwhelming responsibility for the unfolding tragedy in Syria, the attempt to militarily defeat the regime is the wrong strategy if the goals are reducing violence and protecting innocent civilians. The best strategy for those who wish to avoid a protracted war in Syria is to bring Russia and Iran to the international diplomatic table. Russian and Iranian participation are essential to a viable post-al-Assad transition; the alternative, a transitional plan generated exclusively by the United States and its allies, can be accomplished only through force. To insist on the military path without engaging Assad's backers is to condemn Syrian civilians to escalating violence in pursuit of regime change. To date, external backers of the two sides have focused on arming their local proxies rather than negotiating. Russia and Iran have reiterated their commitment to the Assad government, both diplomatically and through direct support. Recent reports suggest that the United States has doubled down on funding the rebels with a secret presidential order authorizing military assistance (stopping short for now of actual ""lethal aid,"" which has been outsourced to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in coordination with Turkey). The current confrontational approach is unsurprising, because toppling the Syrian regime would alter the regional balance of power against Iran and in favor of pro-Western governments. Until quite recently the United States was prepared to partner with the al-Assad regime, however repressive: the country played a well-documented role in the United States' extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects. But with the United States and Israel contemplating an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, wresting control of Syria from an Iranian supporter and severing links between Damascus and Hezbollah are strategic goals served by assistance to the rebels. Opinion: Syria's chemical weapons threat demands a response . Unfortunately, removing an Iranian ally in Syria may look like low-cost regime change, but it will be more costly in the long run than most analysts suppose, and in the short run these policies are likely to contribute to a drawn out and increasingly bloody civil war. As recent weeks have shown, the rebels have only begun to achieve parity through indiscriminate armed attacks, often resulting in as many casualties among civilians as among the ostensible targets. Even with additional arms, opposition groups resisting al-Assad's repression may fight the regime only to a standstill. More direct American military involvement to shift the balance decisively in favor of the rebels would be even more damaging. In order to defeat the regime militarily, the United States and its allies would have to dramatically heighten the magnitude of destruction wrought on the country, resulting in greater civilian casualties. They would also confront complications absent in Libya as a result of Syria's strategically sensitive location, much larger population, and greater demographic diversity and internal tensions. For these very reasons, U.S. government preparations for the post-al-Assad fallout use Iraq rather than Libya as the relevant comparison. Unfortunately, the current international approach seems more likely to repeat rather than avoid U.S. mistakes in Iraq. By funneling weapons to the rebels through regional actors, the rebels' external backers are setting the stage for escalating sectarian conflict -- even ethnic cleansing -- pitting Sunni constituencies backed by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar against opponents that they increasingly identify in sectarian terms as Alawites rather than regime supporters. The result is a deeply destabilized Syria bordering on Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon, creating the potential for a long-term proxy war between regional Sunni and Shia political forces. The eventual outcome would have no clear winner but a multitude of losers, most crucially ordinary Syrian civilians. Opinion: Is Syria unsolvable? Still there remains a chance to produce a transition process that ensures the security of all communities -- including the Alawites -- ending violence in exchange for Assad's departure. But threatening the regime with decapitation through military escalation will not produce such a process. Much as the Saleh regime was removed from power through pressure from Yemen's principal supporters (including the United States), Iranian and Russian pressure can succeed where force from hostile outsiders has not. In Yemen, this was achieved because the Saleh regime's backers managed the transition while assuring their interests were secure. Without similar assurances there is little reason to expect Russian and Iranian support for a post-Assad transition. To facilitate transition, the United States should engage both Iran and Russia through creative diplomacy. Iran's cooperation on Syria might be linked to the question of its nuclear program, perhaps forestalling sanctions that have yet to come into effect. Similarly, Russia's strategic interests must be addressed, such as preserving the Russian navy's current access to the Mediterranean through Syrian ports. If the goal is to end the violence and transition to a post-al-Assad Syria, this is the only credible option. In resigning as special envoy to Syria, Kofi Annan drew attention to the urgent need for diplomacy, not clandestine intervention. Unless this warning is heeded, Annan's likely replacement, Lakhdar Brahimi, may find no other way out of a lengthy civil war of devastating proportions, both for the Syrian people and for the Middle East as a whole. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Bali and Rana: To save Syria, bring Russia and Iran to the international diplomatic table .

"Olympic Stadium, London (CNN) -- The 2012 London Olympics has been an awe-inspiring event -- with daily doses of drama, guts and glory -- but its zenith was always going to be the showdown of the gladiators of pace that is the men's 100 meters final. Of all Olympic disciplines there are none as original, pure and spectacular as this hallowed contest. Original: Because the first 13 ancient Games consisted only of the ""stadion"" discipline, the short-distance sprint race that ran the length of the stadium in Olympia. Pure: Because every person on the planet, barring disability, can relate to running as fast as their legs will carry them; everyone knows in some way their own limits in this capacity and, consequently, respecting the audacity of the world's finest and fastest athletes over the distance is an easy connection to make. Spectacular: Because there is no moment in the sporting world that has such intensity of drama. Bolt sprints to Olympic gold . The superhuman nature of its combatants connects with the human psyche in a primal and magnetic way, and has transfixed populations from ancient times to modern. Thousands of lucky souls in attendance at London's packed-to-the-rafters Olympic Stadium were witness to the latest chapter of this thousand-year narrative and in Usain Bolt witnessed arguably its greatest character add to his legend. Another two billion were estimated to be watching the feat live on television screens worldwide. Hindsight would always see the hero prevail, but much was in doubt ahead of the race. True, Bolt was the reigning Olympic champion of 2008, but the 25-year-old's aura of invincibility had taken major blows since he shattered the world record in Berlin in 2009. Concerns pervaded over Bolt's form and fitness; worries that escalated when he lost to his training partner and rival Yohan Blake in Jamaica's trials barely a month before the Games. Olympic blog: Day 9 action as it happened . There was a scrutiny associated with Bolt's every move that no other athlete had to contend with either. Relentless interviews followed endless commercial commitments. His actions may still have conveyed a man who was carefree and confident, but this was a young man who was well versed with the energy-sapping rigors of celebrity on a grand scale. But the task of the champion is to overcome. The first indications of the marvel that was to happen came in the semifinal heats, where Bolt cruised to victory by covering the yardage in little over 10 seconds and seemingly without breaking from second gear. There was a nonchalant swagger to the way qualification was assured. Ahead of the final itself there was no one cooler than the 1.96 meter tall Jamaican. While 80,000 people collectively fidgeted, fretted and fussed in anticipation of the main event, Bolt remained immune to the pressure. He jested as the myriad of TV cameras honed on his expressions, gesticulating how fast he would run with two rapidly moving index and middle fingers. He shrugged and he smiled. The runners were called to their marks, forming a line of the fleet-footed finest. Many champions in their own right: Gay, Gatlin and Ryan from America; Blake, Powell and Thompson from the Caribbean. Then silence. The pilgrims of the London coliseum were called on to endure a claustrophobic wait by large video screens that said: ""Quiet please."" ""Set! ..."" A lone helicopter broke the noiseless air, hovering miles in the distance. Collective breath was held. BANG!! Eight heads rose in a line on the track as a wave of sound and flash photography exploded around the stadium before crashing on to the most scrutinized piece of land on the planet like a tsunami. Bolt's reaction time was typically slow, with Gatlin, Blake and Gay faster out of the blocks, but the legs in lane seven were starting to drive. At 20 meters the head was up and the long stride was reeling in the lost ground; by 50, Bolt had drawn level, arms now pumping like pistons, torso bucking in time. The heat was on. The line of sprinters in alternate lanes of red and yellow (USA in red, Jamaica in yellow) squeezed every sinew to keep up with the new pacemaker. Bolt relaxed, elongated his stride and left the rest in his wake. When he crossed the line after 9.63 seconds he was a good meter ahead of the field. The time -- the second fastest in history -- was a new Olympic record and Bolt had achieved what only Carl Lewis had before: to have won gold medals twice in the event. He had beaten three other athletes who ran under 9.8 seconds (9.85 was the world record up until 2008), making it the fastest 100m podium of all time. Usain Bolt: The man whose name sounds preordained by the Gods, a real-life superman, the greatest sprint showman that ever lived, the world-record holder and the newly crowned double Olympic champion. The king still reigns, and he'll be running the 200m in a few days time...","Men's 100 meter sprint the most original, pure, spectacular Olympic event .

"(CNN) -- Team USA's women booked a fifth successive Olympic soccer final after Alex Morgan's header 20 seconds from the end of extra time handed them a dramatic 4-3 victory over Canada. Morgan nodded home in the final minute of extra-time to book the United States a tie with Japan in Thursday's Wembley final, where Pia Sundhage's team will go for a third Olympic gold. Canada led three times in the match thanks to a hat-trick from captain Christine Sinclair, but each time the U.S. responded and eventually prevailed thanks to Morgan's dramatic winner. World champions Japan booked a place in the gold medal match with a 2-1 defeat of France, who will play Canada in the bronze medal contest. Canada has never finished higher than eighth in an Olympic soccer tournament, but John Herdman's side took a shock lead when striker Sinclair coolly converted after 22 minutes. Protecting a proud Olympic record the U.S. responded and finally drew level when Megan Rapinoe's corner squeezed between Canada goalkeeper Erin McLeod and the near post 10 minutes into the second half. Undeterred Canada hit back, Sinclair powering a fine header beyond the despairing Hope Solo in the U.S. goal after 67 minutes. In a frantic period midway through the second half five goals were scored in 26 minutes, and Rapinoe hit a stunning half volley from the corner of the penalty area to level the match at 2-2 with 20 minutes to go. The imperious Sinclair headed Canada ahead for the third time just three minutes later, but the U.S. found an equalizer in controversial fashion. Goalkeeper McLeod was penalized by the referee for holding the ball longer than the allotted six seconds and from the resulting free kick Diana Matheson was adjudged to have handled Rapinoe's shot. Prolific striker Abby Wambach calmly converted the penalty to make it 3-3, before Morgan settled the match in the dying moments of extra-time.","Alex Morgan's extra time header puts Team USA into their fifth Olympic soccer final .

"(CNN) -- A Mali separatist movement on Sunday said it was prepared to act against Islamic militants following the destruction of three sacred tombs in Timbuktu, and called on the United States and France ""to help us kill them."" The tombs, a 15th-century shrine to Muslim saints, are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site in Timbuktu. UNESCO on Saturday condemned the destruction and called for it to stop. The U.N. agency, which sponsors cultural, scientific and educational programs to further peaceful relations between nations, has received reports that three of the site's 16 mausoleums were ""completely destroyed,"" UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova told CNN on Sunday. They are the mausoleums of Sidi Mahmoud, Sidi Moctar and Alpha Moya. Islamic militants set fire to sacred tombs in Timbuktu . Timbuktu Mayor Ousmane Halle said that Muslims on their way to Friday worship at the tombs were stopped and threatened by armed men from Ansar Dine, a militant group that seeks to impose strict Sharia law. Ansar Dine has threatened to continue the destruction. ""It's very, very bad for the Azawad people and the whole world what Ansar Dine has done in Timbuktu. We condemn it completely,"" Moussa Ag Assarid, spokesman for the Tuareg rebels' National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, or MNLA, said Sunday. The group promotes a separate state it calls Azawad. ""We are ready and preparing to right with these terrorist organizations,"" Assarid said. ""We will move soon, and (are) taking our arms and vehicles and material, but we still need help."" The MNLA claims Islamist extremist groups including Ansar Dine, Boko Haram and al Qaeda have seized control of Timbuktu along with the towns of Gao and Kidal, and have killed top MNLA leaders there. ""We call on the USA, France and all other countries who want to stand against Ansar Dine, Boko Haram and al Qaeda who are now holding Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal to help us kill them and help the people in those cities,"" Assarid said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is ""concerned by the worsening security and humanitarian situation in northern Mali"" and reports of the destruction, his office said in a statement. ""Such attacks against cultural heritage sites are totally unjustified,"" the statement said. Witnesses said the destruction began on Friday. ""The militants broke the doors and wooden gates to the grave and then used the cloth inside to set fire to the tomb,"" said Sankoum Sissoko of Timbuktu. ""They started chasing people away, telling them they shouldn't worship a saint, a human being."" The World Heritage Committee on Thursday accepted the request of Mali's government to place Timbuktu on the list of endangered UNESCO sites. That request was reportedly what angered the militants, who accused UNESCO of cooperating with the government. Timbuktu's treasures at risk . France, the former colonial power in Mali, also condemned the attack, calling for an end to the violence. Mali was plunged into chaos by a military coup in March that ousted former President Amadou Toumani Toure. Since then, the Tuareg rebels and the Islamists have taken advantage of the uncertainty to attempt to seize control over the northern portion of the nation. Rebels burn Timbuktu tomb .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Wang Kang looks every bit what he is: a Chinese scholar. With his Confucian beard, graying hair and a deep, resonant voice enunciating Putonghua tones, he epitomizes gravitas. But it's not his appearance so much as the power of his story. For Wang is one of the few insiders who dare to speak publicly about something most people in China only whisper about: the fall of the man once touted as a potential Chinese president. ""I know I'm taking a little risk by agreeing to this interview,"" he says. ""Several foreign media have told me they cannot find one single person to speak in the vast city of Chongqing. No one dares go public. This is sad."" Why Bo scandal might not be all bad . All of this plays out in this choking metropolis in southwest China. It is a city Wang knows well. He is a well-known identity, plugged into local politics and personally familiar with the people at the center of this scandal, which has grown to encompass a murder investigation, allegations of spying, and rumored sexual affairs that have led to the sacking of the party chief, who until last month ruled the city with an iron fist. Wang says it all leads back to Bo Xilai, a man known in China as a ""princeling,"" the son of a communist revolutionary hero. Why the scandal plays bigger abroad . Bo saw Chongqing as the place to make his stand. He drove out criminal gangs, locking up or executing the ring-leaders. All of this to a soundtrack of old-style revolutionary songs and slogans: smash black, sing red he called it. On the streets he won praise, but to his critics Bo was orchestrating a naked power grab, wiping out rivals and enemies. The insider, Wang, says the crackdown went too far. ""Extortion of confessions through torture was commonplace -- too many unjust and mistaken cases were made in the process. That is for sure,"" he says. Bo fashioned himself on China's fabled leader Mao Zedong. Wang says Bo tried to recreate the Mao era and frightened communist reformers, making new enemies. ""He's been playing the role of Mao's successor,"" he opines. ""He was visiting PLA camps and giving the soldiers Mao's bust as a gift. ""None of the other politicians has ever done that. I think it has been a huge misjudgment of Bo. Going back to Mao's path is definitely not an option. That has proven to be a dead end. Mao led a road to ruin."" This particular path has lead to Bo's own ruin. His inner circle turned on itself. In February his police chief fled and sought asylum in a United States Consulate. Diplomatic, political and business sources now paint a picture of a man fearing for his life after linking Bo's own wife to the murder of a British businessman. Neil Heywood was a fixer. He linked British firms with Chinese companies. He even did some work for a firm run by former British spies. Heywood, who was married to a Chinese woman, then befriended Bo and his wife Gu Kailai. Somewhere it all allegedly went sour. Rumors now abound, each more sensational and lurid than the last, and equally hard to substantiate. But they are explosive: now police suspect Bo's wife had Heywood killed. ""It's said in the official report that Gu was involved in the murder of Heywood. As for her motive, I think it's either struggling over financial interests or disagreements related to their personal affair,"" Wang says. ""It somehow became impossible for Gu to end this relationship with Heywood. My guess is both factors exist. They were involved both financially and romantically."" Intimate relations, suspected murder, political intrigue: all of it leading to a hotel on the outskirts of Chongqing. CNN gained access and found a place well past its glory days. Stained walls and bedrooms with worn bedding and chipped furniture. But from this rundown hotel, to the corridors of the Great Hall of the People, the downfall of Bo and his wife is not just about a family in disgrace. Wang, the man who won't keep quiet, says China has glimpsed its future. On the one hand, a return to Mao's cultural revolution with Bo personally pushing a hard line rule. On the other, greater freedom and reform, a government more responsive to the people with protection for all under the law. One leader has fallen, but Wang says China may have taken big steps to saving itself in the process.","Wang Kang is personally familiar with the people at the center of the Bo Xilai scandal .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Telephones are ringing off the hook at this office in Mexico's capital, where a group of well-known activists are planning the final details of a protest on the other side of the Mexico-U.S. border. In a month-long Caravan of Peace across the United States, organizers say they will denounce what they believe are the devastating consequences of the fight against drug trafficking. San Diego, California, will be the first stop on Sunday for poet Javier Sicilia and 70 other members of Mexico's Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity on their trek through more than 20 cities in the United States. Along the way, 40 people whose family members are among the tens of thousands of dead and disappeared in Mexico's drug war will speak out about their experiences and work to create a new network with more than 70 U.S. nonprofit organizations. ""We want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests as much in the United States as in Mexico,"" says Sicilia, who became one of Mexico's most prominent activists after his son's slaying in March 2011. The caravan will stop in sites north of the border that the poet considers key -- including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago and New York -- before arriving in Washington on September 10. ""It will not be easy to cross the cultural divide to discuss subjects like drug legalization, the illegal production and sale of weapons, trafficking of migrants and money laundering,"" Sicilia says. And the protest's timing is another challenge, Sicilia says, noting that his group could struggle to gain attention during a fierce election campaign between incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama and his presumptive Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Still, he says he is confident that host organizations in the United States will help them create ""a narrative that can sensitize the U.S. population about these problems."" The tough political climate, the intense waves of heat sweeping the country this summer and the large distance to cover -- more than 5,800 miles (9,400 km) -- have inspired Sicilia to describe his upcoming journey across the United States as an ""odyssey."" For the mystical poet, who has become a key player criticizing Mexican President Felipe Calderon's strategy to fight organized crime, the caravan through the United States is the latest leg of a journey that began after his son's slaying. In March 2011, 24-year-old Juan Francisco Sicilia's lifeless body was found with six others, crammed inside a car outside the central Mexican city of Cuernavaca. Masking tape was wrapped around their skulls, faces, wrists and ankles. Authorities believe all seven victims suffocated to death, and they have accused local police of working with cartel members in the slayings. After his son's death, Sicilia said he would no longer write poetry. ""The world is no longer dignified enough for words. They are choking inside of us,"" he said at the time. While Sicilia stopped publishing poetry, words remain his weapon. The movement he leads surged to national prominence after thousands joined a three-day protest march culminating in Mexico City's central square in May 2011. Since then, the poet has led a series of high-profile protests uniting people from across Mexico to tell the story of the country's losses and show the faces of those who died, disappeared or were displaced because of the fight against organized crime. ""I think that our main accomplishment was to put victims in the center of politics, to say, 'These are not collateral damages. These are not statistics. They are human beings,' "" Sicilia says. While he brought together witness testimonials as thousands joined his caravan marches across Mexico, he also garnered attention from the country's top leaders. The movement has met with congressmen and senators, with Calderon and with the candidates who competed to succeed him. ""These are unprecedented things. They are seeds that are going to produce fruits at another moment,"" Sicilia says. But some of Sicilia's behavior -- like demanding the resignation of Mexico's top public security official, then changing his mind -- has raised eyebrows. Also, leading up to Mexico's presidential vote last month, Sicilia was criticized for saying he planned to cast a blank ballot. And for some, his poetic language has been difficult to interpret. ""I think that's because a lot of poetry is misinterpreted or simply isn't heard,"" Sicilia says. Since the movement began, in addition to protest marches across Mexico and meetings with top officials, there have been notable losses. Members of the movement protesting violence in Mexico have also become victims. In a three-month period last year, three members of the movement were killed. After these cumulative experiences, Sicilia says he feels deceived. Mexican officials have said that more than 47,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. But activists like Sicilia -- who is sharply critical of Calderon's drug war strategy and the president's approach to dealing with victims of violence -- say the death toll is far higher than government estimates. ""The politicians don't keep their word. They are overwhelmed by reality. On their agendas, the 70,000 dead do not exist. The war does not exist,"" Sicilia says. Even though Sicilia founded the movement and is its most identifiable face -- in 2011 he appeared as one of the protesters featured in Time magazine's person of the year edition -- he says he does not consider himself its leader. ""The best way to destroy a movement is to focus it on one figure and practically deify him. Through my mouth, I speak of the pain of this nation, but I am not (the nation),"" Sicilia says. Now, after more than a year of protests, Sicilia says this caravan could be his last. After the protest through the United States ends, the poet says he is considering returning to a spiritual retreat in France, where he spent time while his children were young. ""I want to go, look within myself, find my solitude ... and end the pain (I feel) for my son.""","A ""peace caravan"" aims to raise awareness about the drug war's consequences .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy stormed to his second major title on Sunday as he won the PGA Championship by eight shots at Kiawah Island in South Carolina and returned to the top of the world golf rankings. The Northern Irishman played 27 holes after coming back to the Ocean Course early to complete his third round, after which he had built a three-shot lead. And, in similar fashion to his eight-shot victory at last year's U.S. Open, the 23-year-old showed no nerves as he bounced back after struggling in the season's first three majors. He has won his two majors at a younger age than Tiger Woods did. It was the biggest winning margin since the tournament changed to a strokeplay format in 1958, eclipsing Jack Nicklaus' seven-shot victory 32 years ago. McIlroy broke the streak of 16 different winners in the past 16 majors as he followed his third-round 67 with a six-under-par 66, becoming the first player from his country to win the event. PGA Championship final leaderboard . ""It was a great round of golf -- I am speechless,"" he told reporters after becoming the fifth youngest player to win the PGA. ""The game-plan was just to play solid. I got off to a bit of a shaky start, but settled into it and I thought my putting today was phenomenal. ""I had a good feeling at the start, but I never imagined doing this. It means an awful lot to look at the names on that trophy and put mine alongside them."" His closest challenger was unheralded Englishman David Lynn, playing only his second major tournament nine years since his first at the British Open. The 38-year-old carded 68 for second outright on five-under 283, having started the final round in a tie for 10th place. Defending champion Keegan Bradley of the U.S. closed with 68 to tie for third with Sweden's Carl Petterson and Englishmen Justin Rose (66) and Ian Poulter (69). Poulter had reached seven under in his final round but bogeyed three holes in a row to fall away in his bid for a first major crown. Petterson had led for the first half of a tournament was hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms, but faltered with a third-round 72 and received a two-shot penalty in his opening hole of the decider. Can Rory follow in Tiger's footsteps? He found a water hazard and was then ruled to have illegally moved a leaf while making the stroke, and again finished with a par round. Woods must continue his four-year wait for a 15th major title after finishing tied for 11th, closing with 74 and 72. The American ended on 286 in a group including British Open runner-up Adam Scott of Australia, Masters champion Bubba Watson, 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell and fellow former major winners Geoff Ogilvy and Ben Curtis. Former PGA champions John Daly and Padraig Harrington were tied for 19th, while previous world No. 1 Luke Donald was equal 32nd. Veteran Vijay Singh could not keep up his strong form of the first half of the tournament as the 49-year-old Fijian closed with 77 to tie for 36th along with 1995 winner Phil Mickelson 36th alongside Woods' 2009 conqueror Y.E.

"(CNN) -- Roberto Mancini has finally secured Manchester City's first signing of the offseason just days before his side's English Premier League title defense gets underway after completing a $19 million move for Everton's Jack Rodwell. The Italian has been growing frustrated with City's inability to land his top transfer targets after reportedly becoming angry at the lack of progress being made by sporting director Brian Marwood. After leading City to their first league title since 1968, Mancini is keen to bolster his squad with the prize of the European Champions League now a top priority. City spent close to $785m in transfers over the past four years but has been virtually inactive during recent months while their rivals continue to buy. European champions Chelsea has spent $50m on Belgium midfielder Eden Hazard as well as $39m on Brazil midfielder Oscar. Arsenal has also been recruiting new talent with Lukas Podolski, Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla all joining since the end of last season, while Manchester United paid $26.6m for Dortmund's Shinji Kagawa. Mancini has been forced to watch on as City has failed to finalize deals for the likes of Arsenal's Robin van Persie, Roma's Daniele De Rossi, Liverpool's Daniel Agger and Swansea's Scott Sinclair. Manchester City win Premier League title in thrilling finale . City are keen for Mancini to trim the club's wage bill with both Emmanuel Adebayor and Roque Santa Cruz surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium. But the Italian has finally managed to complete one piece of business with the acquisition of England midfielder Rodwell on a five-year deal. The 21-year-old, who could eventually cost City $26m, is in contention to make his debut against newly-promoted Southampton on Sunday. ""Man City are a massive club, the league champions, so it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's a dream come true,"" Rodwell told told the club's official website. ""It will be an amazing experience to make my debut in front of them if I am selected to play next weekend. ""Obviously I knew the squad is immense with talent here but I believe in my ability. I've just got to work my way into the manager's plans and hopefully things will go well. ""The hard work starts today as I start to help contribute to the club winning more silverware. The season has started really well with the Community Shield win."" Big-spending Man City top Premier League value table . Rodwell graduated through the Everton youth system after joining the Merseyside club as a seven-year-old. He has already made two appearances for England and could win his third cap in Wednesday's international friendly match against World Cup finalists Italy in Berne -- a repeat of the recent Euro 2012 quarterfinal. Rodwell is the second big-name player to leave Goodison Park for City in the last three years following the departure of Joleon Lescott in a $34.5million deal back in 2009. ""It's been kept under wraps quite nicely,"" said Rodwell of the transfer. ""It's been going on for the past couple of weeks but the last couple of days it's progressed really quickly. I'm just pleased it's done. ""I would like to place on record my thanks to everyone at Everton. The manager David Moyes has been brilliant for me and helped make me the player that I am today."" ""I have a special relationship with the chairman, Bill Kenwright, who did not want me to leave."" Meanwhile, Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart will miss England's friendly against Italy on Wednesday with a back injury. Hart, who impressed during the recent European Championship Finals, is expected to be replaced by Team GB goalkeeper Jack Butland. Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chelsea's Daniel Sturridge have also withdrawn from the squad through injury.","Rodwell becomes City's first big signing of the summer after completing $19m deal .

"London (CNN) -- Manchester City won the English league title for the first time in 44 years to deny rivals Manchester United a 20th domestic championship in a gripping conclusion to the Premier League season. Defending champions United had looked on course to win the title after winning 1-0 at Sunderland thanks to Wayne Rooney's first-half effort, but City scored two remarkable stoppage-time goals to fashion an improbable 3-2 home victory against Queens Park Rangers. City had led the table on goal difference at the start of Sunday and Pablo Zabaleta's first-half goal suggested Roberto Mancini's side would comfortably win their first title since 1968. But a mistake by Joleon Lescott allowed Djibril Cisse to level and following a red card for QPR midfielder Joey Barton, Jamie Mackie popped up to head in the visitors' second goal to give United fans hope that their team might yet snatch the title from their city rivals. City bombarded the QPR penalty area and in stoppage time Edin Dzeko headed home to give their fans hope, before Sergio Aguero scored a stunning individual winner in a finale that no script writer would have dared pen. It was a goal that ensured City won the title on goal difference in the Premier League's 20th season, arguably the most dramatic finish in its history given it was decided in the last three minutes. ""To win it like this is incredible,"" Mancini, who at times during the second half gave the impression he could barely believe his side appeared to be doing all they could to throw away the title, told Sky Sports. ""I don't think I've ever seen a finale like this. ""We didn't deserve to lose, we had a lot of chances and we deserved to win the game and championship. ""It's fantastic for the club and the supporters after 44 years. It's been a crazy season and a crazy last minute."" In 1999 United won the Champions League final with two stoppage-time goals against Bayern Munich in Barcelona and Sunday's epic events bore parallel, though this time the Red Devils manager Sir Alex Ferguson had to suffer as victory was snatched away from him in those heart-palpitating final moments. ""I would like to say on behalf of Manchester United congratulations to our neighbors,"" said Ferguson. ""It's a fantastic achievement to win the Premier League. It's the hardest league in the world and anyone who wins it deserves it."" The rollercoaster game at the Eithad Stadium that wrung every ounce of emotion out of both City and QPR fans had consequences at the other end of the table given a Rangers defeat would have condemned them to relegation if Bolton Wanderers had beaten Stoke City away -- and at one stage Owen Coyle's side led 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium. But a 77th-minute Jonathan Walters goal earned Stoke a 2-2 draw to relegate Bolton to the Championship and allow QPR -- managed by former Manchester City manager Mark Hughes -- to stay up in the Premier League. Arsenal finished third after a 3-2 win at West Brom to secure their Champions League place, while north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur beat Fulham 2-0 to take fourth. Spurs will join Arsenal in the Champions League only if Chelsea lose to Bayern Munich in the European Cup final on May 19. Newcastle's hopes of a Champions League place evaporated after a 3-1 defeat at Everton, though Alan Pardew's team have the consolation of a Europa League place. It is estimated that Manchester City's owner Sheikh Mansour from the ruling family of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates has invested close to $1.6 billion in securing this Premier League title. The title gives City's owners huge kudos, though not necessarily immediate financial benefits. ""It should be remembered that there is a price of success, namely bonus payments to players and managers,"" financial blogger Kieron O'Connor, who writes the Swiss Ramble blog, told CNN. ""In fact, it is entirely possible that the net financial result might be negative for a direct comparison between finishing first or second, though it might be different if the comparison is against coming, say, sixth the previous season."" It is a title that City probably should have wrapped up a long time ago. At one stage in December after their barnstorming start to the season -- notably a 6-1 win over the defending champions at Old Trafford -- City were eight points of United after beating Norwich 5-1. However, a combination of Carlos Tevez going AWOL after falling out with Mancini, Yaya Toure's absence as he played for the Ivory Coast at the African Cup of Nations, David Silva's dip in form and Mario Balotelli's ill-disciplined antics allowed the defending champions to claw back that deficit and go eight points clear. But a disastrous April for United -- including a 1-0 defeat by City at the Eithad Stadium -- enabled Mancini's team to move top on goal difference going into the final round of matches. Sunday's games were broadcast to 211 countries around the world -- testament to the Premier League's global appeal. The remarkable end to the season could not have come at a better time for the league given it has recently announced the new tender for its next three-year broadcasting rights starting from the 2013-14 season. ""Games going down to the last game of the season will certainly increase interest and may in turn show the league as more valuable because of the unresolved title, Champions League and relegation issues,"" said lawyer Daniel Geey of Field Fisher Waterhouse. Sunday's 10 games also ensured this was the most prolific Premier League season ever with 1,066 goals, beating last season's record total of 1,063.","Premier League title decided in stoppage time of Manchester City's game with QPR .

"(CNN) -- The day after an internal review blasted Penn State for its handling of a child sex abuse scandal that implicated top administrators, including the school's iconic head football coach, the board of trustees made it clear that a lucrative deal the university made with Joe Paterno that now benefits his estate will still stand. ""Contracts are contracts,"" Board of Trustees Chair Karen Peetz said Friday during a trustee meeting in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""And no there's no plan to (change) that."" Renegotiations over Paterno's contract began with university officials in January 2011, according to a source, the same month that Paterno testified before a grand jury about what he knew of child sex abuse accusations against Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant coach on the football team. Ten months later, Sandusky was arrested. He was convicted last month of sexually abusing children over a 15-year period, with much of the abuse occurring on the Penn State campus. According to the university website, Paterno's amended contract was finalized in August 2011 and totaled $5.5 million in payouts and benefits, which included a $3 million bonus and title as head football coach emeritus if he retired at the end of the 2011 season. The package, which was published online in April, also included a $425,000 head coach bonus, $900,000 in television and radio revenue, $250,000 in debt forgiveness, use of the university's luxury box, use of the school's hydrotherapy equipment and $1,000 monthly payment to Paterno's wife for the rest of her life, among other benefits. Both former university President Graham Spanier and former Vice President Gary Schultz were involved in the renegotiation, while the board of trustees as a whole had been left out of the loop until November when Sandusky was arrested, a source told CNN. Spanier was fired after the grand jury presentment against Sandusky came to light while Schultz was charged along with former Athletics Director Tim Curley with lying to a grand jury and failure to report suspected child abuse. After being ""bombarded with hate mail and threatened with a defamation lawsuit"" following Paterno's firing over the scandal, the board eventually approved Paterno's new contract, according to The New York Times, which first reported the story. ""Board members who raised questions about whether the university ought to go forward with the payments were quickly shut down,"" the newspaper reported. CNN cannot independently confirm those accounts. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh released the results of the university-funded probe on Thursday, reporting that his team of investigators had found that several school officials had ""empowered"" Sandusky to continue his abuse. Paterno also could have stopped the attacks had he done more, Freeh concluded. ""Our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims by the most senior leaders at Penn State,"" Freeh wrote. The 267-page review implicated Spanier, Schultz and Curley in the scandal, but is separate from a government investigation into the charges of perjury and failure to report abuse against Schultz and Curley, whose attorneys blasted the report, calling it a ""lopsided document"" that did not have access to critical witnesses. Wick Sollers, a lawyer for the Paterno family, could not be immediately reached for comment Saturday. The former head coach died of lung cancer in January at the age of 85. On Saturday, a halo that had been painted above Paterno after he died was removed from a State College, Pennsylvania, mural titled ""Inspire."" Meanwhile, Sandusky is awaiting sentencing on his abuse convictions. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ross Levitt, Dominique Dodley and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","Contract negotiated amid grand jury testimony in the Sandusky scandal will stand .

"(CNN) -- NBC was pummeled by viewers who took to social media after the network cut away early from the closing ceremony of the London Games on Sunday to air a new television show, drawing outrage from those who tuned in for the highly anticipated musical spectacle. The Twitter-sphere exploded, with ""#NBCfail"" and ""#closingceremonies"" trending worldwide, after NBC cut out performances by Ray Davies, Kate Bush, The Who and Muse in favor of a commercial-free airing of ""Animal Practice."" ""I still don't understand, it's a tape delay, so can't you do the math in advance? Why do you need to cut off the closing ceremony? #nbcfail,"" Raj Sarkar wrote on Twitter. Meet the man who started #NBCFail . Actor Nate Barlow posted to his Twitter account: ""Why #nbcfail ranks last: no better way to turn people off a new show than to preempt @thewho & other rock legends for it."" The network was under fire for much of the 16 days of the Games by viewers who took to Twitter and Facebook to complain about its tape-delayed coverage of big-ticket events, which NBC has said was necessary to maximize its prime-time audience. Earlier in the Games, NBC came under fire for filing a complaint over tweets by Guy Adams, the Los Angeles-based journalist whose Twitter account was temporarily suspended after he criticized NBC for its Olympics coverage. In one tweet, Adams provided the company e-mail address of an NBC executive and urged followers to send him messages complaining about the tape-delayed coverage. NBC confirmed that it complained and Twitter suspended him, saying it is a violation of the site's terms of service to post personal information. It later withdrew the complaint. The network also came under fire for spoiling the results of U.S. swimmer Missy Franklin's gold medal-winning race when it ran a ""Today"" show promo that revealed the outcome of the race before it was telecast that night. The network relented in its opposition to streaming the closing ceremony live, though it offered an English-language pool feed rather than its edited program. NBC commentator Bob Costas appeared to acknowledge the issue with the network's tape-delayed coverage, saying during the broadcast that some of the challenges at the London Games would be eliminated at the Rio Games in 2016 because they will be held in a time zone only one hour ahead of Eastern Time. (The 2014 Winter Olympics, which will be televised in the U.S. by NBC, are in Sochi, Russia -- which is eight hours ahead of Eastern Time, four hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time.) Live or later: What's your ideal Olympics coverage? NBC did air The Who's performance at the closing ceremony in late night, following ""Animal Practice."" But that did little to calm the fury of viewers, many of whom said they tuned in to see the British band Muse perform the official song of the Olympics. ""Their broadcast was horrible! No Muse with the OFFICIAL song of the Olympics. Who made that call? @NBC #NBCfail,"" LoriAndJava wrote on Twitter. NBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision to cut away from the ceremony, though it did appear to warn viewers that it was about to end its Olympic coverage. ""And that's a wrap! Thanks for enjoying the 2012 #Olympics with us! RT if you CAN'T WAIT for #Sochi2014!,"" read a post that appeared on the NBC Olympics Twitter page as the closing ceremony aired on the East Coast. It also urged viewers to stay tuned for ""#TheWho after @AnimalPractice :)"" It posted a similar message on Facebook, which drew similar reactions. ""I tuned out when NBC interrupted the closing ceremony,"" John Kwon wrote. Earlier, NBC streamed the ceremony live on its Olympics website. At least those in attendance at the closing ceremony in London enjoyed the show. ""What an incredible night!

"(CNN) -- The United States named Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally Saturday, clearing the way for the two countries to maintain a defense and economic relationship even as American combat troops withdraw. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the designation during a surprise visit to Kabul. A day after the announcement, she will attend a gathering of international donors in Tokyo who will be asked to pledge financial support for Afghanistan after nearly all U.S.-led NATO troops pull out of the country by the end of 2014. The relationship is beneficial during the transition as both nations prepare for post-2014, according to Clinton. ""It will open the door to Afghanistan's military to have a greater capacity and broader kind of relationship with the United States, and particularly the United States military,"" Clinton told reporters in Kabul. By granting such ally status, it makes Afghanistan eligible to receive military training and assistance, including expediting the sales and leasing of military equipment long after NATO troops leave. ""There are a number of benefits that accrue to countries that have this designation,"" she said. ""They are able to have access to excess defense supplies, for example, and they can be part of certain kinds of training and capacity building."" Allegations: American generals delayed Kabul hospital abuse probe . The United States gave Afghanistan the designation as part of an Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in May by President Barack Obama and his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai. Afghanistan joins Japan, Pakistan, Egypt, Israel and Australia, among others, granted major non-NATO ally status by the United States. Unlike NATO allies of the United States, who are bound together by a joint defense pact, there is no mutual defense guarantee as a non-NATO ally. Clinton made it clear the United States has no intention of abandoning Afghanistan after the troops withdrawal. ""We will continue, of course, to protect Afghanistan from any efforts by insurgents and outsiders to destabilize Afghanistan,"" she said. Clinton and Karzai are headed to the meeting Sunday in Tokyo, where private and public donors are expected to pledge nearly $4 billion in aid for reconstruction. During the news conference, Clinton also hinted at thawing U.S.-Pakistani relations, which were virtually frozen after the killing of Osama bin Laden, U.S. claims that Pakistan failed to crackdown on insurgents conducting cross-border attacks in Afghanistan and Islamabad's demand that Washington apologize for the killing of 24 Pakistani soldiers in November 2011. Clinton apologized Tuesday for the killings, prompting Pakistan to allow trucks carrying supplies to NATO troops to cross from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the first time in seven months. ""We were struck by the recent call from Pakistan's parliament that Pakistani territory shall not be used for any kind of attacks on other countries, and all foreign fighters, if found, shall be expelled from Pakistani soil,"" Clinton said during the news conference. ""So we want to deepen our security cooperation with Pakistan."" Clinton said there would be a meeting on the ""ministerial level"" between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States at the Tokyo gathering. The United States has not publicly said how much money it will pledge, though Clinton said Saturday that ""of course the United States will be making a substantial commitment."" There are questions, though, about whether private and commercial donors will commit to large handouts without a guarantee that money won't be siphoned off by corruption rampant in Afghanistan. Clinton told reporters that she was ""encouraged by what she was hearing"" about financial pledges at the Tokyo meeting, but conceded corruption was a major challenge. Poverty and corruption are widespread in Afghanistan. It came in 172nd out of 187 countries in the United Nations' 2011 Human Development Index, which ranks nations based on life expectancy, education and living standards. Questions were raised after the United Nations announced an investigation in June into its Afghanistan development fund that pays the salaries of Afghan police amid allegations of misuse of funds. ""We take seriously any allegations of corruption that involve U.S. funds, and we are working with the United Nations to support the steps they have said they would take to address the concerns raised by donors about allegations of mismanagement of the Law and Order Trust Fund."" Clinton said ""mutual accountability would be discussed"" at the meeting in Tokyo. First NATO trucks move into Afghanistan from Pakistan after 7-month closure . CNN's Greg Seaby and Chelsea J.

"(CNN)  -- Just what we need out of Washington: More wind. But seriously, folks -- the White House took time out Tuesday to plug what it called a success story ahead of President Obama's State of the Union address. Citing a new report by the American Wind Energy Association, Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration's much-criticized economic stimulus bill turned what had been a projected decline in new wind electricity generation in 2009 to a sharp increase. Gibbs said the association predicted the amount of new electricity produced by wind turbines would dip by 50 percent in 2009, compared to the capacity added in 2008. ""Instead, this tax credit came through the Recovery Act, and we saw a 39 percent increase in the number of wind plants, wind power, generated over the course of last year,"" Gibbs said. Gibbs pointed to the administration's assistance to the renewable energy industry as an example of ""investments for the future."" Did Gibbs correctly characterize the report's findings? Yes. But while the industry credits the stimulus bill with spurring new growth in 2009, it says the new growth hasn't necessarily translated into new jobs. The industry did add nearly 10,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 2009, ""shattering any expectations we had for the year, given the financial crisis,"" said Elizabeth Salerno, the AWEA's director of industry data and analysis. Utilities had a strong first quarter of the year based on projects that were already in the works before the financial meltdown of 2008. But projects dried up quickly in mid-year, before about $1.9 billion in renewable energy tax credits from the stimulus bill began to kick in, Salerno said. Once the rules for qualifying for those credits were drafted, companies began using them to raise private capital and the year finished ""significantly stronger"" than expected, she said. ""That really is due to the Recovery Act."" Wind power produced about 1.6 percent of the electricity used in the United States though October 2009, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures. That's up from about 1.25 percent in all of 2008, and the final figure for 2009 is likely to be close to 2 percent, Salerno said. But while the wind projects produced new jobs for people installing and maintaining the new generating units, the stimulus funding ""doesn't necessarily translate to increases in manufacturing,"" Salerno said. ""Overall, we've had some gains and some losses,"" she said. ""I think we've been able to remain steady at about 85,000 jobs, which is about where we ended up at the end of 2008."" Salerno said the industry will be closely watching Obama's budget proposal, expected next week, for signs of continued support. ""Manufacturing needs a much longer time horizon to make investments,"" she said.

"Washington (CNN)  -- As the nation's top stimulus cop, Earl Devaney tracks whether the $787 billion in taxpayer money is being properly spent. He's not judging what it's spent on, but whether the money gets to where it should be by the proper procedures. And so far, things are generally going well, Devaney said in an exclusive interview to air tonight on CNN's ""Campbell Brown"". It's better than my worst nightmares,"" said the 62-year-old former football lineman, who now is chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, also known as the ""rat"" board, for its unofficial acronym. Known for straight talk in his nearly four decades of government work, Devaney is the head of a panel of inspectors general that keeps watch over government spending procedures for the stimulus plan. Created almost a year ago, the Recovery Act has come under criticism for both the kinds of projects funded and some well-publicized errors in the reporting process, including recipients of government funds who provided incorrect congressional districts or nonexistent ZIP codes. To Devaney, a former Secret Service agent, such criticism misses the bigger issue, the unprecedented transparency in government spending under the stimulus program. All contracts are recorded on a Web site set up by his panel, making information on where the stimulus money is going available to the public within weeks, he said. ""This is a huge effort in transparency,"" Devaney said, adding that people ""might not necessarily like"" the projects being funded, but at least they can see where the money goes. Such transparency is bound to encounter some human error, he said. ""Transparency in this case meant we were going to put that data up regardless of the errors that were in that data,"" Devaney said. He expressed surprise at the media focus on what he considered understandable mistakes. ""Every speech I gave, every comment I made, to any press person, I told them I expected to have data quality issues, and then when we had data quality issues, everybody acted surprised,"" Devaney said. ""That surprised me a little bit, that people were shocked and awed by the fact that American citizens, when they filed the reports, made mistakes. It didn't surprise me at all. And that's what transparency is all about."" Then there are the more significant problems. According to the panel's Web site, it has received 1,006 complaints, which have prompted 106 investigations so far, with 25 cases moving toward possible prosecution. Devaney said investigations so far have generally involved the wrong people receiving government money, such as someone previously deemed ineligible to do business with the government who opened a business under a different name. ""I'm pleased that I haven't seen as much fraud as I first might have imagined there to be,"" Devaney said. ""I think quite frankly, if you're going to go steal money, this wouldn't be the money you'd want to steal,"" he said. ""Too many eyes on it."" After 38 years in government work, Devaney had been looking forward to retiring and playing golf when he got a call last year from Vice President Joe Biden about heading the recovery panel, he said. Biden and President Obama asked him to lead it, and Devaney found it impossible to decline. At the same time, Devaney assured Biden that ""I would tell him not necessarily what he wanted to hear all the time, but what he needed to hear. And I would probably make him mad within the first six months."" Asked how that went, Devaney said,""I don't know if mad is the right word, but ... the vice president and I have had some interesting discussions."" Asked whether he thinks the stimulus program is working, Devaney said his response was based on the process, rather than politics. ""Would things be worse if the recovery money wasn't there? I think they would be,"" he said. For Devaney, it all comes down to helping people see how their tax dollars are being spent. ""Transparency can be ugly. And like I said before, the American people might not like seeing some of their money being spent certain ways,"" Devaney said. ""But they do have a right to see that.""

"(CNN) -- When we think about asylum, the picture that most people draw in their heads is of some persecuted person crossing a border to a safe country and pleading his or her case. Mexican journalists who have walked across international bridges into the United States, fearing drug cartel reprisals, come to mind. Or the Cuban athletes who during tournaments abroad decide to defect, and ask for asylum. This is the traditional, and most common way, to request asylum. But as the latest twist in the Julian Assange case shows, there are rare times when asylum is granted to someone who has yet to reach their safe haven. Ecuador's decision this week to grant asylum to Assange was celebrated as a victory by his supporters, but the WikiLeaks founder's conundrum remains unchanged. For the foreseeable future, he is stuck inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Ecuador may have granted asylum to the man inside their embassy, but the United Kingdom doesn't recognize it. At issue are divergent views on the concept of diplomatic asylum -- a nation's granting of asylum to someone not inside its territory. The concept of diplomatic asylum is as old as the practice of having permanent embassies in foreign countries. It is tied closely with the practice of diplomatic immunity, which is more well known. But controversies over countries using diplomatic asylum to protect people wanted for crimes led to the practice falling out of favor, according to a United Nations report devoted to the subject in 1975. From the 19th century onward, the practice of diplomatic asylum virtually disappeared in Europe, while it continued to grow in Latin America. The result is that today, the view in most of world is that diplomatic asylum, in essence, does not exist. The exception is Latin America, where some legal writers even grant diplomatic asylum the status of a human right, the U.N. report says. One last tidbit of academic dryness before considering the Assange case: The prevailing view that diplomatic asylum is not part of accepted international law was settled in a case between Peru and Colombia before the International Court of Justice in 1950. Victor de la Haya, a Peruvian, led an unsuccessful rebellion in Peru and was wanted by authorities there. He hid in the Colombian embassy in Lima and asked for, and received asylum from Colombia. Peru, however, refused to grant safe passage. Sound familiar? The court ruled that diplomatic asylum is not recognized unless treaties or other agreements are in place between countries. So today, ""in general international law there isn't actually a right to grant diplomatic asylum, or at least other states aren't required to respect it,"" said Matthew Happold, an international law expert at the University of Luxembourg. What it means for Assange is that Ecuador's declaration might not do anything to help him. In fact, Happold said, under international law, if the U.K. officially requests Ecuador to hand over Assange, Ecuador would be legally obligated to do so. Britain has made it clear that it will not provide safe passage and intends to extradite Assange to Sweden, but it is unclear if the government has sent a formal request for him. The U.K.'s position has been to negotiate a solution. A negotiated solution staved off a similar diplomatic drama between the United States and China this year. The blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng had escaped house arrest and sought refuge inside the U.S. embassy. Unlike the Assange case, however, Chen did not ask for asylum and none was granted. Instead, New York University invited Chen to study there, and China agreed to let him go. With negotiations apparently deadlocked between Ecuador and Britain, it is uncertain how long Assange will remain holed up inside the embassy while Sweden awaits to question him over claims of rape and sexual molestation. ""These cases can go on for years if there isn't some settlement. It's happened in the past,"" Happold said. The Peruvian who sought asylum from the Colombian embassy in 1950 lived there for five years. Meanwhile, some experts questioned the validity of the arguments that Ecuador used to grant asylum. Ecuador's decision was based on the belief that Sweden would eventually turn Assange over to the Americans, and that his life would be at risk once in U.S. custody, former Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Jose Alaya told CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol. ""That is making a hypothesis on top of a hypothesis, and to justify a decision on that is not very strong,"" he said. The purpose of an embassy is to maintain ties with other countries, but as long as Assange remains in limbo, ""every day it will become a greater obstacle in their efforts toward good relations.""","Ecuador granted asylum to Assange, but the U.K. does not recognize it .

"(CNN) -- For the first time since a reported massacre there, U.N. observers on Saturday entered the Syrian town of Tremseh, where opposition activists say more than 200 people were killed. The violence took place Thursday, on what may have been the single deadliest day in the 16-month crisis. It prompted a fresh round of condemnation from world leaders. In Tremseh, the U.N. team found evidence of an attack, including a burned school, damaged houses, and proof that artillery, mortars and small arms were used, said Sausan Ghosheh, spokeswoman for the head of the U.N. Supervising Mission in Syria. She added that the number of causalities remains unclear. ""The attack ... appeared targeted at specific groups and houses, mainly of army defectors and activists. There were pools of blood and blood spatters in rooms of several homes together with bullet cases,"" Ghosheh said in a statement. U.N. observers are expected to return to the town Sunday to continue their fact-finding work. Still grappling with the attack, Syrians endured yet another bloody day Saturday as regime forces fired from low-flying helicopters and a bomb exploded at a state security headquarters, opposition activists said. At least 73 people were killed in Saturday violence, including 20 in Homs, 11 in Damascus Suburbs and 13 in Hama province, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Fourteen additional deaths were reported in Deir Ezzor and 12 in Idlib, among others. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said a car bombing targeted a state security building in Hama, and ""a number of state security personnel were killed and wounded."" Syrian state-run TV said at least three civilians and a security officer were killed in Muhrada by a suicide bomber in a truck. Farther south, the Daraa province town of Khirbet Ghazaleh came under heavy shelling and machine gun fire after the Syrian army surrounded it with tanks, the LCC said. ""Helicopters fly over the city at a low altitude with a continued siege of the city and gunfire from snipers,"" the opposition network said. Meanwhile, Deir Ezzor was subject to intense shelling by government forces, as well as fierce clashes between regime forces and the Free Syrian Army, the LCC said. How long can al-Assad hang on? According to the opposition network, more than 200 villagers were killed in the Hama-area town of Tremseh on Thursday, and dozens more were killed elsewhere across the country. U.N. spokeswoman Ghosheh said a large patrol had been sent from Damascus to Tremseh on Saturday to assess the situation, amid widely differing accounts of what happened from opposition activists and the government. An initial reconnaissance mission was sent Friday following assurances of a cease-fire in the area, the spokeswoman said, but it was too late in the day to do much. ""The patrol assessed the situation -- if there was in fact a cease-fire and our access to the town,"" she said. ""An 11 vehicle integrated patrol, comprised of specialized military and civilian observers, arrived ... on Saturday after confirming that a cease-fire was in place."" International anger against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has ratcheted up since the Tremseh incident, with at least one U.S. official suggesting the need for more pressure on al-Assad's regime. As outrage grows in Syria, report of a 'breakthrough' for humanitarian aid . ""Through these repeated acts of violence against the Syrian people, President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead. It is time for him to go. It is time for the political transition that is long overdue to finally get under way,"" Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, told reporters Friday. ""It certainly does build strong international support ... to continue to ramp up the pressure on Assad,"" he added, citing ""ongoing conversations at the United Nations about additional ways that we can build some international agreement and raise the stakes even further."" Syria moving chemical weapons? Activists in the city of Hama, meanwhile, gave a grisly account of the assault in Tremseh. Witnesses inside the town told the activists by telephone that Syrian military forces had launched a full-scale attack against the opposition Free Syrian Army inside the town, which was surrounded by government tanks and artillery. As the government forces rained artillery rounds into the town, a number of village residents fled their houses, going into the streets, where many of them were shot dead by the government militias, the activists told CNN. The government painted a starkly different picture of Tremseh than that detailed by opposition groups. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for the violence. It said the government said residents called security forces for help after the terrorist groups raided the neighborhood. Regime forces arrested some of the members of the terrorist groups and confiscated their weapons, the government said. Syria's detached and deluded elite? ""Armed forces successfully dealt with the terrorists without casualties taking place among the citizens. They searched into the terrorists' dens where they found the dead bodies of a number of citizens who had been abducted and killed by the terrorist groups,"" SANA reported, citing a military source. CNN cannot independently verify reports from Syria because the nation has restricted access by international journalists. Meanwhile, many who survive the violence are caught in a precarious humanitarian situation. The chief U.N. organization that coordinates emergency aid warned Friday that more Syrians will die if contributing nations do not follow through and fund its relief operation. ""We have run out of language to describe how it is for the civilian population,"" said John Ging, operations director and chairman of the Syria Humanitarian Forum for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. ""It is physical and it is psychological.""

"Milwaukee (CNN) -- While there is a short-term and potential electoral edge in Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, it is politically risky and violates what should be the guiding principle in choosing a vice-presidential nominee: ""First, do no harm."" In the end, the choice may do more harm than good. The son of a lawyer, Ryan was born and raised in Janesville, a city in the southern Wisconsin. His working-class credentials include driving an Oscar Mayer wiener truck. Ryan's rise in state politics began improbably in 1998 when at the age of 28 he handily won the open seat contest for Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District in what was an otherwise disastrous year for the Republican Party. Opinion: Paul Ryan and Gen X GOP . There is no doubt that Ryan is charismatic, resilient and sharp. When he was a teenager, his father, like his grandfather and great-grandfather, died of a heart attack in his 50s. As a result, Ryan has shown a consistent dedication to physical health. In early mornings in Washington, he leads lawmakers through regimented workouts. The man is driven. His swift ascent in the nation's capital as one of the most promising young leaders of the GOP was cemented in part by his highly touted ""Path to Prosperity"" budget plan. But in his home state, it is not clear how much Wisconsinites know about him since he has never held statewide office. As Romney slightly trails Obama in Wisconsin, perhaps Ryan could improve Romney's chance of winning over the voters. A survey of Wisconsin voters from the middle of July tested the impact of adding Ryan to the ticket and found that doing so would cut a six-point Obama lead to just a one-point lead. It's hard to predict the overall statewide impact on Election Day. Wisconsin is not a solidly Democratic or Republican state; it is a sharply divided, very middle-of-the-road part of the country. Democratic candidates have carried Wisconsin â sometimes by the slimmest of margins â since 1988. Historically, it isn't clear that the choice of a vice president matters very much at all. It seems significant when the decision is made, but the top of the ticket is what voters care about. The things that make people like or dislike Romney â their own partisan and ideological predispositions, their perceptions of economic conditions, their level of satisfaction with the direction of the country â are likely to also determine how they feel about Ryan. The impact of the Ryan pick -- whether positive or negative as we will soon find out -- will only be worth a few points in either direction on the national stage. Given how close the election is, any major decisions made by either of the campaigns could be decisive. One of the upsides of the Ryan pick is that it changes the campaign narrative. Romney has been taking a beating in the last few weeks. He desperately needs to shift attention in a new direction. Since the choice of a conservative firebrand like Ryan will be viewed as a daring choice, Romney may see a temporary boost to his campaign. Unquestionably, Ryan will help Romney solidify support with staunch members of the GOP. Most of them would have supported Romney in the end regardless, but Romney wanted to assure them that he is reliable and ideologically aligned to the Republican base. Opinion: Ryan will shift the campaign dynamic . But a serious downside to a Romney-Ryan ticket may be Ryan's specific policy ideas. Widely lauded in conservative circles, Ryan's budget plan will become front and center in the campaign. This is especially true for the fundamental restructuring of Medicare as proposed in the plan. Medicare and Social Security are typically viewed as the ""third rail"" of American politics, and presidential candidates have historically shied away from proposing sweeping changes to these programs. By choosing Ryan, Romney all but guaranteed that these hot-button issues would become fodder for the Obama campaign, which will present a contrasting vision of entitlement programs for Americans. It's treacherous waters to step into. Romney has come clean about his conservative loyalties in selecting Ryan. It is worth keeping in mind, however, that this election will probably be determined by factors that have little to do with the vice presidential candidates. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas M. Holbrook.","Thomas Holbrook: It's not certain how much Paul Ryan can help Mitt Romney .

Though each of us may define ""happiness"" in different ways, it remains the case that we are inclined to see ourselves motoring happily toward professional success, fulfilling relationships, financial security and stable health. Unemployment, debt, Alzheimer's, any number of other regrettably common misfortunes are rarely factored into our projections. Watch Tali Sharot's TED Talk . According to most estimates, 80% of the population hold unrealistic, optimistic beliefs about their own future. However, ask people whether the economy is going in the right direction or how they feel about the future of their country, and you will hear: ""absolutely not"" and ""going down the drain."" TED.com: Dan Gilbert on our mistaken expectations . Collectively we are quite pessimistic about the direction of our nation or the ability of our leaders to improve education and reduce crime. But private optimism, about our personal future, remains incredibly resilient. Surveys show that most people overestimate their prospects for personal achievement, expect their children to be extraordinarily gifted and hugely underestimate their likelihood of divorce and cancer. What always puzzled me was how we manage to maintain optimism in the face of reality. We experience failure and heartache, we read the newspaper -- we know the economy is unstable, but still we remain optimistic about our own odds. As a neuroscientist I found this especially surprising, because according to all classic theories of learning when expectations are not met, we alter them. This should eventually lead to realism, not optimism. By scanning the brains of people while they learned from positive and negative information about the future we uncovered a possible answer to this puzzle. Surprisingly, when people learn of what the future may hold, their brains faithfully encode desirable information that can enhance optimism, but fail at incorporating unexpectedly bad information. (My fellow scientists and I were able to alter this tendency using transcranial magnetic stimulation -- watch the TED talk to see how.) When we learn of Oprah Winfrey's success story, our brain takes note and concludes that maybe, we too may become immensely rich one day. But when told the odds of divorce are almost 1 in 2 we take no notice. This means that warning signs such as those on cigarette packets may only have limited impact. ""Yes, smoking kills -- but mostly it kills the other guy."" But at the same when we hear the housing market is going up we think -- ""ohhhh the value of my house is going to double."" TED.com: Helen Fisher studies the brain in love . In fact, economists have suggested that optimism was a root cause of the financial downfall of 2008. The optimism bias was not only blurring the vision of the private sector, but also of government officials, rating agencies and financial analysts who constantly expected the market to go up and up. The belief that we are relatively immune to future harms can also put us at physical risk. Take for example an e-mail I received from a California firefighter who read my book about the optimism bias. He says fatality investigations involving firefighters often include statements to the effect of ""We didn't think the fire was going to do that"" even when all of the available information about risks was there to enable safe decisions. The British government for one has decided to try to address these problems. As a first step, it has acknowledged that the optimism bias causes individuals to underestimate the cost and duration of projects. Specific guidelines of how to correct for the optimism bias in appraisals were published in the British government's Green Book, which provides an overall methodology for economic assessment. Adjustments for the optimism bias have since been factored into the budget of many UK government projects, including most recently the 2012 London Olympics. Despite all these potential pitfalls, the science of optimism clearly indicates that, on balance, viewing the world through rose-tinted glasses is a good thing. We now know that underestimating the pain and difficulties the future undoubtedly holds lowers stress and anxiety, consequently enhancing physical and mental health. TED.com: Four lessons from robots about being human . Believing that a goal is within reach motivates us to act in a way that will help us attain it. This may, for instance, explain why optimists work longer hours and tend to earn more. Yes, the 2012 London Olympics budget had to be adjusted to account for over-optimistic prediction, but if the human spirit were not optimistic, would there be anyone around to participate in the actual Games? My guess is that the number of athletes who expect to win a medal at the Olympics significantly outnumbers the number of contestants who will mount the podium to be garlanded in due course. Most athletes subject themselves to years of intensive training because they can clearly envisage the end goal. At the end of the day, to make any kind of real progress we need to be able to imagine alternative realities -- better ones, and believe them to be possible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tali Sharot.","People tend not to anticipate the future perils that face them, Tali Sharot says .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration has warned a company that markets caffeine and vitamin B as ""breathable energy"" it could face regulatory action over ""false and misleading"" labeling. AeroShot comes in a lipstick-shaped dispenser that puffs out the white powdery mixture. Pre-filled devices can be purchased online or in convenience stores in New York and Boston for about $3. AeroShot's website says the product ""gives you a higher level of freedom and control that you can only get from airborne energy."" However, elsewhere it explains, ""the powder in AeroShot reaches your mouth where it is swallowed and ingested."" ""Your labeling is false and misleading because your product cannot be intended for both inhalation and ingestion,"" the FDA charges in a letter to the manufacturer Breathable Foods. ""Consumers may attempt to inhale your product, causing it to enter the lungs. FDA is concerned about the safety of any such use."" The AeroShot packaging says the product is ""not recommended for people ... under 18."" But the FDA noted that the AeroShot website refers to ""hitting the books"" and ""studying in the library"" as activities that presumably could be enhanced by using the product. ""These activities are commonly performed by children and adolescents,"" the letter says. ""Indeed, your reference to these activities seems to target this population."" The FDA also expressed concern over AeroShot's posting of news clips on its website that refer to the mixing of the product with alcohol as a party drug. ""Even though these news items express health concerns about taking AeroShot while drinking alcohol, your posting of the news items on the website where you promote and sell AeroShot publicizes such use,"" the letter states. ""We plan to work closely with the FDA to meet their requests for information and labeling changes to ensure compliance with dietary supplement requirements,"" Tom Hadfield, CEO of Breathable Foods, said in a statement. ""AeroShot delivers a mix of B vitamins and caffeine to the mouth for ingestion and is not 'inhaled' into the lungs. AeroShot is not recommended or marketed to persons under 18 or for use with alcohol."" The FDA is giving Breathable Foods 15 working days to respond to the warning letter. ""You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited above,"" the agency said in the letter. ""Failure to do so may result in regulatory action without further notice. Such action may include, but is not limited to, seizure or injunction."" In February, product inventor David Edwards told CNN it was safe and ""thoroughly tested"" before it was introduced. ""There are energy shots on the market that have 10 times the amount of caffeine in a single energy shot than we have in the AeroShot. ... The fact is we don't have that much caffeine in the product,"" he said. One AeroShot contains 100 milligrams of caffeine dispensed in three to six ""puffs."" ""For most healthy adults, moderate doses of caffeine -- 200mg to 300mg, or about two to four cups of brewed coffee a day -- aren't harmful,"" according to The Mayo Clinic. It warns that more than 500-600 milligrams daily can cause problems such as insomnia, elevated heart rate, muscle tremors and stomach upset. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, sent a letter in December urging the FDA to examine the safety and legality of AeroShot. ""The bottom line is this product asks more questions than we have answers, and to have it on our shelves before those questions are answered is a serious, serious, serious mistake,"" he said in a news conference in February. AeroShot falls under FDA regulations for dietary supplements. Those products include vitamin C pills, some weight loss products and certain energy drinks. The company making them is responsible ""for determining that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading,"" according to the FDA website. It's rare for the agency to prohibit a supplement. In 2004, it stopped the sale of the diet supplement Ephedra, but only after deaths and other serious side effects were reported.","AeroShot's labeling is ""false and misleading,"" FDA says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is a mathematical reason why the French Open is so different to any other of the Grand Slam tennis tournaments. Clay courts require a different type of game to grass and hard court surfaces . The Roland Garros tournament is currently being contested, with Rafael Nadal looking for his fifth win in a row, and world number two Roger Federer searching for his first ever French Open title. â¢ Get the latest French Open news . What has brought problems to Federer, and to other greats like Pete Sampras and Boris Becker -- who never won a French Open, is the clay surface on which it is contested. The maths of the clay surface are distinctly different to grass or hard-court surfaces. All officially recognized courts have a court pace rating (CPR), which rates the ""speed"" of the court -- and clay courts are at the bottom. The crushed-brick mixture that constitutes the base of a clay court produces a the highest bounce and most friction of the three surfaces, meaning they have the lowest CPR of all three surface types and are considered as the ""slowest"". Grass courts are generally have the highest CPR numbers, and are the ""fastest"" courts. The CPR numbers give a hint as to whether a ball will bounce higher or lower on a specific surface, and how much friction there is to either slow the ball or allow it to skid on. An example court pace rating for each surface may be 23 for a clay court, 35 for a hard court and 46 for a grass court. â¢ Try our special interactive to see how tennis ball bounce on different surfaces Â» . This number is calculated by considering both horizontal speed and vertical bounce of a tennis ball off a court. The equation used is CPR = SPR + 150 x (0.81-e). To make more sense of this, the International Tennis Federation, the game's law-makers, have produced a chart which simply matches the coefficient of friction (friction) and coefficient of restitution (bounce) to produce a court pace rating. But it's not just the bounce and speed of the ball off the clay surface that sets it apart from other courts, and makes the French Open an elusive tournament for some players. Head of women's tennis at Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), Nigel Sears, told CNN the slippery nature of the clay surface also set it apart from other types of court. ""The main factor that makes it different is that it's a loose surface. That allows players to slide on it."" The loose surface and different clay characteristics meant the crushed-brick surface required a different game plan, he said. ""Players are a lot further back on the clay surface. If you look at Nadal, his return of service points of contact are different to other surfaces ... on clay he can sit back."" The slower pace and higher bounce also meant big servers like Sampras were negated on clay and certain types of players were better suited to it, Sears said. ""Clay magnifies spin. So the slice is effective on clay ... and you can also produce a lot of top spin. One of the problems Federer has on clay is that he has a single-handed backhand, and Nadal can get so much spin -- so Federer is trying to hit single-handed shots up around his shoulder."" The clay approach was slightly different in women's tennis, however, as some players tended to approach clay matches similar to hard-court games, he said. Sears said endurance was also a crucial advantage on clay, particularly at Roland Garros. ""You tend to have longer rallies on clay. The French Open is so physical with five-set matches. When somebody faces Nadal to five sets no-one can compete with him physically,"" he said.","Clay, grass and hard tennis court surfaces all produce different bounces .

"(CNN) -- Mexico scored the quickest goal in Olympic football history to ensure five-time World Cup winners Brazil miss out yet again on an Olympic gold medal. It was one of two simple goals scored by Oribe Peralta which allowed the Mexicans to command a game which was littered with defensive errors by the Brazilians. Brazil could have pulled off a comeback when Hulk scored in injury time and Oscar missed the equalizer with seconds to go. Peralta's record-breaking first goal after just 29 seconds of play was an early example of what was to come. Brazil's defenders made the first of many poor clearances and the striker just accepted the ball outside the Brazilian area to shoot for goal in the bottom corner of the net with a low drive. The much-fancied Brazilians were in shock from the early setback and there was an altercation between Raphael and Juan after the goal as they tried to work out who was to blame for the error which allowed Mexico in. And they struggled to get the ball past a Mexican side happy to defend for the rest of the first period. The Brazilians had 60% of the the goalscoring opportunities, yet they failed to capitalize on every single one. Neymar put a number of shots over the bar and he was joined by attempts by Raphael. Live blog: Olympic final as it happened . Seven minutes into the second half, Brazil's Neymar crashed into the Mexican goalkeeper in the area, but British referee Mark Clattenburg rightly waved away calls for a penalty. The Mexicans seemed to be spurred on in the second half by a series of poor clearances and they fancied getting another goal. Tiago Silva failed to clear the ball from his area and, luckily for the Brazilians, Marco Fabian found it tough to control the ball and his looped shot hit the bar . Peralta looked set for his second goal when he saw off the final defender in the box and shot the ball into the net. However, he was ruled to be offside. He finally made the breakthrough minutes later. As a free kick came in, he had an easy header into the right hand side of the goal from the center of the area as the Brazilians stood like statues. However, in an example of how much the game meant to Brazil, they tried to fashion a last minute comeback and nearly pulled it off. Hulk broke free in injury time with a great low finish through the goalkeeper's legs to make it 2-1 to reignite Brazil's hopes of saving the game. Moments late Oscar had a golden opportunity to equalize but sent his header over the bar. A near capacity crowd 86,162 people came to see the Olympics final at London's Wembley Stadium. Whilst Peralta's first goal broke the Olympic record for the fastest goal, it was not the fastest seen at Wembley. That was scored by Paul Chow of English amateur soccer side Whitley Bay after 21 seconds in May 2010.","Defensive errors from Brazil allowed Mexican Oribe Peralta to score two easy goals .

"(CNN) -- South Florida? Sure, we all know about South Beach. The beach in Fort Lauderdale. The shopping in Palm Beach. But there are a hundred little surprises here as well. And you may not find them all in the guidebooks. The ghost of Trapper Nelson . ""Trapper"" Nelson (born Vincent Nostokovich) lived in the swamps and mangroves of the Loxahatchee, in northern Palm Beach County, from the 1930s until 1968. At 6-foot-4 and 240 well-sculpted pounds, he was called ""The Wild Man of the Loxahatchee."" He lived in a log cabin and ate only what he could kill. And he became a local legend. He even built a small zoo with the animals he captured, entertaining his occasional visitors by wrestling alligators. On July 24, 1968, an acquaintance found Trapper Nelson dead inside his cabin, with a shotgun hole in his belly. The circumstances of his death were never established. Some people, though, swear that Trapper Nelson's still there. Rose Watson, who knew him as a little girl, claims to have seen his ghost at least six times. ""I saw him clearly,"" she says. ""A big man, with the outline of the face I remembered from childhood. There's no doubt in my mind. It was as real as it could possibly be!"" Ranger-guided tours of Trapper Nelson's homestead are offered year-round at Jonathan Dickinson State Park. Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf Coast . A castle for lost love . In Latvia in the early 1900s, Edward Leedskalnin and Agnes Scuffs were engaged to be married. But Agnes called it off. Heartbroken, Ed emigrated to Homestead, south of Miami, where he spent the rest of his life creating a monument to the woman he loved. In 1923, Leedskalnin began carving a structure from the ubiquitous coral here. He didn't finish it until 1951. And when he was finished, Ed -- only 5 feet tall and 100 pounds -- had somehow transported and sculpted 1,100 tons of coral into an open-air ""castle"" for himself, Agnes and an imaginary child. When asked how he managed to move tons of coral, all Ed would say was that he was a student of the ancient laws of physics. His workshop was filled with pulleys and mechanical lifts, but no one saw how he did it. He once bought several tons of coral from a quarry. When the foreman asked how he intended to load the coral onto his truck, Ed requested privacy. A few minutes later, when the foreman came back, he was astonished to see Ed sitting in the truck with the coral fully loaded. Ed never gave up hope that Agnes would join him. But she never came. He died just weeks after finishing the castle. The Coral Castle Museum opens daily at 8 a.m. Adult admission is $15; children 7-12 get in for $7; no charge for children 6 and younger. 10 best motorcycle roads in the U.S. A huge sports memorabilia collection . In 1943, 4-year-old Joel Platt tossed a lit match into a gas tank at his uncle's car lot. The car exploded. And so, more or less, did little Joel. Joel spent the next year in a hospital bed. One night, he saw Babe Ruth in a dream. That was the start of his magnificent obsession. Today, Platt owns more than a million pieces of sports memorabilia, with an estimated value of $50 million to $100 million. And his Sports Immortals Museum in Boca Raton can only hold a fraction of it. Michael Heffner, president of Leland's Auction House, has called it ""the largest and most valuable collection of diverse and important sports artifacts ever assembled."" ""I cherish every piece,"" Platt says. ""But I cherish the stories behind each one just as much."" Admission is $10 for adults, $7 for children. The museum is at 6830 N.

The Monastery of St. Bernard de Clairvaux was completed in Spain in 1144 and occupied by monks for 700 years. It was eventually sold and turned into a stable. In 1925, newspaper magnate Randolph Hearst fell in love with the old monastery and purchased it. The building was dismantled, stone by stone. Each stone was then numbered, packed in hay and shipped to the United States. But because of a hoof-and-mouth outbreak in Spain, the Department of Agriculture ordered that the boxes be broken open and all the hay burned. But Hearst's workmen, unfortunately, failed to put the stones back in the right boxes. Hearst ran into financial trouble and was forced to sell the boxes. So they sat in a New York warehouse for 26 years until two Miami businessmen bought the boxes and shipped them here. It took 19 months to reassemble the monastery. Today, it's a green oasis of tranquility and Medieval architecture. St. Bernard de Clairvaux is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Regular admission is $8. The funkiest graveyard in America .

Call or e-mail for reservations. Japan in Delray Beach . In 1905, enterprising Japanese immigrant Joseph Sakei dreamed of creating a Japanese agricultural community in Delray Beach. He advertised in Japan for workers -- and for women to come and marry them. As the colony grew, it was named ""Yamato,"" in honor of a region in Japan. Life was hard, though, with stifling heat, disease, mosquitoes and crop blights. And most of the settlers returned to Japan. But a man named George Morikami built a good life here for his family. Morikami bequeathed his land to Palm Beach County upon his death, asking that the county create a museum and park about Japanese culture. Today it's one of South Florida's true cultural treasures. There are 200 acres filled with red wooden footbridges crossing ponds stocked with koi, sculpted bonsai plants, rock gardens, winding paths through the woods and small waterfalls. There's a Japanese villa, with blue-roofed rooms surrounding a central courtyard, filled with tea settings, ancient swords and ceremonial items. A museum was later added, with an authentic tea house and lakeside restaurant. In all, there are some 5,000 Japanese objects on display. Morikami Museum & Japanese Gardens is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and closed Monday. Admission is $13 for adults, $8 for children 6-17 and free for children 5 and younger.
