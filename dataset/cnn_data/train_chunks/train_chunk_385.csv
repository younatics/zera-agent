"(CNN)Dear World: Beyonce is actually not ""flawless."" Get over it. The posting of what appear to be unretouched photos of Beyonce poked the BeyHive (as her die-hard fans are known). In the photos Beyonce's skin is blemished and hardly the smooth, cover girl look usually presented. In other words, Beyonce is (gasp) human. But why should we even care? As Jacob Weisberg wrote in Slate: ""The most obvious explanation is that humans enjoy living vicariously through those of our species who are richer, more famous, attractive, and sexually desirable than the rest of us."" ""Whether couched in terms of envy, admiration, or derision, celebrity fascination begins as an exercise in imaging what it would be like to lead a more carefree and pleasurable life,"" he wrote. ""The flip side of the fantasy of irresponsible fabulosity is schadenfreude—the pleasure we take in the misfortune of others."" Which is why celeb watchers have by turns praised and derided the photos of Beyonce. A stunning woman, the singer is still attractive in the images. And yet there are those who question whether the photographs are even legitimate. Forget the birthers; the Beyoncers are not having it. The response to Bey-gate deviated from the cries of women's empowerment that followed a recently released image of supermodel Cindy Crawford from a 2013 photo shoot for Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America. The picture shows Crawford sporting imperfections, including cellulite. Fans rallied around the model and praised her for letting it all hang out, despite the fact that Crawford appears to have had nothing to do with the release of the picture. Her husband, Rande Gerber, posted a much more flattering Valentine's shot of his wife looking toned in a two-piece bathing suit -- seemingly in response to the hoopla. Not so fast says Isha Aran of Fusion. Aran finds the celebration of Crawford's ""empowering"" photo to be a bit disingenuous. ""For one, the standard that we commend the model for smashing with the unretouched photo is the very same standard we use to shame celebrities like Uma Thurman and Renée Zellweger for daring to change their looks,"" Aran wrote. ""The standard that equates beauty and dignity in the realm of aging. If a woman doesn't 'age gracefully' or if it's clear she's had 'work done,' accusations of weak character and 'clinging desperately to youth' are suddenly fair game."" Yes, that's really Uma Thurman . While ""Stars, they're just like us!"" may be a popular franchise for tabloids that also love to post features on celebs without makeup, it would appear that the famous are not allowed to actually be regular people. After all, regular people aren't as admired as celebs. ""Part of our curiosity is a way of learning what makes the great great in our own search for knowledge, fame and fortune,"" author Sheila Kohler wrote in a blog post about our fascination with celebrities for Psychology Today. ""We copy the famous, buy dresses that are similar or even the same, we wear our hair the way our idol does in an attempt to capture the glamor we admire."" But at least some fans are pleased with catching a less-refined glimpse of a star who is known for having a tightly controlled image and whose publicist reportedly once demanded that unflattering pictures of the artist from her Super Bowl half-time performance be removed.","Alleged unretouched photos of Beyonce caused a stir .

"My heart went out to Barb Dunn the moment her 16-year-old son, Daniel, answered my question. Once he gets his license in June, would he text and drive? That's what I asked during a kitchen table conversation in their Roxbury, New Jersey, home. As you can see in the video above, his answer was not the one his mom expected. ""I'm taking a deep breath,"" said Dunn, who recently purchased visor clips for Daniel's friends who have already gotten their licenses that say ""Stay alive. Don't text and drive."" ""I wouldn't even mind if he said, 'I'm at a red light and I picked up the phone for a minute to read something and put it back down,' but that moving and texting freaks me out. It's not acceptable."" Daniel's mom might have wanted to slam her head against the counter but still she told me she appreciated her son's candor and realized in that moment how difficult it is to persuade teens, who text nearly all day long, not to do it while behind the wheel. ""Even a well-meaning teen is going to have trouble saying no when they get that buzz"" from an incoming text or status update, said David Teater, senior director for the National Safety Council. ""It's almost a Pavlovian response."" Teater sadly knows all too well what can go wrong with distracted driving. Ten years ago, a 20-year-old woman who had been talking on a cell phone ran a red light and killed his then 12-year-old son, Joe. Since then, he's dedicated his life to raising awareness about the dangers of talking on a cell phone while behind the wheel. A newer concern: how to eliminate driving while texting. ""A technology solution is incredibly important. We need to take the temptation away from people before it happens,"" said Teater. A moving solution is at hand . But parents around the country might not realize that there is technology already available that can prevent a teenager from being able to text while behind the wheel. Aegis Mobility has created software that is installed directly onto a teen's smartphone, tablet or other handheld device. Once the teen starts driving about 10 miles an hour, the software automatically puts the device in safe mode, which prevents the teen from texting, e-mailing or browsing the Internet. The trouble, said company President and CEO Paul Zimmerman, is that a lot of parents don't know it exists. But he's trying to change that. Iowa is making the software available free of charge (it typically costs about $4 per month) to teens up to 17 as they apply to get their licenses at the Department of Motor Vehicles, said Zimmerman. Since Iowa signed on, many other states are showing interest, he said. Getting to teens as they get their license or as they are insured under their parents' plan is key, says Zimmerman, who is a father of two teens. ""Let's face it, most teenagers will not want this product voluntarily,"" he said. ""It is up to the parent."" And the impact could be wideranging. ""Literally, if our software is on 10,000 devices for more than two years, statistically, we will have saved a life,"" said Zimmerman. People are doing dangerous things out there . Another big challenge is convincing teens -- and adults for that matter -- that talking on a phone is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Teater says using a cell phone with either a handheld or hands-free device while driving results in a slower reaction time than if you were driving with a .08 blood alcohol level, the legal limit. Car crashes kill 100 people every day and are the leading cause of accidental deaths in the U.S., says Teater. Meanwhile, 90% of the crashes, he said, are caused by human error including drivers trying to do too many things at once. ""Do we want every single person out on the roadway driving around updating Facebook and closing business deals?"" Teater says while the vast majority of people no longer think it's responsible to use a cell phone while driving, there is still work to be done convincing people that talking on a phone hands-free can be just as dangerous. Simply put, our brains cannot handle two tasks at one moment -- the task of driving and the task of talking on the phone. ""You talk to any cognitive psychologist, they've known this for decades, that the human brain can only focus on one attention-requiring task at any given moment. The other task is always in the background,"" said Teater. He puts it in terms most drivers can understand: ""I ask them, 'Would you ever consider talking on the phone while you're reading a book?' And they say, 'Well, of course not, I'd never do that.' ... So if you'd never consider trying to read a book while talking on the phone, why would you drive while talking on the phone?'"" 'So many of the kids were crying' And why would you ever drink alcohol and get behind the wheel? That's the question Lisa Brodeur asked teens as she visited schools a few years ago with her three kids, including 27-year-old Kyle. Kyle became a quadriplegic after a drunken driver crashed into the family's car in 1997. Brodeur's husband was killed instantly. ""When I did school presentations, I put a student in a body cast, body jacket and a wheelchair. They were to sit and not move and try to be like Kyle for two hours,"" said the mom of three in Charlton, Massachusetts. ""So many of the kids were crying. They couldn't believe what Kyle has gone through,"" said Brodeur, who has battled survivor's guilt and physical ailments stemming from the crash. In her book ""A Mother's Journey,"" Brodeur tells the story of how she and her family have been forever impacted by the decision of one driver on a rainy November night more than 15 years ago. ""It is so important that our young teens and adults know what can happen if they drive impaired,"" said Brodeur. ""You don't want a life like my son's. So much pain and suffering, and 25 surgeries after and many more still to come."" An informational trip to a cemetery . Chris Blanchard, a father of two in Harbor Beach, Michigan, tried to drive that message home with a visit to a cemetery as soon as his teenage daughter and niece started driving. ""I had them drive in and stop and shut the car off to look around,"" said Blanchard in response to a request on CNN's Facebook page. ""At that moment, I gave them the concerned parent/uncle speech. 'This is it. If you screw up, not wearing (a) seat belt, drink and drive, text, get distracted by music or friends, it's over! No second chances, no excuses, no retakes, no do-overs, no goodbyes. Dead.'"" CNN iReport: Parents of teens share driving tips . ""My dad was a New York City fireman. He cut people out of cars. He warned my boyfriends,"" said Dunn, the mom of two from Roxbury, New Jersey. ""But he also opened his heart to me to show if anything ever happened to (me), what it would do to him."" Now she hopes Daniel gets that same message from her. How do you encourage your teens to be safe while driving?

"(CNN) -- President Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney offered competing views on how to keep America safe in back-to-back speeches Thursday. President Obama says he is trying to clean up ""a mess"" left behind by the Bush administration. Obama said his administration is trying to clean up ""a mess"" left behind by the Bush administration. He defended his plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, his ban on torture, the release of Bush-era interrogation memos and his objection to the release of prisoner photos. Cheney stood up for the Bush administration's security record, arguing that Obama has weakened the country's ability to combat al Qaeda and other extremists. He defended the use of enhanced interrogation techniques as a success that changed thousands of lives. He called the release of the Bush-era memos a reckless distraction and belittled Obama's decision to close Guantanamo ""with little deliberation and no plan."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's spokesman wrote off Cheney's address as something more beneficial to Democrats than Republicans. ""He is such a wildly unpopular figure trying to defend such discredited policies that Democrats would like to be able to find a way to pay him to give more of these kinds of speeches,"" Jim Manley said. In the past two months, the former vice president has become a frequent critic of the new administration in numerous national media interviews. But House Minority Leader John Boehner said Cheney's voice boosts his party's cause. ""Listen, Dick Cheney has been around this town for the last 35 years -- 40 years. He knows how this town works, and frankly, he's very knowledgeable when it comes to the strategies that the administration took with regard to dealing with this terrorist threat. And having him out there, outlining those strategies and why we're engaged in this, I think, is helpful to the debate,"" Boehner said. Republicans were quick to side with Cheney on Obama's plan to close Guantanamo, with Rep. Lamar Smith charging that the president should ""put Americans' safety ahead of an image problem he himself created by making a campaign promise to close Gitmo."" ""The administration asserts that transferring terrorists from a detention facility on an isolated island to a prison inside the U.S. will make Americans safer. The administration's claims are completely contrary to common sense. By the president's logic, we should close all other jails and prisons, too,"" Smith, R-Texas, said in a statement. Obama's plans to close the detention center have been met with opposition from both sides of the aisle in Congress. Following in the steps of House Democrats, Senate Democrats on Tuesday rejected the administration's request for $80 million to close the facility. They instead asked that Obama first submit a plan spelling out what the administration will do with the prisoners when it closes the prison. Both chambers of Congress also passed similar measures that would prevent the detainees from being transferred to the United States. Obama on Thursday pledged not to release any Guantanamo Bay detainees who threaten the United States. He also pointed out that no one has ever escaped from a federal ""supermax"" prison. Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado, whose district houses a supermax prison, adamantly does not want detainees brought to that prison. ""The president did not say where people would go who were convicted under military tribunals or who are to be released by courts or who are in the 'too dangerous to release' category, so his plan today really has a lot of gaps in it,"" he said. And Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said it would be ""dangerous, naive and a threat to America's national security"" to put detainees on U.S. soil. But Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said he thinks the U.S. can safely house terror detainees.  Watch Durbin's suggestions on how to handle the detainees » . ""The president is right in saying Guantanamo is more than a detention facility. It's become a symbol. And sadly, it's become an organizing tool around the world for terrorism. The sooner that we bring Guantanamo to a close, the better,"" he said. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, accused the president of continuing to ""to bow to world opinion"" when it comes to Guantanamo. ""Let me say emphatically: Mr. President, public safety comes before public relations. The American people don't want to know how closing Guantanamo Bay will make us more popular, they want to know how closing Guantanamo Bay will make us safer,"" he said. House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said closing the prison is ""too complex an issue to rush to resolution."" ""At the end of the day, when it comes to terrorism, no detail is too small, and we must have only one priority: the safety and security of the American people,"" he said. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said ""political rhetoric has entirely drowned out reason and reality"" in the debate over where to put the detainees. ""Our criminal justice system handles extremely dangerous criminals, and more than a few terrorists, and it does so safely and effectively. We try very dangerous people in our courts and hold very dangerous people in our jails in Vermont and throughout the country. We have the best justice system in the world,"" he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Obama's address as ""a sensible, balanced approach to the treatment of detainees and to the handling of state secrets."" One decision that pleased some conservatives was Obama's move to restart former President Bush's military commissions. Former Navy lawyer Charles Swift, who won a landmark Supreme Court ruling that knocked down the Bush administration's system of military commissions, said U.S. laws already cover the ""vast majority"" of cases the Obama administration will face. ""The previous administration sought ways around the law,"" he said. ""This president seeks to follow the law and keep us safe, and he believes in the long haul -- as do I -- that following the law and following our values in conjunction with holding terrorists is absolutely essential to both winning the war and being safe."" Swift said Cheney's defense of waterboarding ""mystifies me."" ""I want to ascribe to people the best of motives, and I presume that the former vice president believes for whatever reason that force is the only thing that works,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, that goes against all of the evidence."" As far as former President Bush's thoughts on the dueling speeches, he didn't watch them. A source close to Bush said the former president was traveling at the time, en route to New Mexico, where he is the keynote speaker Thursday night at a fundraising dinner for a scholarship program for students at Artesia High School.","Reid says Cheney's speech helps Democrats; Boehner says Cheney helps GOP .

"In the absence of a proper voters' roll and credible international observers, no one can honestly say with any degree of certainty whether last week's elections reflected the will of the Zimbabwean people. One thing is certain -- the numbers simply do not add up. And isn't it strange that there have been no jubilant celebrations by the ""winners?"" It's as though the Zanu-PF and Robert Mugabe, elected to yet another term as Zimbabwe's president, can't quite believe it themselves. The general mood across the nation is one of despondency. Everyone seems depressed. No one knows what to do next. It would seem the will of the people has not triumphed at all. Riot police patrol quiet streets. No one sings or dances. What happened on July 31 was a demonstration of what can be done by a small group of people who have everything to lose and who have spent more than 30 years cementing their grip on power and wealth. It certainly was not a popularity contest. Mercifully it was peaceful. Memories of the 2008 election -- burnt and lacerated bodies, weeping girls and women who had been raped, swollen, bleeding feet and dead bodies -- were fresh in the minds of many. LATEST: Western nations question Zimbabwe poll results . The Zanu-PF's ""victory"" must be considered in the light of the following: This is a country where 95% of the population is unemployed; an estimated 25% live and work in the diaspora to keep their relatives back home fed and at school; 15% are orphans (largely as a result of the AIDS pandemic). It is therefore pretty easy to buy people -- and votes. All those in the top echelons of the army, the police, the judiciary and the body responsible for elections are hand-picked, self-avowed Zanu-PF loyalists -- rewarded over the years via a well-orchestrated patronage system with land, farming implements, luxury vehicles, plasma TVs, diamonds and business opportunities. Robert Mugabe is a very wily politician. After losing the election in 2008, he and his generals threw everything into this election -- determined to win at all costs. They left nothing to chance. They also enlisted the help of the controversial Israeli company Nikuv, which has been accused of manipulating the vote in Zambia during the last election. The Registrar General's office was used to disenfranchise young people mainly in the urban areas, and to overstate the number of old people in rural areas over 80. According to their own figures, the RG registered just 8% of those in the 18-19 age group -- and 220% of those in the over-80 age group, according to analysis by the The Research and Advocacy Unit, an NGO based in Harare. Younger people tend to vote for the MDC, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe's main rival, and older people for the long-time president's Zanu-PF party. The office also disenfranchised millions of people in the diaspora, despite having signed up to the Southern African Development Community election guidelines, which stipulate that provisions should be made for those in the diaspora to vote. A chaotic registration process registered just 1.8 million voters in the urban areas that are a stronghold for Tsvangirai's MDC, many of whom spent days queuing up to vote. Hundreds of thousands were disenfranchised -- either their names had been removed completely from voter rolls, or they appeared in a different ward or even a different constituency. The voter's roll was only made available to parties other than Zanu-PF on the eve of the election after a High Court injunction had been granted, which meant that other parties did not have the time to raise the alarm about the myriad irregularities. Neither could people check that their names were on the list, and in the right place. This caused enormous confusion on the day and many would-be voters simply gave up. The opposition MDC party and civil observers have documented thousands of examples of impossible numbers related to the election. In the rural area of Uzumba, for instance, 21,000 people allegedly voted in 12 hours at 15 polling stations -- that's one voter every two seconds. No village in Zimbabwe has that many adults, and the process of finding one's name on the list, dipping a finger in the special ink and placing one's X next to a candidate would clearly take longer than 120 seconds. There was documented evidence of Zanu-PF bussing rural people into urban areas to vote. Although their names did not appear on the roll, they had voting slips produced by the registrar's office which allowed them to cast their votes. It is believed that this is what led to the MDC losing most of its urban seats. Zanu-PF covertly continued to enroll more voters right up until the eve of the poll, after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission refused to extend the registration days. The African Union and SADC observers brushed this off as inconsequential. Matabeleland province consistently voted for Tsvangirai in the past, yet in this election Mugabe made almost a clean sweep. These are people who hate Zanu-PF -- people who have bitter memories of the Gukurahundi genocide allegedly perpetrated by Mugabe's men in the early 1980s. It is inconceivable that they would vote en masse for Zanu-PF. Intimidation also played a huge role in the contest. In the weeks leading up to the election, and even as early as January when Mugabe first started agitating for elections to take place, The Zimbabwean and other independent media were inundated with reports from all over the country of threats by Zanu-PF's traditional leaders, youth militia, army and police officers of a repeat of the 2008 violence if the party and Mugabe did not win. There is, of course, some support for Mugabe in the rural areas, where he has given hundreds of thousands of families land, agricultural inputs and food -- which was given as humanitarian aid by the international community and re-bagged and distributed in Mugabe's name strictly to Zanu-PF members during the past 15 years. Many families were threatened with the loss of their land and homes if Zanu-PF did not win in their area. Police officers and their families were warned that they would lose their homes if Mugabe did not win the election. Add to this the tight control by Zanu-PF of the mass media the constant demonization of Morgan Tsvangirai, his MDC party and Western sanctions, and the exhaustion of a populace ground down by decades of poverty, lack of access to independent information, violence and the threat of violence -- and you begin to understand the toxic recipe for a Zanu-PF ""success"" at the polls. The MDC also failed Zimbabweans on several counts during the five years since they won the election but were forced by the SADC into a power-""sharing"" coalition with Zanu-PF. These failures included Tsvangirai's indiscretions after his wife died, corruption in urban councils controlled by the party, failure to bring meaningful legislative change through parliament and greed on the part of some MPs who sided with Zanu-PF in pursuit of more pay and perks. I doubt there will be any serious violence now. People are shell-shocked and Mugabe's loyal forces are well prepared with Chinese weapons and Israeli water cannons.  Riot squads are out in full force. Tsvingirai's options are limited. He seems inclined to appeal to the Constitutional Court for a nullification and a re-run. But it is highly unlikely that judgement would go in his favour given the compromised nature of the judiciary. Just a few weeks before the election, Mugabe packed the courts with hand-picked loyalists. The MDC could appeal to the SADC to nullify the result. But this is also unlikely to succeed given that the SADC and the AU have already endorsed the results. Passive resistance in a country where 95% of people are unemployed is a non-starter. Any other resistance would be met with greater force and give Mugabe the chance he is waiting for -- to lock up all MDC leaders.","Robert Mugabe declared winner of Zimbabwe election: Opposition disputes result .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney says documents released Monday support his view that harsh interrogation techniques used on terrorism suspects prevented attacks and yielded crucial information about al Qaeda. Former Vice President Dick Cheney disagrees with a federal investigation of harsh CIA interrogations. Cheney also criticized the Obama administration's decision to ask a federal prosecutor to determine whether U.S. intelligence agents violated the law in interrogations that some have equated to torture. ""The documents released Monday clearly demonstrated that the individuals subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided the bulk of intelligence we gained about al Qaeda,"" Cheney said in a written statement. ""This intelligence saved lives and prevented terrorist attacks."" The former vice president spoke after the federal government released hundreds of pages of documents Monday related to the CIA interrogations of terrorism suspects. The government released a 2004 report from the CIA inspector general as well as other documents in which the CIA described information that it had obtained by interrogating terrorism suspects -- those are the documents to which Cheney referred in his statement. The 2004 inspector general's report says that in an effort to get the men to talk, U.S. interrogators threatened a captured al Qaeda operative with a power drill and threatened to kill another top captive's children. That 2004 report was released as a result of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The report also outlines the use of multiple unauthorized interrogation methods on suspected terrorists, including threats, ""blowing cigar smoke, employing certain stress positions, the use of a stiff brush on a detainee, and stepping on a detainee's ankle shackles."" Interrogators staged mock executions -- which are banned by the U.N. Convention Against Torture -- to try to frighten detainees into talking, the report says. In one instance, a gun was fired in a room next to the one in which a suspect was being questioned so he would think another prisoner was being killed. CIA Director Leon Panetta called much of what was in the report ""an old story,"" and the White House said President Obama still prefers ""to look forward, not back"" when it comes to the treatment of suspected terrorists. But Attorney General Eric Holder has asked a federal prosecutor to examine whether the interrogations violated the law, and the White House said Obama will leave any decision on charges to the Justice Department. And the Obama administration announced it would put the FBI in charge of a special unit set up to question suspected terrorists under White House oversight. Cheney criticized those changes, saying Obama's decision to let the Justice Department ""investigate and possibly prosecute CIA personnel ... serves as a reminder ... of why so many Americans have doubts about this administration's ability to be responsible for our nation's security."" The former vice president pointed to CIA documents, released Monday, that say many captured al Qaeda suspects provided information that led to the arrest of other terrorism suspects. ""The activities of the CIA in carrying out the policies of the Bush administration were directly responsible for defeating all efforts by al Qaeda to launch further mass-casualty attacks against the United States,"" Cheney said. Holder has said the Justice Department would not prosecute intelligence officers that followed legal guidance from the administration ""in good faith."" But he said Monday that after reviewing the inspector general's report and an internal Justice Department review, he has asked federal prosecutor John Durham to lead a preliminary investigation into the interrogations featured in the documents. Durham was appointed in 2008 by Holder's predecessor, Michael Mukasey, to investigate the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes, and Holder's decision broadens his investigation. But in a written statement, Panetta said Monday's report is ""in many ways an old story."" ""The outlines of prior interrogation practices, and many of the details, are public already,"" he said. ""The use of enhanced interrogation techniques, begun when our country was responding to the horrors of September 11th, ended in January. For the CIA now, the challenge is not the battles of yesterday, but those of today and tomorrow."" As the inspector general's report was coming out, the Obama administration announced that it had created a new High Value Detainee Interrogation Group that will handle the questioning of high-level prisoners. It will be led by the FBI and will be restricted to using techniques outlined in the Army Field Manual on interrogations, which senior administration officials said provides ""adequate and effective means"" of questioning. ""The new policies proposed by the task force will allow us to draw the best personnel from across the government to conduct interrogations that will yield valuable intelligence and strengthen our national security,"" Holder said in a written statement. ""There is no tension between strengthening our national security and meeting our commitment to the rule of law, and these new policies will accomplish both."" Two former CIA operatives welcomed that news, telling CNN that the spy agency got into the business of questioning prisoners only after al Qaeda's attacks on New York and Washington. Gary Berntsen, a former CIA agent who served in Afghanistan during the U.S. invasion that followed 9/11, said questioning prisoners was ""a distraction"" for the spy agency. ""I didn't think we should be in the business of doing that,"" Berntsen said. ""Later, the FBI did end up in that business. Unfortunately, this has been a problem."" And Robert Baer, a former CIA officer who served in several Middle Eastern countries, said the FBI interrogates people ""for a living."" ""They're very good at it. They're very good at making sure they don't cross the boundary lines,"" Baer said. ""The CIA traditionally has gone out and recruited sources, not through coercion, and you know, it does very well when it does that."" According to the inspector general's report and officials familiar with its contents, the drill and a gun were used to threaten Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the suspected plotter of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, while interrogators told accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that ""if anything else happens in the United States, we're going to kill your children."" In the incident in which a gun was fired in the next room, the report states, ""When the guards moved the detainee from the interrogation room, they passed a guard who was dressed as a hooded detainee, lying motionless on the ground, and made to appear as if he had been shot."" CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano would comment on specifics of the inspector general's report, but said all the incidents described in it have already been reviewed by prosecutors. ""The CIA in no way endorsed behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance. This has all been looked at. ... That's how the system was supposed to work, and that's how it did work,"" Gimigliano said. A former intelligence official who is familiar with the report said that while it ""reaffirmed"" the interrogation program, it ""also showed some had strayed off center."" The official said that when CIA leadership found out about the drill incident, they were ""angry as hell"" and called it ""nickel-and-dime foolishness"" that was not tolerated. The individual who used the drill was pulled from the program and ""sharply reprimanded,"" the official said. The interrogations took place in the CIA's secret prisons before 2006, when then-President George W. Bush moved all detainees from such facilities to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba. The Bush administration has previously acknowledged that it authorized what it called ""enhanced"" interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists there, arguing they produced valuable intelligence without violating U.S. laws banning torture. Critics say some of the techniques that had been authorized -- such as the use of waterboarding against al-Nashiri, Mohammed and fellow al Qaeda captive Abu Zubayda -- clearly violated international law.

"Njideka Akunyili started college planning to be a doctor, but left as an artist and is now billed as one of New York's most promising new talents. The 29-year-old Nigerian-born artist has just completed a year-long residence with the prestigious Studio Harlem in New York. All five of her works sold in the first half hour of this year's Art Basel, the world's top fair for modern and contemporary art and African style magazine Arise described her as ""fast becoming the art world's newest star."" Akunyili was born and brought up in the small town of New Haven in Enugu, Nigeria, and moved to the United States for college at the age of 16. Her work, a combination of drawing, painting, printmaking and collage, combines Nigerian and American culture. ""Nigeria is almost a third character in my work,"" she said. ""A lot of my work is about investigating my love for Nigeria and my life in America. ""I met my husband at college and there was some anxiety that if I married outside my culture I would lose my identity, but there is a space in my work where these things come together."" Akunyili is hoping to help change attitudes to art in Nigeria, where she said appreciation is growing slowly. ""If I hadn't left Nigeria, I wouldn't be an artist, I would be a doctor,"" she said. ""When I told my parents I wanted to be an artist, they couldn't get their heads around why an educated person who went to college in America would want to be an artist. ""If people think of artists, it's somebody by the side of the road painting signs."" Also on Inside Africa: Arise magazine: Africa's fashion bible . She said many new Nigerian artists were successful internationally, but few were well known within the country. ""However, there is a new crop of creative Nigerians who are changing this and others will follow,"" she said. ""I want to be part of that change."" She said the country had seen a ""cultural explosion"" in the last 10 years in music, fashion, film and other creative industries. See hi-res gallery of Akunyili's images . ""When I was young, the less Nigerian you were the cooler you were, but now we have gone back to tradition,"" said Akunyili. ""There's a nice energy about the country that's finally coming into its own."" Several of Akunyili's works include images of a black woman and a white man -- dancing in a nightclub, in bed together and in a traditional Igbo wedding ceremony. Another shows a party at a neighbor's house in the Nigerian town where Akunyili grew up. Read related: The African sculptures mistaken for lost Atlantis . Akunyili won her residency immediately after graduating with a Masters of Fine Art from Yale University. She said: ""I noticed a lot of artists I like had done a residency at Studio Harlem, and I thought this couldn't be a coincidence. I felt something really good was happening there. ""If I had a list of all the things I wanted, this residency was at the top. ""I applied towards the end of my year at Yale, but I didn't think I would get it because it was very competitive and a lot of people apply several times. ""I thought if it takes three times on average, I should start collecting my rejection letters. I was very surprised to get it first time."" The residency ended with a four-month exhibition, ""Primary Sources,"" featuring Akunyili's work alongside that of the two other Artists In Residence, Meleko Mokgosi and Xaviera Simmons. Also on Inside Africa: Leisure time in Lagos . ""Getting the residency was a big game changer for me,"" said Akunyili. ""I have friends who graduated with me who have made little or no work because they are working other jobs to pay the rent. ""The residency puts you on a platform for people to write about and talk about, and also puts you in touch with a lot of other artists. ""The show at the end is four months, and it's allowed far more people to see my work than I ever thought would. ""Now it's over I want to try and continue with the rigor of being in a studio every day."" Akunyili's work has not yet been shown in her own country, something she would like to change soon. ""I want people to see that art is something you can do with your life,"" she said.","Njideka Akunyili has just completed a year-long residency at Studio Harlem, New York .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama says Osama bin Laden had a group of supporters within Pakistan helping to keep the al Qaeda leader secure for years, despite an American-led international manhunt that extended for nearly a decade with Islamabad's ostensible support. Top U.S. officials insist Pakistan remains a critical U.S. ally in the fight against terrorism, but are demanding answers to troubling questions about bin Laden's presence in that country over the course of the last six years. ""We think that there had to be some sort of support network for bin Laden inside of Pakistan,"" Obama said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview airing Sunday on CBS.  ""But we don't know who or what that support network was."" The president said U.S. officials ""don't know whether there might have been some people inside of government (or) people outside of government, and that's something that we have to investigate."" ""More importantly,"" he added, ""the Pakistani government has to investigate."" Pakistani authorities have ""indicated they have a profound interest in finding out what kinds of support networks bin Laden might have had,"" Obama noted. ""But these are questions that we're not going to be able to answer"" immediately after the raid on bin Laden's compound. ""It's going to take some time for us to be able to exploit the intelligence that we were able to gather on site,"" he said. Pakistani leaders insist they didn't take part in either the establishment or the maintenance of bin Laden's safe haven, and have promised a full examination of the circumstances that allowed him to spend years in Abbottabad, a city with a heavy military presence located a mere 30 miles north of the country's capital. Asked by CNN's Fareed Zakaria whether bin Laden's presence in Pakistan could be chalked up to ""duplicity or incompetence,"" Pakistan's U.S. ambassador, Husain Haqqani, said Sunday he couldn't provide an explanation. ""I think the best way to move forward is to wait for the findings of an internal (investigation) -- a look at the issue,"" Haqqani said.  ""I do not think that speculation is going to solve any problem."" Pakistan's government ""did not have a policy of protecting these people,"" he asserted during an interview on ABC's ""This Week."" Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, told CNN's Candy Crowley he has not seen any information to indicate Pakistani officials knew bin Laden was living in Abbottabad. But if evidence is discovered that is ""highly disturbing, we'll certainly press that,"" he said. Donilon's comments came amid calls in Congress and elsewhere to cut U.S. financial assistance in Pakistan, which currently receives roughly $1.5 billion in annual aid. Last week, CIA Director Leon Panetta -- nominated by Obama to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary -- told House members during a closed-door briefing that Pakistan was ""either involved or incompetent,"" according to two sources in attendance. ""We'll clearly be working with (Pakistani authorities) to understand how we got to this point,"" Donilon said.  He stressed, however, that ""more terrorists and extremists have been captured or killed (in Pakistan) than any other place in the world."" ""We need to look at this in a calm and cool way,"" he said.  There is a lot ""at stake in that region."" ""Questions are being raised quite aggressively in Pakistan,"" Donilon later added on ABC's ""This Week.""  Authorities there ""need to do an investigation."" Indiana's Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN it seems ""very logical"" that ""a lot of people in Pakistan knew about (bin Laden's) whereabouts."" But Lugar dismissed calls to cut Pakistan's financial aid.  Like Donilon, he stressed the reality that Pakistan remains a ""critical factor in the war against terror."" Among other things, Lugar highlighted the importance of keeping Islamabad's nuclear arsenal secure, and out of the hands of Islamic or other extremists. Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, the chairman of the committee, expressed optimism that the uproar over bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad will allow American and Pakistani leaders to ""punch a reset button"" in their relationship. ""Hopefully (now) there can be a readjustment,"" he said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""  Kerry noted Pakistan's past assistance in the U.S. fight against terrorism, including its willingness to allow U.S. predator drone strikes within its borders. Former Bush CIA Director Michael Hayden appeared to agree with Kerry's assessment of the situation created by the raid. ""This may be an opportunity to reboot this relationship with Pakistan, and get them to be more aggressive in going after these common targets,"" Hayden said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Even if Pakistan was not complicit in providing the safe haven"" to bin Laden, ""they certainly fell well short of what it was we thought or perhaps they think they should be,"" he said. Haqqani said on ""This Week"" that Islamabad would have taken action if any member of the Pakistani civilian government, military, or intelligence service knew bin Laden's location. He conceded there had been a failure on the part of his government, and said an investigation is already ongoing. ""Heads will roll"" once it's completed, Haqqani promised.  The investigation ""will lead wherever it will lead."" Pakistan ""wants to put to rest any misgivings the world has about our role"" in the fight against terrorism, he said. As part of that effort, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik met with a number of senior Saudi officials over the weekend, including King Abdullah.  The officials discussed, among other things, the changing security situation after the U.S. raid on bin Laden's compound. Pakistan's prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, is expected to deliver a new terrorism-related policy statement Monday as the Pakistani parliament opens a debate on the U.S. raid. During his appearance on ABC, Haqqani acknowledged deep social and political divisions in his country.  Pakistan remains a hotbed of anti-U.S. sentiment and is home to a large number of people with sympathy for bin Laden.  ""Jihadi has-beens"" are ""still alive and kicking,"" he said. At the same time, however, he noted the substantial time and resources Washington has devoted to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- countries many analysts see as less critical fronts in the war against al Qaeda and similar organizations.  He also blasted the U.S. government's willingness to conduct a raid in Pakistan without Islamabad's awareness or consent. ""What we are offended by is the violation of our sovereignty,"" he said.  ""America has a selling job to do in Pakistan."" Later, Haqqani told CNN that Washington needs to do more to acknowledge Pakistan's contributions in the war against al Qaeda and other terrorist elements. The United States needs ""to show respect ... for what Pakistan has done,"" he said.  ""Pakistan has sacrificed thousands of lives in fighting terrorism."" Haqqani criticized what he characterized as ""a strange mood"" in Washington.  ""Every time something goes wrong with Pakistan, there is open season on Pakistan,"" he said. The relationship between Washington and Islamabad is ""based on mutual need,"" he said.  ""Constantly bashing us"" doesn't help the situation.

"Last night, a video emerged of the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff, at the hands of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's ISIS, the extreme jihadist group that has illegitimately declared the establishment of a militant ""caliphate"" in Syria and Iraq. This latest execution video follows that of a similar crime committed against another U.S. journalist, James Foley, a fortnight ago. Like the first ""Message to America,"" this latest video ended with the executioner threatening to behead another captive non-combatant, this time a Briton. First and foremost, it is imperative that we do not allow the traction that these videos have gained in the West to eclipse ISIS's other inhumane actions. In years gone by, ISIS -- which refers to itself as the Islamic State -- and its forebears have consistently and persistently committed the most atrocious of war crimes against communities in the Middle East. In the last month alone, it has been held responsible for attempting a genocide against the Yazidi minority sect, as well as the extermination of the Turkmen Shia Muslims of Amerli. These come on top of the wholesale massacre it committed against the Sunni peoples of the Shu'aytat tribe in East Syria in August, as well as countless other summary executions of people it deems to be its enemies. We must not be fooled into thinking that ISIS only beheads its Western captives; last week, a Kurdish man - unarmed, of course - was executed in front of a mosque in Mosul in a video entitled ""A message written in blood."" But because it was directed at the president of Iraqi Kurdistan, this particular piece of propaganda did not receive widespread coverage in the international media. A cursory glance at ISIS propaganda suggests that the West is its primary target. While this may be the case in terms of the group's long-term ambitions, events on the ground in Syria and Iraq paint a very different picture, with ISIS predominantly killing those it deems to be ""apostate"", including its co-religionists. In light of events in Syria and Iraq, the international community must react robustly and swiftly. This week's NATO summit is fortuitously timed, and one would hope that the ISIS crisis takes its place at the top of the meeting's agenda. However, as I've said before, a strategy of solely Western intervention would play right into the ISIS ideology. Indeed, it would be exactly what the group wants. As such, it is paramount that other states -- particularly those within the region -- step up to the plate as well. Countries such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia must actively respond instead of leaving it to others. It is not just the international community that has a responsibility, though: the media must act as well. It is paramount that it carefully considers its treatment of ISIS propaganda, with its twin aims of intimidation and recruitment. Every time a still or clip from an ISIS video is shown, the group gets what it wants: the oxygen of publicity. Of course, it is necessary that people the world over are aware of the atrocities occurring at the hands of ISIS, but journalists must be careful not to do the jihadists' job for them. This also involves establishing a firm no-platform policy for al-Baghadi's stooges in the West. These insidious individuals thrive on media attention, which they use to amplify their otherwise ostracized voices. As Quilliam's last report, which looked at extremist content online, showed, it is an unfortunate truth that online censorship does not work. Any attempts at censorship in the aftermath of the Foley killing were always doomed to failure. Simply put, corporations and governments are unable to remove propaganda from the internet at the rate that it is uploaded. More effective than government-led censorship was the ""ISIS media blackout,"" in which users across the internet resolutely refused to publicize ISIS material. After all, videos like these have minimal propaganda value if they have no audience. At the same time, instead of publicizing what ISIS wants, we must popularize what it doesn't. The anti-ISIS fatwa recently released by prominent Sunni British imams would be a good place to start, because it dismantles any sense of legitimacy for the self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" and directly calls for Muslim communities to take an active stance in opposing this appalling group. More initiatives like this must emerge. That they have not materialized already is testament an untenable situation in which the vast majority of Muslims, who are invariably moderate, are largely silent, something which leaves extremists to dominate the discourse on Islam. The time has passed when we can allow ISIS to popularize itself unchallenged. Challenging ISIS propaganda must be at the forefront of international policy towards Syria and Iraq. And it is not just something for governments to deal with. People all over the world, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, are responsible too.","West outraged at beheading of second U.S. hostage by ISIS militants .

"(CNN) -- China's ruling Communist party unleashed a blistering attack Wednesday on dissident artist Ai Weiwei -- and on the West for criticizing his apparent arrest. Ai has not been seen since Sunday, when he and an assistant said on Twitter that they had been taken into custody en route to Hong Kong. China broke its silence Wednesday with a pair of articles in a Communist party newspaper. One Global Times piece said he had been ""detained by police, according to overseas media reports."" The other article, an editorial, said Ai ""has been close to the red line of Chinese law... as long as Ai Weiwei continuously marches forward, he will inevitably touch the red line one day."" ""He will pay a price for his special choice, which is the same in any society,"" said the editorial, which called him ""an activist,"" and ""a maverick."" Ai, one of the country's best-known artists, helped design the iconic Bird's Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympics, but later called for a boycott of the 2008 games because he said China was using them as propaganda. The artist has also accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents. The Global Times editorial Wednesday blasted ""Western governments and human rights institutions"" for calling for his release. It accused them of ""reckless collision against China's basic political framework and ignorance of China's judicial sovereignty to exaggerate a specific case,"" and failing to find out ""the truth."" ""The West's behavior aims at disrupting the attention of Chinese society and attempts to modify the value system of the Chinese people,"" the Global Times said. The Chinese-language version of the article is harsher, saying criticism from the West is the reason Chinese people ""loathe"" it. Ai Weiwei's name has apparently been censored on Chinese online forums, but people are getting around the ban by using nicknames and puns, or by using his father's and wife's names in posts. Some also refer to him as a baker of sunflower seeds, a reference to his installation at London's Tate Modern art museum of 100 million painted pottery sunflower seeds. Police surrounded his studio Sunday after authorities reportedly detained him at a Beijing airport. ""They crack down on everybody who has different opinions -- not even different opinions, just different attitudes,"" he told CNN last year. ""Simply to have different opinions can cost (dissidents) their life; they can be put in jail, can be silenced and can disappear."" In the past, Ai has noted that he has paid a price for his own dissent. In January, the artist said authorities placed him under house arrest to stop him from attending an event he planned after officials announced that his new studio would be demolished. ""Just recently I heard the new studio I built in Shanghai will be demolished, all because of my activities,"" Ai said at the time. ""So what is my activity? My activity is very simple, asking basic rights for people to freely express themselves and also to find a new structure, a new way of communicating. Because I'm an artist and this is what I do and I believe in that."" In the past several weeks, Chinese authorities have detained and arrested a number of lawyers and human rights activists amid calls for anti-government protests similar to those that have swept the Middle East. CNN's Eve Bower, Eileen Hsieh and Kristie Lu Stout contributed to this report.","Articles in the Communist party newspaper seem to confirm his arrest .

"Four people have been arrested in connection with last week's coal mine fire in Soma, Turkey, that killed 301 miners, the country's semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. Soma Coal Mining Company operating manager Akin Celik, engineers Yalcin Erdogan and Ertan Ersoy, and security chief Yasin Kurnaz were taken into custody Sunday, the agency said, citing Turkish prosecutor Bekir Sahiner. Twenty-five people were detained and questioned, Anadolu reported. The search for victims of Tuesday's fire ended Saturday. Authorities believe they have now recovered the bodies of all the workers who perished. The investigation into what caused the deadliest disaster in Turkish mining history continues, the Natural Disaster and Emergency Coordination Directorate said. The last bodies were pulled out Saturday afternoon, Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said. However, as the recovery effort comes to an end, controversy over Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's response to the tragedy refuses to blow over. On Friday, police in Soma used tear gas, plastic pellets and a water cannon on protesters angered by the government's response. The protesters, dressed mostly in black, chanted ""Don't sleep, Soma, remember your dead!"" as they passed through city streets a few miles from the disaster site trying to reach a statue honoring miners. Amid a rising tide of discontent, local authorities have banned protests in Soma and apparently clamped down on those taking part. Lawyers' representatives told Turkish broadcaster DHA that eight lawyers and 25 other citizens were detained Saturday. The lawyers were in town to try to help represent families of the dead miners. Abdurrahman Savas, the governor of Manisa province, where Soma is located, declined to say how many people had been detained over the protests. But he told reporters that the authorities decided Friday to ban rallies and demonstrations in Soma to maintain peace and security. ""This is not to prevent freedom of expression,"" he said. Distrust of the government is running high in certain sectors of society, with some voicing doubts about the official count of those missing, while others question the fact no one has yet taken responsibility for the tragedy. Some are also critical of the authorities' use of tear gas and the water cannon against demonstrators. Erdogan's missteps . Public anger has been fueled in part by Erdogan's own missteps while visiting the scene of the disaster Wednesday. First, Erdogan's comments to relatives of dead and injured miners, in which he described the disaster as par for the course in a dangerous business, were seen as highly insensitive and drew scathing criticism. Then video taken on the same day in Soma showed Erdogan telling a man ""don't be nasty,"" according to the footage aired Friday by DHA. The remarks initially reported and translated by DHA were confirmed by a CNN native Turkish speaker. ""What happened happened. It is from God. ... If you boo the country's prime minister, you get slapped,"" Erdogan is heard saying. That was after another video clip emerged showing a crowd outside a grocery store angrily booing Erdogan. As the Prime Minister entered the crowded store, he appeared to put his arm around the neck of a man who was later identified as a miner. After the confrontation, the video captured what appeared to be Erdogan's security guards beating the same man to the floor. The miner said later that Erdogan slapped him, possibly by mistake. He wants an apology for the way he was treated by the Prime Minister's staff. In addition, a photograph of an aide to Erdogan kicking a protester surfaced Wednesday, an image that quickly became a symbol of the anger felt by many against the government, and amid mounting questions over safety practices at the mine. Huseyin Celik, a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party, dismissed the grocery store incident and said the image of the aide, Yusuf Yerkel, kicking the protester was misleading. Yerkel was quoted by the Anadolu news agency Thursday as saying that he had been deeply saddened by the previous day's events. ""I am sad that I could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation, insults and attacks that I was subjected to that day,"" he reportedly said. Questions over safety chambers . The mine complex exploded in flames for unknown reasons Tuesday, trapping many miners deep underground. Among other issues, mine officials indicated Friday that workers may not have had access to an emergency refuge where they could have taken shelter from the flames and choking fumes. The owner of the company, Alp Gurman, said the mine met the highest standards laid out by the law in Turkey. The company, he said, had no legal obligation to build safety chambers. Asked about that issue, Minister of Labor and Social Security Faruk Celik defended Turkey's workplace safety act and said it was set up within the framework of EU regulations, according to CNN Turk. ""This is a dynamic area,"" he said, adding that it is the duty of each company to ensure workers' safety needs are met. ""Could people be sent to death because a certain sentence is not in the regulations?"" he asked. Istanbul Technical University said it had dropped Gurman and a fellow Soma Holding manager, Ismet Kasapoglu, from an advisory panel in its mining faculty, following protests and an occupation by students at the university, CNN Turk reported. Political bonfire . Hundreds also took to the streets last week in anti-government protests in Istanbul and Ankara, with police answering, in some cases, with water cannons and tear gas. As Erdogan took a stroll through Soma, onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of ""Resign, Prime Minister!"" Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu defended Erdogan in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. ""He was feeling all these pains in his heart,"" he said. ""Everybody knows that our Prime Minister is always with the people, and always feels the pain of the people. Otherwise, he wouldn't get such a high support in eight elections in (the) last 10 years."" But the disaster opened up an old political wound. Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel, who is from the Manisa region, which includes Soma, filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents. Erdogan's government rejected the proposal. It claimed that the mine, owned by Soma Komur Isletmeleri A.S., had passed recent inspections. A Turkish engineers' association criticized mine ventilation and safety equipment last week as being ""insufficient and old."" A lack of safety inspections has caused 100 coal mines to be closed in the last three years, according to Turkey's Energy Ministry. President Abdullah Gul, speaking as he visited Soma on Thursday, said he was sure the investigation already begun would ""shed light"" on what regulations are needed. ""Whatever is necessary will be done,"" he said. Despair, anger, dwindling hope after Turkey coal mine fire .","Four people, including engineers and a manager, are arrested, says prosecutor .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rhode Island's top Roman Catholic leader has asked Rep. Patrick Kennedy to stop taking Communion over his support for abortion rights, the diocese said Sunday. In a statement issued Sunday, Providence Bishop Thomas Tobin said he told Kennedy in February 2007 that it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to continue receiving the fundamental Catholic sacrament, ""and I now ask respectfully that you refrain from doing so."" Kennedy, a Democrat, is the son of the late Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and a scion of the most prominent Catholic family in modern U.S. politics. In an interview published Sunday, Patrick Kennedy told the Providence Journal that Tobin had barred him from receiving communion and instructed priests in the diocese not to administer the sacrament ""because of the positions that I've taken as a public official."" Tobin, in a statement issued in response to the Kennedy interview, said his advice to the congressman was ""pastoral and confidential,"" and he was surprised that Kennedy chose to discuss it publicly. ""I am disappointed that the congressman would make public my request of nearly three years ago that sought to provide solely for his spiritual well-being,"" he said. The Roman Catholic Church strongly opposes abortion, which has been legal across the United States since 1973. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops lobbied for tight restrictions on federal funding of abortion in the health care bill the House of Representatives passed earlier this month. Kennedy opposed a provision that restricted the use of federal money for abortions, but voted in favor of final passage of the bill that included that language. Efforts to reach Kennedy's representatives were unsuccessful Sunday afternoon. But most bishops and priests oppose using communion as a ""political weapon,"" and Kennedy's disclosure may be an attempt to push back against the bishops' support for the abortion restrictions in the House bill, CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen said. ""The Catholic bishops have been fairly successful, at least to date, at putting abortion at the center of the debate over health care reform, and that obviously has generated some resentment from people who don't share their views,"" Allen said. Kennedy's decision to come forward ""in effect puts the Catholic bishops in a negative light, because it ends up making them look intolerant,"" Allen said. Tobin said Sunday only that he asked Kennedy not to take Communion. ""I have no desire to continue the discussion of Congressman Kennedy's spiritual life in public,"" he said. ""At the same time, I will absolutely respond publicly and strongly whenever he attacks the Catholic Church, misrepresents the teachings of the church or issues inaccurate statements about my pastoral ministry."" In an October interview, Kennedy criticized the bishops for threatening to oppose the overall bill if it did not include those restrictions. That prompted Tobin to call Kennedy's position ""unacceptable to the church and scandalous to many of our members."" The latest exchange was comes on the 46th anniversary of the assassination of Kennedy's uncle, John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. Patrick Kennedy is the last member of his family serving in Congress.","Patrick Kennedy tells newspaper that bishop barred him from Communion .

"Ever since Starbucks had the business acumen to make free WiFi as defining to its brand as ""grande frappucinos,"" workers have delighted in leaving their offices in favor of brighter, more caffeinated workspaces. As the traditional office undergoes a global demise, hotels are starting to change their function to accommodate the new wave of mobile workers. ""We're really trying to transform the way people think about hotels,"" says Peggy Roe, Marriott International's vice president of global operations services. ""We want people to think of Marriott as a place not just to come and sleep, but to work."" Earlier this year, Marriott started testing a new concept called Workspace on Demand. In 35 hotels throughout the U.S. (and one in Europe), guests and non-guests alike can book small-scale meeting space for $50 an hour. ""Customers said that they were basically sneaking into the lobby to steal WiFi, or else were sitting in our parking lot and plugging in from their car. We say, 'we give you permission. Come in and sit in our lobby.'"" The last three months were an operational experiment, says Roe, one that was obviously successful. In the next two months, they will expand Workspace on Demand to six more locations in the U.S., with an eye on their properties abroad. Read more: Tablets transform in-flight entertainment . Marriott essentially offers little more than a table and a plug, but, says Roe, ""mostly people just want a basic space to work. They haven't asked for more than that."" Last month, Westin Hotels & Resorts launched Tangent, which is similarly aimed at a younger, more transient workforce. Their rooms, which are priced at $50 to $60 an hour, accommodate a smaller audience (four max), and are a bit more tricked out. The focal point is media:scape, a worktable that lets multiple users drag and share documents from their person devices. There is a whiteboard area for brainstorming and even an Xbox. There is also a lounge area to help facilitate job interviews, a function that guests were previously performing in the hotel lobby. ""You'd see a group of consultants hovering over a laptop, trying to prepare for a presentation, or else people had interviews, and the lobby wasn't providing enough privacy for the topic they were discussing,"" says Brian Povinelli, senior vice president and global brand leader at Westin and Meridien. Read more: What women want: Hotels look to cater for more female business travelers . Westin saw an opportunity to accommodate not only their guests, but the wider community of rudderless workers, and launched Tangent in Boston and Arlington, Virginia, as well as in Munich, Germany. They plan to open 40 more in the U.S. by 2014, and one in Bali is under construction. According to Westin's research, 75% of workers in the U.S. are on the move, meaning that for at least one day a week, they have no steady office. Worldwide, that number is 30%, though growing quickly. The International Data Corporation (IDC) puts the number of mobile workers worldwide at 1.3 billion. ""From a corporate perspective, signing a five- to ten-year lease for an office building is a completely broken model,"" notes Mark Gilbreath, the founder and CEO of LiquidSpace, a kind of matchmaking platform that links displaced workers with rent-by-the-hour offices. The surge of transient workers, he contends, is not merely a function of increased technology (though that has made it possible), it is also something being driven by companies. ""Real estate is the second largest expense  for most companies, and if you look inside the corporate campus, that desk you're assumed to be at all day, you're only at a third of the time."" In response, a growing number of companies have done away with assigned work spaces all together. Global consulting firm Accenture made business headlines last year when they abandoned permanent offices. LiquidSpace is partnered with Marriott, Westin and a number of real estate companies that want to earn a profit on underutilized office space. They are also partnered with big firms, such as Accenture, who use the LiquidSpace platform to allow employees to search for available desks internally. Read more: Business or pleasure?

"Two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot who were freed from prison Monday will continue to be a headache for President Vladimir Putin's government, they told CNN. Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, who served all but two months of their two-year prison sentences, said they will continue to live in Russia and continue to perform in the band. They were not deterred by their tough time in prison, where meals were rancid and punishment included hypothermia and bathroom lockouts. ""We were not defeated because we had our own victories over the system. You can't make us silent,"" Tolokonnikova said Tuesday. ""If you want to have us in (a prison in) Mordovia, you'll have us there.  But it will be the same headache for you, we guarantee you."" The release of the two punk rockers was approved last week when Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law announced by Putin. The Russian government said the amnesty marked the anniversary of the adoption of Russia's post-Communist constitution in 1993. But Tolokonnikova, released from a Siberian facility on Monday, told CNN she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government's image before it hosts the Winter Olympics in February. Prison conditions . The two plan on working to change the conditions -- which they compared to slavery -- in Russia's women's prisons. ""Many people die there physically and many people die inside,"" Alyokhina said. Prisoners were made to unload their own food deliveries, which were covered in mildew.  They had to search for scraps that were still edible, Tolokonnikova said. Instead of meat, they received lard with fur on it, which she refused to eat. Women lost weight from skipping meals, so they could keep up with their massive workloads, which had them slaving away for a salary of 1 and 40 Euros a month. Going to the bathroom was difficult, and the toilets were filthy. Punishment was collective. If one girl slipped up, they all had to pay, Tolokonnikova said. They'd be forbidden from using the bathroom or not allowed to take breaks for a whole day. If they had a free day, they weren't allowed to lie down on their beds. They'd only be allowed to sit on the wooden chairs by their beds. Irked prison guards sent prisoners to the ""cold cage,"" where they were not allowed to wear adequate clothing and shivered in isolation with no heat or insulation,  Alyokhina said. She wants to fight for the women she left behind there. ""It's very important for imprisoned women to feel support. They start to get united when they feel safe and when they know they'll be heard. The idea of a potential victory is very important for them."" Dissing Putin . Pussy Riot's 2012 performance of a ""punk prayer"" that criticized Putin, who was prime minister at the time, was held at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. The musicians were found guilty of hooliganism. The rockers said they hoped for a move toward democracy, toward a country with less hate. ""There is too much hatred in this country. Or hatred against the West,"" Tolokonnikova said.  ""We'd like to help it become more humane but I'm afraid it's impossible with Putin in power."" Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova said they don't regret going to prison and missing time with their children. Alyokhina told CNN it was the right moral choice and a good education for the kids. ""I don't believe we lost this time.  It's a priceless experience,"" Tolokonnikova said. ""We hope that it will motivate our kids to find something they would believe in so strongly as we believe in what we did."" Soviet times . She said the current government is weak, and eventually other Russians will see the problems and the corruption. ""Changes have begun, but you need to constantly work on them.  The Russian system is designed in such a way that without social control, it will die immediately.  Because the people in the system will try to use every possibility to escape from their obligation and responsibilities."" Not much, if anything, has changed since the days of Soviet rule, they said. ""If the Ministry of Justice released a new order, it would be exact copy of the one from the Soviet times.  We're going to change this,"" Alyokhina  said. But two people cannot change a nation, so the punk rockers said they are going to get lawyers to investigate the prison violations. They said they saw some progress while they were in prison, but now that they are free, they think they can get better results.","Food in prison was rancid and punishment was collective and hazing .

"(CNN) -- Scientists studying the carcass of what they call the heaviest squid ever found have discovered it has eyes as big as soccer balls -- reportedly the largest in the world. Scientists are interviewed while two colossal squids are defrosted. The one on the right is missing part of its body. The colossal squid's eyes were measured at about 27 centimeters (10.8 inches) across by researchers, who have been defrosting it and a smaller specimen at Te Papa, the national museum of New Zealand. ""This is the only intact eye (of a colossal squid) that's ever been found. It's spectacular,"" squid specialist Kat Bolstad of the Auckland University of Technology told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Bolstad, one of a team of international scientists brought in to examine the creature, added: ""It's the largest known eye in the animal kingdom."" His assertion was backed up by Swedish professor Eric Warrant of the University of Lund, who specializes in vision in invertebrates. ""This is the largest eye ever recorded in history and studied,"" Warrant told AP. ""It has a huge lens the size of an orange and captures an awful lot of light in the dark depths in which it hunts."" Scientists snaked a camera into the colossal squid's body and measured its beak and tentacles in an exam broadcast live on the Internet. ""It didn't seem really fair that only a handful of people would get to see an animal like this up close,"" said Steve O'Shea, a marine biologist at the Auckland University of Technology. He led a team that examined the corps of the colossal squid on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in a lab at Wellington's Te Papa. ""It's the end of three days without much sleep,"" O'Shea told CNN. ""It's been an exhausting exercise."" Blog dispatches from the lab provided updates (""They're going to rotate the Squid!"") peppered with commentary (""anything with lots of legs/tentacles gives me the willies but if it's here -- and not moving is a plus in my book -- you have to touch!"") A New Zealand fishing boat snagged the squid in February 2007, as it sought toothfish in the Antarctic waters of the Ross Sea. The crew hauled in a line with many baited hooks and discovered a massive squid feasting on one of the hooked fish, the museum says on its Web site. Researchers determined it was a colossal squid, a species first documented in 2003 that tends to weigh more than the also-big giant squid. The larger colossal squid that scientists examined this week weighed 1,091 pounds (495 kilograms) and measured about 32 feet (10 meters), the museum said. ""We probably have more questions than we have answers now,"" O'Shea said just after completing the exam. Yet the team made at least one key finding. When they measured the colossal squid's beak, O'Shea said, they were stunned to discover that it was shorter than colossal-squid beaks recovered from the stomachs of sperm whales, which prey on squid. That led O'Shea to conclude that even heavier colossal squid lurk somewhere below the surface, unseen by human eyes. ""They grow considerably larger,"" he said.

"The U.S .Presidential race is going down to the wire and with Barack Obama and Mitt Romney looking to sway those undecided voters, the U.S. president has secured the backing of an unlikely supporter -- Cristiano Ronaldo. The Real Madrid star is widely seen as one of the two greatest footballers on the planet at present, along with Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, and knows what it takes to win, with a trophy cabinet boasting medals for the Champions League, the English Premier League as well as the Spanish League and Cup. Never afraid to seek the limelight, the Portuguese joins former Manchester United colleague Wayne Rooney in outlining how he would exercise his vote in the U.S. elections should he have one -- with both men identifying with the White House's current resident. ""I like the way he speaks with people, his communication -- I think it's always firm what he says -- and I would like to meet him because he's an honest person,"" Ronaldo exclusively told CNN. Last month, England star Rooney revealed a hitherto-unseen political interest after the third and final televised debate between the Democrat and Republic candidates. ""Watched all the presidential debates. If I had to vote, would vote Obama,"" tweeted Rooney, who has over five million Twitter followers. Neither Rooney nor Ronaldo can vote in the elections given their nationalities but Obama can count on some similarly  heavyweight sporting figures back home -- with baseball legends Willie Mays and Hank Aaron having both pledged their support to the Democrat. New Orleans Saints wide receiver Marques Colston has been one of the largest donors to the Obama campaign, pledging $73,000, while Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and the legendary Michael Jordan were among a bevy of NBA stars who participated in August's 'Obama Classic', a fund-raising basketball event which drew a host of stars. Celebrity endorsement . Despite the credentials of those standing behind their man, a leading Professor of  American Studies warned that the impact of such celebrity endorsement is far weaker now than it has been in years gone by. ""The candidates are hoping to grab a bit of airtime, free advertising in effect, through these stars but there are so many different channels of information that this gets diluted now,"" says Alabama-born Scott Lucas from the University of Birmingham in England. ""There has just been so much more to focus on at this election, in that it has been such a close race. The stars can create a bit of a ripple, and it's a nice talking point, but it's not the same as it was 20 years ago when the Hollywood left used to make an impact. ""Today, the biggest celebrity is (former U.S. President) Bill Clinton and when he came out this weekend he got the type of treatment that is usually reserved for sports and entertainment celebrities -- the issue for the Republicans is that they have no one to match Clinton's impact."" Romney supporters . That may be, but Republican candidate Romney does have the backing of one of the biggest sporting icons in United States history -- former golfer Jack Nicklaus, whose tally of 18 Majors is still unsurpassed. Now 72, Nicklaus -- who rallied Cincinatti Bengals fans to vote for the Republicans ahead of their game this weekend -- could help Romney in the key voting state of Ohio, where the 'Golden Bear' lives. Other leading sports figures backing Romney are fellow golfer Rickie Fowler, tennis' four-time Major winner Jim Courier, legendary NFL quarterback John Elway and Mike Eruzione, who captained the U.S. to 1980 Olympic glory following the famous Miracle of Ice win over the Soviet Union. ""It has been over 10 years, so many of you may have forgotten, but in 2002, due to bribery scandals and mismanagement, the Olympics - not just those Games - but the Olympics as an institution - were threatened. Thankfully, Mitt Romney was there, to salvage a desperate situation,"" Eruzione said of a man who helped restore some order to Salt Lake City's controversial hosting of the Winter Olympics. ""Just like the Olympics needed Mitt's leadership 10 years ago, America desperately needs Mitt Romney's leadership today. Please join me in making him the next President of the United States!"" On Monday, both Obama and Romney spent the final hours of the campaign making a mad dash through battleground states in a late push to sway a closely divided electorate ahead of Tuesday's election. In a final 24 hours, Obama and Romney -- or their campaign surrogates, including their wives and the vice presidential candidates -- are scheduled to make stops in Ohio, Iowa, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. The push comes as national polls show the race is tied. A new CNN poll showed 49% support for Obama and 49% for Romney.","Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo says he would vote for Barack Obama if he could .

"They call themselves ""the resistance."" Israel and the United States call them terrorists. What's unclear is who's calling the shots within the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The political and the military arms of the group appear to have contrasting mission statements, and analysts say it's hard to pin down precisely who has the final word on making decisions and guiding strategy. Here's an introduction to Hamas' key players: . THE POLITICAL WING . KHALED MESHAAL . He's Hamas' top political leader and often its public face. He's had the role since 2004 after Hamas' then-leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. A former teacher, Meshaal operates mostly from Qatar and is known as Hamas' external deal-maker, raising money from supporters in the region. ""Despite his George Clooney-type looks, he's very much a dangerous man because he aids and abets Hamas' very destructive policies and strategy,"" said Neri Zilber of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. While it's not clear how much control Meshaal has over the military wing of the group, one Israeli official calls the 58-year-old ""the Osama bin Laden of Hamas."" A bizarre assassination plot: In 1997, Meshaal was the target of a bizarre assassination attempt by the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service. Mossad agents confronted Meshaal in Jordan and injected or sprayed poison into his ear. It might have ended right there. But Jordan's King Hussein, who had a peace treaty with Israel, threatened to break off relations unless Mossad delivered the antidote to the poison. And they did. ""Allah saved me. Then King Hussein,"" Meshaal told CNN in 2002. A $70 million budget: In 2012, Meshaal left his previous base of operations in Syria as the country's civil war deepened. That decision is believed to have led to a breakdown in his relationship with Iran, Hamas' key backer, said Firas Abi Ali, head of Middle East and North Africa Country Risk and Forecasting at IHS. ""The Qataris, who are backing him now, are not able to provide the military expertise and training on rockets and drones that the military wing needs to fight Israel,"" he said. ""These are things that only the Iranians can provide."" But there are other members who still enjoy the support of Iran. And, as Meshaal told CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Hamas enjoys the support of expatriate Palestinians, private donors in the Middle East and Muslim charities -- enough to bankroll its $70 million annual budget. ""Hamas -- as a movement of resistance, with a cause, for a people living under occupation --  we seek, not just wait, to get support, financial support, military support, political support from all over the world, from all the states in the world,"" he said. ""Everyone giving us support, whether it's from Iran or Europe, from anywhere."" ISMAIL HANIYEH AND MOUSA ABU MARZOUK . Hamas formed in 1987 at the start of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, as an Islamic resistance movement against Israel. In 2006, Hamas won a majority in Palestinian legislative elections and formed a unity government with its rival Fatah. But the coalition collapsed into deadly violence in 2007, leaving Hamas in control of Gaza and the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority in power in the West Bank. During Hamas' short-lived coalition with Fatah, Haniyeh became Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. After their 2007 split, he retained the role for Hamas in Gaza. The group's second political leader is Mousa Abu Marzouk. In Iran's good books: Haniyeh is a former leader of Hamas' student movement. He was considered to be a close associate of the group's founder and spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Yassin was assassinated by an Israeli airstrike as he was leaving a Gaza City mosque in 2004. ""The faction in Gaza led by Ismail Haniyeh and Mousa Abu Marzouk appears to still be in Iran's good books,"" said Abi Ali. ""It still has good relations with Iran, given the increased sophistication of rockets used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad."" Haniyeh and Abu Marzouk are believed to operate between Egypt and Gaza. But the Egyptian government has made movement between Egypt and Gaza a lot harder for Hamas leaders. ""The siege has led the Gaza-based factions to band together,"" Abi Ali said. ""They're more coherent and cohesive."" Goodwill among the people: Part of the pair's job is to ensure that Hamas continues to enjoy widespread backing from the general population in Gaza. The group does it through its many social welfare programs. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, ""(its) efforts in this area -- as well as a reputation for honesty, in contrast to the many Fatah officials accused of corruption -- help to explain its broad popularity."" THE MILITARY WING . MOHAMMED DEIF . Since Hamas took over Gaza, the armed wing, Qassam Brigades, has morphed into a military force aimed at protecting the territory. Its fighters have also continued to periodically fire rockets into Israel. The Israeli military estimated this month that Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza have between them roughly 10,000 rockets of varying ranges. The military wing is led by Mohammed Deif, a shadowy, savvy figure who analysts say has survived multiple Israeli assassination attempts. Always on the move: The Qassam Brigades' website says that Deif's real name is ""Mohammed Diab.""  It says he took the name ""Deif,"" which means ""guest,"" because under the pursuit of Israeli security forces, ""he kept moving from village to village and from place to place."" Deif was wounded years ago and is believed to have handed some operational parts of his role to other top Hamas military leaders like Marwan Issa. ""Over the years, it's lost a lot of military commanders during assassinations and military conflicts,"" said Abi Ali. ""It's proven that it's robust enough to take this kind of event and keep improving its capability."" MARWAN ISSA . Marwan Issa's forte is believed to be unconventional attacks on Israel. ""It could be these kidnapping or offensive-type operations through attack tunnels underneath the Gaza border inside Israel,"" Zilber said. The Qassam Brigades also said it has sent several drones on missions inside Israel. The Israel Defense Forces said it shot down a drone off the country's coast on Monday. ""What we are seeing in this conflict is the military wing asserting itself as the one in control,"" said Abi Ali. Always a target: And it's that kind of tactic that may, according to analysts, have made Issa one of Israel's chief targets in its offensive. In 2006, he survived an Israeli military assassination attempt. This month, his house was targeted in Israeli airstrikes. He's believed to be in hiding elsewhere. SALEH AL AROURI . Al Arouri is the head of the Qassam Brigades in the West Bank, and he is accused of catalyzing this latest conflict. Israeli officials say he's the person who ordered the abduction of the three Israeli teens, whose bodies were later found in a field in the West Bank. ""Al Arouri, who used to live in a village north of Ramallah, has urged West Bank operatives incessantly to set up terror cells and perpetrate kidnappings,"" The Times of Israel reported last month, quoting an Israeli security official. Sitting safe in Turkey: Last month, Israeli military demolished what is believed to be Al Arouri's home in the West Bank. But he wasn't there. His base of operation is Turkey, where he's safe from the reaches of the Israeli forces. Turkey cut all diplomatic relations with Israel after commandos boarded a boat carrying supplies to Gaza and killed nine people in 2010. Act of desperation: So, who exactly is in charge? ""None of these movements are monoliths,""  said Abi Ali. Still, he said, ""what we are seeing in this conflict is the military wing asserting itself as the one in control."" Khaled Elgindy, who was a former adviser to the Palestinian Authority, said Hamas is in one of the weakest positions it's been in in several years. ""The changes that have happened in the region and especially in Egypt; their closure of the tunnels and its access to finances and weapons have been severely diminished over the last year in particular. So they're in a much weaker position,"" he said. And that weakened position, he says, is fueling the military wing's belligerence. ""I think part of the motivation for sort of, you know, taking the Israeli bait, if you will, in this latest round of violence has been, I think, the fact that they're in a state of disarray and, you know, in a way I think it's an act of desperation by a very weak Hamas.""","Amid the Gaza conflict, experts try to figure out who's in charge .

"(CNN)Some lawmakers in Oklahoma want to make Advanced Placement  U.S. History history. What's their beef? The course, which was redesigned by the College Board and implemented in high school classrooms last year, isn't quite pro-America enough. ""In essence, we have a new emphasis on what is bad about America,"" said state representative Dan Fisher, the measure's chief sponsor. ""(The new framework) trades an emphasis on America's founding principles of Constitutional government  in favor of robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people, where the emphasis on instruction is of America as a nation of oppressors and exploiters,"" Fisher lamented at a legislative committee hearing  Tuesday. Not only does HB 1380 -- which sailed through a committee hearing this week -- bar state funds from being used on AP History, the legislation specifies what should be taught in the classroom by specifically identifying dozens of ""documents, writings, speeches, proclamations and recordings related to the history, heritage and foundation of the United States"" in the 10-page bill. What did Fisher single out?  Old standards such as The Gettysburg Address, Madison's Federalist No. 10 and ""Common Sense"" by Thomas Paine. The bill doesn't totally avoid what Fisher called America's ""blemishes"":  He included Martin Luther King's ""Letter from Birmingham Jail"" essay and ""I Have a Dream"" speech, as well as the ""Ballot or the Bullet"" speech made by Malcolm X as part of the replacement curriculum. Fisher, a Republican, also singled out three speeches made by Ronald Reagan and one by George W. Bush as important enough to U.S. history to be added to the new curriculum , but none from from Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, or Jimmy Carter -- the last three Democratic presidents.","Bill would ban AP History in Oklahoma, replace it with new curriculum .

"Investigators believe a killer is among them, strolling the lush streets of this coastal California community, on the hunt for another victim. A police sketch circulates around town, along with a detailed description: A white male, 56 to 60, last seen wearing a white shirt and aviator glasses. His motive: aggravation. Authorities say the suspect may be so tired of roaming peacocks in this high-end community on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County that he's systematically killing them. But this time he may have slipped up. In July, a witness spotted the man pull up in a Mercedes Benz and open fire on a peacock with a pellet gun. That brings the death toll to 50 in two years, and Lt. Cesar Perea of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles wants to know whether his latest suspect is behind them all or just a copycat. If someone in the neighborhood knows, they haven't talked. In fact, it's not hard to find those who say the peacocks are anything but innocent victims, as they peck the paint off cars, squawk into the night and leave a mess wherever they go. And for that reason, suspects could be on any block. But the sketch released in the latest killing has broken the case open, says Perea. He's narrowed his list of suspects and has forensic evidence that would rival any homicide investigation. ""We needed that type of technology to be able to identify exactly what the projectiles were,"" he said. But it didn't come easy. Perea first took the dead bird to his usual lab for a necropsy, but it lacked the science needed to identify and preserve the pellet. That's when he took the bird to the coroner-- the same one doing autopsies on murder victims, only this time their victim was a peacock. ""The coroner was able to X-ray the bird, identify entry wounds and they were able to recover the projectiles, which we were able to impound for forensic evidence,"" Perea said. Meaning, the pellets are so well-preserved that they'll be used in court once the peacock killer is caught. ""Now, looking back on it, it is pretty extraordinary to think we actually used human science in an animal case,"" he said. Upping his game was a must, Perea says, as bird after bird turned up dead. Not all can be traced to human hands, but when they are, ""it's cruel."" ""A lot of these birds are being shot and left to die for days and days, "" Perea said. ""We have found birds that have had projectiles in their bodies for weeks."" Peacocks take over . ""Jackie,"" she calls out. ""Come here Jackie!"" Eunice Berman calls all her peacocks Jackie. Well, they're not hers, but they've taken a liking to her property and her kindness. In a tightly wound neighborhood where threats range from curious children-at-play to roaring trash trucks, Berman's property is a peacock sanctuary. ""Who wouldn't love them,"" she says, now almost nose-to-nose with Jackie. ""Just look at them, they're so beautiful."" Berman has lived here since 1983, but even at that length, the peacocks predate her by more than half a century. Local historians say the peacocks and other types of birds were brought here in 1913 by New York banker Frank Vanderlip while he developed the region. He gave most of his birds away during the Depression but kept the peacocks until his death in 1937. ""But the 24 peacocks that lived loose around Frank Vanderlip's property had chicks, their chicks had chicks, and their families thrived,"" wrote his granddaughter Narcissa Vanderlip for the introduction to ""Palo's World,"" one of several children's books inspired by the peafowl. Now, a century later, the peacocks are so rooted in the community they're a fixture on signs and mailboxes and have inspired a golf tournament at the local country club. ""I had a pine tree in the backyard and every night, 40 peacocks would gather in it. I used to have 'peeking at peacocks potlucks,' "" said Bob, a neighbor on Buckskin Lane too embarrassed to share a last name. ""This went on for 20 years, then I married a woman who didn't like the sound of them, so she made me cut down the tree."" Peacock pranks . Wearing a badge and carrying a gun, California law gives Perea of the SPCA full police power while investigating cruelty cases. It's serious business to him, so when he released a composite sketch of the peacock killer, he thought the community would immediately turn him in. That wasn't the case. ""People would call in saying they thought it was Jon Voight or Mike Ditka,"" Perea says of the prank calls he received. ""I did get a call where the message was peacocks squawking, so we had a joke in the office that the peacocks were trying to contact us and tell us who the suspect was."" Finding the humor is temporary relief from a frustrating case that has dragged on for two years. Perea says he's sure of two things: The suspect lives in the community and if he isn't found, another bird will turn up dead. ""It's no way for any living thing to die, to just deteriorate because of somebody's violence."" Perea said. Such is life on the streets for the peacocks of Palos Verdes -- not exactly the world depicted in the children's book ""Palo's World."" Then again, on page 9, a mother peahen sadly warns her chicks:  ""The neighborhood is full of danger for peacocks.""","In the lush hills of a California enclave, peacocks have proliferated for decades .

"These days, both violent video games and Congress have come under fire in the media and the court of public opinion, albeit for different reasons. Now, McGraw Hill Education hopes to change the perception of both gaming and the nation's lawmakers with ""Government in Action,"" a 3-D multiplayer game. Designed for the college freshman American government course, which is taken by more than 750,000 students every year, the game allows players to experience the intricacies of life as a U.S. representative -- and explain why actually getting legislation passed isn't always as easy as it would seem. For today's digital generation, it may prove a fresher approach to complex subject matter than the traditional textbook. Rep. John Tierney, D-Massaschusetts, who worked with game developer Muzzy Lane Software, hopes this game will be another tool to get students interested in learning more about how Congress works. ""The ability to interact rather than just reading a text in this technology-driven age will probably drive more interest,"" Tierney said. ""Video games with a core educational component may supplement traditional materials, such as textbooks, and may enable students to improve their understanding of certain subjects."" The game begins with the player getting elected to the House of Representatives, with two years to get re-elected. According to Stephen Laster, chief digital officer at McGraw-Hill Education, the goal is to build up political capital, awareness, approval and influence in multiple ways. Gameplay takes place both in Washington and in the player's home district. The game will randomly assign players a congressman and political affiliation, and the president of the United States will also be randomly determined with each play. The game allows players to meet with the president and go to the Supreme Court. ""Players will need to work with both national and local media, appease local and national lobbyists, hold fundraisers and find co-sponsors of bills that will keep their constituents happy and align with their own political ideologies of left, centrist or right,"" Laster said. ""In multiplayer, which supports up to 18 players, fellow classmates can join together to co-sponsor bills, and the game's been designed to be customizable based on how the instructor wants to utilize it during his class or throughout a semester."" The game, which is part of the McGraw-Hill Practice suite of hands-on, experiential learning games, was tested in schools across the country, including Georgia Perimeter College, Collin Community College in Texas, California State University, San Diego State, Richland College in Texas and Clayton State in Georgia. Professor Jason Seitz of Georgia Perimeter College said the game helped his students tie all of the concepts in his course together to develop a deeper understanding and knowledge of the subject. ""With an engaged classroom, I can spend less time transferring facts and more time exploring implications,"" he said. Despite the negative press that video games sometimes get, they're changing the way subjects are being taught in classrooms across the country. According to a March 2012 survey of teachers, 32% use games two to four days per week, while 18% use them every day. An overwhelming 70% of teachers agreed that using digital games boosts motivation and engagement, and 62% of teachers said that games make teaching easier. Dave McCool, president and CEO of Muzzy Lane Software, said the challenge with serious games is to make them both fun and educational. While there have been proven benefits of using games as part of educational curriculum, educational games aren't flooding the market. ""The fact that 'Oregon Trail' and 'Carmen Sandiego' still stand out after 30 years isn't great from the perspective of how powerful good, serious games can be,"" McCool said. McCool's team is expanding ""Government in Action"" to work on iPad and Android tablets to take advantage of touch controls. The iPad version of the game will make its debut at the 2013 SXSWedu conference in Austin, Texas.

"From the moment we cross the Turkish border into Syria, evidence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria's draconian and brutal rule lingers. More than a month after the group was driven from the town of Addana, residents here drive through the streets, pointing out where ISIS fighters carried out executions and left bodies to rot for all to see. ""That's where they had one of their checkpoints,"" says rebel fighter Abu Sa'ed, pointing to a small concrete building on the side of the road as we speed past. ISIS arrived in Addana about a year ago, initially welcomed in the conservative town by Islamist fighters. But within a few months, ISIS had entrenched itself and begun exerting its harsh order through what one fighter calls ""terrorism and punishment."" ""ISIS came in and took over one area and announced it was an Islamic state and did whatever they wanted,"" Abu Sa'ed says. In the passenger's seat, fellow fighter Abu Jaafar sighs, his AK-47 trained out the window. ""They used to leave the bodies of people they executed at the checkpoint for days,"" he says. ""The corpses would rot. No one could avoid looking at them."" Amid the civil war in Syria, another war is taking place -- one that pits moderate and Islamist rebels against radicals from ISIS, a group so radical that even al Qaeda has reportedly distanced itself from it. Both groups of fighters are opposed to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. For months, reports have been emerging from northern Syria about ISIS atrocities. In Addana, bullet holes riddle the walls at a former ISIS prison. Most of them are at the same level -- the average height of a man. ""Those are mostly from the executions,"" says Abu Jamal, another fighter.  ""Others are from the battle."" At the town's courthouse, a fresh coat of white paint covers the black mark left by ISIS -- known to paint buildings black as they take over Syrian towns. Executions would take place out front. In the back, freshly dug dirt marks where some of the bodies were buried in mass graves. Abu Jamal points to a pile of burning trash. ISIS beheaded one of the top rebel commanders -- placing his head in that very spot -- in broad daylight when the market was packed with people as a warning: anyone who dared oppose them would have the same fate. In early January, rebel groups banded together and launched an offensive against ISIS in Addana and other areas in northern Syria. ""We had to leave the fronts with the regime,"" Abu Jamal says, ""and fall back to fight ISIS and liberate the already liberated areas."" Still, many in Addana are too afraid to speak openly. So deep is their fear, they don't even want to be seen with us. Next to the former prison, a family waits, hoping for closure.  Volunteers shovel dirt from a grave they dug up before.  Video filmed at the time shows four contorted corpses.  It's among many mass graves rebel fighters have unearthed. ""We found a foot, a shoe, and a jacket,"" Addana resident Ayoush Ali tells us. Her neighbor Mohammed Ismail joins us.  His two younger brothers are missing, he says. ""It's my brother's jacket. He just went out to get sugar and tomatoes."" A man drops a pile of children's socks, covered in dirt, on the ground. ""His wife wanted socks for their kids,"" Mohammed says, still disbelieving. The day after we meet Mohammed, the bodies are dug up.  It's three of his brothers who were killed by ISIS.  He had thought one of them was in jail. He crouches on the ground, covering his face, shoulders shaking as he sobs.","The radical opposition group ISIS was driven from Addana more than a month ago .

"Kenya (CNN) -- As a child, Leela Hazzah would spend her summer nights lying on the rooftop of her family's home in Egypt. Her father and uncle had told her stories of their childhood, when they would sleep on the same rooftop and hear lions roaring. ""I used to lay there, listening for those same sounds. But I didn't hear anything,"" Hazzah said. Hazzah's father finally got the courage to tell his young daughter that she would not hear lions roaring because they had long since gone extinct in Egypt. ""That was the moment when I decided I knew what I wanted to do,"" Hazzah said. ""I wanted to hear lions roaring."" Hazzah, now 35, has since devoted her life to lion conservation. While earning her master's in conservation biology, Hazzah's research led her to Kenya. She lived in a tree house and began seeing firsthand the rapid decline of African lions due to habitat loss and human-lion conflict. ""Sixty years ago, there were probably half a million lions in Africa. Today, there are less than 30,000 lions in all of Africa,"" she said. Now armed with a doctorate in environmental studies, Hazzah has found one solution to help the lion population grow. Her nonprofit turns Maasai warriors -- who have a tradition of killing lions -- into lion protectors. The organization employs 65 Lion Guardians throughout East Africa. Their ultimate goal: reduce lion killings. ""The lion is iconic,"" said Hazzah, who started Lion Guardians in 2007. ""If there are no lions left in Africa, it will have a significant effect. ... We could lose a lot more than just the lion."" Changing a culture . Hazzah spent a year living among the Maasai to understand their relationship with lions and why they were killing them. For one, young warriors receive their lion name when they first kill a lion, a sort of rite of passage. ""It brings a huge amount of prestige to the warrior who kills a lion,"" Hazzah said. The Maasai also live a mostly pastoral life and depend on their livestock. They use it to feed their families; they use it for currency. Livestock is also a status symbol. ""Livestock are the core of their culture. ... It's their main source of livelihood,"" Hazzah said. ""When they lose their cows, they don't have anything left. So they retaliate, and they kill lions."" Hazzah's idea for Lion Guardians came together while living in the community and spending time with the warriors. ""They started opening up and telling me stories,"" she said. ""That's when it clicked."" Hazzah realized that Maasai warriors, the leaders and protectors in their community, would be the best ambassadors for lions. She began teaching them the benefits of protecting lions, with an emphasis on preserving their culture. In turn, the lessons began rippling through the entire tribe. ""Maasai have a very close-knit relationship with lions. It's very much a love-and-hate relationship,"" Hazzah said. ""They dislike them because they eat their livestock, but they also admire them tremendously because they are just beautiful animals."" From hunter to guardian . Today, protecting lions is a full-time job for a guardian, who earns around $100 a month. The group teaches the guardians a number of methods to reduce human-lion conflict in their communities. If a guardian hears about a lion hunt, he intervenes. He helps the individuals understand the importance of keeping lions alive, including that lions draw tourists to the area, which provides jobs. Guardians also help farmers strengthen corrals where they keep their livestock. They also help find and safely return lost livestock. These measures have prevented livestock deaths and, more importantly, retaliatory lion killings. ""Becoming a Lion Guardian is a rebirth for (the Massai). They gain even more prestige than they would have from killing a lion,"" Hazzah said. Most Maasai warriors come to Lion Guardians illiterate, having never attended school. Hazzah and her team teach each one how to read and write. The guardians also learn about ""their"" lions; they keep data on the lions' movements and population changes as part of their job. Director of Science and co-founder Stephanie Dolrenry works with the guardians to study and name their lions and provides the technical field training and equipment the guardians need to monitor the lions. For Hazzah, watching the transformation of young Maasai warriors has been one of the most rewarding parts of her efforts. ""We never imagined when we first started Lion Guardians that we could transform these killers to the point where they would risk their own lives to stop other people from killing lions,"" she said. Hazzah said the Lion Guardian program has had great success in the Amboseli region of Kenya. When used alone or with other conservation programs, the program was 99% effective in stopping lion killings. ""I know we're making a difference,"" Hazzah said. ""When I first moved here, I never heard lions roaring. But now I hear lions roaring all the time."" Want to get involved?

Ahead of St. Patrick's Day, Kane and other CNN readers shared their best memories and photos from mesmerizing visits to the Emerald Isle. The green and rugged Dingle Peninsula, in the southwest of Ireland, is Kane's favorite destination, he wrote, though ""the Glens of Antrim are spectacular in November, the Ring of Kerry cannot be described adequately by James Joyce himself on a clear day in June, and the vibrancy of Galway and Westport are enough to recharge the soul as you wander joyfully from Tobercurry to Ennis."" Kane offered a few tips for the first-time visitor: . Don't be overly ambitious on your first trip. ""Pick a few towns to stay in and do several days in each. One-hundred miles between towns is not a two-hour drive as you might expect. If there are no major motorways, it could easily become a harrowing four-hour trip for the novice European driver.""

"U.S. and Canadian safety officials asked regulators on Thursday for new rules to prevent rail accidents like the one that decimated the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic last July. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada say the growing use of trains to ship highly volatile crude oil is endangering communities in both countries. ""The large-scale shipment of crude oil by rail simply didn't exist 10 years ago, and our safety regulations need to catch up with this new reality,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said in a statement. ""While this energy boom is good for business, the people and the environment along rail corridors must be protected from harm."" Forty-seven Lac-Megantic residents died and the town's center destroyed when an unattended train  hauling oil descended down a grade, derailed, and erupted in fire. The U.S. and Canadian safety agencies that investigate accidents issued an unprecedented joint recommendation calling for a series of new rules. Crude oil shipment by rail has increased over 400% since 2005, the NTSB said, citing figures from the Association of American Railroads. The growth has been spurred by increased drilling in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, Montana and adjoining provinces in Canada. Canadian safety officials still have not ruled on the cause of the Lac-Megantic derailment. But they have said the highly volatile oil in tanker cars was improperly described in shipping documents as a less flammable substance. The petroleum cruel oil was a hazardous ""Class 3, Packing Group II"" product, but was shipped as a ""Packing Group III"" product, investigators said. The misidentification explains in part why the fuel ignited so quickly after the derailment, authorities said. But investigators have not said whether the shipping error was intentional or inadvertent, and suggested it was unlikely the error made a difference since both types of fuel -- Packing Group II and III -- are shipped in the same Class 111 tank cars. Following the Lac-Megantic catastrophe, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a safety advisory and announced an operation to conduct unannounced inspections and testing of crude oil that shipped by rail. But the NTSB said it ""remains concerned the practice of mischaracterizing the packing groups of crude oil shipments may allow shippers to avoid"" security requirements. The NTSB is recommending that rail and hazardous materials safety agencies require expanded planning for railroads to avoid populated areas when shipping petroleum products when possible. It is also wants an audit program to ensure railroads have adequate capabilities to respond to ""worst-case discharges"" of products carried on a train. And it asks the government to audit shippers and railroads to ensure they are properly classifying hazardous materials and have adequate safety and security plans in place. The NTSB and its Canadian counterpart issued the safety recommendations jointly because railroad companies routinely operate crude oil unit trains in both countries and across the border.","Joint U.S./Canadian recommendation aims to prevent accidents .

"(CNN)You log on to a website and place a rush order. Minutes later, your order is processed and boxed at a warehouse. Within an hour, a speck appears on the horizon. It's an unmanned aerial vehicle -- commonly called a UAV or a drone -- and it's coming to deliver your order right to your front door. It sounds like science fiction, but it's reality -- in fact, it happened this month in China, where e-commerce giant Alibaba launched a limited pilot program using UAVs to deliver to customers who ordered a specific brand of tea. No one can say for sure whether drone delivery of consumer goods will become anything close to common. But it should concern every American when other nations are on the cutting edge of new technology and the United States is lagging behind. Drone technology is literally taking off all across the world. Foreign governments have quickly embraced its potential and have passed safety rules allowing a diverse array of commercial users to operate UAVs. Alibaba experimenting with drones for delivery is just one high-profile example of UAVs' possibility. Already, UAVs are used to help increase crop yields on farms and to inspect wind turbines, power lines and offshore drill flares. The possible applications for UAVs in the future seem constrained only by the limits of human creativity. But the United States has fallen behind in the race to explore where this new technology can take us. A big reason why is that we have been slow to adopt rules of the road for drones to address the understandable concerns some have over how best to guarantee safety and protect privacy. Indeed, safety and privacy are paramount and must be addressed in a comprehensive manner. Yet while other countries acted quickly to do so -- in some instances, years ago -- the commercial use of drones in the United States has remained illegal with the exception of a small handful of commercial users who have successfully filed for waivers at the Federal Aviation Administration. At long last, this weekend, the FAA announced a proposed regulatory framework that would permit the commercial use of UAVs. Additionally, the Obama administration released a presidential memorandum outlining rules of the road for drone privacy. I'm pleased they have finally acted with these initial steps. Unfortunately, they are long overdue, and the pace of rule setting is inhibiting America's competitiveness in the UAV technology race. For us to remain globally competitive, there's not a moment to spare: The FAA should fast-track the approval of these safety regulations and privacy protections. Until then, we'll diminish our ability to develop a potential economic driver -- and develop applications that could change the way we look at and solve some big problems. Imagine a firefighter using a UAV to gain a bird's-eye view of emergencies and use that new perspective to contain flames better. Or officials using a UAV to increase the efficiency of search and rescue operations for missing persons. Or American-made UAVs enabling the delivery of supplies such as medicine to remote, impoverished villages in the developing world, better enabling us to track and prevent diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola. For people in every corner of our rapidly changing planet, new technology is a powerful tool for economic empowerment and social mobility. Whether it's a UAV or something yet unimagined, emerging technologies are transforming the way the world works in the 21st century, providing businesses, individuals and governments with potentially game-changing opportunities. America should embrace opportunities such as these, not sit on the sidelines as other countries reap the benefits of pro-innovation policies. As technology advances rapidly, government must pick up the pace and catch up. If we don't, the United States risks forfeiting our position as the world's technology leader.","Sen. Cory Booker: Drone technology is literally taking off all across the world .
America should embrace the opportunities, Booker says ."
"What the #@!%? Some gamers uploading R-rated videos of themselves playing on the new Xbox One are learning the hard way that Microsoft is trying to crack down on cursing. Over the past few days, gamers using the Upload Studio on Xbox Live to share videos online have reported being banned from the network, at least temporarily, after using salty language. What do they think this is? ""Grand Theft Auto""? On Monday, Microsoft confirmed it's trying to clean up language in its online community. ""(W)e take Code of Conduct moderation via Upload Studio very seriously. We want a clean, safe and fun environment for all users,"" the company said in a statement. ""Excessive profanity as well as other Code of Conduct violations will be enforced upon and result in suspension of some or all privileges on Xbox Live. We remain committed to preserving and promoting a safe, secure and enjoyable experience for all of our Xbox Live members."" The statement did, however, quell a rumor that Microsoft was also monitoring direct communications such as Skype chats among players using the network. Because Skype often was one of the apps suspended, some players said they thought their behavior on the voice-calling service was being monitored. Several suspended gamers reported having full services restored after 24 hours. Not surprisingly, the announcement isn't going over well with some in the gaming community. ""Saying that swearing is not to be tolerated (at least partially) in this one area of gaming on top of a platform that is an obscenity cannon just feels squishy,"" Alex Wilhelm wrote for TechCrunch. ""Also, it's inconsistent. And as I don't think that language deemed by some as 'foul' should be banned while playing games, I don't think that it should be banned in uploaded videos of games being played."" Many online were echoing Wilhelm's initial point: How can a company crack down on profanity while at the same time promoting video games filled with the stuff? ""Xbox Live is suspending accounts for (foul) language. They don't want kids hearing four letter words as they go on a virtual killing spree,"" said Mike Frankovich on Twitter. ""If Xbox is gonna ban 12 yr olds for abusive language they just eliminated their entire fan base,"" added Twitter user Malakye Morgan.

"Bridget Cutler was still adjusting to being a new mom when she read a magazine article that changed her life. ""It was about a mother who decided to give her child up for adoption because she couldn't stand to hear her crying from hunger,"" Cutler remembered. ""I just thought that no mother should ever be faced with that choice."" It can cost close to $250,000 to raise a child in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- and that is just for the basics. It's especially tough for families in New Jersey, where one in eight people struggle to make ends meet. The following day, Cutler called her ""mom friends"" and started collecting gently used baby items. ""I had the intention, originally, of finding a local organization to donate them to that would benefit my neighbors,"" said Cutler, 34. When she did not find what she was looking for, Cutler's idea for Moms Helping Moms was born. Since 2011, the nonprofit has distributed diapers, clothing, nursing supplies and other baby essentials for hundreds of infants and toddlers in New Jersey. ""So many people have such an abundance, and so many others strive to afford even the basics,"" Cutler said. ""What we're doing is trying to bridge that gap."" A fair start in life . Moms Helping Moms started with one garage sale that Cutler held at her home -- except everything was free. The drive was a success, and she met many mothers in need and many mothers who wanted to help her build the organization. Today, Cutler and her volunteers solicit donations of new or gently used baby items in their neighborhoods. Cutler knows that it can be difficult for some parents to part with their children's things. ""I wanted to assure these people who were donating so generously to us that these things were absolutely going into hands that needed them,"" she said. Cutler finds recipients through social workers and other nonprofits. She works with homeless mothers, teen moms and families who have fallen on hard times and just need a boost. Jasmine Harding suffered complications during her last pregnancy. The mother of three was out of work for nearly 10 months, and she and her partner struggled to afford everything they needed. ""I never thought that I would be in this position. I've had a job since I was 16,"" Harding said.  ""I'm their mom, and I should be able to do whatever it is that I need to do for them."" Basic needs and beyond . At a recent Moms Helping Moms event, Harding received clothing, diapers and a stroller. Now she is able to push her 3-month-old daughter to day care before heading to her new job. For families like Harding's, the drives are not just about getting free baby gear. They provide an opportunity to get financially back on their feet. ""New clothes, diapers and wipes, they're a constant expense,"" Harding said. ""With the things that I got today, that will allow me to put that money towards something else, like my rent or my bills."" Cutler and her group aim to provide more than just goods to the moms they serve. Volunteers offer support and guidance, giving recipients a sense of community they may not otherwise have. For Cutler, a mother of two, running this nonprofit truly is a labor of love. She recently left her job to devote more time to her group's efforts. ""Every child deserves all the same things in life. They deserve all of the basics,"" Cutler said. ""If what we're doing helps bridge the gap between people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, even in a small way, then it's definitely worth all the hard work."" Want to get involved?

"Ready for Hillary, a super PAC founded by Hillary Clinton devotees, has started to grease the wheels of state politics, currying favor with local Democrats by exchanging important data about the group's supporters with Senate and House campaigns ahead of the 2014 midterms. The list exchanges are a clear attempt by the super PAC to build goodwill and to win over state parties ahead of a possible Clinton presidential run in 2016. To date, the PAC has exchanged records with campaigns in 14 different states: Six U.S. Senate campaigns, four House races, four gubernatorial campaigns and three Democratic committees and organizations, according to a person familiar with the list swaps. In return, Ready for Hillary is receiving data from each campaign and growing their list of possible volunteers and donors ahead of 2016. Representatives from the group declined to name specific campaigns with which they have swapped names, citing confidentially agreements with each campaign. Ready for Hillary has built the list a number of ways. Supporters become part of the group's voter file when they give a donation or attend an event put on by the group. The PAC has held over 500 events across the country -- the majority of which were in early presidential primary and caucus states. All of those names, emails and phone numbers, along with some other details, go into the Ready for Hillary voter file. Although seemingly simple, there is power in the names. Some political data experts argue a good data file is worth more than donations. A former state party data director, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly, said getting names from a national organization is an ""enormously helpful."" ""State parties almost never have the money to do this on their own,"" the official said. ""State parties need national folks to do it."" CNN asked a number of state parties and Senate campaigns to confirm whether they swapped names with Clinton. All failed to respond. The swaps are more than just currying favor, too. They are also an attempt by Ready for Hillary -- a group that has been criticized by some Democrats for focusing too much on 2016's presidential election -- to quell those concerns and help Democrats in 2014. More valuable than money . Democrats face a difficult map in the 2014 midterms. Winning back control of the House has all but become a pipe dream and the party is focused on maintaining control of the Senate -- an endeavor that may prove difficult. In turn, campaigns and state parties are looking for as much help as they can get. One such way is to provide campaigns with a list of politically engaged voters and volunteers in their area. Anthony Corrado, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and expert on campaign finance, said ""These names are increasingly as valuable as a contribution."" ""Campaigns are starting to realize that good names are more important than just having more dollars to spend on television,"" said Corrado, who also is a professor of government at Colby College. ""These names become people who can do the important things that campaigns can't necessarily buy."" Lists are an important, yet complex, aspect of campaigns. Once cultivated by an organization, they can be traded, sold or rented to different groups. Each list is worth a certain amount of money, too, which is given by third-party companies that house each data set. Corrado said the practice is becoming more common as power of online campaigning grows. In Ready for Hillary's case, lists are traded ""on a one-for-one basis"" for ""equal value,"" according to a person familiar with the list swaps. Good data lists do more than just activate voters and raise money. The most up-to-date voter lists connect supporters to their social media accounts and can be used to engage people through their friends and family. One senior Democratic source who has worked with data at the highest levels said this amount of detail can be critical for a campaign's messaging. ""I would argue that in this era of declining trust in politicians and political ads, the validation that comes from your friends is critical,"" the source said. Democrats have held a data advantage over Republicans for the better part of the last 10 years and President Barack Obama showed in 2008 and 2012 how critical understanding voters and the data around them can be to winning the White House. In order to win the White House in 2016 -- should she run -- Clinton will have to tap back into the Democratic advantage. Swaps help Ready for Hillary... and Hillary . List development and swapping is a practice that dates all the way back to the Watergate era and has traditionally been done by campaign committees or leadership PACs. But Hillary Clinton's possible 2016 candidacy is unique. Clinton was out of domestic politics for four years while she served as secretary of state and does not have a leadership PAC within her direct control, as is the case for other possible 2016 candidates. Enter Ready for Hillary, a group of outside supporters, former aides and excited young staffers who have spent the last year holding events across the country for a candidate who has yet to even announce her intentions. When it was founded in 2013, the group had two primary goals: Urge the former secretary of state to run for president and collect a massive amount of voter data to help that endeavor. But with time and backing from prominent former Clinton aides, Ready for Hillary has grown in popularity and its goals have evolved. The group, though, has faced some skepticism since its founding. Early on, some questioned Ready for Hillary's goals and its ties to Clinton. More recently, some Democrats have worried that the group was causing key voters to overlook 2014 in favor of 2016. Seth Bringman, Ready for Hillary's spokesman, disagrees with the latter criticism. ""From the moment our organization was created, we have sought ways to channel the massive enthusiasm around a potential Hillary 2016 campaign into helping Democratic efforts this year,"" Bringman told CNN. But words only go so far and the PAC is trying to counter questions with actions. Ready for Hillary has kept eight regional staff throughout the country, including two staffers in California, Iowa, New Hampshire and Virginia. These staffers connect with local parties and attend party conventions and meetings, regularly with checks in hand to donate from the PAC. Since May, Ready for Hillary has donated thousands of dollars to 29 different state parties, according to a source with the group. Most of these donations were upwards of $10,000, the max the group can give to a state party. But don't expect Ready for Hillary to stay focused too long on the midterms. Just days after voters go to the polls this November, Ready for Hillary will hold a strategy session in New York City for its top donors. The event is being billed as the ""premier opportunity"" for supporters to ""come together and meet one another while we wait to hear what Hillary will decide."" And the list that Ready for Hillary has been swapping is also a key piece to the group's 2016 strategy. Multiple people close to Ready for Hillary acknowledge quietly that the super PAC will likely sell, rent or swap with a hypothetical Clinton campaign. The name swaps also help if Clinton decides to run. The former first lady is the prohibitive to be the Democrats' presidential nominee in 2016. She has the highest name recognition and is ahead in every poll. What she will need to do over the next year if runs: Win over the state politicos and parties. While it is sometimes hard to believe that a few names, phone numbers and emails can curry favor among state parties, according to multiple big data experts, the names can sway state parties and local political operatives. That is what Ready for Hillary is banking on.","Pro-Clinton super PAC is exchanging data and the names of its supporters with Senate, House campaigns .

"Reclusive author Harper Lee has agreed to allow ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to be released electronically, ending what had until now been a glaring holdout in the digital library of literary masterpieces.

""This is Mockingbird for a new generation."" Nelle Harper Lee hasn't published a work in more than a half-century. She's made headlines though in steadfastly fighting to keep the rights to her intellectual property protected. In 2013, the Alabama native sued her hometown of Monroe County Heritage Museum for trademark infringement, saying it was illegally using her fame for its own gain. ""Historical facts belong to the world,"" the suit argued ""but fiction and trademarks are protected by law."" Lee also once sued a former literary agent for being ""duped"" into signing over the rights to her novel. Inspiring millions . ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is told through the eyes of Scout, the daughter of a lawyer in Maycomb, Alabama. It deals with a local attorney's relationship with his children and his community as he defends an African-American man accused of raping a white woman in the 1930s Jim Crow era. Its themes of racial injustice and waning innocence, grounded in characters possessing courage and tolerance, have inspired millions of readers. The 1960 novel -- the only one Lee wrote -- won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Academy Award-winning movie. According to HaperCollins, the novel has sold more than 30 million copies in English worldwide. It's been translated into more than 40 languages, and still sells more than 1 million copies every year. Social buzz . If social media buzz is any indication, there's considerable excitement about this classic novel coming into the 21st century. ""Thank you Harper Lee! To Kill a Mockingbird coming to a kindle near you in July! A present for us on her birthday!"" wrote Amy Feld in a Facebook post. ""Hot damn! Harper Lee okays an ebook of THE classic,"" wrote another,  Kathy Whitlock. The e-book and digital audio will be released on July 8, the date of the 54th anniversary of the book's original publication.","Lee announced her decision on her 88th birthday .

"Alzheimer's disease ravages the brain, robbing its victims not only of their memories but often their ability to do things as basic as swallowing. Now, a study of aging patients suggests its true toll may top half a million lives a year -- a figure that would put Alzheimer's just below heart disease and cancer on the list of America's top killers. The incurable, degenerative brain disease was blamed for 83,000-plus U.S. fatalities in 2010, making it the sixth-leading cause of death that year. But its true toll may be as much as six times that, said Bryan James, an epidemiologist at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago. ""Death certificates are well known to underreport deaths from Alzheimer's and other types of dementia,"" said James, the lead author of the study published Wednesday. ""The more immediate causes of death, such as pneumonia or heart attack, are usually listed, and the underlying causes of death are usually left off."" The eight-year study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Neurology, followed more than 2,500 people over 65. Of those, nearly a quarter developed Alzheimer's, and the disease was the cause of death in about 400 people, James said. Overwhelming burden, cost of Alzheimer's to triple, report says . James and his colleagues -- co-workers at Rush University in Chicago and at two California institutions, the University of California-San Francisco and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center there -- then statistically extrapolated their results to arrive at their estimate of 503,000 Alzheimer's deaths a year. By comparison, heart disease was blamed for nearly 600,000 deaths in 2010 and cancer about 575,000 -- but those numbers are going down, while deaths from Alzheimer's are going up. ""I couldn't say when, but in the next 20 years, it could catch up to cancer,"" James said. The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Illinois Department of Public Health. Dallas Anderson, who oversees population studies of Alzheimer's and dementia at the NIA, called the findings ""eye-catching."" ""People who I think are knowledgeable about the death registration system in the U.S. would not be surprised that the official number is low, but it is somewhat of a surprise to see that kind of a difference,"" Anderson told CNN. Similar studies are under way, and similar results would bolster the findings of James and his colleagues, he said. In the meantime, the results might encourage more doctors to note Alzheimer's when filling out death certificates -- something an increasing number of physicians have been doing already. ""It's just another reminder that Alzheimer's is really an important public health problem, and we need to work on it,"" Anderson said. The 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's . Keith Fargo, the science program director of the Alzheimer's Association, said the new study's mortality estimate is ""much closer to the true number."" ""The Alzheimer's Association has been saying for a long time that that 80,000 figure is a gross undercount,"" Fargo said. The new figures may help Americans realize that Alzheimer's isn't ""just about forgetfulness,"" but ""a universally fatal brain disease."" ""We think this is a solid paper that really puts the true impact of the disease into perspective,"" he added. The Alzheimer's Association, which supports more research into causes and treatments, estimates that 5.2 million Americans had Alzheimer's disease in 2013. Alzheimer's deaths went up by 68% over the past decade as mortality from other major diseases declined, and the association expects the number of people over 65 with the disease to climb to 7.1 million by 2025. In 2012, the Obama administration announced plans to pour another $156 million into Alzheimer's research. The National Institutes of Health has about $560 million currently budgeted for the work. But the Alzheimer's Association estimates the disease costs more than $200 billion per year -- and since the patients are mostly elderly, much of that is paid by the federal health programs Medicare and Medicaid. The promised increase in research funding is ""a step in the right direction,"" but not enough, Fargo said. ""Scientists have told us we need to invest $2 billion a year for 10 years if we are truly going to move the needle on Alzheimer's disease,"" he said.

"Russia and China blocked efforts of other major powers to pass a U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria Tuesday, with a dramatic dual veto thwarting a call for an immediate halt to the crackdown in Syria against opponents of President Bashar al-Assad. Nine of the 15-member council countries, including the United States, voted in favor of adopting the resolution. The Russian ambassador to the U.N. said Security Council action would be ""an intervention"" that would send the wrong message to the international community. ""I understand that my European colleagues are upset, having not obtained a resolution which they were trying to obtain,"" Russia's Vitaly Churkin told reporters afterward. ""Some capitals are being overly hasty in passing their judgment about the illegitimacy of the leaders in Syria,"" he added. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice, meanwhile, said the United States ""is outraged that this council has utterly failed to address an urgent moral challenge and a growing threat to regional peace and security."" The resolution, if passed, would have called upon Syria to stop oppressing its citizens. ""The unprecedented, aggressive language resorted (to) by certain ambassadors against my country, against the political leaders of my country, facilitated my task today,"" said Bashar Ja'afari, Syrian ambassador to the United Nations. ""This aggressive discourse reveals the prejudice in certain Western capitals against my country's political leadership,"" added Ja'afari. Security Council member countries India, Brazil, South Africa, Lebanon abstained from voting on the resolution. ""After seven months of near complete inaction in the Council, while at least 2,600 people were being killed, and thousands injured, arrested or tortured, this vote is a disgrace. By casting their veto, Russia and China are enabling the Syrian government's abhorrent repression campaign,"" said Philippe Bolopion, the United Nations director for Human Rights Watch. Meanwhile, another round of violence flared in Syria Tuesday, as reports of more deaths surfaced amid the relentless government crackdown on protesters. The nearly seven-month-long offensive has drawn world condemnation and calls to action against the government of al-Assad. And a newly formed group of army deserters has issued pleas for help from the international community. ""This regime will stay until the last drop of blood,"" said Col. Riad al-Assa'ad, head of a group of army deserters that has merged into a force called the Free Syria Army. ""But there can't be more bloodshed than there already is."" ""This is a regime built on force. And it can't be brought down but with force. We lived under it for 40 years."" At a State Department briefing in Washington before the Security Council vote, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said adoption of a U.N. resolution would send a message to the al-Assad regime that ""the violence has to stop."" ""We've been making the strongest possible case that we can to all of the U.N. Security Council members that, given the bloodshed, given the violence, given the arrests, given the torture that the Assad regime has propagated against its own people, it is overdue for the Security Council to make its views known, and we hope that is a very, very strong message that they are receiving,"" Nuland said. Also on Tuesday, three Syrian army soldiers and one civilian were killed during clashes in Jabal Al-Zawiya in Idlib province, said the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Security forces chasing wanted people killed a man in the forests of Idlib between Karouma and al-Bara. The activist group, which has a network of contacts across Syria, said fighting erupted in the morning between soldiers at a military camp in the northwestern province and armed men believed to be army defectors. The corpse of a student detained by security forces in the town last month was returned to his family, the observatory said. The group also said security forces in Al-Dar Al-Kabira village in Homs province opened fire at a security checkpoint and killed three civilians. The province is in the western part of the country. It said a 12-year-old was killed in the Homs province community of Deir Baalba. The observatory says 2,365 civilians and 680 army and security forces have been killed in the unrest since mid-March. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, another activist group, said at least nine people died, including six in Homs and three in Idlib. Government forces dispersed a student demonstration in Hasaka in the east and arrested two students and a teacher. Security forces arrested 10 youths in a demonstration in the western city of Baniyas. The LCC also reported raids and arrests in the Damascus suburbs. The activist group said there was an exchange of fire between military forces and dissident soldiers in the southern Daraa province. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said ""an armed terrorist group"" ambushed security forces in the city of Hama, in the west. Two law enforcement members were killed, and two were injured. It also said that ""an armed terrorist group"" was responsible for killing and mutilating five citizens in Homs after they were abducted and tortured. Activists blame violence engulfing Syria since mid-March on security personnel attacks. The Syrian government says armed terrorists are responsible. CNN is unable to independently verify such claims, because the Syrian government has denied international journalists access to the country. The Free Syria Army, meanwhile, is hoping for support from the United States, Europe and neighboring countries, such as Turkey. Al-Assa'ad is asking the international community to implement a no-fly zone and a naval blockade, measures similar to those taken by an international coalition against Libya. The Free Syria Army is also requesting weapons and wants the regime's frozen assets. ""Our correct strategy is to protect the demonstrations from the security forces and the shabiha ... until we bring down the regime,"" he told CNN on Monday, making a reference to pro-government forces. ""If we have a no-fly zone and a naval blockade and the weapons, we can secure an area to operate from and move forward with bringing down the regime."" Al-Assa'ad told CNN that the Syrian army ""strayed from its mission,"" and his group decided to make protection of the citizenry its mission. ""The regime was using the military as its own private army, not an army to protect Syria and the people. They turned the army into a gang that was killing people, killing innocents, destroying homes,"" he said Monday. Al-Assa'ad sloughed off the government claim about armed gangs fomenting violence. ""From the start of the revolution in Syria, we would get orders that there were armed gangs in the country,"" he said. ""But there were no armed gangs."" The Free Syria Army recently claimed responsibility for operations in Homs and Deir Ezzor in the east to protect the civilian population and harass army units to prevent them from operating effectively. Al-Assa'ad said military and security forces are ""demoralized and tired."" ""We are carrying out operations on Syrian lands. There are areas that they are unable to enter. There are many areas that they are fearful about entering. We are causing them losses."" Al-Assa'ad said defecting is a serious move to make because of the risks to defectors' families. But the numbers of army defectors are increasing. Asked whether any soldier with blood on his hands would be forgiven, Al-Assa'ad said, ""they are killing because they are being forced to. ... Many have been executed because they refused to shoot.""","Rice: U.S. is ""outraged"" after veto of Syrian resolution .

"Big Spring, Texas (CNN) -- Desperate times call for a tall, cool glass of creativity in this patch of West Texas where water is scarce and quickly disappearing. But a plan to pump millions of new gallons of drinking water into the system has many people across West Texas holding their noses. This week construction started on a $13 million water-reclamation facility. That's a fancy way of describing a treatment plant that will turn sewage wastewater into drinking water. ""That's not something I even want to think about,"" said Eunice Thixton, a Big Spring resident. ""It really doesn't sound too good."" There are three major reservoirs that provide drinking water for half a million people who live around Midland, Texas. But the drought is draining those lakes and threatens to create major water shortages in the months ahead. This is an age-old problem in the dust-hardened landscape of West Texas. For decades, oil has flowed strongly out of the ground here, but the hunt for water is a more difficult game. This is where John Grant comes in. He's the director of the Colorado River Municipal Water District, a government agency providing water for cities and towns including Odessa, Midland, Stanton, Big Spring and Snyder. Grant is essentially the salesman of the water-reclamation project. Basically he has to reassure people they're not going to be drinking their own urine. ""I see a lot of humor in it,"" Grant said. ""There was a fella over in Midland that I heard made the comment that at least he gets to drink his beer twice now."" Twelve years ago, Grant thought it was crucial to develop new sources of drinking water. Water reclamation was gaining in popularity; the specially treated wastewater is most often used to supply water for industrial uses and watering landscapes, like golf courses. Grant says water-reclamation technology has improved greatly and will be a vital part of providing drinking water for parts of the country struggling to keep reservoirs full. The water-reclamation process involves a complex series of treatment. The water will be disinfected, de-mineralized, disinfected again and mixed with water from the reservoir and then re-treated again. ""We live in a drought-prone area. You need to look at other alternatives, and that's the unique thing about this,"" said Grant. One of the reservoirs that provide water is EV Spence near the town of Robert Lee. The lake is on the only source of drinking water for the town of 1,000 people. That lake is at less than 1% of capacity. Deep, dried-out crevices are easily visible across the lake bottom. When full, the water in the EV Spence Reservoir can be 83 feet deep. Today, there are only splotches of water across the dried-out land. Robert Lee Mayor John Jacobs says the lake will stop providing water in the next six months. He doesn't have the budget to build a water-reclamation plant, but the mayor wishes he could build one of these plants even if it doesn't sit well with residents. ""I think that'll be the coming for all of us in the desert Southwest,"" Jacobs said. ""Turn the water off and see how long it takes for people to get thirsty."" The Big Spring Water Reclamation Plant will be finished by late next year. John Grant says the plant will provide 2 million gallons of new water for his sprawling district. On average, the Colorado River Municipal Water District provides 65 million gallons of water every day. But if drought conditions continue into next year, that water supply will have to be cut down to about 45 million gallons a day. There are also plans to develop two other water reclamation plants in the area, and Grant says when all three plants are finished, they could provide 20% of the area's drinking water. Grant has heard all the jokes such as, ""People are drinking pee."" And they get more unappealing than that one. But not only does Grant say the water will be safe to drink, he says it will actually taste better than West Texas' notoriously bad-tasting water. ""It will actually go through three water treatment processes before it gets back into the water system,"" Grant said. ""It really will be good-quality water."" Grant says he'll be more than happy to be the first person in West Texas to pour himself a cold glass of wastewater-turned-drinking-water.","In drought-stricken West Texas, wastewater is seen by some as a vital resource .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government said it will file criminal charges against employees of security firm Blackwater USA who were involved a gun battle in Baghdad in which civilians were killed, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said Sunday. Members of a private security company pose on the rooftop of a house in Baghdad earlier this month. The official said the charges will come within a week. It is not clear how Iraqi courts will attempt to bring the contractors to trial. The Iraqi government has no authority over private security firms contracted by the U.S. government, according to a July report from the Congressional Research Service. Order 17 from the Coalition Provisional Authority appears to shield security contractors from Iraqi laws. It states, ""Contractors shall be immune from Iraqi legal process with respect to acts performed by them pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Contract or any sub-contract thereto."" The Iraqi government claims the private contractors, who were guarding a U.S. diplomatic convoy, killed as many as 20 civilians. Iraqi officials, who claim the shootings were unprovoked, dispute Blackwater's claim that the guards were responding to an attack and said on Saturday they had a videotape showing the Blackwater guards opened fire without provocation. The incident prompted the Iraqi government to call for Blackwater's expulsion from the country and sparked anger among Iraqis.  Watch a report on Blackwater's response to the allegations » . U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said earlier this week the Blackwater employees involved in the incident were still in Iraq. Word of Iraq's intent to file charges came as no surprise. One day after the shooting, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said his government would punish those responsible. On Sunday, Rear Adm. Mark Fox, Communications Division chief for Multi-National Force-Iraq, and Dr. Tahseen Sheikhly, civilian spokesman for the Baghdad Security Operation, refused to comment on Iraq's plan to file charges. But they gave some details on a joint U.S.-Iraqi commission that would examine issues of security and safety in the aftermath of the shooting. The commission -- to be co-chaired by Iraqi Minister of Defense Abd al Qadir and Patricia A. Butenis, the charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy -- will receive the results of both a State Department investigation and the separate Iraqi investigation in the next few days, Fox and Sheikhly said. Blackwater contractors are part of the estimated 25,000-plus employees of private security firms who are working in Iraq, guarding diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials. As many as 200 security contractors have been killed in Iraq, according to U.S. congressional reports. Blackwater resumed its normal operations of providing security to U.S. civilian authorities in Iraq on Friday after a hiatus sparked by concerns among Iraqi and U.S. government officials over last weekend's shootings. Sheikhly said the Iraqi government has allowed Blackwater to again operate in the streets of Iraq because, otherwise, U.S. troops would have to be pulled from the field to provide security. Meanwhile, 19 bodies were found by Iraqi police in Baghdad over the weekend, an Interior Ministry official told CNN on Sunday. The total number of bodies reported to be found in the capital this month is 251.  E-mail to a friend .

"Attorney General Eric Holder is spending his remaining time in office as an activist for civil rights and social justice issues, ranging from gay rights to changing sentencing laws for non-violent crimes. If all goes as planned, it could help change his legacy. The key mile-marker in Holder's five-year tenure is President Barack Obama's February 2011 decision -- with Holder's recommendation -- to quit legally defending the Clinton-era Defense of Marriage Act. The law required the federal government to deny recognition of same-sex marriages. That decision, which came at a time when the President said he was still ""evolving"" on whether to support such marriages, eventually led to the Supreme Court's ruling last year that overturned the law. And it led to Holder's announcement in recent weeks to extend spousal benefits to same-sex married couples in all federal legal matters. Is same-sex marriage no longer a political issue? For Holder, 63, it's a way to carve out a modern civil rights legacy. In discussing his gay-rights efforts, he often mentions his sister-in-law, who in 1963 made history as one of the two black students who integrated the University of Alabama under federal armed guard. A portrait of a Justice Department prosecutor who stood watch on the university steps that day hangs in Holder's personal office in a fifth-floor corner of the Justice Department headquarters named for Robert F. Kennedy. Holder and his supporters have eagerly embraced the RFK legacy as a comparison. ""When you look at his entire record, Eric Holder will have done more to expand justice in the United States than any attorney general since Bobby Kennedy,"" says Matthew Miller, a former aide to Holder who remains close to the attorney general. It's not the way his critics have portrayed him, particularly during some of the rocky periods of his tenure. For a time, he was involved in fights with Republicans and White House rivals over a variety of national security issues. And he survived a bruising battle with House Republicans over the ""Fast and Furious"" gun trafficking controversy, including becoming the first sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress. ""I've had some days that have been better than others,"" Holder told CNN in a November interview. But added that now, ""There's the ability to focus on issues now that really matter to me."" Among those issues is working to change sentencing guidelines to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases, pushing for rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners, and getting rid of the disparity in the way the justice system deals with defendants charged in cocaine and crack cocaine crimes. Holder also recently made a public push for states to more quickly restore voting rights to felons after they've completed their sentences and probation. He is joined in that effort by Sen. Rand Paul and other conservatives who've similarly view it in line with their views on expanded individual rights. Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights . Following Holder's plea, Alabama's Republican governor said he could support such an idea, and a modified proposal in Paul's home state of Kentucky has begun moving through the legislature. But Holder's moves to use administrative memos to make effective changes before Congress passes new laws have also generated criticism. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey told CNN's Jake Tapper in an August interview that ""I generally agree with the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums. ... But the way to do that is to pass a law, not to say you're going to disregard the law."" Sen. Charles Grassley similarly has criticized Holder and the Obama administration for taking action without waiting for Congress. But the department's decision to not defend the federal ban on same-sex marriage has since become emulated in states, including Virginia and Oregon. Those moves could propel the issue back to the Supreme Court in the next two years. Holder's most aggressive moves have come in recent weeks with an aggressive interpretation of last year's Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage. After much internal debate, Holder decided the department would give full equal treatment to same-sex married couples, going so far as extending the right to refuse to provide incriminating testimony against a spouse, a bedrock right for married couples. Earlier this month, Holder basked in applause in a New York City hotel ballroom where he announced the department's latest decision on same-same marriage legal rights. The Human Rights Campaign, which held the event, praised him, by saying the decision ""cements his place in history alongside Robert F. Kennedy, another attorney general who crusaded for civil rights.""","Attorney general aggressively pushing civil rights and social justice issues .

"Your Facebook ""likes"" might be revealing more than you know about your private life. It is possible to predict potentially private traits such as a person's sexual orientation, political leanings, religion, intelligence, emotional stability and even if they abuse drugs or alcohol, just by analyzing their Facebook likes, according to a new study out of the University of Cambridge. Liking something on Facebook is a simple, almost mindless way to pass time on the social networking site, which says it has more than a billion users worldwide. With one click, people can ""like"" pages -- for brands, public figures, memes, music and groups -- as well as articles, photos or status updates from their friends. But that quick action can be a powerful statement. ""Facebook likes have a meaning that we can use to understand the psychology behind what people do,"" says David Stillwell, a co-author of the study. Researchers looked at the Facebook profiles and likes, along with surveys and personality tests, for 58,466 individuals. Using that data, they developed a model that predicts personal attributes from Facebook likes with impressive accuracy. It has the best luck categorizing people as Caucasian or African-American (95% accuracy), followed by gender, male sexuality, Democratic or Republican leanings, and detecting Christians and Muslims. One of more unusual categories was whether a person's parents had split before they turned 21, which had a relatively low 60% level of accuracy (still high enough to benefit advertisers, noted the researchers). These people were more more likely to like statements about relationships, such as ""If I'm with you then I'm with you. I don't want anybody else,"" and ""I'm sorry I love you."" ""It gives us a poignant insight into the effects that parental breakup has on children even after they grow up,"" says Stillwell. The likes themselves are a combination of obvious and baffling. Liking ""Kathy Griffin,"" ""Juicy Couture,"" or the musical ""Wicked"" were found to be strong indicators that a man was gay, while liking sports-related topics, ""Bruce Lee"" and ""Being Confused After Waking Up From Naps"" were more popular with straight men, according to the the study. A person's Facebook likes can also be used to predict intelligence, say the researchers. Liking ""The Daily Show,"" ""science,"" ""Morgan Freeman's Voice"" and the mysterious ""Curly Fries"" indicates someone is highly intelligent. Lower intelligence was suggested by likes for ""Clark Griswold,"" ""Harley-Davidson"" and ""Bret Michaels,"" according to the study. Likes for ""beerpong,"" ""Chris Tucker"" and ""cheerleading"" were strong predictors of an extrovert while ""role playing games,"" ""Anime"" and ""Voltaire"" pointed to introverted personality types. ""Kurt Donald Cobain"" and ""Vampires Everywhere"" indicated neurotic personalities, ""Wes Anderson"" and ""serial killer"" were liked by spontaneous people, and competitive types liked ""Sun Tzu"" and ""I hate everyone."" Researchers are opening up the tool to everyone so they can get a peek at their own personal results. People can check out what their Facebook likes say about them by visiting YouAreWhatYouLike.com and logging in with their Facebook profile. The site does an instant personality test and rates how open, stable, agreeable, extroverted and conscientious a person is. While the data is analyzed by researchers to improve the overall test, any personal information is stripped out. Don't try judging friends based on individual likes, however. Researchers looked at all of a person's likes to make their predictions, and even then the tool isn't perfect. ""It's like meeting someone for a blind date: If you just ask one question then you can't make an accurate judgment about them. But once you've had an hour-long conversation about their favorite hobbies, interests, brands, and celebrities, then you can start to have some confidence in who they are,"" says Stillwell. The more likes a person has made, the easier it is to accurately predict these larger nuggets of information about their personalities. Profiles used in this study had anywhere from one to 500 likes on the social network, though the average number of things people liked was 170. The data was collected by a site called myPersonality, which turns serious data gathering for academic research purposes into fun quizzes. A similar MIT experiment in 2009 predicted whether people were gay based on who they had friended on Facebook. At the time, the concept of deducting potentially private information about someone was more shocking. These days, it's becoming more common and expected. Stillwell says companies are already using these kinds of machine-learning models to make connections, though the companies may not know that they're measuring IQ or extroversion. Companies like Google and Facebook decide what ads to show people by using scraps of information they gather as users go about their regular browsing and clicking routines. Amazon recommends products by looking at a customer's Amazon browsing history and past purchases. The next step is connecting all the dots and gathering clues about a person to create a more complete picture of who they are. There are potential positive benefits, such as custom recommendations for movies and restaurants based on your location and what you've enjoyed in the past, or ads that only pitch products you might actually want to buy. But there is also a loss of privacy when data is collected about people without their permission. Gleaning potentially sensitive information about someone that isn't explicitly shared, such as sexual orientation or drug use, could be abused by companies as well as governments and potential employers. ""My biggest concern is that people do not realize what is possible, so they think that frivolous behaviors such as liking something cannot possibly say anything important about them,"" says Stillwell.","New study uses Facebook likes to predict private personality traits such as sexuality .
The technology could be used for more customized online services in the future .
But there is also great potential to abuse this kind of information ."
"As expected, Facebook has launched a Snapchat-like mobile app that lets users trade ephemeral photo- and video-based messages. But that's not what's most interesting about it. With the new app, called Slingshot, you can't view an incoming message until you respond with a photo or video of your own. That's right: There can be no passive users on Slingshot, which is basically forcing its community to trade photos and video clips, quid pro quo, like schoolkids exchanging stickers or lunchbox snacks. ""With Slingshot, we wanted to build something where everybody is a creator and nobody is just a spectator,"" its creators said Tuesday in a blog post announcing the app. ""When everyone participates, there's less pressure, more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences."" Judging by initial reaction, however, at least some users may find this stricture a little annoying. ""It's frustrating, not exciting when a friend sends you a shot and you can't immediately view it,"" wrote Ellis Hamburger in tech-news site The Verge. ""Slingshot is a new and strange example of a messaging app that raises barriers instead of tearing them down, and increases the friction to viewing a friend's photo instead of reducing it."" In fairness, the app is designed not for sending urgent information -- we have texting or even phone calls for that -- but for exchanging spontaneous moments or snippets of creativity. Facebook said Slingshot is available in the United States, starting Tuesday, on iPhone (iOS7) and Android (Jelly Bean and KitKat). A spokeswoman said the app will roll out to other countries in the future. Slingshot, which leaked briefly last week before Facebook pulled it offline, is the social networking giant's latest attempt to compete with Snapchat, a rival messaging app that is popular with teens and young adults. Snapchat is estimated to have more than 30 million users and reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook last fall. Facebook later went on to buy WhatsApp, a messaging app that's especially widespread overseas. Slingshot succeeds Poke, a messaging app that Facebook launched in 2012 and shut down last month after it failed to gain traction with users. Slingshot messages are photo and video only, although users can superimpose bits of text on the images. Like Snapchat (and Poke), Slingshot messages aren't meant to be saved. They vanish once the user responds to them or swipes them away -- a slight distinction from Snapchat messages, which by default disappear after a few seconds. ""Photos and videos that don't stick around forever allow for sharing that's more expressive, raw and spontaneous.  We can connect the same way we like to live: in the moment,"" Facebook said in its post, which takes the unusual step of crediting its competitor. ""We've enjoyed using Snapchat to send each other ephemeral messages and expect there to be a variety of apps that explore this new way of sharing,"" it said. Unlike Snapchat, Slingshot allows users to send, or ""sling,"" messages to multiple friends at once. A push notification will appear when somebody sends you something, but you'll only see a pixelated image until you respond.","Facebook launches Slingshot, a mobile messaging app for photos, videos .

"(CNN) -- Kate Ryan's fiancé will not let her live down the fact that she chose a hotel for their weekend getaway from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to New York based on the teenage drama ""Gossip Girl."" Ryan, a 26-year-old public relations executive, watches the CW show regularly. Like many viewers this past season, she took notice when the show's resident bad boy, Chuck Bass, opted to invest in some New York real estate, the very real Empire Hotel on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ""We walked into the lobby and my fiancé was like, 'Oh, now I know why you wanted to stay here, even though this hotel is in a horrible neighborhood,' "" Ryan recalled. It is women in their 20s and early 30s, like Ryan, who have built a fan base for ""Gossip Girl"" and who are now driving traffic to the hotel across the street from Lincoln Center. While hotels in New York have been suffering over the past six months because of the nationwide recession and an increase in the supply of hotel rooms in the city, The Empire Hotel has seen a 5 to 10 percent increase in bookings and a 50 percent increase in Web site traffic since September. The marriage between property and television show began last summer when the production company called David Bowd, the president of hotels for Amsterdam Hospitality, which owns the Empire Hotel, and said it was looking for a hotel for location filming and also to include as a quasi-character on the show. ""They were looking at three major competitors of ours at the time,"" Bowd said. ""They finally picked us and I thought it was a great match for the hotel because we already catered to a young, affluent crowd in New York City with our rooftop lounge."" The show started filming quietly in the hotel's rooms and lobby over the summer. The hotel made its TV debut at the start of the fall season when Chuck Bass began living and working out of the hotel. Its bright red sign is featured prominently on the show. ""My phone never stopped ringing from folks in the industry asking 'Really?' "" Bowd said. ""But I thought it was a great idea. I watched as a woman around 17 years old came to stay at the hotel with her mother. She didn't realize that the show would be filming and she nearly hyperventilated right there in the lobby."" It is girls like that and women like Ryan who are driving traffic to the hotel these days. That is an invaluable asset as tourist traffic is up and business travel is down. ""I think that teenagers can dictate where their parents stay over vacation and we saw a lot of that over the Thanksgiving holiday and into the bookings for Christmas and New Year's,"" Bowd said. Alanna Lopez manages the front desk and concierge service for the Empire and said there is no shortage of guest questions about the show during the room booking process. ""The standard questions we get are about how often the cast shoots and when they will be back. A lot of people call just wanting to know if they really shoot here in the hotel or whether they just use the name, and I have to tell them that yes, they really do shoot on location here,"" Lopez said. On site, most of the questions Lopez and her staff are asked don't come from starstruck teenagers. They come from women Ryan's age. ""The questions here come from girls in their 20s and 30s. They want to know if Chuck Bass is really as cute as he is on the show and if the girls are actually skinny in person,"" Lopez said. When the show's stars, Blake Lively, Leighton Meester and Ed Westwick, are at the hotel filming, it isn't unusual for crowds of around 400 people to gather outside the hotel's entrance on West 63rd Street. The Empire's boom comes amid an overall decrease in occupancy for hotel rooms throughout the rest of New York. John A. Fox, a senior vice president with PKF, a consulting hotel advisory firm, reviews hotel numbers every day. He noticed an uptick in the Empire's numbers recently but had not thought to attribute it to the hotel's guest appearance in a television show. Fox said the rest of New York's hotels are just starting to put the dark days behind them. Compared to the Empire's increased sales, occupancy for the city as a whole has been at 81 percent, down 5 points from 86 percent last year. Additionally, room rates have been down, decreasing by around $70 last year. The change, Fox said, comes from the replacement of business travelers to the city with the kind of tourists who are flocking to the Empire. ""You can compare it to what 'Sex & the City' did for the shoes [of] Manolo Blahnik,"" said branding expert Todd Brenard of The James Group. ""It increases the awareness of the hotel to a national audience and people who are loyal viewers of the show will want to experience in their lives what they see the characters experiencing. Plus people who are new to New York will already feel like they know the hotel and that is comforting for out-of-town travelers."" The hotel's staff has been enjoying capitalizing on its newfound fame. They hired cocktail consultant Somer Perez to concoct a menu of ""Gossip Girl""-themed cocktails for the property's rooftop bar and lounge, including the ""I'm Chuck Bass,"" a mix of Dewar's Scotch and apple cider that the menu promises will start out sweet and turn sour, much like the character played by Westwick.","New York's Empire Hotel is regularly featured on the CW's ""Gossip Girl""

"Months after a surprise ruling from a Mexican judge made him a free man, U.S. authorities have placed a new bounty for the capture of accused Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero. The U.S. State Department says it will pay up to $5 million for information leading to Caro Quintero's arrest or conviction. Caro Quintero, 61, once leader of Mexico's now-defunct Guadalajara Cartel, is accused in the 1985 kidnapping and killing of DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. He'd served 28 years of a 40-year sentence for the killings when a judge in Mexico's Jalisco state overturned his conviction in August. ""Caro Quintero was the organizer and mastermind of this atrocious act, and his unexpected release from a Mexican prison was shocking and disturbing to law enforcement professionals on both sides of the border,"" DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement Tuesday. She said the U.S. government ""will utilize every tool available, including the State Department Narcotics Rewards Program, to bring Caro Quintero to justice."" After a meeting in Washington in September, Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam promised that authorities in his country would reapprehend Caro Quintero. But there's been no word on the accused drug lord's whereabouts since then. The Drug Enforcement Administration described Caro Quintero as fugitive from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on felony murder and kidnapping charges, in addition to other criminal charges. On August 9, a Mexican federal court overturned Caro Quintero's conviction, ruling that he had been incorrectly tried in the country's federal judicial system, when he should have been tried at the state level. The slayings decades ago profoundly damaged U.S.-Mexico relations and remained a sore spot in the drug war. And the drug lord's release in August infuriated U.S. officials once again. The U.S. Justice Department said freeing Caro Quintero was ""deeply troubling"" and it would ""vigorously continue its efforts to ensure"" that he faces charges for his crimes.","Rafael Caro Quintero, a former cartel leader, is accused of killing a DEA agent .

"After pelting parts of Texas with snow and ice, a rare deep South winter storm moved into Louisiana on Friday, icing roads and causing at least two deaths. Louisiana State Police closed I-10 at the Texas border after numerous traffic accidents blamed on ice. The interstate closure was one of many hampering travel in the state Friday afternoon as state police warned of deteriorating conditions. They warned residents to avoid driving unless it was absolutely necessary. State police said two people died in traffic accidents attributed to the weather. The agency's Facebook post didn't provide details about the incidents. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for southwest and south-central Louisiana through Friday evening. As much as a half-inch of ice is possible, the agency said. Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency because of the storm. State offices were closed in 38 parishes, according to the governor's office. Schools were closed in 37. Earlier, the storm made trouble in Houston, a city so unaccustomed to wintry weather that it's only had three bouts with measurable snow since 1968. One Twitter user jokingly posted: ""Ice on my windshield. Anything I can do or should I just bust it out with a hammer?"" Although the winter storm warning had been lifted for the Houston area Friday afternoon, forecasters warned that bridges, overpasses and other wet spots could freeze again after dark on Friday. 'Stay off the roads' Icy conditions remained sketchy. ""We still have ice on the roads and overpasses. A lot of roadways are closed, and nearly all of our interstates have ramp closures or lane closures because of the overpasses,"" said Michael Walter, a spokesman for Houston's emergency management agency, said. ""If you don't need to be on the roads, stay off them,"" he added. Icy conditions also caused delays at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, he said. About 100 flights have been delayed. High winds associated with the storm also forced the U.S. Coast Guard to suspend shipping through the Houston Ship Channel. While the channel remained closed Friday morning, the Coast Guard hoped to have it reopened by afternoon, Lt. Ashley Bullard said. About 50 ships pass through the channel each day, Bullard said. About 200 miles northwest of Houston, the U.S. Army closed sprawling Fort Hood, telling all but mission-essential personnel to take the day off. In Madison County, north of Houston, the National Weather Service said nearly an inch of snow was on the ground. Huntsville also got about an inch of snow overnight, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. In San Antonio, icy conditions were causing problems for commuters. About a tenth of an inch of rain fell overnight, freezing on surfaces and making many roads slippery, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. School closings . In Texas and Louisiana, many school districts closed for what amounted to a snowless snow day for hundreds of thousands of kids. ""Yay for long weekend,"" Twitter user lauraface13m posted Friday morning. ""What? Oh yeah ... no! No snow has actually fallen. It's just cold and rainy. Close enough."" In Austin, Texas, schools were closed amid icy conditions that caused more than 200 wrecks, CNN affiliate KVUE reported. Indiana pileup . Winter weather caused more serious problems on Thursday in Indiana, where three people died in a 46-vehicle accident in whiteout conditions on Interstate 94, state police Sgt. Ann Wojas said Friday. Twenty-two people were injured, two critically. The accident -- which was said to have involved 20 trucks and 26 private vehicles -- stretched for more than a mile, according to Lt. Jerry Williams, district commander for the Indiana State Police. A fire official who responded to the crash told reporters ""we're lucky there wasn't 210 people dead and three injured."" It took firefighters hours to rescue all of the victims, including two who were airlifted to nearby hospitals in critical condition. Wojas identified the dead as Marilyn Wolma, 65 and her husband, Thomas Wolma, 67, both of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Gerry Dalrymple, 65, of Chicago. The interstate's eastbound lanes remained closed early Friday, the Indiana Department of Transportation said. Officials hoped to reopen the lanes Friday morning, but it will take much longer to fully understand what happened and why, Wojas said. ""This investigation will take several weeks, if not months, to complete,"" she said. Officials have removed the last vehicle involved in the wreck, CNN affiliate WLS reported. Propane shortages . Also, propane shortages across the country are causing prices to spike, pinching consumers looking to keep ahead of bitter cold winter weather in many places. ""We have double blankets on the beds, the couch, the kids' beds. I don't know what else to do,"" said Sandy DeHorn, who said prices for propane rose from $2.69 to $5 in one day. ""How can that happen?"" she said. Alabama's governor declared a state of emergency related to propane sales, activating the state's price-gouging law. The law doesn't set a specific limit for prices but says anything more than 25 percent above the average price over the last month represents illegal ""unconscionable pricing."" More than 12 million U.S. households use propane to keep warm, according to an industry trade group. Supplies are short because of increased demand due to the cold weather and increased usage by corn farmers last fall, who used extra propane to dry a bumper crop of corn.

"President Barack Obama dismissed criticism he doesn't spend enough time developing relationships with Washington deal-makers who can help push his agenda forward. In an exclusive interview with CNN chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin, Obama said he is determined to make time for his family. ""Sometimes Michelle and I not doing the circuit and going out to dinners with folks is perceived as us being cool,"" Obama said. ""It actually really has more to do with us being parents."" The president has been criticized from all sides for failing to achieve more bipartisanship, especially given his 2008 campaign pledge to bridge partisan and ideological divides once in office. Some of the president's frustrated allies have complained that a seeming reluctance to build relationships with more members of Congress and Washington insiders has made it difficult for him to get business done. Romney gets more personal . In the interview, which will air as part of the documentary ""Obama Revealed: The Man, The President,"" Obama suggested he is willing to build those relationships, but often turns down social engagements because he prioritizes time at home with his children. ""Sometimes on the weekends, we may turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we're trying to carve out family time,"" Obama said. ""And I think that's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to be out there slapping backs and wheeling and dealing. That really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives."" Asked if things would change if he's elected to a second term, Obama said, ""My hope is that getting past this election, people will have an opportunity to maybe step back and say, 'You know what?  The differences that divide us aren't as important as the common bonds we have as Americans.' "" ""And some of that I'm sure will require additional effort on my part.  Hopefully, we'll see more effort on the other side, as well,"" he added. David Maraniss, who penned biographies of former President Bill Clinton and Obama, said the current president ""is not going to become this great transactional politician,"" like Clinton. ""Bill Clinton was imbalanced. He would spend the hours between 6:00 and 9:00 (p.m.) talking to people in Congress,"" Maraniss said. ""Whereas President Obama is basically with his family during those hours, which is sort of a balanced thing to do but not necessarily good for a president."" One of the president's closest friends and aides, Valerie Jarrett, said Obama ""wants to be the kind of dad he never had."" The president has been slammed by Republicans for what they consider an unwillingness to compromise, particularly in legislative matters. Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, who worked closely with the president early in his term, said she is not sure Obama ""truly understands the relationship and interaction that occurs between the president and the legislative branch."" ""Somehow, he thinks, well, the Congress is, you know, that's their job and this is my job,"" Snowe said. ""But we have to really interact with one another, ultimately, to get the job done for the country."" The president said he repeatedly reached out across the aisle in the hope of achieving bipartisan solutions, even at the expense of condemnation from members of his own party. It was the GOP, he said, that made reaching across party lines nearly impossible. ""If anything, I think I received a lot of criticism from my own party for going out of my way to try to solicit Republican cooperation,"" Obama said. ""The fact of the matter was that politically there was a decision that was made fairly early on, among some of their leadership, that said working with the president is not good politics.""","Obama has been criticized for failing to build relationships with Washington insiders .

"Abby Rodgers walked out to her date's car and found roses, a teddy bear and a card sitting in the passenger's seat. Inside the card was the million-dollar question: Will you go to prom with me? The 17-year-old high school senior was touched. Everyone at her all-girls private school in suburban Philadelphia was hoping for some sort of ""promposal,"" the act of inviting someone to prom in an elaborate fashion, often involving props, dancing flash mobs or maybe even police or actor Bryan Cranston. In the moment, Rodgers said yes, ""because it was such a nice gesture and he was so sweet and brave to go through with it."" Later that evening, when she had a chance to process what had happened, she realized she didn't actually want to go with him. ""I realized that prom is more of a couples atmosphere,"" she said. ""I didn't want to be there with someone I was not in a close relationship with."" While prom is a great excuse to dress up, party with friends and mark the passage of another school year, the annual rite of passage also carries a lot of pressure -- to look perfect, arrive in style and have the ideal date on your arm. Promposals can add to the pressure, becoming almost as important as prom itself and raising expectations for young men and women, especially when they get posted on social media for all to see. Sure, some promposals can be thoughtful, charming or downright heartwarming. They can teach teens to take healthy risks and nurture their romantic side in the hookup-culture era. But, as with anything, it's all about intention. ""As promposals have become more elaborate and public, so, too, does the potential for increased humiliation and social pressure,"" said Jarrod Chin, director of training and curriculum of Northeastern University Sport in Society, a nationwide youth mentoring program that focuses on violence prevention and healthy relationships. ""As promposal clips go viral, more and more young people think that you need to create these elaborate schemes to ask someone to prom and the reality is that it should be just a fun event for young people to dance and celebrate."" Going all out and all in . What used to be a potentially awkward phone call or hallway conversation is becoming an extremely public ceremony with high stakes. For some girls (and, even some boys), not getting a promposal is their worst nightmare. And yet, being approached with flowers in the hallway can be a letdown, especially if a friend was serenaded in a flash mob. For others, these grandiose public gestures put invitees on the spot, forcing them to accept even if they don't want to for fear of being perceived as mean or stuck up. Opinion: The damaging message of proms . Boys also face pressure to be creative and do whatever it takes to get a yes. That's the whole point, after all. Sometimes, the effort comes from a genuine desire to make the invitee happy and have fun doing it. Other times, the point really is to force a yes. Massachusetts high school senior Sam Casey has seen it go both ways. Friends in relationships have staged promposals for the fun of it. He's also seen classmates do them in front of invitees' families to get a yes where they probably would not have received one otherwise. ""It takes a lot for a guy to put himself out there for a girl, and they want to do everything they can to make sure they're not humiliated,"" he said. ""By doing it in a special way, or publicly showing that he really wants to go with that person, 99% of the time the girl will say yes."" Either way, it can be a source of stress for both sides, Casey said. ""I think it's gotten to the point that if you don't do it, you'll have a hard time finding a date,"" he said. If the answer is no, the emotional fallout can be damaging, Chin said. Programs such as Sport in Society's Mentors in Violence Prevention work with teens nationwide on how to have mature conversations with potential love interests and how to deal with a breakup or rejection. ""If their identity could potentially be challenged by a 'no' to prom, we need to provide young men with the skills and ability to handle what could be a really embarrassing and traumatic public refusal,"" Chin said. That's where parents and adults come in, he said, to talk about realistic expectations around prom dating in general. ""As adults, we shouldn't minimize promposals or teen relationships as puppy love or harmless crushes,"" he said. ""Instead, we should view (them) as the first steps in developing intimate relationships, and how they handle them sets the stage for more complicated situations, like long-term dating, breakups, marriage and divorce."" Testing the waters . Not all promposals are bad or ill-intentioned. To avoid potential embarrassment or hurt feelings, teens often put out feelers among friends to see if their potential date is interested. In best-case scenarios, the person knows what's coming; it's just a matter of how and when, said University of Pennsylvania freshman Ria Desai. ""I didn't feel any pressure to say yes because I already knew he was going to ask me,"" said Desai, who accepted a promposal in 2012 from a close friend during dance class. ""In that way it was fun because I didn't know how he was going to ask me; it was a surprise."" Promposals get iffy when the other person has no clue as to what's coming, she said. In those situations, some girls say yes in the moment but then later turn down the guy in private. The alternative of public rejection can be worse for the girl, Desai wrote in a 2012 blog post for SPARK Summit, a girl-fueled activist movement that challenges media portrayals of women. ""Turning him down marks her as a 'huge bitch,' a label she doesn't deserve in any way. Yes, rejecting him will hurt his feelings, but doesn't every girl deserve the chance to make the decision that she wants to make?"" she wrote. Further raising the stakes, though, is the ""necessity"" of capturing the event as a picture or video so it can be shared on social media, said Ohio State University freshman Melinda Vercollone, whose 2013 promposal came in the form of a ""prom"" sign underneath the hood of a friend's car. Her twin sister got asked when a boy showed up at their home shirtless on a moped with roses in his mouth while his friends filmed the whole thing. ""The filming was important; it's sort of a necessity to put something on Facebook or Instagram so everyone will know who asked who and when and how. It's also critical that everyone watches the video so the next boy doesn't accidentally copy a proposal that has already been done,"" Vercollone said. ""I remember being so happy that I was asked to prom, but also so disappointed that no one had been there to see it or to take a cute picture of us and post it on Facebook."" The pressure to couple up . Rodgers, the suburban Philadelphia teen, has nothing against promposals, especially among friends and couples. They have great potential to be sweet or thoughtful when done the right way. That's what caught her off guard about her date's promposal. They knew each other through mutual friends, but she knew in her heart that she did not want to bring someone she was not serious about to prom. She discovered this at her junior prom, when she brought a guy she didn't know well because she didn't want to be the only person without a date. They didn't really hit it off. ""I realized I would rather go alone or with my friends,"" she said. This year, Rodgers faced pressure from various corners to bring someone. Even her grandparents offered to attempt to set her up with a busboy from their favorite restaurant. ""It's almost taboo at my school to go alone."" Inspired by a friend who decided not to bring a date, Rodgers texted her date two weeks after his promposal and told him she changed her mind. He took it well, she said, and he found another date for his prom. Rodgers ended up going to hers without a date last week. She had a great time dancing and posing for pictures with her friends, including others who went alone. ""It was amazing. I have no regrets,"" she said. ""To girls who get promposed to and don't know what to do, I would just say you only have one prom. Think about what's going to make you happy and remain true to who you are.""","""Promposals"" are becoming almost as important as prom itself .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- As one of the highest officials in the Mexican Catholic Church, Monsignor Victor Rene Rodriguez has been receiving the alarming reports from all over the nation. His priests are telling him they are being constantly threatened, extorted and abused by drug traffickers. ""Sometimes threats don't materialize,"" Rodriguez said. ""But in cases where priests haven't obeyed the drug traffickers' demands, churches have been damaged, priests attacked, and, in a few cases, even killed."" Monsignor Rodriguez is the secretary general of the Mexican Conference of Bishops and the Bishop of Texcoco. He says some fellow bishops have opted for canceling early evening masses to protect parishioners from the drug violence. Rodriguez points to states like Chihuahua, the most violent in Mexico. Of the 28,000 drug-related deaths in the last four years, 40 percent have happened in this border state. In Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, more than 100 pastors have reported threats, and extortion has become all too common. About 90 percent of Mexico's total population of 110 million people describe themselves as Catholic. In fact, Mexico has the second largest population of Catholics in the world. But the threats are affecting evangelical churches as well. The Rev. Jose Raul Murillo, head pastor at the Faith in Jesus Christ Apostolic Church in Juarez, says pastors are falsely accused of siding with certain gangs. ""They threaten us,"" he said. ""They accuse us of siding with La Linea [drug gang] or La Familia [rival gang]. They also tell us, 'You have to cooperate with us or we will kill you.' "" Monsignor Rodriguez also says priests are forced to minister to drug traffickers. ""They give the orders,"" he said. ""They say, 'We will pick you up. We need you to minister.' And there have been cases where a priest has been unable to go to perform a baptism ritual or a first communion and his church has suffered the consequences."" The families of priests are being threatened as well, Rodriguez said. The Mexican Catholic Church has adopted several measures to minimize the risks to priests caused by drug violence. For example, priests are being asked to always wear clothing that identifies them as religious people and to restrict trips to remote areas.","Priests are being threatened, extorted and abused by drug traffickers, monsignor says .

"(CNN) -- Christopher Columbus has long been the poster boy Renaissance explorer who found fame and fortune by sailing from the Old World to the New. Crossing the great unknown waters between Spain and the Caribbean in 1492, he became one of the most renowned -- and pivotal -- Europeans to set foot in America. But more than five centuries later, a British adventurer plans to show that the New World could have been reached by another seafaring nation 2,000 years before Columbus. Former Royal Navy officer Philip Beale hopes to sail a replica Phoenician boat 10,000 kilometers across the Atlantic in an ambitious voyage that could challenge maritime history. By completing the journey, Beale aims to demonstrate that the Phoenicians -- the ancient Mediterranean civilization that prospered from 1500BC to 300BC -- had the capability to sail to the U.S.; a theory disputed by historians. ""It is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [before Columbus], it was the Phoenicians,"" said Beale. ""Of all the ancient civilizations they were the greatest seafarers -- Lebanon had cedar trees perfect for building strong boats, they were the first to use iron nails, and they had knowledge of astronomy and currents."" The prospect of sailing a 50-ton wooden vessel identical to those built 2,600 years ago across the Atlantic might appear foolhardy, had Beale not already challenged maritime history two years ago. Beale sailed the replica boat -- aptly named The Phoenician -- around Africa in 2010, in a bid to demonstrate the ancient civilization had the capability to circumnavigate the continent 2,000 years before the first recorded European; Bartolomeu Dias, in 1488. Setting sail from Syria in 2008, The Phoenician covered 32,000 kilometers over two years, battling everything from six-meter waves off the Cape of Good Hope to Somali pirates. ""We had run the gauntlet of pirate-infested waters, overcome numerous technical problems and traveled deep into the Indian and Atlantic Oceans,"" Beale says in a new book on the incredible voyage; 'Sailing Close to the Wind.' ""I had proved she was an ocean-going vessel and when she was coasting along the waves, her sail billowing in the wind; to captain her had been an unforgettable experience."" Beale based his ambitious quest on a quote by Greek Historian Herodotus, who claimed the Phoenicians circumnavigated Africa in 600BC. Along with their sophisticated seafaring skills, the Phoenicians were renowned as an intellectual and industrious civilization who helped develop the alphabet we still use today. Highly skilled in metalwork, ivory carving and glass-making, the name Phoenician derives from the iconic purple color they used to dye their superior textiles. Dr Julian Whitewright, maritime archaeologist at the University of Southampton, added that a Phoenician voyage around Africa was ""quite a plausible undertaking, based on the capabilities of the vessel of the period and historical material stating it took place."" The boat was modeled on an ancient 19-meter Phoenician shipwreck excavated off the coast of Marseille. Using locally-sourced materials, shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast. The crew of volunteers ranged from six to 15 people at any time, with 53 sailors from 14 different countries taking part over the entire journey. ""We didn't have any mechanical winches and the anchor had to be pulled up and down by hand -- it was back-breaking work,"" Beale said. ""There was just one traditional toilet which dropped straight into the ocean, so you literally had to step out on the side of the boat to use it. When you had big waves coming at you in the middle of the night it could be quite scary. But at least there was no cleaning."" The final leg of the journey took them wide out across the Atlantic and a mere 965 kilometers off the coast of Florida. It was here Beale got his inspiration for the journey to the U.S. ""Archeologists have found Egyptian mummies with traces of tobacco and cocaine which could only have come from the New World,"" Beale said. ""It indicates there was something going on across the Atlantic."" Dr Mark McMenamin, professor of geology at Holyoke College, also points to evidence of Phoenician coins bearing maps of the Old and New World. He said copper coins with Phoenician iconography have also also been discovered in North America. ""The available evidence suggests that the Carthaginians (the western tribe of the Phoenicians) had the ability to cross the Atlantic at will,"" he said. Many historians however, remain doubtful. ""If the Phoenicians got to England -- which we think they did -- I wouldn't be surprised if the boat could get to America physically. But whether they could have done it without running out of food is a different matter,"" maritime historian Sam Willis said. ""If you're circumnavigating Africa you can always stop along the way. But you can't when you're going to America -- it's a massive stretch of sea and that's the difference."" Setting off from Tunisia, the modern-day Phoenician vessel is expected to take two to three months to reach America -- granted Beale can raise Â£100,000 ($156,000) for the expedition. New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art has already invited him to display the boat as part of their upcoming exhibition on the Phoenicians, opening in September 2014. ""The conventional wisdom is that Christopher Columbus discovered America. But anyone who looks a little closer will see the Vikings were there around 900AD. They've found Viking settlements in Newfoundland, it's undisputed,"" Beale said. ""So Columbus was definitely second -- at best. I put forward the theory that the Phoenicians could have been first and I hope to prove that was the case.""","British adventurer aims to sail replica Phoenician sailboat across Atlantic .

"(CNN)""We cannot kill our way out of this war,"" State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said on Tuesday.   ""We need in the medium to longer term to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it's lack of opportunity for jobs ...""  Since then, Harf has been attacked by conservatives, particularly for her jobs remarks.  But she's right in her assessment. And, I would suggest, she should have gone further: There's reason to think that bombing is exactly what ISIS wants us to do. Why else would they be goading us into it? It's called ""terrorism"" for a reason. The goal is to cause terror, to scare people into acting -- or overreacting.  The most recent ISIS propaganda video was produced in English for a reason.  It seems they want the West to react and take the bait.  And we are obliging. Months ago, a war-weary United States was suddenly whipped back into a pro-military-action frenzy.  Why? Writing in Mother Jones, Kevin Drum, explained: ""All it took was a carefully stagecrafted beheading video and the usual gang of conservative jingoists to exploit it."" Longtime defense analyst Kenneth Brower made a similar point: ""A YouTube video of a beheading forces the U.S. president to go to 'war' in order to avoid being called weak by his domestic political opposition. That's not leadership! Worse, the so-called hawks push for deeper involvement irrespective of military reality. They live in a fantasy world of U.S. military exceptionalism."" ISIS then beheaded a British journalist, so the British stepped up its military support in the campaign against ISIS.  Then ISIS goaded Jordan with a video of the hideous immolation of a Jordanian pilot.  Jordan responded with bombs.  Now ISIS has just goaded Egypt with a mass execution ... and Egypt has, predictably, responded.  Anyone who doesn't see a pattern here isn't looking. Yes, the violent terrorism of ISIS is medieval and inhumane. That doesn't mean it can't also be rational. And this is where the assessment of Harf and the Obama administration -- and Republicans calling for even further military action -- falls short of the mark. Not only can we not kill our way out of this war, but killing may exacerbate the situation. Why would ISIS goad the world to attack it?  To be legitimized as a forceful threat, while at the same time provoking actions that lead to more civilian casualties when nations strike back. This provokes more rage at the West and its regional allies, drawing more martyrs and sympathizers to the terrorist cause. And we are playing into ISIS' hands: In Syria, ISIS had to put up giant screens to show its beheading videos.  But in the West, mainstream media is doing it for them, covering ISIS propaganda as 24/7 fear- mongering under the banner of news. Effective counterterrorism strategy begins with not doing what the terrorists want us to do. But right now, we are the dog being wagged by the tail of ISIS. After all, while the capacity to commit terrorism likely involves some psychosis, terrorists don't just spontaneously spring from the ground like demonic daisies.  In 2006, the National Intelligence Estimate compiled by America's top counterterrorism agencies found that the war in Iraq had, according to a Washington Post article, ""become a primary recruitment vehicle for violent Islamic extremists, motivating a new generation of potential terrorists around the world whose numbers may be increasing faster than the United States and its allies can reduce the threat."" ISIS and its ilk want to concoct an existential war between their brand of fundamentalist Islam and the rest of the globe.  The leadership of ISIS may do abhorrent things because of a crazy adherence to an apocalyptic interpretation of Islam, as Graeme Wood has just written in The Atlantic.  But they don't just slaughter people, they produce hi-definition, theatrically staged, English-language videos of the slaughter, as well as a propaganda magazine in English. America's homeland, thankfully, has not been the direct target of ISIS violence, but we have been the target of this propaganda. It's working. Recruits are flocking to ISIS. This is not to say there's no military solution to ISIS, though many experts such as Brower certainly doubt that such tactics will work.  It may ultimately be smarter to push a political solution, such as the division of Iraq and the region into new sectarian-based states, as has been proposed in the past.  Whatever the solution, what is clear is that the values and vision of America and our allies in the region should be proactively driving the agenda rather than a reactionary furor whipped up at the whim of ISIS. We have to stop broadcasting their propaganda.  We have to stop responding with bombs every time they provoke us with videotaped slayings.  We have to stop being weak and fearful in the face of ISIS' threats.  Otherwise, no matter how much territory we bomb, ISIS will keep winning. In fact, if you think the only way to defeat them is with bombing, they've already won.","Sally Kohn: Overreacting to ISIS' atrocities is what the terrorists want to aid them in recruiting .

"The counterfeits included everyday health and beauty items such as ChapStick, Johnson's Baby Oil, Vaseline and Always sanitary pads. A pair of New York brothers will appear in court Tuesday on charges of running a multimillion-dollar ring that peddled fake products distributed up and down the East Coast, authorities said. Brothers Pardeep Malik, 59, and Hamant Mullick, 60, are accused of running an enterprise whose products also turned up in Pennsylvania and Florida, according to the Nassau County District Attorney's Office. Authorities seized more than $2 million worth of products and were looking at bank accounts to determine the size of the enterprise. Law enforcement authorities seized four tractor-trailers filled with knockoff health products from five locations on Long Island on Thursday. A manufacturer described the operation as the biggest known counterfeit enterprise in the United States, while another company called it the only known such manufacturing operation in the country for its products, prosecutors said. Malik and Mullick, both charged with felony trademark counterfeiting, were being held on bond of $100,000 each, the district attorney's office said. The allegation that Malik was involved with his brother's business are ""outlandish,"" said Malik's attorney, Steve Christiansen. Mullick's attorney, Michael Brown, did not return calls seeking comment. ""Health and beauty products like lip balms, oils, shampoos and inhalers are highly regulated in order to protect consumers, but these defendants are charged with going around those protections and stealing the brands of major corporations that comply with the law,"" District Attorney Kathleen Rice said in the statement. ""These actions can endanger the public."" The fake products included ChapStick, Johnson's Baby Oil, Vicks VapoRub, Vicks Inhaler, Vaseline and Always sanitary pads; the producers of the real products include major international brands such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, prosecutors said. Other products, including over-the-counter cold medicines and painkillers, also were recovered, officials said. ""We encourage consumers to be cautious about buying branded goods that look suspicious, or from outlets that are unfamiliar,"" Chris Vuturo, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble, said in a statement. The case came to light when Valley Stream Fire Department officials in January conducted a building inspection at the site of a fire a year earlier. Nassau County Fire Marshall officials took samples of products they found and sent them to the manufacturers, who verified the counterfeits. Fire department officials said they found manufacturing supplies but no material safety data sheets, which normally accompany these supplies. The brothers are accused of selling the products to distributors who, in turn, delivered them to retailers in New York, Pennsylvania and Florida. An investigation is underway to determine if there are more locations. The prosecutor's office is trying to determine the chemical makeup of the products and the health risks, if any, associated with them. Authorities gave the following tips to identify fakes: Look for signs such as strange pictures on the package or strange colors or typeface. Some sophisticated knockoffs may be hard to detect, but the price may be atypically low. Counterfeits will not have the same quality or consistency of real products. Shop at established and trusted stores, which are likely to be connected to legitimate supply chains.","Multimillion-dollar counterfeit ring includes items such as ChapStick, Johnson's Baby Oil .

"A lawyer for Bill Cosby called the increasing number of claims of sexual assault against the legendary comedian ""ridiculous"" and said the media should stop airing ""unsubstantiated, fantastical stories."" Martin D. Singer said in a written statement sent to CNN that it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" Cosby, 77, has not faced a judge or jury, let alone been convicted, regarding any accusations. At least 10 women now have raised allegations against him. On Friday, Cosby told Florida Today he wasn't going to respond to ""innuendos,"" referring to the women's accusations. ""I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos. People should fact-check. People shouldn't have to go through that and shouldn't answer to innuendos,"" Cosby told the newspaper in a backstage interview before his sellout performance at the King Center for the Performing Arts in Melbourne. His show began to a standing ovation, and he didn't mention the allegation during his 90-minute act, the newspaper said. Stories of Cosby's purported misdeeds have been around for about a decade, but they recently got new life when another comedian took aim at him. Singer said there are plenty of attorneys who are ready to help victims file lawsuits against rich, powerful men. He blamed the media for the rise in the number of women who recently have alleged Cosby assaulted them or was sexually aggressive. ""Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?"" he asked. ""It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop."" The media is violating its own reporting standards by rushing the women's stories to air or print, he said. ""The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity,"" he wrote, adding the claims are ""increasingly ridiculous."" For decades, Cosby was thought of in glowing terms as a perceptive comedian, upbeat pitchman and genial father figure. His public personality made him more than rich -- it made him a role model, admired for his support of education and his no-nonsense talks on parenting and achievement. In recent weeks, that persona has been countered by another, much more sinister image, one Singer vehemently disputes.","""A guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos,"" Cosby tells newspaper .

"Denver (CNN)The show must go on. That was the message Bill Cosby sent Saturday night as the embattled comedian performed back-to-back shows in the Mile High city. Cosby, 77, was greeted with cheers and a standing ovation as he walked on stage wearing a gray sweatsuit with the words ""Hello Friend"" written on the front. Cosby never once mentioned the accusations of sexual assault that have cast a shadow over his reputation and career in recent months, leading to a string of show cancellations in other cities. ""He's phenomenal. An amazing man,"" said Gina Hernandez, who showed up to support the man she grew up watching on TV. ""I don't believe the allegations. I think that it's strange how everyone came forward all at one time."" The theater roared with laughter inside, while protesters outside voiced outrage and disapproval. ""This is our city and we do not stand with him. We stand with the women,"" Beth Leyba said. About 50 demonstrators gathered and marched, chanting, ""Rape is not a joke"" and ""Turn back Cosby."" They held signs that read, ""If you support Cosby you support rape"" and ""Colorado believes the women."" ""I, myself, am a survivor of sexual assault and I just find it sickening that Bill Cosby has been able to get away with this for so many years,""  Leyba said. The group of demonstrators included attorney Gloria Allred, who represents eight of Cosby accusers, including Beth Ferrier, who is from Denver and has previously shared her story with CNN. ""Many people are empowered who are here today, and I'm not going to live in fear of fame and money and power and Bill Cosby. And we're not going to let this go away and be silent in the face of what we believe is injustice. Those days are long gone,"" Allred said. Earlier Saturday, Allred held what she called a ""teach-in"" at the nearby Crawford Hotel, to share the stories of Cosby's accusers and encourage people to speak out against sexual abuse. About two dozen women have spoken out accusing Cosby of drugging and sexual misconduct that go back decades, in some cases. Cosby has never faced criminal charges. He and his attorneys have repeatedly denied the allegations. At least three of Cosby's accusers have filed a federal defamation lawsuit against him, claiming that after they came forward with allegations,  they were called liars. Cosby has no plans to change his performance schedule because of the mounting accusations and protests, according to his PR team. Promoter AEG did offer refunds to the Denver shows for those who bought tickets early and changed their minds. AEG said ""a few"" refunds had been issued, but would not provide a specific number. ""I thank you, the theater staff, the event organizers and the Colorado Community for your continued support and coming to experience family, fun entertainment. Hey, Hey, Hey -- I'm Far From Finished,"" Cosby said in a statement to his fans.","Cosby, 77, was greeted with cheers and a standing ovation .

"Almost two decades ago, a parlor game called ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" became an unlikely grass-roots phenomenon among movie buffs and foretold today's social web of online connections. Maybe the only one who was not amused by the game was Kevin Bacon himself. ""I was horrified by it. I thought it was a giant joke at my expense,"" said the prolific actor Saturday during a talk at the South by Southwest Interactive festival here. ""I appreciate it now. But I was very resistant to it (at first)."" The game, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, requires players to link celebrities to Bacon, in as few steps as possible, via the movies they have in common. The more odd or random the celebrity, the better. For example, O.J. Simpson was in ""The Naked Gun 33⅓"" with Olympia Dukakis, who was in ""Picture Perfect"" with Kevin Bacon. Inspired by ""six degrees of separation,"" the theory that nobody is more than six relationships away from any other person in the world, the game was dreamed up in 1994 by Brian Turtle and two classmates at Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania. They were watching ""Footloose"" on TV when it was followed by another Kevin Bacon movie, and then another. ""It was just one of those lightbulb moments,"" said Turtle, who joined Bacon onstage at SXSW. ""It was like, 'This guy is everywhere! He's the center of the entertainment universe.' "" After it spread among their friends, Turtle and his co-creators, Craig Fass and Mike Ginelli, managed to get booked on Jon Stewart's then-MTV show to explain the game. Meanwhile, Bacon was becoming aware of it, too. ""I started to kind of hear about it in strange ways,"" said the actor, still boyish at 55. ""People would come up to me and touch me and say, 'I'm one degree!' I didn't really know what was going on."" Bacon thought the game would be a fad. But it endured, and he eventually embraced it. ""I don't think it's a great testament to my ability (as an actor),"" he said. ""My movies just happen to be on a lot."" In 2007 Bacon launched SixDegrees.org, a charitable organization that connects celebrities with good causes for fundraising purposes. The ""Six Degrees"" game has also inspired a website, The Oracle of Bacon, which lets people type in any actor's name to see how closely they link with the ""Footloose"" actor. The site assigns each celeb a ""Bacon number"" to show the number of degrees of separation between the two. Google now lets users type ""Bacon number"" in the search field, followed by an actor's name, to produce the same result. It's rare to find a veteran actor who is not linked to Bacon in some way, and rarer still to find a Bacon number of 4 or higher. It helps that Bacon has appeared in more than 65 movies, including many with large ensemble casts such as ""Diner,"" ""Flatliners,"" ""JFK,"" ""A Few Good Men,"" ""Sleepers,"" ""Mystic River"" and ""X-Men: First Class."" Bacon, currently filming the second season of his Fox drama ""The Following,"" admitted Saturday that he occasionally needs to use The Oracle of Bacon himself. ""Whether it's my age or my misspent youth, sometimes I forget whether I've worked with somebody or not,"" he said. ""I'll look at the call sheet, check the name, and then I'll check their Bacon number. That way I can go on the set and say, 'Good to see you,' or 'Good to see you again.'"" Several other celebrities with tenuous ties to Bacon joined him onstage Saturday, including actress Felicia Day, who noted that ""'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon' is really the idea of social media before there was social media."" The talk closed with fellow panelist Lance Ulanoff, editor of tech site Mashable, shooting a Vine video of Bacon with the audience waving in the background. That way, Bacon said, everyone in attendance in Austin is now just one degree of separation away from him.

"(CNN) -- This World Cup final looked to answer a question that has been surfacing throughout this tournament, and perhaps -- considering the hold King James has had on U.S. basketball fans in the past few weeks -- all of sports: Is it the team, or is it the star? The last game of this tournament pitted the best player in the world, Messi, against the best team in the world, Germany. And if nothing else, this match demonstrated definitively that while players like Messi might win games, teams like Germany win titles. So Messi gets the Golden Ball. Germany gets everything else. After steamrolling its way over Brazil to make the final, Germany looked to be a favorite for the title despite its early draw with Ghana. For Argentina, at stake was the lure of claiming the title on the home turf of its arch rival, Brazil, which finished a devastatingly disappointing fourth after losing in Saturday's match against the Dutch. But the depth of Germany was too much for Argentina in the end. While Thomas Müller -- who started the tournament with a hat trick against Portugal and whose goal against Brazil in the semifinal made him only the second player in history to score five goals in consecutive World Cups -- has been one of the stars of these past weeks, it was an extra-time goal by Mario Götze, who came off the bench, that propelled Germany to the top. So with play over for another four years, what have we learned? Sports matter:  As we have seen time and time again with the Olympic Games, politics do not cease to exist when players step onto the field, the court or the pitch. This tournament proved yet again what a critical window sport provides into the world we live in, particularly considering the fiery protests that greeted the Brazilian government when it signed on the dotted line to host. The billions spent on bringing the most-watched sporting event in the world to Brazil put the country's government into a fragile state as protestors told FIFA to ""GO HOME."" But the politics were not reserved for the streets of São Paulo and Rio: Inside the stadiums we saw fans in blackface when Germany faced Ghana and a spike in the use of ""Nazi"" on Twitter when Germany faced both Brazil and the United States. The World Cup next goes to Russia, with Sochi's Fisht Olympic Stadium one of the venues. If the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympic Games are any indication, one has to wonder if Russia's next role as host to the world will renew cries against the country's discriminatory policies against the LGBT community, its controversial annexation of Crimea and claims last year by Manchester City star Yaya Toure that he had been abused by racist CSKA Moscow fans during a Champions League match. Soccer remains the most popular sport in the world:  To say the World Cup is a global spectacle barely scratches the surface. The television viewing numbers for the group stages broke all sorts of records. While American pundits seemed stunned that 24.7 million people in the United States watched their national team face Portugal, the ratings in other countries during the group stages are almost incomprehensible. Some 47.4 million people watched Brazil face Croatia, while in Japan 34.1 million people watched their team take on Ivory Coast. On Twitter, Germany's smack down of Brazil became the most conversed match ever, with 35.6 million tweets, dwarfing this year's Super Bowl numbers of 24.9 million. It's time for FIFA to get its own head in the game: Sometimes the seemingly simplest sports can be the most dangerous. It is clear that FIFA needs to learn the hard lesson of American football and start paying attention to head injuries. It needs to think about changing its harsh substitution rules, which do not let a player return to the game once he sits and give a coach only three players off the bench per game. In the final, Germany's Christoph Kramer took a nasty shot to the head when he collided with Argentina's Ezequiel Garay in minute 17, but after a moment on the sideline, he went back in for almost 15 more minutes before falling again and leaving the game, looking unquestionably dazed and confused. Kramer's collision was one of many that this tournament saw. Argentina's Javier Mascherano cracked his head in the semifinal against the Dutch and continued to play, while Uruguay's Álvaro Pereira went down unconscious after a knee to the head during his team's first-round match against England. Like the others, he returned to the game after a brief checkup on the sideline and played for the remaining 30 minutes. Rugby is experimenting with new substitution rules for players suspected of having concussions. Calls for soccer to do the same will likely only intensify. Bizarre moments at the World Cup final . The United States maintains its love-hate relationship with soccer: Yes, we know, thousands upon thousands of children hit the pitch every Saturday morning, spring and fall; and yes, we know, Major League Soccer is growing its attendance and cultivating its fan base; and yes, we know, NBC is growing its ratings for the Premier League telecasts. But will this translate to soccer breaking into the ranks that basketball, baseball, football and hockey enjoy? To be sure, more than ever before, American fans got on the World Cup wagon that somewhat shuts the rest of the world down every four years. ESPN saw record-breaking numbers for U.S. games during its excellent coverage of the tournament, and the United States found a legitimate rock star player in Tim Howard, making him a social media sensation after he stopped everything but a bus against Belgium. Importantly, not all U.S. fans stopped watching after the Americans had been eliminated. The Germany-Brazil rollover nabbed some 6 million U.S. viewers on a Tuesday afternoon, making it the largest-rated non-U.S. World Cup game in history. That said, allegations that soccer is boring, ""flopping"" players are ridiculous (that means you, Arjen Robben), the officiating (especially the time keeping) is confounding and that many fans are racist hooligans continue to be sermonized with passion and venom. In the United States, then, there is only one thing we can count on in four years: there will be those who yet again claim that soccer has finally arrived and those who say that it hasn't and never will. But perhaps we can answer the question sooner. Tune in next year, when the Women's World Cup heads to Canada. Because on that pitch, the United States will be a major factor, and there are few things Americans like more than being contenders. Note: An earlier version of this article gave incorrect names for the opposing teams when Thomas Müller scored in the semifinal and when 24.7 million Americans watched.","Is it the star or the team?

"South Korea is perhaps the world's leader in terms of identifying and treating gaming and Internet addiction. After wiring the nation with the world's fastest broadband infrastructure, South Korea's government spends millions per year to identify and treat gaming and Internet addicts. About 8% of the country's population age 9 to 39 suffer from Internet or gaming addiction, according to a 2010 government study. Some see South Korea as a window into the future: Perhaps other nations, including the United States, will see a wave of gaming and Internet addiction when our technological infrastructure catches up. Others say it's too soon to know if gaming addiction is really its own disorder. In the United States, Internet and gaming addiction are not listed in the official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. In the next revision of that list, however, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed that ""Internet Use Disorder"" be listed as warranting further study. Some groups, however, have moved forward with treating Internet and gaming addiction. One of the leaders in that field is Dr. Han Doug-hyun, from Chung-Ang University Hospital in Seoul, South Korea's capital. Han's research lab treats people who are addicted to games using techniques similar to those used to treat alcoholics, including counseling and virtual-reality therapy (Check out this CNN video to see inside his research and treatment space). As part of CNN's feature on ""Gaming Reality,"" Han gave us his list of the top five warning signs that a person should seek professional help for Internet or gaming addiction. Take a look at the tips and let us know what you think of them, and of the science of gaming addiction, in the comments. Here are Han's top 5 warning signs of gaming or Internet addiction: . 1. Disrupted regular life pattern. If a person plays games all night long and sleeps in the daytime, that can be a warning he or she should seek professional help. 2. If the potential gaming or Internet addict loses his or her job, or stops going to school in order to be online or to play a digital game. 3. Need for a bigger fix. Does the gamer have to play for longer and longer periods in order to get the same level of enjoyment from the game? 4. Withdrawal. Some Internet and gaming addicts become irritable or anxious when they disconnect, or when they are forced to do so. 5. Cravings. Some Internet and gaming addicts experience cravings, or the need to play the game or be online when they are away from the digital world.","South Korean psychiatrist gives 5 warning signs of gaming addiction .

"Here's a thought that might make even the most conscientious e-mail user nervous: ""When the CIA director cannot hide his activities online, what hope is there for the rest of us?"" The American Civil Liberties Union posed this question in a recent blog post. The group, of course, was referring to the scandal involving David Petraeus, who resigned as head of the spy agency after the FBI uncovered e-mails indicating he was having an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. The story has gotten lots of media attention, in part for its soap-operatic qualities. Less discussed, however, at least outside the technology press, is what this e-mail-based investigation says about privacy and surveillance in the digital age. Here's a quick look at some of the more surprising issues: . E-mail -- even anonymous e-mail -- is not as secure as you think: E-mails don't just carry a subject line and whatever you type into them. These digital missives also tote along with them packets of information called ""metadata"" or ""headers,"" which may contain information about where the message was sent from. That can help investigators corroborate who sent an e-mail, even if it comes from an anonymous account. ""In the case of Yahoo Mail and Outlook that includes the IP address of the connection used to send an email, so investigators don't need to subpoena a mail provider to trace its origin,"" Tom Simonite writes for the MIT Technology Review. Forbes writer Parmy Olson summarizes the situation this way: ""In these days of constant communication by mobile and desktop, it's almost impossible to leave zero trace of a digital footprint, even if you do send e-mails through an anonymous account."" Communicating by saving e-mail drafts on a joint account is old hat: Some reports indicate Petraeus tried to communicate with his mistress by setting up a joint e-mail account with her and then saving messages in the account's draft folder. So, essentially, they may have been e-mailing each other without actually sending an e-mail. That sounds smart, right? Very James Bond. (Or very al Qaeda.) But the technique has become so dated that it's no longer much of a cover. ""If we know that kind of subterfuge is being used by terrorists,"" writes Patrick Radden Keefe for The New Yorker, ""then it's almost axiomatically an inadequate counter-surveillance option."" The ACLU's Chris Soghoian writes that saving e-mails in draft form instead of sending them may, paradoxically, make it easier for investigators to access the messages. U.S. digital privacy law was written before e-mail was popular: Here's a doozy. The privacy law that governs digital communications was last updated in 1986, or, as the ACLU puts it, when ""there was no World Wide Web, nobody carried a cell phone, and the only 'social networking' two-year-old Mark Zuckerberg (now the CEO of Facebook) was doing was at pre-school or on play dates."" The law, called the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, has some seemingly odd provisions, including one that, according to Wired, allows authorities to access e-mail that's more than 6 months old without a warrant from a judge. All that's needed is a subpoena, which is easier to obtain. ""It's not yet clear on precisely what legal authority the FBI obtained access to Broadwell's e-mail,"" The New Yorker says, ""but under the relevant federal statute, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the government need do little more than ask."" Tech companies want to make it harder for law enforcement to read your e-mail: As Heather Kelly reports for CNN, the tech companies that control most of the digital info stored by Americans these days actually want that law to change. ""Google is an active member of the Digital Due Process Coalition, which has been pushing for reform of the ECPA,"" she writes.

"On Thursday night, ""Glee"" bid farewell to a beloved actor and character. The series ran its tribute episode titled ""The Quarterback"" in honor of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn Hudson on the hit Fox show. Monteith was found dead in his Vancouver hotel room in July. His death was ruled accidental due to ""mixed drug toxicity, involving intravenous heroin use combined with the ingestion of alcohol"" according to the British Columbia Coroners Service. The memorial episode had been eagerly awaited by fans desiring to see how the storyline would be crafted to deal with the loss of one of the show's central characters. Thursday night's show picked up three weeks after the funeral of Finn with no information as to how the character died. Viewers watched as the entire McKinley High School grappled with his loss -- including the character of Finn's love, Rachel Berry, played by Monteith's real-life girlfriend, Lea Michele. ""He was my person,"" Michele's character, Rachel, cried during the show. ""I feel like, for me personally, I've lost two people: Cory and Finn,"" Michele recently told TV Week Australia. ""Everyone is asking, 'Is it hard to do this? Is it hard to be back at work?' But the truth is, it's no harder at work than it is in life — so we might as well all be together as a family supporting each other to get through this together."" The musical show built around a high school glee club included songs like The Pretenders' ""I'll Stand by You,"" ""Seasons of Love"" from ""Rent"" and ""If I Die Young"" by The Band Perry. But a pivotal moment came when Michele's character sang Adele's ""Make You Feel My Love"" with tears streaming down her face. There were plenty of tears from most of the characters as Finn's football jacket appeared to become a symbol for Monteith's presence on the show. Worn by Finn's stepbrother Kurt Hummel (played by Chris Colfer), the posession of it is argued for by Noah Puckerman (played by Mark Salling) and draped over the shoulders of Santana Lopez (played by Naya Rivera) before contributing to one of the most emotional moments of the show. The sadness of the characters and cast extended to the fans. Fox set up a memorial page, #RememberingCory, to curate tweets, vines and Instagrams for viewers to share memories and their feelings watching the very emotional episode. ""I have so many emotions inside of me right now,"" wrote Twitter user  Keeli Faith. ""Lea singing Make You Feel My Love makes me have too much emotion #RememberingCory,"" tweeted fan Emily Fitzpatrick. There were also some lighthearted moments, of course, given that the show is a comedy. At one point  the character of Tina Chang (played by Jenna Ushkowitz) consults guidance counselor Emma (played by Jayma Mays) about the constant state of mourning. ""This look is so Tina two years ago,"" Tina says. ""I spent so much time transitioning away from Goth, and look at me. It's like I'm back in that look."" Emma comforts her with a hug and pamphlets titled ""It's Not All About You,"" ""When to Stop Talking,"" and ""Wait, Am I Callous?"" Monteith was not only a favorite with fans, but also with his cast mates. At the Emmys in September, actress Jane Lynch, who plays Coach Sue Sylvester on the show, paid tribute to Monteith during a special segment on the awards show. ""Cory was a beautiful soul,"" Lynch said. ""He was not perfect, which many of us here tonight can relate to. His death is a tragic reminder of the rapacious, senseless destruction that's brought on by addiction.""","""Glee"" says goodbye to Cory Monteith and his character on Thursday .

"Calls mounted Thursday for a criminal investigation into sometimes fatal delays in care at Veterans Affairs hospitals amid revelations that patient wait times were tied to employee bonuses in at least one hospital. The demands by lawmakers and veterans groups come as President Barack Obama appears to be asking Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to set the stage for his own departure, perhaps as soon as Friday. Obama is waiting for an internal audit he ordered from Shinseki on the growing scandal before deciding whom to hold accountable, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Shinseki's preliminary report is due this week, Carney told reporters amid more calls from across the political spectrum for the secretary to step down or be dismissed over problems known for years but apparently never addressed. Carney stopped short of saying Obama is standing by the embattled secretary, pointing instead to the President's recent statement that Shinseki would likely not be interested in continuing to serve if he believed he let veterans down. But that was not enough for a number of lawmakers in Congress after Wednesday's release of a preliminary VA inspector general's report that described a ""systemic"" practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Phoenix. The VA inspector general reported that at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment or were placed on a waiting list at the Phoenix VA, raising the question of just how many more may have been ""forgotten or lost"" in the system. Rep. Steve Israel of New York, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is among those taking the outrage one step further, calling for a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice. ""I want to know if anybody at the VA doctored papers, engaged in a cover up, withheld care from veterans,"" he told CNN, adding the demand in the form of a letter was hand delivered Thursday to Attorney General Eric Holder's office. ""They need to be investigated They need to be prosecuted. They need to be fired."" Republican Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, made a similar demand of the Justice Department. ""I think the facts are too many now for them to look the other way,"" he said. The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing the VA inspector general's report but has not formally opened an investigation, Peter Carr, an agency spokesman, has told CNN. The VA is under fire over allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases. CNN has reported that in Phoenix, the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. The VA's troubled history . The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. The VA's acting inspector general, Richard Griffin, told a Senate committee in recent weeks that his investigation so far had found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in Phoenix. But he added that there was no evidence excessive waiting was the reason. Among the findings at the Phoenix VA, investigators determined that one consequence of manipulating appointments for the veterans was understating patient wait times, a factor considered in VA employee bonuses and raises, the report said. Miller believes the actions may be in part about money for ""VA bureaucrats."" ""Why else would somebody work so hard to manipulate the lists?"" Miller said. The issue of patient wait times is not an overall performance factor ordered by the VA, Dr. Thomas Lynch, the VA's assistant deputy undersecretary for clinical operations, told Miller's committee. The factors tied to bonuses and raises are decided by each VA network, Lynch said. The VA inspector general's report did not offer any further details about financial incentives. Carney repeated Thursday that Obama found the report deeply troubling, and a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity told CNN that Shinseki was on ""thin ice"" with the President. Shinseki finds himself in a firestorm . In an opinion piece published Thursday in USA Today, Shinseki wrote that he found the report ""reprehensible"" and that he's ""not waiting to set things straight."" ""I immediately directed the Veterans Health Administration ... to contact each of the 1,700 veterans in Phoenix waiting for primary care appointments in order to bring them the care they need and deserve,"" Shinseki wrote. Shinseki reiterated other steps he's taken, including putting the leadership at the Phoenix facility on leave May 1 and ordering a ""nationwide audit of all other major VA health care facilities to ensure understanding of, and compliance with, our appointment policy."" ""We are doing all we can to accelerate access to care throughout our system and in communities where veterans reside,"" Shinseki wrote. ""I've challenged our leadership to ensure we are doing everything possible to schedule veterans for their appointments. We, at the Department of Veterans Affairs, are redoubling our efforts, with commitment and compassion, to restore integrity to our processes to earn veterans' trust."" Even so, it wasn't enough for an increasing number of Washington politicians who called for Shinseki to go. A number of Democratic senators -- many of them facing rough re-election battles later this year -- have joined a growing bipartisan chorus urging the secretary to resign or the President to fire him. ""The inspector general's preliminary report makes it clear that the systemic problems at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are so entrenched that they require new leadership to be fixed,"" said Mark Udall of Colorado, the first Senate Democrat to call for a change at the top. List of senators calling for Shinseki resignation . Still, others question whether removing Shinseki would address the core problems at the VA or simply serve as a distraction for now. ""Is him resigning going to get us to the bottom of the problem? Is it going to help us find out what's really going on?,"" asked House Speaker John Boehner, the chamber's top Republican, adding that his answer so far was ""no."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi also warned against targeting only Shinseki, telling reporters that ""we have to be careful about thinking that just because you remove the top person, means that you've changed the systemic problem that existed in the organization 10 years before Shinseki, or five years at least before Shinseki became the secretary."" Pelosi also joined the push for a criminal investigation of the VA problems, saying ""certainly what was done was dishonest."" VA pledges faster appointments .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have a suspect in custody in connection with a backpack bomb found in January along a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade route in Spokane, Washington, according to Michael Ormsby, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Washington. Kevin William Harpham, 36, of Colville, Washington, was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and possession of an unregistered explosive device, Ormsby said. Harpham appeared before a federal magistrate Wednesday and was ordered held without bail after Harpham waived his detention hearing, Ormsby said. Federal public defenders were appointed to represent him, and they will be able to ask for a bail hearing at a later date, Ormsby told CNN. Harpham lived alone in a mobile home or modified mobile home on a 10-acre tract in rural Stevens County, and the closest large city is Colville, Washington, Ormsby said. Federal prosecutors will seek a grand jury indictment against Harpham on March 22, Ormsby said. An arraignment for Harpham is scheduled for March 23, added Ormsby. On Wednesday, authorities were conducting a search of Harpham's home, Ormsby said. The weapon of mass destruction charge would carry a maximum penalty of life in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to five years of court supervision after release, prosecutors said. The unregistered explosive device charge would carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release, they said. The suspect was apprehended away from his home, a law enforcement source told CNN. Authorities are trying to determine if the bomb attempt was part of a conspiracy, but for now, the scheme seems to be a ""lone wolf"" situation, the source said. In January, the FBI said it would consider recent local neo-Nazi activity in its investigation of the backpack bomb. But this week, authorities still have not publicly linked the bombing attempt to any specific group or organization, Ormsby said. The bureau has been looking into the incident as ""an act of domestic terrorism,"" Frank Harrill, special agent in charge of the FBI's Spokane field office, said in January. The investigation was aided by detailed forensic and follow-up work on the backpack bomb itself, the law enforcement source said. After the bomb was discovered, it was sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, authorities said at the time. The bomb was found the morning of the parade in January by three workers before the event began, authorities said. The FBI released photos of the Swiss Army-brand backpack and two T-shirts found in it. One shirt says ""Treasure Island 2009"" and the other reads ""Stevens County Relay For Life June 25th-26th 2010."" On Wednesday, Washington  Gov. Chris Gregoire credited the three workers and law officers, saying when the Spokane's emergency response system was put to a test, ""it worked as it should have and prevented what could have been a terrible tragedy on a day of celebration."" ""I again want to commend the three workers who reported the suspicious backpack to authorities, and the law enforcement officers who responded,"" Gregoire said in a statement. Also on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder expressed gratitude no one was injured in the bombing attempt. ""I can say that it was a viable device. It was planted with the aim of injuring or killing people. And we were fortunate that it did not go off and people were not killed. We were just lucky in that regard,"" Holder said. The device contained a chemical found in rat poison and was packed with little metal pellets, apparently as shrapnel, another law enforcement official told CNN in late January. The device was set up to be detonated remotely, that official said. The two neo-Nazi activities the FBI referred to in January occurred in nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho -- one on the King holiday and another three days earlier. Coeur d'Alene is 35 miles east of Spokane. Three days before the holiday, a handful of neo-Nazis in Coeur d'Alene protested two Mexican restaurants with signs saying, ""This is white land"" and ""We want you out of here."" During the evening of the holiday, about 15 neo-Nazis demonstrated outside the Human Rights Education Institute in downtown Coeur d'Alene. The Coeur d'Alene area had been a hotbed of neo-Nazi activity through the Aryan Nations and Order II hate groups since at least the 1970s, though the groups were disbanded through criminal convictions and civil lawsuits by 2000, said Tony Stewart, one of the founders of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations in Coeur d'Alene. CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","NEW: Kevin Harpham, 36, who lived alone in a rural mobile home, is ordered held without bail .

"Records of dead veterans were changed or physically altered, some even in recent weeks, to hide how many people died while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA hospital, a whistle-blower told CNN in stunning revelations that point to a new coverup in the ongoing VA scandal. ""Deceased"" notes on files were removed to make statistics look better, so veterans would not be counted as having died while waiting for care, Pauline DeWenter said. DeWenter should know. DeWenter is the actual scheduling clerk at the Phoenix VA who said for the better part of a year she was ordered by supervisors to manage and handle the so-called ""secret waiting list,"" where veterans' names of those seeking medical care were often placed, sometimes left for months with no care at all. For these reasons, DeWenter is among the most important and central people to the Phoenix VA scandal over a secret wait list, veterans' wait times and deaths. Despite being in the center of the storm, DeWenter has never spoken publicly about any of it -- the secret list, the altering of records, the dozens of veterans she believes have died waiting for care -- until now. Records changed . It was one of DeWenter's roles to call veterans when appointments became available to schedule them to get a consultation. Sometimes when she made those calls, she'd find that the veteran had died, so she would enter that on their records. But at least seven times since last October, records that showed that veterans died while waiting for care -- records which DeWenter personally handled and had entered in details of veterans' deaths  -- were physically altered, or written over, by someone else, DeWenter said in an exclusive interview with CNN. The changes, or re-writes, listed the veterans as living, not deceased, essentially hiding their deaths. The alterations had even occurred in recent weeks, she said, in a deliberate attempt to try to hide just how many veterans died while waiting for care, by trying to pretend dead veterans remain alive. ""Because by doing that, that placed (the veterans) back on the wait list,"" said DeWenter, explaining she believes that the purpose of ""bringing them back to life"" in the paperwork and putting the veterans back on the electronic waiting list was to hide the fact that veterans died waiting for care. ""I would say (it was done to) hide the fact. Because it is marked a death.  And that death needs to be reported.  So if you change that to, 'entered in error' or, my personal favorite, 'no longer necessary,' that makes the death go away.  So the death would never be reported then."" 'Into a desk drawer' Beginning early last year, DeWenter said she was also instructed to hide the crisis at the Phoenix VA medical center by concealing new requests for treatment. This was at a time when the VA was paying bonuses to senior staff whose facilities met the goals of providing care in a timely manner for veterans, typically within 14 days. New requests by veterans wanting treatment were actually stuffed into a drawer, to make the books look better, according to DeWenter. Asked what happened to the new requests for appointments, DeWenter said: ""They went into a desk drawer.... That would be the secret list."" There was ""no doubt"" it was, in fact, a secret list, she said. DeWenter's claims support those of Dr. Sam Foote, now retired from the VA, who spoke to CNN in March and raised the lid on the Phoenix crisis and allegations that up to 40 veterans died while waiting for care. Since November 2013 CNN has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across VA hospitals around the country. Massive investigation . The concerns over delays in care and deaths of veterans across the country created a national furor during the last six weeks that prompted Senate hearings and ultimately led to the resignation of President Obama's VA Secretary, Eric Shinseki. Investigators from the VA's Inspector General's office have been in Phoenix looking into the charges by DeWenter, Foote and other VA whistle-blowers. The teams include criminal investigators. The VA's Office of Inspector General also has investigators in 69 other locations, looking into charges of other data manipulation, delays and deaths, and allegations of whistle-blower retaliation. Report: Veterans neglected for years in VA facility . DeWenter said she has ""submitted evidence"" to criminal investigators about the altering of records and also the secret list and how it worked. Officials at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs did not respond specifically to any of DeWenter's allegations. Instead a spokesman sent CNN a generic statement stating: . ""As Acting Secretary Gibson has said at VA facilities around the country, we must work together to fix the unacceptable, systemic problems in accessing VA healthcare.  We know that in many communities, including Phoenix, veterans wait too long for the care they've earned and deserve.  That's why VA is taking action to accelerate access to care and reaching out to veterans to get them off wait lists and into clinics.  "" The statement added: ""We respect the independent review and recommendations of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) regarding systemic issues with patient scheduling and access, and we await the OIG's final review."" 'Beyond horrible' It has been an horrific year for DeWenter. In early 2013, the waiting list at the Phoenix VA was so long that 1,700 veterans were on it, and many vets could not get an appointment for as much as nine months, or longer, DeWenter said. On average there were requests from 40 new patients a day, she said. DeWenter says the hospital administration knew it, but was so focused on meeting an immediate goal, the patients didn't matter. ""It's beyond horrible,"" she said, tearing up at times during the interview. DeWenter said in addition to keeping the secret list and keeping quiet when she learned veterans on the list died, she was also pushed to clear up the backlog on the electronic waiting list, which put pressure on follow-up care as well. There simply were not enough doctors -- and not enough appointments -- to handle new patients, backlogged patients and even very sick patients. DeWenter, a scheduling clerk, was suddenly making life and death decisions. Doctors, nurses and emergency room providers were calling her trying to get appointments for individual patients who couldn't wait. ""And that really overtook even the wait list,"" DeWenter said. ""Because now I have a consult where veterans are very sick.  So I have to ease up on the wait list.  It sounds so wrong to say, but I tried to work these scheduled appointments so at least I felt the sickest of the sick were being treated."" Congressional action on VA: Too little, too late . The stress, DeWenter said, was unbearable. Then came the call she had to make in early December. She finally had an appointment available for a Navy veteran who had come to the VA months earlier urinating blood. ""I called the family.  And that's when I found out that he was dead,"" she said. Turning point . DeWenter would not tell CNN the patient's name. But CNN interviewed Sally and Teddy Barnes-Breen earlier this year, and the stories match. Thomas Breen, Teddy's father and a Navy veteran, died in November 2013 after being repeatedly denied care at the Phoenix VA. DeWenter called the home and reached Sally Barnes-Breen, telling her the VA finally had a primary appointment for her father-in-law. Barnes-Breen told CNN she was incensed, as Breen had just passed away.  ""I said, 'Really, you're a little too late, sweetheart,'"" she told CNN previously. DeWenter said that conversation was a turning point -- hearing the anger from the family and details on how the veteran died screaming that veterans did not deserve such treatment. ""And I promised her that I would do everything in my power to never have this happen to another veteran again,"" she said. Going public . DeWenter said that's when she and Foote began seriously talking about what could be done. In December of last year DeWenter and Foote told everything to the VA's Office of the Inspector General. ""I thought that was a saving grace,"" DeWenter said. ""I thought, 'Okay, this is it.  This is gonna be all over,' you know?  Then it wasn't.  And we were waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  And nothing ever happened... Nothing.  We didn't hear anything.  The leadership (in Phoenix) was telling us, 'Oh, we passed everything.  We're not doing anything wrong.'  And I'm like, 'We're not doing anything wrong? But people are still dying?'"" DeWenter said they were giving up hope and decided for Foote to contact the media. DeWenter said until now she was simply too scared to come forward. And she is still scared. ""My life will change after this comes out. I will have people at work who are not going to like me because of what I've done. And I'll have other people at work who will say thank you for doing what you've done."" DeWenter believes her information on what she says is an ongoing coverup at the Phoenix VA is in the hands of the FBI. Performance reviews at troubled VA showed no bad senior managers .

"(CNN) -- Twitter is set to launch an analytics service, it it was reported this week, allowing users to track the popularity of their tweets, their own popularity on the service, and the number of retweets, replies and faves each tweet received. In short: Twitter is launching a powerful tool that will make marketers salivate. What's more, it's being reported that the product may start at a surprising price: Free. Is Twitter simply throwing money away? Tracking social media is big business, and the news that Twitter is set to enter the ring with a free product of its own may strike fear in the hearts of market leaders. ""Social media monitoring"" services charge anything from tens of dollars to tens of thousands of dollars per month to provide brands with insights about their social marketing efforts. The popular product Radian6, for instance, has prices starting at $600 per month. What's more, brands large and small willingly pay these rates, keen to understand what their customers are saying about them on social media sites -- and perhaps influence those conversations. But few businesses are aware such services exist. Twitter would have the advantage of putting its analytics product directly in front of its 175 million users. With prices ranging from $10 per month for the individual user to thousands of dollars per month for corporate customers, such a service would easily be worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year. So why wouldn't Twitter jump at this opportunity? One obvious reason: Businesses are more likely to stick with Twitter if they're able to measure and improve upon the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. To continually update a Twitter feed requires significant effort, and without any evidence that the activity is improving the bottom line, it's hard to make the business case for maintaining a Twitter account. With detailed statistics made available to every user, however, the story is very different -- a free analytics product would improve the company's poor user retention rates. There's another reason to make a social analytics product freely available: Facebook already does. Facebook Insights, which provides in-depth data to Facebook page owners, allows news organizations, brands and small businesses to optimize their Facebook usage to achieve their business goals. Given the choice between paying for Twitter stats or using Facebook Insights for free, perhaps some businesses would choose Facebook as their social platform of choice. Customer service concerns may also have swayed Twitter's thinking. When using a free product, customers have low expectations about the level of personal service they expect to receive. But once those same customers are paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a product, there's a need for a much larger customer service team. Or perhaps Twitter just wants to get people hooked. While the company is rumored to be launching the product as a free service, there's no reason Twitter couldn't charge for extra features in the future. Offering a free service to get customers in the door (the so-called ""freemium"" model) could help the company attract more paying customers at a later date. So will a free analytics product mean Twitter is throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars per year? Not necessarily: In the long term, a starting price of free may make better business sense for the social media giant.","Twitter is launching an analytics service that lets users track the popularity of their tweets .

"When Pieter Franken visited Hong Kong one of the first things he did was measure the level of radiation in his hotel room. A Geiger counter is not usually packed by a business traveller, but well as having a banking industry day job Franken is part of a Tokyo-based citizen action group set up to map the radiation levels of cities across the world. Called Safecast, the group was founded as a response to the dearth of accurate, comprehensive data on the radioactive fall-out from Fukushima's stricken nuclear reactors. Read more about Japan's recovery from the Fukushima nuclear disaster . ""The whole idea is to measure everything (rather than only performing spot checks),"" said Franken. Hong Kong lies just 50 kilometers from a nuclear power station located in Daya Bay in Guangdong province, but its 12 permanent radiation monitoring stations are not in heavily populated urban areas. On a six-hour drive around the city's major commercial and residential, Franken mapped radiation levels with a portable monitoring kit devised by Safecast.  All the data is publicly viewable as interactive heat maps on Safecast's website. The drive revealed that Hong Kong had a constant level of radiation that hovered around 0.2 microsievert per hour for an annualized dose of 2 millisieverts.  This was slightly higher than the 0.1 microsievert per hour that Safecast mapped in the major urban centres of Tokyo and Beijing. One millisievert per year is an internationally-recognized nuclear factory guideline for exposure to radiation by the general public, according to Dr. John Leung, radiation expert and physics professor at the University of Hong Kong. ""Your risk of having cancer is increased for 4 to 5% per sievert of radiation your body absorbs,"" explained Leung.  ""The way to control it is to receive as little as possible."" On his drive around Hong Kong Franken wanted to see how localized the radiation was, ""but it seems to be all over,"" he said.  ""In Tokyo, you will come across hotspots, sudden spikes in readings, but here you don't have that kind of concentrated source."" More on Rebuilding Japan . Much of the radiation we are exposed to everyday is naturally-occurring—produced by the sun, soil, water and rock.  The World Health Organization estimates that on average, people are exposed to 2.4 millisieverts per year from natural background radiation. However this natural background radiation did not explain the uniformity of Safecast's Hong Kong findings or the spikes in radioactivity in tunnels. It led Franken to believe that the common denominator throughout the city, concrete, was a key source of the radiation. Or more specifically, the locally-sourced granite aggregates used in place of pricier cement to make the concrete. ""Hong Kong is lying on a high-background radiation level because the radionuclide content in the granite in this region of the country is a bit higher than the world average,"" said Leung.  ""There is more uranium and thorium in our granite.  It's natural."" A study conducted by Leung and his colleagues in 1990 found that the gamma radiation dose rate of local soil to be 1.8 times the world average. Hong Kong's concrete infrastructure poses no immediate harm to residents' health, but some wonder if more attention should be given to how buildings are made in the city. ""When we make concrete, we don't pay attention to the mineral content of the rock, so long as it is strong enough,"" said University of Hong Kong structural engineering professor, Albert Kwan.  ""If it's really is the case (that local granite has elevated radioactivity), perhaps we should import our granite from elsewhere."" The everyday doses of radiation we encounter are far from being fatal in one shot, but it is the accumulated exposure that may be cause for concern. According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), there is no direct evidence of ill effects on human health up to an accumulated dose of 10 millisieverts.  For comparison, a typical dose from a one-hour flight is 0.003 millisieverts per hour, while a 10-second chest X-ray would expose you to 0.05 millisieverts. An accumulated exposure of 10 to 1000 millisieverts may result in an ""increased incidence of certain types of cancer, years to decades later...The incidence of cancer in a population increases with the radiation dose received,"" according to UNSCEAR. In 2006, the World Health Organization estimated that up to 4,000 cancer deaths would occur among over 500,000 clean-up workers, evacuees, and residents remaining in highly-contaminated areas near Chernobyl, many of whom were exposed to doses exceeding 100 millisieverts. To reduce everyday levels of radiation Safecast suggests opening doors and windows to ventilate rooms. This minimizes the accumulation of radon - a radioactive gas produced by the decay of naturally occurring uranium and thorium. Inhaling radon - one of the leading sources of human exposure to natural radiation - in the home and workplace causes tens of thousands of deaths from lung cancer annually, according to the World Health Organization.

"They're often called ""ambush"" killings. Recent slayings of lawmen -- a Colorado prison chief, a Texas prosecutor, a West Virginia sheriff and a California cop -- conjure up comparisons to the deadly surprises and have contributed to a disturbing increase this year in law officer killings nationwide, analysts say. ""When somebody says 'ambush,' you see a character in a movie and you expect a guy to trip over a line or somebody pop up from a garbage can or somebody has the high ground and shoots on them,"" said Steve Weiss, research director for the Officer Down Memorial Page, whose website tracks slain U.S. law officers. The Colorado, Texas, California and West Virginia deaths ""are kind of like that movie-style ambush,"" Weiss said. It's what many officers fear most, said CNN contributor Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. ""Rookie officers are taught generally you're not concerned about the bullet with your name on it, but about those addressed 'To Whom It May Concern,'"" Fuentes said, referring to random ambush shootings against police. While an ambush often refers to an assailant lying in wait, the FBI statistics include ""unprovoked attacks"" without hiding, which one analyst likened to the circumstances in the Texas and California slayings. The FBI counted 15 officer deaths by ambush in each year of 2011, 2010 and 2009, and said that ambush situations were the biggest category of circumstance behind 543 officers feloniously killed between 2002 to 2011: 23.2%. The next highest category was an arrest situation, at 22.5%, according to FBI statistics. Associate of suspected Colorado killer arrested . Weiss' group doesn't specifically count ambush deaths of officers, but a search of its records with the word ""ambush"" shows that 14 law officers died in such a manner in the past 12 months -- a figure almost matching the FBI's recent data trends. The group says that as of Friday, the total number of law enforcement fatalities is up 29% over the same period last year, and the number of gunfire-related fatalities of law officers is up 36%, Weiss said. There have been 31 officer fatalities in 2013, and 15 of them are gunfire deaths, Weiss said. The killings in the four states have contributed to that increase, Weiss said. His group, however, doesn't include the two prosecutors' deaths in its counting. Colorado prison chief Tom Clements was fatally shot at his home this month after he answered the door bell. Questions haunt prisons chief slaying case . The Kaufman County, Texas, district attorney and his wife were shot to death in their home last month; his assistant D.A. was fatally gunned down in the parking lot of the county courthouse after a very short confrontation in January. And rogue ex-Los Angeles Police Department officer Christopher Dorner threatened to kill police randomly and in fact shot five officers, killing two earlier this year. A Riverside police officer was fatally shot after Dorner drove up to his vehicle at a stoplight and fired. A San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy was shot by Dorner while responding to a report of a vehicle stolen by someone matching Dorner's description. The sheriff of Mingo County, West Virginia, was killed this week after a gunman walked up to the sheriff as he sat in his vehicle in a parking lot near the county courthouse. The gunman shot the sheriff in the head and then returned to his vehicle and drove away. The FBI defines ambush killings into two types. One is by ""entrapment and premeditation,"" which is a scenario ""where the officer was lured into danger as the result of conscious consideration and planning. These attacks are generally accomplished from cover or hiding; however, they can occur without cover or hiding,"" the agency said. There are also ambushes of ""unprovoked attacks,"" which are ""generally accomplished without hiding; however, they can occur with or without cover,' the FBI said. Weiss, however, questioned the FBI definition. From the viewpoint of police, what's considered a routine traffic stop can turn deadly when a motorist suddenly pulls a gun and shoots the officer. ""Unless you're responding to a scene where someone is shooting, pretty much anything is an ambush,"" Weiss said. ""There's countless number of times where an officer stops a car for a traffic violation and then they are shot."" But Weiss acknowledged the ambush circumstances in California, Colorado and Texas, and noted how the Colorado killing evoked America's frontier era of the 1800s when local sheriffs were vulnerable to home attacks. ""When the public thinks of ambush, it's when someone calls 911 and there's somebody waiting on a rooftop. That's unusual,"" Weiss said. ""They type of incidents in Texas and with the Colorado prison director is even more unusual. ""When somebody shows up at someone's home, those are really unusual. In these days, you very rarely see that,"" Weiss said. ""Our town is a little more civilized than back in the 1800s."" The recent yearly trend of 15 ambush deaths of officers is haunting, Weiss said. ""Any number above the number zero is high,"" Weiss said. ""That is a high number. To make that decision ever is hard to fathom, but to plan it out in a premeditated matter is troubling."" But the overall yearly number of killed officers nationwide is much lower than the 1970s -- an era when violence on police was remarkably high, according to Weiss and Fuentes. There were 120 officers killed in 2012, 176 each in 2011 and 2010, and 140 in 2009, Weiss said. Those figures compare with 249 in 1971, 232 in 1972, 273 in 1973, and 279 in 1974, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page website. Fuentes recalled the 1970s as an era where public respect toward police was low. ""With the Dirty Harry and Charles Bronson and 'Death Wish' movies, it was fair game to shoot cops on the street and there was generally a lack of respect for uniformed officers,"" Fuentes said. ""But over the years, the respect has returned and been earned. ""When respect goes up, the attacks go down,"" he added.","Ambush killings against law officers have occurred in California, Colorado, Texas, West Virginia .

"(CNN) -- With the latest reports of fake lists of dead veterans and alleged electronic coverups still going on at Phoenix Veterans Administration hospital, it's clear the disaster that has become the VA is just getting worse. So now more than ever, we have a duty to call on our leaders to right the wrongs we have found and prevent more from taking place. Our veterans, who survived hand grenades and bullets, are now facing a growing threat from three-ring binders and manila folders -- and a VA culture reluctant to measure, too slow to adapt and not responsive to their needs. To truly fix this problem, we must follow where the evidence takes us. For thousands of veterans in this country -- and those returning home from more than a decade at war -- the stakes could not be higher. The true cost of an antiquated system, slow technological upgrades, and the inability to track performance of the system itself can now be measured in thousands waiting far too long for care, and perhaps the tragic deaths of our brave heroes who may have waited too long for care. The next leader of the VA has a lengthy to-do list. After all, Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation did not reduce any backlogs or streamline the complex bureaucracy that exists and has harmed our veterans. And virtually all of those responsible for setting up and maintaining the culture of deception that has produced this scandal still have jobs. Until we can accurately measure and use information to evaluate what works and what doesn't -- and then address the problems our veterans face -- the rooms piled full of files and paperwork are not going anywhere, and veterans will continue to be neglected. The VA has had challenges under both Democratic and Republican administrations -- and if ever there was a bipartisan problem in need of bipartisan solutions, this is it. Here's where we should start: . 1. Improve the systems: We must continue to modernize the VA system through technology and data-driven approaches that demand results and make evaluation possible. The transition to electronic medical records is good, but not enough. 2. Collect and evaluate data: The backlog, and outdated and inaccurate tracking systems, fogged our ability to realize the scope of the problem and provide the care veterans deserve. The VA has an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and change their culture to one that tracks results and is responsive to the data they collect. American veterans deserve a system that meets the standard of excellence they set through their service. Collecting data from not only the investigations, but into the future as well will enable the VA to evaluate what is working and what needs more attention, funding or repair. 3. Meet the needs of veterans through smart deployment of resources: As a former chairman of the House Budget Committee and director of the Office of Management and Budget, I can safely say that throwing money at a problem hasn't and doesn't fix it -- and neither does blindly cutting funding. I am glad the VA was spared from sequestration cuts, as the VA has, despite funding increases, a classic problem of supply and demand. They have a lack of sufficient doctors and health care workers to meet the growing needs of all veterans, including aging vets and those returning from two protracted wars. The VA must now ask: What does the evidence in other health care systems tell us about how to efficiently meet the needs of veterans, while strengthening the quality of care and VA health system itself? Funding boosts for an antiquated system alone won't help, but looking at what works in other health delivery systems, as well successful public and market strategies will. 4. Establish strong leadership and bipartisan buy-in: A lengthy and political Senate confirmation process for Secretary Shinseki's replacement will do nothing for our veterans. What the VA needs now is strong leadership and bipartisan support for the next secretary which will give that individual a mandate to change the culture and fix the broken systems. 5. Listen to the customers: In business, there is no substitute for listening to the customers. The same goes for our nation's veterans. A nationally representative survey of veterans accessing the VA health care system should be conducted immediately to fully understand the depth and breadth of the problems they have faced beyond long waiting periods for their appointments. It will also give the new VA leadership some informative data. Together, we must get the facts, follow the evidence, listen to the veterans themselves, and we should use this as an opportunity for evidence-based, transformational change. We made a promise to our military members and their families. It is our duty to keep it.

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- The Missouri woman whose Twitter account publicized supposedly confidential information about the grand jury proceedings in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown says she didn't send the tweet and her account was ""probably hacked."" Prosecutors in St. Louis County are investigating a Twitter post claiming the grand jury hearing evidence in the Ferguson shooting hasn't heard enough to warrant charging Officer Darren Wilson in the death of the unarmed teenager. ""The matter has been referred to the prosecuting attorney for investigation,"" said a statement from the St. Louis County court administrator. ""The court will hear the matter and take appropriate action, if the prosecutor finds cause to believe misconduct has occurred."" The woman, who CNN is not identifying, said in an interview with reporters on the doorstep of her home that she hadn't used her Twitter account in months and thought she had deleted it. Complete coverage of Brown shooting and protests . ""I didn't care for it because I just don't get the whole Twitter thing,"" she said, adding that someone had hacked her account and posted spam in the past. She further said that she knew no one on the grand jury hearing Wilson's case and told CNN she had left a voicemail for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch about the tweet. She hasn't heard back from his office, she said. ""It had to have been hacked,"" she said of her account. ""I promise you I did not do any of this."" The Washington Post first reported Wednesday that ""an account of possible jury misconduct surfaced ... on Twitter when several users sent messages about one juror who may have discussed evidence in the case with a friend."" In one post, someone said they knew a member of the grand jury and ""there isn't enough at this point to warrant an arrest."" Activist Shaun King provided information on the Twitter user, the prosecutor's office told The Post. Investigation is complete . The developments came on the same day the prosecutor's office said the investigation into the controversial shooting death in the St. Louis suburb has been completed. Wilson shot and killed the 18-year-old in the middle of the day on August 9 after telling Brown and a friend to get out of a street. Authorities could have charged Wilson by filing a criminal complaint, but McCulloch instead opted to present the case to a grand jury to decide whether to indict the officer. Ferguson mayor: Our eyes opened to racial problems . ""The investigation has been basically completed that is being conducted by both the FBI and St. Louis County PD,"" Ed Magee, the spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told CNN. A grand jury is expected to decide by mid-November whether Wilson will be charged criminally for the shooting, which sparked weeks of unrest on the streets of Ferguson and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. The white police officer's shooting of the black teenager was heavily debated throughout the nation. The grand jury, which began meeting in August, is expected to consider whether a crime was committed and if ""probable cause"" exists that Wilson committed that crime. It was uncertain how the misconduct investigation might affect the case. If misconduct is found, the process may have to start over, The Post reported. Some witnesses have said Brown assaulted the officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun. Others said Wilson was the aggressor. A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Last month, two contractors doing construction work in Ferguson on the day Brown was killed said the teenager had his hands up in the air as he was gunned down. The men, who asked not to be identified after CNN contacted them, said they were about 50 feet away from Wilson when he opened fire. A video captured their reactions during the moments just after the shooting. ""He had his f***in' hands up,"" one of the men said in the video. The men said they didn't see how the confrontation started. Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting . Feds scrutinizing shooting, Police Department . Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations: one into Brown's killing and the other into the Ferguson Police Department's record with minorities. One investigation will review the shooting by Wilson, a 28-year-old officer with six years of experience, including four in Ferguson. A civil rights violation would require that Wilson had shown ""racial hostility"" against Brown in the shooting, legal analysts have said. The U.S. Justice Department also announced a second inquiry to examine accusations that the Police Department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy-handed tactics. The shooting ignited angry protests and instances of looting on the streets of Ferguson. Community leaders criticized what they said was an excessive show of force by police to the demonstrations. Local officials have failed to soothe public outrage. Last week, even after apologizing for his department's actions after the shooting, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson insisted that he's not stepping down. ""This is mine,"" he told CNN. ""I'm taking ownership of it."" Jackson said he's heard the calls for his ouster, but that doesn't mean he'll answer them. ""I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,"" he said. ""Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through."" An apology, with continued unrest . The Brown shooting stirred complaints of widespread racial profiling in Ferguson, which Jackson has rejected. ""It's never been the intention of the Ferguson Police Department -- or any police department that I know -- to intentionally target individuals because of race,"" the chief said. ""If there is that happening, it's a crime and it needs to be addressed."" Jackson released a video apology to Brown's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to Ferguson's streets to protest the young man's death. In that video, the chief expressed regret that it took investigating officers four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead. The St. Louis suburb of 21,000 erupted again last week after one of three Brown memorials at the site of the shooting burned. While many peaceful protesters took to the streets on September 23, violent elements within the demonstration stoked chaos, attacking police with gunfire, rocks and bottles, and vandalizing and looting businesses, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. One person threw a Molotov cocktail at a parking structure, and there was an attempt to set a gasoline fire at a custard shop, he said. Two officers were injured, one of whom was struck by a rock below the eye, Johnson said. The City Council has recently taken up measures to reform court procedures and the way the city handles certain fines. The council is also considering a citizen review board to monitor the Police Department. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Missouri woman says she did not send tweet about grand jury proceedings .

"Jerad Miller filled his Facebook profile with anti-government rants and warned he was about to make a sacrifice. Amanda Miller posted cute photos about cats -- and a picture of a coffee table built to hide rifles. Now authorities are poring over the couple's social media posts as they investigate the pair's deadly weekend shooting rampage that left two police officers and a civilian dead. Witnesses said the husband and wife shouted about revolution and left a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a Nazi swastika behind at the scene of Sunday's shooting. Then Amanda Miller shot her husband dead and killed herself as police closed in, authorities said. Investigators said they're looking at the Millers' social media footprint, interviewing acquaintances and looking at a note pinned to one of the victims as they work to unravel what might have led the pair to ambush police eating lunch at a pizza restaurant, then gun down a shopper at a Walmart across the street. One possible reason? ""They equate government and law enforcement ... with Nazis,"" Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Monday. ""In other words, they believe that law enforcement is the oppressor."" 'Dawn of a new day' On June 7, a day before the shooting, a Facebook post from Jerad Miller suggested something was brewing: ""The dawn of a new day. May all of our coming sacrifices be worth it."" ""People are awakening,"" said a post that appeared June 5. On June 2, there was a long rant: ""We can hope for peace. We must, however, prepare for war. We face an enemy that is not only well funded, but who believe they fight for freedom and justice. Those of us who know the truth and dare speak it, know that the enemy we face are indeed our brothers. ..."" ""To stop this oppression, I fear, can ... only be accomplished with bloodshed,"" the post says. The writer casts blame on ""enemies,"" but doesn't specify who the enemies are. Other posts on the page decry the federal government, gun restrictions and taxation. In face-to-face conversations, it was common to hear Jerad Miller railing against the government, neighbor Kelly Fielder said. ""He was pretty much always talking about how much the government's changed the United States of America,"" she said. ""I thought he was talking smack. To my eyes, they were generally good people at the time. I didn't think they had the guts to go out and really hurt someone."" Court records describe Jerad Miller's past run-ins with the law, including drug charges. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to a felony criminal recklessness charge and was sentenced to a diversion program. In 2011, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge of dealing marijuana and was sentenced to two year's probation and drug counseling. He was arrested and charged with battery in 2009. A jury acquitted him later that year. Couple moved to Las Vegas in January . The Millers moved from Indiana to Las Vegas in January, according to Amanda Miller's Facebook page. She posted two videos of them driving: one that showed the road ahead and another of her at the wheel. Her Facebook profile also shows pictures of a protest last year in Lafayette, Indiana. The ""Million Mask March"" protest's Facebook page describes the November 2013 event as ""a march against billionaires who own banks and corporations who corrupt politicians who enslave the people and injustice."" Another picture on her Facebook page in late April shows her and Jerad in costume: He is dressed as the Joker from ""Batman"" holding up a Joker playing card. The 31-year-old mimics the character's trademark menacing grin. His 22-year-old wife is pressed beside him, her leg hiked sexily up. She's apparently dressed as Harley Quinn, another ""Batman"" character. In another post on her Facebook page: A photograph of what's described as a cross-stitched female Joker holding a gun aloft. The couple liked to dress up as the cartoon villains, neighbor Krista Koch told CNN affiliate KTNV. Koch also told the CNN affiliate that Jerad Miller occasionally dressed as Slenderman, a fictional horror character that recently became widely known after two 12-year-old girls were accused of stabbing another 12-year-old girl in Wisconsin. Police said one of the girls told investigators they acted to please Slenderman. Koch said the Millers told her they were planning an attack. But she discounted them, believing, she said, that they were ""crazy."" Neighbor: 'He said the revolution's begun' Fielder said she saw the couple, who had been living with her for a couple weeks before the shooting, leave with weapons early Sunday morning. ""He said the revolution's begun. I gotta do what I gotta do,"" she told CNN. Amanda Miller hugged her, and said ""when I die, I'll come back and see you again."" The husband and wife were carrying guns and ammunition, she said. ""They said they were going underground,"" Fielder said. ""They were using it for protection."" The neighbor, who described Amanda Miller as her best friend, said she didn't think they'd take things so far, but now wishes she'd spoken out sooner. ""I got five deaths on my shoulders,"" she said. ""I should have called the cops. ... I'm so, so, so sorry, to everyone."" Connection to Cliven Bundy? Neighbors at the Las Vegas apartment complex where the couple lived told The Las Vegas Sun they had heard the Millers talk about their support of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy. One neighbor said Jerad Miller had talked about being at the April armed standoff between Bundy and federal authorities, who began to round up the rancher's cattle after he refused to vacate federally owned land. Hundreds of people, many toting weapons, joined Bundy during the standoff. Bundy said Monday that he was aware of reports that Jerad Miller was part of the movement that supported him, but said he wasn't aware of Miller. ""Probably 4,000 people came by, and I knew few of them personally,"" he told CNN's Dan Simon. His son, Ammon Bundy, said that ""state militia members"" told him the Millers had been at the ranch, but were asked by a militia member to leave because of ""their radical beliefs."" ""They didn't align with the reason the protesters were there at the Bundy ranch,"" he said. Based on their social media profiles and what investigators have revealed so far, there are no signs the couple was part of a particular group, said  Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center who studies hate groups and extremism. But they did seem to support the so-called Patriot movement, which decries the federal government and what supporters call the ""New World Order."" The couple's support of Bundy, Potok said, could be key. For many in the Patriot movement, he said, the standoff at Bundy's ranch was a major victory. ""Tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands or more saw what happened at the Bundy ranch as a huge victory against the federal government and perhaps an opening shot at the war that they all wished for and waited for with the government,"" Potok told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""I think it's entirely possible that the Millers, in fact, saw the Bundy standoff as very important, and it may have pushed them over the edge."" A local news crew interview surfaced online Monday, showing Jerad Miller talking about the standoff at the ranch. ""I feel sorry for any federal agents that want to come in here and try to push us around or anything like that,"" he told NBC at the time. ""I really don't want violence toward them, but if they're going to come bring violence to us, well, if that's the language they want to speak, we'll learn it.""","Neighbor: Leaving home before shooting, Jerad Miller said, ""The revolution's begun""

"(CNN) -- Tea Party activist Mark Williams says he's done discussing the controversy stirred up by his attack on the NAACP, accusing a fellow movement leader of turning the debate into ""a World Wrestling style personality conflict."" The National Tea Party Federation, an organization that seeks to represent the Tea Party political movement around the country, has expelled Williams and his Tea Party Express organization because of the inflammatory blog post Williams wrote last week, federation spokesman David Webb said Sunday. In response, Williams announced in another statement on his blog that, ""I am refusing all media requests on this"" and canceled a scheduled interview on CNN to discuss the controversy Sunday evening, citing a last-minute change in travel plans. ""That careless individual tea partier who assumed the mantel of 'leadership' did so long enough to turn a critical and serious movement and delicate peace with skeptical groups into a World Wrestling style personality conflict with me at the center,"" Williams said. ""There are internal political dramas amongst the various self-anointed tea party 'leaders,' and some of the minor players on the fringes see the Tea Party Express and Mark Williams as tickets to a booking on ""Fact [sic] the Nation.' "" Webb appeared on the CBS program Sunday morning to announce that Williams and the Tea Party Express -- which has held a series of events across the country to generate support for the movement -- no longer were part of the National Tea Party Federation. ""We, in the last 24 hours, have expelled Tea Party Express and Mark Williams from the National Tea Party Federation because of the letter that he wrote,"" Webb said of Williams' blog post that satirized a fictional letter from what he called ""Colored People"" to President Abraham Lincoln. NAACP President Ben Jealous met Williams' statement by telling CNN, ""Good riddance, Mark Williams."" But he praised Tea Party activists like Webb, who is African-American, for standing up and ""self-policing"" their movement. ""As the movement grows up, you have to act responsibly and they have to keep doing what they just did to Mark Williams and make it clear there is no space for bigots here, period,"" Jealous said. Williams wrote the incendiary blog post in response to an NAACP resolution that called on Tea Party leaders to crack down on racist elements in the movement. The 101-year-old civil rights group cited signs carried at Tea Party events and racial slurs reportedly shouted at black members of Congress during the heated debate over health care as examples of racism in the movement. ""Dear Mr. Lincoln,"" began the fictional letter posted by Williams. ""We Coloreds have taken a vote and decided that we don't cotton to that whole emancipation thing. Freedom means having to work for real, think for ourselves, and take consequences along with the rewards. That is just far too much to ask of us Colored People and we demand that it stop!"" Williams went on to write that the Tea Party movement couldn't be racist because it opposed government bailouts for Wall Street banks and big corporations. ""Bailouts are just big money welfare and isn't that what we want all Coloreds to strive for?"" the posting said. ""What kind of racist would want to end big money welfare? What they need to do is start handing the bailouts directly to us coloreds!"" Williams, a conservative talk radio host, said the post was intended as satire. He took it down as criticism mounted. Some political leaders interviewed on Sunday talk shows also said the Tea Party movement itself wasn't racist, but needed to distance itself from any elements that bring prejudice and bigotry to its events. ""There are some members who have used the Tea Party -- whether it's the Tea Party itself, there are some individuals who have tried to exacerbate racial tensions in this country,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I have seen some virulent fliers that have been directed at our members, clearly referencing race, the president's race and race generally."" On the same show, however, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, steered clear of the issue, saying: ""I am not interested in getting into that debate.""","Williams says Tea Party controversy is ""a World Wrestling style personality conflict""

"(CNN) -- An estimated 95 percent of Louisiana's 2 million coastal residents had fled ahead of Hurricane Gustav by Sunday evening in the largest evacuation in state history, Louisiana's governor said. The streets of the French Quarter in New Orleans clear out as residents evacuate in anticipation of Hurricane Gustav. More than 200,000 people have left New Orleans, leaving an estimated 10,000 people in the city Sunday night, Gov. Bobby Jindal said, citing New Orleans' police chief. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin had demanded an evacuation of the city, which still is recovering from 2005's Hurricane Katrina. Forecasters warned Gustav -- a Category 3 storm Sunday night -- could hit Louisiana with devastating effect late Monday morning or early Monday afternoon. Jindal said New Orleans' levees should ""barely hold or barely be overtopped"" if the storm, as predicted Sunday evening, hit southwest of the city. But even a slight shift to the east could bring ""very significant flooding in these areas,"" he said. iReport.com: Leaving home? Share your story . On Sunday night, road, rail and air links out of New Orleans began to close ahead of Gustav, which was sweeping toward the Gulf Coast with 115-mph winds. At 8 p.m. ET, Gustav was about 260 miles south-southeast of New Orleans, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, reported. The storm was moving across the central Gulf of Mexico at 17 mph. Hurricane-force winds could hit Louisiana's southern coast by sunrise Monday, and the storm's center could hit southwest of New Orleans by early Monday afternoon, CNN meteorologists said.  Watch residents leaving » . Dangerous storm surges of 10 to 14 feet above normal tides are expected near and to the east of Gustav's center, forecasters said. Rain accumulations between 6 to 12 inches are possible over parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas, with isolated amounts of up to 20 inches, through Wednesday morning, according to forecasters. Gustav killed at least 51 people in southwestern Haiti and eight in the neighboring Dominican Republic last week before moving to Cuba. It was in the Caribbean on Friday and intensified just before it hit Cuba. In New Orleans, Lt. Col. Jerry Sneed, the city's emergency operations chief, said government agencies had evacuated 18,000 residents who were without transportation. National Guard troops and police were still combing the city late Sunday afternoon, broadcasting evacuation messages in English, Vietnamese and Spanish, Jindal said. Jindal said the New Orleans area had finished evacuating homebound and nursing home patients by 7 p.m. ET Sunday, and 73 critical-care patients deemed OK to move still were in the process of being moved out of the area.Some critical-care patients had to stay at medical facilities. Eighty patients remained Sunday evening at New Orleans Children's Hospital, more than half of them in a critical care unit. Nurse Crystal Mayeaux says she will not leave them. ""We are attached to all the babies here, she says. ""They know us.""The last flights out of the city's airport were slated to take off Sunday evening, and highways out of town were packed all day with evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi. ""It was bumper-to-bumper for about 10 hours trying to get out,"" said Roberto Ascencio, a restaurant owner in the New Orleans suburb of Gretna. He said he, his wife and daughter packed their pets and whatever else would fit in their car and headed east on Interstate 10 as Gustav neared. Nagin said New Orleans would  impose a ""dusk-to-dawn"" curfew for anyone left.  Watch Nagin voice concern about storm's potential effect on the city » . The city-wide curfew will continue until the threat of the storm passes, Nagin said, warning looters would be dealt with harshly.  Watch Nagin warn would-be looters » . ""Anybody who's caught looting in the city of New Orleans will go directly to Angola [Louisiana State Penitentiary]. You will not have a temporary stay in the city. You go directly to the big house, in general population,"" he said. The storm altered plans for the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to run from Monday through Thursday in St. Paul, Minnesota. Rick Davis, campaign manager for presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain, said Monday's session would run only from 3 to 5:30 p.m. CT, and will include only activities that are necessary to launch the event. ""Owing to the fact that [McCain] has asked us to take our Republican hats off and put our American hats on, tomorrow's program will be business only, and we'll refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention,"" Davis said. Convention plans for the rest of the week will be made as the storm is assessed, he said. Earlier Sunday, President Bush said he would forgo an appearance at the convention on Monday to go to Texas to meet with emergency workers and evacuees. He urged Gulf Coast residents to get out of the storm's path. ""This storm is dangerous,"" Bush warned after a briefing at FEMA headquarters, urging residents to heed calls to evacuate. Also Sunday, a federally supported computer projection says Gustav could cause up to $29.3 billion in property damage when it hits the Gulf Coast. The software, developed by FEMA and the National Institute of Building Sciences, also projected Sunday that 4.5 million people will be in the storm's path and 59,953 buildings will be destroyed. The path also ensnares about 170 hospitals and more than 1,100 police and fire stations. State, local and federal officials urged residents across the region to flee. Charter flights, paid for with federal funds, carried thousands of evacuees to other Southern cities, including Knoxville, Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee. The air evacuation was part of a detailed plan developed in response to criticism after Katrina's chaos. Katrina, a Category 3 storm, flooded most of New Orleans, flattened beach towns in Mississippi and killed more than 1,800 people. Maps of Gustav's path show that it could strike southern Louisiana and other areas battered by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said government agencies were ""10 times better prepared"" than before -- but ""that doesn't mean everything is going to go right,"" he said. ""Anybody who thinks everything is going to go perfect just doesn't know what they're talking about,"" Barbour said.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds dead. Many more infected. Pervasive fear and denial are challenging authorities in west Africa who are trying to assess and address the Ebola crisis. So far, it has killed more than 650 people, says Doctors Without Borders. That's the highest death toll the World Health Organization has recorded in an Ebola outbreak. And it's getting worse. The swelling numbers prompted heads of state to cancel travel plans on Thursday to direct their full attention toward fighting the outbreak of the virus that has crippled parts of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and stirred palpable concerns that it will spread around the region and the world. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma both canceled trips to the United States, and Koroma declared a state of emergency. He announced a action plan that addressed many of the barriers international medical workers complain they face while fighting disease. Some residents in affected villages have accused them of bringing the disease into the country and have barricaded their towns or otherwise blocked access to Ebola hemorrhagic fever victims. A nurse with Doctors Without Borders, Monia Sayah, told CNN, ""the most challenging"" aspect of trying to help people is that ""we go into communities where we are not necessarily welcome,"" because people don't want to believe they or their loved ones have Ebola -- in part because ""they understand now that the survival rate is not very high."" Koroma said he will deploy police and military to accompany the aid workers. They will search house to house for the infirm and enforce orders designed to curb the virus' spread. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? Aid groups pull out . ""The matter has reached a crisis point,"" Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown told CNN's Richard Quest. ""...The dire prognosis is that it will get worse before it gets better."" The dangers are so real that some humanitarian organizations are pulling out to protect their own. Samaritan's Purse -- an international evangelical Christian humanitarian agency -- and the missionary group Serving in Mission have recalled all nonessential personnel from Liberia. The Peace Corps announced Wednesday it is doing the same, removing its 340 volunteers from that country, as well as Sierra Leone and Guinea. While there are no confirmed cases, a spokeswoman for the agency did say that two volunteers did come in contact with someone who ended up dying from the virus. Those Americans haven't shown signs of Ebola but are being isolated just in case, with the spokeswoman saying they can't return home until they get medical clearance to do so. American dies . One American, 40-year-old Patrick Sawyer, died in a Nigerian hospital earlier this month -- having come from Liberia, where he was a top Ministry of Finance official, and before he could go back home to Minnesota to celebrate his daughters' birthdays. But the vast majority of those afflicted are Africans. They come from big cities and small villages, some of them falling ill without really knowing what hit them. ""This epidemic is without precedent,"" said Bart Janssens, director of operations for Doctors Without Borders, a group also known as MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res. ""It's absolutely not under control, and the situation keeps worsening."" As of now, the outbreak has been confined to west Africa. But there are rising concerns that it could spread, especially since a person may not know they have Ebola or show symptoms for two to 21 days after being infected. Sawyer, for example, collapsed getting off a plane in Lagos, Nigeria. He very well could have made it out of the region, perhaps to the United States, before showing symptoms of Ebola; it's only then that the virus spreads. To further complicate matters, signs of Ebola include fever, headaches, weakness and vomiting -- symptoms that also define many other ailments, from malaria to the flu that Brown notes often pop up ""at this time of year."" For all these reasons and more, Janssens says, ""If the situation does not improve fairly quickly, there is a real risk for new countries to be affected."" Could outbreak spread to U.S.? 2 infected Americans . Ebola spreads through the transmission of bodily fluids. Those most at risk are loved ones of those infected, as well as health care workers tending to the ill. Sawyer is believed to have been infected by his ailing sister, who he spent time with in Liberia -- even though neither likely knew she had Ebola -- according to Brown. Then there are those like Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, who fell ill early last week while overseeing Ebola treatment at a Sierra Leone hospital and died days later. Two Americans affiliated with Samaritan's Purse who also were infected ""have shown a slight improvement in the past 24 hours"" though both are in serious condition, according to the Christian humanitarian agency. One of them is Dr. Kent Brantly, a 33-year-old who last lived in Fort Worth, Texas. He has been the medical director for the Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia, Liberia, where he has been providing care for Ebola patients since October. After testing positive for the virus, Brantly went into treatment at ELWA Hospital. The other is Charlotte, North Carolina, resident Nancy Writebol, a Serving in Mission member working with Samaritan's Purse to help fight the Ebola outbreak. Ebola fears hit close to home . It is believed one of the local staff was infected with Ebola and came to work with the virus on July 21 and 22, Samaritan's Purse Vice President Ken Isaacs said. That staff member died Thursday. ""We think it was in the scrub-down area where the disease was passed to both Nancy and Kent,"" he said. Brown, the Liberian information minister, noted Brantly and Writebol's fight in his CNN interview, as well as Liberia's need for more health care workers like them. ""We join the families in prayers that they can come through this and become ... shining examples that, if care is taken, one can come out of this."" Liberian president: 'Ebola kills' On Monday, the CDC issued an alert warning travelers to avoid hospitals with Ebola patients and funerals for those patients in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak. The United States is considering raising the alert to discourage ""nonessential"" travel to those three countries, a spokesman said. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has told the Ministry of Health to consider quarantines in some areas and cremating bodies in an attempt to prevent further infection, according to Brown. The president also urged residents to avoid public amusement and entertainment areas, and set aside Friday ""for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities."" ""My fellow Liberians, Ebola is real. Ebola is contagious. And Ebola kills,"" Sirleaf said. ""All of us must all take extra measures announced by the Ministry of Health to keep ourselves safe. ""The government will do its part. But you must do yours."" CNN's Jonathan Helman, Elise Labott, Pamela Brown and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","Ebola hemorrhagic fever has killed more than 660, aid organization says .

"A second American aid worker in Liberia has tested positive for Ebola, according to the Christian humanitarian group she works for. Nancy Writebol is employed by Serving in Mission, or SIM, in Liberia and was helping the joint SIM/Samaritan's Purse team that is treating Ebola patients in Monrovia, according to a Samaritan's Purse statement. Writebol, who serves as SIM's personnel coordinator, has been living in Monrovia with her husband, David, according to SIM's website.  The Charlotte, North Carolina, residents have been in Liberia since August 2013, according to the blog Writebols2Liberia. They have two adult children. On Saturday, Samaritan's Purse announced that American doctor Kent Brantly had become infected. The 33-year-old former Indianapolis resident had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia and started feeling ill, spokeswoman Melissa Strickland said. Once he started noticing the symptoms last week, Brantly isolated himself. Brantly, the medical director for Samaritan Purse's Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia, has been in the country since October, Strickland said. ""When the Ebola outbreak hit, he took on responsibilities with our Ebola direct clinical treatment response, but he was serving in a missionary hospital in Liberia prior to his work with Ebola patients,"" she said. Deadliest Ebola outbreak . Health officials say the Ebola outbreak, centered in West Africa, is the deadliest ever. As of July 20, some 1,093 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are thought to have been infected by Ebola since its symptoms were first observed four months ago, according to the World Health Organization. Testing confirmed the Ebola virus in 786 of those cases; 442 of those people died. Of the 1,093 confirmed, probable and suspected cases, 660 people have died. There also are fears the virus could spread to Africa's most populous country, Nigeria. Last week, a Liberian man hospitalized with Ebola in Lagos died, Nigerian Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said. Lagos, the largest city in Nigeria, has a population of more than 20 million. The man arrived at Lagos airport on July 20 and was isolated in a local hospital after showing symptoms associated with the virus. He told officials he had no direct contact with anyone with the virus nor had he attended the burial of anyone who died of Ebola. Another doctor infected . Confirmation of the death in Lagos came after news that a doctor who has played a key role in fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone is infected with the disease, according to that country's Ministry of Health. Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan is being treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -- also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, agency spokesman Tim Shenk said. Before falling ill, Khan had been overseeing Ebola treatment and isolation units at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of the capital, Freetown. Ebola typically kills 90% of those infected, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60% because of early treatment. What is Ebola, and why does it kill? Spread by bodily fluids . Officials believe the Ebola outbreak has taken such a strong hold in West Africa because of the proximity of the jungle -- where the virus originated -- to Conakry, Guinea, which has a population of 2 million. Because symptoms don't immediately appear, the virus can easily spread as people travel around the region. Once infected with the virus, many people die in an average of 10 days as the blood fails to clot and hemorrhaging occurs. The disease isn't contagious until symptoms appear. Symptoms include fever, headache and fatigue. At that point, the Ebola virus is spread via bodily fluids. Get the fast facts on Ebola . Health workers are at especially high risk, because they are in close contact with infected people and their bodily fluids. Adding to the danger, doctors may mistake the initial stages of an Ebola infection for another, milder illness. Deadliest outbreak ever: What you need to know .

"A Turkish court ruled Wednesday that the country's ban on Twitter violates the right to free expression and demanded that citizens' access to the popular microblogging service be restored. Three people filed complaints to the Constitutional Court after the Telecommunications Directorate blocked access to the social media website Twitter. The court sent its decision to the Telecommunications Directorate and the Transportation, Maritime and Communication Ministry, asking that necessary measures to restore the service be taken. Speaking to the daily newspaper Hurriyet, Metin Feyzioglu, president of the Union of Turkish Bar Associations, said, ""If they don't abide by the ruling, we will file a criminal complaint against the (Telecommunications Directorate) by attaching the ruling of the Constitutional Court."" A lower court overturned the Twitter ban last week, but access to the service has not been restored. Blaming social media for fueling anti-government rhetoric, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to ""eradicate"" Twitter at a campaign rally in Bursa on March 20. Within hours, Turkish Internet users were reporting widespread disruptions to Twitter. Outrage ensued as the hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #DictatorErdogan began trending worldwide. Freedom of expression campaign group Index on Censorship said the ban, which it called ""censorship of which the worst authoritarian regimes would be proud"" was ""emblematic of the increasingly authoritarian tendencies"" of Erdogan.

"South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is one of the GOP's brightest stars, a 42-year-old Indian-American, a dynamo fundraiser and a favorite of national Republicans eager to showcase diversity in their ranks. Haley's road to re-election this November has looked smooth of late, thanks to Obamacare's unpopularity in South Carolina, a shrinking unemployment rate and the cautious approach of her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Vincent Sheheen. But Haley's path to victory might have just become more complicated. That's because a little-known attorney and former judge named Tom Ervin has joined the race for governor as an independent -- and his campaign is threatening to raise at least $6 million in the process. ""We're going to spend whatever it takes,"" Ervin told CNN. ""I am going to tell the truth to the people of South Carolina."" Ervin entered the race clumsily. In March, he filed to run against Haley in the Republican primary, loaning his campaign $420,000 as seed money. He promptly unleashed $65,000 worth of robocalls attacking the governor. But he soon dropped out of the primary and announced his independent bid, saying there wasn't enough to time to mount a credible GOP campaign before the June 10 primary. Haley's campaign was quick to diminish Ervin as a ""liberal trial lawyer."" ""We appreciate Mr. Ervin's desire for public service, but a trial lawyer and former Democratic lawmaker‎ who wants to raise taxes and embrace Obamacare should probably be running as a Democrat,"" said Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey. ""Governor Haley is focused on the legislative session, passing historic education and ethics reforms and keeping the fantastic economic and jobs momentum going. And we look forward to running against two liberal trial lawyers who support Obamacare instead of just one."" Rumors of a shadow campaign . Ervin's audacious, last-minute entry into the race has been met with eye-rolls by Republicans. A popular rumor in Columbia is that his candidacy is little more than a shadow campaign aided by trial attorneys who have long clashed with the pro-business governor and want a spoiler in the race. Haley defeated Sheheen by just four points when they first squared off in the 2010 race. Some Democrats are hopeful that Ervin, and his money, will help them open up a two-front war against Haley on the campaign trail, while siphoning Republican-leaning voters away from the incumbent. A libertarian candidate, Charleston businessman Steve French, could do the same. Others, though, are concerned that Ervin will hurt rather than help their cause by divvying up the existing anti-Haley vote, thereby hurting Sheheen, who needs to grow his support in a GOP-dominated state. ""I think it could hurt,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in the state. ""There are a lot of moderate Democrats, a lot of people who would have voted for Vincent who may gravitate to Tom Ervin now if he throws a punch. It may Balkanize the anti-Haley vote. That may be in play now."" Adding intrigue to Ervin's candidacy is the behind-the-curtain presence of Republican consultant John Weaver, the mercurial former John McCain and Jon Huntsman strategist who is consulting on the campaign. Weaver, a screwdriver-sipping Texan who tweets prolifically about the San Antonio Spurs, has never been shy about sticking his finger in the eye of his fellow Republicans. After McCain lost his bid for the presidency in 2000, Weaver briefly dabbled in Democratic politics and feuded with Karl Rove during the Bush years. During the Huntsman campaign, he called Republicans ""a bunch of cranks"" in the pages of Esquire. Ervin's campaign is not the first time he's worked against the GOP on a governor's race: In 2010, he advised the ill-fated candidacy of Tim Cahill, a Democrat-turned-independent candidate for Massachusetts governor. 'A breath of fresh air' ""I was honored when Tom called me three weeks ago about being a member of his team,"" Weaver said in an email. ""We tried to recruit him twice for Sen. McCain in our two primaries in South Carolina -- and failed. I know Tom to be a social and economic conservative and also extremely straight forward and bold in his vision for the state. He'll be a breath of fresh air for sure as the next Republican governor."" Ervin revealed his first ad on Monday, calling himself ""an independent Republican"" and criticizing Haley on a number of issues, including the massive 2012 data breach at the South Carolina Department of Revenue that exposed nearly 4 million Social Security numbers. Ervin's chances of winning the race are slim. There's no modern precedent for a candidate without party support winning statewide in South Carolina. He first has to qualify to get on the November ballot by collecting at least 10,000 signatures needed to run as a ""petition"" candidate. Meanwhile, Haley's campaign has raised nearly $6 million for her campaign, a hefty sum in a state where television ad time is relatively affordable, and she has been aided by a series of commercials paid for by the Republican Governors Association. In one hard-edged ad that began airing this week, the RGA blasts Sheheen, an attorney and state senator, for legal work defending a sex offender and domestic abusers. The South Carolina Democratic Party called the ad ""desperate."" Ervin sees an opening. Sitting for an interview inside the wood-paneled lobby of WRIX, an Anderson radio station he purchased out of bankruptcy last year, the soft-spoken Ervin said his decision to drop out of the Republican primary will give him time to raise money and get his message out. Had he remained in the GOP race, it would have allowed Haley to line her war chest by going back to her donors and soliciting even more money for the primary campaign. Questioning Haley's commitment . Ervin served one term in the South Carolina legislature 30 years ago as a Democrat, and ran for a seat again in 2005 as a Republican, but lost. A practicing attorney involved with charitable work in the Greenville area, he said he has been active in local politics for years. He said he did not vote in the last gubernatorial election. ""We have no leadership in Columbia right now,"" Ervin said. ""Governor Haley has been a disaster. Every agency she has touched is in crisis mode. She is clearly focused on her own selfish political ambitions. If she is re-elected, I seriously doubt she will finish out her term. She has got her eyes on Washington. All she can talk about is federal issues, when our state is languishing."" Ervin pointed to the state's ""crumbling"" roads and bridges, education policy and government transparency as issues he plans to highlight. He said a gas tax is ""on the table,"" and he'd likely sign a budget increasing fees if it passed the state legislature, but his positions hew closer to conservative orthodoxy. Ervin wants to eliminate the personal income tax and says he opposes the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, although he previously told The State newspaper  he would not veto Medicaid expansion if the state balanced the budget. As a born-again Christian, he's against same-sex marriage and abortion. But mainly, he said he wants to make the race a referendum on Haley's first term. Ervin applied a lighter touch to Sheheen, calling him a ""career politician"" and ""far to the left."" But he also described the Democrat as a ""policy wonk"" with ""a good understanding of the issues."" Sheheen's campaign had no comment on Ervin. Ervin's sudden appearance on the political scene, his blistering criticisms of Haley and his ties to the state's legal community -- his wife is a prominent worker's compensation attorney -- have fueled talk in the state capital that he was recruited into the race by Republican fundraiser John Rainey, a longtime Haley nemesis. A remarkable moment . Rainey fiercely opposed Haley during her first gubernatorial campaign in 2010. After she won, he memorably filed a lawsuit and then an ethics complaint against the governor, claiming she profited from her office while serving in the state legislature. That complaint was dismissed, but not before Haley defended herself before the state's ethics panel and, in a remarkable moment, called Rainey ""a racist, sexist bigot who has tried everything in his power to hurt me and my family."" Ervin acknowledged being friendly with Rainey's brother, but denied that he is a stalking horse for the legal community. ""Since I was a circuit court judge for 14 years, I do know a number of attorneys,"" he said. ""And there will be some of my friends that will contribute to my campaign. But I don't expect to get the endorsement of the trial lawyers."" ""I don't know John well enough to approach him,"" Ervin said of Rainey. ""I may, because he wants some change in state government as well. He may be motivated to give. But John has not contributed to my campaign."" Rainey, too, denied any connection to Ervin's campaign. ""No,"" he said flatly when asked if he recruited Ervin to run. ""There is nothing else to say."" Still, Rainey had harsh words for Haley, calling her ""corrupt to the core of her being."" In the next breath, he gamed out a scenario in which Ervin could open the door to a Sheheen victory. ""I think he appeals to centrist Republicans, some of whom don't want to vote for somebody with a D by their name, but who would vote for someone with Republican credentials,"" Rainey said. ""If you can get somebody who can carve off 5% of the vote, Vincent can win. There is no question he can win."" Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina GOP chairman, said Ervin and his wife ""have been very successful in the legal business."" But, he added, ""I don't take it very seriously."" ""They are not going to shake a lot of votes loose from Republicans,"" Dawson said. ""If they are going to spend a couple million, that's their choice. He can do what he wants with his money. If I was Tom and I was looking for some excitement, I wouldn't run as an independent for governor in a Republican state. He'd be better off if he bought a new sports car and got a girlfriend and got it out of his system.""","Tom Ervin was running as a Republican but withdrew and entered as an independent .

"(CNN) -- More people have walked on the moon than have won the fabled Triple Crown of U.S. horse racing. But the scores could soon be level. The last lunar landing was in 1972, and it is 36 years since teenager Steve Cauthen became just the 11th jockey to complete the triumvirate of American Classics, on board Affirmed. On Saturday, California Chrome will attempt put his name in the record books at the Belmont Stakes amid a ""will he, won't he"" debate that's gripped the U.S. in recent weeks. ""There's the time factor, so many big races in so little time,"" the horse's jockey Victor Espinoza told CNN. ""Very few horses go in all three races and there are a lot of good horses in the field on Saturday that will be fresher. That's why it's so, so tough."" It might be a tough ask, but California Chrome is the evens favorite for victory in front of an expected crowd of 100,000 people over a mile and a half, seeking to add to his victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The Triple Crown races take place over the space of just five weeks in an era when thoroughbreds tend to run no more than once a month. After his Preakness success, California Chrome became front page news after New York racing officials decided to allow the three-year-old to wear a breathing strip at Belmont Park. His owners might not have allowed him to race without a strip, which the manufacturer says allows horses to breathe more freely and reduces the risk of bleeding in the lungs during heavy exertion. California Chrome has worn the strips during his last six wins. ""We've grown to train horses to run less frequently,"" says Dr. Larry Bramlage, a leading equine vet in the U.S. who will also cover the Belmont Stakes as a television pundit. ""It's not so much these three races in five weeks but the series of races. You need a certain number of points to qualify for the Kentucky Derby, so that means it's a sequence of six or seven races for California Chrome. ""It's like Olympic athletes -- you can't peak all season, though it's doable."" History supports Bramlage's argument. Five horses have had the opportunity to complete the treble in the past 12 years, and all have come up short. Mexican jockey Espinoza, who is unbeaten on board California Chrome, was one of those five. In 2002, he was riding War Emblem only for his mount to stumble out of the stalls, virtually unseating Espinoza and effectively eradicating his race chances before the Belmont Stakes -- known as ""the test of a champion"" -- had barely begun. ""Things have to be perfect or very nearly perfect for it to happen,"" says Espinoza, who this week has pitched at the Yankees Stadium, rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange and appeared on the David Letterman Show as the interest California Chrome's feats has spiraled. ""There are so many things against you. It's a different distance to the previous two races -- a mile and a half -- but he's run that, and it's a different surface."" Like in the Derby and the Preakness, the surface is dirt but Belmont Park is known as ""The Big Sandy"" -- a nod to its sandier terrain, necessitated by the region's combination of greater rainfall and higher humidity. But the distance and surface are not the only obstacles in the way of the trifecta wannabe. The dangers in the field lie with: Tonalist, winner of the Peter Pan Stakes -- effectively the Belmont trial; Preakness runner-up Ride on Curlin; and Commanding Curve, apparently refreshed after his last race, finishing second in the Kentucky Derby. ""I spoke to a vet that takes care of California Chrome and he said he couldn't have a better personality for what he's trying to do,"" says Bramlage. ""He's just like a kid at a carnival. Physically he's in great shape. If he does his best performance, I don't think there's a horse that can go with him in the race. ""I feel good about it. I think he'll do it."" Espinoza can vividly remember his first triple attempt in 2002, the buildup -- ""which was no way as crazy as this time"" -- and the butterflies in his stomach as he entered the stalls. ""For me, 2002 is still a tough one,"" he says. ""I never thought I'd get a second chance and I'm very lucky to get one. ""He slipped and it was so sharp my reaction was just to avoid hitting the ground. Right then, the chance was gone and the race was only just beginning. ""But that's the Triple Crown. Over three races so many different things can happen. That was unlucky and you need luck."" The 11th of 12 children, Espinoza had an occasionally tumultuous upbringing, moving to the sprawling, often unsafe metropolis of Mexico City when he was eight. ""We had fun as children but Mexico City was crazy and dangerous,"" he recalls. ""I know that every day somebody got shot, people that I know as well. ""But nothing ever happened to my family. Maybe we were just very lucky. I don't know."" California Chrome has gripped American hearts, effectively bought and bred for $10,000 by two owner novices, trained by a septuagenarian and ridden by a jockey who thought his best days had gone. ""California Chrome has a great chance -- he's improved a lot with each race,"" says Espinoza. ""War Emblem had to run from the front -- that was his way. But this one's different -- he wins from everywhere."" At the Kentucky Derby, Espinoza chose to slot him into third position, only moving into the lead on the final turn before pulling out a five-length victory. At the earlier Santa Anita Derby, he found himself boxed in by two horses but broke clear once again for the win. One factor against Espinoza in 2002, and again this year, is his record at Belmont. He has won just two of his 69 races there. ""That's because most rides there are for me trying out other horses with the focus on one big race,"" the 42-year-old says. ""I don't care if I lose every race as long as I win this one.""","California Chrome is bidding to become the first horse in 36 years to win the Triple Crown .

"The U.S. Capitol was briefly evacuated Saturday afternoon when a small aircraft entered restricted airspace, authorities said. The evacuation was ordered after authorities were unable to immediately contact the pilot, U.S. Capitol Police said. NORAD says two F-16 fighter jets intercepted the plane around 1:30 p.m. after it entered restricted airspace and was out of communication with air traffic control. The jets escorted the plane to the airport in Mount Airy, North Carolina, where the pilot was met by members of law enforcement. A U.S. official told CNN that the pilot's destination was Mount Airy, where he was going to meet his daughter.  The source says the pilot said his outdated maps caused him some confusion. There was one other person in plane. No security issues, just a pilot deviation, Ross Feinstein, the Press Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration, tweeted. Staff and visitors were allowed back inside the Capitol after about a half hour. Also evacuated during the scare was the Library of Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court buildings, the Metropolitan Police said. Federal Aviation Administration officials told CNN there will be an investigation into why the pilot entered the restricted airspace without authorization. The incident prompted authorities to institute an AIRCON RED -- air condition red -- alert, police told CNN. The alert is triggered when an aircraft enters restricted airspace in Washington without authorization. Visitors to Washington got unexpected excitement. ""We were touring around in one of the rooms in the Capitol,"" said Victoria Chandler. ""And the tour guide all of a sudden got very frantic and started telling us to evacuate the building and go down the steps. ""I grabbed two of the youngest girls and my mother got me and we started running down the stairs. We got outside and a man told us to run as far as we could because it was not a drill."" Richard Chapin was also in the Capitol. ""We just got in there, like I said, we were excited to see it,"" he said. ""Now we've got a story to tell. We were evacuated out of the Capitol building."" It's not the first time such an alert has been issued. The Capitol was briefly cleared and the White House was temporarily locked down when a single-engine plane wandered into restricted airspace in April 2009. It was also evacuated in January 2011 when a commercial airliner accidentally entered restricted airspace. Authorities: Georgia courthouse attacker prepared to inflict mayhem .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Monday spared I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby from prison, commuting the former White House aide's 30-month prison term. A conviction remains on Scooter Libby's record, and he must still pay a $250,000 fine. The prison time was imposed after a federal court convicted Libby of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a CIA operative. A commutation is distinct from a pardon, which is a complete eradication of a conviction record and makes it the same as if the person has never been convicted. Bush has only commuted Libby's prison term, which means that the conviction remains on Libby's record and he must still pay a $250,000 fine. He will be on probation for two years. Commutations are rarely granted, says CNN's chief legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin. A commutation is a total right of the president and it cannot be challenged by any attorney or court, he said. It's the fourth time Bush has issued one. Earlier Monday, a federal appeals court unanimously ruled that Libby could not delay serving his sentence, which would have put Libby just weeks away from surrendering to a prison. In a written statement commuting the prison sentence, issued hours after Monday's ruling, Bush called the sentence ""excessive,"" and suggested that Libby will pay a big enough price for his conviction.  Watch what signal critics say Bush's decision sends » . ""The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting,"" he said. The president, who has been under great pressure to pardon Libby, said Libby was given ""a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury."" Libby can still appeal his conviction. And if the appeal fails or is still in process at the end of Bush's term, the president could grant Libby a full pardon. Libby's conviction is linked to the investigation into the 2003 leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity. An outraged Joe Wilson, Plame's husband, spoke to CNN shortly after the ruling. Wilson had gone public with allegations that the Bush administration had ""twisted"" the evidence used to justify the invasion of Iraq, and prosecutors argued that Libby disclosed her employment as part of an effort to discredit him. ""I have nothing to say to Scooter Libby,"" Wilson said. ""I don't owe this administration. They owe my wife and my family an apology for having betrayed her. Scooter Libby is a traitor."" Libby was not accused of disclosing Plame's identity himself. But at trial, special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald told the jury that Libby's actions left ""a cloud over the White House"" by obstructing the leak probe. In a statement issued Monday night, Fitzgerald took issue with Bush's description of the sentence as ""excessive,"" saying it was ""imposed pursuant to the laws governing sentencings which occur every day throughout this country."" ""It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals,"" Fitzgerald said. ""That principle guided the judge during both the trial and the sentencing."" Plame had worked in the CIA's counter-proliferation division before the March 2003 invasion. She told a congressional committee in March that her exposure effectively ended her career and endangered ""entire networks"" of agents overseas. Her husband said Bush's action today demonstrates that the White House is ""corrupt from top to bottom."" Clemency petitions are normally reviewed by the Justice Department, which investigates the case and seeks input from the federal prosecutor who brought the case before issuing a recommendation to the president. A government official said that Bush did not consult with the Justice Department before rendering his decision. Reaction on Capitol Hill was swift. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said the president had ""abandoned all sense of fairness when it comes to justice."" ""The president's commutation of Scooter Libby's prison sentence does not serve justice, condones criminal conduct, and is a betrayal of trust of the American people,"" she said. One of the few members of the GOP backing Bush, House Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri, said the commutation was ""the right thing to do."" ""The prison sentence was overly harsh, and the punishment did not fit the crime,"" Blunt said. Plame's name became public when Robert Novak named her in his column on July 14, 2003. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has admitted he disclosed the information to a reporter. Novak pointed to another ""senior administration official"" -- Bush political adviser Karl Rove -- as the second source for his column. No one has been charged with leaking classified information in the case, but a jury found Libby guilty of trying to deceive investigators and a grand jury during the investigation. Bush was under great pressure to grant a pardon to Libby. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, is the highest-ranking White House official ordered to prison since the Iran-Contra affair. Polls suggest the American public may not be happy with Libby's commutation. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken in March asked if Bush should pardon Libby -- 69 percent said no, 18 percent said yes. Ted Wells, an attorney for Libby, issued a statement late Monday saying that Libby and his family ""wish to express their gratitude for the president's decision."" ""We continue to believe in Mr. Libby's innocence,"" Wells said. ""Scooter and his family appreciate the many Americans who have supported them over the last two years.""

"Score one for the feds. An investigation encompassing everything from fake NFL game jerseys to counterfeit Super Bowl tickets ended with more than $17 million worth of items seized and 41 people arrested, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The federal agency began its probe -- which it dubbed ""Operation Red Zone"" in reference to the area between the 20-yard line and goal line for a football team's offense -- on September 1, 2012, and wrapped it up on February 6. ICE special agents, U.S. Postal Inspection Service members and state and local police officers nationwide conducted the investigation, in conjunction with the NFL and other top sports leagues. They targeted international shipments of merchandise while also focusing on places where such items might be stored or sold, such as warehouses, stores, flea markets, street vendors and online vendors. By the time they were done, authorities had seized $17.3 million in unlicensed jerseys, hats, T-shirts, jackets and other souvenirs, ICE said. Plus, federal agents shut down 313 websites on which counterfeit merchandise was hawked. ""The seized websites are now in the custody of the federal government,"" according to the ICE press release. The effort -- which included the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center -- also looked at counterfeit tickets, specifically for the Super Bowl, the NFL's championship game. This led to the confiscation of 168 tickets valued at more than $154,000.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement led ""Operation Red Zone""

"Another royal baby is on the way. Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to become parents for a second time, Buckingham Palace announced Monday. ""The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news,"" the palace said. It didn't say when the due date will be. As during her first pregnancy, Catherine is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, the palace said. The condition involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy. She is being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace and didn't accompany Prince William on a planned visit Monday to Oxford. The decision to announce the pregnancy was made when it became apparent Catherine was not well enough to go on the Oxford trip and that a number of other forthcoming engagements could be affected, a royal source told CNN. Why does the 'spare heir' matter? ""The couple only found out very recently. The Duchess has not even reached the crucial 12-week stage,"" the source said. William told reporters in Oxford that the couple were thrilled and Catherine was ""feeling OK."" ""It's been a tricky few days,"" he said. ""We're hoping things settle down soon and she feels better."" The couple's first child, Prince George, was born in July 2013. The second child will become fourth in line to the British throne. Prince Charles is first in line, followed by William, Prince George and then eventually the new baby. The new child will knock future uncle Prince Harry down to fifth.

"Sierra Leone plans a three-day nationwide lockdown in an effort to halt an Ebola outbreak that has killed hundreds, a move that a leading medical charity said Saturday will not help. People will not be allowed to leave their homes for three days under the plan, set to start September 19. The lockdown is being billed as a predominantly social campaign rather than a medical one, in which volunteers will go door-to-door to talk to people. ""We believe this the best way for now to identify those who are sick and remove them from those who are well,"" said Alhaji Alpha Kanu, Sierra Leone's minister of information and communication. But Médecins Sans Frontières, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said such a lockdown is unlikely to stop the spread of the disease. ""Large scale coercive measures like forced quarantines and lockdowns are driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers. This is leading to the concealment of cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems,"" the charity group said in a statement. ""This is leading to the concealment of potential cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems."" It's not the first time a quarantine or lockdown has been tried. In August, the Liberian government locked down one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital of Monrovia in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. The move resulted in riots. 21,000 volunteers to go door-to-door . Sierra Leone set the lockdown date for September 19-21 to give the country time to train volunteers and get needed equipment, such as ambulances, Kanu said. During the lockdown, 21,000 volunteers will fan out across the nation to talk with people about how to protect themselves from the disease, as well as identify Ebola cases, Kanu said. It was unclear how many of these volunteers would be health workers. The information minister described the volunteers as young people from the very communities where they will be working. ""Resistance will be less. They will be talking to people they know,"" Kanu said. He did not say what punishment, if any, people would face for violating the lockdown. Ebola typically kills 90% of those infected with the virus, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped because of early treatment. Even so, MSF questioned such a plan. ""It will be extremely difficult for health workers to accurately identify cases through door-to-door screenings as this requires a certain level of expertise,"" the group said. ""And when cases are identified, there will not be enough Ebola management centers to care for them."" Number of cases on the rise . Also, there is a question of what a three-day lockdown will do to slow the spread of the virus, given that the Ebola incubation period can range between two and 21 days. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. More than 3,600 people have been diagnosed with Ebola since the first documented case in December, the World Health Organization has said. Of those cases, there have been 1,800 fatalities, the agency has said. More than 40% of the cases have been diagnosed in the past three weeks, the agency said. The outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with a handful of cases in Nigeria. The overall fatality rate is 50%, WHO said, ranging from 39% in Sierra Leone to 64% in Guinea, according to the latest figures. WHO says it believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa, passing on the virus to other animals. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. The same year there was another outbreak in Sudan. While there is no known cure or vaccine available, the first human trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine began this last week.","Sierra Leone is giving itself time to train volunteers and get needed equipment .

"Ebola is very much on the minds of Americans, as 8 in 10 Americans believe someone new will be diagnosed with the disease in the coming weeks. But there is overwhelming confidence in the federal government's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic, a new CNN/ORC International Poll shows. More than 7 in 10 Americans say the federal government can stop an Ebola epidemic, and 54% believe the federal government is doing a ""good job"" in addressing the disease. The high marks on the government's response to Ebola come at the same time that President Barack Obama's overall approval rating is only 45% and Americans are angry over the direction of the country. A slightly smaller majority of Americans, 53%, think that hospitals and healthcare workers in their community are prepared to treat an Ebola case, but only 26% believe that someone in their area will become infected with the disease in the next few weeks. ""Most Americans seem to recognize that they are not in personal jeopardy themselves,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""In fact, the vast majority of Americans probably don't know anyone who has ever been to West Africa."" The poll comes as a national discussion over how to process people traveling from the Ebola hot zones into the United States is taking place. It shows that only 3 in 10 Americans believe the U.S. government should prevent foreign citizens traveling from West Africa from entering the U.S, while 2 in 10 Americans say that U.S. citizens returning from the hot zone should be stopped from entering the country. A strong majority, though, are in favor of quarantining people who show signs of having contracted the disease. More than 7 in 10 Americans say the federal government should take steps to treat Ebola in both Africa and the U.S., while 27% believe that it should be addressed only here in the U.S. The U.S. government has sent military troops to the hot zone to provide assistance. On Monday, 11 personnel including Army Major General Darryl A. Williams were placed under ""controlled monitoring"" at a U.S. base in Italy after returning from West Africa. Americans are split 50% to 48% when asked if they would take an Ebola vaccine if it became available. In terms of the midterm elections, 36% of Americans say Ebola will be ""extremely important"" to their vote for Congress -- placing it right in the middle of the most important issues on people's minds, according to the poll.

"(CNN) -- A doctor who was on the front lines fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone has died from complications of the disease, Doctors Without Borders said Tuesday. Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan fell ill early last week while overseeing Ebola treatment at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown. He was treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -- also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, up until his death, spokesman Tim Shenk said. ""RIP Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan,"" wrote one of the many people who remembered Khan fondly on Twitter. ""What a hero. What a loss."" A University of Sierra Leone graduate, Khan worked for that African country's Ministry of Health and Sanitation, including as head of the Lassa fever program at Kenema Government Hospital, according to the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium. Lassa fever is a virus common in west Africa, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes. While in that latter post, Khan contracted with the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, consulted with the World Health Organization/Tulane University on its Mano River Union Lassa fever network and was physician-in-charge of his hospital's HIV/AIDS program. ""His valiant work will not be forgotten,"" Dr. Penninah Iutung Amor, AIDS Healthcare Foundation's Africa bureau chief, said in a statement. ""In a country that has fewer than 200 medical doctors in its entire public health sector, the loss of even one doctor is a loss too great."" Khan continued his training in Ghana from 2010 to 2013, before returning to head the Kenema Government Hospital's Lassa fever program and becoming a lecturer at the University of Sierra Leone. The Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium described him as ""one of the world's leading experts in the clinical care of viral hemorrhagic fevers"" -- among them, Ebola. This disease typically kills 90% of those infected, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60% because of early treatment. The outbreak is happening primarily in three West African countries: Guinea, where it began, Liberia and Sierra Leone. As of July 23, the World Health Organization had confirmed more than 800 Ebola cases in the region, but it suspects there have been many unreported infections and there may be as many as 1,200 cases. Sierra Leone has been hardest hit, with approximately 525 cases. ""Dr. Khan was an extremely determined and courageous doctor who cared deeply for his patients,"" Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. ""His work and dedication have been greatly appreciated by the medical community in Sierra Leone for many years. He will be remembered and missed by many, especially by the doctors and nurses that worked with him. MSF's sincere thoughts and condolences are with Dr. Khan's family, friends and colleagues.""

"Arizona suspect Joseph Andrew Dekenipp went from jailbird, to lovebird, and back to jailbird -- all in three hours. Dekenipp was determined to spend Valentine's Day with his girlfriend, CNN affiliate KTVK reported. So much so that he crawled past razor wire, scaled two fences and made his way to a bar about 10 miles away, according to authorities. Dekenipp went missing Friday afternoon from a fenced recreation yard at the detention center in Florence, according to the affiliate. When inmates there returned to their residential units, Dekenipp was nowhere to be found. He'd made the daring escape and was headed to a bar in nearby Coolidge, where he was going to meet his girlfriend, the affiliate said. Pinal County deputies used K-9s to track him, but then his scent disappeared, the affiliate said. They pulled over cars on nearby roadways and searched them. Their big break came when two teens told authorities that their friend gave Dekenipp a ride to the bar. Deputies hightailed it there, where they found Dekenipp. And no, he wasn't wearing his jail uniform. Three hours after his escape, his handcuffs clinked shut again without incident. He was hauled back to Pinal County Adult Detention Center. Dekenipp had been booked in jail last month on various charges, including suspected car theft, unlawful flight and driving on a suspended license, the affiliate reported. At the time, he was held on a $5,000 bond and had a pretrial hearing set for February 25, according to the affiliate. The lovebird -- and jailbird -- may be apart from his girlfriend for a longer period. In addition to all that, he's now facing an escape charge. Michigan prison escapee captured in Indiana .

"Both men lit themselves on fire in protest. But only one of them is credited with starting a revolution. The difference between the two? Mobile phones recorded Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian fruit vendor, as he set himself ablaze in despair over his economic plight. Those videos kicked off the wave of 2011 Arab Spring demonstrations. Abdesslem Trimech, the other man, fell into relative obscurity. The example, cited in the book ""The Mobile Wave,"" highlights just one of the many superpowers that mobile phones -- and to a lesser extent, tablets -- have bestowed upon humanity. In addition to enabling us to video events on a second's notice, potentially altering the course of global politics, these high-tech human ""appendages"" increasingly have become tools for fighting corruption, buying stuff, bolstering memory, promoting politics, improving education and giving people around the world more access to health care. They've shaken up our social lives, too. Forget letters and phone calls. Texts are the currency of modern conversation -- and mobile Internet searches are the way to solve disputes of fact or trivia. Dating apps search suitors by location, and mobile maps ensure we app-enabled superhumans can't get lost, as long as there's a wireless signal. Superman could fly. Phones, it seems, help us do everything but. At a time when new smartphones seem to hit the market every couple of days and our faces increasingly are glued to digital screens, CNN is taking a special look at the myriad ways mobile technology is affecting our lives. The monthlong series is called ""Our Mobile Society."" ""This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way,"" Amber Case, a ""cyborg anthropologist,"" said in a 2010 lecture at TEDWomen. ""And it's not that machines are taking over. It's that they're helping us to be more human. They're helping us to connect to each other. The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives."" 'Like a phantom limb' Phones are so cherished -- or so depended upon -- that 68% of us sleep with them at our bedside, according to a 5,000-person global survey conducted by Qualcomm and Time, which shares a parent company with CNN. Three-quarters of Americans surveyed said being ""constantly connected by technology"" is helpful. Some take that idea to extremes. Michael Saylor, author of ""The Mobile Wave"" and CEO of MicroStrategy, said he checks his phone for updates at least once a minute -- ""I must look at it 500 times a day, or 1,000 times a day,"" he said. Almost nothing would make him put his phone down. ""If I was with the queen of England and she was addressing me directly and it was a one-on-one conversation, then I would probably discipline myself to not look at my phone, so as to not show disrespect to her."" The phone, otherwise, is just too helpful at keeping Saylor linked, constantly, to his colleagues and friends, who send him a fire hose of instant messages and updates. For all the potential benefits, however, Case and other observers of mobile culture see negative consequences as well. Being connected digitally to everyone all the time also can lead, somewhat surprisingly, to a sense of isolation and loneliness. ""Teenagers tell me they sleep with their cell phone, and even when it isn't on their person, when it has been banished to the school locker, for instance, they know when their phone is vibrating,"" MIT professor Sherry Turkle writes in the book ""Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other."" ""The technology has become like a phantom limb, it is so much a part of them. These young people are among the first to grow up with an expectation of continuous connection: always on, and always on them."" Another young person, age 13, told Turkle she doesn't like to pick up the phone, only text. ""Texting offers just the right amount of access, just the right amount of control,"" the author writes. ""She is a modern Goldilocks: for her, texting puts people not too close, not too far, but at just the right distance. The world is now full of modern Goldilockses, people who take comfort in being in touch with a lot of people whom they also keep at bay."" Nearly 6 billion phones . Regardless of the effects, adoption of mobile tech seems to be going only one direction: up. There were nearly 6 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide in 2011, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a branch of the United Nations. There are 7 billion people in the world. Some have multiple mobile contracts, but technology is clearly widespread. And getting smarter. Saylor, the author and CEO, estimates 5 billion people will have smartphones in the next five years, giving those people access to the mobile Internet and apps. The United States already reached a tipping point this year: The majority of American phone owners now have smartphones. These phones, such as those running the Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems, offer ""more computing power than Apollo 11 when it landed a man on the moon,"" Nancy Gibbs writes for Time. ""In many parts of the world, more people have access to a mobile device than to a toilet or running water,"" she writes. ""For millions, this is the first phone they've ever had."" Gibbs and other writers cite the astounding speed with which mobile phones have come to dominate our lives in the decades since Martin Cooper, from Motorola, placed the first public cellular telephone call on a brick-size phone in 1973. (He called a competitor at Bell Labs, in case you're curious.) It took years for mobile-networking technology to develop and for cellular towers to go up. After mobile calls became more commonplace in a few developed countries, manufacturers added keyboards and larger screens, clearing the way for the SMS and mobile e-mail revolutions. By the 2000s, a host of sensors -- from GPS, which enables mobile mapping, to accelerometers, which helps the phone know if it's being tilted -- were being squeezed into the gadgets. The mother of all smartphones, the Apple iPhone, debuted in 2007 with all these accouterments. By then, phones had become the warehouse for technological innovation -- the Swiss Army knives of modern living, as many authors have argued. If you include tablets and e-readers in the mix, mobile devices have come to rival desktop computers and laptops for their usefulness in life and business. ""The reason why mobile technology is uniquely interesting to the world right now is because it represents the fifth wave of computing,"" Saylor said, with smartphones following Internet-enabled computing, desktops, minicomputers and early computer mainframes on the timeline. ""And technology really is about what happens to the entire civilization of some several billion people or more when there is useful software running on the person and in the hand of everybody, every minute of the day."" Smartphone superpowers . There are plenty of potential superpowers these always-on mobile gadgets could give us. One of the more futuristic, as outlined by Google this year, is a sort of digital X-ray, or ""Terminator"" vision. Using augmented-reality technology, that company and others hope to superimpose a layer of digital information on top of the real world. A person wearing Google's prototype of high-tech glasses, for example, might see data about people they encounter or about deals offered inside restaurants they pass. Other efforts aim to empower people literally to open doors or pay for coffee with a tap of their phone, and to identify themselves using NFC chips that are built into newer smartphones. Meanwhile, schools in rural parts of Africa that never had textbooks are incorporating smartphones as an information source with the help of Paul Kim, chief technology officer at Stanford University. ""I know they are not only using the technology,"" Kim said, ""but they are getting smarter and smarter every day."" And researchers, including George Whitesides at Harvard University, are trying to use mobile phones to bring medical care to remote corners of the world where people otherwise would have to walk for a day or more to see a doctor or nurse. Whitesides' group has been working on a paper chip that could be touched with a drop of blood and then photographed and text messaged to a clinic that could analyze it and offer a diagnosis. Suddenly, doctors have the superhuman ability to see patients far afield. New implementations for smartphones don't always work, of course, Stanford's Kim said. But over time, there's hope smartphones will be a radical, democratizing force -- particularly as they become more affordable for everyone. ""The Agricultural Revolution took thousands of years to run its course. The Industrial Revolution required a few centuries. The Information Revolution, propelled by mobile technology will likely reshape our world on the order of decades,"" Saylor writes. ""But despite the turbulence ahead, we live at one of the greatest times in history. Software will suffuse the planet, filling in every niche, and exciting opportunities will lie everywhere.""","Mobile phones have become human ""appendages"" or ""phantom limbs""

"The average high school graduation rate in America's biggest urban school districts, which serve large numbers of children from very disadvantaged backgrounds, is only about 50%.  In most cities, the figure is even lower for African-American males. Unfortunately, remarkably few strategies have been shown to improve the schooling outcomes of disadvantaged children, particularly once they reach adolescence. This has led many people to conclude that the harmful effects of poverty are already so entrenched by adolescence that improving academic learning for low-income teens is not feasible. Many experts have called for focusing instead on vocational education for these youth or just doubling down on early childhood. Given all this, some may even question the prospects for success of President Obama's new initiative to help young minority men, My Brother's Keeper. We believe it's premature to conclude that by adolescence, it's too late to improve schooling outcomes. Few approaches have addressed one of the central challenges facing so many urban schools: the wide variation in students' academic levels by the time they reach middle and high school. Consider trying to teach math to a classroom of 25 to 30 students when some students are at grade level and some are seven or even 10 years behind. Now imagine the same situation from the students' perspective. Asking kids to sit through material so far beyond their knowledge is a recipe for disengagement and dropout. What urban school systems need is a ""safety net"" to catch students who start falling behind and get them back to up to grade level so they can re-engage with regular classroom instruction. This safety net must include academic instruction that is both individualized and intensive. Educators have long known that one-on-one or small-group tutoring is the most effective way to teach people anything. But most urban school systems struggle with the costs of having one teacher in a room with 25 (or more) students; how could we ever have a class size of just one or two students per instructor? One possible answer comes from Match Education of Boston, a nonprofit organization that runs charter schools and a teacher training program and provides tutoring services to urban districts.  Match had the insight that teaching one or two students at a time eliminates some of the biggest challenges involved in teaching a whole classroom of students (like classroom management). Many more people can be good at tutoring compared with being good at classroom teaching; extensive teacher experience and training are not required. This enables Match to expand the pool of recruits and focus on those with strong math skills who are willing to devote a year to public service for just a modest stipend. This makes the incredibly high dosage of the Match tutoring model feasible. Match has partnered with urban school districts in cities across the country to provide this ""tutoring on steroids"" model to hundreds of students in each city. The cost of providing this type of intensive tutoring is between $2,000 and $3,000 per student per year. Of course, the education field is full of good ideas that don't pan out in practice; how does this Match tutoring model actually work in practice? How effective is it really? Last year, our University of Chicago Urban Education Lab tried to answer this question by carrying out a randomized controlled trial of the sort that provides gold-standard evidence in medicine but which remains far too rare in education. We randomly assigned 106 male ninth- and 10th-graders in one Chicago public high school to receive Match-style tutoring for a year and to participate in a promising non-academic program called Becoming a Man, developed and delivered by the Chicago nonprofit Youth Guidance. Our study showed that program participation for just six months improved student math test scores by an amount that is equal to what the average U.S. high school student learns in three years. (Or put differently, the effect equals about 60% of the black-white test score gap in data collected for U.S. students overall.) The program also improved math grades, reduced course failures, increased school attendance and increased by nearly 50% the likelihood that youth were ""on track"" for graduation according to the Chicago Public Schools on-track indicator. The cost of providing students with both intensive individualized math tutoring and the opportunity to participate in BAM was about $4,400 per student per year. While this may seem expensive, the benefits of the program were so large that the cost-effectiveness of these programs compares favorably to other social investments that have been shown to be effective (e.g. early childhood education, cash transfers from the Earned Income Tax Credit, or reductions in class sizes). Moreover, cities like Chicago currently receive millions of dollars from the federal government to support tutoring, which in principle could be repurposed to cover the costs of providing Match-style tutoring to students who need an academic safety net. Our study results would be striking anywhere but are all the more so because the high school students in our study come from what is perhaps Chicago's most disadvantaged, dangerous South Side neighborhood. Whether this can be equally effective at large scale is the next key question to answer; our team is currently working on this in a much larger-scale experiment under way in 21 public high schools across Chicago. We think there are two important lessons here. The first is a policy lesson for urban school systems: They need something individualized and intensive, like Match tutoring, as a safety net to help prevent students who start falling behind from falling completely through the cracks. But there is also a larger lesson here that is relevant for social policy and criminal justice, not just education: It's not too late to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds even once they reach adolescence.","Jonathan Guryan, Jens Ludwig: Graduation rates for big urban schools about 50% .

"Benjamin Watson, a tight end for the New Orleans Saints, came home Monday night after a tough loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It was late and surely he was worn out. He turned on the television and saw everything that was going on in Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the grand jury decision. As he fixated at the screen, his heart hurt for the people there. The next day, he started to deal with his emotions -- and there were many. Watson, in his 11th NFL season, likes to write down his feelings, so throughout the day he jotted them on his iPhone. While sitting in a Target parking lot as his wife shopped, Watson went back and put the notes together into an emotional Facebook post. One you've probably heard about. And possibly read. That post has 427,000 shares and more than 760,000 likes. There were 78,000 comments at last look. In 611 words, Watson writes he is angry, frustrated, fearful, embarrassed, sad, sympathetic, offended, confused, introspective, hopeless, hopeful and encouraged. He told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday the two sections that resonated the most with him are the ones about introspection and encouragement: . -- I'M INTROSPECTIVE, because sometimes I want to take ""our"" side without looking at the facts in situations like these. Sometimes I feel like it's us against them. Sometimes I'm just as prejudiced as people I point fingers at. And that's not right. How can I look at white skin and make assumptions but not want assumptions made about me? That's not right. -- I'M ENCOURAGED, because ultimately the problem is not a SKIN problem, it is a SIN problem. SIN is the reason we rebel against authority. SIN is the reason we abuse our authority. SIN is the reason we are racist, prejudiced and lie to cover for our own. SIN is the reason we riot, loot and burn. BUT I'M ENCOURAGED because God has provided a solution for sin through ... his son Jesus and with it, a transformed heart and mind. One that's capable of looking past the outward and seeing what's truly important in every human being. The cure for the Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner tragedies is not education or exposure. It's the Gospel. So, finally, I'M ENCOURAGED because the Gospel gives mankind hope. While the religious nature of that final section may turn some readers off, Watson says he thinks it points to a way that people of different races can solve some of the issues they face. ""Internally our sin makes us prideful, it makes us judgmental, it makes us prejudice, which leads to racism, it makes us lash out at people that don't look like us. It makes us do all those things. It makes us lash out in anger and makes us point fingers,"" he told CNN. He finds the answers in the Gospels of the Bible. The message also spoke to many, many people. A comment about his boldness in proclaiming his faith landed 24,000 likes. Watson began his post facing his anger. ""It's OK to be angry and to identify your emotion as being angry, because like I said later we like to protect our own,"" he told CNN. ""Because of our life experiences, whether it is being a black American or a white American, because of stories that you've heard over time, because of injustices that have happened or maybe being accused of something you didn't do or being accused of being racist when you're not, we have these certain histories and we react because of those."" He said the key is to get past that first level of emotion. You have to understand why you are angry, he said. And then take it a step further. We need to understand the other side brings his own experiences to each situation. ""It's really important that we take a step back sometimes and think about the other side before we make accusations and assumptions,"" he said.","Benjamin Watson sometimes shares his thoughts about life on his Facebook page .

"Survivors have recalled the harrowing few minutes after Asiana Airlines Flight 214's landing gear slammed into a seawall around San Francisco's airport, setting off a chain of events including a fire, the ejection of flight attendants and a frenzied evacuation. But what about the minutes before the Boeing 777 crashed? A day after relaying pilots' accounts to investigators, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Deborah Hersman provided more details Wednesday on what happened in the sky. One focus has been whether ""automatic"" controls in the cockpit were working. Even if they weren't, questions have been raised about whether the pilots recognized that something was wrong quickly enough and did the right thing to fix it. Moments before touching down, the pilots said they were making horizontal changes to adjust their path and vertical adjustments to affect their altitude. Hersman has said they didn't notice they were coming into too low until they were about 200 feet above the airport. To put that in perspective, the independent Flight Safety Foundation states that most planes approaching an airport ""require... an immediate go-around"" -- meaning they should not land -- if they're not at the right speed on the right path by the time they're about 1,000 feet up. 'There are no ambulances out here': 911 calls detail horror of crash . In Flight 214's last 2½ minutes, the pilots were making adjustments, including, apparently, adjusting some automatic functions that control things like airspeed and other key factors. It's not clear how all those functions were working, but the pilots did say the ""auto throttle"" was switched on but didn't regulate the speed as they'd expected. ""We need to understand what those modes were: If they were commanded by the pilots, if they were activated inadvertently, and if the pilots knew what they were doing,"" the NTSB chairman said, referring to evidence of ""multiple autopilot modes and ... auto throttle modes."" Such tools can help an airliner run more efficiently and effectively. But they don't mean that pilots don't have a responsibility, Hersman said, noting that someone in the cockpit is typically charged with monitoring what's going on. ""When you think about automation, it can do a lot, it can assist the pilots,"" Hersman told reporters. ""But there are two pilots in the cockpit for a reason."" Co-pilots for airlines will need more training . The final minutes in the air . The man at the helm -- whom Hersman called the ""flying pilot"" and who was halfway through training on flying a 777 -- spent the day before the fatal flight at home and got about eight hours of sleep. When he reported to work, he told investigators, he arrived at the airport a little early, knowing he'd be working with his ""instructor pilot"" -- who would be seated next to him on the voyage across the Pacific -- for the first time, Hersman said. NTSB: Pilot was halfway through training to fly 777 . The instructor pilot was also relatively well-rested, having had a day off followed by eight hours of sleep. Together, they were in the front seats of Flight 214 for about 4 hours, 15 minutes before being relieved for about 5 hours by a relief crew on board. Then the two returned to their seats for the trip's last hour and a half, according to the NTSB chief. At around 4,000 feet above sea level, the pilots recognized they were coming in too high and made some adjustments, Hersman said. At 11:26 a.m. Saturday, when they were about a mile and a half away, they were given clearance to land. The three men in the cockpit told investigators the auto pilot was off but the auto throttle -- a device that automatically regulates speed -- was switched on and set to 137 knots (157 mph). After noticing the plane was too slow and too low, around 200 feet, the flying pilot pushed the throttle forward. Also, one of the pilots said that at some point, his sight was affected by a flash of light, something the NTSB chairman said authorities can't yet explain. The first minutes on the ground . While authorities have not laid blame or cited a cause, it appears the pilots' efforts in those last few minutes were too little, too late to avert a crash. The aircraft's main landing gear slammed into a seawall between the airport and San Francisco Bay. The tail pounded down soon after that. How does an air crash investigation work? The aircraft spun 360 degrees, shedding parts, flooring, magazines and more that would be later found strewn about the runway. Three flight attendants who were ejected from the plane were found on the runway too, Hersman said Wednesday. (None of the passengers' seats were ejected.) Eventually, the 777 screeched to a stop. That's when the lead flight attendant approached the cockpit and asked if they should evacuate. The flight crew, which was then talking with the air traffic control tower, said no. An announcement over the aircraft's speakers told passengers to stay in their seats. Then, one flight attendant noticed flames outside, around row 10, and told another attendant to relay the information to the cockpit. At that point, the evacuation process began. This whole process -- from the plane stopping to the evacuation order -- took about 90 seconds, Hersman said. That's the amount of time, she pointed out, in which U.S. regulators say an airliner should be entirely cleared of passengers and crew. About two minutes after the crash, the NTSB chief added, first responders were on site. About a minute later, there were firefighters equipped to douse any flames. 'Working as hard as possible ... to recover' But no one could save Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, the 16-year-old girls from China who died due to the crash. Girls killed in crash were headed for camp . On Wednesday, their relatives took a bus to the crash site at San Francisco International Airport, a source close to Asiana Airlines told CNN. They wanted to see where their children had died. Other buses arrived later Wednesday night bringing crash victims to the same locale, allowing them to see the destruction up close once again. Of the 307 passengers and crew aboard the Seoul-to-San Francisco flight, 305 survived. Out of those, 123 were uninjured, while the rest went to Bay Area hospitals. Some of them were still there Wednesday, including a handful in critical condition. Even those who aren't in hospitals are suffering. Six of the jet's 12 flight attendants suffered injuries serious enough that they haven't been interviewed yet by investigators, Hersman said Wednesday. The six others, meanwhile, appeared briefly in front of reporters Wednesday. One of them was in a wheelchair. (Hersman said that one of the flight attendants had broken her leg but was no longer hospitalized and had talked to the investigators.) Some wept. The flight's cabin manager, Yoon Hye Lee, said she and the rest of the crew are ""working as hard as possible in order to recover."" She added, ""I hope for all the families who have suffered losses from this accident to recover as quickly as possible, as they are in my prayers."" Flight attendants hailed as heroes .","Victims visit crash site at SFO, following relatives of 2 Chinese teens killed .

"Campus politics aren't always a clear winner for Rand Paul, as he discovered here this week during an appearance at the College of Charleston. The Kentucky Republican and potential 2016 contender opened with a familiar riff about government surveillance that won predictable applause -- especially from the many students who represented Young Americans for Liberty, the libertarian outfit created from the ashes of his father Ron Paul's presidential campaigns. Then a young woman in the audience asked if Paul, who sponsored an anti-abortion bill in 2013 that defines life as beginning at fertilization, is opposed to Plan B, the emergency contraception commonly known as the morning-after pill. A number of social conservatives -- plenty of them in Iowa -- have condemned the morning-after pill as an on-demand abortion drug, sometimes confusing the contraceptive with RU-486, which can be used to induce abortion. Noticeably uncomfortable with the question, Paul first gave a terse answer: ""I am not opposed to birth control,"" he said. After a pause, he elaborated. ""That's basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that."" Rand Paul: 'I am not opposed to birth control' Next question. The exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus -- a place where Paul has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda. And it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him: burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he doesn't stray so far from the Republican line that he won't be able to win the party's presidential nomination. Another student here pressed him on ""the drug war,"" asking if Paul would support legalizing marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He said he wasn't supportive of drug use, explaining that pot ""is not that great,"" but said drug laws should be left up to states. Colorado and Washington are experimenting with legalized marijuana, he said, and we should be watching carefully. Paul has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit. His visits to universities from Harvard to Howard have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from Republicans who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal. ""Rand Paul, Republican presidential hopeful, finds support in Berkeley, of all places,"" the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March. Paul, reared in libertarian politics, found support there because he railed against the National Security Administration's invasive surveillance operations, calling them an absurd violation of privacy. It's his go-to topic when he talks to young people. Last March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20-somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones. Soon after, he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee. Paul and his wife, Kelley, danced and sang along to Chumbawamba, the 90s-era pop band with an anarchist streak. We tagged along to the event at the College of Charleston for the latest episode of ""Hambycast."" After the talk, standing in the sun-splashed campus courtyard, I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people — as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with small-government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party. On the topic of drugs, I picked up where the student left off, wondering if Paul, as president, would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin. He hedged. ""My position has not been for legalization, my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this, and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance,"" he said. Then I asked about same-sex marriage, something Paul did not touch on in his remarks. Almost 80% of people under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year. It's hard to think of an issue on which Republicans are more out of step with America's youth. And it's not just teenaged and 20-somethings: A clear majority of Americans, 55%, support same-sex marriage. Paul favors traditional marriage, but has said states should determine their own marriage laws. ""I don't want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage,"" he told me. ""Founding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse. It is a local issue and always has been."" But can Republicans win a national election if they aren't in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter? He took a soft tone. ""Society's changing,"" he said. ""I mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they're like, oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue. So it's been rethought. The President's rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue."" It sounded, for a moment, as if Paul was hinting that he, too, could change his thinking about marriage. ""The bottom line is, I'm old fashioned, I'm a traditionalist,"" he said. ""I believe in old-fashioned traditional marriage. But, I don't really think the government needs to be too involved with this, and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue."" ""You could rethink it at some point, too?"" I asked him. He shrugged, and gave me a half-grimace. It wasn't a yes or a no, but it revealed Paul's complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party.","Rand Paul is visiting many college campuses to advance his libertarian agenda .

"The legislature of Mexico's Guerrero state must now find a replacement after the governor effectively stepped down, yielding to a growing political crisis over a mass kidnapping. After weeks of calls for his resignation, Gov. Angel Aguirre on Thursday asked for a leave of absence to put the focus back on solving the case of the missing students. By law, governors in Mexico cannot resign, so asking for a leave of absence can be a euphemism for stepping down in a crisis situation. The state legislature must name a new governor to finish Aguirre's term, which ends next year. His critics said Aguirre didn't act quickly enough in the days after 43 students went missing last month or take measures to minimize the impact of the crisis. The governor did not agree with that assessment. ""From the very first hours"" of the disappearance, the governor said, ""the state government took immediate measures to detain police officers who were directly involved and other individuals who were identified as participants in these criminal acts with the purpose of locating the missing students and pay the necessary attention to the victims."" Mexico's attorney general this week issued arrest warrants for the former mayor of Iguala, the city where the students were kidnapped; that official's wife; and the city's former public safety director. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam called the three the ""probable masterminds"" of the September 26 events in Iguala. That day, students from a teachers college in nearby Ayotzinapa were on their way to stage a protest in Iguala. When former Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife learned the protest would disrupt an event led by the latter, they gave orders to Public Safety Director Felipe Flores Velasquez to send police forces to prevent the students from protesting. ""The order to confront those people came from the police department's command center, straight from A-5, code name used to identify the Iguala mayor,"" Murillo said. The attorney general said his office learned the information from interrogations of police officers and gang members detained in the last month and allegedly involved in the incident. Police blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students as they arrived in buses and a van. One student was killed. Footage from the scene showed a white van left in the middle of the road with its windows blown out and the doors wide open. Officers took the students away, Murillo said, then handed them to a local criminal gang known as Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors), which not only had infiltrated the police department but was also complicit with Abarca, his wife and the public safety director. All three disappeared the day after the clashes between police and the students. Members of the Mexican federal police and army have taken over the Iguala Police Department and assumed all security responsibilities. The students remain missing, and 53 people, including 36 officers and 17 suspected gang members, have been detained. The recent discovery of 28 bodies in mass graves in Guerrero turned out not to be connected to the missing students. A Roman Catholic priest and well-known activist who works with migrants and trafficking victims revealed details this week about the kidnappings, saying the students were forced to walk to a remote location and then shot. ""Some who were wounded but still alive, with others who were already dead ... were put on top of firewood and set on fire with diesel,"" the Rev. Alejandro Solalinde said. He said he has given his information to prosecutors. The case has become a political crisis, with opposition lawmakers asking President Enrique Peña Nieto to dissolve the entire Guerrero state government and take charge. Peña Nieto has said his government will not spare any efforts until the students are found and justice is done. ""Violence, whatever its origin, goes against what we are as a country. Violence will never be a solution or pave the way toward a better future,"" the President said. Mexican authorities are offering a reward of nearly $5 million for information leading to the students and solving the case.","The Guerrero state legislature must now find a replacement .

"On May 16 last year, a 22-year-old Austrian named Maqsood Lodin was being questioned by police in Berlin. He had recently returned from Pakistan via Budapest, Hungary, and then traveled overland to Germany. His interrogators were surprised to find that hidden in his underpants were a digital storage device and memory cards. Buried inside them was a pornographic video called ""Kick Ass"" -- and a file marked ""Sexy Tanja."" Several weeks later, after laborious efforts to crack a password and software to make the file almost invisible, German investigators discovered encoded inside the actual video a treasure trove of intelligence -- more than 100 al Qaeda documents that included an inside track on some of the terror group's most audacious plots and a road map for future operations. Future plots include the idea of seizing cruise ships and carrying out attacks in Europe similar to the gun attacks by Pakistani militants that paralyzed the Indian city of Mumbai in November 2008. Ten gunmen killed 164 people in that three-day rampage. Terrorist training manuals in PDF format in German, English and Arabic were among the documents, too, according to intelligence sources. More: Details revealed on London bombings | Liquid bomb plot origins . U.S. intelligence sources tell CNN that the documents uncovered are ""pure gold;"" one source says that they are the most important haul of al Qaeda materials in the last year, besides those found when U.S. Navy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a year ago and killed the al Qaeda leader. One document was called ""Future Works."" Its authorship is unclear, but intelligence officials believe it came from al Qaeda's inner core. It may have been the work of Younis al Mauretani, a senior al Qaeda operative until his capture by Pakistani police in 2011. The document appears to have been the product of discussions to find new targets and methods of attack. German investigators believe it was written in 2009 -- and that it remains the template for al Qaeda's plans. Investigative journalist Yassin Musharbash, a reporter with the German newspaper Die Zeit, was the first to report on the documents. One plan: to seize passenger ships. According to Musharbash, the writer ""says that we could hijack a passenger ship and use it to pressurize the public."" Musharbash takes that to mean that the terrorists ""would then start executing passengers on those ships and demand the release of particular prisoners."" The plan would include dressing passengers in orange jump suits, as if they were al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and then videotaping their execution. Lodin and a man called Yusuf Ocak, who allegedly traveled back to Europe with him, are now on trial in Berlin where they are pleading not guilty. Ocak was detained in Vienna two weeks after Lodin's arrest. According to a senior Western counterterrorism official, their names were on a watch list, and when they handed over documents at a European border crossing, their names registered with counterterrorism agencies. Both men have pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges. Ocak is also charged with helping to form a group called the German Taliban Mujahedeen, and is alleged to have made a video for the group threatening attacks in Germany. Prosecutors believe the pair met at a terrorist training camp in Pakistan's tribal territories and were sent back to Europe to recruit a network of suicide bombers. ""We do not know what those men were up to but there are certain files of information that would make it plausible that they were probably thinking of a Mumbai-style attack,"" says Musharbash. In the fall of 2010, a year after the document was written, European intelligence agencies were scrambling to investigate a Mumbai-style plot involving German and other European militants -- which sparked an unprecedented U.S. State Department travel warning for Americans in Europe. ""I think it is plausible to think that the 'Future Works' document is part of that particular project,"" says Musharbash. ""Future Works"" suggests al Qaeda was an organization under great pressure, without a major attack to its name in several years, harried by Western intelligence. If anything, its predicament is even more dire today. ""The document delivers very clearly the notion that al Qaeda knows it is being followed very closely,"" Musharbash tells CNN. ""It specifically says that Western intelligence agencies have become very good at spoiling attacks, that they have to come up with new ways and better plotting."" Part of the response, according to the document, should be to train European jihadists quickly and send them home -- rather than use them as fighters in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- with instructions on how to keep in secret contact with their handlers. What emerges from the document is a twin-track strategy -- with the author apparently convinced that al Qaeda needs low-cost, low-tech attacks (perhaps such as the recent gun attacks in France carried out by Mohammed Merah) to keep security services preoccupied while it plans large-scale attacks on a scale similar to 9/11. Those already under suspicion in Europe and elsewhere would be used as decoys, while others would prepare major attacks. That is yet to materialize, but Musharbash believes a complex gun attack in Europe is still on al Qaeda's radar. ""I believe that the general idea is still alive and I believe that as soon as al Qaeda has the capacities to go after that scenario, they will immediately do it,"" he says. While ""Future Works"" does not include dates or places, nor specific plans, it appears to be a brainstorming exercise to seize the initiative -- and reinstate al Qaeda on front pages around the world.","German officials discovered al Qaeda documents encoded on porn video .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- An Oakland, California, police officer who was critically wounded in a weekend gunbattle with a suspect has died, the Alameda County Coroner's Office told CNN on Tuesday. Oakland, California, police Officer John Hege has died after a weekend shooting, a coroner's office says. John Hege, 41, had been pronounced brain dead Sunday. Police initially had said he was the fourth officer to die after a gunman opened fire on police in two separate incidents. But they later clarified that while Hege was pronounced brain dead, his body was being kept on life support until a decision could be made on an organ donation. Oakland police did not immediately respond to a CNN query Tuesday on what decision was made. However, the San Francisco Chronicle quoted Hege's father, John S. Hege, as saying his son's organs would be donated. After the officers were shot, the alleged gunman -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gunbattle with SWAT officers in a nearby apartment complex where he was hiding. Authorities said Saturday night that Mixon had an extensive criminal history and was in violation of parole for assault with a deadly weapon.  Watch how violence plagues Oakland » . The incidents began about 1 p.m. Saturday (4 p.m. ET) in east Oakland, when two motorcycle officers tried to pull over a car for a ""fairly routine traffic stop,"" said Dave Kozicki, deputy police chief. Immediately afterward, emergency dispatchers received reports that two officers had been shot, were down at the scene and needed help, he said. Those officers were Hege and Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, an 18-year veteran of the force. Dunakin died Saturday. Soon after the first shooting, police launched an intense manhunt to track down the gunman. An anonymous caller directed authorities to a building on an adjacent street where he was believed to be barricaded, said acting Police Chief Howard Jordan. The gunman opened fire on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two more officers, before police returned fire, killing the suspect, Jordan said. Those two officers -- Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35 -- were also killed. Police said Romans had been with the department since 1996 and Sakai since 2000. A fifth officer was treated at a hospital and released after being grazed by a bullet, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Saturday. It was the deadliest attack on California law enforcement since 1970, when four California Highway Patrol officers were shot and killed by two men in the Santa Clarita Valley, the Chronicle said. On Monday, police said in a statement that a ""tentative match"" had been established to Mixon from evidence recovered from a February sexual assault. ""Mixon is the primary suspect in the sexual assault case,"" the statement said. ""OPD is continuing our investigation into this matter."" However, the statement said, ""a tentative match is not a 100 percent match; it is considered to be a probable match. Further tests will be done on the DNA in question."" California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a statement Saturday, said flags at the state capitol would be flown at half-staff in honor of the officers.","Officer was brain dead Sunday, kept on life support pending organ decision .

The shooting started in a neighborhood in Samson, a town of about 3,000 about 15 miles north of the Florida border, just after 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) and ended 12 miles away at a manufacturing plant in Geneva, said Alabama state Sen. Harri Anne Smith, who represents Geneva County. ""He was shooting at just ordinary people going about their business,"" Smith told CNN, saying she had been briefed by state and local law enforcement. The gunman, whose identity was not disclosed, shot himself at the Reliable Metal Products plant, state public safety spokesman Kevin Cook told CNN. Authorities are also investigating an arson at a residence in neighboring Coffee County, where a body was found. That incident is thought to be related to the shootings, Cook said. Investigators are trying to determine whether the gunman, who Cook said was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, knew any of the victims. State police Cpl. Steve Jarrett told reporters that the gunman killed six adults and one child in three residences in Samson, before heading down state Highway 52, firing at least seven bullets into a state trooper car. The trooper sustained minor injuries from shattered glass. Geneva County Sheriff Greg Ward said one of his deputies lost his wife and toddler in the shooting at the first house. An infant was also wounded.  Watch Sheriff Ward describe what happened » . ""I can't describe what happened, why it happened,"" Ward told CNN affiliate WTVY. ""It's just a sad day for Geneva County."" The gunman then killed another person at Samson Pipe and Supply and then another at a service station -- both on Highway 52, Jarrett said.

"Democrats in key Senate races are showing some strength in the final stretch of election season -- but it may not be enough to keep the chamber. A new CNN/ORC poll released Friday shows Democrat Michelle Nunn leading Republican David Perdue 47% to 44% among likely voters. A WAFB poll out this week in Louisiana found incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu four points ahead of Republican Bill Cassidy. And a recent Courier-Journal/Survey USA poll in Kentucky found Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes trailing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell by just one point. It's enough to make Democrats feel cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold onto the Senate. But there's a problem: in two of the races -- Georgia and Louisiana -- Democrats will need to win at least 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff. And neither candidate is clearing that threshold in polls. The stakes are huge. Democrats could upend Republican hopes of picking up the net gain of six seats needed to claim the Senate if they find a way to succeed in these races without a runoff. The good news-bad news scenario is reflected in today's Georgia poll. ""It is a surprising show of strength for a Democrat in a state in which no Democrat has won a statewide election in over a decade,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Democratic and Republican consultants credit Nunn, daughter of former senator Sam Nunn, with running a strong campaign. She gained momentum in recent weeks by slamming one of former CEO Perdue's supposed strengths: his business record, and accused him of shipping US jobs overseas. The CNN poll also shows Nunn beating Perdue 51% to 47% in a run-off election that will take place on Jan. 6 if neither candidate wins in the first round. The data, however, is based on those likely to vote in November and the electorate in run-off elections typically differs from first round votes. As Nunn inches closer to the 50% threshold, her fate could lie with libertarian candidate Amanda Swafford, who is polling at 5% of likely voters. No one knows whether Swafford's supporters will gravitate to Perdue or simply stay home -- and their decision could have big implications for who wins the race. An idiosyncratic election system is also a problem for Democrats in Louisiana, where Sen. Mary Landrieu led the last five polls ahead of the state's open primary, which will send two candidates to a run-off if no one wins 50% of the vote. An outright win is eluding Landrieu. Though she's ahead of Cassidy, recent polls show her garnering only support in the high 30% to low 40% range. Even worse for Landrieu, when voters are asked if they plan to vote for Landrieu in the run-off, she trails Cassidy by between three and nine percent. Robert Hogan, a political science professor at Louisiana State University, said Landrieu has seen her state rapidly trend more Republican since she won the seat for the first time in 1996,  and says a run-off may be one step too far for her. ""I think that her support is probably around 42 or 43 percent,"" Hogan said. The runoffs will be even more crucial if the results determine control of the Senate. Such a scenario would unleash a torrent of national attention, campaign cash and duels by top party surrogates, which could produce cliffhanger election nights weeks after voters go to the polls in November.","Candidates in Louisiana and Georgia must win 50% to win a runoff .
Democrats in those states are ahead in some polls but haven't cleared 50% ."
"(CNET) -- Verizon Wireless smartphone customers use 25 percent more data than AT&T iPhone customers, thanks in large part to new Verizon's new Android smartphones, a recent study indicates. Validas, a company that analyzes cell phone bills and usage for consumers and corporate customers, analyzed 20,000 consumer phone bills between January and May of 2010 and discovered that Verizon Wireless smartphone customers consume on average about 421 megabytes per month. Meanwhile, AT&T iPhone users consume roughly 25 percent less data, or about 338 megabytes per month. The full Validas report will be published on September 1. The comparison between smartphone data usage on Verizon's network and iPhone data usage on AT&T's network is important to note, because iPhone users have typically been viewed as the heaviest data users in the entire mobile market. The fact that Verizon is seeing a major uptick in data usage in the past six months, largely due to new Android smartphones, could be a key predictor of wireless data usage patterns going forward. If the trends continue, Verizon could see an explosion in data usage. So far, Verizon's network hasn't faced any major hiccups due to the onslaught of new data traffic. This is in contrast to AT&T's network, which, over the past three years since the iPhone was launched, has beencriticized for dropping calls and offering slower than expected data download speedson their iPhones in some parts of the country. ""Verizon's network is holding up really well as it adds more data traffic,"" said Ed Finegold, chief analytics officer for Validas. ""Verizon has always had a reputation for a solid network. And it looks like so far, it has been able to handle the additional traffic."" As Verizon continues to sell more Android devices, the carrier will likely put its network to the test even further. Smartphone data usage started exploding for Verizon when the company launched its first Android phones in the fourth quarter last year, Finegold said. With more Android devices coming on the market in the next few months, it's likely that the volume of Android smartphones on Verizon's network will increase. That said, the total number of cell phone customers -- including those using feature phones and smartphones -- using Verizon data services is much less than the number of customers using these services on AT&T's network. For example, 71.2 percent of all AT&T cell phone subscribers, which includes users of smartphones like the iPhone as well as feature phones, use data services, while only 43 percent of all Verizon cell phone users subscribe to data services. Even though fewer Verizon cell phone subscribers are using data services, individually, they are consuming roughly the same amount of data each month as the average AT&T customer. AT&T cell phone subscribers, on average, consume 149.6MB a month. The average Verizon cell phone subscriber consumes about 147.2MB of data per month. When it comes to smartphones, usage patterns between AT&T and Verizon customers are also similar. But Verizon appears to have more power-users that fall in the midrange of data consumption. According to data analyzed by Validas, about half of AT&T's iPhone customers use less than 200MB of data per month. And about 47 percent of their iPhone subscribers use between 200MB and 2GB of data with about 90 percent of those customers using less than 1GB of data per month. This means that about 2.5 percent of AT&T's users consume more than 2GB of data per month. Hard-core data users . Verizon Wireless smartphone subscribers have similar usage patterns to those on AT&T's network. But where they differ is in the number of subscribers that are using between 500MB to 1GB per month of data. Verizon has twice as many of those customers than AT&T has, Finegold said. More than 11 percent of Verizon Wireless smartphone users fall into this category, versus just 5.6 percent of iPhone users. He speculates this difference is because Android users tend to be more hard-core data users, whereas the iPhone may be used more by casual users who like the phone because it's cool. ""The iPhone makes much more of a lifestyle and social statement than an Android phone makes,"" Finegold said. ""People interested in an Android are looking for horsepower."" In an effort to keep iPhone data usage in check so it doesn't completely overwhelm its network, AT&T recently eliminated its all you-can-eat data plan. Instead the company offers two tiers of services. For $15 a month, new smartphone subscribers can get up to 200MB of data per month. And for $25 a month they can get 2GB of data. Verizon still offers its unlimited data plan. Company executives emphasized that point at the launch of the new Motorola Droid X earlier this summer. But executives have also said that Verizon will eventually move to a tiered pricing model. AT&T's new pricing only affects a small number of customers. But if Verizon were to adopt the very same pricing model, more of its heavy data users on Android phones would likely be affected. According to the Validas report, a little more than 4 percent of Verizon's smartphone users consume more than 2GB of data per month compared with only about 2.5 percent of AT&T's iPhone customers. Validas' analysis also clearly shows that heavy data users are primarily using AT&T and Verizon Wireless, while customers who tend to use less data, are subscribing to Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA. For example, about half of Sprint's cell phone subscribers, including smartphone customers, use data on Sprint's network. But the average usage is only about 133.4MB a month. T-Mobile only has about 22.3 percent of its cell phone subscriber base subscribing to data, and those consumers are only using about 120MB of data per month. Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile want a bigger piece of the data action, which is why the companies have been investing in next-generation networks. Sprint is partnered with Clearwire, which is building its 4G network across the country using WiMax. Sprint recently launched the first WiMax-enabled phone that can switch between its 3G network and the 4G Clearwire network. Sales have been strong, but the company has suffered from component shortages making the devices hard to get. The Validas analysis doesn't include the launch of this new phone, called the HTC Evo. So it will be interesting to note whether the launch of this device will significantly move the needle on data usage on Sprint's network. Meanwhile, T-Mobile is also trying to strum up more data usage on its network by upgrading its network to the next generation of 3G technology called HSPA+. But even with faster network speeds in some markets, Sprint and T-Mobile still lack the comprehensive coverage that AT&T and Verizon offer. The biggest problem for Sprint and T-Mobile is putting the right devices in the hands of the most prolific data users. ""People who travel tend to be more mobile, and they also tend to be power users when it comes to mobile data,"" Finegold said. ""They want to know that the coverage is there when they need it, and they're generally more willing to pay for that. So they are definitely higher value customers."" © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"So Prince William and Duchess Kate are combining work with play this week, bringing their privileged progeny, Prince George, on a three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. I envy them. Having their own plane filled with personal staff would certainly make the 20-hour flight easier than the rest of us have it. For one, it's likely the royal staff don't roll their eyes in annoyance as Kate struggles to soothe George's wails, his little ears in pain due to changing air pressure. Nor does she have to beat the post-dinner in-flight pee rush and squeeze into a tiny washroom to change his royally soiled nappy. For most travelers, flying long haul with kids -- particularly babies -- stomps on any romantic notions of travel being about the journey, not the destination. As a Canadian mother who lives in Bangkok, Thailand, I've been taking my two boys -- now aged five and six -- on the 20-plus-hour multi-flight journey back home to see family annually since they were born. Here are a few key things I've learned along the way. 1. Before you go: Pre-order the kids' meals . Your average long-haul flight -- say, journeys of more than eight hours -- still serves meals in economy class for free. That's where the good news ends. To be fair, airline food has improved in recent years. But not much. When you peel back the foil top of that hot rectangular dish, exclamations of ""Man, I can't wait to dig into that grotesque mash-up of peas and rubbery chicken"" rarely follow. And good luck trying to serve it to your average five-year-old. (Go ahead, tell me your child is a wonderful eater who loves rubbery poultry and hard peas. Liar.) Fortunately, many airlines allow you to order child's meals when you book your flight. This is essential -- they usually only bring as many meals as were ordered, so extras are rare. Sample dishes my kids have had on recent flights include macaroni and cheese, ravioli with tomato sauce and simple fried rice with pork. I wanted to trade, they weren't having it. 2. A bit of junk food is OK . Yes, yes. Junk food is bad, the world is getting fat. But until you've experienced the horror of not sleeping in a bed for 30-plus hours because you promised your niece you'd fly from Bangkok to Cancun so your six-year-old could be a ring bearer in her wedding, you really can't judge a mom for letting her kids rip into a pack of Oreo cookies so she can have a few minutes of peace. On long-haul flights I always bring a few extra packs of snacks my kids are only allowed on rare occasions, along with their usual healthy goodies. But I avoid chocolate (messy) and other high-sugar items, for obvious reasons. Now is not the time for a sugar high, but neither is it an occasion to be too rigid about nutrition. Trust me, that little bag of potato chips is going to keep your kid quieter on those first critical moments of a flight than those organic/gluten-free/cranberry-flecked granola bars you whipped up a few hours earlier. Thai Airways even gives child fliers a metal cartoon-themed lunch box filled with a chocolate bar, a big juice box, gummy candies and cookies. I know. They're evil. Regardless of what you feed your kids, the chewing makes the air pressure changes easier on their ears. 3. Consider flying when they're asleep . Some kids can sleep anywhere. Others can't, and will meltdown into a terrifying, pig-tailed mini monster right before your horrified eyes. Ask yourself what category your kid fits into when booking that red-eye Tokyo-to-Atlanta flight. Personally, I prefer overnight flights as it gives me a chance to get some sleep as well. Maybe even watch a movie as I enjoy my meal of rubbery poultry and sneak in a glass of white wine. Plus, trying to fill an entire 13-hour flight with fun but quiet activities is challenging. By the end of one particularly long, sleep-free flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong I wanted to crawl into the aisle and let the flight attendants run me over with the drink cart to put me out of my misery. 4. Take advantage of early boarding . ""We now invite passengers with small children to begin boarding at this time."" When you hear these magic words, grab the kids and make a break for it. Sure, boarding first means even more time confined in close quarters with your darlings. But having a few extra minutes to get the kids settled as they fight over the window seat, and actually finding a space in the overhead compartment for your carry-on luggage right above your seat, are reward enough. 5. Bulkhead seats aren't for everyone . There's no denying the bulkhead seats are awesome. More leg room for you and extra space for toys is always a good thing on a flight with kids. If you're flying with a baby, it's also one of the few spots on the plane where the airline's bassinets can be set up. These need to be requested in advance but are highly recommended if your baby weighs under 25 pounds and you're flying for more than five hours. But remember, the armrests don't usually lift up in bulk-head seats as they have to store the tray tables. Not ideal if you are on a night flight and trying to get a two-year-old to sleep comfortably, which usually means lifting the armrest and spending a few hours with a pair of cute little legs stretched across your lap. 6. Gadgets good, ear buds bad . Remember what I said about junk food? The same thing applies to electronics. Now is not the time to adhere to your ""no more than 30 minutes of TV a day"" rule. The in-flight entertainment system is your best friend on a flight. Hours of kids' movies and TV shows. If you've got an iPhone or an iPad, load it up with new kid-friendly apps your children have never tried before you fly. It's also wise to buy some proper headphones that will fit on your kids' heads. Airline headsets -- especially those annoying ear buds -- aren't built for little ears. 7. The drugs don't work (for everyone) The first response from child-free people upon hearing you're flying overseas with your kids? ""Drug them."" As much as we all fantasize about enjoying a silent flight punctuated only by the light snores of heavily tranquilized children, bear in mind that shot of Benedryl you slipped little Jane before takeoff could backfire. It's wise to know the effects the medicine will have on her before your flight, as antihistamines can make some children hyper. You obviously don't want your three-year-old hopped up on cold meds, crooning the ""Little Einstein"" theme at the top of her lungs for 10 hours. Also worth bearing in mind, in some parenting circles drugging your kids is considered tantamount to child abuse. 8. The element of surprise . Along with the snacks, games and other meltdown prevention essentials you've packed -- their favorite blanket is a must -- it's wise to throw in a few surprises. Now that my boys are older I've stopped doing this but when they were around three and less enamored with their gadgets I found it useful to buy a few little treats to reveal mid-flight, which would occupy them for a few precious moments. Think noise-free goodies like stickers, new crayons, coloring books, puzzles, little cars and dolls.  Some airlines also offer free gift sets for kids, always a nice bonus. Meanwhile, if you let your kids pack their own bags of travel toys, you'd be wise to check what's going in there. My four-year-old son once slipped a plastic water pistol into his carry-on suitcase before the flight and sobbed in devastation -- ""But it's not reeeeeeaaaaal!"" -- as he watched an unsympathetic airport security agent chuck it into a garbage bin. 9. Don't forget who's in control . Most people get it. Kids are kids and some noise is expected. But it really is the parent's job to make sure their child is occupied and not driving everyone insane. Nobody is going to sympathize with the dude who lets his/her kid run wild around the plane shrieking or kicking the backs of people's seats while opening and closing the meal tray on a 12-hour cross-Pacific flight. Before any journey, I find it helps to remind kids what will happen and what's expected of them. Especially the part about having to sit down and wear their seat belt when the light's on. If a child is over three, they'll usually understand. And if they don't, a stern word from the flight attendant will likely scare them straight. Want to earn bonus points? Follow this dad's lead and hand out candies and ear plugs to your fellow travelers. When that plane finally pulls up to the gate after a long night of telling yourself ""this too shall pass,"" there's nothing quite like hearing a departing passenger utter those tear-jerking words of validation: ""Wow, your kids were really well-behaved."" And if they weren't? Who cares. You did your best. More: Do kids and first class mix?","Prince William and Duchess Kate are now on a three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand with Prince George .

"Call it Yelp for moving vans. Unpakt, a comparison site that lets visitors find reputable moving companies and book them online, announced Monday that it's expanding its services, adding the ability to get free, instant price quotes through the site and a tool to help calculate the total cost of a move from various services. ""My goal in founding Unpakt was to bring transparency to the moving industry while taking the hassle out of the booking process for consumers,"" Sharone Ben-Harosh, founder and CEO of Unpakt, said in a media release. Ben-Harosh has worked in the moving industry for more than two decades and started his own company in 1991. Part of Unpakt's mission is to eliminate what he says is a common practice among movers -- quoting a price to customers, then adding fees for what are presented as unanticipated costs. Movers booked through the site agree to a flat rate for a job instead of providing an estimate. Unpakt takes a percentage of the fee for jobs booked through the site. Headquartered in New York City, Unpakt is currently available in 45 states and in over 280 cities. Most recently, the site has added moving companies in Denver, Colorado; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Raleigh, North Carolina; Cheyenne, Wyoming and Davenport, Iowa. With the new Quick Quotes feature, users will get price quotes from Unpakt's pre-approved companies in less than one minute. They can select an offer immediately, locking in the offered price. The Moving Cost Calculator is a widget that can be installed on other websites. It uses the user's basic moving information, like home size and moving address, and then provides three quotes from local moving companies. Unpakt has approved more than 500 moving companies for its site.","Unpakt lets users get instant quotes from moving companies .

"When I was in fourth grade, I wrote Vice President Al Gore a letter about my passion for saving the planet. I was ecstatic when he wrote back. I believed then, as I do now, that he is a strong voice for science and the environment. Since writing that letter as a 10-year-old, I've earned degrees in atmospheric science and environmental engineering. At the same time, I've learned to value the role that science plays in informing public policy. Meanwhile, Al Gore has become the most visible champion of climate science in public life. He famously won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate education, along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists that compiles climate research from around the world. They and other scientists have concluded that human activity -- primarily burning fossil fuels -- puts heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere that makes heat waves more extreme, increases global sea level, and alters historic precipitation patterns. Unfortunately, Vice President Gore took some heat for some comments he made about hurricanes and climate change in an interview with the Washington Post. Initially, the paper misquoted him as saying a new ""Category Six"" was being added to the familiar hurricane scale, which maxes out at Category Five. Category Five storms are those that have sustained winds of more than 157 miles per hour. As Jason Samenow, the paper's weather editor, pointed out, there are no plans by the National Hurricane Center -- the federal office responsible for categorizing storms -- to create a new category. Later though, we found out that Gore merely  indicated that some scientists were ""proposing"" a new category. Although there is no official proposal on the table, in recent years, at least one scientist has publicly stated the scale might need to be changed. For his part, Samenow later retracted the balance of his criticism . This isn't the first time there's been a public back-and-forth over the science linking hurricanes and climate change. Scientific understanding there is still evolving.  And we know that even a sub-Category One storm can be terribly destructive, especially when riding atop rising seas. When discussing science, politicians -- and scientists -- should lead with what we know with more confidence. In the case of climate change, scientists know with great certainty that sea level is rising.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), global average sea level has risen 8 inches over the past century. And new NOAA coastal planning tools show that the United States can expect an additional rise of a foot or more in the next few decades. By the end of the century, scientists find, we can expect 3 feet or more, depending on how much more we overload our atmosphere with carbon. In human terms, that means many places we now call home will face growing risks from encroaching seas, including iconic shore towns and boardwalks and major cities like Miami. In the short term, we know sea-level rise is making every coastal storm, including hurricanes, more damaging and more deadly. The hubbub has also distracted from important points Gore made in the rest of the interview. The rest of Gore's interview was accurate -- and important. He correctly explained that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, the chief heat-trapping gas, continue to rise. Countries, including the United States, are far behind the pledges they made to limit warming. He also pointed out growing support at the local level for dealing with climate change. Communities from Florida to New Jersey are already grappling with how to zone and build and plan in a world of higher temperature and rising seas. Fortunately, there's increasing discomfort with rejections of climate science among the political class. While some supporters of climate policy reform occasionally overstate the effects climate change will have on extreme weather, opponents of climate policy often go completely off the rails, accusing scientists of possible criminal behavior and rejecting the reality of climate change itself. The latter actions are far more damaging to dialogue around climate policy. In fact, they poison our public discourse. You can't deal with a problem if you refuse to acknowledge it exists. The reaction to Gore's words -- scorn from his detractors and defense from his allies -- demonstrates just how broken the discussion has become. Our national discourse around climate change has fallen victim to growing political polarization and the outsize influence of special interests on our democracy. Far too many politicians are scared of even acknowledging climate change. Thankfully, there are some depolarizing voices in the debate, such as former Rep. Bob Inglis, R-South Carolina. He takes the science as a given and is pushing for climate policies that differ from those President Barack Obama recently announced. In other words, he's willing to have a real debate that respects the science. Those are the conversations we deserve, not more public arguments about the science. And I know my fourth-grade-self would agree.","Washington Post corrected report that Al Gore cited creation of Category 6 storms .

"A patient being treated at a Dallas hospital is the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, health officials announced Tuesday. The unidentified man left Liberia on September 19 and arrived in the United States on September 20, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At that time, the individual did not have symptoms. ""But four or five days later,"" he began to exhibit them, Frieden said. The individual was hospitalized and isolated Sunday at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Citing privacy concerns, health officials declined to release any details about how the patient contracted the virus or how he was being treated. ""I can say he is ill. He is under intensive care,"" Dr. Edward Goodman of the hospital told reporters. Frieden declined to answer whether the patient is a U.S. citizen. He also declined to say, clearly, whether the patient is a man, although he referred to the person as ""he"" on multiple occasions. ""The patient was visiting family members and staying with family members who live in this country,"" he said at a news conference. However, the city of Dallas in a news release said the patient ""moved to Dallas from Liberia a week ago."" The patient is believed to have had a handful of contacts with people after showing symptoms of the virus, and before being isolated, Frieden said. A CDC team was en route to Texas to help investigate those contacts, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry will be in Dallas on Wednesday to hold a news conference. Crew members who transported the patient to the hospital have been isolated, the chief of staff for Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNN. None have shown symptoms of the disease so far. The ambulance that carried the patient - ambulance # 37 --- was in use for two days after the transport but was adequately decontaminated, said Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed. ""I do want to stress that the paramedics followed national standards, as they do after each transport, in decontaminating the ambulance,"" she said. ""The Dallas County health department has confirmed that paramedics did follow proper guidelines to avoid contaminating additional patients."" Frieden, too, sought to play down the risk to public health. There are currently no other suspected cases of Ebola in Texas. ""It's a severe disease, which has a high-case fatality rate, even with the best of care, but there are core, tried and true public health interventions that stop it,"" Frieden said. ""The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country,"" he said. According to the CDC, Ebola causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which can affect multiple organ systems in the body and is often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat, each of which can be easily mistaken early on for other ailments like malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Ebola is spread by direct contact with someone sick with the virus. That means people on the patient's flight are not thought to be at risk, as he did not begin to show symptoms until several days after arriving in the United States, Frieden said. He spoke about what's being done at airports to help stop the spread of the disease. ""One of the things that CDC has done in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Lagos, is to work with the airports' authority so 100% of the individuals getting on planes are screened for fever,"" the director said. ""And if they have a fever, they are pulled out of the line, assessed for Ebola and don't fly unless Ebola is ruled out."" He added, however: ""As long as there continue to be cases in West Africa, the reality is that patients travel, individuals travel, and, as appears to have happened in this case, individuals may travel before they have any symptoms."" How the virus spreads . Ebola virus: 9 things to know about the killer disease . A number of other Americans have been diagnosed with the disease in West Africa and then brought to the United States for treatment. The Ebola outbreak has been centered in the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, though there have been concerns about international air travel and other factors -- including the fact the symptoms might not appear until two to 21 days after one is infected -- may contribute to its spread. More than 3,000 people in West Africa have died after being infected with Ebola, according to a World Health Organization report from last week. The same report stated that there had been 6,553 cases of the virus overall, though the number is suspected to be much higher, given difficulties in tracking and reporting the disease. The reason Ebola isn't being stopped . ""I have no doubt that we'll stop this in its tracks in the U.S. But I also have no doubt that as long as the outbreak continues in Africa, we need to be on our guard,"" said Frieden.","Ambulance that transported patient was in service for two more days .

"More than 3,500 pages of previously secret Clinton White House documents made public Friday showed that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Highlights from the Clinton documents . Do your own review with the CNN document reader . Some of the confidential memos, notes and other papers released by the National Archives referred to technological advances of the times, such as the 1995 memo that suggested then first lady Hillary Clinton use the Internet to speak to young women because it ""has become very popular."" Others detailed political battles over health care reform that sounded like today's headlines. ""The Republican alternative, as it appears now to be shaping up, at least among the moderate Republicans in the Senate, is an individual mandate, we have looked at that in every way we know how to,"" said Hillary Clinton's notes from a 1993 meeting with Democratic leaders in Congress. ""That is politically and substantively a much harder sell than the one we've got -- a much harder sell."" Health care wars of old . We now know that the Clinton plan for employers to provide health coverage for workers failed to pass back then, and the individual mandate -- requiring people to obtain health insurance -- is the foundation of the 2010 Obamacare reforms passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress with zero Republican votes. From the same meeting with congressional Democrats, Clinton wrote that ""it may be an unpleasant fact for some of us Democrats to face, but the argument is not going to (be) won on bringing in the uninsured."" President Barack Obama and Democrats now face relentless criticism from Republicans over changes in policies and costs forced on some consumers by the 2010 reforms, rather than the requirement that the previously uninsured get coverage. Clinton's words from two decades ago now sound prescient. ""The argument is going to be won,"" she wrote, on keeping coverage ""for everybody, including those who are insured, but may not be next year or the year after."" In another memo from 1994, an aide to President Bill Clinton warned against using a line in the upcoming State of the Union address about his administration's health care proposal that said: ""You'll pick the health plan and the doctor of your choice."" ""This sounds great and I know that it's just what people want to hear, but can we get away with it?"" wrote White House Staff Secretary Todd Stern. Noting that the thrust of the Clinton reforms was to steer people toward ""cheaper, HMO-style providers,"" Stern added that he worried about ""getting skewered for overpromising here on something we know full well we won't deliver."" Today, Obama gets skewered for similar claims he made during the health care debate 15 years later that turned out to be exaggerated or plain wrong, such as his ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep it"" statement that earned him ""Lie of the Year"" by the fact-checking website PolitiFact. Clinton OK with Obamacare fixes . Hillary Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, faces no apparent bombshells from the 3,546 pages of archival documents made public Friday. Can Clinton tap Obama's magic in South Carolina? It was the first batch of more than 30,000 pages eligible for release after a 12-year waiting period under the Presidential Records Act, with more to be made public in March. First digital age presidential candidate . ""So far, and underlining so far because we're still going through the documents, absolutely nothing"" amounting to a game-changer for Clinton, said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. At the same time, he noted Clinton would be the first presidential candidate of the digital age with still unpublicized documentation dating back to her eight years in the White House as first lady. ""There's never been a candidate that we think we know so well, but yet there's this huge resource of information where we still might learn things,"" King said. The new documents showed a first lady pushed by her aides to be more open and accessible to the public. In the 1995 memo by Press Secretary Lisa Caputo, suggestions included a guest appearance on the ABC TV show ""Home Improvement"" and using the then-young Internet to connect to young women, noting that ""Internet has become a very popular mode of communication."" Four years later, adviser Mandy Grunwald offered ""style pointers"" in a memo for listening tour Clinton did after creating an exploratory committee for her Senate campaign in New York. ""Don't be defensive. Look like you want the questions. The press is obviously watching to see if they can make you uncomfortable or testy. Even on the annoying questions, give relaxed answers,"" Grunwald wrote. She also added that Clinton should ""look for opportunities for humor"" because ""it's important that people see more sides of you, and they often see you only in very stern situations."" Adviser in 1999: Try to be funny . Grunwald also advised Clinton to avoid laying claim on the record of her husband's administration, saying ""this trip is about you, and you are not an incumbent."" One more tip from Grunwald: be prepared to be asked if she ever used drugs. With the potential for politically volatile details in the documents, groups trying to bolster or harm Clinton's possible presidential ambitions made clear they would be having a look. America Rising, a pro-Republican opposition research shop, told CNN that ""we'll be poring through them,"" with a person on ground in Arkansas for that purpose. Rubio on 2016: Clinton would 'struggle' Correct the Record, a pro-Democratic group with deep ties to the Clinton family, also told CNN it would have a team going over the new information. Dem groups already at work for 2016 . Heavy demand appeared to disable the website of the William J. Clinton Presidential Library for some users in the first minutes after the documents were released on Friday afternoon. In total, approximately 25,000 pages of new documents, including confidential communications between President Bill Clinton and his top advisers, will be released over the next two weeks. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, they became eligible for release in January 2013, 12 years after Clinton's presidency ended. ""When those restrictions expired, (the National Archives and Records Administration) then provided notification of our intent to disclose these Presidential records to the representatives of President Obama and former President Clinton in accordance with Executive Order 13489, so that they may conduct a privilege review of the records,"" the National Archives said in a written statement. ""As they complete their review, NARA is able to make the records available."" More documents coming . An additional 8,000 pages are undergoing a further month-long review per a directive from the White House and will not be available for release prior to March 26. The documents in question were part of files that had been requested for public release over the years under the Freedom of Information Act, but were withheld due to their sensitive nature. While the Presidential Records Act established public ownership of White House documents as far back as the Reagan Administration, it defined six categories of records that could be withheld for the 12-year period. They include classified national security information, confidential business information and trade secrets, and unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. Documents pertaining to federal appointments and confidential communications, so-called ""P2"" and ""P5"" exemptions, also fall under the 12-year protection of the act. After the 12-year mark from the end of a presidential administration, the records are subject to the same restrictions as spelled out in the Freedom of Information Act, with one key exception. Congress excluded presidential records from exemptions based on executive privilege. However, since the passage of the law, Presidents Reagan, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have each issued executive orders clarifying the process under which an incumbent president or former president could assert executive privilege to prevent the release of documents. The new releases will not be the first from the Clinton archives. The library routinely releases records in response to FOIA requests, although a sizable backlog exists. Freedom of Information Act requests . Records were also released during the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Kagan, who worked as a White House lawyer during the Clinton administration, and also as a result of ongoing legal action from the conservative group Judicial Watch. Interest in the often unglamorous world of archival research has spiked due to the possible presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York and secretary of state in Obama's first term. Earlier this month, CNN reviewed papers from a former confidante of the Clintons, Diane Blair, that offered some revealing personal glimpses of Hillary Clinton during her years as first lady.

"(CNN)Nursing mother Lauren Modeen has taken to Twitter to ask why Delta Air Lines forced her to check her breast pump. Modeen was boarding Delta Flight 2034 last week traveling from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. It was her second flight of the day for a business trip that would keep her away from her baby for four days. The gate agents wouldn't allow Modeen to board the January 19 flight with her breast pump, which was packed in her standard carry-on suitcase, Modeen said. She also had her purse and a cooler with ice packs to transport her breast milk. Delta and other airlines allow one carry-on bag and one personal item, such as a purse, for free. Medical devices, strollers and certain other equipment are also allowed and don't count against a traveler's carry-on allowance, according to airline policy. The gate agent first told her that she needed to consolidate her luggage, even after Modeen says she told the agent that the suitcase included a medical device. ""She then said the computer just gave her a message stating that all passengers starting with me would need to check their bags,"" Modeen told CNN. ""When I later entered the jet bridge, passengers lining up behind me had their suitcases."" Passenger Peggy Flanagan, who says she doesn't know Modeen, said she saw and heard much of the exchange as she was waiting in line to board the aircraft. ""I saw a young woman who seemed really troubled, and the ticket agent continued to say, 'you can't take it on; you're going to have to check your bag,'"" said Flanagan, executive director of the Children's Defense Fund of Minnesota. ""She kept saying, 'I have a medical device I need to bring with me on the plane,' over and over, visibly upset,"" Flanagan told CNN. ""The ticket agent and her supervisor, who she eventually called over, were not helpful and not supportive."" ""When I got onto the flight, there were at least five available spots in the overhead bins,"" Flanagan said. Even if the flight had been full, Flanagan said, they could have asked for volunteers to check their luggage so Modeen's breast pump could be carried on the flight. ""There was no initiative to help her."" Modeen, who couldn't pump for eight hours, finally picked up her breast pump in her suitcase at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport baggage claim, she said. ""Delta supports the rights of women to breastfeed,"" Delta spokeswoman Lindsay McDuff wrote in an email. ""Breastfeeding and breast pumps are permitted aboard any Delta flight and in Delta ground facilities. We have apologized to the customer for her experience."" Delta's policy on its website, under infant travel, explicitly mentions breast pumps: ""Delta fully supports a woman's right to breast-feed on board Delta and Delta Connection aircraft and in Delta facilities. Breast pumps are allowed on board."" Other U.S. airlines have similar policies. ""Southwest welcomes nursing mothers who wish to breastfeed on the aircraft and/or within our facilities,"" Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Brandy King wrote in an email. ""We do not have restrictions on nursing. Breast pumps are considered a medical device and do not count towards the number of carryon items."" ""When flying on an American Airlines flight, breastfeeding mothers are welcome to do so during all phases of flight,"" American Airlines spokeswoman Brianna Jackson wrote in an email. ""They are welcome to bring breastfeeding equipment on board as it does not count as a carry-on item."" American's policy isn't online, but passengers can call the reservations number to get more information, Jackson said. ""No prohibitions on breastfeeding for us,"" United Airlines spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm wrote in an email. She made no mention of the use of breast pumps on United flights. Modeen says she hopes to increase awareness around women's rights to breastfeed and pump on airlines. With her new Facebook page, Boobs on Board, she wants encourage airlines to post their pro-breastfeeding and breast-pumping policies inside all aircraft. She says she pitched the idea to Susanna Curtis, Delta CEO Richard Anderson's executive assistant, who she says called her to talk about the incident. ""I told her that on behalf of all nursing moms, I would be extremely grateful if this change happened,"" Modeen said. (A Delta spokeswoman didn't comment on that conversation.) Modeen hopes her proposal would encourage airline staff members, increase flying women's awareness of their rights aboard and decrease their anxiety around breastfeeding and pumping aboard, she said. It's not the first time Delta has faced conflict over breastfeeding. In February, a passenger tried to confirm Delta's breastfeeding policy before flying because her child won't drink from bottles or be covered while eating. An official Delta Twitter account suggested that she pump before boarding. Later, the account apologized for incorrectly stating the airline's policy and said she was free to breastfeed.","A Delta passenger claims a gate agent forced her to check her suitcase .
The agent wouldn't budge, even after she was told it contained her breast pump .

"In the wake of Chris Dorner's death, much of the talk has already turned to his political views. In the wake of a tragedy, it is understandable to ask why this happened. It is appropriate to discuss ways to keep it from happening again. But we should draw the line at suddenly giving an exalted place in our national discourse to the political rantings of a murderer. Before he met his end, Dorner took the lives of several human beings and wounded a few more. One of those killed was a father of two. The law enforcement officers killed were simply doing their jobs, trying to keep us safe. San Bernandino County sheriff: 'This investigation is over' Today, with the families of the dead still grieving, it is very hard for me to shift away to focus on Dorner's political views. The families of the victims are still in shock and mourning. Think of their friends and relatives, who are still shocked and devastated. How much would it hurt them if they turned on the TV and heard, instead of tributes to those lost, pundits going on about a crazy man's Facebook manifesto? We should not be ""using this occasion"" to debate various theories of racial justice -- not while the blood of the innocent is still fresh on the ground. Dorner's actions have invalidated his notions of justice; killing innocent people is not the proper method to advance the cause of justice, period. Furthermore, why should any of us participate in giving Dorner exactly what he wanted? We should not validate his quest for attention by discussing his political thinking, especially not while mourning families are  planning funerals. Ex-LAPD cop gains sympathizers on social media . Dorner might have raised intriguing questions on the way to his insane conclusion. But real insights are available elsewhere, from sources that are infinitely more credible. There are many better spokespeople for the cause of racial justice than Dorner. In Los Angeles, there are hundreds of people who have been working to reform the Police Department through legal means, without harming anyone. The people who deserve to be talked about today are the victims of this violence and the people who are trying to make positive change in peaceful, lawful ways. I don't want to reference Dorner in any way except for what he was -- someone who was very disturbed, who needed mental health support and who cruelly took the lives of those devoted to service.","Van Jones: In the wake of Chris Dorner's death, pundits are talking about his political views .

"Barney Frank wasn't the first member of Congress to publicly reveal he was gay, but he was the first to do so voluntarily, he told reporters Tuesday in talking about his decision to retire. Still, Frank said, he didn't come out about his sexuality until he was 47. ""So I was not the daring young man on the flying trapeze, but it worked out better than I thought,"" he said. A prominent 16-term liberal Democrat from Massachusetts and archenemy of political conservatives nationwide, Frank announced Monday that he does not intend to seek re-election in 2012. Now 71, Frank said Tuesday his decision was prompted in part by changes made to the boundaries of his U.S. House district. As part of Massachusetts' recently concluded redistricting process, Frank's 4th Congressional District will lose the heavily Democratic blue-collar port city of New Bedford while gaining several smaller, more conservative towns to bring in more than 300,000 new constituents. ""I decided many years ago I will not be here when I'm 75,"" Frank said, saying that meant the 2012 election would have been his last. ""Everybody has a last term, and if you're talking about people that you've substantially represented, then that's not an obstacle,"" he said. ""But then I would then be required to go to 325,000 people, some of whom I've never represented, and areas I've never been involved in, and say to them, look, here's the deal -- why don't you elect me and for the next two years I will be there to receive your problems and, by the way, by the end of 2014, I'm going to dump them."" President Barack Obama issued a statement praising Frank's public service, calling the congressman a ""fierce advocate for the people of Massachusetts and Americans everywhere who needed a voice."" While Massachusetts' entire House delegation is Democratic, local Republicans insist Frank's retirement will put the reconfigured district in play. ""It is clear that Congressman Frank was not looking forward to another hard-fought campaign after losing his gerrymandered district and spending nearly every penny he had in 2010,"" Massachusetts Republican Party Executive Director Nate Little said in a written statement. ""Republicans were already gearing up for a strong race and Frank's sudden retirement injects added optimism and excitement into the election."" Frank, first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, is the top Democrat on the powerful House Financial Services Committee.  The controversial 2010 Dodd-Frank measure, designed to rein in Wall Street excesses after the 2008 financial collapse, passed the House without any GOP support. Frank made headlines earlier in his career by becoming one of the first openly gay members of Congress. He was formally reprimanded by the House in 1990 for allegations of political impropriety relating to his association with a male prostitute. Frank's current district -- which extends from the affluent, liberal Boston suburbs of Newton and Brookline to the cities of New Bedford and Fall River -- is considered safe Democratic political terrain.  Frank did, however, receive an unusually strong challenge from Republican Sean Bielat in 2010. Frank ultimately defeated Bielat, 54% to 43%.","""It worked out better than I thought,"" Frank says of revealing he is gay .

"(CNN) -- Taylor Swift has another hit on her hands? It must be Tuesday. At midnight, the 24-year-old pop star released a new track cowritten with fun.'s Jack Antonoff called ""Out of the Woods,"" and it's skyrocketed to No. 1. It's the second release from her upcoming album, ""1989,"" and like other Swift songs delves into personal territory. ""This song is about the fragility and breakable nature of some relationships,"" Swift explained to ""Good Morning America"" on Monday, probably prompting speculation as to which of her ex-boyfriends she could be writing about (early buzz points to One Direction's Harry Styles). ""This was a relationship where -- it was kind of (like) living day-to-day, wondering where it was going, if it was going anywhere, if it was going to end the next day,"" Swift recalled. ""It was a relationship where you kind of never feel like you're standing on solid ground. That kind of feeling brings on excitement but also extreme anxiety, and kind of a frantic feeling of wondering. ... This song sounds exactly like that frantic feeling of anxiety and questioning."" We can actually hear Swift's critics rolling their eyes. But here's one of the best things about the star: Even when she's mocked for writing thinly veiled songs about her love life or criticized for going completely pop and not sticking to her country roots, Swift still follows her own path. This is a woman who will tell her record label, when instructed not to venture too far off in a new direction, sorry, ""but this is how it's going to be."" She knows what she wants. She knows who she is. And if you don't like it, she'll just shake off the criticism and write a song about doing so that you secretly won't be able to stop singing. That's pretty gutsy in an industry that's running scared. Here are five other reasons why you can't help but like Taylor Swift, even if you're not a fan: . 1. The catch factor . Have you ever caught yourself singing a catchy ditty and not even remembering how you know the lyrics? It was probably a Taylor Swift track. Her music has a way of permeating every facet of popular culture, to the point that you don't have to buy her albums to recognize the twang from ""You Belong with Me"" or sing the hook from ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together."" 2. Seven Grammys later, still more likely to be found baking with cats . Taylor Swift is one of the most recognizable pop stars on the planet, and we can only imagine the access that kind of fame can yield. We would not be at all surprised if the singer could jet from Milan to Tokyo in the blink of an eye in a private jet with seats lined in mink. But instead of the usual shenanigans you hear about from the very young, privileged and wealthy, Swift is more likely to be found baking cookies or playing with a new kitten. In other words, probably the exact same things she'd be doing if she weren't famous, which is a rare thing to witness. 3. She obsesses over the same TV shows . Speaking of those cats, one of them is named Olivia Benson, as in one of the starring detectives on ""Law & Order: SVU."" Another one of the star's feline friends is named after Meredith Grey on Shonda Rhimes' ""Grey's Anatomy."" Many celebrities claim to be fans of their famous peers work, but Swift appears to be just as obsessed with your favorite TV shows as you are, almost as if she forgot that she, too, is on the A-list. 4. She's BFFs with everyone, including her fans . It's not hard to rattle off Taylor Swift's famous friends, because she has a growing collection that includes everyone from Selena Gomez and Lorde to actresses Jaime King and Lena Dunham. But what makes Swift win over in the skeptics is her connection with her fans. She knows at least one of her supporters so well that she could make a surprise appearance at the fan's bachelorette party with complete ease, posing for pictures and handing over a gift that she knew her fan would like. We'll say that again: She knows her fans well enough that she can buy them personalized presents. Who does that? 5. Her parties are as dorky as yours . While some stars are always sharing photos of their exclusive vacations in exotic faraway locales, Swift's get-togethers look like they could've been photographed in your neighbor's backyard. Fourth of July? She's baking a holiday-themed cake and hitting the Slip N' Slide. Christmas season? She's constructing homemade holiday cards with actress Hailee Steinfeld. And of course, as endlessly chronicled on Twitter, you know Swift will always dance like no one's watching. Always.","Taylor Swift released a new song at midnight Tuesday .

"(CNN)Hipsters, rejoice. Next time you ride your fixed-gear bicycle to the the thrift store, where you find a vintage, grease-stained mechanic's shirt that matches your Rollie Fingers mustache and Grizzly Adams beard, there's an edgy, if technologically sub-optimal, way to tell your friends about it. Use a flip phone. In an age of the iPhone 6 Plus and massive Android phablets, flip phones are inexplicably making a comeback. No less an arbiter of cool than Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour has apparently dumped her iPhone in favor of a flipper. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, actress Kate Beckinsale and even Rihanna are just a few of the celebrities spotted proudly brandishing the famous piece of paleo-technology. And, believe it or not, ""dumb phones"" aren't exactly the elusive unicorn that some of us think they are. As of January, 56% of American adults owned smartphones, compared to a total of 90% who had a cellphone of some kind, according to the Pew Research Internet Project. Among millennials age 18-29, an overwhelming 83% of those who owned cellphones had a smartphone, but that leaves the other 17% who keep their mobile life more basic. The hinged, snap-shut ""flipper"" form factor was originally introduced to the public in 1982 by laptop manufacturer GriD with its Compass computer. Motorola, perhaps the king of flip phones with its Razr line, introduced the clamshell style in 1996 with its StarTAC phone (which, appropriately enough, was re-released for nostalgic techies in 2010). Is this really all about going for retro, hipster street cred? There is, at times, a mystifying aspect of ""cool"" that centers around eschewing modern convenience for vintage ... well ... inconvenience. Writing on typewriters? Check. Racing high-wheel bicycles from the 1880s? Yes. Playing baseball with the rules and equipment of the 1860s? Absolutely. But there are obviously some more practical reasons some people, including millennials, go flip. For some, it's about simplifying and uncluttering in a 24/7 plugged-in society. ""It just seemed like it would be better for my addled brain than a smartphone,"" 26-year-old Angelica Baker, a tutor and writer, told TIME. ""Personally I'm too scattered and unfocused to handle email and Facebook on my phone."" Baker swapped out her Droid for her mom's retired flip phone, a pink Motorola Razr. No one has to worry about the iCloud being hacked when they use a flip phone. There's little to no eye and neck strain. No fear of Flappy Bird addiction. And, let's be honest ... there's something satisfying about a switchblade-like phone flip after an annoying phone conversation that even the most emphatic tap of a touchscreen will never approach. Maybe the hipsters are onto something after all. Though we'll still pass on the bushy beards.","Among the young and hip, flip phones are making a comeback .

"Humans have reached the moon and are planning to return samples from Mars, but when it comes to exploring the land deep beneath our feet, we have only scratched the surface of our planet. This may be about to change with a $1 billion mission to drill 6 km (3.7 miles) beneath the seafloor to reach the Earth's mantle -- a 3000 km-thick layer of slowly deforming rock between the crust and the core which makes up the majority of our planet -- and bring back the first ever fresh samples. It could help answer some of our biggest questions about the origins and evolution of Earth itself, with almost all of the sea floor and continents that make up the Earth´s surface originating from the mantle. Geologists involved in the project are already comparing it to the Apollo Moon missions in terms of the value of the samples it could yield. However, in order to reach those samples, the team of international scientists must first find a way to grind their way through ultra-hard rocks with 10 km-long (6.2 miles) drill pipes -- a technical challenge that one of the project co-leaders Damon Teagle, from the UK's University of Southampton calls, ""the most challenging endeavor in the history of Earth science."" 'A ship flying in space:' Earth seen through the eyes of an astronaut . Their task will be all the more difficult for being conducted out in the middle of the ocean. It is here that the Earth´s crust is at its thinnest at around 6 km compared to as much as 60 km (37.3 miles) on land. They have already identified three possible locations -- all in the Pacific Ocean -- where the ocean floor was formed at relatively fast spreading mid-ocean ridges, says Teagle. The hole they will drill will be just 30 cm in width all the way from the ocean floor to inside the mantle -- a monumental engineering feat. ""It will be the equivalent of dangling a steel string the width of a human hair in the deep end of a swimming pool and inserting it into a thimble 1/10 mm wide on the bottom, and then drilling a few meters into the foundations,"" says Teagle. To get to the mantle scientists will be relying on a purpose-built Japanese deep-sea drilling vessel called Chikyu, first launched in 2002 and capable of carrying 10 km of drilling pipes. It has already set a world-record for the deepest hole in scientific ocean drilling history, reaching 2.2 km into the seafloor. Read more: Super telescope to search for secrets of the universe . What makes the task even more difficult is that, currently, the drill bits have a limited lifespan of between 50-60 hours before needing to be replaced, meaning drilling could take many years unless technology improves. The first attempts to reach the Earth's mantle actually began back in the early 1960s. Dubbed ""Project Mohole"" after the Croatian meteorologist Andrija Mohorovicic who first discovered the boundary between the Earth's crust and mantle, a team of U.S. scientists managed to drill a few meters into the oceanic crust off Guadalupe Island in the eastern pacific. The achievement was recognized by a telegram from President John F. Kennedy but the project was closed down in 1966. Since then, a Russian-project in the far north Kola Peninsula during the 1980s has taken over the record for the deepest borehole ever drilled, reaching 12 km into the earth's crust. And In 2011, the oil giant Exxon Mobil recorded an even longer borehole at just over 12 km in eastern Russia. However, it wasn't drilled vertically downwards and only reached soft sedimentary rocks. While neither of these record-drilling projects got close to the Earth's mantle, they did give the geologists leading the new project -- The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) -- confidence that recent advances in drilling techniques have made their plans more feasible than ever before. What we've done on Mars, and what's next . ""Many of the technologies required are conventional deep-drilling technologies that are presently being used in the oil and gas industry,"" explain IODP geologists. However, given the challenges and the likely cost of $1 billion plus, much of which still needs to be raised, skeptics may question the necessity of the mission. For Teagle, reaching the Earth's mantle would provide a ""legacy of fundamental scientific knowledge"" and ""inspire"" future generations. ""I was giving a lecture to a group of 15-year-old high-school students recently and they [and their teachers] were fascinated by the technology and the thought that we could re-enter a hole just a few centimeters across with a drill string dangled from a ship in the open ocean 4 km above."" As well as the technical achievement of bringing back samples, the samples themselves will clarify many of the assumptions we have about how our planet works. Despite making up 68% of the Earth´s mass, Teagle says we only have a ""reasonable"" idea of what the mantle is made of and how it works. ""[The mantle] is the engine that drives how our planet works and why we have earthquakes and volcanoes and continents. We have the textbook cartoons but detailed knowledge is lacking,"" he says. The Japanese government has already invested substantially in the project through the construction of Chikyu, with some scientists regarding the mission as the country's ""moon project."" If Japanese support can be combined with other funding, Teagle says they could start drilling before the end of the decade, making it possible for humans to finally reach the Earth's mantle by the early 2020s. Deepest cracks of Earth give clues to life in space .","Scientists planning mission to drill down to Earth's mantle and bring back first fresh samples .

"The Obama administration will give more time to people who try to apply for health insurance coverage through the federal marketplace by Monday but encounter difficulty, administration officials said Tuesday evening. Monday is the deadline for people to enroll in order to have coverage for this year or face penalties under the Affordable Care Act. ""Open enrollment ends March 31. We are experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment -- either online or over the phone,"" said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. Administration officials said this move, similar to the one in December for the large number of people who were trying to sign up by January 1, will accommodate people who face special circumstances or complex cases and need extra time to complete their enrollment. The officials said those who fall in this category will have to attest to their circumstances as part of the application process. They refused to say how much more time these people will get to finish enrollment and still qualify for coverage this year. The Affordable Care Act wants you . The Washington Post, which first reported the enactment of the new flexibility, said applicants would have until mid-April. Specific details could be released as early as Wednesday. CNN last week reported the administration was considering this action. In an answer to a question from CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta on Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney indicated the administration would allow some flexibility for those who encountered problems meeting Monday's deadline. ""As was the case for the December deadline, we're going to want to make sure that people who are already in line can finish their enrollment,"" Carney said. Insurance industry sources did not want to comment in detail until they knew of the specifics but said anytime changes are made, it complicates their work and will require manual workarounds to help complete applications. They said so long as the time period is limited, they can accept it. Republicans Tuesday evening criticized the move by the administration. ""Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won't work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats' failed health care law,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. The White House is trying to meet a goal of enrolling 6 million people. As of mid-March, 5 million had enrolled. The administration has been engaged in an exhaustive effort to not only enroll as many people as possible but also to increase the percentage of young adults who apply to help balance the makeup of those insured. The administration said it has recently seen a major increase in traffic to HeatlhCare.gov. On Monday the site logged  1.1 million visitors, its second-busiest traffic day.

"Fast food workers striking for higher wages in seven cities Monday are bound to be disappointed. On their last week before vacation, Congress isn't likely to raise the minimum wage. They're not even close to critical mass on that issue. With other issues on their plate -- immigration reform, the farm bill and that whole business about funding the government -- it is not one of the things lawmakers are spending a lot of time talking about. There aren't any votes scheduled any time soon and it hasn't yet had a hearing in the House of Representatives this year. But there does seem to be a confluence of minimum wage story lines, in addition to the fast food walkout, across the nation recently. Related: Fast food workers protest in seven cities . In a major speech last week, President Barack Obama renewed his call to up the current $7.25 minimum wage for wage earners who don't get tips to $9.00 per hour. The minimum wage section was an applause line when he spruced up his economic plan with the first in a series of speeches he plans to give outside of Washington. ""Because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office.  It's time for the minimum wage to go up,"" he said during his speech at Knox College in central Illinois. He also called for a minimum wage increase in more detail during his State of the Union address earlier this year. ""This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families,"" he said. ""It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government. In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher."" In Washington, the City Council passed a bill this month that would force large retailers -- specifically, Walmart -- to pay a wage of more than $12.00. That's a higher hourly rate than some D.C. city workers get. Supporters of the bill counter that city workers get benefits that bring their compensation above $12.50 -- not everyone at Walmart does. There's still no word on when that bill will head to Washington Mayor Vincent Gray for his expected veto. Related: Walmart vs. D.C. Lawmakers . The current federally-mandated minimum wage is $7.25 -- the same as it has been for the past four years. A family with children living on one or even two full-time minimum wage salaries could still fall below the federal poverty line, depending on the cost of living in their hometown. In recent years there has been a push for the minimum wage to be a ""living"" wage. That would require a drastic uptick, however. According to a ""living wage"" calculator from MIT,  a ""living wage"" for an adult and a child in Cincinnati, Ohio, for instance, would be $17.56, if you factor in child care. For two adults and no children, they suggest a living wage of $16.20 per hour if there were no child care expenses. Every Republican and six Democrats in the House voted against raising the minimum wage when Democrats offered it during a procedural fight over an unrelated bill in March. That vote was 223-184. The federal rate has only been raised a few times in recent decades, most recently in 2007, soon after Democrats took control of the House. They lost control of the House in 2010. The third and final in a series bumps from that legislation kicked in in 2009. Those who support increasing the minimum wage want to tie it to inflation and initiate automatic cost of living adjustments at periodic intervals. As it stands, only Congress can raise the minimum wage. And those efforts traditionally take a long time. It took 10 years between a 1997 wage hike and the one enacted in 2007. States and cities, meanwhile, have worked on their own solutions. They've tied minimum wage to inflation in two states including Oregon, where the rate is approaching $9. Some cities are even higher. The minimum wage in high-cost San Francisco is $10.55. Eighteen states and the District of Colombia have a minimum wage higher than the federal level of $7.25, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. There is evidence on both sides of the minimum wage debate. Proponents of an increase say it is an important safeguard for low-wage workers and evidence shows it does not lead to higher unemployment. But opponents suggest is has other effects on the jobs market. Raising the minimum wage ""makes it harder for unskilled workers to gain the labor market experience and on-the-job training that would raise their productivity and future pay,"" wrote the economist Stephen Bronars, of Welch Consulting  and a professor at Georgetown recently. ""Unskilled workers are less attractive with a higher minimum wage because they produce less per hour and their hiring diverts more senior workers from revenue producing activities to training and supervision."" According to a recent CNN Money report on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, minimum wage jobs are on the decline. An estimated 3.6 million people were paid hourly rates at or below the federal minimum in 2012. Nearly 60% of U.S. workers are paid hourly, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. An estimated 4.7% of those hourly workers make minimum wage or less, down from 5.2%, a year earlier -- the lowest rate since 2008.","Little chance Congress with take up increasing the minimum wage any time soon .
Obama has said he wants to raise rate from $7.25/hour to $9.00/hour.

"Only 10% of countries carried out executions last year, but those employing the death penalty are doing so at an alarming rate, a new report says. According to Amnesty International's annual review of death sentences and executions, the number of countries using capital punishment in 2011 was 20, a decrease of more than a third compared to 10 years ago. Some 18,750 people faced death sentences at the end of 2011, while at least 676 people were executed across the world, the report said. People were sentenced to death for a range of offenses including adultery and sodomy in Iran, blasphemy in Pakistan and drug offenses in around 10 countries. Amnesty claims many of these cases would not have involved fair trials by international standards, and that ""confessions"" are often extracted through the use of torture and other methods of coercion. ""The vast majority of countries have moved away from using the death penalty,"" said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. ""Our message to the leaders of the isolated minority of countries that continue to execute is clear: you are out of step with the rest of the world on this issue and it is time you took steps to end this most cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. "" Countries in the Middle East recorded a steep rise in executions last year -- 50% up compared to the previous year -- with Saudi Arabia (estimated to be 82), Iran (at least 360), Yemen (at least 41) and Iraq (at least 68) responsible for 99% of all recorded cases in the region.  Amnesty added that the true extent of Iran's record was unknown due to a lack of credible official figures. Likewise the report did not include what it described were ""the thousands of executions that Amnesty International believes were carried out in China, where the numbers are suppressed."" It claimed thousands of people were executed in China in 2011, more than the rest of the world put together. The rights group says it has stopped publishing figures it collects from public sources in China, as ""these are likely to grossly underestimate the true number."" Chinese authorities could not be immediately reached for comment. Meanwhile, the United States was the only member of the G8 group of leading economies to execute prisoners -- 43 in 2011, the report said. Europe and former Soviet countries were ""capital punishment-free,"" apart from Belarus where two people were executed last year. ""Even among the small group of countries that executed in 2011, we can see gradual progress,"" Shetty added. ""It is not going to happen overnight but we are determined that we will see the day when the death penalty is consigned to history.""","Some 18,750 people faced death sentences in 2011, while at least 676 people were executed .

"(CNN) -- A driverless taxi is waiting for you outside your house. Cruising through the city, you arrive safely at the airport where you drop off your luggage while ordering a coffee. Check-in is then a matter of just a few seconds, thanks to facial recognition software, while distant biometric scanning allows you to avoid long security queues. Walking past interactive shopping windows, yoga studios and outdoor green terraces, you arrive at the departure hall, a bright uplifting space dotted with paintings by the French impressionist masters. After having a look around, holographic airport staff guide you to your boarding gate. You soon find yourself aboard sitting in your body morphing seat that is fully-equipped with all the movies from your favorite director. No, this is not science fiction. Instead, this is how your airport travel experience will be in just 10 years from now-- according to Skyscanner. The travel booking site released Monday the second part of its ""Future of Travel"" report which looks at what travel journeys will look like in 2024. Compiled by a team of 56 experts and futurologists from the travel and tech industries, the study predicts that future travel journey ""will be almost unrecognizable from the often time consuming and stressful experience of 2014."" Read this: This plane can 'fly forever' In 10 years' time airports will be intelligent spaces that will allow travelers to enjoy an automated and stress free journey. Emerging technologies will transform airlines into virtual hubs where passengers will be able to create their own havens to suit their personal preferences. ""Airports and flights will no longer be the price we pay to travel but instead will signify the start of our holidays where travelers can relax and create the perfect space to suit their needs whether they're flying for business or leisure,"" says Filip Filipov, Skyscanner's Head of B2B. Here, based on Skyscanner's predictions, CNN's On The Move presents the top three things you can expect to experience at the airport and while flying in 2024. 1. Self-service check-in, scanning sensors and digital bag tags . Future travelers will take complete control of their journey, which will be free of check-in desks and long queues. Biometric check-in software will eliminate the need for boarding passes and passport checks, while X-ray machines will also become a thing of the past thanks to sensors capable of scanning big groups from a large distance. Digital luggage tags pre-set with flight details and destination information will allow passengers to track their bags in real time throughout their trip. ""You'd be able to see where your bag is at all time,"" says Filipov, ""and when it is arriving."" 2. Art, yoga and waterfalls . Once past security, out go the blunt and dull and in come the cool and splendor. The soulless departure lounges and mundane transit areas of today will be replaced by uplifting, comfortable lounges filled with paintings and sculptures. If you don't feel like delving into the world of art, amenities ranging from rooftop swimming pools and 3D cinemas to gyms and open-air parks will offer a pleasant distraction before boarding your flight. Similarly, virtual shopping walls will replace duty free stores, with passengers able to order goods with a simple verbal command. ""You will be able to select the goods that you'd like to buy and have them delivered to your home potentially when you're back from vacation,"" says Filipov. 3. 'Your home in the air' In cabin smart lighting will make jetlag a thing of the past, while seats that mold to the passengers' body shape will come with pre-loaded films and music according to their tastes. A mix between a mobile living room and a virtual office, the seating will also allow travelers to hold 3D chats with their family, friends or business contacts through Skype hologram systems. ""That seat will become your home, in a way, in the air,"" says Filipov. ""It will actually be tailored to you, not in terms of how it looks and how it feels but rather the multimedia that goes with it.""

"The leadership of Boko Haram must think they have hit the jackpot. The abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in northeast Nigeria has been denounced by U.S. President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. That has given them all the publicity they crave. Their movement is now the top item on all global news channels. If, as I suspect, Boko Haram sees itself as a suicide mission to inspire all Muslims to follow them and wage war on the West, they must feel their hour has come. The final battle is about to begin. Bornu state Nigeria is one of the poorest, most neglected parts of the planet. Until recently I would have said the only surplus in that part of Nigeria was its long-suffering Islamic resignation. Now that has turned to anger. And this remote, dry, dusty corner of Nigeria, a place you would only visit on your way to the Sahara Desert, has become the new battleground between militant Islam and the Western world. How? The answer lies in a very telling comment from John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State. The U.S. had, he said repeatedly offered help to Nigeria but it was ignored. Ignored. That is exactly what the Nigerian government's attitude has been to the northeast for decades -- and to the Boko Haram terrorists until they hit Abuja, the capital. Then there was an attempt to clamp down but the security extended there never reached Maidugri, the capital of Bornu state in the northeast and some 500 miles away from Abuja, the capital, and another 320 miles from Lagos, the commercial megacity of West Africa. So it doesn't matter. Just as the kidnapping of more than 200 girls did not elicit any statement from President Goodluck Jonathan until more than two weeks after it happened. Nor do the levels of poverty, unemployment, lack of education and health services and a fast-growing population in the northeast matter to the government of Nigeria. Its income derives from Western oil companies so the government has little democratic relationship with the people of Nigeria. Sixty per cent live in poverty. Boko Haram began as a fundamentalist but not particularly violent movement in 2002. The killing of its leader, Mohammed Yusuf, while in police custody inspired its members to take up arms against the state. Nigerian police said Yusuf had been shot while trying to escape, but other reports said he had been summarily executed. The police force, which in normal times just collects ""personal fines"" from motorists and others for minor transgressions, is too corrupt to protect anyone. Meanwhile the army, trained to fight a conventional war, went in heavily and terrified rather than protected the population. On this day last year Boko Haram attacked a barracks, a prison and a police post in the town of Bama. The military said the group killed 55 people and freed 105 prisoners. Nigeria is used to uprisings. A few years ago the Niger Delta which produces Nigeria's immense oil wealth, was in flames. Gangs of youths with heavy machine guns killed their rivals and kidnapped oil workers for cash. They too played on the neglect of the local population which could see billions of dollars-worth of oil being sucked out from under their feet while not a single road was being built. The government of Goodluck Jonathan -- himself from the Delta -- now administers an amnesty program under which former militants receive payments to give up their arms. Many of the militants were given jobs in the government and swapped their tee-shirts and bandanas for sharp suits and ties. But there is no such incentive to develop Bornu state. It produces nothing and will not vote for President Jonathan. Unless there is a major political upset, he will serve another four-year term after elections in February next year. The big challenge in Nigeria for the U.S. military and intelligence services is this: if they limit their intervention purely to tracking down and releasing the girls and killing or capturing their Boko Haram kidnappers, they will have a brief success followed by long term failure. No movement like Boko Haram can exist for long without some, at least tacit, support of the local people. And the local people have little to thank the government for. I was on the beach at Mogadishu in 1992 when the Navy Seals stormed ashore followed by waves of Marines. For a few weeks Somalia was quite peaceful, mission accomplished was the message. We wrote positive stories about the restoration of Somalia. The war has continued to this day. Two years later I followed the U.S. Marines into Kuwait and then into Iraq in the first Gulf War. Problem solved, it seemed. And I worked in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s where the British army was always claiming to be on the brink of defeating the IRA. That very attitude simply strengthened them. Have the lessons from Iraq, Afghanistan, Northern Ireland been learned? Military intervention is tough but easy compared with the long haul of development which must accompany it. The Kanuri people of northeast Nigeria need robust protection, peace and security in the short term but they also need education, health services and livelihoods in the long term. They need to know that the Nigerian government and its American supporters are on their side. Can America provide that? Or will we see a magnificent charge, lots of shoot-outs and arrests followed by a declaration of peace, the departure of the army and then an even worse uprising two years hence? The biggest challenge facing Obama and the Americans is the failure of President Goodluck Jonathan to focus on the problems of northeast Nigeria. Together they need to make a long term plan to bring investment to the area, provide health and education services and build institutions. Above all make the people there feel they are part of this booming new Nigerian economy which recently became the biggest in Africa.

"When you're running low on toilet paper and getting desperate, what do you do? If you're the Venezuelan government, you take over a toilet paper factory. On Saturday, Vice President Jorge Arreaza announced the ""temporary occupation"" of the Paper Manufacturing Company's plant in the state of Aragua. The aim, he explained, is to review the ""production, marketing and distribution (of) toilet paper."" ""The ... People's Defense from the Economy will not allow hoarding or failures in the production and distribution of essential commodities,"" the vice president said. By the ""People's Defense,"" Arreaza was referring to a government agency created on September 13 by President Nicolas Maduro to ""defeat the economic war that has been declared in the country,"" according to a report from state-run ATV. This group is charged with looking at inefficiencies across various industries in the nation, including foods and other products, and taking action presumably in the South American nation's best interests. Toilet paper is very much a part of the war. The bathroom essential is one of the basic goods and foodstuffs that have been disappearing from store shelves since earlier this year. In Caracas, for instance, long lines are common whenever new rolls come in. As the amount of TP and other products, such as rice and cooking oil, have lagged, the blame game has picked up. Businesses and the political opposition say the shortages stem from ill-conceived government policies such as price controls on basic goods and tight restrictions on foreign currency. These moves make it so many producers can't even break even, they say. But the government has said private companies aren't doing their part, accusing them of hoarding their products in hopes of selling it later at a higher price. They've also suggested the problem is tied to a broader conspiracy. ""There is no deficiency in production,"" Commerce Minister Alejandro Fleming said in May according to ATV, ""but an excessive demand generating purchases by a nervous population because of a media campaign."" At that time, Fleming announced the country would import 50 million rolls of toilet paper to meet demand. Other hygiene products, such as toothpaste and soap, may be similarly brought in bulk for the same reason, the minister said.

"We Americans are disgusted with our government. We ranked fixing ""corruption in Washington"" number 2 on Gallup's poll of top presidential priorities in 2012.  Yet Washington doesn't seem to care. Neither President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney even mentioned ""corruption"" as an issue that their administration would address. And it will take a lot more work by us to get them to pay attention. The first step, however, is to figure out how best to talk about the problem. People say the problem is ""money in politics."" That we need to ""get money out."" That ""money is not speech."" That ""corporations are not people."" These are slogans, and they're quite effective at rallying at least some of us to the cause. But as slogans, they're likely to turn off most to the right of America's center. And in any case, they don't quite capture what's gone wrong with our political system today. They therefore don't point us to a plausible solution to the problem of our political system today. So in my TED talk, I created Lesterland: Imagine a country like the United States, with just as many ""Lesters"" as the United States (about 150,000 out of a population of more than 300 million, or about 0.05%). And imagine those Lesters have a very special power: Each election cycle has two elections. In one, the general election, all citizens get to vote. In the other, the ""Lester election,"" only ""Lesters"" get to vote. But here's the catch: To be allowed to run in the general election, you must do extremely well in the Lester election. You don't necessarily need to win, but you must do extremely well. TED.com: Why democracy matters . We all get what Lesterland would be like. Sure, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United, ""the People"" of Lesterland would have the ""ultimate influence"" over elected officials. Ultimate, because in the final election, the people get to vote. But ""the People"" only get to vote for the candidates who have made ""the Lesters"" happy. And no doubt, that fact will produce a subtle, understated, somewhat camouflaged bending to keep those Lesters happy. Once you see Lesterland, and the corruption it creates you understand USA-land, and the corruption we suffer. For the United States is Lesterland. Like Lesterland, the United States also has two elections. One a voting election, where citizens get to select the candidates who will ultimately govern. But the other is a money election, where the candidates who wish to run in the voting election raise the money they need to compete. As in Lesterland, the candidates don't necessarily need to win the money election. But they must do extremely well. And here's the stunning fact that links the United States to Lesterland: there are just as few ""relevant funders"" in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland. TED.com: A Plan B for the Internet . Less than 0.05% of us — about 150,000 Americans — give enough money to be even noticed by the candidates desperate to fund their campaigns. Even that number is likely an exaggeration. The better number is probably closer to 50,000 Americans (just about the number of ""Sheldons"" in America) (Really) Now that fact alone — that we fund campaigns from a tiny slice of us — doesn't necessarily create the corruption that is our Congress. What does that is how the money is raised from that tiny slice of us. For members of Congress and candidates for Congress spend anywhere between 30% and 70% of their time raising money from this tiny, tiny slice of us. Think of a rat in a Skinner box, learning which buttons to push to get pellets of food, and you have a pretty good sense of the life of a congressman: a constant attention to what must be done to raise money, and to raise money not from all of us, but from the tiniest slice of the 1% of us. And so what issues might that tiny, tiny slice of the 1% care about? Unemployment? Out-of-control health care costs? Actually reforming Wall Street? Obviously not. The issues that matter to this tiny fraction of the 1% are not the issues that matter to America. This is the corruption of USA-land. And it will only ever change if we change the way we fund elections. TED.com: Lawrence Lessig on laws that choke creativity . Members of Congress will always be dependent upon their funders. But if we adopted a system to fund campaigns like the one proposed by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, The Grassroots Democracy Act, then ""the funders"" would be ""the People."" If members raised the funds they needed from small contributions only, then many more of us would be the ""relevant funders."" And thus when members were responsive to their ""funders,"" they would thus be responsive to that many more of us. That, after all, was the Framers' original design. James Madison promised us a Congress ""dependent upon the people alone."" ""Alone."" We've got instead a Congress dependent upon the people and dependent upon the Lesters. We need to find a way back to Madison's original design, so that we can find a way to restore again a government that works. Leaving Lesterland is the critical first step. Congress could do that tomorrow.","Lawrence Lessig: America's democracy is hobbled by the power of money in politics .
A tiny slice of Americans provide funds that largely determine who wins primaries, he says .

"Creativity, the ability to see things differently and come up with new breakthroughs, isn't some God-given gift to be enjoyed by the lucky few. It's a natural part of human behavior. Unfortunately, sometimes creativity gets blocked and we lose confidence in our own ability to create. Albert Bandura is one of the great psychologists: Only Freud, Skinner and Piaget have been cited more. Bandura is 86 now and he still works at Stanford. One day we met on campus and got to talking about this methodology he'd developed to cure phobias, called ""guided mastery."" I mean, Bandura's methodology didn't just cure people with a lifelong fear of snakes; it affected other parts of their lives. Watch David Kelley's TED Talk: How to build your creative confidence . First Bandura would invite the person with the fear of snakes into a room and say, ""You know, there's a snake in the next room and we're going in there."" To which they usually responded, ""Hell no, I'm not."" Then he'd have the person stand in front of a two-way mirror looking into the room where a friend of theirs was holding a snake. Gradually, the person would start to feel more comfortable. Many small steps later, eventually they wouldn't just be in standing in the same room as a snake, they'd be wearing leather gloves, getting ready to actually touch one. And as soon as someone with a phobia of snakes actually touched a snake in that room, they were fine. Better than fine. TED.com: Elizabeth Gilbert on nurturing creativity . In fact, the people who had touched the snake ended up having less anxiety and more success elsewhere in their lives. They tried harder, they persevered longer, and they were more resilient in the face of failure. They had gained a new confidence in their ability to attain what they set out to do. Bandura calls that confidence ""self-efficacy,"" and it could possibly change the world, one person at a time. Well, meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me, because I realized that this famous scientist had scientifically validated something we'd been seeing for the last 30 years. At IDEO and the d.school (Stanford's school of design), we meet people from all kinds of businesses. A lot of these highly skilled people have spent years honing their analytical, practical mind -- but they can't remember the last time they created something new. They say things like, ""I'm afraid I'm just not the creative type."" We've found that we can help people regain their creative confidence through a series of small successes that take fear and turn it into familiarity. Even better, when people regain this creative confidence -- and we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO -- we've found that they start working on the things that are really important in their lives. They go in new directions. They come up with more interesting, more prolific ideas, so they can choose from better options. And they make better decisions. TED.com: Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity . To me, that journey to creative confidence looks like Doug Dietz. Doug Dietz is a technical person. He designs life-saving, award-winning medical imaging equipment, MRI machines, and he's had a fantastic career at GE. But at one point Doug had a moment of crisis. He had come to a hospital to observe one of his MRI machines in use and met a young family whose little girl was so terrified of the MRI that she had to be sedated before getting a scan. Then Doug found out she wasn't the only one. Nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with the scary MRI machine. Around that time he was taking classes at the d.school, learning about design thinking, about empathy, about iterative prototyping. And he decided to take his new creative confidence and do something quite extraordinary. He decided to redesign the entire experience of being scanned. He painted the walls and he painted the machine, and he had children's museum people retrain the operators, and he turned the MRI experience into an adventure story for kids. Now when a kid comes in, they're in a story, not a machine. The operators say things like, ""Okay, you're going to go into the pirate ship, but be very still because we don't want the pirates to find you."" Because of Doug's MRI redesign, this pediatric ward went from 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated, to something like 10 percent. The hospital and GE were happy too, because less anesthesiologist time meant more patients could finish in one day. So the quantitative results were great. But the results that Doug cared about were much more qualitative: He was waiting with a young family one day when a little girl came out of her scan, ran up to her mother, and said, ""Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"" TED.com: 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do . Doug's story takes place in a hospital. I know a thing or two about hospitals, too. A few years ago I felt a lump on the side of my neck, and it was my turn in the MRI machine. It was cancer. I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival. So while you're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody's pale and thin and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays, you think about a lot of things. Mostly you think about, ""Am I going to survive?"" But you think about other things, too, like, ""What was I put on Earth to do?"" At this point I knew that if I survived, my purpose was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way. So I hope you'll join me on my quest. Let's not let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing. Let's help people realize that they're naturally creative, and they should let their ideas fly. Achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy. Find the belief that you can do what you set out to do. Believe that you can reach a place of creative confidence. Touch the snake.

"A major international environmental group is pulling out of the process to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones, saying the Kimberley Process had refused ""to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds, violence and tyranny."" The campaign group, Global Witness, had been part of the process to certify that precious stones are not ""blood diamonds"" for nine years. Mike Davis announced  the Global Witness decision Monday. ""We don't take this decision lightly, but we feel that we've now have reached a juncture where by continuing to participate we are inadvertently lending legitimacy to a scheme which is really misleading people in the diamond trade,"" he said. The decision follows the controversial sale of a batch of diamonds from the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe, some of which are owned by companies associated with President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. Davis said the Mugabe government has to rely on diamond income because of the intense international pressure on it. ""Diamonds are an absolute godsend for them and a curse for the rest of Zimbabwe,"" he said. The Kimberley Process was developed in 2000 when a group of diamond-producing countries met in Kimberley, South Africa, to combat the trade in conflict diamonds. The group's efforts were supported by the United Nations, which in December of 2000, ratified a resolution in support of the group.","Global Witness says the scheme is ignoring the links between diamonds, violence and tyranny .

"North Korea, China's longtime ally, has vexed Beijing for years with its rocket launches, nuclear tests, kidnapping of Chinese fishermen and other erratic behavior. Yet, Beijing has run interference at the United Nations to temper punishments against Pyongyang, and has even helped Pyongyang circumvent sanctions. In the wake of North Korea's third nuclear test in February, its reckless threats to strike the United States, and now -- its decision to scrap the armistice that ended the Korean War -- has China finally had enough? Beijing signed on to sanctions that, in the words of Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will ""bite and bite hard."" China's ambassador to the U.N. declared Beijing's commitment to ""safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula."" One shouldn't exaggerate the significance of these recent developments. After all, in the U.N. negotiations over sanctions -- this time as before -- the Chinese have consistently played the role of watering down the degree of punishment imposed against Pyongyang. And in the past Chinese firms have helped North Koreans evade sanctions. It remains to be seen whether Beijing intends to enforce the new measures. As rhetoric heats up, North Koreans ready to 'rain bullets on the enemy' Beijing also has good reasons that continue to make it reluctant to crack down on its unruly ally. The Chinese perceive that they have a powerful interest in maintaining the status quo. As hard as it is to live with North Korea, Beijing fears it may be harder to live without it. The Chinese worry that coming down hard on Pyongyang, by cutting off their vital oil or food exports, could trigger a collapse of the North Korean government or other political instability on the peninsula. Beijing's nightmares include a loose nukes problem and a humanitarian disaster. Beijing also has fears about the effects of a North Korean collapse on the strategic balance in East Asia. If North Korea collapsed and the two Koreas unified, China might find astride its border a unified, U.S.-aligned Korea hosting American troops. Chinese analysts also commonly argue that North Korea serves as an important distraction for the U.S. military, which might otherwise train its focus on defending Taiwan. Thus, despite the nuisance that North Korea regularly makes of itself, for all these reasons, it would be sorely missed by Beijing. North Korea declares 1953 armistice invalid . But the days of ""lips and teeth"" (Mao Zedong's's famous statement about the closeness of Sino-North Korean relations) are clearly over. Chinese scholars and analysts increasingly express open frustration with Pyongyang's behavior. In the wake of North Korean piracy against Chinese fishermen, Chinese microblogs overflowed with outrage. Most recently, in a meeting of an advisory group to the Chinese government -- the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference -- participants openly debated the question: whether to ""keep or dump"" North Korea? The two countries have evolved from vitriolic BFFs to East Asia's odd couple. When China and North Korea formed their alliance, the countries were both poor, weak, resentful, isolated, and the target of cold-war containment by the United States and its allies. While North Korea is still that country, China is emphatically not. China's remarkable four decades of economic reform and growth have catapulted it to wealth and power -- China is a global power, with global interests. China has a deep stake in maintaining stability in order to sustain its pathway to prosperity. China's relationship with the United States can be tense. But quite unlike in the days of Mao, the two countries are vital trade partners that share a vast array of ties and often overlapping interests. A look at North Korea's escalating rhetoric . Beijing also values its relationship with South Korea, which Pyongyang's provocations seriously jeopardize. Booming trade flows, warm political relations, and deeply intertwined ties have created a relationship that makes it increasingly awkward for Beijing to look away when North Korea murders South Koreans as it did in 2010 (with the sinking of the South Korean vessel Cheonan that killed 46 sailors, and when it shelled Yonpyeong Island). China is a great power that is increasingly concerned with its standing in the world, and with cultivating ""soft power."" Beijing's support for North Korea's ruthless, bloody regime -- that attacks its neighbors, and brutalizes its people at home -- only draws attention to China's own human rights failings, and undermines China's soft power. Because the specter of North Korea's collapse could potentially destabilize the Korea peninsula, Beijing may continue to shield Pyongyang. But the two countries' increasingly divergent interests suggest that China's dissatisfaction with North Korea is only likely to grow.","North Korean officials said the Korean Armistice Agreement is to be scrapped .

"As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children. Joining a handful of other carriers, United made the policy shift in late April with little fanfare. Previously, families with small children flying coach were allowed on aircraft before general boarding, a convenience for moms and dads trying to herd their kids across the friendly skies. ""We figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups,"" said United spokesman Charles Hobart. The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early. ""I have to wonder if it will end up slowing things down because of the extra time it takes for families to board,"" said Brett Snyder of the blog crankyflier.com. Kate Hanni of flyersrights.org calls the move ""very anti-family."" ""There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days, but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane,"" said Hanni in an e-mail to CNN. ""I hope United changes their mind."" ""If families do need additional assistance, our gate agent will work to accommodate them,"" Hobart said. ""That message has been communicated."" ""We're not going to fly United knowing that we're going to have to put up with that extra hassle,"" wrote Steven Manson, a Brooklyn, New York, father of twin 4-year-old boys. ""Frankly, we always look forward to the preboarding when we fly and try and position ourselves near the gate when boarding begins. It's just so helpful getting the car seat attached and everyone settled before the plane is crowded with passengers,"" Manson said in an e-mail to CNN. A guerrilla approach to flying with kids . The policy change also has roots in the merger announced in 2010 between United and Continental. ""We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft,"" Hobart said. As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding. However, the airline said it makes an announcement to all ticketed passengers before general boarding asking anyone who needs extra time or assistance to come forward. ""It would not be realistic to preboard that many families just on that sole basis alone,"" wrote an American Airlines spokeswoman in an e-mail to CNN. ""It could easily translate into most of the passengers for the flight."" JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said. Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets. So does Virgin America, which said it allows children under 5 to board early. US Airways tweaked its child preboarding rules within the past year -- allowing families with kids to get on the plane after the call for Zone 2, but before the general boarding announcement. Previously the airline had allowed earlier boarding. ""We're always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and quicker for our passengers,"" said spokeswoman Liz Landau.

"""Orange Is the New Black,"" and it's the new face of comedy, too. Since its debut in July 2013, the original Netflix series has become the poster child for the way many of us now watch TV -- in large doses, on our own time, and often on something other than an actual television set. But before ""Orange Is the New Black"" became the hottest topic for anyone with Internet access, it was a languishing concept from ""Weeds"" producer Jenji Kohan, who was struggling to find a home for the series based on a book by Piper Kerman. As viewers learned in season one, ""Orange Is the New Black"" follows a well-bred New Yorker named Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), who gets sent to a Connecticut women's prison on an old drug charge that involved smuggling money for ex-girlfriend Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), who just happens to be serving time in the same facility. While there, Chapman gets indoctrinated into prison life with a series of scenes that have become infamous, like a bloody tampon given to her in a sandwich and a cellmate urinating on the floor. Chapman, along with characters like Red (Kate Mulgrew), a grim Russian cook; Sophia (Laverne Cox), a transgender former firefighter; Crazy Eyes (Uzo Aduba), who's initially fixated on Chapman; and Pennsatucky (Taryn Manning), a disturbed drug addict, bring this dark comedy to life in a way that wouldn't have been out of place on pay-cable networks like HBO or Showtime. Except neither network wanted it. And then, in walked Netflix. With the company's image changing from being a source of mail-ordered movies to a streaming hub of entertainment, the service happily snapped up Kohan's dark comedy. As the writer/producer recalled to The New York Times, Netflix ""pretty much bought it in the room."" The company's eagerness has paid off in full, as ""Orange Is the New Black"" has become the service's most-watched original series, according to an October letter to shareholders, and is already renewed for a third season. But first, we have to prepare for season two's arrival on Friday. Though cast members and Kohan are tight-lipped about what's to come, here are a few tidbits on what to expect: . 1. Nudity. ""I love graphic sex, the more sex the better,"" Kohan said at an industry lunch in April. And the show has certainly put some of its performers on display right from showering get-go. This year may include male nudity, Kohan said, with a caveat: ""I don't think it's going to be erect."" 2. Triangle tension. You know that romantic triangle between prison guards Pornstache (Pablo Schreiber) and Bennett (Matt McGorry) and Daya (Dascha Polanco)? It's going to get messier. ""There's kind of a tectonic shift happening between Pornstache, Bennett and Daya by the big point of the second season, and I think you might be surprised who you may be siding with in that triumvirate,"" Schreiber told EW. 3. A rising writer. Larry's had some success with his column about having a fiancée in prison, but his relationship with her is under strain. ""If you're going to keep Larry involved, there needs to be some sort of change, and there are some in store,"" Jason Biggs, who plays Larry, told EW. 4. More romance and back story. Big Boo (Lea DeLaria) and Nicky (Natasha Lyonne) are going to have a ""sex contest,"" reports TV Guide.  We'll find out more about Red's (Kate Mulgrew) Russian gangster past. And watch out for a key insect. 5. A change of the guard? A number of ""Orange"" stars have commitments to other shows. Natasha Lyonne (Nicky) is doing an NBC show produced by Amy Poehler, and Schreiber is working on an HBO comedy. Laura Prepon (Alex) told the Daily Beast she will be in just four episodes in season two, though she's indicated she'd be willing to come back full-time for season three. Kohan is already thinking ahead. ""If I could keep cycling people through and bringing in new people, the show could go on forever,"" she told EW.","""Orange Is the New Black"" season two releases Friday, June 6 .

"Egyptians, angry at reports of inadequate security at a soccer match where 79 people died Wednesday in a riot, clashed with police, leaving two dead in the city of Suez and at least 900 injured in Cairo, officials said Friday. The injuries occurred near the Interior Ministry headquarters in Cairo, said Dr. Adel Adawi, a health ministry spokesman. Egypt's deputy health minister, Dr. Hisham Shiha, said on Egyptian TV that many of the casualties resulted from asphyxiation or bone fractures. The two fatalities in Suez died of gunshot wounds, said the general manager of Suez General Hospital. Earlier, hundreds of protesters attacked the security forces' headquarters in the city with rocks and Molotov cocktails; security forces fired tear gas and warning shots into the air, said Suez Police Maj. Mahmoud Mustapha. About 25 protesters were injured in Suez, he said. Thursday's violence occurred as the country began three days of mourning for those who died Wednesday in the Mediterranean city of Port Said. The soccer violence reignited demands for Egypt's military-led government to make reforms and improve security. An emergency parliamentary session was called. In Port Said, dried blood caked seats in the stadium where fans of the hometown Al-Masry club stormed the field after a 3-1 win over Cairo's Al-Ahly club. Rival fans battled with rocks and chairs, and witnesses said many of the Al-Masry fans carried knives and sticks. Many suffocated in the crush of bodies that formed as fans attempting to flee the stadium found their escape blocked by a locked steel gate, survivors said. In the aftermath, horrified fans questioned why police had not stopped the Al-Masry fans from rushing the visitors' stands, why exits were barred and how fans were able to take weapons into the stadium. ""We believe this is something that has been well-organized,"" said Khaled Mortagy, a member of Al-Ahly's governing board. ""I'm sure there are some hidden hands behind this, but we cannot really see, or we cannot really confirm, who is behind all that."" Mortagy said he believes the incident had nothing to do with sports. Members of the club are shaken by what occurred. At least 47 people were arrested after the clashes, said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a spokesman for Egypt's Interior Ministry. Mortagy said lawyers for Al-Ahly want to sit in on questioning by prosecutors as an investigation goes forward. ""It's a big catastrophe for Egyptian sports ... a black day for football,"" he said. The incident at  Port Said, at the mouth of the Suez Canal, ranks among the world's worst sports disasters. It prompted officials to suspend indefinitely Egypt's football premier league. See high-res images of the riots . Mamdouh Eid, executive manager of the Al-Ahly fans committee, said authorities contributed to the escalation of the violence. ""The police stood there watching, and the ambulances arrived late. I carried several dead fans in my arms,"" he said. But Gen. Ismail Osman, a member of Egypt's military council, told Mehwar TV on Thursday that the military and police were not responsible for what happened. And Mustapha said fans stoked tensions during the entire match. ""There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle,"" he said. ""Our policemen tried to contain them but not engage."" Egypt's fledgling parliament erupted in anger over the national tragedy, with the debate growing so heated that the body's speaker ordered a live broadcast of the session cut off. The order was retracted after lawmakers objected. Witnesses: Police stood idle . A committee will investigate the circumstances behind the riot. Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri suspended Port Said's security chief and the head of police investigation. The two men will face an inquiry. Ganzouri also accepted the resignation of Port Said's governor. A deputy of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party demanded the resignation of the interior minister, holding him responsible for the loss of life. It was unclear whether the riots were ignited by intense sporting rivalry or political strife. Egyptians just marked the anniversary of the revolution that toppled the longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. In Cairo, somber protesters in Tahrir Square  -- many dressed in popular Al-Ahly club attire -- decried Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, even though Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi had tried to allay their fears. ""The general prosecutor has started to investigate this saddening incident that hit all the Egyptian people with sorrow and regret,"" Tantawi told Nile TV. ""We will know what the reason is and who caused the catastrophe that happened in Port Said."" Tantawi said the incident is not ""something that will let Egypt fall.""","2 dead, 25 injured in Suez violence, police say .

"Climate change is here and will only worsen. Get used to more flooding, wildfires and drought, depending on where you live. Cities and states across America already are spending lots of money to respond. Those are the take-home messages of a new White House report released Tuesday that is part of President Barack Obama's second-term effort to prepare the nation for the impacts of a changing climate such as rising sea levels and increasingly erratic weather. The National Climate Assessment update said evidence of human-made climate change ""continues to strengthen"" and that ""Americans are noticing changes all around them."" ""This is not some distant problem of the future,"" Obama told NBC, while John Holdren, who directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said climate change ""already is affecting every region of the country and key sectors of the economy."" Read the National Climate Assessment . The Obama administration wants the report to ignite awareness of the need for government and communities to respond now to climate change in the face of fierce political opposition, mostly from conservatives. Unrelenting political opposition . A relentless campaign backed by the fossil fuel industry and its allies challenges whether climate change is real, and if so, whether human activity such as increased carbon emissions from power plants, factories and cars contributes to it. In a statement coinciding with the report's publication, the White House said the findings ""underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change, protect American citizens and communities today, and build a sustainable future for our kids and grandkids."" Breaking down the report by region . John Podesta, a Democratic operative who now counsels the President, told reporters that Obama will kick off a broad campaign this week to publicize the report, while Cabinet members and other administration officials would be ""fanning out"" across the country to spread the word about how climate change impacts specific regions. Republican critics immediately pounced on new report as a political tool for Obama to try to impose a regulatory agenda that would hurt the economy. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky mocked what he described as the hypocritical stance of ""liberal elites"" who demand strong action on climate change while failing to reduce their own carbon footprint. ""Even if we were to enact the kind of national energy regulations the President seems to want so badly, it would be unlikely to meaningfully impact global emissions anyway unless other major industrial nations do the same thing,"" McConnell said in arguing against proposals to reduce industrial pollution. He called the debate ""cynical"" because Obama knew that ""much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class."" Changing attitudes? To Podesta and Holdren, the reality of climate change will win out over opponents of new energy policies to combat it. ""Public awareness has been going up and will continue to go up,"" Holdren told reporters, predicting increased public support for government action to reduce U.S. carbon emissions and for America to take a leadership role on climate change in the international arena. Five things you can do . Recent polling indicates most Americans believe human activities cause climate change, but also shows the issue is less important to the public than the economy and other topics. A Gallup poll in March found that 34% of respondents think climate change, called global warming in the poll, posed a ""serious threat"" to their way of life, compared to 64% who responded ""no."" At the same time, more than 60% of respondents believed global warming was happening or would happen in their lifetime. More than 300 experts helped produce the report over several years, updating a previous assessment published in 2009. Podesta called it ""actionable science"" for policymakers and the public to use in forging a way forward. Scientists categorize the response to climate change into two strategies -- minimizing the effects by reducing the cause, which is known as mitigation, and preparing for impacts already occurring or certain to occur, which is called adaptation. The report breaks the country down by region and identifies specific threats should climate change continue. Major concerns cited by scientists involved in creating the report include rising sea levels along America's coasts, drought in the Southwest and prolonged fire seasons. Sea levels rising . It predicts sea levels will rise at least a foot by the end of the century and perhaps as much as four feet, depending on how much of the Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melts. Such an outcome could be catastrophic for millions of people living along the ocean, submerging tropical islands and encroaching on coastal areas. Low-lying U.S. cities already experience high flooding, with Miami planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to address the problem, noted Jerry Melillo of Marine Biological Laboratory, who chaired the advisory committee that produced the new assessment. The Great Plains could experience heavier droughts and heat waves with increasing frequency, while more wildfires in the West could threaten agriculture and residential communities, the report notes. Obama's week-long focus on climate change continues Wednesday, when the White House convenes a summit focused on green building tactics. Later in the week, Obama will announce new solar power initiatives, according to Podesta. In his first term, the President faced opposition by Republicans and some Democrats from states with major fossil fuel industries such as coal production to significant climate change legislation. He pledged to renew his efforts on the issue in his final four years, including using executive actions that bypass Congress. Obama has introduced new regulations on vehicle emissions and created ""climate hubs"" that help businesses prepare for the effects of climate change. A major upcoming issue is a proposal under consideration by the Obama administration to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental groups say the project would contribute to climate change because tar sands oil is dirtier than conventionally drilled crude, and importing it would maintain the country's dependence on fossil fuels. Republicans and some Democrats from oil industry states want the pipeline approved to create jobs and bolster exports from a strategic ally and U.S. neighbor. The new assessment calls for continued mitigation steps including regulations and programs to reduce carbon emissions, as well as necessary planning and investment to deal with the known impacts. Melillo cited some adaptation measures already underway, noting a ""terrific plan for extreme heat events"" by the city of Philadelphia. ""Things are starting to happen,"" Melillo said, adding that the continued efforts over time will ""ultimately present a very positive picture"" about Americans taking action on climate change.","President Obama says climate change happening now .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old was arrested late Tuesday after shining a powerful laser light into the eyes of a pilot who was approaching Los Angeles International Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The arrest puts a spotlight on what the FAA calls a dangerous problem in recent years. In Tuesday's case, the pilot was about 2,000 feet in the air and nobody was hurt in the incident, said Ian Gregor, an FAA spokesman. ""It's potentially very dangerous to shine a laser at an aircraft because a laser can distract a pilot and there have been cases where pilots have suffered temporary vision problems as a result of being struck by a laser beam,"" Gregor said. "" We've had reports of pilots having to turn over control of the aircraft to a co-pilot or had to abort landing.""

"The Marine Corps is working to determine the authenticity of photos published by TMZ.com that purport to show Marines burning the bodies of what appear to be Iraqi insurgents. The celebrity and gossip website said it has 41 photographs believed shot in Falluja in 2004. It published eight on Wednesday, saying the rest of the images were too graphic. ""The actions depicted in these photos are not what we expect from our service members, nor do they represent the honorable and professional service of the more than 2.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" the Defense Department said. ""The Marine Corps is currently investigating the veracity of these photos, circumstances involved, and if possible, the identities of the service members involved. The findings from this investigation will determine whether we are able to move forward with any investigation into possible wrongdoing."" Among the published photographs, a person in a Marine uniform appears to be pouring gasoline or some other flammable liquid on the bodies of insurgents. The remains are shown ablaze, and then charred. Islamic custom strictly forbids cremation. In another photograph, a Marine poses for the camera next to a human skull. ""There are well over a dozen bodies in the pics and some are covered with flies and one is being eaten by a dog,"" TMZ.com reported. It said it turned the photographs over to the Pentagon last week and that U.S. Central Command had reviewed them to see whether they had previously been brought to its attention. They had not. During the Iraq war, Falluja was the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents. The battles were among the worst Marines had seen since Vietnam, said former Marine Capt. Jonathan Rue. ""This looks really bad, but we don't know exactly what was happening, and we don't know what the circumstances were. Nor do we know exactly who was in those photos,"" he said. If the images prove authentic, it wouldn't be the first time Marines have come under fire for the treatment of enemy bodies. In July 2011, Marines urinated on dead Taliban fighters and posed for photographs with the corpses in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The incident did not come to light publicly until January of the following year, when a 39-second video showing the desecration was posted on the Internet. The video inflamed tensions over the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. ""People in battlefield situations do very strange and reprehensible things, and maybe that's simply part of life, and that's why you need to have a military justice system that can punish people and hopefully discourage this kind of conduct in the future,"" said Eugene Fidell, with Yale Law School, in response to the recently-published photographs.

""Jumping on the bandwagon is an age-old motivator of psychological behavior,"" wrote Goldbart and his colleague, Joan DiFuria. ""We want to be with the in-crowd, to be 'part of the movement,' not 'feel left out.'

Spend a little, get a lot -- the basis for every good investment. The low cost of a lottery ticket is one of the most seductive things about it. The lottery industry is often criticized for being an unfair tax on the poor. On average, households that make less than $12,400 a year spend 5% of their income on lotteries, according to Wired. In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University attempted to explain why the poor are more likely to buy lottery tickets. The study, published in the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, theorized that people focus on the cost-to-benefit ratio of a single ticket rather than add up the long-term cost of playing over a year, or a lifetime. Some study participants were given $1 at a time and asked if they wanted to spend each dollar on a lottery ticket, author George Loewenstein said. Others were given $5 and asked how many tickets they wanted to buy with the money. Members of a third group were told they could either spend $5 on lottery tickets or buy none at all. Ted Talks: How to buy happiness . People in the second group bought half as many as those given $1 at a time. In the all-or-nothing scenario, 87% of the study participants purchased zero tickets. The researchers' findings were consistent with something known as the ""peanuts effect."" ""There are money amounts that are small enough that people almost ignore them,"" Loewenstein said Wednesday. ""It almost doesn't feel real. The lottery and penny slots are kind of the sweet spot of risk taking. They're really cheap, really inexpensive to play, but there's a big possible upside."" Still, to say that playing the lottery is a bad idea doesn't sit well with the professor of economics and psychology.

"(CNN) -- Bill Maher, the man famous for hating religion, is now becoming infamous for hating one religion in particular: Islam. On last week's episode of his HBO show, ""Real Time,"" Maher got into a heated exchange with Ben Affleck over Maher's use of sweeping generalizations to define Islam. In fact, Affleck went as far as to dub Maher's views of Muslims as ""gross"" and ""racist."" (Maher had no Muslims on the panel in discussing Islam -- but that is typical for his show.) Maher's anti-Muslim comments are nothing new. I first noticed Maher's Muslim problem in 2010 when he said on his show, ""The most popular name in the United Kingdom, Great Britain -- this was in the news this week -- was Mohammed. Am I a racist to feel that I'm alarmed by that? Because I am. ... I don't have to apologize, do I, for not wanting the Western world to be taken over by Islam in 300 years?"" This was not about so called ""radical Islam."" Rather, Maher seemed alarmed that Muslims were growing in population. Flash forward to 2012, when Maher discussed how women are unfairly treated in certain Muslim countries, which is truly an issue deserving of discussion. But Maher chose not to rely on facts; instead, he offered anecdotal evidence to support his argument, saying things like, ""Talk to women who've ever dated an Arab man. The results are not good."" Well, my Sicilian mother not only dated an Arab man, she married him. And by all accounts, ""the results"" were great. Maher kept on advancing stereotypes about an entire people based on little evidence. He ratcheted up his anti-Muslim commentary while a guest on ""Charlie Rose"" last month. He said that it is ""naive"" to think that Islam isn't more violent than other religions and mocked President Obama for commenting that the terror group ISIS was not Islamic. Maher's remarks dismayed American Muslims across the country but won applause from all the hosts on Fox News' ""The Five."" When you're a progressive and a gaggle of Fox News hosts praises your views, you know something is seriously wrong. In recent weeks on his show, Maher gave us a long rant rallying liberals to stand up to Islam. For support, he cited the high instance of female genital mutilation in the Muslim-majority countries of Somalia and Egypt. Look, I agree with Maher that FGM is horrific. But as religious scholar Reza Aslan pointed out on CNN, FGM is based on African culture -- not Islam. African Christian-majority nations also have very high rates of FGM. In fact, there are far fewer reported cases of FGM in Muslim nations outside of Africa. Maher continued his personal jihad by claiming that Islam is like the Mafia, in that you will be killed if you attempt to leave the faith. Maher then cited a Pew Research poll that he claimed found that 90% of Egyptians supported the death penalty for those who left Islam. I'm not sure where Maher got his numbers, but a 2013 Pew poll actually found only 64% of Egyptians supported this -- still alarmingly high, but not 90%. More importantly, Egypt does not define the Muslim world. Rather, Egypt is simply one of 47 Muslim-majority nations. That same poll found that in Turkey, a nation that has almost as many Muslims as Egypt, less than 5% supported the death penalty for leaving Islam. Maher also has left out that only 13 Muslim nations have penalties for apostasy, while 34 do not. So who truly defines Islam? To Maher, clearly it's the worst of our faith. That's something you would expect to hear from a far-right bigot, not a liberal. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who was also a guest on last week's show, attempted to make that very point. Kristof, who was interrupted before finishing his thought, remarked about Maher's comments on Islam: ""This does have a tinge a little bit of how white racists talk about African-Americans."" Kristof was right. How can Maher not see that he's mimicking that same type of hateful mindset? I'm all for a discussion of the need to reform the laws in certain Muslim countries, especially on issues of rights for women, minority faiths and gays. But painting all Muslims by the most extreme of our faith is wrong. This is the kind of bigotry that Maher would've rallied against in the past. My fellow liberals should no longer give Maher a pass. His continuous drumbeat of reckless comments about Muslims is contributing to a climate where American Muslims are increasingly seen as ""the other"" -- or worse, as the enemy. Just because Maher is progressive on certain issues does not excuse his bigotry on this issue.","Dean Obeidallah: Bill Maher is becoming infamous for bashing Islamic religion .

"The Hippocratic Oath hangs heavy over a makeshift hospital in the besieged city of Al Qusayr, centuries of ethical code now dangerous to honor in a place where a doctor saving the life of a gasping child is labeled a terrorist. Dr. Kasem is aware that every patient could be his last. He and his hospital have endured rocket attacks. But he will not stop. The medical oath he took demands that he do all that he can to save lives. Instead, he keeps moving his hospital from building to building so that Syrian government forces will not discover it. ""If I will die when I help people, it is good for me,"" he says. ""Because I am a doctor. I must help people, especially in this very catastrophic time. After the revolution, before the revolution, during the revolution, I will help people."" Kasem works day in, day out. He and his staff rush to patch up bruised, bloodied and broken bodies. He hears motherless children howl and grown men belt out the kind of screams that can haunt for a lifetime. Kasem works away from the spotlight. He does nothing for glory. He does everything to stop death. His story has come to attention through Robert King, a journalist with Polaris Images, who wanted to document the critical work of Syria's secret hospitals. ""Since late April, I have been photographing and filming inside the besieged city of Al Qusayr,"" King says. ""One of my main focuses here is to tell the story of the volunteer doctors and nurses who work tirelessly 24 hours a day inside the only working hospital in the area."" King's camera follows Kasem through the chaos. Streams of crimson stain sheets and mattresses. The freshly lie on the ground. Rivers of red cover the patterns on a tiled floor. Outside, the thundering booms of mortars and constant rattle of gunfire. Doctors desperately try a defibrillator on a man who is already turning ghostly white. Occasionally, someone says: Allahu Akbar. God is great. The field hospital serves a population of about 40,000 people, King says. The daily log books are brimming with names. It's the only place for people in the area to seek help -- not just for war wounds but for simple everyday medical stuff like back pain and blood pressure. Occasionally the staff sees joy when they help deliver a baby. It's the only working hospital around since the local state hospital has been taken over by the Syrian army. The soldiers turned the place of healing into one of killing, Kasem says. They used it as a military base from which to attack the city. Snipers take aim from the hospital's rooftops. They have a perfect view from up high. Kasem's hospital is well within territory held by the Free Syrian Army, resistance fighters who are mainly Syrian military defectors. Al-Assad considers them terrorists and as such, the field hospital, a terrorist haven. ""Look at this child,"" Kasem says. King's camera pans over a boy with bandages over his body and tubes snaking out of his mouth. ""They see he is not a fighter, not an old man, not a young man."" The child is 6. He has severe injuries in his stomach, liver and kidney. Doctors operate on him using a table lamp for light. ""Why are they shooting him? Kasem asks. ""This regime is a terrorist regime."" He thinks the child will survive. God will help him. Several children, blood crusting on their skin, lie sideways on one gurney. A man bends to kiss a little girl on the forehead. Her lower torso is sliced open, exposing her organs. ""Doctor, what has happened here,"" King asks. ""I don't know,"" Kasem replies. ""The army of Assad. You see this child? They are a terrorist? King's camera captures a slice of Syria's horror. Efforts to gain peace dimmed this week with opposition reports of another massacre and intensified government bombardment of several cities and towns. Despite the chilling images sent in by journalists and opposition activists, King says Syrians like Dr. Kasem believe the world has turned away. ""The world is a very complacent place right now,"" King says. ""The lack of curiosity, concern, for their fellow humans is appalling. There's only one trained surgeon in the entire field hospital. He relies on his colleagues to learn fast on the job. Smugglers risk their lives to bring in medical supplies and surgical equipment, King says. But that might get harder -- Al Qusayr has been under seven long months of siege and one of the main supply routes from neighboring Lebanon is cut off. Despite the dwindling odds, King is convinced Dr. Kasem and his staff say they will go on performing medical miracles. King says Al-Assad failed to honor the Hippocratic Oath he likely took when he became a physician -- he is trained as an opthamologist. But Dr. Kasem is determined to stick to one of history's oldest binding documents.","Journalist Robert King captures the chaos within a secret hospital in besieged Al Qusayr .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers. On Wednesday, a grand jury declined to charge the New York Police Department officer whose chokehold contributed to the death of Eric Garner -- an incident captured in full on video. Unsurprisingly, Thursday brought cries of ""what's the use?"" After all, an officer walked even though there is a video of the killing. So, body cameras must not make any difference, right? Wrong. The fact is that even though the grand jury decided not to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo over Garner's death, having a video of the incident has still had a huge impact -- without the video, the story wouldn't be leading the headlines, and protesters wouldn't have assembled to demand change. Also, the video of Garner's arrest came from a cell phone, not from a police body camera. Would Pantaleo have used a banned chokehold if he knew his supervisor would be reviewing video of the arrest? Probably not. A body camera might therefore have saved Garner's life. People act better when they know they're being watched -- or recorded. Cops act better, and the people they encounter on the street are more cooperative. A study commissioned by the Police Foundation in 2012, for example, found that cops with body cameras were involved in far fewer use of force incidents than cops without. Opinion: Are police body cams really the answer? That same year, I praised Daytona Beach (Florida) Police Chief Michael Chitwood for his decision to fund and deploy body cameras for many of his officers, and the footage captured has helped me in cases I have handled. And, taking a broader perspective, the transparency inherent in such a program has also helped instill more trust among residents of the city. ""The cameras help defuse some of the tensions that might come up during encounters with the public,"" Chitwood said. ""I think that 98% of the time, cameras help improve relationships with the community."" We should also be careful not to draw too many conclusions about the ineffectiveness about video cameras simply because there was no indictment in New York. Remember, the 23-person grand jury in the Garner case saw more than just the video; they reportedly heard from 50 witnesses and pored through 60 exhibits (including other video) that the rest of us haven't seen. It's very possible, therefore, that while Pantaleo's actions were improper, they weren't technically illegal in this case. And that raises what may be one of the biggest issues to come from all this -- our existing laws and police policies may be unjust. Through our elected officials, we tell police officers when it is appropriate to use force, and we've told police they can use physical force to make an arrest, even for misdemeanors. We've also told police they can use deadly force to stop a dangerous fleeing felon. If we feel such standards on the use of force are unjust -- or that they are not being applied equally for all people, regardless of race -- then we need to demand that our elected leaders change these laws. But we cannot correct injustice if we cannot see it. Gandhi said that we ""must make the injustice visible,"" and that may be the real value of body cameras in policing. Body cameras have the potential not only to expose when cops break the rules, but they will also help expose laws that are unjust. Law enforcement, for their part, should not see body cameras as a threat, because they might well also show us that when cops have to make life or death decisions, they usually get it right. But that raises a point that is often lost when we are debating the actions of individual officers -- cops are not a gang of miscreants, waiting to murder and scheming to deny civil rights. Police officers have taken on one of the most dangerous jobs in our society. They protect citizens from other citizens, and they face the delicate task of balancing the rights of the aggrieved with the rights of the accused. Of course, we could make a blanket change to the laws and tell cops not to make arrests over misdemeanors. But if you own a business, you may quickly find that this means open season for your stock. And we could tell cops not to chase fleeing felons. But if burglars simply have to run from police to escape justice, then there will be a lot of criminals on the loose. Finally, we can tell our police officers never to draw their weapon unless drawn upon. Yet then we would be telling them to put their lives at even greater risk even as they are out there trying to protect ours. Constrain police too much, and remove their ability to exercise good judgment, and the about a dozen cops left willing to do the job will be ineffective -- and every criminal will know it. This isn't to suggest that the Pantaleo incident doesn't highlight how we need better trained cops with a community-based focus of law enforcement. But if we are to make the changes necessary then we must also accept that making some of the changes required is expensive -- the President's pledge of $263 million for 50,000 cameras, for example, is only a fraction of the more than 700,000 officers in the country. Ultimately, we must be willing to dig deep, because if we want a free and safe society, we have to be willing to pay for it.","Mark O'Mara: People act better when they know they're being watched .

"Seven years after its finale, one of the greatest cult hits in television history is making a return. ""Arrested Development"" lasted three season during its initial run on FOX, with critical acclaim but dismal ratings. Since its final episode aired in February 2006, a little thing called Netflix ushered in a new way of watching television. In doing so, the comedy found a massive following who kicked themselves for missing the dysfunctional antics of the Family Bluth before it received the dreaded ""canceled"" sentencing from prime-time television. In a rare move, the Emmy-winning comedy is making a return, with 15 new episodes with the original cast and crew in tow. After a reported bidding war among outlets, Netflix won the rights to the fourth season everyone hoped for, but no one saw coming. After numerous false starts and scheduling conflicts, series creator Mitch Hurwitz was finally able to work in time for his entire clan to continue the saga of the least redeemable family in Orange County. CNN recently caught up with the cast to discuss the new episodes, and star Jason Bateman appeared overjoyed at their family reunion. ""There really aren't a lot of shows that get to come back together, at least under these circumstances, where it's not a desperate retread and no one's really done much since the show went off the air. This was a celebratory gathering, a lot of good news, and we knew that we were being included in this effort that Netflix is making to change the way television is brought to people. We're just fortunate to be a part of that."" ""Arrested"" is the latest in Netflix's recent foray into producing original content, and marks a new way for people to enjoy television. For those who missed the show during its original run, Netflix made it possible to watch the entire series in one sitting. The increase in popularity for streaming and subscription services has created a culture of television binge-watching. Many fans of ""Arrested Development"" have never seen the show any other way, and on May 26, these same fans will have 15 new half-hours for their viewing pleasure. Portia de Rossi, aka Lindsay Bluth, admits to being a victim of binge-watching herself. ""I find it really frustrating to have to wait a week to watch a show, and I'm just so used to seeing things back to back when I want to see them. I think what Mitch has done with 'Arrested' for Netflix is even more brilliant because he's used that format and created something brand new within it."" With the abundance of reality series taking over both prime-time lineups and Nielsen ratings over the last decade, more and more people have begun turning to cable and premium networks to get their scripted television fix. Netflix is hoping to take a bite out of that population tuning away from the ""Big Five"" broadcast networks. In fact, these original series are even eligible for Primetime Emmy awards thanks to a recent rule change allowing broadband programming to be nominated alongside any broadcast, cable or premium network show. Will the magic that has kept the original 53 episodes as must-see television a decade since the show's debut still be there? The cast believe so and if this upcoming season is a success, don't expect this to be the last you see of Never Nudes, Cornballers, and frozen banana stands. Bateman is quick to point out that Season 4 is the first arc in a new story. ""It's a three-act story that was too big to put in a feature, so we put the first act in these episodes and a movie would be acts two and three."" That's right, the long-rumored film version of the series is still in the works. The stars of ""Arrested Development"" may have to keep their characters within arm's reach in the coming future. They said they reveled at the chance to jump back into the shoes of their Bluth personae, and Jessica Walter had no trouble slipping into boozy matriarch Lucille. ""How bad does this make me seem? It's not that difficult. I hope I'm not like her! But when you play something for three seasons like we did, it's sort of like bike riding: You never forget. As soon as I saw the script and saw the people the first day we were all together in that dysfunctional crazy family, it all came back."" Season 4 features an interesting twist on the show's successful formula. To make the most of the limited time scheduled with the entire cast at once, each episode of the new installment focuses on a different member of the Bluth family. For de Rossi, it was the few scenes the ensemble got to shoot together that made her feel back at home. ""Once I was reunited with my cast on the set of Lucille's penthouse, that was that moment where it all just kind of clicked, for all of us. Because it wasn't just me and Lindsay and what she was like; it was how she related to everybody else and her place in the family. That was really awesome and that was when it all came rushing back."" With the release just a week away, will fans both old and new turn out to get a new slice of afternoon delight? De Rossi believes everyone will walk away satisfied. ""It's going to feel the same as it did. I was surprised how similar it looked and felt, and although we are all older, somehow it all worked.""","Seven years after its network finale, cult TV show ""Arrested Development"" will return on Netflix .

"(CNN)Amber Vinson says she followed all the rules when caring for an Ebola patient. So how did the Texas nurse contract the deadly virus? ""I have no idea,"" she told CNN. ""I go through it almost daily in my mind: what happened, what went wrong. Because I was covered completely every time. I followed the CDC protocol. ... I never strayed. It is a mystery to me."" Vinson, who was declared Ebola-free last week after treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, spoke with CNN's Don Lemon in an exclusive interview that aired Thursday. She described her experience fighting the deadly virus and fired back at critics who said she should never have boarded commercial flights after treating an Ebola patient. ""I'm a nurse. I care. I care for me, I would not put myself in danger. First, I would not take Ebola to my family and my best girlfriends. I would not endanger families across the nation, potentially exposing them to anything,"" she said. ""I had no symptoms. There was no way, at that time -- I could not transmit it."" The 29-year-old nurse choked up thinking of the harsh reactions of some people after they learned she had Ebola. ""It's just not me,"" she said. ""All I do is care. All I want to do is help. I would never try to hurt anyone."" Opinion: Ebola will elevate respect for nurses . 'I did what I was supposed to do' Shortly after Vinson's diagnosis, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters that she shouldn't have taken the flights. ""The CDC guidance in this setting outlines the need for what is called controlled movement. That can include a charter plane, a car, but it does not include public transport,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director told reporters at the time. ""We will from this moment forward ensure that no other individual who is being monitored for exposure undergoes travel in any way other than controlled movement."" Vinson said she felt like Frieden blamed her without any basis. ""I did what I was supposed to do, and now you're saying I should not have flown,"" she said. ""You know, I checked multiple times before I even left Dallas to see if it was OK to go."" And when her return flight from Cleveland to Dallas got repeatedly delayed, Vinson said she checked her temperature multiple times and reported it to the Texas Health Department. Then her contact there would speak with the CDC. ""She would tell me if i was OK to go or not,"" Vinson said. ""And I got the OK every single time."" 'It's a struggle' Vinson's diagnosis came amid a wave of national concern about the possible spread of Ebola in the United States, especially after it became known she had flown on two commercial flights after treating Duncan. She became the second person known to have contracted Ebola in the United States, and the second nurse from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas to get the virus after caring for an Ebola patient. Learning that her colleague, nurse Nina Pham, had contracted Ebola was a shock, Vinson said. ""My heart dropped,"" Vinson said. ""I was afraid for myself. My first thought was, Nina is a great nurse. I know her nursing. She follows rules and protocol as closely as I do. If this happened to her, it can happen to me. It rocked my world."" Several days later, Vinson was diagnosed with Ebola after returning to Dallas from a trip to visit family in Ohio, where she was planning her wedding. Days after being inside a bridal shop, she was isolated in a hospital, fending off the virus. It wasn't an easy battle, Vinson said. ""It takes so much out of you. It really does. It is very draining. And even now ... walking a short distance, I get short of breath,"" she said. There were several particularly rough days, she said. ""You've got to force yourself to get up, and forcing yourself takes a lot out of you, too,"" she said. ""It's a struggle. You're fighting for your life."" Mom: 'I just wanted to be there' For Vinson's family, it was also a harrowing ordeal. Like television viewers across America, Debra Berry stared at a TV screen and saw her daughter walking from an ambulance into the airplane that would take her from Dallas to Atlanta for treatment. It was a devastating sight for Berry, who was quarantined in Dallas and so couldn't be with her daughter. ""I wouldn't have cared if she had triple Ebola. I'm her mother. Give it to me. Wrap me up in Hefty bags,"" she said. ""I just wanted to be there. Because I knew in my gut that she was alone."" Hearing remarks people made about her daughter didn't help. ""I think they could have used the science to guide the situation, rather than make the comments they they did,"" Berry said. Even now, she said, ""people just aren't listening."" ""I want them to hear that my daughter is a hero,"" she said. Vinson's fiance, Derrick Markray, said the intense media spotlight has been difficult. ""It's not like she's an entertainer who was looking for fame,"" he said. ""It found her."" In the interview with Lemon, he described the agony of the first days after Vinson's diagnosis. He feared the worst, realizing that if Vinson died, her remains would be discarded as hazardous waste; there wouldn't even be an urn at her funeral. ""The reality of it all just really set in, the gravity of it,"" he said. He wondered, ""Can our system really handle this?"" Ready to rebuild . Vinson survived the deadly virus. Doctors can't say for sure exactly what saved her, though they say her young age and how quickly she received treatment were likely factors. Going forward, Vinson said it's clear that more planning is necessary for U.S. hospitals to better handle Ebola. ""We weren't the best prepared,"" she said. ""We did not have extensive training. We did not have a level of feeling comfortable with putting on and taking off the protective equipment. We didn't have the time to practice it. There was not a lot of education done beforehand."" That, she said, is a lesson that hospitals need to take seriously. ""Everyone needs training,"" Vinson said. ""Health care providers need to feel comfortable. They need to feel like they're protected so they can provide the best care."" Vinson said nursing remains her passion, but she doesn't know when she'll be suiting up in scrubs again. ""Right now I have to take care of me,"" she said. ""It's taken weeks. I feel like I gain a little bit of strength every day,"" she said. ""But I know me, and I'm not at the position right now where I feel comfortable providing care."" For the 29-year-old nurse, it's also time to get her life back on track. After her diagnosis with Ebola, cleanup crews destroyed her engagement ring and the wedding binder she used to plan her upcoming nuptials. ""We've got to rebuild,"" she said. And if anyone else contracts Ebola, she's ready to step in -- this time by donating blood to help in their treatment. ""Are you going to give plasma?"" Lemon asked her. ""Absolutely,"" Vinson said, ""as soon as I am able to do so.""

"Kim Duplantier's three-story colonial plantation-style home survived Hurricane Katrina, albeit with 3 feet of unwelcome water on the bottom floor. But Isaac, still a hurricane when it made landfall in Louisiana, had something more in mind. The slow-moving storm presented an insidious calling card after heavy rains ""overtopped"" a levee in the town of Braithwaite in Plaquemines Parish. At 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, Duplantier said, a couple of inches of water were evident in her redbrick home and in her parents' residence nearby. At 6 a.m., there was 4 feet of water. By 7 a.m., her bedroom, an antique grand piano, a grandfather clock and a whole lot more were inundated by 9 feet of water. How to help . ""We were very prepared,"" said Duplantier, who had evacuated Monday with her children to New Orleans while her husband and parents stayed behind. The family was coping with the latest weather disaster in Plaquemines Parish, where dozens of people were rescued Wednesday and as many as 800 homes suffered significant water damage. The parish is just southeast of New Orleans. Quoting her 17-year-old son, Duplantier said, ""Katrina took away the shock value."" Plaquemines Parish, split into the East Bank and West Bank by the Mississippi River, appeared to be the epicenter of Isaac's wrath. The Duplantiers live on the East Bank. It was the back levee, one of two, that overtopped Wednesday. Officials were considering intentionally breaching the levee, a second line of flood defense, to allow some of the floodwater to flow back out of the inundated area, Gov. Bobby Jindal said. According to The Times-Picayune, the digging might begin Thursday. Garret Graves, chair of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, told the paper that the state had agreed to the plan to start digging as soon as conditions allow. Parish president Billy Nungesser said Wednesday evening that crews will travel to the area Thursday morning by air boat to study the situation. ""We have to wait for the water to be out enough to see the levee,"" he said. If the decision is made to cut the levee, it likely won't happen before Saturday, according to Nungesser. The receding water would flow back into the marsh and would not affect other communities, Nungesser said. Meanwhile, about 3,000 parish residents remained in one area close to an 8-foot tall West Bank levee that waters were threatening Wednesday evening, according to Jindal's office. A mandatory evacuation was ordered south of Belle Chasse because models show the water will reach 8 feet. The National Guard, meanwhile, evacuated 112 residents from the Riverbend nursing home in Belle Chasse, officials said. Nungesser said at least four levees were overtopped, creating a kind of flooding the parish did not see even during Hurricane Katrina, which hit seven years ago Wednesday. ""This storm kept pumping that water for days up against the levees,"" said Nungesser. ""Something had to give."" The waterlogged parish is asking for President Barack Obama to declare a local federal disaster, making it eligible for assistance. ""That is going to be so needed,"" said Nungesser. More than 150 calls came in to 911 from people wanting to be rescued, said Terry Rutherford, commander of authorities in Plaquemines Parish, after the levee on the East Bank overtopped. By mid-morning, 75 people had been rescued from flooded homes and rooftops in Braithwaite, CNN affiliate WWL reported. The levee is maintained by the parish and has not been part of the federal hurricane protection levee system, according to officials. Katrina breached the levee in two places, the Army Corps of Engineers said. A mandatory evacuation was ordered at noon Monday on the East Bank. ""It's very unfortunate that people did not heed the warnings,"" said Sen. Mary Landrieu, adding, ""our hearts go out"" to them. The New Orleans levee system was rebuilt and reinforced at a cost of $14 billion after it failed when Katrina struck in 2005. Landrieu said she was among some officials who had pushed for Plaquemines Parish to be included in the federally funded projects, but the corps follows a formula ""based on economic impact"" that leaves out some rural or sparsely populated areas. ""It's heartbreaking to watch people climb out of their attics and onto their roofs in search of safety,"" she said. ""Hurricane Isaac has reinforced for us once again just how vulnerable these critical areas are. We must re-engage the Corps of Engineers on this."" However, Jindal said the levee has been under construction for about a year. Federal dollars have been appropriated for the levee since Katrina, according to a statement. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the nonfederal levees are slated for improvements and incorporation into the federal system. A cost-share agreement was signed in June. Isaac ""delivered more of a punch than originally thought,"" said Nungesser. ""We have reports of people on their roofs, in attics, in 12 to 14 feet of water."" Parish resident Gene Oddo told WWL that he was in his attic with his wife and 18-month-old baby girl. ""The water came up so quick, it looks like we lost everything,"" he said. He and his wife have drinking water, baby food and other necessities, he said. According to Jindal's office, vehicles and boats were assisting in rescues along the East Bank near Braithwaite. There were unconfirmed reports that up to 40 people still needed assistance. Kim Duplantier's mother took photos of the flooding in Braithwaite before she and Duplantier's father were evacuated by boat Wednesday afternoon. Duplantier's husband, a veterinarian, had a power generator and was staying Wednesday on the second floor of their home. In what must have been a rather surreal scene, at least one of the family's horses could be seen on a levee. Their goats were likely perched on it, too, Duplantier said. Nungesser said he couldn't get to his house, unlike the various animals that have taken refuge at the property. CNN iReporter Kayla Robin, who took photos of the Braithwaite flooding and rescue arrivals, said the experience was horrific. ""When they got in, you can tell they were in shock and weren't expecting this,"" she said. Robin, 20, lives in Caernarvon in St. Bernard Parish, right next to Braithwaite. She lives to the east of a floodgate that protected St. Bernard from the floodwaters. Robin said there was no water in her home, although there was calf-high water in the streets. ""It was traumatic going to the wall and seeing both sides at one time,"" said Robin of the contrasting situations. ""Thankfully, we have everything -- but these people (on the other side) are reliving Katrina seven years later.""

"A new class of cholesterol-fighting drugs could be coming to patients in the not-so-distant future, and experts say they could be a real game-changer in Americans' battle to lower artery-clogging LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol. The drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, work to suppress a particular gene that regulates how much cholesterol the liver can filter out of the body. In early phase 3 trials, the inhibitors have shown to be safe and to work in reducing LDL cholesterol levels to previously unknown lows. As interesting as the drugs themselves is the process by which they were discovered. Ten years ago, researchers found a family in Paris with a long history of extremely high levels of LDL, incidents of cardiovascular disease and early deaths, says Dr. Jay Edelberg, global head of PCSK9 development for Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company working on a PCSK9 inhibitor in partnership with Regeneron. Tests revealed that the family had a rare mutation on the gene called PCSK9. Additional studies showed that individuals with underactive PCSK9 genes had low levels of LDL and, much more important, low levels of cardiovascular disease. ""That became the most exciting potential target in cardiovascular medicine,"" Edelberg said. It's this discovery that has Sanofi and two other major drug companies, Amgen and Pfizer, racing to develop a drug that mimics the gene's effects. The best approach, experts say, will be through monoclonal antibodies: antibodies that are created in a lab and help your immune system fight a disease or, in this case, fight cholesterol. ""PCSK9 inhibitors could offer an important treatment option for patients, particularly for those who are in need of greater LDL-C reductions beyond what the current standards of care can offer,"" said MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for Pfizer, one of the companies working on this new type of drug. ""This is not to replace statin therapy,"" said Joe Miletich, senior vice president of research and development at Amgen. ""This is actually to get patients to (their) goal who can't get there."" TIME: Statins safe for most people . Normal LDL levels hover somewhere in the 100 to 130 mg/dL range, according to the American Heart Association. Anything above that, your doctor starts to get concerned. ""With a statin medication, you can often get somebody's cholesterol between 70 and 100 mg/dL,"" said Dr. Elliott Antman, president-elect of the American Heart Association and a dean at Harvard Medical School. ""If you use these monoclonal antibodies, you could see a number way less than 50."" This excites doctors like Antman, who is not connected to the research but often sees patients with cholesterol numbers in the hundreds. ""I would say this is a game changer."" But is there such a thing as cholesterol levels being too low? We don't really know, Antman says, but he believes the lower, the better. ""Infants, when they're less than a year old, have smooth arteries, and their LDL is 40 or less,"" he said. The initial research into the PCSK9 gene also found people with virtually no PCSK9 activity who lived their entire lives with extremely low cholesterol. Researchers observed no ill effects in those patients. The safety data from the clinical trials are good, and experts say these drugs could help patients who can't tolerate or do not respond to traditional cholesterol-lowering drugs. ""Monoclonals were generally well-tolerated,"" Antman said. ""Although the studies weren't comprised of millions of patients and duration of follow-up wasn't as long as we'd like, the signals we're seeing are all very positive."" As excited as the pharmaceutical giants are about this new discovery, this isn't ready for prime time. For one thing, the drugs are not approved by the FDA, although Antman said it probably won't be long. ""These drugs are of such great interest that there will likely be an aggressive approach to conducting large-scale trials for FDA approval and perhaps expedited review,"" he said.  ""It's hard to know exactly when these drugs will be available, but I'm guessing it'll be less than two years."" Another issue with the drugs is that they can't be taken orally. ""You can't swallow this, because the digestive enzymes in your stomach would break up the protein,"" Antman said. ""It's given by subcutaneous injections (into a lower level of skin), but this can be done with very small needles."" Researchers say patients would need to give themselves injections only every two to four weeks, which, depending on how often they're taking pills to lower cholesterol, may be a less cumbersome option. Finally, these types of medications are very expensive to make and difficult to store and require a much more extensive manufacturing process than a pill. ""They are heat-sensitive and open to risk of microbial contamination, so issues of shelf life and handling are always front and center,"" Antman said. ""This means they're probably going to be more expensive than pills."" But Antman believes, as the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. ""How much is it worth to use a more expensive treatment up front to avoid downstream events that are more expensive?"" he asked. ""If you think prevention is expensive, try treating disease.""","Drugs suppress a gene that regulates how much cholesterol liver filters out .

"Even after Boomer Esiason apologized for what he called his ""insensitive"" comment about scheduling a C-section before the season started, his suggestion plus critical stances by other radio hosts demonstrate how much paternity leave is still not widely accepted in our society. In conversations with men across the country, it's clear that while most join many women in expressing outrage at the view that a Major League Baseball game should come before the birth of a child, there were men who felt the player should have gotten back to his job as quickly as possible. By now, you probably know the particulars: the New York Mets' Daniel Murphy missed the first two games of the season to attend his son's birth. He didn't do anything he wasn't allowed to do. Major League Baseball permits a player to take up to three days off for paternity leave. But Esiason, his radio co-host Craig Carton and another WFAN radio host, Mike Francesa, had a very hard time understanding why Murphy would take another day -- and be off the field -- after his son was born. ""You're a Major League Baseball player. You can hire a nurse,"" said Francesa on his radio show. Esiason pulled back completely from his initial comment that if he were in Murphy's shoes, he would have had his wife schedule a C-section before the season started. ""My flippant comment was insensitive,"" said Esiason on his radio show Friday, a day after intense criticism of his remarks. ""I feel terrible for the Murphy family because what should be the greatest time in their life turned out to be somewhat of a firestorm that I personally put them into. And for that, hopefully, they can find forgiveness in their heart."" A father of three, who did not want to be identified, said his biggest beef was not with Esiason but with Francesa's comments that Murphy wasn't needed after his son's birth, or that anything he could have done could have been handled by a hired nurse. ""That is total garbage,"" said this dad via Facebook. ""Whether a man makes minimum wage or the salary of a Major League ball player, his family deserves his undivided attention at the birth of his child. It doesn't matter if he can easily hire someone to handle all the things that need to be done -- there is no substitute for the sense of accomplishment a man can get from having done it himself."" Mike Adamick, a stay-at-home dad in San Francisco, writer and author of ""Dad's Book of Awesome Projects,"" found the comments of Esiason and the other radio hosts ""really sad"" but believes the fact that the controversy involves a discussion about paternity leave is positive. ""I'd like to think that if there's a silver lining from all this, it's the realization or the confirmation that dads do want to be involved, and that the expectation is really gone away from wandering around the hallways handing out cigars to wanting to be in the birth room and being involved and hands-on from the get-go,"" said Adamick, who has another book coming out in a few weeks, ""Dad's Book of Awesome Science Experiments."" But not all men think a man's role is being by his wife and his new child's side. On CNN Living's Facebook page, a man named Michael said he agreed with Esiason regarding scheduling a C-section before the season got underway. ""It may seem insensitive but it's a very special situation being a Major League Baseball player. I know in almost every other profession the right thing to do is to strap your boots on and go back to work because that's what the man of the house does. ""Could he not afford to hire a nurse to wait on his wife hand and foot?"" he added. ""Real men don't take paternity leave,"" said a man named Robert on CNN's Facebook page. When pressed by another commenter that it's no longer the 1950s, Robert responded, ""I wish it were the '50s. Those were the days when men were men."" Said another man on Facebook, ""My belief is that it's a generation gap opinion. When (Esiason) had kids, he was back to work the next day."" Indeed, just by looking at the increase in the number of stay-at-home dads in the United States, it's clear our attitudes are shifting, even though not as rapidly as some would hope. ""I think people have really latched onto the idea that no, culturally we've changed, and we want to go in the direction of more involved dads as opposed to backwards of 'Ward Cleaver' checking in from out in the waiting room,"" said Adamick, who is the primary caregiver for his soon-to-be 8-year-old daughter. Still, when compared to our European counterparts, we are pretty much in the dark ages as far as paternity leave is concerned. In Sweden, men get a minimum of two months paid paternity leave; in Norway, they can take 10 weeks paid; and in Spain, they get four weeks. In the United States, there is no mandated paid paternity leave, although some companies do allow men to take 10 days off with pay. ""In my case, I had to use vacation days when my twins were born,"" said the father of three, who didn't want to be identified. ""I get that we live in a world where women aren't treated equally to men when it comes to pay, promotions and a slew of other areas, but there are also areas where men's needs are treated as inferior to those of a woman, and becoming a parent is a prime example,"" he added. Will we, one day, get to a place where paternity leave is as accepted as maternity leave? Even paternity leave supporters say that's not likely. ""From a cold hard political standpoint, for some reason, we just feel like you take time off and you're a loafer, you're a taker, (a) grabber,"" said Adamick. But as more Daniel Murphys come forward and make decisions that they say are best for their families, maybe, just maybe, we'll move closer to the approach of our friends abroad. Adamick said, ""In terms of just being socially good for everybody ... having kids raised in a loving family and to start them from the get-go with two involved parents ... I don't see how that could possibly be bad and I hope that one day we can get there."" Do you think men should be able to take paternity leave -- no matter their profession?

"Matt Logelin's days are filled with the same struggles as any dad's: He's looking for a job, trying to explain the world to his 6-year-old daughter and still get a decent night's sleep. But he's doing it on his own. The 36-year-old penned the New York Times best-seller ""Two Kisses for Maddy"" about his journey into fatherhood with his daughter Madeleine, known as Maddy, after his wife, Liz, died from a pulmonary embolism less than a day after giving birth in 2008. Maddy ""has taught me to let go of a lot of things and get lost in that moment,"" said Logelin,  co-author of the forthcoming picture book ""Be Glad Your Dad...,"" which will be published by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers in June 2016. ""I'm lucky; I hate that Liz is gone, but I feel lucky that I'm here with Maddy because she's a wonderful little kid."" He's running one of the 2.6 million households headed by a single father in the United States, according to a 2011 analysis by the Pew Research Center, and part of a growing number of stay-at-home dads. An analysis released this month by Pew found that the number of dads who stay at home has nearly doubled from 1.1 million in 1989. While much of that number is due to illness and disability (35%) or unemployment (23%), the study found the ""biggest contributor to the long-term growth"" of stay-at-home dads are those who stay home to care for home and family -- 21% in 2012 compared to 5% in 1989. Despite the growth, there are significant trials -- and triumphs -- in being a single dad and a stay-at-home dad in a country where it's not the norm. Here's Logelin's take on what he's learned from fatherhood; the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: What's the typical reaction to your current lifestyle? Matt Logelin: I get praised for so much because I'm a dad doing what a mom does. If I post a photo of my kid walking down the street with a smile, somebody will usually comment, ""You're giving your child the best life!"" This is one single moment; you have no idea if I'm cooking meth in my bathtub. Yet, I'm getting praised for having my child smile in the photo. It's always nice to hear nice things, but my kid is no different than anybody else's. I get so much more credit than I deserve as a single dad. I don't believe there is a motherly instinct, I believe there is a humanly instinct. The complicated and common world of single parenthood . CNN: So, you think there are misconceptions about single and/or stay-at-home dads? Logelin: People still look at people sideways who give that answer. Right now, as I'm trying to find a job, there's a 4½-year gap in my resume. There are all these assumptions that I've been sitting at home watching ""Wendy Williams"" -- which does happen -- but I am a busy person. The level of acceptance isn't there yet. There are a lot of reasons that fathers have that reputation; they're often portrayed as bumbling idiots in media. I know a few single dads who are stay-at-home dads who aren't work-at-home dads, and people still think that they're just lazy. CNN: When asked, how do you define what you do? Logelin: I wear so many different hats. I don't like to call myself an author -- I find it so pretentious. One time I built a retaining wall in my backyard, but I'm not a stonemason. At this point, I'm struggling with that identity. I, of course, consider myself a dad, but I don't want to be defined by that. I see the Instagram profiles that describe the person as ""husband of,"" ""wife to,"" ""parent of"" and I don't want to have that -- I don't want to be defined by one thing. CNN: Take us back to that day when you got the title of ""dad"" -- and the day that everything changed. Were you worried about fulfilling two roles instead of one? Logelin: I lost my partner and my best friend, but I also lost a mother, a female influence that was going to be the guiding force in Madeleine's life. I thought ""How am I going to take her to the store one day and buy a training bra? I don't even know what the f--k a training bra is."" There were those obvious concerns, like describing a menstrual cycle with what I learned about it in high school. I looked more at the differences of me as a man and this potential young woman, instead of finding the commonalities. I was used to my brothers making pipe bombs and blowing up mailboxes; I was used to that kind of world. I had all these assumptions of how I should raise a daughter. CNN: What do you wish someone had told you as you began your journey into fatherhood? Logelin: To not assume too much. I assumed so much about who my daughter was going to be. To not assume how my child was going to turn out because of the way she was born. I was worried about the lack of a female influence in her life. I worried so much about screwing her up, but I'm not her sole influence. She's got a lot of people in her world that help shape her. Knowing that would've taken so much pressure off of me. The bravest man I know . CNN: A little role reversal here -- what has Maddy taught you on your journey? Logelin: So, I was super proud that I learned how to braid her hair, but recently, she decided she wanted to get her hair cut my length. I went to talk to her about how people might receive it. I was worried about how she was going to feel and if someone would hurt her feelings; I got her prepared for the sh-t people are going to say. She just looked at me with a grin, ""I don't care."" Kids are just so great about being unconcerned -- to have that level of confidence! That's such a cool lesson to see this kid who is 6 years old and doesn't care that people might think she's a boy. I don't have to let the world know that I have a daughter; it's a really cool way to live. CNN: You've had some choice words about Father's Day, specifically that it's ""a bullsh-t holiday created to help sell greeting cards and grills and ties and other garbage."" Has your view changed? Logelin: It's basically any other day. I think Father's Day is a bigger deal if you have someone around to make it a big deal. Father's Day can be where the kid finally draws the dad a picture or makes pottery that says ""No. 1 Dad!"" -- and that's needed in a different relationship. Father's Day is a bigger deal for some people, and it would be if I had a wife around that did most of the household stuff. I hate even saying this, but every day is Father's Day. Every picture Maddy draws is for me. I get to sit and talk to her and get her full attention at dinner. All the stuff that fathers typically do on Father's Day, we do that every single day.

"(CNN) -- Millions of American parents spend countless hours trying to figure out how to help their children get better grades, better teachers or better schools. They may want to take a page from Finland, which is considered to have one of the leading education systems in the world. Finnish students consistently score near the top in the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, for reading, mathematics and science. The 2012 PISA results tell us that in these three subjects combined Finland ranks third after Korea and Japan. In comparison, American students' combined performance in reading, mathematics and science places the United States at 21st among 34 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. For some, education in Finland is utopia: a dreamland where teaching is the most desired profession, authorities trust schools and political parties agree on the direction of educational reforms. For others, they are surprised to hear that in Finland children don't start school until they are 7 years old. They have less homework than their peers in other countries. A child's socioeconomic background is less of an impediment to academic performance. And there is only one standardized test, which is administered in the final year of high school. What are the main factors that prevent American students from achieving the kind of success that Finnish students attain? There are three things that have positively affected the quality of Finnish schools that are absent in American schools. First, Finland has built a school system that has over time strengthened educational equity. This means early childhood education for all children, funding all schools so they can better serve those with special educational needs, access to health and well-being services for all children in all schools, and a national curriculum that insists that schools focus on the whole child rather than narrow academic achievement. Opinion: Should schools ban homework? Second, teachers in Finland have time to work together with their colleagues during the school day. According to the most recent data provided by the OECD the average teaching load of junior high school teachers in Finland is about half what it is in the United States. That enables teachers to build professional networks, share ideas and best practices. This is an important condition to enhancing teaching quality. Finally, play constitutes a significant part of individual growth and learning in Finnish schools. Every class must be followed by a 15-minute recess break so children can spend time outside on their own activities. Schooldays are also shorter in Finland than in the United States, and primary schools keep the homework load to a minimum so students have time for their own hobbies and friends when school is over. The difference is pronounced in America, where a national poll of elementary school principals found that up to 40% of U.S. school districts have reduced or eliminated recess in order to free more time for core academics, and one in four elementary schools no longer provides recess to all grades. I hear people often arguing that because the United States is much bigger, more diverse, and more unequal, it's harder to reach higher quality education. But even if this were true, it would not explain why in Finland students learn better in their schools than in most other places in the world. Opinion: Let kids sleep late . Some aspects of the American school system are not helpful in improving education quality and equity. First, education in the United States is too much defined by testing and data. If getting the data using frequent standardized tests occupies up to one-third of all available time to teach, that will alone prevent students from making the marks they should. Second, American education places too much faith in marketplace choice, which parents have because of expanded access to charter schools. This weakens the public school structure that is fundamental to many successful education systems elsewhere. Finally, more students in America have novice or nonprofessional teachers in their classrooms today than ever. Frequent turnover of teachers in thousands of American schools undermines the entire education system. What would be the way forward then? The United States can't become Finland, but there is a lot it can learn about what works and what doesn't. One affordable and smart step would be to terminate policies and practices that prevent American teachers from teaching what matters most to their students. Redesigning current punitive accountability for schools and abolishing unnecessary standardized tests would remove a big burden from schools and leave teachers with more time to focus on real learning. Opinion: Get schools out of the 1890s . The ultimate test for the American education system will be whether it can bring equity to the forefront of education policies. When poverty explains up to half of student achievement, schools must have measures to better cope with the harmful consequences that disadvantaged family backgrounds have on teaching and learning in many schools. Enhancing equity has been one key to success in Finland.","Many American parents worry about their kids getting good grades and doing well in school .

"Three numbers to keep in mind Tuesday night as President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address: six, 30 and 43. Six as in the number of seats Republicans need to gain this November to take control of the Senate. 30: The historical average of House seats gained by the other party -- in this case the Republicans -- in a two-term president's ""six-year itch"" midterm election. And 43%, of course, is Obama's job approval rating -- a reminder that his political standing is weak, though up slightly from its recent low point, as he stands before a closely divided Congress -- and country -- to lay out his agenda for year six of his presidency. ""One of the greatest powers a president has is the power to set the agenda,"" said veteran Democratic strategist and wordsmith Paul Begala, a close adviser to former President Bill Clinton. ""He (Obama) will use that power to great effect in the State of the Union address."" Here's how we see the state of the Union . Another Clinton White House veteran disagreed, arguing this president is too weakened and the 2014 campaign landscape too troublesome to seize the initiative. ""State of the Union means nothing,"" this Democrat said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. ""Re-read last year's address. How relevant was it last year in terms of how 2013 turned out?"" In fact, Obama failed to get any of his top 2013 State of the Union priorities through Congress. Congress ignored his calls for a new jobs program, for new gun controls and for sweeping immigration reform. Because of that, the 2014 speech is viewed by strategists in both parties as part of a defining test: Can Obama rebuild his standing enough to force action on some of his priorities, or will 2014 instead be remembered as another frustrating year of gridlock and the gateway to ""lame duck"" status? To that end, many see this speech -- this wish list -- as potentially his last chance for significant action. 8 memorable State of the Union moments . ""At this stage of a presidency, a State of the Union address cannot be expected to have much, if any, consequence in terms of public opinion,"" said leading Republican pollster Bill McInturff. Despite all the attention, McInturff called the speech ""an ephemeral event that is perhaps a short-term focus of the ultimate D.C. policy insiders."" As always, the State of the Union is a policy address, a chance for the President to lay out his wish list to the Congress and the American people. But it is always a political stage as well, a dramatic nationally televised theater for the President to frame his argument. This year, even as he asks Congress to act on economic and other initiatives, President Obama will distance himself from an unpopular Congress and promise to use executive powers to implement some of his priorities. The stakes are enormous: As the President delivers his speech, the odds -- and the early election year data -- suggest Republicans will not only keep their House majority but also have a good chance to capture control of the Senate. How would complete Republican control of Congress alter the final two years of the Obama presidency?  It is a debate worth having, yet one that can wait a bit, as we first test whether the President has better luck with Congress in 2014 than he did in 2013, and whether he can bend the political climate back more in his favor. Gingrich: Obama playing a weak hand at State of the Union . Which is where those numbers come in. The White House says its No. 1 political goal this year is protecting the Democratic majority in the Senate. Yet that goal -- blocking Republicans from a net six-seat gain -- could significantly complicate the President's policy agenda. Several of the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents are from states Obama lost badly in 2012: Arkansas, Alaska and Louisiana to name three.  Those and other Democrats are opposed to some things the President wants -- like new gun controls -- and in favor of ideas the White House is against, including modifications to the President's health care law. Zelizer: Six ways to fight inequality . Begala acknowledges the tough political environment facing the President. But he says he can navigate it with a smartly crafted 2014 State of the Union wish list. ""How can he help red-state Democrats running in places where he lost badly?"" Begala said. ""By raising issues that play well in places he doesn't.  So you will hear a lot about middle-class economics: raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, pay equity and workplace fairness for working women, greater access to child care for working moms, pre-K for young kids and college aid for young adults. "" The House Republican majority opposes most of the President's ideas, though there have been some discussions testing whether compromises can be reached on the minimum wage, unemployment insurance and, from time to time, even immigration policy. The historical average for a two-term president's party in this sixth year midterm is a loss of 30 House seats. Even the most optimistic Republicans view that as unlikely, given the shrinking number of competitive House districts. But Republican flexibility in policy discussions could depend on their own November midterm calculations, and at the moment top party strategists predict GOP gains in the high single digits on the House side. Republicans say Obama has a lot of explaining to do . ""They will oppose his popular economic agenda at their own political peril,"" Begala said, holding out hope the President would have an opportunity either to score policy successes or bend the political momentum back in his favor. The 43% number is the one worth watching as the year unfolds -- midterm elections are shaped most by the President's standing. If Obama can climb closer to 50%, Democratic chances improve significantly. If he slips closer to 40% or below, then a GOP takeover of the Senate becomes more and more likely. A little history: . In 2006, President George W. Bush had an identical 43% job approval rating at the time of his State of the Union address. There was little fear of the President in Congress then, in either party, and as a result little of his agenda was enacted -- immigration and Social Security changes were among the goals Bush laid out. Come November 2006, Republicans lost 30 House seats, and their majority. 7 things you didn't know about the State of the Union . Bill Clinton, on the other hand, had a 59% approval rating to begin his sixth year in office, and Ronald Reagan was at 64% around his 1986 State of the Union. Democrats defied the historical averages in the Clinton ""six-year itch"" election; Republicans actually lost five House seats, and the Senate balance of power was unchanged. In 1986, then-majority Democrats made only modest gains in the House (plus five seats), but did pick up eight Senate seats to take control of that chamber. Outside of Washington, observers like New Hampshire GOP activist Thomas Rath see an opportunity if the President ""acknowledge(d) at the outset that overwhelmingly Americans share a common belief -- Washington does not work. He should acknowledge that both parties share that blame; both are responsible."" Rath's advice? ""He needs to listen to the mood of this country and understand that folks do not want to hear a partisan harangue but rather want a strong message of leadership and cooperation from the man they elected to do just that."" And Rath's election-year State of the Union prediction: ""He will do nothing of this sort.""

"Is it possible to trademark the name of a holiday? The Walt Disney Company was interested in doing so. On May 1, the entertainment giant filed an application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to secure the phrase ""Día de los Muertos,"" or ""Day of the Dead,"" across multiple platforms. Disney subsidiary Pixar is releasing a film -- for time being called ""The Untitled Pixar Movie About Dia de los Muertos"" -- this fall. Here's the problem -- Día de los Muertos is a traditional holiday celebrated on November 1 and 2 in Mexico and across Latin America. People honor the lives of lost family members or friends by building altars, holding processions, decorating gravesites and placing offerings for loved ones. Over the years, the holiday has gained a foothold in the United States, too. Disney hoped to secure the rights to the title ""Day of the Dead"" and such themed merchandise as fruit preserves, fruit-based snacks, toys, games, clothing, footwear, backpacks, clocks and jewelry. But the Latino community raised a ruckus about the application on social media. Tweets included ""Tell @Disney not to trademark Day of the Dead. Culture is NOT for sale!"" from Presente.org, a national organization that ""exists to amplify the political voice of Latino communities."" ""Are we okay with @DisneyPixar commercializing our culture?"" tweeted Think Mexican, a Tumblr blog that says it's aimed at ""connecting the Mexican community through culture and information."" ""How could Disney allow such a blunder,"" marveled Lalo Alcaraz, a Mexican-American editorial cartoonist and founder of Pocho.com. ""I knew they weren't copyrighting the holiday, but I couldn't believe they would let someone in their legal department let this happen. On the surface, it looks like Disney is trying to copyright the holiday."" Alcaraz is the author of La Cucaracha, a nationally syndicated comic that focuses on the country's changing cultural and political landscape. His work has appeared in The New York Times, The Village Voice, Los Angeles Times and Variety. People on social media pressed Alcaraz for an editorial cartoon in response to the Disney decision. He responded with ""Muerto Mouse."" On Tuesday, a petition went up on Change.org to stop the Disney effort, stating that the attempt to trademark Día de los Muertos was ""cultural appropriation and exploitation at its worst."" On Friday evening, the petition had more than 21,000 signatures. ""Our spiritual traditions are for everyone, not for companies like Walt Disney to trademark and exploit,"" wrote Grace Sesma, the petition's creator. ""I am deeply offended and dismayed that a family-oriented company like Walt Disney would seek to own the rights to something that is the rightful heritage of the people of Mexico."" In 2003, the Day of the Dead celebration was entered on the UNESCO list of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. ""The Indigenous Festivity dedicated to the Dead are deeply rooted in the cultural life of the indigenous peoples of Mexico,"" UNESCO told CNNMexico. But after the backlash, Disney withdrew its application this week. ""The trademark intended to protect any potential title of the movie or related activity,"" a spokeswoman for Disney told CNNMexico. ""Since then, it has been determined that the title of the film will change, and therefore we are withdrawing our application for trademark registration."" Disney did not comment on whether social media reactions directly led to the decision to withdraw the application. This isn't the first time Disney has sought to trademark a controversial phrase. In 2011, it tried to secure ""SEAL Team Six,"" the Navy SEAL team that captured and killed Osama bin Laden, seeking exclusive rights for use on items from video games to backpacks. However, after receiving an overwhelming response from critics, Disney withdrew the application ""out of deference to the Navy."" Alcaraz says this ""blunder"" wouldn't have happened if there were more people of color at large corporations. ""It's just frustrating because I've spoken to some of these companies begging them to have more people of color in the legal department, behind the camera and greenlighting projects, but they won't listen,"" Alcaraz said. ""And not just tokens. It's gotta be real."" Other companies and individuals have tried to trademark other Mexican symbols in the past, including Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico's national anthem, Montezuma's headdress, nopal (cactus) and tequila.","Disney filed a trademark application to secure the phrase ""Día de los Muertos""

"President Barack Obama underwent a routine CT scan Saturday afternoon while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because of a sore throat, according to the White House and his doctor. The president's doctor said the CT scan was normal and that Obama's symptoms ""are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux."" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the President was not sedated, so no transfer of authority was necessary. However, Vice President Joe Biden and other senior White House staffers ""were kept up to speed,"" Earnest said. The doctor's visit was not on the White House schedule for Saturday and reporters hustled to join the president's motorcade to Water Reed in Bethesda, Maryland. The president left the hospital 28 minutes after arriving. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Obama's physician, issued a statement: . ""This morning, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Fort Belvoir Medical Center conducted a fiber optic exam, under my supervision, of the President's throat based on symptoms of sore throat over the past couple weeks. The exam revealed soft tissue swelling in the posterior throat and I, in consultation with the specialist, determined that further evaluation with a routine CT scan was prudent. ""The CT scan was conducted this afternoon purely as a matter of convenience for the President's schedule. The CT scan was normal. The President's symptoms are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux and will be treated accordingly."" CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said acid reflux usually can be easily treated. ""A lot of times, it may just be dietary changes,"" he said. ""Sometimes, you want to give medicines to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach."" Gupta said he thought the CT scan was done ""out of an abundance of caution."" ""They brought in an ears, nose and throat doctor into the White House and placed a scope down the mouth and looking at  the back of throat to see what was causing his discomfort,"" he said. ""Typically, you just do that by sort of putting an anesthetic spray in the back of the throat, sometimes a sedation as well. ... Based on what they found there, they were concerned enough to go ahead and get a CT scan."" Asked whether the President is still smoking, Earnest replied that Obama quit with the assistance of nicotine gum. Obama visited Jackson for his periodic checkup in May. Jackson described Obama's overall health as ""excellent."" The checkup information, released in June,  was the third medical report released by the White House during Obama's presidency.","Obama is not sedated; no transfer of authority needed .

"Shortly after being given more time to weigh evidence in black teenager Michael Brown's fatal shooting, a Missouri grand jury heard from the man at the center of it -- Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson -- a local newspaper reported. Wilson shot and killed the 19-year-old Brown in the middle of the day on August 9, in the middle of a street in the St. Louis suburb. Authorities could have charged Wilson themselves by filing a criminal complaint, but St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch instead opted to present the case to a grand jury that could indict the officer, or not. On Wednesday, Wilson testified for almost four hours in front of the seven men and five women on that grand jury, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, citing a source with knowledge of the investigation. The same source cited by the paper claimed that the Ferguson police officer, who was put on paid administrative leave after the shooting, has been ""cooperative"" in his two conversations with St. Louis County investigators and one with federal investigators. In addition to the county's case, the U.S. Justice Department has launched its own civil rights investigation into the shooting. Unlike many other aspects of the legal system, grand jury proceedings are closed to the public. Their mission is not to decide -- unanimously -- if there's evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to convict someone on a charge, as is the case with a criminal jury. Rather in Missouri, nine grand jurors -- or three-fourths of the total -- have to agree there is sufficient probable cause to charge someone with a crime. How the grand jury works . The fact that grand jury proceedings are secret has irked Brown's camp, many of whom accuse McCulloch of being too cozy with law enforcement. They question his commitment to pressing a case against Wilson, who is white, for the shooting of a young African-American man. The late teen's supporters have demanded Wilson be charged, accusing him of shooting the unarmed Brown when his hands were up. Meanwhile, Wilson's backers -- including a radio caller  identifying herself as Josie, who recounted his purported version of events -- claimed that the officer only fired after the larger Brown struggled with, taunted and then ran at him. There was no guarantee that Wilson would get the chance to tell a grand jury his side of the story. The defense doesn't present a case in these proceedings, which are run by prosecutors. ""Usually an accused will not be invited to testify,""  Neil Bruntrager, a criminal defense lawyer and general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officer Association, told CNN in August. ""But I would expect, in a case like this, that an invitation would be extended to him."" Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting . So how will this all shake out? What will the grand jury of nine whites and three African-Americans decide? Will they indict Wilson, or will they clear him? The public may not find out anytime soon. On August 20 -- when mobs of protesters were still regularly hitting the streets of Ferguson demanding Wilson's arrest and, at times, clashing with law enforcement -- McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that ""the aspirational time is by mid-October to have everything completed."" And they could have more time, if they need it, than that. St. Louis County Judge Carolyn Whittington has extended the grand jury's deadline until January 7, Paul Fox, the county's director of judicial administration, told CNN this week.","Post-Dispatch: Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson testifies for almost four hours .

"Sen. Mary Landrieu grew hoarse on the campaign trail Saturday. The Louisiana Democrat had been shouting all week, rallying her supporters at campaign events up and down the state, fighting to hold off a challenge from Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy to the bitter end. ""The national race is over, but honey, our race is not over"" she cried at a campaign rally on the eve of the runoff election. But there was every indication that nobody's listening. Saturday morning, when she arrives to vote, only four cameras are there to capture the moment, compared with what one staffer described as a gaggle 50-strong during the November 4 vote. Landrieu has trailed in every public poll of the race. Most recently, in a poll out this week from Republican firm WPA Research, she was down by 24 points. Early voting among African-Americans, a voting bloc key to her chances for a win, was down, but Republican early voting was up. With Republicans locking down control of the Senate in the November elections, Louisiana lost some of its urgency for national Democrats. The National Democratic Senatorial Committee withdrew its investment early on in the runoff and left her to fend for herself, as did most of the major Democratic spending groups. The lopsided fight frustrates Landrieu, who on Friday, unprompted, chastised the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for having ""abandoned us."" ""I just don't believe in leaving a soldier on the field, and that's what they did,"" she says. Landrieu tries to turn the tide . Even on Saturday morning, Landrieu insisted despite the lack of support, she still had a chance, noting there's a precedent for her to orchestrate an unexpected, come-from-behind win. ""The first race I ran 18 years ago -- the same pundits said, the tide has turned, you cannot win, no Democrat can win in the South. Eighteen years ago they said that, and we did"" win, Landrieu remembers. In 2002, too, she pulled off a runoff win. Then, like now, she seized on a niche issue -- then it was a trade deal that would hurt farmers in the state, now it's a dispute over Cassidy's work for Louisiana State University -- to help boost her campaign in its last moments. But this time, Louisiana political observers say the issue broke too late for it to gain much traction. And the political tides have grown increasingly difficult for the senator during her time in office. The South has become increasingly red, and Landrieu is now the last remaining statewide elected Democrat in Louisiana, and the last Democratic senator in the Deep South. President Barack Obama remains deeply unpopular in Louisiana, and Republicans have successfully made the race a referendum on him, even as Landrieu focuses on her record. GOP candidate keeps low-profile in past weeks . Landrieu confronts mission impossible . Still, it's probably a good thing for Cassidy that few were listening to the race. The congressman has been described as ""awkward"" and ""really weird"" by the press and his detractors. He's kept his campaign appearances to a minimum in the runoff -- spending nearly all of the last week of the campaign in Washington -- to reduce the chances, many speculate, that his unusual personal style could stymie his near-certain win. That style is on full display during one of his two final campaign rallies on Friday. Out front of the event, he escalates to an unexpected, gleeful shout while thanking a supporter for voting for him. Telling a reporter that the reason Republicans have gained so much strength in the South is the fact that ""they're the party for working families,"" citing the GOP's support of the Keystone XL pipeline as an example, and he points a finger to the sky and raises his chin as though sermonizing. Deflecting a question on why he hasn't been in the state all week, Cassidy tangles himself in the kinds of knots that have wound up in Democratic attack ads. ""It is the story that I'm doing my job as a congressman -- because people want to question me as to whether or not I'm doing my job as a doctor -- I've always shown up wherever I've been asked to be. And when I show up where I'm asked where I'm supposed to be is now a story ... because people ask me what,"" he says. Cassidy pauses, then adds: ""You see the paradox."" Asked about the evaluation made by others of his personal style, Cassidy brushes them off as unfounded bias from reporters who ""read what other reporters have said and they write what the other reporters have said."" Cassidy takes Election Day off . Democrats are already starting to look past her loss Saturday toward 2016 as an opportunity to right the ship. Mitch Landrieu, the senator's brother and mayor of New Orleans, told a group of reporters Friday night that as soon as they start focusing on 2016, the ""environment is going to start changing all across America."" ""On Monday morning, the whole story's gonna be different,"" Mitch Landrieu promised a group of reporters during Landrieu's Friday night event. He later added, ""There's always another day.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Always short of time? Not enough moments in the day? Tonight you'll get an extra second to enjoy 2008. Use it wisely; perhaps an extra long smooch is called for. An extra second will be added to 2008 to align clocks with variations in the Earth's time. Immediately before midnight a leap second -- the first for three years -- will be added to atomic clocks around the world by official timekeepers. Peter Whibberley, a senior research scientist at Britain's National Physical Laboratory, said the Earth's erratic rotation meant an extra second needed to be added. ""The difference between atomic time and Earth time has now built up to the point where it needs to be corrected, so this New Year's Eve we will experience a rare 61 second minute at the very end of 2008 and revelers... will have an extra second to celebrate."" Traditionally time has been based on the passage of the Sun across the sky -- a modern version of this is still used by astronomers to track distant stars and spacecraft. However, since 1967, an atomic timescale -- the extremely accurate Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) -- has been the world's official clock and is used for broadcasting time signals across the world. The accuracy of UTC is essential for the smooth running of the Internet. By comparison, the Earth is far less reliable. It does not rotate at a constant speed -- it can even wobble -- and disruptions to its core, extreme weather, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can influence the length of a day. Therefore, leap seconds are occasionally added to align atomic time with astronomical time and ensure that the Sun remains overhead at noon. Whibberley told British media anyone sober enough and who had a digital clock that picked up leap second information from a reliable source, would see the final seconds of 2008 as 57, 58, 59, 60, 00 -- with 60 being the extra second.","A leap second will be added to atomic clocks on New Year's Eve .

"Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki has ordered a ""face-to-face audit"" at all Department of Veterans Affairs clinics, a spokeswoman told CNN on Thursday. Earlier in the day, the House Veterans Affairs Committee voted to subpoena Shinseki in the wake of accusations that his department is responsible for deadly delays in health care at some of its hospitals. The Shinseki subpoena will cover e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list, first reported by CNN, of veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix VA hospital. VA scheduler in Texas: I was ordered to 'cook the books' The House panel agreed to issue the subpoena in a verbal vote Thursday morning. Shinseki will testify May 15 before the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, CNN also learned. Attention on the secretary follows months of CNN exclusive reporting about U.S. veterans who have died while they waited for treatment at VA hospitals across the country. CNN has submitted numerous requests for an interview with Shinseki; the secretary has refused them all. On May 1, Shinseki issued a written statement announcing that the director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system and two others have been placed on administrative leave amid claims of a secret waiting list and allegations that 40-plus veterans died waiting for care. ""We believe it is important to allow an independent, objective review to proceed,"" Shinseki wrote. ""These allegations, if true, are absolutely unacceptable and if the Inspector General's investigation substantiates these claims, swift and appropriate action will be taken."" Phoenix VA officials deny secret wait list; doctors say they're lying . Shinseki told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he would not resign over the allegations. ""I serve at the pleasure of the president,"" Shinseki told the newspaper when asked whether he would step down. ""I signed on to make some changes. I have work to do."" The plans to conduct an audit come after Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona wrote to Shinseki, urging a nationwide audit of the scheduling system currently used at VA medical facilities. A news release from Kirkpatrick said the letter was being circulated among her House colleagues. Read Kirkpatrick's letter to Shinseki (PDF) At a White House daily briefing Tuesday, press secretary Jay Carney said that President Obama takes seriously the allegations that veterans died waiting for care at the Phoenix VA hospital, Carney said. He repeated that the VA's inspector general is conducting an independent investigation into the allegations. On Thursday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest echoed Carney's comments, telling reporters that Obama still has ""complete confidence"" in Shinseki. And House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday that he is ""not ready to join the chorus of people calling for (Shinseki) to step down,"" calling ""the problems at the VA ... systemic."" On Tuesday, Shinseki said on NPR that he was determined to find out whether the allegations are true. ""Allegations like this get my attention,"" Shinseki said. ""I take it seriously, and my habit is to get to the bottom of it. ""If allegations are substantiated, we'll take swift and appropriate action."" On Monday, the American Legion, the nation's largest veterans organization, and another veterans group, Concerned Veterans for America, called for Shinseki's resignation. The national commander of the American Legion said the group's call for Shinseki's ouster is a very serious gesture. ""It's not something we do lightly. But we do so today because it is our responsibility as advocate for the men and women who have worn this nation's uniform,"" said Daniel M. Dellinger. Pete Hegseth, CEO of the Concerned Veterans of America, offered a statement: ""We're proud to stand with The American Legion as they take this courageous and historic stand. As America's largest veterans organization, their moral authority on this issue is unimpeachable. We applaud their demands for accountability at the very top of the Department of Veterans Affairs.""","Obama still has ""complete confidence"" in Shinseki, spokesman says .

"Passengers aboard a sinking South Korean ferry faced a terrifying choice as the vessel rolled: obey commands barked over loudspeakers to stay in place, or don life vests and jump into the chilly ocean water. ""Don't move,"" a voice warned, according to a recording obtained by CNN affiliate YTN. ""If you move, it's dangerous. Don't move."" That announcement, some witnesses worried, may have cost some passengers on the ferry Sewol their lives. ""Kids were forced to stay put,"" one survivor told CNN affiliate YTN, ""so only some of those who moved survived."" As rescuers searched the frigid water for nearly 300 people who remained unaccounted for, witnesses told horrific stories of their final minutes on the sinking ship. ""We were told to stay where you are, so we kept staying,"" survivor Hyun Hung Chang told YTN. ""But later on, the water level came up. So we were beside ourselves. Kids were screaming out of terror, shouting for help."" At least some of those who jumped or made their way to the top of the ship were rescued. Helicopter crews plucked some from the deck. Others were pulled from the water by rescuers aboard the multitude of fishing boats and military vessels that raced to the scene as the ship rolled over and capsized. ""I had to swim a bit to get to the boat to be rescued,"" Lim Hyung Min, one of more than 300 Seoul high school students who was aboard the ship for a four-day field trip, told CNN affiliate YTN. ""The water was so cold and I wanted to live."" Nine have been confirmed dead, officials said Thursday. As of 10:45 a.m. (9:45 p.m. ET Wednesday), of the 475 people who were aboard the ferry when it capsized, there were 287 people missing, and 179 people had been rescued, the coast guard said. Police are questioning the boat's captain, and maritime police are investigating safety and rescue conditions aboard the ferry, YTN reported. The captain had few words for the public. ""I'm sorry, I have nothing to say,"" the captain said, according to South Korean TV network JTBC. A massive rescue operation resumed early Thursday after a delay of several hours, the South Korean Coast Guard told CNN. The reason for the delay was unclear. Dozens of military divers, sailors, marines and police officers were assisting in the effort. But cold water, swift currents and low visibility appeared to be complicating the rescue operation. Water temperatures in the area are between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 10 to 13 degrees Celsius), CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Helicopters took off from the U.S. Navy ship USS Bonhomme Richard Thursday to support search efforts, said Lt. Arlo Abrahamson, spokesman for the U.S. Navy in South Korea. The U.S. ship also has divers aboard who could help with searching if South Korea's government requests it, he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""From the images that I've seen, there's clearly some areas of the hull that are above the water, that are not flooded,"" Mike Dean, the U.S. Navy deputy director for salvage and diving, told ""CNN Tonight."" ""So absolutely, there could be areas in there where there is breathable air, but the trouble right now is the temperature and getting people to them."" Rescuers are ""up against every sort of obstacle,"" said David Gallo, director of special projects at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. ""It's just an absolutely, positively horrific situation,"" he said. ""It's nightmarish."" 'We are not dead yet' passengers texted . A tilt and a bang . It began as a routine ocean trip on calm seas. Passengers bound for a resort island were just stirring, some eating breakfast. The ship ran into trouble just before 9 a.m. as it steamed toward to Jeju, a resort island considered the Hawaii of Korea. Passenger Kim Sung-Mook told YTN that he was eating breakfast in the ship's main hall when he felt the ferry begin to tilt. Someone made the announcement telling passengers to stay in place. Then, he said, he heard a loud bang. Lim, the rescued student, told YTN he heard the bang before the ship began to list. The tremors knocked shipping containers off balance, he said. ""The students were falling over and crashing into things and bleeding,"" Lim said. Many passengers screamed. He obeyed orders to stay on the ship until rescuers arrived, threw him a life jacket and told him to jump. The water, he said, was ""unbearably cold."" Cell phone video believed to have been taken from inside the ferry shows people wearing life jackets and waiting. At first, survivor Ji Chul Song said she listened to orders to stay put. ""But suddenly, the water came up to my face,"" she told YTN. ""So I think it was a narrow escape from dying."" Can they survive in air pockets? Why were passengers told to stay put? The warning over the ferry's loudspeakers may have put passengers' lives at risk, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""I think the instruction for those people to remain in place and not get on lifeboats was terribly, tragically wrong,"" she said. Kim Petersen, governor emeritus of the Maritime Security Council, said that when crew members aboard the ship issued that warning, it might have been the best course of action. ""The master of the ship, the captain, may well have determined that the vessel was going to remain level and might sink at a steady rate that would allow for the safe exit of people off of the vessel using life rafts, for example, and that would be the preferred way to go,"" he said. ""It may well be that the announcement was made while the captain was under the impression that the vessel was not going to sink quickly. And that events overtook their ability to communicate a change in direction to the passengers."" Massive damage? What caused the ship to sink is unknown. It capsized within two hours of its first distress call, which came just before 9 a.m., Yonhap reported . Peter Boynton, a retired U.S. Coast Guard captain, said the speed with which the ship sank suggested it had sustained ""major damage."" It most likely struck something in the water, Boynton said. Making matters worse, the ferry carried dozens of vehicles. Once an auto deck is breached, ""it's typically open to very significant flooding,"" Boynton said. That could explain ""why the ferry in just a matter of hours began to roll onto its side so quickly."" As authorities searched for answers, heartbroken family members of the missing gathered in Jindo, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the site where the ferry sank. Desperation turned to anger for some, who accused authorities of not doing enough. Coast guard boats took some family members clamoring for answers out to the site of the shipwreck early Thursday. One mother shared a text message she said her son apparently sent hours after the ferry sunk. ""Can't see a thing, it's totally dark,"" the message said. ""We are not dead yet, so please send along this message."" Survivors tell of panic on board as ferry tilts, then capsizes .","Ferry captain: ""I'm sorry, I have nothing to say,"" JTBC reports .

"Los Angeles police are investigating a sexual assault claim against Bill Cosby, a police spokeswoman said Friday. The woman is a ""possible victim"" of sexual assault by Bill Cosby, Officer Jane Kim said, adding it is an open case but declining further comment. Cosby is coming under increasing scrutiny as more and more women accuse him of sexual misconduct. At least 21 women have made claims against him in recent weeks. The 77-year-old comedian and actor has vehemently denied most of the accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted young women. He has never been charged with a crime. One of the latest accusations comes from former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten, who says there are 12 more ex-bunnies with similar stories who don't want to come forward. Masten told CNN's Alisyn Camerota that Cosby drugged and raped her at a Chicago hotel. She said she told her supervisor soon afterward and was told no one would believe her because Cosby and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner were good friends. Hefner responded to the allegations in a statement Friday, saying ""Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved."" The new accusations could further sully the reputation of Cosby -- the man behind children's programming such as ""Fat Albert"" and ""Little Bill,"" and whose eponymous No. 1 sitcom, ""The Cosby Show,"" cast him as a wisecracking, doting family man.","Police: The woman is a ""possible victim"" of sexual assault by Cosby .

""But we did not expect that a storm surge would be coming and take all our family away. We were not given information that a great wave would come."" Tragically, only six of his family members were ever found -- and they're now buried close to his modest home. It's difficult to look Joseph in the eyes. It's impossible to understand what he has been through. Escaping the coast . A year on and what remains of his family are leaving their homes to move inland to stay with relatives. ""I've been following developments on the radio this time,"" he said. ""The government is now providing better information. I'm scared but at least I know what is going on. Yesterday, the mayor visited us and told us to vacate our homes for our safety."" Tacloban's mayor, Alfred Romualdez, has ordered the forced evacuation of several coastal ""barangays,"" or neighborhoods as a precaution -- hundreds of people. These areas are usually made up of rudimentary shacks -- exactly the type of structures washed away during Haiyan -- owned by many of the area's poorest residents. The local police are now doing sweeps of the area ensuring that people comply, with women and children being prioritized and taken to dozens of evacuation centers around the area -- part of a massive operation across the country that has seen almost half a million people in the path of storm moved to safety, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). ""When I took the decision a few days ago to close schools, people questioned me. But now they realize I wanted students to have time to return to their families in other areas so that they could prepare properly,"" said Romualdez. He said one of the biggest problems last year was the sheer volume of people they had to help. ""Many were coming in from outside Tacloban and saying they were from here,"" he said. ""When we asked them which barangay they came from, they said 'Barangay 19 or 23!' But when we asked the barangay captain if he knew them, he'd often say no. ""But for humanitarian reasons, we'd have to shelter them. But we could only do this for a day or so then send them away."" City subdued ahead of storm . It's now Saturday morning and the center of Tacloban should usually be a bustling hub of activity, the scene is eerie. Barely a handful of people are on the streets, with most businesses shuttered. The few shops that remain open seem to have plentiful supplies on their shelves, and no real queues to speak of. Everyone seems more organized. People respect what they're being told. Haiyan is all too fresh in the memory. Like many others people in Tacloban, it took Joseph months to rebuild his home -- and his life -- after such an appalling tragedy. Sadly he expects to rebuild his home once again if the storm reaches anything like the velocity it did a year ago. Even if Hagupit -- known as Ruby here -- hits further north as current predictions suggest, the sheer size of it will be felt here in Tacloban. Joseph seems resigned to this. ""We're sad. We fear this typhoon will destroy everything again,"" he said. ""We're still rebuilding and now another typhoon is coming."" Asked if he's considered moving away from an area prone to these kind of destructive storms, he replied: ""No, I can't do anything because my life is here. I work on the sea. ""But now we're willing to evacuate when we hear about these storms."" And that is the biggest difference between this year and last.","Fisherman Joseph Pedrero lost 11 family members during Haiyan last year .

"Conjoined twins born at an Atlanta hospital have died, their parents said, less than two days after they beat the odds simply by coming into the world. Eli and Asa Hamby shared a torso, heart, arms and legs. They had separate spinal columns to support their heads. Doctors at Atlanta's Northside Hospital delivered the boys Thursday morning, then transferred them to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, parents Michael and Robin Hamby wrote on their Facebook page, where they posted frequent updates on their boys. Late Friday, the parents posted a tearful video in which they announced their boys had died that evening. ""They fought long and hard,"" Michael Hamby said. ""They (were) doing real good last night, had no problems other than little breathing problems. ... They was holding their own, and early this morning they started to have heart issues."" He said one side of their heart was beating more quickly than the other and the heart rate reached 300 beats per minute, despite medicine to try to bring it down. Staff then sedated the boys and doctors allowed Robin, still recovering from her cesarean section, to leave her hospital bed to be with them. ""We sang to the boys and prayed over them, and our families got to love on them and tell them how much we love them,"" Robin said in the video. ""They took them off the ventilators, and about 45 minutes (later), Eli and Asa went on to sleep, to be with the Lord,"" Michael said. Births of conjoined twins are rare, happening once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 40-60% of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35% survive only one day. The overall survival rate of conjoined twins is between 5% and 25%. The Hambys are from near Phenix City, Alabama, and have a daughter, Selah, who is almost 2. ""It's hard losing two kids at one time,"" Michael said. ""Even though I only got to be with them a little over 24 hours, it feels like a lifetime. I don't wish this hurt on anybody."" Robin called the boys ""beautiful"" and had said late Thursday they were even offering glimpses of their different personalities. Pictures on Facebook showed the parents beaming as they held their babies, swaddled tightly with hats on their heads. ""They looked so much like Michael. They were just the cutest little things. They were so, so sweet,"" Robin said. The parents said their Christian faith had grown stronger ever since the boys came into their lives. ""I know they're in heaven and they're waiting on me,"" Michael said. ""God is good."" Said Robin, ""God gave us extra time with them that some parents don't get to have, because a lot of babies are stillborn that are conjoined twins, and we had almost two days.""","Alabama parents chronicle rare pregnancy on social media .

"Brimfield Township Police Chief David Oliver keeps a picture of John Wayne in his office, but admits it's hard to know what the Duke would say about a self-described old-school cop using Facebook to sound off about enforcing the law in a small Ohio town. ""I'd like to think he'd appreciate that we're communicating effectively with people,"" Oliver said. ""But have a low tolerance for nonsense."" The police chief has earned national headlines for poking fun at so-called mopes, or suspected criminals, on his department's Facebook page. Oliver's candid comments have made it the third most viewed police department page in the United States, according to Nancy Kolb, senior program manager for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. With more than 64,000 likes, it trails only the New York City Police Department and the Boston Police Department. ""Up and at 'em. It's 65 degrees outside of the Center for Mope Studies,"" Oliver wrote in a typical post this week. The chair of Brimfield's board of trustees says Oliver's teasing of criminals is in good fun, while criminal justice experts say it falls in a gray area between traditional practices and the unethical. Oliver launched the Facebook page in 2010, after viewing a couple police department pages and deciding one would fit into his management philosophy, which is to try to run the department like a business and serve the community from within. He and his staff of 16 full-time officers say they want social media to work for those they serve. ""If our customers are on Facebook and Twitter, we have to be there engaging them,"" said Oliver, who spoke by phone from Brimfield. ""The more we communicate, the more we inform, the less people are suspicious of us."" 'It takes away the moral high ground' Brimfield Township is a suburb of Kent, Ohio, with a population of more than 10,000 that is growing rapidly again after being hit hard by years of economic downturn, said Mike Kostensky, the chairman of its board of trustees. He has known Oliver for 12 years. ""Dave has such a way with words,"" Kostensky said. ""He makes people comfortable. His office is open to anybody. I guess it's a little bit of how small town America used to be."" But not everyone sees productive humor in Oliver's Facebook discussions. Steven Lab, a professor of criminal justice and chairman of the Department of Human Services at Bowling Green State University, says Oliver's posts only deepen the divide between authorities and people who are suspicious of the system, but are often the most in need of its help. ""It takes away the moral high ground of whoever is supposed to be in charge,"" Lab said. ""It's going to raise more disrespect."" Oliver disagrees. He got the term ""mope"" from the 1970s police show ""Kojak,"" and stresses his teasing of suspects is just a part of what he posts. ""A mope is a person who leeches off us and usually is engaged in criminal activity,"" Oliver wrote recently. ""We do not believe everyone who has ever committed a crime is a mope. People change."" On June 20, the police chief likened the Brimfield police station to a ship in the U.S. Navy. ""It's 54 degrees outside of Mope-us Interruptus,"" he wrote in a post that also thanked World War II veterans, wished singer Lionel Richie happy birthday and quoted comedian Jay Leno. Sometimes, Oliver details calls to police and their response. ""I think that as a society we have become desensitized,"" he said. ""I'm trying to keep a lot of the criminal element in plain view, so we can address some of the causes and the results of the crime."" 'I just don't get along well with criminals' Lab, who doesn't use Facebook and had not viewed the Brimfield page, said now that it has gone viral, it no longer serves its intended purpose because the majority of its audience is in no way connected with Brimfield. ""It's titillating,"" he said of the page's surge in popularity. ""It's morbid voyeurism by people in general."" Molly Merryman, associate chair of sociology in the Criminology and Justice Studies program at Kent State University, which is about 15 minutes from Brimfield, says social media plays an increased role in informing communities like Brimfield that are not connected to a major media market. ""He's been a chief for a long time and knows his community very well,"" she said. If the Facebook page is ""an extension of the police department and has the community's blessing, then it certainly can be appropriate."" Merryman said the U.S. criminal justice system has a long history of public shaming that can be traced to the Puritans. Shaming is still commonly used in the juvenile justice system, where the goal is to make the violator recognize society's expectation for proper behavior, she said. Oliver said that while what he posts about alleged criminals is public record, he never uses names, pictures or exact locations when discussing suspects' purported actions. ""I don't want anybody humiliated,"" he said. ""I'm very sensitive to collateral damage by people who commit crimes and I don't want a family member suffering."" According to the FBI, in 2011, approximately one crime was reported for every 36 people living in Brimfield Township. Almost 96% of reported crimes were property crimes, of which larceny and theft made up 80%. Brimfield Township reported no murders or homicides in 2011, and a total of 12 violent crimes, half of which were rape. A native of nearby Akron, Ohio, Oliver has spent his entire 19 years as a police officer working in Brimfield, the last nine as chief. ""I'm an inner-city kid,"" he said. ""I did my share of running the streets. ... I don't see color. I don't see sex. I have friends of all persuasions. I just don't get along well with criminals.""","The Brimfield Facebook page is the third most liked police page in the United States .

"Users of Grindr, the leading gay hookup app, have voted Hillary Clinton their ""Straight Ally of the Year."" The former secretary of state joins a slate of other noteworthy figures highlighted in Grindr's 'Best of Awards' for 2014, including Neil Patrick Harris (voted ""Gay Icon of the Year"" for the second year in a row) and Vladimir Putin (voted ""Enemy of the LGBT Community""). While Clinton's team has not responded to request for comment, it seems likely she would welcome the positive reaction from Grindr's gay users. Clinton did not publicly support same-sex marriage until last year, after she stepped down as secretary of state. During a testy interview with National Public Radio this summer, she said she couldn't wade into politics while serving in what is supposed to be an apolitical position and, before that, to her upbringing to explain her lack of support for same-sex marriage. ""I did not grow up even imagining gay marriage and I don't think you probably did either,"" Clinton told NPR's Terry Gross. ""This was an incredibly new and important idea that people on the front lines of the gay rights movement began to talk about and slowly but surely convinced others of the rightness of that position. And when I was ready to say what I said, I said it,"" Clinton said, pushing back on the suggestion that she supported same-sex marriage but was waiting for it to be politically advantageous position to take. Grindr users ""Biggest prediction for 2015"" is that Clinton will announce her presidential campaign, a move that is all but certain now that Clinton's timeline for an announcement appears to be slipping toward the spring. It's not a scientific poll, to be clear, though a representative for the site did point out to CNN that what was supposed to be a joke poll of Grindr users on whether Scotland would vote for independence from the United Kingdom turned out to be just 1 percentage point off the actual vote, a more accurate result than actual pollsters reported the night before Scots went to the ballots.","Grindr users have named Hillary Clinton their ""Straight Ally of the Year""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy is having hundreds of its older F/A-18 fighter jets inspected, including some flying operations over Afghanistan, for cracks in part of a wing assembly, officials said Friday. Inspectors looking at F/A-18 fighter jets have found 15 with stress crack problems on the wings. Some 636 F/A-18 A through D model Hornets in both the Navy and the Marine Corps are being inspected for stress cracks on a hinge connecting the aileron to the flaps on the back side of the wings, according to Navy spokesmen. Inspectors started looking at the planes Thursday and have found 15 aircrafts with the problem. A panel on the wing can be swapped out with a new one to get rid of the problem. The Navy is still looking at the hinge in question to see whether the problem is severe enough to ground the Hornets and come up for a permanent fix for the hinge. Navy officials said there are no immediate plans to ground the 636 planes. This month, a post-flight inspection of one F/A-18 found a crack, and it was determined to be systemic enough to warrant an inspection of the older F/A-18s, according to Navy officials. The Navy also flies the Super Hornet, a newer version of the F/A-18. That plane is not part of this inspection. Navy flight operations around the world will not be interrupted because of the inspections, officials said.","636 F/A-18 A through D model Hornets being inspected for stress crack .

"New York (CNN) -- Eric Garner's mother Saturday urged the thousands of demonstrators who have taken to streets throughout nation in protest of her son's death to ""keep on doing it, but do it in peace."" Gwen Carr, who appeared at a Harlem rally with the family lawyer of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, said a demonstration the other day left her stuck in traffic on the West Side Highway in Manhattan. A protester recognized her and hugged her and ""everybody else followed,"" she said. ""My heart is overflowing with joy,"" she said. Esaw Garner Snipes, Garner's widow, told the crowd that watching thousands of demonstrators from the window of her Staten Island, New York, home brought tears to her eyes. She said she told her son, ""Look at all the love your father is getting."" They spoke at a weekly rally held by the activist Rev. Al Sharpton, who will lead a march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House next Saturday in an attempt to take the issue of racially uneven justice in America from ""moment to movement."" After the rally, Garner's family and others gathered for a wreath-laying ceremony on the Staten Island street where he died. ""The spirit of God is moving upon the masses to make a change,"" Kevin Buford, who was Garner's friend, said at the site of the ceremony. ""I think there is going to be a change coming. Too many young men have died without no accountability."" Garner's sister, Ellisha Flagg, spoke under a cold, steady rain of the importance of police officers knowing the communities they serve. ""I never believed we would be here like this,"" she said, standing near the spot where her brother died. Saturday was the fourth day of marches, sit-ins and die-ins over a grand jury decision not to indict the police officer who put the 43-year-old Garner in a chokehold during the fatal July 17 incident. Many people around the country have been as shocked by the decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who put Garner in a chokehold, as they were when the cell phone video of it went viral. The outrage has weighed especially heavy after the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. When the grand jury in St. Louis County announced it would not indict Officer Darren Wilson in Brown's death, protests dotted the American map. Likewise in the Garner case. On Saturday, dozens of protesters staged ""die ins"" -- laying down on the ground in memory of Garner -- at Grand Central Station in Manhattan and Union Station in Washington. Protesters also planned to gather at Union Square in Manhattan on Saturday evening. ""Our country really needs to begin to evaluate, particularly ... white people, the assumptions we make about what is happening in the black community,"" Judi Flournoy, a Los Angeles resident participating in the New York protest. ""What's happening in these cities in these last several days is incredibly important to show we have a unified voice."" In Oakland, California, red taillights snaked for hundreds of yards down an interstate Friday, as motorists stopped for protesters blocking traffic for a few minutes. A coast away, in New York City, protesters attempted to block traffic on FDR Drive -- a six-lane thoroughfare that hugs eastern Manhattan -- and on the iron-trellised Manhattan Bridge, which connects the island to Brooklyn. But at the end of a long, cold, wet Friday, police had had enough and pulled up in detention buses. The sight of them alone was a deterrent to most protesters. After a handful were arrested, the remaining group called it a night. New York multitudes . Nowhere in the country have streets overflowed with as many outraged people as in New York City. Friday's crowds appeared to be smaller than on previous nights, as cold rain trickled down jackets and hats. But marchers were still passionate about being heard. Some passed out a list of demands to the media regarding Garner's death. All officers involved should be fired, they demanded, and a special prosecutor should investigate complaints of excessive force. The state legislature should make chokeholds punishable. Earlier, Eric Garner's daughter, Erica, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that she wanted to see people punished for her father's killing. ""Justice to me is basically doing what's right,"" she said. ""I wouldn't be happy with (Pantaleo) just losing his job or being suspended or still getting paid. I wouldn't want that. I would want him to face time in jail."" She said that anyone who contributed to her father's death should go to prison. Christmas tree die-ins . At Herald Square, where Broadway cuts an elegantly slanted path through streets and avenues to create a picturesque gathering place, protesters flooded Macy's century-old flagship store -- a national historic landmark. Store management allowed them to stage a die-in under the eyes of holiday shoppers and ceilings decked with Christmas cheer. They marched up a few blocks to Times Square and blocked traffic for 10 minutes, then turned down 42nd Street chanting, ""This is what democracy looks like."" They stopped again in Bryant Park and encircled some shops. Many of the workers in those stores came out and, in support, raised their hands in the air. The crowd set off up Sixth Avenue, traversing against the flow of yellow cabs and other cars. A cacophony of horns greeted them, and cab drivers held their hands out of their windows in approval. Chuck Helms, 67 and white, clad in a union-issue hard hat and satin Occupy Wall Street jacket, wore a sign around his neck. ""Remembering my brothers. BLACK LIVES MATTER,"" it read. The faces of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Akai Gurley -- all black men whose controversial deaths made headlines -- looked out from photos. Helms said, ""It's a shame that people have to die for us to become focused."" All over America . Protests dotted the American map, and crowds were diverse. Signs floated over the heads of crowds reading ""Black lives matter"" in North Carolina, Ohio, California and Louisiana. On Saturday, police in Durham, North Carolina, reported the discovery of an undetonated explosive device -- described as a ""bottle with a wick and an apparent petroleum-based liquid"" -- near a protest area. The night before, 31 people were arrested after about 100 protesters shut down several streets in downtown Durham, police said. It was personal for a young black man in Washington who held a sign reading, ""I could be next."" Students lay down on campus walkways for dozens of yards in a die-in at Emory University in Atlanta on Friday. Protesters lay on the streets of Washington in the darkness for 4Â½ minutes, symbolizing the 4Â½ hours the body of Michael Brown lay on a Ferguson street. ""I'm not an angry black man. I'm an outraged, hurt black man,"" one protest organizer there said. Marchers in Massachusetts, Memphis . Near Boston -- site of one of the largest demonstrations of the night -- several dozen people blocked an intersection by lying on the road. About 1,000 people marched Friday evening from Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, to Harvard Square, according to a police estimate. ""People who don't already realize what is happening, maybe they will open their minds a little bit, or people that do realize and don't care will realize that people are angry and it's not OK,"" a protesting woman told CNN affiliate WHDH. In Chicago, Elizabeth Huston, a paralegal, joined in for the first time. ""So many people realize this is a problem. This is disproportionally affecting black men and women,"" she said. Cleveland cop who shot 12-year-old slammed for 'immaturity' in past job . In Cleveland, marchers protested the death of Tamir Rice, 12, who police say had a lifelike air gun and didn't comply with an officer's commands. ""CPD what do you say? How many kids have you killed today,"" they yelled. The boy's family on Friday filed a wrongful death suit against police, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. At a historic spot in the history of American civil rights, at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center in Memphis, Tennessee, a dozen or more people sprawled out on a walkway. Feet away was the second-floor motel balcony, where an assassin's bullet stuck down King, the quintessential figure of the American civil rights movement, in 1968. Brooklyn DA: Grand jury to investigate shooting of unarmed man . Reported improvements . Meanwhile, New York officials said complaints against police officers had fallen significantly in the second half of the year, compared with July to November 2013. A report that tallied complaints said 1,813 were made so far since July 1 of this year, 26% fewer than the number of complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board in the same period of the prior year. Excessive force allegations fell by 29%. The dip followed a slight rise in the first six months of the year, the report said, but, overall, allegations have declined in 2014.

"Israel will soon have new elections, after its Prime Minister called for the dismissal of two critical members of his coalition Cabinet and announced he'd call for the dissolution of the nation's legislature, his office announced Tuesday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered letters of dismissal for Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, two members of his Cabinet from rival parties, according to a statement from his office. ""During the last few weeks and, in particular, the last few days, the ministers have intensely attacked the government that I am leading,"" Netanyahu said. ""... I will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government."" Bad timing? The moves come at a tenuous time in Israel, which has been beset by a number of recent terrorist attacks against citizens in Jerusalem. The head of the right-wing Likud party, Netanyahu has been Israel's Prime Minister since 2009. But he's had to rely on members of other parties -- many of them to the left of Likud on the political spectrum -- to govern. His Likud party, for instance, won more seats than any other party in the January 2013 election, but still fell well short of the 60 needed to have a majority in the Knesset. He ended up bringing on other parties into his government. The first to join was ""The Movement,"" a centrist party led by Livni, a former opposition leader and foreign minister. Yapid -- a charismatic journalist-turned-politician -- became another key player, after his centrist Yesh Atid party finished a surprising second in that national election. 'Debate, contradictions, ultimatums' Netanyahu told reporters Tuesday a divided government was one of Israel's problems, saying there was a lot of debate, contradictions and ultimatums. He called out Livni for meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas against his recommendation and for criticizing building in Jerusalem, which some say has exacerbated tensions with Arabs there. And Netanyahu lambasted Lapid for calling Israel's boycott of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's U.N. speech a mistake and challenging his push to label Israel a Jewish state, which some fear will alienate the country's significant Arab population. He also accused the ministers of being behind talks ""to kick out the prime minister."" ""In one word, they call this a putsch,"" Netanyahu said. ""You cannot have a government like this. It's impossible to govern like this."" In a Facebook post Tuesday, Livni said, ""The question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means, but who will deal with the threats in a responsible, level headed manner for the good of the country."" Political party reacts . Yesh Atid also fired back in a statement, in which it said Lapid told Netanyahu by phone that he expected the Prime Minister ""to act responsibly and to stop dragging the (Israeli military) and our soldiers into an election for your political needs."" Yesh Atid claimed that ""unnecessary elections ... will harm the economy and Israeli society, all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra-orthodox parties, the powerful central committee of the Likud and outside lobby groups."" ""Prime Minister Netanyahu has failed in his management of the country and in dealing with the needs of the Israeli public,"" the Yesh Atid party said. ""The firing of ministers is an act of cowardice and loss of control.""","Netanyahu lays out his gripes with ministers: ""It's impossible to govern like this""

"Drum roll ... George Alexander Louis! The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced Wednesday that they've named their new bundle of joy. The tot ""will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge,"" according to Clarence House, the official residence of heirs to the throne. iReport: Do you have a traditional family name? Earlier Wednesday, word came that the couple are doing what new parents do: They are enjoying some incredibly sweet moments alone with their baby. The official statement said William and Catherine are now down to the business of getting ""to know their son."" The parents and the perhaps future king left Kensington Palace in London by car around lunchtime, UK media reported. The couple has been mum about their immediate schedules. British media were feverishly reporting where they might be, with the consensus being that the couple and child went to the village of Bucklebury, where Catherine's parents live. Earlier Wednesday, Queen Elizabeth II went to Kensington Palace to see the newborn for the first time. Uncle Harry paid a visit, too, the palace told reporters. The public got its first look at the child Tuesday evening, outside the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London. The prince and his wife said then that they had been ""working on a name."" ""So we'll have that as soon as we can...,"" William said. ""It's the first time we've seen him really, so we're having a proper chance to catch up."" Many bets were placed as the public waited for the announcement. British bookmakers Ladbrokes had George and James as favorites Wednesday, followed by Alexander, Arthur, Louis and Henry. Queen Ella? King Terry? What's in a royal name? William's name was announced a few days after birth; his brother Harry's upon leaving the hospital. Interactive: World reacts to royal baby news . The baby has a ""good pair of lungs,"" the prince told well-wishers Tuesday evening. ""He's got her looks, thankfully."" They took turns holding little George, wrapped in a cream-colored blanket. The parents waved. William said he'd already changed his first diaper. ""It's very emotional. It's such a special time,"" Catherine said. Third in line . The 8-pound, 6-ounce boy was born Monday afternoon. He's third in line, behind Charles and William, to the British throne. As well as ruling the United Kingdom, George Alexander Louis could one day be king of 15 other commonwealth countries that have the British monarch as head of state if none change their constitution in the meantime. They include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Belize and Jamaica. On their way out of the hospital, the couple walked down the same steps where Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Charles gave the world its first look at Prince William 31 years ago. Confused about the royals? Follow this handy family tree . William placed the teeny royal heir in a car seat in the back of a black sport utility vehicle, then got behind the wheel for the trip to their residence at Kensington Palace. The grand apartment they will eventually move into within the palace, Apartment 1A, is still being refurbished, so William and Catherine have been living in a small cottage in the grounds. Interactive: World reacts to royal baby news . The internal renovation work at Kensington Palace is due to be completed in the fall. The duke and duchess' staff will also move into refurbished offices there, according to Buckingham Palace accounts released last month. The late Diana moved into Kensington Palace after marrying Prince Charles in 1981. William and Harry were raised there. When she died in 1997, mourners laid flowers and tributes outside the palace gates. 'Absolutely beautiful' On Tuesday, London reverberated with the sound of cannon fire and peals of bells to mark the birth. Shortly before the new baby's departure from St. Mary's, Prince Charles stopped by for a brief visit with his first grandchild, accompanied by his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. He told reporters it was ""marvelous."" And Catherine's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, visited earlier. As grandmothers tend to do, she described her grandbaby as ""absolutely beautiful."" She and her husband were ""so thrilled"" about being grandparents. ""It was so exciting. It was fantastic,"" said Eliza Wells, one of the well-wishers gathered outside the hospital. ""The crowd erupted, because everyone's been waiting so long for it."" William and Catherine ""both seemed very relaxed, even with the press there and the crowd,"" Wells said. ""They just seemed like a normal couple."" A normal life? Royal commentators said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will try to give their son as regular an upbringing as possible.

"(CNN) -- ""Seinfeld"" had nothing to say -- and that was its genius. Other groundbreaking series make a point of stressing their inventiveness, practically shouting, ""Look at me!"" ""Seinfeld,"" on the other hand, blissfully took a Festivus pole to sitcom conventions, with unsympathetic characters, defiantly provincial New York interests and intricate plotting mechanisms -- and never called attention to itself. Not that there's anything wrong with that. In fact, there was so much right about the show that it eventually became TV's No. 1 program and one of the most lauded sitcoms ever. In the 25 years since ""Seinfeld"" premiered on July 5, 1989, as ""The Seinfeld Chronicles,"" it has worked its way into pop culture -- its catchphrases still repeated, its plots still recounted, its shocking revelations about writer John Cheever and pitcher Roger McDowell still gasped about. But enough yada yada yada. Here are five things that made nothing into everything: . 1. No hugging, no learning. In general, pre-""Seinfeld"" sitcoms included heartwarming laughs, sympathetic ""aws"" and lessons learned. But there were no social niceties for Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer. The quartet was so narcissistic that, when George's fiancÃ©e, Susan, died after licking defective wedding invitation envelopes in the seventh season, George and the gang shrugged and continued with their lives. Few sitcoms have dared to follow in its coldhearted footsteps, but there are exceptions, such as ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" ""Community"" and ""Seinfeld"" co-creator Larry David's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" (New York magazine's Matt Zoller Seitz makes the point that ""Seinfeld"" also paved the way for our recent bounty of coldhearted dramas.) The new, new TV golden age . 2. Four in one. Pre-""Seinfeld,"" most sitcoms were classic cases of simplicity: one major plot, perhaps one minor plot, play them out in 22 minutes and turn on the applause sign. ""Seinfeld"" sometimes had four plots -- one for each primary character -- and would put them together so Jerry's girlfriend with the real breasts (Teri Hatcher) would cross paths with Elaine in a steam room. Or aspiring hand model George would burn himself with the iron being used to smooth out Jerry's puffy shirt. In those days, not many serialized dramas would dare attempt such plot juggling, never mind comedies. It's still more the exception than the rule. 3. New York, New York. ""Seinfeld"" made the Big Apple the center of the sitcom universe. Suddenly it seemed like half of NBC's schedule was making ends meet in Manhattan -- ""Friends,"" ""Caroline in the City,"" ""Mad About You,"" ""The Single Guy,"" ""Will & Grace"" -- while ABC and CBS added to the mix with such shows as ""The King of Queens,"" ""Spin City"" and ""The Nanny."" New York was so prominent on '90s TV schedules that one ABC show, ""It's Like, You Know"" (created by ""Seinfeld"" writer and producer Peter Mehlman), made hay out of the concept of a New Yorker transplanted to Los Angeles. (Incidentally, for all its New Yorkiness, ""Seinfeld"" was shot at a studio in L.A.) 4. Heavy meta. Other sitcoms had been self-referential -- George Burns and Garry Shandling regularly broke the fourth wall in their programs -- but Jerry and his pals took meta-ness to a whole new level. Season four, in fact, was literally about a show within a show as Jerry and George pitched NBC ""a show about nothing"" called ""Jerry"" that bore eerie similarities to ""Seinfeld."" However, for all of ""Seinfeld's"" quotation marks, it often used real people and brand names. There really is a J. Peterman catalog, New York's American League baseball team really is the Yankees and those are real cereal brands on Jerry's shelf. However, Vandelay Industries is still fictional -- we think. 5. Sponge-worthy catchphrases. Few shows have produced as many popular quotations as ""Seinfeld."" You're probably reciting them now: ""No soup for you."" ""Master of your domain."" ""Yada yada."" ""Shrinkage."" ""Look to the cookie."" You can leave more of them in the comments ... unless you're a low-talker. In that case, you'll have to speak up. See more comedy content at CNN Comedy.

"The U.S. will keep a larger force in Afghanistan for the first few months of 2015 than it initially planned to, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Saturday. During a joint press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Hagel said that up to 10,800 troops will remain in the country at the start of next year; a previous announcement called for 1,000 fewer troops. Hagel arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday in order to assess the nation as the United States begins the drawdown of its forces in the New Year, he said. He said that President Barack Obama authorized the change in force size in order to provide military commanders ""flexibility."" ""The President's authorization will not change -- it will not change our troops' missions or the long-term timeline for our withdrawal,"" Hagel said. Kabul has seen an uptick in Taliban attacks in recent weeks, a sign of instability that he said comes as no surprise. ""It's predictable that they would do everything they could and continue to do to try to disrupt and discourage the new government of President Ghani,"" he said. However, the spike in violence in the Afghan capital was not a factor in the decision to keep more U.S. troops in the country next year, a Defense Department official said. The decision is due to the late signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement, which allows a specified amount of U.S. troops to remain in Afghanistan after the combat mission ends this year. Ghani's predecessor, Hamid Karzai, would not sign a security agreement with the United States. Despite the attacks, the Pentagon said Afghan forces are performing ""well,"" and are now in the lead on 99% of the missions. ""The gaps are in aviation and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance),"" a senior defense official told reporters on the flight to Afghanistan. This is his fourth and last visit to Afghanistan as defense secretary. His first trip to Afghanistan was 12 years ago as part of a Congressional delegation. Asked by CNN how he would define victory more than a decade later Hagel said the people of Afghanistan are far better off today than they were 13 years ago, citing an elected government and a national security force. ""They're not completely there yet, but they've come a long way,"" Hagel said. ""That's to the credit certainly of the United States, the sacrifice, the blood and the treasure that we've made there."" His visit comes after the establishment of a new unity government in the fall, which Hagel will express strong support for during his trip, a second senior defense official said. The drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan will be ""gradual"" compared with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the first official said. In 2016, the number of troops will slide down to 5,500 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to Kabul. ""As we draw down the combat mission, we have not forgotten what brought America to Afghanistan over a decade ago,"" Hagel said on Saturday. UK formally ends combat mission in Afghanistan . Maintaining a troop presence will allow the U.S. to monitor the progress of the Afghan security forces over time, according to the first official. ""The Afghan people and the Afghan government ...have asked us to stay,"" Hagel said contrasting the drawdown to the withdrawal troops in Iraq, where the U.S. could not negotiate an agreement that would allow a residual force in the country. The trip to Kabul follows Kabul's announcement last month that he will step down as soon as the Senate confirms his successor. Obama announced Friday that Ashton Carter will be his nominee to replace Hagel. Hagel, who has served as defense secretary since February last year, was forced out by Obama, several sources told CNN. During remarks announcing his resignation, Obama praised him as an ""exemplary"" defense secretary, calling him critical to various national security accomplishments during his tenure. He said Hagel's resignation was his own choice. A critic of the Iraq war, Hagel took over from his predecessor Robert Gates to oversee the draw down from Afghanistan and a heavily cut Pentagon budget. The former Nebraska senator was the last Republican in Obama's Cabinet. He is a Vietnam combat veteran. Hagel's unannounced visit will include stops in other countries in the region.","Up to 10,800 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan at the start of 2015 .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military launched its first airstrikes on Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's air defenses Saturday, a Pentagon official said. ""Earlier this afternoon, over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from both U.S. and British ships and submarines -- struck more than 20 integrated air defense systems and other air defense facilities ashore,"" U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney told reporters. He said the majority of the targets were on or near the coast, in the western part of the country. A senior military official said earlier that U.S. Tomahawk missiles landed in the area around Tripoli and Misrata, adding that the action was taken after Gadhafi failed to comply with a cease-fire. ""He's clearly been on the offensive,"" the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said of Gadhafi. ""He said that he was going to do a cease-fire and he continued to move his forces into Benghazi."" U.S. President Barack Obama confirmed that he had authorized ""limited military action in Libya"" and that ""that action has now begun."" He is planning for the U.S. portion of the military action in Libya to last just a few days, according to a senior administration official. ""In terms of the heavy kinetic portion of this military action, the president envisions it as lasting days, not weeks,"" said the senior official, who was not authorized to speak about sensitive military matters. ""After that we'll take more of a supporting role."" Obama noted that military action ""is not an outcome that the U.S. or any of our partners sought,"" pointing out that Gadhafi was offered the opportunity to comply with an immediate cease-fire. ""But despite the hollow words of his government, he has ignored that opportunity,"" Obama said. ""His attacks on his own people have continued, his forces have been on the move,"" and the danger for the Libyan people has grown. The airstrikes on Gadhafi's air defenses are the first phase in what will likely be a multiphase military operation. ""At this point we are creating the conditions to be able to set up the no-fly zone,"" Gortney said. The senior military official said earlier that phase two of the mission would include planes flying over Libyan airspace near Tripoli, and in the Mediterranean Sea near Benghazi. The coalition says the no-fly zone imposed as part of a U.N. Security Council resolution aims to prevent further attacks by regime forces on Libyan citizens and opposition groups, especially around Benghazi. In addition to the United States, four nations have publicly announced their participation: the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy and France. Other nations are expected to announce their participation soon. The initial mission will be commanded by U.S. Army Gen. Carter Ham and U.S. Africa Command. The Joint Task Force's ""Odyssey Dawn"" is being commanded by U.S. Navy Adm. Sam Locklear, on board the USS Mount Whitney in the Mediterranean Sea. ""The use of force is not our first choice, and is not a choice that I make lightly,"" Obama said in a statement from Brazil where he is on a tour of Latin America.

"More than 200,000 dolls from China, apparently shipped for holiday gift-giving, won't be going to any American children because U.S. authorities seized the shipments and alleged the toys contained banned chemical compounds, officials said Tuesday. The toys contained high levels of phthalates, which are chemical plasticizers used to make materials softer and more pliable, authorities said. Congress has banned the chemical in children's toys. The U.S. Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center began targeting the shipments in April because they threatened children's safety, authorities said. ""Using advanced technology to track certain shipments before they reach our shores is helping CPSC better protect America's consumers,"" Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Inez Tenenbaum said in a statement. U.S. authorities didn't identify the manufacturer of the toys Tuesday. A total of 10 shipments valued at almost $500,000 were seized at the ports of Chicago; Dallas; Los Angeles; Norfolk, Virginia; Memphis, Tennessee; Newark, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Savannah, Georgia, authorities said. Tenenbaum said her agency and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been targeting dangerous imports at several major ports through the use of a risk management system. Those efforts resulted in the seizure of more than 1.1 million unsafe products last fiscal year, authorities said. At the same time, the system also allows ""for faster processing of compliant products,"" she said. ""Expanding our port surveillance program is key to preventing injuries and achieving our long-term vision,"" Tenenbaum said. The U.S. toy industry lauded the seizure of the dangerous Chinese-made merchandise. ""The Toy Industry Association commends CBP and CPSC for their diligence and hard work at the ports to ensure that products violating strict federal safety laws never reach consumers,"" Ed Desmond, the group's executive vice president of external affairs, said in a statement.","More than 200,000 dolls from China allegedly contain banned chemicals .

"Supreme Court bloggers usually don't have fan clubs. But 81-year-old, twice-retired blogger Lyle Denniston became an Internet celebrity of sorts on Thursday amid the confusion about the Supreme Court's ruling on President Obama's health care law. Moments after the ruling was handed down, both CNN and Fox News briefly and incorrectly reported the Supreme Court had struck down a central provision of Obama's health care law. CNN corrected the error. Denniston's online publication, SCOTUSBlog, which stands for Supreme Court of the United States, however, got the news right, and published to Twitter only a minute after CNN did. ""#SCOTUS upholds #ACA individual mandate,"" said the blog's Twitter feed. More than 2,900 people retweeted that post. ""I think it took us maybe three minutes to figure out exactly what the court had done,"" which was to uphold a mandate on buying insurance, Denniston said by phone on Thursday afternoon. During that interview, fans approached Denniston asking him to take pictures with them while wearing T-shirts that say things like ""#TeamLyle"" -- an Internet meme started by fans of his fast-paced reporting. He doesn't expect the attention to last. ""In the digital and Internet age, I know that celebrity is likely to be prolonged for less than the usual 15 minutes,"" he said. ""Once today and maybe tomorrow is over, I think the phone at my house and my cell phone are going to stop ringing from people who want to talk to me. Celebrity, if that's what it is, is really fleeting ... "" Denniston and the SCOTUSBlog, which was founded by a husband-wife pair of attorneys in 2002, haven't exactly become household names, at least until this week. Their rise to prominence comes at a time when the Internet's instant news cycles are colliding with complicated stories like Supreme Court rulings. Plenty of news organizations leaned, in part, on SCOTUSBlog's fast, furious coverage of Thursday's ruling as a way to supplement their own live blogging of the event. Twitter become so flooded with chatter about the SCOTUSBlog that Slate's Farhad Manjoo wrote, ""Twitter is basically a mirror of Scotusblog now."" White House spokesman Jay Carney reportedly said in a news conference Wednesday that he would rely on TV news and the SCOTUSBlog to see what the court had decided in the landmark health care case. Editors at the blog anticipated the attention. ""Here we go. 4 more web servers. 5 bloggers. 2 tech teams. $25k for 20 mins,"" the group wrote on its Twitter feed, @SCOTUSBlog, which had more than 42,000 followers as of about 1 p.m. ET on Thursday. ""Probably more traffic today than in SB's first 5 years, combined. So grateful; a little scared,"" the group said on Twitter before the decision was handed down. The site has become known for its ""plain English"" versions of court news and for its expertise. Denniston, the veteran blogger, isn't an attorney but he joked in a 2007 interview with C-SPAN that he has ""always indulged the arrogance of saying the only time I've ever been in a law school was to teach."" The blog's co-founders, Tom Goldstein and Amy Howe, are both lawyers. Goldstein teaches Supreme Court litigation at Stanford and Harvard and has argued 25 cases in front of the Supreme Court, according to his online bio. Howe has argued two cases in front of the court. Denniston started his day by posting to the network's live blog: . ""Good morning from a slightly zoo-like, but still surprisingly civil, press room at the Court."" Three minutes later, a reader asked if he thought there would be a ""clear majority"" opinion. ""I am still hugging the trunk of the tree -- solidly avoiding any predicton (sic),"" he wrote. ""No limbs for a traditional journalist."" Denniston, who has covered the Supreme Court for 52 years and has twice gone into retirement, doesn't relish the attention. In fact, it bothers him a bit. ""I'm afraid I will be accused of false modesty if I say what I really feel, which is that in all of my years of journalism, I had never wanted to be part of the story. I would hope that when I say that people will take me sincerely. I grew up in journalism believing that the story was the story -- and not the messenger,"" he said. ""And what this kind of celebrity, as you put it, does is to lift the reporter out from behind the screen of objectivity and make the reporter the story. And that's troubling to me."" That kind of comment probably only will make fans adore him more. ""We are grateful to you! Thank you for everything. #TeamLyle,"" one wrote on Twitter. ""Because it is important to say, right now: #TEAMLYLE!"" said another. For a blogger, Denniston has an unusual history with technology. ""I don't do the Twitter thing very much,"" he said. ""I used to do it a bit. I'm usually so verbose in my writing -- 140 characters isn't nearly enough for me to even clear my throat."" In 1998 or 1999, he paid a tutor to teach him how to use the Internet. He often calls in information -- even entire stories -- to the blog's editors by phone, as he did with Thursday's news. Asked what keeps him going at age 81, he gave a personal answer. ""My father retired and it was virtually the end of his life,"" he said. ""He really declined after that. A long time ago I made up my mind that I would find something active to do, even though I left newspapering and sort of thought I was retired. ... It is just so immensely fascinating to me and I do find that having a prolonged institutional memory about the court and about the law and particularly about the Constitution makes it even fun for me to do. And it allows me to be an even greater resource for my readers."" Just in case you're thinking the Internet has gotten way too serious -- court reporter as meme? -- don't fret. There's of course another website that chose to tell the story of the court's decision in cat photos.","Blogger Lyle Denniston gains a degree of Internet celebrity on Thursday .

"A yellow jumpsuit worn by martial arts legend Bruce Lee in one of his final fight scenes fetched HK$780,000 ($100,500) at auction on Thursday. The famous outfit was one of 14 items in a collection of the actor's personal belongings and props that went under the hammer in Hong Kong. The sale fetched a total of more than HK$2 million ($258,000) -- double the auction house's estimate. The costume, which features black stripes, was sold to an anonymous online bidder who purchased a total of six pieces. It's one of only two jumpsuits worn by Lee during filming of the movie, ""Game of Death,"" and has inspired tributes in popular culture ranging from Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" to the ninth video game in the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series. Wooden nunchaku (also known as nunchuks) used in the central fighting sequence in ""Game of Death"" went to a British investment manager, George Philips, for HK$540,000 ($69,000). A green bamboo whip from the same film sold for HK$96,000 ($12,000). The auction marked the first time these pieces have been offered in Hong Kong, according to Anna Lee, vice-chairperson of Spink auction house, which sold the items on behalf of an unnamed collector in the U.S. film industry. All the lots came with a certificate of authenticity signed by members of Bruce Lee's family and friends, who inherited the items in 1973 after Lee's sudden death at the age of 32. Lee gave most pieces to his former student, Taky Kimura, and to George Lee -- a close friend who made many of the actor's fighting props. A jade pendant, which sold for HK$156,000 ($20,000), came from his brother, Robert. Bruce Lee designed and ordered the piece from one of Hong Kong's oldest jewelers just months before his death. ""He didn't get to see it because he passed away,"" Spink's Lee said. After the kung fu star's death, his brother went to the jeweler, Chow Sang Sang, and paid for the piece, which features two opposing dragons in white and yellow gold, taking it into his possession. While Lee is known as one of the world's greatest martial arts practitioners, he had many artistic talents including drawing, poetry and cha cha dancing. Two hand-drawn pieces were also part of the Hong Kong sale, including a sketch of Chinese master monk believed to be a conceptual character for ""The Green Bamboo Warrior,"" a movie project Lee was working on at the time of his death. The lot went for HK$66,000 ($8,500). The other was an illustration of his teachings on water's flexible nature as an underlying principle of his martial arts philosophy, jeet kune do, which fetched HK$78,000 ($10,000). Signed copies of a karate training book and a commemorative brochure, as well as a pair of Lee's kung fu shoes were among the other sale items. ""Bruce Lee is such an icon in Hong Kong. He personally kind of started this kung fu frenzy in the world way before Jackie Chan,"" said  Lee at Spink. ""Although he was born in the United States, his roots were definitely in Hong Kong."" ""He loved to write poems, he loved to draw; he was so cultural apart from being a kung fu star. He is definitely a legend,"" she said. Bruce Lee was born in San Francisco in 1940 but spent most of his childhood in Hong Kong after his parents returned to their hometown while Lee was an infant. He died after suffering an allergic reaction to pain medication in July 1973, while filming of ""Game of Death"" was still in progress. A version of the film was released five years later. The Spink auction was one of a series of events being held this year to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the star's death.","A rare collection of Bruce Lee's belongings sold for over $250,000 at auction .

"The British couple arrested after pulling their cancer-stricken son out of a hospital will not be charged, the Crown Prosecution Service told CNN on Tuesday. Brett and Naghmeh King were arrested over the weekend in Spain while authorities decided whether they would be charged and extradited back to Britain. On Monday, they said they would not return to the UK voluntarily, according to a Madrid court at which they appeared. The Kings say they had serious concerns about the medical treatment Ashya, 5, was receiving at University Hospital Southampton. So they defied doctors' orders and took him out. Hotel staff members in Malaga, Spain, recognized Ashya and his family from media coverage and contacted police. Ashya was taken to Materno Infantil Hospital in Spain, and that facility was communicating with University Hospital Southampton. The parents were taken into police custody. Brett King defended his actions in a YouTube video made shortly before his arrest. He accuses two doctors at the British hospital of not allowing him to seek proton beam treatment outside of Britain, even though he said he was ready to pay for the treatment himself. ""We pleaded with them for proton beam treatment. They looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer, which is called medulloblastoma, it would have no benefit whatsoever."" King said he then looked on the Internet and found sites in the United States, France and Switzerland on proton beam treatment that ""said the opposite -- that it would be beneficial for him."" The Kings traveled to Malaga with their six children to sell a home they own there, in order to ""look for better treatment"" for Ashya, said their Spanish lawyer, Juan Isidro Fernandez. The hospital in Southampton issued a statement saying doctors had discussed proton beam radiotherapy with Ashya's parents. ""We very much regret that the communication and relationship with the King family had broken down in this way and that for whatever reason they have lost confidence in us,"" said Dr. Michael Marsh, medical director at University Hospital Southampton. ""Our first concern is for Ashya's welfare"" Marsh said some tumors respond well to proton beam treatment, but ""there are some cases where there isn't the evidence that this is a beneficial treatment."" The hospital statement did not give specifics about Ashya's case. The 5-year-old's ordeal has captured the attention of British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""I welcome the prosecution against Ashya King's parents being dropped,"" he said Tuesday on Twitter. ""It's important this little boy gets treatment and the love of his family."" In the United States, only a handful of hospitals offer proton-beam therapy after surgery, including Massachusetts General Hospital, where the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy was treated for brain cancer in 2008. He died just a year after his surgery for malignant glioma. That surgery was followed by six weeks of radiation. Kennedy wrote about his experience in a Newsweek magazine article at the time that he underwent proton-beam therapy. The theory behind proton therapy is that its high-energy particles home in on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the X-ray photons in conventional therapy, said Dr. Donald O'Rourke, associate professor of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.","Parents who took son with brain cancer out of a British hospital will not be charged .

"Washington (CNN) --  U.S. military personnel are officially allowed to tweet. That's the upshot of the Pentagon's long-awaited policy on rank and file personnel using online social media, unveiled Friday. The new rules authorize access to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media Web sites from nonclassified government computers -- as long as such activity doesn't compromise operational security or involve prohibited activities or Web sites. Until now, the military's various branches and departments had differing policies regarding social media use. The Marine Corps, for instance, prohibited use of social media sites from its computers in 2007, according to the Pentagon. The Pentagon announced the policy Friday via social media such as Facebook and Twitter, in addition to using the Department of Defense's Web site, said spokesman Bryan Whitman. ""This directive recognizes the importance of balancing appropriate security measures while maximizing the capabilities afforded by 21st century Internet tools,"" said Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Lynn III, who signed the policy. The new policy denies military personnel access to sites promoting gambling, pornography or hate crimes from government computers. ""The world of Web 2.0 and the Internet provides these amazing opportunities to collaborate,"" said David M. Wennergren, deputy assistant secretary of defense for information management and technology. ""It not only promotes information sharing across organizational boundaries and with mission partners, but also enables deployed troops to maintain contact with their loved ones at home."" The new policy allows commanders to temporarily restrict online access to maintain operations security or to address bandwidth constraints.","Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, other social media Web sites OK on nonclassified computers .

"(CNN)An era of fumbling for spare change and driving in circles in search for a parking space may be coming to a close. Drivers across the nation and around the world are turning to mobile apps, websites and other forms of technology to both find and pay for parking with greater efficiency. At the same time, major U.S. cities and a new wave of startups are working to simplify the parking process, perhaps marking a revolution in the parking industry, experts say. Eric Meyer, 24, lives in the Baltimore neighborhood of Canton and knows firsthand about the frustrations of parking in a busy city. A former employee at Phillips Seafood, Meyer found himself driving in circles every time he headed home from work. ""Anyone who has lived in Canton or Federal Hill or a lot of these densely populated neighborhoods knows that searching for spots can be like looking for a needle in a haystack,"" Meyer said. So Meyer quit his job and founded the app Haystack, which allows a user who has a parking spot in the Baltimore area to offer it up for a price, usually around $3. A driver who needs a space pays and then takes the spot to complete the exchange. Cities across the U.S. are turning to similar innovative parking technologies. Just this month, Boston's Transportation Department announced plans to develop an app, expected to launch in the fall, letting residents pay for parking straight from their smartphones. The city of Evanston, Illinois, recently initiated a similar pilot program. Miami Beach partnered with ParkMobile and ParkMe in May to launch apps that help drivers find and pay for parking spots. And Chicago will be expanding its pay-by-phone parking service, ParkChicago, to all its 36,000 parking meters by the end of the summer after piloting the app since April. ""What we're seeing is a demand from our consumers to offer a level of convenience that really heretofore hadn't been the hallmark of the parking industry,"" said Casey Jones, spokesman for the International Parking Institute, the largest trade association for parking professionals and the parking industry. The U.S. and beyond . So why, beyond the growth of mobile payments in general, are these mobile parking apps catching on? Christina Martinez, marketing director of the app, website and in-car service Parkopedia, attributes the trend to the recent growth of U.S. urban populations. ""People are moving back into cities,"" Martinez said, ""and they need parking spots."" According to the International Parking Institute's 2013 report, the U.S. cities leading the way in parking innovation include San Francisco, New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. And although some apps are only available in select U.S. cities, others have expanded their usage nationally and even internationally. ParkMe provides data, availability and payment information for on- and off-street parking in more than 1,800 cities and 32 countries, according to its website. And ParkMobile, which was developed in 1999 in Europe, has since spread to the United States -- where it boasts 2.5 million members -- along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand, said Laurens Eckelboom, ParkMobile's executive vice president of business development. In general, compared to Europe, the United States has been a bit slower to adopt the concept of newer parking technologies, Eckelboom said. Parking has historically been more of a challenge in Europe where cities are generally more densely populated, but the U.S. is catching up quickly, he said. Legal threats . This new era of parking enables drivers to save time on the road and reduce the nation's carbon footprint, experts say. It's also transforming the parking industry, Jones said, illustrating a shift from cash-based to mainly electronic payment methods. But not everyone is thrilled with the emergence of these apps -- most notably, cities that make money from parking meters and, yes, parking fines. San Francisco, for example is experimenting with a pilot project that lets residents feed parking meters through credit, debit and public-transit cards. Sensors enable people to search for open spaces through a mobile app. San Francisco's city attorney has threatened to sue MonkeyParking, a startup whose app lets users pass along their parking space for a fee, if they don't shut down by July 11. Two other parking startups, Sweetch and ParkModo, will also face similar cease-and-desist demands this week, according to the city attorney's office. The attorney, Dennis Herrera, also sent a copy of his cease-and-desist letter to Apple, which makes the app available in its App Store. He argues the apps amount to illegally selling a public commodity. Supporters say the apps let users share information about parking spaces, not the spaces themselves. Besides, anyone can already text or call a friend and tell them a space is about to open up, they say. Convenience and conservation . Bryce Robertson, 20, of Highland Park, Illinois, uses the PassportParking app when he parks at the train station. This way he doesn't need to carry spare change, is notified when time on his parking space is running low and can then refill it remotely. ""My drives to the train station sometimes can cut it really close to where if I had to manually pay for parking, I would have missed my train,"" Robertson said. ""As long as I check my space number when I'm running from my car to the train, I can pay for parking while on the train."" Parking apps like ParkMe and SpotHero also let drivers compare prices of different parking spaces -- and prevent them from building up parking ticket fees. That's what inspired Jeremy Smith to launch SpotHero, a website and app that allows drivers to reserve parking and get discounts in garages in select cities. ""I had racked up about $5,000 in parking tickets,"" said Smith, co-founder and COO of the company. ""I realized if I was reserving my parking online, I could be solving my own problems."" The other plus side is the environmental impact, experts say. The less drivers idle, cruise and search for parking, the less the negative impact on the environment, said Kevin Blomberg, ParkMe's director of communications. The future of parking . The next step in this emerging trend may be in-car services that allow drivers to find and pay for parking spaces. ""When you're in your car, that presents a problem because you have to stop, pull over and start typing, or you're driving and texting, and it's not legal and it's dangerous,"" said Martinez of Parkopedia. ""When you're driving around, you don't want to be late, and you don't want to have to pull out different apps when you won't know which one does what."" That's why companies like Parkopedia and ParkMobile have partnered with automakers like Ford and Volvo to allow drivers to access parking services, some of which are voice-activated, from inside their vehicles. Six more similar partnerships are in the works for ParkMobile, according to Eckelboom. Eckelboom isn't completely sure what is yet to come in terms of parking technology, but he has pondered one possibility: . ""Connected vehicles are a valuable extension,"" Eckelboom said, ""but in the end you could also think about wearables (such as Google Glass). Maybe that will be another ... (way) to let you start a parking session.""","A new wave of startups are working to simplify the parking process .
Apps let drivers find and rent coveted parking spaces in crowded cities .
Motorists can book spots in advance and pay from their phones, saving time .
Cities across the U.S. are turning to similar innovative parking technologies ."
"The world's car giants go head-to-head as the Frankfurt Motor Show opens to the public. Flaunting the latest releases, the show is a tapestry of hybrid and concept designs from some of the most illustrious marques. But while the German city plays host to glitz and glamor, manufacturers are eyeing a burgeoning class of car buyers more than 6,000 miles away in China, where 200 million cars now run on the country's ever-congested roads. The world's largest car market, China is the major battleground for European companies in the 21st century, as premium brands look to exploit a growing population of 1.3 billion people. With European sales in decline and the U.S. market only slowly recovering, China represents a beacon of steady growth at a time of economic uncertainty. Read more: China on verge of worst economic crisis in decades . High domestic demand and rising wages are fueling a boom in the world's second biggest economy, with car sales increasing 11% in August year on year, according to the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. World Bank statistics show that China's GDP per capita -- an indicator used to measure the standard of living in a country -- had risen 436% between 2002 and 2012, from $1,135 to $6,091. Watch more: European production for Chinese cars . China's car market will almost match the combined size of the U.S. and western European market by 2019 with sales set to double from current levels, according to a report by consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers. And where once Chinese motorists were content to buy dated, home-grown vehicles -- or at best pale imitations of Western designs such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW -- now they want the real McCoy, according to analysts. Read more: China pushes for indigenous car brands . ""You see the same with the massive rise of the middle class in India,"" said Andrew Marsh, director of independent consultancy AutoIndustryInsider.com. ""Those who can afford it don't want the domestically produced tat. They want to have the Western names, vehicles built elsewhere."" U.S. auto giants Ford and General Motors have reported record sales increases in China for the month of August. The two Detroit-based companies reported a 46% and 11.2% rise respectively, with Ford citing strong demand for the Focus while GM-owned marque Buick sales for August are up 17.7% compared to the same month in 2012. Read more: Chinese automaker snaps up Volvo $1.8 billion deal . Car sales are also booming at the top end and this week McLaren Automotive said it would start trading in China for the first time. The British-based manufacturer of luxury, high-performance sports cars is opening four showrooms in major Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai in an effort to tap China's growing middle class. Mike Flewitt, chief executive officer of UK-based McLaren Automotive, said: ""We want to achieve a balanced global sales portfolio, with China contributing somewhere in the region of 10% of total sales."" Watch more: Will Chinese cars save Chrysler . McLaren's supercar range including the 12C, the 12C Spider and the P1 went on sale in China on September 9. The 12C and the Spider retail between £165,000 and £195,000 while the luxury P1 costs approximately £866,000. James Foxall, a motoring columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph, said that although western carmakers are clamoring to enter the Chinese market, foreign companies face a number of hurdles in the process. ""Western carmakers can't just pitch up and sell cars in China,"" he said. ""They have to go into a joint venture with a local manufacturer."" Watch more: Chinese car company sets up college . General Motors and Ford have both used local partnerships to enable them to produce cars in China. GM operates with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) while Ford is in a three-way venture with Chinese Changan and Japanese producer Mazda. The threat of counterfeiting is also brushed aside by the high-end Western car manufacturers. McLaren's Flewitt said the company was not ""overly worried"" by the prospect.  ""We are constantly investing a large amount of time, money and brainpower into R&D. That means that while a company may copy what we are producing today, by the time it is introduced and established by a competitor, we will already be focused on the next step forward."" And the reality is that copying a car badly may be simple; doing it to the quality of an Audi or BMW is incredibly difficult. As Foxall added: ""Then trying to mass produce it is even more difficult and the Chinese just haven't got that yet."" That's not to say that Chinese manufacturers are not trying to emulate less sophisticated European cars -- at least in terms of their design. Paolo Beconcini, a partner and intellectual property expert at Shanghai-based Carroll, Burdick and McDonough, argues that Chinese buyers are less ""demanding"" than western consumers who require the latest environmentally-friendly engines and safety features. ""Cars are first of all a status symbol, the gate to the middle class.Therefore, Chinese consumers focus more on the outer design of vehicles than in their technology, safety and performance.""","China car sales increasing 11% in August year on year, according to the state-backed manufacturers association .

"It's a fact that all-inclusive resorts can be expensive, with the average nightly rate at some of the bigger chains running $450 -- per person. And when you find one in your price range there's usually a caveat -- the beach is a 15-minute drive away, or the ""all"" only includes non-alcoholic beverages (those margaritas by the pool really add up). Budget Travel magazine's editors love a challenge and -- though it wasn't easy -- they found eight beachfront all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America starting at around $100 per person, per night. And they really are all-inclusive: a double room, three meals a day, drinks (from soda to cocktails), and lots of activities. And each one has an added bonus, too, from tennis lessons to scuba instructions. The only thing not included? Caveats. 22 can't miss U.S. beaches . Jolly Beach Resort & Spa, Antigua . Set on 40 acres (including a mile of white sand), the Jolly Beach Resort & Spa is great for those who want to get out on the turquoise water. Kayaks, windsurfers, and paddleboats are all at the ready and there are also two pools. Would you rather just take in the view of the waves? The 464 rooms all have at least partial ocean views. The resort also has five restaurants ranging from a casual beach take-out place to the Italian Bocciolo. Bonus: A proper afternoon tea with scones and cucumber sandwiches is also offered every day in the courtyard -- a nod to the island's British roots. Bolans Village, Antigua, 866/905-6559, jollybeachresort.com. From $221 per person, per night. ClubHotel Riu Negril, Jamaica . Head out to the far western tip of Jamaica and you'll find this lively beachfront resort in Negril. It is right on the beach, but the place to be is by one of the umbrella-shaded loungers around the two gigantic pools (both are well over 3,000 square feet). There is a party atmosphere here -- the complimentary mini bars and liquor dispensers in the 420 guest rooms are regularly restocked. If you want to go all out, head to the Pacha nightclub, where reggae is sure to be spinning. If you are looking for quiet, try the solarium terrace. Bonus: You'll score extra perks like complimentary entry and drinks at the posh Pacha nightclub and a free introductory scuba diving lesson in the resort pool.

Iberostar Costa Dorada, Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic Iberostar operates six hotels in the Dominican Republic, but this resort 10 minutes from Puerto Plata gives you the most for your money. The 516 rooms (which all have either a terrace or balcony) are located in thatch-roof buildings painted cheerful shades of yellow and purple. The entire property underwent a full renovation in 2011 resulting in completely remodeled rooms, a new lobby, and a renovated kids' club. There are three a la carte restaurants featuring Brazilian, Mexican, and international cuisine, plus a buffet restaurant. If you aren't content to just sit on the beach or the massive pool, there are activities all around the resort, from archery and tennis to kayaking and diving. Bonus: While some all-inclusive resorts only serve house-brand liquor, bartenders at Costa Dorada pour from imported names as well (Tanqueray, Stoli, etc.).

Royal Decameron Golf Beach Resort & Villas, Farallón, Panama . This 1,170-room mega resort 90 minutes from Panama City does things big from its spot on a mile of secluded beach. There are eight pools, 10 restaurants, and 11 bars (including one swim-up), which means you'll rarely do or see the same thing twice. Play in the Pacific with free paddleboards, kayaks, or windsurfers, or check out the local underwater residents with the provided snorkel gear. The nightlife is also big here and the party goes long after the sun sets (which probably has something to do with the open bar). Bonus: Though the base-rate is for a garden-view room, each one has a terrace or balcony overlooking the tropical foliage. Avenida Principal Farallón, Km 115, 011-507/993-2255, decameron.com. From $111 per person, per night. Sunscape Dorado Pacifico Ixtapa, Mexico . The Sunscape's budget-friendly price makes it a deal, but most people travel here for the location on a sandy beach on quiet Playa del Palmar. The resort re-opened in November of 2011 after a $10 million upgrade to all the rooms (including new furniture, flat-screen TVs, and fully renovated bathrooms) and restaurants as well as the addition of a new spa (alas, massages aren't covered in the all-inclusive rate and start at $68). There are only 285 rooms, but you'll find the choices typical of a much larger resort. There are four bars and eight restaurants ranging from seafood to Italian to Mexican (and the small size means no reservations are required). Bonus: Embrace your inner Serena Williams or Roger Federer and perfect your serve at the free tennis clinics. Paseo de Ixtapa S/N Lote 3-A, Ixtapa, 800/087-4890, sunscaperesorts.com.

The Krystal, located in the heart of the Hotel Zone on Punta Cancun, has 453 rooms, and each one has a view of either the Caribbean Sea or Cancun Lagoon. The rooms were renovated in December of 2011 and now feature luxury updates like marble floors, flat-screen TVs, and rain showers -- perfect for washing off all that sand. Bonus: One of the downsides of an all-inclusive resort is that you have to eat every meal on-site. Krystal includes a Discover Cancun pass that covers one dinner at a local restaurant. Paseo Kukulcan Km 9.5, Cancun, 800/437-9605, krystal-hotels.com. From $176 per person, per night. Barceló Langosta Beach, Tamarindo, Costa Rica . Staying here affords travelers the best of both worlds: The resort is on a secluded beach surrounded by rainforests and a national park, but is less than a mile from the popular town of Tamarindo. This is a low-key resort, with just one buffet restaurant and one a la carte restaurant serving Mediterranean cuisine (there is an additional $36-$42 fee for the a la carte restaurant) and one bar, plus a small casino and an amphitheater with daily entertainment. But the 134 rooms have views of the Pacific Ocean or the estuary of Las Baulas, part of the national park. Bonus: Tipping for the staff is included in the rate, so no need to reach for your wallet every time you order another round. El Robledal, Tamarindo, 800/227-2356, barcelo.com.

At just 246 rooms, this family-friendly resort is a fraction of the size of the 4,000-room Atlantis next door. But it's also a fraction of the price for the all-inclusive option. Paradise Island is on a private beach and has a large pool and three places to dine -- a pool-side grill, a buffet, and a steak and seafood a la carte restaurant. Unwinding is the first order of business here, so you won't find the same 24/7 whirl of activity here as at the mega resorts. But that doesn't mean anyone in your family will be bored. The kids' camp keeps them busy with sand castle building and craft making, and offers fun, active sports like pool volleyball and beach bowling.

"U.S. President Barack Obama didn't speak very long at the White House on Friday, but his message was clear: Russia should not use military force to change the fate of Ukraine. ""The United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine,"" Obama said. The president made his remarks as events moved quickly in Ukraine, with troops believed to be from Russia moving into Crimea, the southern section of Ukraine that favors close ties with neighboring Russia. Other parts of Ukraine and the new government leaders want to align with Europe. ""We are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine,"" Obama said. ""Russia has a historic relationship with Ukraine, including cultural and economic ties, and a military facility in Crimea, but any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe. ""It would represent a profound interference in matters that must be determined by the Ukrainian people."" He said Ukraine must be autonomous. ""Throughout this crisis, we have been very clear about one fundamental principle: The Ukrainian people deserve the opportunity to determine their own future,"" he said. Just before Obama spoke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, called for an ""urgent international"" mediation mission to Crimea. Also, a bipartisan group of 12 senators from the Foreign Relations Committee expressed support for U.S. assistance in Ukraine and warned of Russian intervention. ""We do not seek confrontation with President Putin and his government, but simply to ensure that Russia abides by its commitments and adheres to core principles of international law.  A peaceful, democratic, stable, and sovereign Ukraine is in our national interest,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Obama. Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Friday to ""reaffirm the United States' strong support for the new government and our commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democratic future of Ukraine,"" a statement from the vice president's office said.

"A nurse's assistant in Spain -- the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa -- has taken a turn for the worse. Dr. Yolanda Fuentes, who works at Madrid's Carlos III hospital, said Thursday that Teresa Romero Ramos' condition had worsened but declined to give further details. Romero became sick after she helped treat an Ebola-stricken Spanish missionary. Her case has prompted questions from her fellow medical professionals about whether they are properly equipped to safely treat Ebola patients, and about why a week passed before she was treated. The update on her condition comes 10 days after Romero first began feeling sick and three days after she called an ambulance to take her to a hospital. Carlos III hospital indicated late Thursday that seven more people -- a doctor, three nurses, two beauticians, a doctor and a hospital staffer -- have been admitted for observation. This is in addition to seven others already in the hospital, though none of these besides Romero has tested positive for Ebola. ""The reason why we are seeing so many people admitted showing no symptoms is because the 80 people or so that are being monitored outside the hospital have been given the choice to do it at home or come into the hospital,"" said a hospital spokeswoman, who is not named, as is customary in Spain. In addition to concerns about Romero and these individuals' health, the entire situation has raised serious questions about how the entire case was handled -- from how the nurse's assistant got the disease to how medical officials handled her care once she got sick. Physician: My protection suit was too short . One of the physicians sounding the alarm -- Dr. Juan Manuel Parra, who treated Romero at a different Madrid hospital earlier in the week -- published an open letter Thursday indicating that his staff was ill-equipped to handle her. Concerned about his exposure to Romero, Parra then checked himself into Carlos III. Parra was among five who the hospital said had no symptoms. Parra says he cared for Romero on Monday at Madrid's Alcorcon Hospital, where an ambulance had taken her that morning. He wrote that the sleeves on the protective suits available to him were too short, exposing parts of his arms. In his letter, published Thursday by Spanish news outlets, Parra wrote that Romero was in an isolation room. He said he visited her 12 times in isolation from 8 a.m. to midnight, when she was transferred to Carlos III, which specializes in infectious diseases. Her condition worsened throughout the day, and by the evening she had tested positive twice for Ebola, he wrote. But Parra said he learned of both positive results from media before hospital officials told him. Deadliest Ebola outbreak: What you need to know . He said he was told of the second positive test at 7 p.m., but it took five more hours for an ambulance to collect her for the trip to Carlos III, he wrote. Parra adds to a chorus of Spanish medical professionals who've expressed alarm. Speaking about what's unfolding in Madrid, Health Minister Ana Mato told Parliament earlier this week Spain is going to revise its protocols for handling Ebola. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said that his country is ""facing a matter that is of international concern."" But that doesn't mean Spaniards should hunker down or become overly alarmed, he said, and urged them to ""keep calm."" How NYC is preparing for Ebola . Dismay in Madrid . The Ebola virus has infected more than 8,000 people and killed at least 3,800 in the current outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. It's also been largely confined -- as far as we know so far, every person has caught the disease in West Africa except for Romero. Romero's case began after two Spanish missionaries -- Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo -- contracted Ebola in West Africa. They were sent to Spain, specifically Carlos III, for treatment. Romero twice had contact with one of the priests as part of his care, on September 24 and September 25, the WHO said. Both priests eventually died at the hospital. Romero's patient died on September 25; on September 29, she began feeling ill. That Romero may have gotten Ebola at Carlos III is a major cause of concern, especially if she did -- as she told Spanish newspaper El Mundo -- follow the necessary protocols while caring for the missionaries. How did Spanish nurse catch Ebola? Dr. German Ramirez, who is among those treating her, said Romero may have been exposed while removing protective gear she'd donned to treat one of the priests. ""That's what we were working on -- on the errors possibly made while removing the protective suit,"" Ramirez told reporters this week, saying it's possible the protective suit or gloves may have touched her face. On Tuesday -- the morning that Romero was transferred from Alcorcon to Carlos III for treatment -- angry doctors and nurses outside Carlos III said they were outraged that the two priests, almost dead when they arrived, had been brought there. Also prompting concern is how long it took for Romero to be treated -- and how long she may have exposed other people to the deadly virus while she was contagious. According to a Carlos III hospital spokeswoman, Romero started feeling ill on September 29. She went the next day to her doctor, who did not properly identify her problem and sent her home. But Romero didn't get better. She called Carlos III hospital on October 2 and was directed, per protocol, to an external medical department under the umbrella of Madrid's regional health service, the hospital spokesman said. Romero ended up back home again. On Monday, she called an ambulance, which took her to Alcorcon hospital, which diagnosed her over a 16-hour period and sent her to Carlos III. Parra's letter didn't address how long Romero might have been outside an isolation room at Alcorcon. A worker at that hospital told CNN on condition of anonymity earlier this week that Romero lay in the emergency room -- exposed to other patients as well as medical staff -- for eight hours before she was transferred to Carlos III. Romero's experience is similar to that of Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian citizen who was sent home from a Dallas, Texas, hospital days before eventually being admitted for Ebola. Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died Wednesday. Romero's dog put down . Authorities said Tuesday that a total of 30 people from Carlos III Hospital and 22 others -- from the Alcorcon hospital where the woman first sought care, plus family members -- were being monitored. Madrid health authorities on Wednesday put down Romero's dog, Excalibur, despite a public outcry to save it. 'Save Excalibur' campaign fails . About 400,000 people signed an online petition to save the dog from being killed, contending that that ""it would be much easier to isolate or quarantine the dog just as they have the victim's husband,"" rather than forcing the couple to lose ""one of the family."" But health authorities insisted they had to take action in case Excalibur had the disease. It's not known if Ebola can be passed through canines. The World Health Organization has said that it's infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines. Human infections, to date, have not been linked to dogs.

"Last time I was in Seattle I burned down an apartment. It wasn't arson; it was the faulty wiring on a trash-picked lamp. Or, from the look of the hard black puddle that used to be my stereo, a bad wall outlet. I never found out because two days later I left town to wait tables at Yellowstone National Park. As the Space Needle turned into a knitting needle in the rearview mirror of the bus I was riding, I wrote bad poetry and fractured thoughts into my soot-stained journal, including this: . ""Seattle is too nice. Better to live here when I'm older and have a family. I hope Jeff is able to get my deposit back."" That was 19 years ago. I still don't have a family. Seattle has only gotten nicer. And I'm happy to report that Jeff, my former apartment manager, was able to get my deposit back. Visiting Seattle again, recently, I felt traces of what I was getting at with the ""too nice"" thing.  Coming from most places in the United States, the city can feel a bit like visiting a friend's upper middle class parents' house while they are away for the weekend. It's wealthy, its yard is beautiful (verdant, bracketed by two mountain ranges), it has nice amenities and the fridge is stocked. I think my trash-picking bohemian 18-year-old self was looking for something more edgy and glamorous.* . Here's what  ""too nice""** can mean to a visitor. You wake up on Saturday morning and after securing breakfast at Pike Place Market -- where one can grab coffee, crumpets, full breakfasts with a view, the best scrambled eggs ever or whatever morning vittles you require -- you then have to decide what to do next. A visit to the Olympic Sculpture Park on the edge of downtown? A stroll through trendy Capitol Hill's boutique shops, cafes and restaurants?  A ride up the Space Needle or a climb up the brick water tower in Volunteer Park? Sail Lake Union? Or trek to one of the city's vital outer neighborhoods like Fremont, the self-proclaimed Center of the Universe, or Ballard, a Scandinavian fishing village turned hipster retail district? That's a lot. Too nice? Probably not. Too much? Possibly. Here's what I did:  All of the above. After breakfast I started at the Olympic Sculpture Garden,*** a zig-zag of 20 outdoor sculptures made by the art world all-stars (Calder, Serra, Bourgeois). It feels kind of like a highbrow miniature golf course.  There are mini-ecosystems created to reflect Washington's biodiversity. A mini-aspen grove, a sloping meadow of grass and wildflowers. There are bright red movable chairs where you can rest and a pedestrian bridge over functioning train tracks. And there's a water hazard: glorious Puget Sound itself. The garden spills onto beach littered with driftwood and an arsenal of skipping stones. You don't have to admire the water from the beach. There are scads of boat tours for visitors. But what you should really do is head to the Center for Wooden Boats on the south shore of Lake Union. Imagine a car museum that lets you rent the cars. That's how Center for Wooden Boats works. It's also a living workspace filled with volunteers building, repairing and maintaining boats. As you stroll the floating dock and talk with the people there you begin to learn another language. ""Luff "" is the forward-most vertical edge of a sail. A ""sloop"" is a single fore-and-aft rigged mast and bowsprit.  A ""fishing smack"" is a boat for fishing. I went on one of Center for Wooden Boats free Sunday sails (They leave at 1:00 and 2:30, but sign-up begins at 10 a.m., so get there early.) and met a couple from Oregon celebrating their 40th anniversary.  We blew by gaudy power yachts moored to the coast and imagined we were pirates. The sky overhead looked like a pile of oyster shells. There is probably a word for the feeling of being surrounded by water that's surrounded by a city. I don't know it.  All I know is that I was sad when we had to dock the boat. But I got over it. I went to visit the spot of my old apartment in Capitol Hill. Like many city hills, the top of Capitol Hill is wealthy and older and the neighborhood gets poorer and younger as you move down toward  Interstate 5 which separates it from Belltown. Of course, I used to live at the bottom. The year I left, a new coffee shop opened called Bauhaus. It's now an institution. And the area around it is now all a-bustle. A block away is Melrose Market, a hipster-foodie Valhalla complete with record store, wine bar and sustainable sandwich shop. It was also home to the best meal I had in a city filled with best meals. Sitka & Spruce embodies the gourmet, local in a casual setting that defines much of the city's food culture. As you climb the hill on Pine Street you begin to see restaurant after shop after bar. The area rivals any other urban trend center in the United States. If you can make it through the gantlet of cocktails and kombucha, you'll be rewarded by the many treasures of verdant Volunteer Park. Yes, the Space Needle downtown is worth a ride, but the old brick water tower in Volunteer Park gives you something the Space Needle can't: a view of the Space Needle. The park also boasts the Seattle Asian Art Museum and a conservatory teeming with flowers. But my favorite spot is Bruce Lee's grave, just north of the park in Lake View Cemetery. You can find it by looking for the goth kids milling about Bruce's son Brandon's grave. He's buried next to his father.  The grave site reminds you of all the cultural figures that at one point called the Emerald City home: Jimi Hendrix, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and, yeah, Kurt Cobain. On my last day, I boarded a bus (there is a nifty free smartphone app for Seattle called OneBusAway that pinpoints your location and tells you where the closest bus is and where it will take you) and went to Ballard, a little Scandinavian fishing village that reluctantly became part of Seattle in 1907. It's brick. It has an all-day market on Sundays. There are more cute boutiques and restaurants than you can shake an umbrella at. But the best part is the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, where you can watch as boats are safely transitioned to the different water levels as they move from salt water to fresh water. Below the lock is a fish ladder where you can watch the area's famous salmon swim upstream on biological autopilot to mate and hatch their eggs. Watch them through huge glass windows as they make. their. way. back. home. to procreate. In Seattle. It might be too nice for a restless East Coast 18-year-old under the influence of Kerouac, but even the salmon know it's a good place to return and raise a family. Footnotes . * Of course Seattle did have an edge to it in the early '90s. Heroin addiction was rampant (the curse of being a Pacific Rim port town at the time). The closest I came to the city's drug trade was when I accompanied my co-worker from DeLaurenti, an Italian specialty food store in Pike Place Market, while he bought marijuana from his old friend who ""hadn't not had weed since the late '70s.""  (There was apparently a ""weed drought"" that summer.) I was unaware of who we were visiting until I innocently asked our host about the huge new guitar amplifier in his living room. ""Oh that? They sent it to me for free when they found out we were opening for Pearl Jam,"" he said while staring at the 6 o'clock news on TV.  ""I was like 'Whatever I'm not going to be opening for Pearl Jam my whole life.' "" ""What's the name of your band?"" I asked. ""Mudhoney."" ** Now let's not get carried away, Seattle is a modern city with all the attendant problems that entails. There is poverty (some say the phrase ""skid row"" was invented here) and in particular a high concentration of ""gutter punks."" That is, kids with hoodies, tattoos, dogs and suspiciously good orthodontia who ask for money with a sneer. But even the poverty situation here feels less hopeless than other places. Roger, a homeless guy I split a hot dog with my first night there, told me, ""They take care of their homeless people here."" *** Let the fact that this city recently unveiled an $85 million outdoor sculpture garden tell you everything you need to know about the weather. Yes, it rains. But, as every Seattle booster will quickly tell you, not as much per year as New York or even Miami, and the weather is always temperate. Ah, yes, but what about the number of grey days? Well, it's not a coincidence that Seattle invented America's modern coffee addiction and its biggest online (i.e. don't have to go outside) retailer. But, truly, would you visit Cancun when the sun wasn't out? Or New York when it's empty? The weather is part of Seattle's identity, and I encourage people to visit during the long grey season. Bonus: There are travel deals to be had.","A long-ago Seattle resident returns to the city he deemed ""too nice"" at 18 .

"For weeks now, I've been warning viewers about the video I'm about to show them. They are horrific images from the conflict in Syria -- images of blood-stained walls, butchered children and dead babies. On air, I preface the footage with an emphatic warning: ""They are disturbing and not appropriate for all viewers. But given the nature of the attack and the number of dead, we believe showing them is necessary to convey the extent of this atrocity."" Opposition groups say almost 13,000 people have died since the uprising began more than a year ago, with countless more wounded. Photojournalist Robert King risked his life to document the human toll in the besieged Syrian city of Al Qusayr. His footage takes you inside the makeshift hospitals where doctors and medics work under appalling conditions. You see the blood-soaked mattresses. You see the bloodied children. You hear their wailing mothers. Syria rebels turn to homemade bombs . King tells me in the 20 years he's been covering conflict, he has never photographed so many wounded children. He wants his footage to tell the story of the Syrian people to the wider public.  ""I also hope these images can be a historical reference to prosecute Assad for war crimes against humanity,"" he said. The unaltered image is the ultimate portrayal of reality. It depicts the terror on the ground and the urgent need for help. But can it stop the bloodshed? U.N. monitors find Syrian ghost town . This month is the 40th anniversary of one of the most unforgettable images of modern conflict.  It's the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of nine-year-old Kim Phuc taken during the Vietnam War on June 8, 1972. She is naked and running, her clothes and layers of skin melted away by napalm. Huynh Cong ""Nick"" Ut took the photograph. He also helped the young girl get treatment for her injuries. She survived and later founded the Kim Phuc Foundation, providing medical and psychological help to child victims of war. The haunting image of the aftermath of a napalm attack captured the horror of this bloody conflict. It also, some believe, helped to end the war. Veteran photo editor Horst Faas, who died in May this year, once said: ""It changed the war. I met so many American soldiers who said 'Nicky because of your picture I'll get to go home early.'"" A single snapshot can depict the truth of conflict and drive commitment to end the violence. But that's not the case for Syria. Thanks to video clips uploaded by opposition activists to YouTube and the work of journalists like King, we have -- for months -- witnessed the constant death, pain and suffering inside Syria. And yet, there is diplomatic deadlock at the United Nations. A massacre is followed by reports of another mass killing. The conflict drags on and on and on. King has given Syria's victims a human face with his footage. But he's more horrified by the public apathy than the atrocities he's captured on video. ""I've never experienced such an indifference with the public,"" he told me with an exasperated sigh.  ""I was amazed. I've photographed children wounded in Sarajevo and moved nations into action. But here in Syria, you have wounded children everyday and nobody seems to care. It's horrifying."" The shots from Syria taken by him and others have been seen around the world. But these stirring images have failed to stir any meaningful action.","Photojournalist Robert King risks his life to document the human toll in Syria's conflict .

"(CNN) -- Thousands gathered outside Warsaw's presidential palace on Saturday evening to lay flowers and light candles in honor of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in western Russia earlier in the day. Kaczynski's wife and several top military officials were also killed in the crash. ""There is going to be a huge gap in public life in Poland,"" said resident Magdalena Hendrysiak. ""The most important people are dead."" Russian officials said that 97 people were killed when the plane carrying Kaczynski crashed as it was trying to land at an airport near the city of Smolensk. Parliament Speaker Bronislaw Komorowski took over as acting president and declared it ""a time for national mourning."" Kaczynski, 60, had been traveling with a Polish delegation to Russia for the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn. Some 20,000 Poles, including soldiers and civilians, were executed there during World War II. The event was to be a milestone in the easing of relations between Russia and Poland, strained for decades over Poland's close relationship to the United States and because of lingering ill will over Russia's campaign against the Poles in the 1940s. ""A shared tragedy of this sort could give a boost to further improvement in Polish-Russian relations, which ... were on the mend,"" said Tomas Valasek of the Center for European Reform. ""This tragedy might accelerate that trend."" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin appeared together in Smolensk on Saturday night. Russia has declared Monday a day of mourning, though Russian television portrayed Kaczynski in a largely negative light on Saturday, highlighting the Polish president's criticisms of Moscow. The Polish military plane carrying Kaczynski originated in Warsaw, the Polish Defense Ministry said. It was just a few miles east of Katyn when it crashed around 10:50 a.m. (2:50 a.m. ET) on the outskirts of the town of Pechorsk, close to Smolensk, the Investigation Committee of the Russian prosecutor's office said. Russian officials on Saturday emphasized that there is no evidence it was responsible for the crash. The Investigation Committee said the plane, a Tupolev-154, was trying to land in heavy fog. A Russian military official said that air traffic control in Smolensk had tried to divert the plane to another airport because of inclement weather. CNN's Richard Quest reports on the Tupolev-154 . ""The air traffic control officer gave several orders to divert but the plane continued with its descent,"" said Alexander Aleshin, a top Russian Air Force official. ""Unfortunately, this ended in tragedy."" Russian President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Putin to head an inquiry commission and sent Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu to the scene of the crash, the Kremlin said. ""We had a lot in common as presidents and as ordinary people and I can assure you that the death of Lech Kaczynski will be investigated and that we will uncover all the circumstances of this plane crash,"" Medvedev said Saturday. Other Polish officials killed in the crash include Aleksander Szczyglo, the head of the National Security Office; Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the deputy parliament speaker; Andrzej Kremer, the deputy foreign minister; and Gen. Franciszek Gagor, the army chief of staff, according to Kaczynski's Law and Justice Party. The party also said that Slawomir Skrzypek, head of the National Bank of Poland, was killed. ""The entire top military brass, including the chief of defense and all the services, were on the plane,"" Valasek said. ""You're looking at a situation, in effect, of the decapitation of the military services."" Putin spoke Saturday at the crash site, where charred pieces of the airplane were strewn through a wooded area. Some pieces, including one of the wheel wells, were upside down. ""As our first priority, we must establish the causes of this tragedy,"" he said. ""As a second priority, we must do everything in our power to assist the families and relatives of the deceased."" The plane carrying Kaczynski was refurbished and repaired last year, according to Alexei Gusev, general director of Aviakor Factory, the company that performed the service. ""Speaking openly, we believe that this tragedy could not have been caused by equipment failure,"" he said. Kaczynski had been president since December 2005, after he defeated rival Tusk in the second round of voting. The two men did not have a good relationship. In parliamentary elections in 2007, Tusk's Civic Platform beat the Law and Justice Party of Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who was prime minister at the time. Tusk put political differences aside as he spoke to the nation Saturday. ""I wanted, in the name of all the Polish people, to pass words of condolences to the familiy of the Polish president, to his daughter, to his mother, to his brother, and to all the families of all the victims,"" he said. Tusk and Polish Cabinet ministers held a special meeting Saturday morning to discuss the situation. Elections must now be held within 60 days, said Dariusz Rosati, Poland's former foreign minister. Valasek pointed out, however, that the Polish president is the head of state, not head of government -- meaning essential services will continue. ""The role of the Polish president is not quite ceremonial ... he has some very real powers, but at the end of the day, the day-to-day running of the government is in the hands of the prime minister and the (cabinet) ministers,"" Valasek said. ""Continuity is assured in ways that would not necessarily be assured in the case of the death of the U.S. president."" World leaders pay tribute to Kaczynski . Meanwhile Saturday, condolences poured in from around the world, including from British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. ""President Kaczynski was a distinguished statesman who played a key role in the Solidarity movement, and he was widely admired in the United States as a leader dedicated to advancing freedom and human dignity,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. CNN's Melissa Gray in London, England, and Max Tkachenko in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, contributed to this report.","NEW: Thousands in Warsaw mourn death of President Lech Kaczynski .

"How has life changed for new dad Marc Lesser? Well, for one, he hasn't slept more than two to three consecutive hours since his son, Sam, arrived a month ago. Lesser gets up with his wife for overnight feedings. ""I'm the baby passer,"" he told me during an interview when he could have been sleeping instead. When the baby wakes up, Lesser passes him from the crib to his wife, Pauline, then takes a cat-nap before burping and rocking the baby to sleep when feeding time is over. OK, moms, how many of you are jealous right now? ""I don't want to make myself sound better than I am because there are certain feedings that after I pass him off, I pass out,"" he joked. Fatherhood has clearly changed from when I grew up and dads were about as likely to wake during the night as they were to actually give birth. As even Prince William demonstrated in a recent interview with CNN, his first since the birth of his son George, modern dads are more and more involved and wouldn't have it any other way. CNN's Max Foster: Tired, elated Prince William could be any new dad . But there's a huge learning curve for first-time dads, which can make them feel clueless even as they jump up to help with the diaper changes and bottle feedings. I asked dads to share what surprised, delighted and woke them up in a cold sweat during their first days of parenting. The fears . In conversations with fathers across the country, a common fear -- during those earliest days -- emerged: How exactly do you handle a newborn? Mike Little, a father of identical twin boys in Birmingham, Michigan, said he had never changed a diaper before his kids were born. ""I just thought I don't know if I am going to be any good at this,"" he said in between yawns. (His kids are just 6 months old!) ""It comes to you pretty quick. I was changing diapers with no problem,"" he said. Lesser, worried his son might stop breathing, did something I actually still do (even though my kids are 5 and 7!): He checked the baby's chest to make sure he was still breathing. Prince William and dads everywhere show 'Mr. Mom' is outdated . Now that he's tackled that anxiety, and considers himself a ""master swaddler,"" he can focus on what he calls his ""future fears."" The founder of a video production company called Lucky Tiger Productions (we worked together previously during my time at iVillage.com), Lesser said the pressure of providing for a new family can be overwhelming and lead to lots of questions. ""Like will I remain gainfully employed and take care of this family?"" he said with a laugh. ""And then the other, I guess, is just I hope I don't pass on all my neuroses."" Some new fathers are a bit more freewheeling. Peter Shankman, a successful New York entrepreneur and proud father of 13-week-old Jessa, recently spent five days alone with his daughter while his wife was overseas for work. ""I was thrilled to tell her ... that the kid has all her fingers, all her toes,"" he said, describing his phone conversation with his wife. ""She's been in a new outfit every day."" Shankman said he wasn't worried at all about going solo, and bases his confidence on the logic that kids have been surviving for years without their parents' sterilizing bottles and everything else. ""You don't have to Purell your life away,"" he joked. Drop in sex drive isn't exclusive to mothers . Go-to gadgets for dads . To keep tabs on their little ones, some of the dads I talked with have come up with some, let's say, unusual approaches. Shankman reached out to friends in the security industry, and installed a device on his daughter's crib, which sends an alert to his phone when there is any motion above the height of the crib. ""There is something to be said for having a dad who is a complete geek,"" he joked. Lesser is resorting to some more traditional devices, calling the ""pee-pee teepee,"" which covers the boy's penis during diaper changes, his ""savior."" ""I've learned the hard way because definitely at 5 o'clock in the morning, there'd be a couple of times where I forget to put it on and the next thing I know I feel something warm on my shirt,"" he said. Modern fathers face new expectations . Work-life balance . While we often talk about the ""work-life balance"" issue as mainly a working mom phenomenon, the dads I spoke with made it clear it's very much a working father issue as well. Cody Mathers of Houston, Minnesota, whose little girl Willow is about to be 3 months old, said the biggest stressor of being a dad is ""finding that way to balance career and fatherhood."" Certain times of the year, he said, his job as an operations manager for a company providing online curriculums to schools requires a 70+ hour workweek. ""Traditionally, the father is the provider, but also now, you couple that with the additional societal expectation that they're more involved in the child-rearing, so what's going to give?"" he wondered. Photos: Bored dads at One Direction concert . Dads: Forgotten piece of the puzzle? Every father I spoke with said he did more of the child care -- and the housework -- than his dad and his grandfather did. ""My dad never changed my diaper, I don't think, and never really did much of the housework to help Mom out,"" said Mathers.  ""I'm doing those things ... and I don't think I'm unusual in that respect, either."" Lesser said that when older family friends come to visit, he thinks they're probably a bit surprised. ""Because I am the one changing the diapers and burping the baby and I know it's totally different for them,"" he said. ""It's evolution in a very good way."" With everything dads are doing now, I wondered if we give them enough credit -- we being society in general, moms, media, etc. No more dumb old dad: Changing the bumbling dad stereotype . Shankman said he gets frustrated at the portrayal of dads as clueless and uninvolved. He said he once received what he called a ""dad-proof onesie"" complete with instructions on the clothing for where the arms and feet go. ""Are you freakin' kidding me?"" he said. Little said people often focus on how the baby is doing and how the mom is, and said while that makes sense physically, the emotional effects of parenthood on dads might get overlooked. ""I had a friend of mine who told me when these babies are born, no one is going to ask you how you're doing, so I'm going to make sure that I do,"" he said as he fought another yawn. ""And he's right, because I do think that happens a bit."" How life has changed . In his interview with CNN, Prince William said a lot of things affect him differently now that he's a dad, and all the fathers I spoke with could completely relate. ""The babies have given me sort of a sense there is something bigger than work,"" said Little, who works long hours as an attorney in a big law firm. ""When I come home and I'm stressed and you see those two and you see the faces, you realize that it's just work, so I do think it changes everything."" It changes everything, indeed, including how little time you now have for each other, said Mathers. He and his wife used to enjoy a date night every Friday but that went away when Willow was born. ""That's an adjustment, but the reward is better,"" he said. Follow Kelly Wallace on Twitter and like CNN Living on Facebook.","Dads from across the country talk about their first days of parenting .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Chelsea Handler often aims to spark controversy, and one of her latest Instagram snapshots is no exception. It shows Handler posing topless astride a horse in the style of a famous photo of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Her message: ""Anything a man can do, a woman has the right to do better. #kremlin"" Instagram pulled the photo down more than once, according to Handler, because it violated the company's standards. Handler posted a notice from Instagram that says the photo doesn't follow the app's community guidelines, which specify, ""Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued."" Handler argues that the company's implementation of its policy is sexist. ""If a man posts a photo of his nipples, it's ok, but not a woman? Are we in 1825?"" Instagram has not responded to requests for comment. The topic of women having the right to go topless on social media was addressed by Scout Willis, daughter of actors Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, in May when she posted photos to Twitter of herself walking topless in New York. Willis chastised Instagram for its nudity policy in the tweets: ""Legal in NYC but not on @instagram"" and ""What @instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple."" Handler has apparently decided that Instagram is too restrictive for her purposes. She posted a photo of her adorable pups to the site Friday along with a farewell message.

"Berlin has long been a magnet for artists and art fans from around the world, so it's no shock it crams about 300 public and privately owned galleries into its city limits. Inevitably, the greatest symbol of the city's recent history, the Berlin Wall, has been a focus for some of this creativity, spawning the East Side Gallery, a 1.3-kilometer section now covered in paintings by international artists. It doesn't stop there. Scattered across the city are intriguing artworks related to the Berlin Wall -- many of which are often overlooked by both visitors and residents. Here are eight places worth checking out. Bornholmer Strasse S-Bahn Station . A bright red oval sculpture, which -- despite its slightly battered appearance -- seems to beckon passersby to take a seat, is located in front of Bornholmer Strasse S-Bahn station. During the time of the Berlin Wall, the Bornholmer Strasse checkpoint was one of seven border crossings within the city. It was also the first checkpoint along the Wall to be opened on November 9, 1989. Under the name ""(e.) Twin Gabriel,"" artists Else Gabriel and Ullf Wrede created the sculpture -- titled ""Mind the Gap"" -- as a way to point out to viewers that the former border crossing was ""an interface between two systems, a chilblain of the Cold War."" Getting there: Located at the exit of Bornholmer Strasse S-Bahn. iReport: Tell us what's your favorite thing about Berlin . Oberbaumbrucke at night . Located across the East Side Gallery, the Oberbaumbrucke Bridge connects Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, former boroughs that were separated by the wall. The bridge is worth seeing during the day, but it becomes more interesting at night. From dusk until one in the morning, visitors get a glimpse of ""Rock, Paper, Scissors,"" a piece by Thorsten Goldberg that features two round light boxes installed in the elevated railway bridge running above the Spree river. Inside the boxes, randomized neon signs depicting contours of gestures from the popular hand game are lit up and changed every six seconds. ""By using this game of chance, the division of the city and the significance of the bridge as a border crossing between East and West Berlin from 1972 to 1989 are put in an artistic context,"" writes Goldberg about his piece. Getting there: From Schlesisches Tor U-Bahn station, walk on Oberbaumstrasse toward the Spree river. Along the Berlin Wall on November 7-9, 2014 . On the weekend marking the 25th anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a one-time light installation is planned that promises to be stunning. ""Lichtgrenze"" (Border of Lights) will feature 8,000 illuminated white balloons running about 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) along the former path of the wall. Each balloon belongs to a ""balloon patron"" and represents a story about how the wall affected individual lives. In addition to various events and open-air exhibitions planned along the Lichtgrenze during the weekend, there will be a ceremony on the evening of November 9, in which the balloons will be released into the sky after a performance by the Staatskapelle Berlin orchestra. Getting there: The installation will stretch from Bornholmer Strasse and Bosebrucke to the East Side Gallery and Oberbaumbrucke. Chausseestrasse . In the Berlin borough of Wedding, 120 life-sized silhouettes of rabbits running, crouching and hopping are inlaid into the ground along Chausseestrasse, once occupied by a former border checkpoint. According to Karla Sachse -- the artist behind ""Kaninchenfeld"" (Rabbit Field) -- the animals are symbolic because they were able to dig under the wall during the Cold War and had the freedom to go where they wanted. The creatures were also regarded by people living on both sides of the wall as peaceful inhabitants. Although part of Sachse's work is currently hidden by construction in the area, many metal-plated rabbits can still be seen scattered on sidewalks, bike lanes and roads. Getting there: From Schwartzkopfstrasse U-Bahn station, walk on Chausseestrasse toward Liesenstrasse. Sonnenallee . At the former Sonnenallee border crossing stands an unassuming artwork known as ""Ubergang -- Nahe und Distanz"" (Crossing -- Proximity and Distance) by Heike Ponwitz. Two pairs of inconspicuous gray telescopes are set up here as a symbol of the mass surveillance that took place during the era of the Berlin Wall. At first glance, the installations resemble the type of telescopes set up at tourist attractions. However, a look through them reveals the word ""Ubergang"" (""crossing"" or ""transfer"") overlaid on the landscape beyond the lens, acting as a disruption to the viewing experience. The word's unexpected appearance is a reminder of the site's historical significance and how the Berlin Wall affected the urban landscape. Getting there: From Baumschulenweg S-Bahn station, take bus 170, 265 or N70 to Sonnenallee and walk along Sonnenallee towards the Sudlicher Heidekampgraben. The Panorama . For a glimpse into what it was like to live with the Berlin Wall, it's worth a visit to ""The Panorama"" by artist Yadegar Asisi. From the outside, the exhibition looks like a large steel-framed cylinder. Inside, there's a compacted view of what daily life was like on both sides of the wall on a fictional fall day. ""In the '80s, I lived on and with the Wall in the Kreuzberg district ... The many scenes from everyday life in the images presented by 'The Panorama' show how the population came to terms with the situation and circumstances,"" says Asisi about his work. Getting there: From Kochstrasse/Checkpoint Charlie U-Bahn station, walk to Friedrichstrasse 205 (entrance on Zimmerstrasse). For visitor information, visit www.asisi.de. Strasse des 17 Juni/Brandenburg Gate . The Brandenburg Gate once represented the separation between East and West Berlin. Since the fall of the wall, it's come to symbolize Germany's reunification. Behind the gate, on Strasse des 17. Juni, stands a three-meter-tall bronze sculpture titled 'Der Rufer' (The Crier) by artist Gerhard Marcks, one of Germany's most renowned 20th-century sculptors. Inscribed on its base is an excerpt from Italian poet Francesco Petrarch: ""I wander through the world and cry, 'Peace, peace, peace'."" Getting there: From Brandenburger Tor S-Bahn station, walk through the Brandenburger Gate toward Strasse des 17. Juni and Tiergarten. Magdalenenstrasse U-Bahn station . In the Magdalenenstrasse U-Bahn station, located on the U5 line, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find walls covered in German expressionist-style murals instead of billboard advertising. Commissioned and installed by the East German government in 1986, the works were painted by artist Wolfgang Frankenstein before the fall of the wall and depict scenes from German history spanning the 1800s to the 1980s.

"Way back in the mists of time, when schoolkids were expected to learn seemingly endless lists of facts off by heart, they chanted a poem to remember the names of England's kings and queens. ""Willie, Willie, Harry, Ste,"" it began. ""Harry, Dick, John, Harry three / One, two, three Neds, Richard two / Harrys four, five, six, then who?"" It then ended with the most recent monarchs: ""Edward seven, George and Ted / George the sixth, now Liz instead."" Of course, it's not done that way any more, but if it were, which name would make it into the next verse? We know that ""Charles"" and ""William"" will follow ""Liz,"" but which name will follow theirs? Long before it was announced that William and Catherine had had a baby boy, speculation about what they'll call the newest addition to the royal family reached fever pitch. Would they pick a name that has already featured in that schoolroom poem? Read more: What will the royal baby look like? ""William and Kate are very much a couple of the 21st century but I think they will stick to traditional names, in keeping with the past,"" Kate's biographer Claudia Joseph told CNN. Whatever the pair pick as the all-important first name, there will be plenty of room to fit in nods to other members of the family too. ""Royals have quite a lot of names,"" said Williams. ""Charles is actually Charles Philip Arthur George, and the Queen is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary. Her father, Bertie, had five names."" Writing for CNN, royal author Andrew Roberts agreed: ""Although we can't know what the child's name will be, we can be sure that he or she will have a lot of them: Some heirs to the throne [have] had as many as seven or eight."" But now we know it's a boy, Williams said the couple's choice was simpler in theory, since there are fewer traditionally ""royal"" male names to choose from. George and James are the current frontrunners with bookmakers, with odds of between 6/4 and 11/4. ""We're very fond of King Georges in this country,"" she said. Read more: Royal baby -- heir for a new century? But the peculiar British royal tradition of switching between names may complicate matters. Prince Charles is expected to be known as King George VII when he ascends to the throne; King George VI was actually christened Albert; and his brother, Edward VIII, who became  Duke of Windsor after his 1936 abdication, was known as David by family and friends. History has also knocked several male names out of the equation: Edward is unlikely, given that scandalous abdication so he could marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, and the various King Richards, Charleses and Johns are viewed as cruel, tyrannical or just downright unpopular.

"(CNN)On the swoop of the Vikersundbakken hill ski jump, it was a case of anything you can do, I can do better. When Peter Prevc soared a massive 250 meters (820 feet) to set a new ski jumping world record in Norway on Saturday, he must have been confident the record would stand for some time. After all, the previous mark had been in the record books for four years and Prevc had soared 3.5 meters (11 feet) further than that. But the Slovenian had barely had a chance to celebrate his place in the annals of ski jumping history when his best effort was eclipsed by Norwegian rival Anders Fannemel. The 23-year-old nudged the record leap another 1.5 meters (5 feet) further Sunday at the same venue. In quotes carried by the FIS website afterward, Fannemel said: ""I thought it would not be possible to jump longer than 250m. Then I saw Dimitry Vassiliev's jump on 254m [in qualifying which he was not able to make stand]. ""The conditions were perfect for long flights and I made the best jump of my life."" It was, however, not enough for the victory, his second jump coming up some way short of the initial mark and Severin Freund won the World Cup instead. Earlier in the weekend, Prevc had been the first non-Scandinanvian since Austria's Andreas Goldberger 15 years ago to set the record. At the time, Prevc had said: ""It's always great to jump far. This win today and the world record is my biggest success so far. ""The speed and the position was perfect then I just landed. Right now, it's hard to describe my feelings, it will probably take a few days."" But Prevc did not have those few days to dwell on his historic landing as Scandinavia wrestled back the record courtesy of Fannemel.","Anders Fannemel breaks ski-jumping world record 24 hours after it is set .

"President Barack Obama, in Hawaii for a weekend economic conference, said Saturday that leaders of nine nations have agreed on the ""broad outlines"" of a trans-Pacific free trade agreement. The United States has been negotiating with Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, Vietnam, Chile and Peru to develop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which officials have said could eventually expand to include other nations. Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Honolulu, Obama pushed the expanded trade deal as a way to help boost investment and exports, create jobs, and ""compete and win in the markets of the future."" The president is on a nine-day trip through the Asia-Pacific region that will include stops in Australia and Indonesia. ""I'm very pleased to announce that our nine nations have reached the broad outlines of an agreement. There are still plenty of details to work out, but we are confident that we can do so. So we've directed our teams to finalize this agreement in the coming year. It is an ambitious goal, but we are optimistic that we can get it done,"" he said, according to remarks provided by his office. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for early next month. Obama said the TPP has the potential to be a model for future trade agreements elsewhere in the world, as it will address issues not covered in previous pacts. It will ensure that state-owned enterprises compete fairly with private companies and address trade and investment in digital technologies. Obama's administration is taking care to highlight the importance of strong Asia-Pacific relations to the president's efforts to create jobs domestically. ""The U.S. exports to this region are essential to the president's goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next several years,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters in a briefing this week. ""In fact, nearly all of the efforts that we're going to be making towards that export goal take place in this part of the world."" The 21 members of APEC account for 55% of the world's gross domestic product, 43% of world trade and 58% of U.S. exports, according to the group. ""So I think when the American people see the president traveling in the Asia-Pacific, they will see him advocating for U.S. jobs and U.S. businesses,"" Rhodes said. ""He will be trying to open new markets, and he will be trying to achieve new export initiatives, and he will be trying to foster a trade agreement through the, for instance, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that takes us beyond the Korea Free Trade Agreement towards a multilateral agreement that, again, has very high standards to ensure that our interests are being protected."" During the weekend conference, Obama was also scheduled to have a discussion with business leaders, as well as side meetings with Russian President Dimitry Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao. Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Saturday. After a break Monday for a political fundraiser, Obama is scheduled to depart Tuesday for Australia and later Bali, Indonesia, where he will stress the U.S. role in the Asia-Pacific region and seek to reassure U.S. allies of the nation's continued commitment to the region, Rhodes said. Speaking to business leaders on Saturday, the president addressed the need to campaign aggressively on behalf of the United States to boost business. ""We've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades. We've kind of taken for granted -- well, people will want to come here and we aren't out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America,"" he said. ""We can do much better than we're doing right now.""","Leaders agree on the outline of a trans-Pacific trade agreement .

"They've been called ""blood phones."" It's a reference to the fact that some metals used to make smartphones and other electronic gadgets are sourced from war-torn areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Experts say these ""conflict minerals"" help fuel one of the world's deadliest conflicts. An estimated 5.4 million people have died there from war-related causes, including disease and malnutrition, since 1998, according to the International Rescue Committee. But according to a report released Thursday by the Enough Project, an advocacy group, metals from the Congo are getting less bloody. That's thanks in part to the fact that tech companies like Intel, HP, Dell, Microsoft and Apple have made efforts to trace the source of metals used in their devices. An auditing system for smelters, the industrial facilities that process raw metals, also has been put in place. A certification system is in the works that would allow companies to certify some metals from Congo as ""conflict free."" Other tech companies, however, like Nintendo, Canon, Nikon, Sharp and HTC, received low rankings from the group. Nintendo was the only company out of 24 ranked by the Enough Project that received a score of zero, for taking no steps to ensure that its electronics do not support armed groups in central Africa. ""Nintendo is, I believe, the only company that has basically refused to acknowledge the issue or demonstrate they are making any sort of effort on it,"" said Sasha Lezhnev, senior policy analyst at the Enough Project. ""And this is despite a good two years of trying to get in contact with them."" In a statement issued to CNN, Nintendo said it ""outsources the manufacture and assembly of all Nintendo products to our production partners and therefore is not directly involved in the sourcing of raw materials that are ultimately used in our products."" The company added: ""We nonetheless take our social responsibilities as a global company very seriously and expect our production partners to do the same."" A Nintendo spokeswoman declined to comment on conflict minerals specifically. Other companies saw their scores improve from a similar report in 2010. Intel ranked highest on the Enough Project's list with a score of 60, meaning it has taken 60% of the steps recommended by the group to ensure it is responsibly tracking conflict minerals. That's up from a score of 24 in 2010. Apple and Microsoft both scored 38, up from 13 and 15, respectively. Nokia scored 35, up from 19. IBM, Sony, LG and Samsung received scores of 27. Three of those companies had received scores lower than 10 in the previous Enough Project ranking. The report says there is still much to be done, however. ""Despite the progress made in the past year by both governments and industry, a long road still lies ahead,"" the group says in its report, titled ""Taking Conflict Out of Consumer Gadgets."" ""Exploitation of Congo's mineral resources continues to exacerbate conflict and instability on the ground and consumers are still largely in the dark as to whether or not their products are conflict free. ""It will take a holistic effort by multiple governments and industries to regulate the flow of illegal conflict minerals. The driver of that effort must remain the demand of the conscious consumer."" The Enough Project says the results are already apparent on the ground in the Congo. The amount of money armed groups make off three of the main conflict minerals (tin, tantalum and tungsten) has dropped 65% over the past two years, according to a report released earlier this month, which attributes the decrease both to the efforts of the tech industry and to new legislation. A rule tucked into 2010 financial reform legislation in the United States may soon require companies to disclose whether they source metals form conflict zones. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to vote on those rules concerning conflict minerals on August 22. Some business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the SEC should reconsider the rules because they are too expensive or complex to implement. Four metals -- gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten -- are used in gadgets and also are mined in the eastern Congo, a region of the vast country that has been in active conflict for years. Armed groups have profited from mining these metals, holding some workers at gunpoint and forcing them to work for little or no pay, according to the group Free the Slaves. New certifications systems, however, aim to attach bar codes to packages of Congolese metals that have been certified as conflict-free. The Enough Project also says there are efforts to differentiate Congolese metals from others by their color and other physical properties. Many challenges remain. The growth of a rebel group called M23 and ongoing gold smuggling threaten to further destabilize the mining industry, the report says. Companies once were ""turning a blind eye to where they're getting their materials from,"" said Lezhnev. But after considerable pressure from advocacy groups and college students, more of them have become aware of the issue. ""Sunshine,"" he said, ""is the best disinfectant.""","Report: Tech companies are making progress on 'conflict minerals'

"Monday was supposed to be Michael Brown's first day at technical college. Instead, his parents were planning his funeral. The 18-year-old was shot by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb on Saturday, sparking a federal civil rights inquiry, local protests and national debate. One side says the African-American teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire. Authorities counter that Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. His parents and their lawyer say they don't believe the police account of what happened. They describe Brown as someone who steered clear of violence. ""He was funny, silly. He would make you laugh. Any problems that were going on or any situation, there wasn't nothing he couldn't solve. He'd bring people back together,"" his father, Michael Brown Sr., told reporters. Family members nicknamed him the ""gentle giant."" For teachers, he was ""a student who loomed large and didn't cause trouble,"" the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Friends and family said the teenager was ecstatic about starting classes at Vatterott College. ""He looked forward to it so much. You didn't have to tell him, 'Make sure you get to school.' He was ready,"" mother Lesley McSpadden told CNN. And he was proud to be setting an example for his younger siblings. ""He was a leader. He knew what he wanted out of life,"" his father said. ""He was a good kid."" He hoped to become a heating and cooling engineer, working on air conditioning, attorney Benjamin Crump, who's representing the teen's family, told reporters. ""Everyone else wanted to be a football player, a basketball player,"" friend Gerard Fuller told the Post-Dispatch. ""He wanted to own his own business. He'd say, 'Let's make something out of nothing.'"" Just a credit shy of graduating high school in May, he earned his diploma on August 1. On graduation day, he told friends he was relieved, according to the newspaper. ""He said he wasn't going to end up like some people on the streets. He was going to get an education,"" Hershel Johnson, a friend of Brown's, told the Post-Dispatch. ""He was going to make his life a whole lot better."" On Facebook, Brown said he liked the St. Louis Rams, Kanye West's music and comedies including ""House Party"" and ""Scary Movie II."" Now a message from a friend posted on Facebook describes Brown as a someone who ""was always there for anybody he knew."" In a Facebook message to a friend last week, Brown wrote: ""If I leave this earth today, at least you'll know I care about others more than I cared about my damn self."" Brown had been spending the summer with his grandmother, Desuirea Harris. ""He was a good kid. He didn't live around here,"" she told CNN affiliate KMOV. ""He came to visit me and they did that to him for no reason."" Crump said Brown was doing the right things, finishing high school and planning for his career ahead. His parents were planning to drop him off at college on Monday. ""And instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral and talk to attorney (Anthony) Gray and I about second autopsies,"" Crump said. At a press conference on Monday, the teenager's parents tearfully described their son to reporters, holding up a photograph showing him as a toddler. ""He was a good boy,"" his father said. ""He didn't deserve none of this."" They asked for supporters to remain peaceful -- something they said their son would have wanted. ""No violence,"" McSpadden said. ""Just justice.""

"Four people were convicted Friday of plotting a knife attack that killed 31 people at a railway station in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming. A court in the city said in an online statement the accused led a terrorist group that planned and executed the attack, which wounded 141 people on March 1. Three were sentenced to death; the fourth to a life in prison. The names of the four suspects suggested they were Uyghur, a mainly Muslim ethnic group from Xinjiang, northwest China.  Authorities had blamed terrorists from the region for the attack. One of the accused stormed the railway station, along with at least four other assailants whom police shot dead at the scene. The attackers wore black and wielded long knives and machetes. State television broadcast an interview with a police officer who was part of the SWAT team dispatched to the railway station, one of China's busiest. ""The person closest to me had his face covered by a black veil. I shot him down when he was about a meter away from my gun. His knife was around 60 or 70 centimeters long,"" the officer told CCTV. The other three who stood trial were caught by police when they were trying to sneak out of the country a few days before the attack, the court said . The train station attack shook the country and state media labeled it ""China's 9/11."" It was the deadliest of a recent spate of violent incidents that have been blamed on Uyghurs. In May, terrorists used car bombs to attack an open-air market in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, leaving 39 dead and 94 injured. Last month, China executed three it said had masterminded an October 2013 suicide car crash in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.","Court says the accused led a terrorist group that planned and executed the attack .

"In response to an incendiary e-mail that drew criticism from online sites and on-campus organizations alike, a Georgia Tech student and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity member has stepped forward and issued an apology in the school's newspaper. The e-mail, which instructed fellow fraternity members on ""luring rapebait"" and contained several references to using alcohol as a means of sexual persuasion, caught the attention of online communities and prompted Georgia Tech and Phi Kappa Tau to issue statements and conduct investigations into the incident. The national chapter of the fraternity temporarily suspended the campus chapter. The sender, identified as Matthew, says he was his chapter's social chair, a position he has since relinquished. In the apology, he claims the e-mail was written as a joke, but should never have been written in the first place. ""Misogynistic behavior is everywhere online and unfortunately, my attempt to ridicule it in an immature and outrageous satire backfired terribly and in a manner I mistakenly underestimated,"" Matthew wrote in Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper. Matthew explained the origin of the e-mail's central term, ""rapebait,"" as a nickname that became an ""internal fraternity joke."" ""In retrospect, it was a nickname I should not have embraced but continuing to use the term was my fault. As a leader I should have put a stop to it in any reference,"" he wrote. ""I know I cannot fix all the damage I have done, but I will strive to become a better man as I work through this episode in my life,"" Matthew said. Matthew ended his e-mail by saying, ""I will conduct myself to more honorably reflect the ideals of Georgia Tech in the future."" The Georgia Tech community has been vocal over the incident. Judging from the comments on the Technique site, the apology seems to have been well-received, with many students even saying the incident was a ""silly joke,"" or a ""tempest in a tea pot.""

"Generations of Britons have grown up pledging to ""Remember remember the fifth of November: Gunpowder, treason and plot"" -- the figure of Guy Fawkes linked forever with fireworks, bonfires and childhood fun. Now -- more than four hundred years after the gruesome death of the man who plotted to blow up the Houses of Parliament with barrels of gunpowder -- members of the Occupy and Anonymous movements are hoping to provide their own reason to remember Guy Fawkes Night. On Saturday, November 5, hundreds of protesters wearing the sinister black and white Guy Fawkes masks plan to march on Parliament in central London. ""It will be a night our government never forgets,"" Malcolm, a member of hacker group Anonymous, said with a smile. ""Our government should be expecting us."" The march will recreate one of the final scenes of ""V for Vendetta,"" a film based on the comic books by Alan Moore about a mysterious masked revolutionary who brings down a totalitarian regime, succeeding where Fawkes failed by blowing up parliament. The Guy Fawkes mask, worn by V, the film's protagonist -- with its diabolical grin, devilish black moustache and thin goatee on a porcelain white background -- has become the talisman of a new generation of activists as an unprecedented wave of disgust and anger with establishment figures has swept the world. While the mask has been spotted in Occupy protests from Oakland to Hong Kong in the past month as people rally against what they perceive as growing corporate greed and rising social inequality, the mask was first embraced by international hacker ring Anonymous in 2008. The group of hackers, notorious for their online attacks on high profile banks and government agencies, first wore the masks to conceal their identities in public protests against the Church of Scientology in 2008. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange recently wore one to a rally at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, where Occupy protesters and members of Anonymous have been camping in tents since the demonstration began three weeks ago. Malcolm, a 44-year-old Anonymous member and camper, says the mask has become ""an international symbol for rebellion and anonymity."" ""The point of wearing the mask is to be able to go to a protest without fear of retribution or aggression from the establishment,"" he said, his mask perched on the crown of his head. ""I have no problem with anyone having my identity, but I like the fact I can choose not to."" Joshua Whitfield, 19, is a fan of the Vendetta books but says it doesn't matter why people choose to wear it. ""Some people wear it to make a fashion statement, others because they know what it's about,"" he said. ""I thought I would show my support for the book and for Anonymous by picking up a mask and being part of the movement."" The popularity of the mask -- an estimated 100,000 were sold last year -- has created a bit of a conundrum for activists who are trying to undermine, not support, businesses owned by the establishment. Time Warner (which also owns CNN) owns the rights to the masks, meaning every mask sold puts more money, albeit a small amount, into the corporation's coffers. Rather than continue to give money to a company they say they don't support, activists are now having their own replica masks mass-produced and shipped in from Asia, according to several Anonymous members. Rather than buy an officially licensed mask at a shop in central London, Whitfield said he was able to purchase his mask from an Anonymous member for £3 ($4.80). ""We don't really want people putting money into corporate pockets, and this is one of our solutions,"" explained Anonymous's Malcolm. In the four centuries since Fawkes was sentenced to death -- by the brutal punishment of being hung, then drawn and quartered -- for his treason, there has been much debate in Britain over whether he was a terrorist or a freedom fighter. Ironically Fawkes, far from being the anti-establishment hero he has come to be seen as in the years since his death, was a monarchist who merely wanted to replace the Protestant king with a Catholic queen. He lived in an age when Europe was split along religious lines, and in England, any sign of allegiance to the pope and Rome could result in imprisonment or even death (indeed, under the later 1701 Act of Settlement, no Roman Catholic or anyone married to a Catholic could be crowned king or queen, a law whose repeal was announced last week). But it is perhaps Fawkes'  ""man of action"" persona that most intrigues anti-establishment activists today, and Malcolm is quick to repeat the age-old adage about Fawkes. ""As they say -- Guy Fawkes was the only man ever to enter Parliament with honest intentions,"" he said with a grin.","Masks popularized by ""V for Vendetta"" film worn by protesters worldwide .

"The Donald Sterling scandal has claimed collateral damage: the president of the NAACP's Los Angeles chapter. Leon Jenkins resigned Thursday, after the civil rights group came under fire for its plans to present a lifetime achievement award to the Los Angeles Clippers owner. Meanwhile on Friday, Sterling's purported girlfriend said through her attorney she was merely a platonic friend, with no sexual relationship with the NBA team owner. Sterling is accused of making racist comments against African-Americans in an audio recording that surfaced last weekend that purportedly depict an argument between Sterling and V. Stiviano. On Friday, Sterling was quoted on DuJour.com as saying ""I wish I had just paid her off"" in reference to Stiviano. The site, which specified that Sterling was referring to Stiviano in a discussion with one of its writers, didn't state when the remark was made. Sterling isn't the only one reeling in the controversy. The uproar also struck one of the nation's leading civil rights groups, the NAACP, whose Los Angeles chapter rescinded Monday its offer to give Sterling a lifetime achievement honor once Sterling's racist remarks came to light. But that reversal was apparently too late. The outcry was too much for the group. ""Please be advised that the legacy, history and reputation of the NAACP is more important to me than the presidency,"" Jenkins said, in announcing his resignation. He said he was stepping down to separate the organization from the ""negative exposure I have caused."" Group's highest honor . The lifetime achievement award is the NAACP's highest honor. The L.A. chapter presented Sterling with the award in 2009, and was planning to do so again this month. Sterling had donated a substantial amount of money to the chapter in the last few years. Some reports put it around $45,000. Earlier this week, the NBA's commissioner came down hard on Sterling, ordering him out of his team's business and pushing to force him to sell over the remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public last weekend. The inflammatory sentiments came packaged in a 10-minute recording that TMZ said occurred during an April 9 conversation between Sterling and girlfriend Stiviano. On the recording, a man and woman argue about photos posted to Instagram in which she appears with African-Americans. The man says he doesn't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her. The sports website Deadspin posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording. 'Giving away integrity' The NAACP and Sterling weren't strangers, and the group had honored Donald Sterling before, an analyst said. ""The first time Sterling was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the group was in the midst of a lawsuit for housing discrimination based upon race,"" said LZ Granderson, a CNN contributor and lecturer at Northwestern University. ""To decide to honor him with the award a second time, after he had paid millions to settle multiple discrimination suits ... is not selling out. Selling out makes financial sense. No, considering what $45,000 means to a man of Sterling's wealth, honoring him with awards is just giving integrity away."" The billionaire real estate mogul has found himself in hot water in the past, denying in court accusations of discrimination tied to the NBA team and to property he owns. A 'social price' to pay . Soon after the scandal broke, Jenkins didn't seem inclined to cut ties with Sterling. ""At some point when there has been proof, I think that would be a legitimate time for the NAACP to sit down with Sterling and try to work out how and why he did what he did and what is he going to do in the future,"" he said. ""God teaches us to forgive. And the way I look at it, after a sustained period of just proof to the African-American community that those words don't really reflect his heart, I think there's room for forgiveness."" By Monday, Jenkins had changed course. ""The revelation that Mr. Sterling may have made comments in a phone conversation that were reminiscent of an ugly time period in American history that contained elements of segregation and racial discrimination demands that the Los Angles NAACP intention to honor Mr. Sterling for his lifetime body of work must be withdrawn, and his donation to the Los Angeles NAACP returned,"" the group said Monday when it withdrew its invitation. ""There is a personal, economic and social price that Mr. Sterling must pay for his attempt to turn the clock back on race relations."" 'Girlfriend' says she was just a pal . On Friday, Stiviano's lawyer said his client wasn't Sterling's girlfriend. Rather, Stiviano was a platonic friend, said attorney Mac E. Nehoray. ""My client was not Donald Sterling's mistress or girlfriend. We have proof that there was no sexual relationship,"" Nehoray said. ""They were more like friends.  Platonic."" When asked why gave Sterling her such lavish gifts as expensive cars, the attorney said: ""Because he cares about her."" Nehoray also stated that Stiviano didn't distribute the recorded conservation. ""She did not leak the recordings,"" the attorney said. ""We are narrowing down who might have leaked the tapes, but we do not want to divulge at this point."" Stiviano doesn't have a book deal connected to the Sterling controversy, Nehoray said. ""There is no book deal. She's been writing a book, but not about Sterling. It's about her life,"" Nehoray said. Stiviano used to work in a crime victims unit in a district attorney's office, Nehoray added. ""When the truth comes out, whoever has been calling her 'gold digger' and 'con artist' will have to retract that -- absolutely false,"" Nehoray said. In March, Sterling's wife sued Stiviano, accusing her having an affair with the billionaire team owner. In the lawsuit, Rochelle Sterling accuses Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. The suit claims that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. Stiviano also took over a $1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $250,000 in cash from Sterling, the court document claims. Stiviano fought back, saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts. She also said she never took advantage of the Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Sterling no stranger to lawsuits . This isn't the first time the Sterlings have been involved in a lawsuit. Elgin Baylor, who was executive vice president and general manager of the Clippers from 1986 to 2008, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination against Sterling in 2009, saying that the team's owner underpaid him and treated him ""as a token because of his race."" Sterling denied those accusations and said the team acted within its rights and ""for good cause and not for any improper reason."" Before the case went to trial, Baylor dropped the racial discrimination claim but maintained accusations of age discrimination. A jury sided with Sterling in 2011. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in 2006 accusing Sterling's rental company of refusing to lease Beverly Hills apartments to African-Americans, refusing to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown section of Los Angeles County and turning away families with children from its properties. That case was settled in 2009, with Sterling agreeing to pay nearly $3 million but continuing to deny the accusations. Then there was a 2003 lawsuit in which the nonprofit Housing Rights Center and a group of tenants who lived in Sterling's properties accused him of ""numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices,"" according to court documents. Among other claims, his accusers said Sterling told building staff that he did not like Hispanic or African-American tenants and that he preferred Korean-American tenants and made ""disparaging comments"" about African-American and Hispanic tenants. Sterling, according to court documents, ""vehemently denied"" the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of ""being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas."" The case was dismissed in 2005 after a settlement was reached. Details of the deal were not disclosed. One of his former tenants, Darryl Williams, videotaped Sterling's wife going door-to-door at the building. Over a decade later, Williams says he's still mystified about what happened and about Sterling himself. ""We rent his buildings, support his basketball team, play on his teams,"" said Williams, who is African-American. ""But he's oblivious to that. As far as he's concerned, he's like a plantation owner.""","Former tenant of Sterling's likens him to ""a plantation owner""

The reason for the trip was a meeting with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev to talk about forming deeper trade and labor alliances between the two countries. This would all seem quite normal and boring if it weren't for the fact that a) nothing is ever normal when it comes to North Korea and, b) Vice happened to also be in the Amur region at the exact same time as Kim Jong Il. But we were there to track down a different kind of North Korean in Siberia: slaves. We had heard through freelance journalist Simon Ostrovsky that North Korea was outsourcing its labor force to work in Siberia as a way to generate much needed hard currency for Kim Jong Il's cash-strapped regime. He reported that camps built to actually look like miniature North Korean villages peppered the remote regions of Russia's Far East and Siberia.  He also reported on the lengthy terms of their labor ""contracts"" and insanely harsh working conditions. So we sent a Vice crew along with Simon to see if we could find some of these camps and talk to some of the North Koreans working there. Most of the camps are very inaccessible so we spent a lot of time on the Trans-Siberian railway to get to the small towns we would use as bases for excursions deep into the forest, looking for work crews. When we finally found the North Korean loggers, their stories were astounding: 10-year labor requirements, living and working out in the bush, Dickensian working conditions, squalid living quarters, inedible food and the majority of their wages garnished and sent back to North Korea to ""help the quality of life there improve."" It was hard to believe that labor camps of this sort still exist in Siberia in 2011, but we saw them with our own eyes. Most of the workers were over 40, meaning that they likely had families back in the home country. So if they tried to escape (many still do) the North Korean government could punish them by sending them to concentration camps or enslaving their families in other work camps. See the rest of North Korean Labor Camps at VICE.COM . When we found out that Kim Jong Il was in the same region making deals for even more of these types of labor arrangements we knew that we had to show what was going on: a dictator trying to sell more of his people, to make more money, to build more nuclear weapons, that he can use to blackmail the West into giving North Korea more aid, thus enabling him to maintain his regime. And this more than anything exemplifies the absurdity of the modern condition. Or at least the bull goose lunacy that is going on in Russia's Far East.","VICE.COM: Labor camps exist in Siberia .

"Hiking! Zip-lining! Rock climbing! About 30,000 Boy Scouts and 7,000 adults are out in the mountains of southern West Virginia for the National Scouts Jamboree -- and they all had to meet a body mass index cut-off. The Boy Scouts of America mandated that no one -- adult or child -- with a BMI of 40 or above could be accepted into the Jamboree, which is taking place July 15-24. This standard is not new; it was in place for the last jamboree as well, said Deron Smith, director of public relations for Boy Scouts of America. ""This policy is not meant to keep anyone out at all, and it's just to make sure that they're safe,"" Smith said. ""We offer thousands of summer camp experiences (that) do not have this requirement."" The Boy Scouts' healthy living initiative has inspired children and adults alike to lose weight, Smith said. The association is encouraging people to live a healthy lifestyle. But that's not how some see it. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, a nonprofit organization, has come out against the Boy Scouts' BMI policy, saying that the organization ""believes that this decision promotes bias and negative attitudes and furthers the discrimination against boys of larger body size."" The organization publicly demanded in a statement that the Boy Scouts ""reconsider their discriminatory practices and admit camp attendees NOT based on their physical fitness, NOT based on their body size, but based on their active status as a boy scout."" Most who could not meet the BMI requirement chose not to apply, Smith said. The organization does not know the number of children impacted. The Boy Scouts have not received any reactions from parents on the BMI issue, he said. For prospective participants who have a slightly lower BMI than 40, but are still obese, there are also special requirements for the jamboree, according to the Boy Scouts' website. The jamboree's medical staff needs a health history, health data and a recommendation from a personal health care provider for children with a BMI between 32 and 39.9, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers to be in the ""obese"" range. How to fix health problems with exercise . Even if the personal health care provider says there aren't any contraindications for participating, that doesn't necessarily mean a person in this BMI range will be able to participate in the whole program, the Boy Scouts' website says. People with a BMI of 31.9 or less need a medical recommendation, too, but don't receive the additional health scrutiny. Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician in Atlanta and CNN's Living Well expert, said she found the restrictions on children with a BMI of over 40 to be somewhat discriminatory. ""Any organization can make their own rules, but as a pediatrician I feel like we should be promoting physical activity for everybody, be as inclusive as possible, and only exclude from activity if there's a physical threat to their health,"" she said. On the other hand, she noted that in some summer programs there are physical activities involving equipment that has a weight or size limit for safety reasons. That should be a restrictive factor for those particular activities, she said, because of the danger to a participant who doesn't meet the requirements. BMI is not a perfect indicator of health and fitness; a BMI of 40 means that the person's weight is much higher than average for his or her height. Muscle can elevate BMI, so some fit people have higher BMIs than normal. Physicians group labels obesity a disease . A BMI as high as 40 is unlikely to be mostly muscle, Shu said, but if there are health issues preventing that person from participating, she believes a doctor should determine that, rather than an organization making a blanket requirement. Shu doesn't look at BMI alone when filling out medical forms for children to participate in summer programs. In addition to evaluating the kids' health, she asks children how they perceive their own abilities in specific activities, such as rock climbing, and doesn't give permission for anything with which the child doesn't feel comfortable. The focus of the jamboree is not on the health requirements, Smith said. ""Our motto is: Be prepared,"" Smith said. ""We're the Boy Scouts. We've been preparing our participants for years for this."" Shu offered a different perspective: ""In general, we'd like to encourage physical activity for everybody."" In her view, that's something the Scouts are not honoring.

"Martin Luther King Jr. Day is celebrated on the third Monday in January, although Dr. King was actually born on the 15th of January 1929, 84 years ago.

We have sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we were being treated. But we come here tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us patient with anything less than freedom and justice. 1 -- In a speech delivered one day before his assassination Dr. King said, ""Let us keep the issues where they are."" Opinion: Martin Luther King's dream is alive . ""That's all this whole thing is about. We aren't engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody.

"The nation paused Monday to remember the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights icon who would have turned 83 this year had a bullet not cut short his life. President Barack Obama marked the holiday with a service project at the Browne Education Campus in Washington on Monday morning. He told the group it was the third year that he, his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha have engaged in some sort of service on King's birthday. While Malia was present Monday, Sasha ""couldn't make it today,"" the president said. ""We're going to be doing a whole bunch of stuff to make the (school) facilities even better than they already are,"" Obama said. He said there is ""no better way"" to honor King's life than by doing something on behalf of others. ""There's nobody who can't serve, nobody who can't help somebody else,"" he said. ""Whether you're 7, or 6, or whether you're 76, you can find the opportunity to make an enormous amount of difference in your community."" Later Monday, the first couple will attend the Let Freedom Ring Celebration at the Kennedy Center. In America blog: Full Martin Luther King Jr. Day coverage . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to speak at the King Day at the Dome rally in Columbia, South Carolina on Monday, according to organizers of the event. The event will ""commemorate Dr. King's life, draw attention to economic and educational equalities in the state, and protest the Confederate battle flag flying in front of the (state capitol) building,"" organizers said. A federal holiday to honor King, who was assassinated in April 1968, was first observed in 1986. In 1994, Congress also designated it a national day of service. On Monday, a group including Washington Mayor Vincent Gray, civil rights activist Dick Gregory and the Rev. Al Sharpton placed a wreath at the memorial honoring King. ""We must be reminded as to why Dr. King has been the one to deserve such a monument and such a holiday,"" Sharpton said. ""... What he did was hold a banner of freedom and equality that actually transformed this nation."" On Sunday, park rangers also placed wreaths at the memorial. Members of King's family stood beside the towering 30-foot statue of him as crowds sang ""Happy Birthday"" at a ceremony. ""We're celebrating the best of what we are, but also what we must become, knowing that we've not arrived there yet,"" Martin Luther King III said. On the civil rights leader's birthday -- January 15, 1968 -- Martin Luther King Jr. was planning a ""poor people's campaign"" to bring together Americans from all walks of life to demand ""decent jobs with decent pay,"" his son said. ""He did not live to see that come to fruition, and so, 44 years later, we're still challenging our nation, particularly in light of the fact that there's so much poverty rampant in this nation,"" Martin Luther King III said. The Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Washington opened to the public last year. Sunday's ceremony came several days after officials confirmed that a controversial quote on one side of the monument would be corrected. The line currently reads: ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."" The quote, which holds a prominent place among more than a dozen King's most notable lines at the site, sparked controversy last summer when poet Maya Angelou said it made the civil rights leader appear arrogant. King's original words, from a 1968 sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, were: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."" Angelou said that leaving out the ""if"" changes the meaning. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has given the National Park Service 30 days to consult with the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, members of the King family and others to decide on a more accurate version of the quote, an official at the Interior Department said last week. King's son said Sunday that he supported the move, because future generations may not know the context of the quote. ""It could be confusing. For us today, no, but for generations yet unborn, they may not understand,"" he said.","President marks day with service project at a Washington school .

"(CNN) -- One goal in eight matches for new club Liverpool, and dumped by the Italian national team. Perhaps the man known as ""Super"" Mario Balotelli isn't feeling quite so super at present. Offloaded by Italian giants AC Milan prior to the start of the season, the 24-year-old is already onto the fourth high-profile club of his fledgling career. And until the striker, painted as a maverick and a trouble maker in the press, proves he can '""carry"" a club, his enormous potential may go unfulfilled, according to Milan director Umberto Gandini. ""Probably Mario has not made the transition yet from being just a fantastic athlete to a great player,"" Gandini told CNN of one of the most talked about players in world football. ""The expectation was probably bigger (at AC Milan), and I think also his expectations, and he has not reached the status yet where he can carry the club. ""Until he will do that he won't be able to fulfill his promises."" Balotelli has struggled to adapt to life back in the English Premier League, scoring just one goal in eight matches for Liverpool since his $25 million move in August. Even his new manager Brendan Rodgers admitted signing the former Inter forward was a ""calculated risk"" given his checkered past, saying the player himself knows this is probably his last chance. Not helping him is the shadow of the man he replaced on Merseyside -- Luis Suarez, now at Spanish club Barcelona. The Uruguayan achieved cult status at the club, scoring 82 goals in 133 appearances, and 31 times last season as the Reds came agonizingly close to a first Premier League title since 1990. And while there are similarities in the way the pair have courted controversy in the past, Balotelli is yet to offered any hint of the potency that punctuated Suarez's stay at the club. He is yet to get off the mark in the Premier League and whether he will play alongside Daniel Sturridge on Sunday against QPR, the England striker having returned to fitness, remains to be seen. Tales of Balotelli's private life dominated his last stint in England and Milan president Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, this week said the striker was signed against his advice, calling him a ""bad apple."" But that is at odds with Gandini's assessment -- that Balotelli is far more professional than he is portrayed -- though he does acknowledge the player is energized by conflict. ""He is much, much better than he is portrayed and his lifestyle was much better than portrayed in England,"" Gandini added. ""He is a fantastic kid, he is humble, and recognizes a lot of values that football has given to him, and life in general. ""I think he loves the fight. He loves to fight with something or somebody -- on the pitch, in life. He's always trying to take the stance.","Milan director Umberto Gandini tells CNN the time was right for Mario Balotelli to leave .

"A much anticipated encounter between President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, came on the sidelines of a lunch held Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day. But a conversation between Putin and Ukrainian President-elect Petro Poroshenko may have been more fruitful. ""We believe it's a good thing they were able to speak, but it's not a substitute for the steps it (Russia) needs to take to deescalate things, especially violence,"" a senior administration official said. ""It's a positive thing that they spoke, but more needs to be done."" The official said Putin has publicly voiced support for Poroshenko, but ""he's not taking steps to back that up."" Putin and Poroshenko's conversation included plans to discuss a cease-fire in the coming days, the office of French President Francois Hollande said. ""It would have to be mutual,"" the administration official said of the cease-fire. ""Not just on the part of the people of Ukraine, but also the Russians."" During their informal aside, Obama told Putin that to reduce tensions in Ukraine, Russia must recognize Poroshenko as the country's legitimate leader and stop supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine. Obama also told Putin that Russia must stop the flow of weapons across the border into Ukraine, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said. Working with the Ukrainian leadership is the only way to reverse Russia's increasing isolation, Obama said, according to Rhodes. ""We didn't think it was the right time, place or circumstances to have a discussion,"" the senior administration official said. ""We believe they haven't legitimately recognized Poroshenko."" The talk lasted 10 to 15 minutes. Speculation had been brewing that the American and Russian leaders would meet, despite apparently elaborate steps taken by Hollande to avoid a tense encounter. On Thursday, he dined with Obama before hosting a separate dinner with Putin. The pair were also seated well apart for the D-Day lunch. With Hollande and the queens of Britain and Denmark between them, the two seemed unlikely to have to converse unless they wanted to. The World War II commemorative events also brought Putin and Poroshenko together in their first face-to-face meeting. They talked briefly before the leaders went to the D-Day lunch. German Chancellor Angela Merkel stood with them as they spoke. Putin and Poroshenko shook hands before their informal exchange, Hollande's office told CNN. No interaction was seen between Obama and Putin at that point. 'Lane of international law' Speaking Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, Obama said he and Putin were likely to cross paths in France, although no formal meeting was planned. Obama said then that if they spoke, he would give Putin the same message on Ukraine that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements. Putin ""has a chance to get back into a lane of international law,"" he said. Obama said Putin could start by recognizing Poroshenko, stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. Putin, in an interview with French television station TF1, did not discount the possibility of meeting with Obama. ""As for my relations with Barack Obama, I have no reason whatsoever to believe he is not willing to talk to the President of Russia,"" he said. ""But ultimately, it is his choice. I am always ready for dialogue, and I think that dialogue is the best way to bridge any gaps.""","Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin speak on the sidelines of a D-Day lunch .

"(CNN) -- Authorities evacuated thousands from a Chicago-area hotel Sunday after guests complained that a noxious odor was spreading. Now detectives are investigating, and police say it appears that ""an intentional act"" was behind high levels of chlorine gas that forced the evacuation at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in Rosemont, Illinois, early Sunday morning. The hotel was hosting the Midwest FurFest, a convention where many attendees don animal costumes and ""celebrate furry fandom, that is, art, literature and performance based around anthropomorphic animals,"" according to the event's website. Video from CNN affiliate WGN shows guests dressed as foxes, tigers and bears spilling onto the streets as fire trucks and hazmat crews arrive. Nineteen people who suffered from nausea and dizziness were treated and transported to area hospitals, officials said. ""This incident is being treated as a criminal matter,"" the Rosemont Public Safety Department said in a statement. On Twitter, organizers of the annual conference said they were looking for tips about what happened. Investigators detected a high level of chlorine gas in the air when they arrived at the hotel around 1 a.m., officials said. Hazmat teams found the source of the smell in a stairwell on the hotel's ninth floor: a ""substance, consistent in odor and appearance to powdered chlorine,"" the public safety department said. In a statement Sunday, convention organizers said guests were allowed to return to their rooms several hours after the evacuation. ""In the course of investigating the scene, the Rosemont Police Department determined that this was a criminal act and began investigating it as such. This delayed allowing our guests back into the hotel,"" the statement said, describing the situation as an ""unfortunate incident."" Refunds will not be offered, organizers said, ""because this was an unforeseen possibly criminal act.""

"One of my law professors once told our class: I'd rather be rich and guilty than poor and innocent. Maybe he was right. In Texas, in the courtroom of Judge Jean Boyd, not only can the wealthy afford top-notch attorneys and experts, they are afforded their very own legal defense. It's called ""affluenza."" Ethan Couch is a 16-year-old troubled teen who drove drunk and killed four innocent people. He lost control of his Ford F-350 truck, rolled it and slammed into them as they tried to fix a disabled car on the road's shoulder in a Fort Worth suburb.  One of his seven teen passengers was thrown from the truck and permanently paralyzed. He can only communicate by blinking. Prosecutors had sought the maximum sentence of 20 years in state custody. In court, paid experts on Couch's behalf argued he suffered from ""affluenza"" -- a previously made-up diagnosis not even recognized by the American Psychiatric Association -- and that his behavior was excused because of how he was raised. Opinion: The cure for ""affleunza"" is prison . The theory was that Couch was not to blame for his actions because his rich parents gave him too much, never set limits for him, and he never learned consequences for his actions. His parents and his family's wealth were to blame, they argued. The defense is ridiculous. And the judge's decision -- despicable. Couch was not sentenced to a Texas juvenile detention center. Instead, he was sentenced to 10 years probation and is required to enter into a private counseling center to receive one year of rehab. The posh California facility his attorneys have recommended will reportedly cost his parents $450,000. There are no locks. There are no fences. There is, however, yoga, nutrition courses, horseback riding and cooking classes. Welcome to Ethan Couch's world. Where the same privilege that justified him killing four people allows him to walk away with virtually no consequences. The message this case sends about our criminal justice system and personal responsibility is chilling. There really are two systems of justice -- one for the rich, and one for those other people. There really is a double standard. Related: Affluenza, is it real? The purpose of juvenile justice is not solely rehabilitation. It's also to teach young people about accountability and consequences so that they won't continue to offend. It's also about punishment when teens kill and hurt others. Judge Boyd knows this. She heard a case last year where a 14-year-old African-American teen punched someone once; the person tragically died two days later. Judge Boyd ruled that the teen could get his services and counseling while sentencing him to Texas juvenile detention with the possibility of adult prison for up to 10 years. That was for one punch. Ethan drove his truck 70 mph with a .24 blood alcohol content (three times the legal limit for an adult), killed four people, and got 10 years probation. And yoga classes. The scales of justice are clearly on one side here. Our juvenile system is full of teens from challenging backgrounds. Many are born to parents who neglected them, abused them or didn't teach them right from wrong, who in some cases fended for themselves at very young ages. But, unlike Ethan Couch, they don't suffer from affluenza. They are poor and, too often, they are black. They're disenfranchised. Off to jail they go. Their backgrounds may offer explanations for their actions, but they don't justify them.  So why should Ethan's? Judges often use their sentencing to set an example and send a message. If that's the case, wouldn't the best cure for affluenza be to deprive Ethan Couch of his wealth? Humble him. Not give him special treatment in world-class facilities and reinforce the message that he's different and not like the rest of us. Send him to juvenile detention where he can get services, but also protect society by not allowing him the opportunity to kill others. Justice is not blind in Judge Boyd's courtroom. Ethan is being granted a privileged outcome based on his privileged background. And prosecutors should challenge this sentence as outrageously lenient. Ethan Couch is not being held accountable. Judge Boyd should be.","Faith Jenkins calls judge's decision in the ""affluenza"" drunk driving case ""despicable""

Jonathan said he plans to make a formal declaration about his candidacy Saturday.

""Far from it. What I do promise is this -- if I am elected president in 2011, I will make a covenant with you, the Nigerian people, to always do right by you, to tell you the truth at all times, to carry you along and most importantly to listen to you, fellow citizens in our communities, and also those of you on this page.""

"(CNN)Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie married over the weekend in France, a representative for Jolie confirmed Thursday. The couple, who are the parents of six children, have been together for almost a decade. They got married Saturday in a small, private ceremony in a chapel at Château Miraval in the village of Correns. Pitt and Jolie have been the source of speculation about their relationship almost since the beginning. Tongues first started wagging after the pair met on the set of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" in the summer of 2004, when Pitt was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt to co-star in 'By the Sea' In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced that they were splitting. Aniston filed for divorce in March 2005. The following month, photos surfaced of Pitt, Jolie and her adopted son Maddox together in Kenya. Jolie later adopted daughter Zahara from an orphanage in Ethiopia and in early 2006 she announced that she and Pitt were expecting a baby. Shortly thereafter, Pitt was granted the right to legally adopt Maddox and Zahara. Their daughter Shiloh was born in May 2006 and son Pax was adopted from an orphanage in Vietnam in March 2007. Jolie gave birth to twins Vivienne and Knox in July 2008. The couple announced their engagement in 2012. Pitt and Jolie recently told People that the wedding would be a family affair. ""We are discussing it with the children and how they imagine it might be,"" Jolie said. ""Which is verging on hysterical, how kids envision a wedding...They will, in a way, be the wedding planner. It's going to be Disney or paintball -- one or the other!"" According to a statement from the family ""Angelina was walked down the aisle by her eldest sons Maddox and Pax. Zahara and Vivienne threw petals, gathered from the garden. Shiloh and Knox were the ring bearers."" ""In the days before coming to France, and as citizens of California, Brad and Angelina filled out their paperwork and obtained a marriage licence from a local judge, who also travelled to France to conduct the ceremony at Chateau Miraval,"" the statement said. ""They are therefore married under Californian law."" Brad Pitt: Angelina is 'sexy as ever' The uniting of Pitt and Jolie in matrimony has been one of the most anticipated marriages in Hollywood. In 2006 Pitt told Esquire magazine that he and Jolie would not marry until ""everyone else in the country who wants to be married is legally able."" He reaffirmed their commitment to marriage equality in a 2011 interview with People. ""Thanks to the tireless work of so many, someday soon this discrimination will end and every American will be able to enjoy their equal right to marriage,"" Pitt said in a statement to the magazine following the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York State.

"A Honduran radio journalist has been found executed, authorities said -- the 22nd journalist to be killed in the nation since 2010. As he drove to work last week, Alfredo Villatoro Angel was kidnapped by six unknown people traveling in two vehicles, police said. His body was found Tuesday night. ""He had two shots to the head, and his face was covered with a red bandanna,"" Security Ministry spokesman Ivan Mejia said. Dozens of relatives, co-workers and government officials flocked to the morgue in Tegucigalpa in solidarity. Video showed dozens of people crying and holding each other. Villatoro is the latest in what the Committee to Protect Journalists this month called a ""wave of violence and intimidation against journalists."" According to the media freedom organization, an atmosphere of violence and impunity has made Honduras one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. ""A climate of unrelenting hostility toward Honduran journalists is restricting the flow of news and eroding citizens' right to information,"" Carlos Lauría, the Committee to Protect Journalists' senior program coordinator for the Americas, said last week. ""This situation endures because Honduran authorities have yet to take decisive action to enforce the law and guarantee the safety of journalists."" According to the United Nations, Honduras has the highest homicide rate per capita in the world. Danilo Izaguirre, who was Villatoro's companion at National Radio Honduras (HRN by its Spanish initials), said journalists will continue their work, despite the message the killers are sending. ""If it (the message) is to shut up, I will not be silent. If it is about speaking the truth, we'll tell the truth anywhere we are located, from any trench, from anywhere,"" he said. President Lobo, who took office in 2010, urged journalists not to be intimidated and said the government will continue to fight crime. But according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Lobo's government has minimized crimes against journalists and has been slow in bringing the killers to justice. According to the country's Public Ministry, only five cases relating to journalist killings are being processed, and no one has been convicted. ""This is serious, especially the degree of impunity ... in these cases of death and threats against journalists and the media. That tells the world that we have failed in criminal investigations,"" said Andres Pavon, president of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras.","Alfredo Villatoro was found with two gunshot wounds to the head .
He is the 22nd journalist killed in Honduras since 2010 .

"Paul Oliver, a former defensive back for the University of Georgia and the San Diego Chargers, was found dead this week, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot. His death marks the latest in a string of suicides among former professional football players. ""Everyone in the Chargers family is sad today after hearing the news about Paul,"" a statement from the NFL team said. ""He was part of our family for five years. At just 29 years old, he still had a lifetime in front of him. Right now all of our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this most difficult time."" A tale of two former NFL players -- and their brains . Oliver leaves behind a wife and two children, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. ""We appreciate all the thoughts and prayers,"" Oliver's family said in a statement to The San Diego Union-Tribune. ""We request privacy in the wake of this tragic loss."" Mark Richt, coach of the University of Georgia Bulldogs, called it ""a very sad day."" ""I just want to say it's been rough,"" he told reporters. ""I just want to tell everybody in his family that we're thinking about them and we love them. We'll do whatever we can to help."" Police found Oliver's body Tuesday night at the bottom of a set of stairs in a home in Marietta, Georgia, Cobb County police spokesman Sgt. Dana Pierce said.  A family member had called 911. The county medical examiner ruled the death a suicide by handgun and gave police authorization to release the cause. Opinion: Junior Seau was hurting and didn't know how to say it . Oliver played for the Chargers from 2007 to 2011, recording 144 tackles in 57 games. A former teammate, Eric Weddle, described Oliver as ""charismatic, funny but also quiet and reserved,"" The Union-Tribune reported.  ""He never said a bad word about anyone. Just a good, genuine guy."" Oliver's high school coach in Georgia, Bruce Cobleigh, said Oliver was a leader. ""This is a real tough situation for everybody because this isn't Paul,"" Cobleigh told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""This is surprising, shocking. He was really outgoing. He was really well-liked, a leader, hard, hard worker.' Cobleigh said he hadn't talked with his former player in recent years as much as when he was in Georgia, but the coach had fielded calls much of Wednesday from former teammates of Oliver who were all surprised by his death. The circumstances of his apparent suicide were not immediately clear. Suicides of some other former NFL players involved brain injuries. Former NFL player wants brain studied . Star NFL linebacker Junior Seau was 43 when he took his own life in May 2012. The National Institutes of Health later found he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head. A study published in December in the journal Brain looked at brain tissue of 34 professional football players after they died. All but one showed evidence of disease. NFL Concussions Fast Facts . In April 2012, former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, 62, committed suicide.  An autopsy found signs of CTE. In February 2011, former Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson, 50, committed suicide with a gunshot to the chest, rather than his head, so his brain could be researched for CTE. Boston University researchers found the disease in his brain. In December 2012, Jovan Belcher of the Kansas City Chiefs killed his girlfriend before taking his own life. His remains were not tested for CTE, media reports said. The NFL launched a crisis support line in July 2012 for players, former players and their families. Called NFL Life Line, it operates independently from the NFL and promises to keep all calls confidential.

"The last time Rafael Nadal came back from a long-term layoff, he enjoyed one of the finest seasons of an outstanding career -- reaching nine consecutive finals on his return from a knee injury, and winning both the French and U.S. Open grand slams in 2013. On Tuesday, the Spaniard took to the court for the first time in three months and looked as though he had never been away as he blitzed past Frenchman Richard Gasquet at the China Open. Needing just 78 minutes to win 6-4 6-0 in the opening round, the world No. 2 appeared to feel no effects of the right wrist injury he suffered while practicing at home in Mallorca in late July. ""In general, I have to be happy the way that I played,"" Nadal, a 14-time grand slam winner, told the official ATP Tour website. ""After three months without a match, winning against a good player like Richard is a very positive comeback for me. I think I played solid, no mistakes."" Nadal, who presented Li Na with a bouquet of flowers as China said goodbye to its biggest tennis star on Tuesday, had not played since his surprise fourth round defeat by Australian Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon on July 1. His problematic wrist meant he was unable to defend his title at this month's U.S. Open, where Croatia's Marin Cilic emerged as a surprise winner. ""More important than winning or losing is spending time on court. That's the key for me at the moment: spending time on court, playing matches,"" said Nadal. ""At least I am going to play two matches minimum here. That's a positive thing. I'm going to try my best to play three."" The 28-year-old has returned to action even though he says his wrist is not quite 100% healed. Nadal has a decent record in Beijing -- having won the China Open in 2005 and Olympic gold in 2008. Last year, he finished runner-up as Novak Djokovic won his fourth China Open title. The Serb took his record in Beijing to 20-0 when beating Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-2 6-1 as Djokovic played his first match since being stunned by Japan's Kei Nishikori in the U.S. Open semifinal.","Rafael Nadal beats Richard Gasquet at the China Open on his return from injury .

"(CNN) -- In August 2008, Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-American, and two friends from his high school in Queens flew from Newark, New Jersey, to Peshawar, Pakistan, where they hoped to join the Taliban. In Peshawar, the trio met with ""Ahmad,"" an al Qaeda operative who put them in touch with two al Qaeda leaders. Those leaders asked the three from Queens to participate in attacks against the United States. Zazi refused. He wanted to fight the U.S. military in the fields and mountains of his homeland, not to kill American civilians in the streets of his adopted country. So, according to American prosecutors, al Qaeda's leaders brought in someone more persuasive -- someone who could speak to Zazi in his own language, someone who had also grown up on the streets of New York City in the 1990s, a man who had had a meteoric rise in the ranks of al Qaeda over the past decade from camp dishwasher to the leader of the group's operations in the West. His name was Adnan Shukrijumah. Eventually Shukrijumah would be added to the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists"" list and a $5 million reward would be put on his head. And on Saturday, Shukrijumah was killed in Pakistan by the Pakistani military. Shukrijumah was born in Saudi Arabia in 1975, but his family moved to Trinidad in the '80s and then to Brooklyn in the early '90s. In 1995, Shukrijumah's family left New York for the Fort Lauderdale area in Florida, where he did odd jobs like selling used cars, earning money that he used to pay for his studies in chemistry and computer science at Broward Community College. Some Muslim men in Florida gave Shukrijumah books and videos about the holy wars in Kashmir and Afghanistan, and he was so moved by these stories of holy war that in late 1999 he traveled to Afghanistan to attend an al Qaeda training camp. Around this time, Shukrijumah told his mother that he was opposed to what he considered the excesses of the West, such as alcohol and drug abuse as well as the skimpy clothes that women wore in Florida. In May 2001, he left Florida again, and by June he was back in Afghanistan. Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Shukrijumah called his mother in Florida, saying, ""Did you hear what happened? They are putting it on the Muslims."" His mother advised him not to come back to the States, and she said in 2010 he did not contact her again. It was Shukrijumah who, in late 2008, made the pitch to Zazi and his buddies from Queens -- Zarein Ahmedzay, another Afghan-American, and Adis Medujanin, a cab driver of Bosnian descent -- that they could help the cause of holy war best if, instead of fighting alongside the Taliban's tens of thousands of fighters, they went back to the States after their training by al Qaeda's bomb-makers and launched attacks there. At the time that Shukrijumah was making his pitch to the trio from Queens, the CIA drone war in the tribal regions of Pakistan was heating up. It was the last six months of President George W. Bush's second term, and the Bush administration had significantly amped up the drone program. Angered by the CIA drone program, Zazi agreed to return to the States to launch an attack. He also volunteered to be a suicide bomber, as did his two friends. They discussed with Shukrijumah potential targets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Times Square, as well as a Walmart store. Zazi returned to New York in mid-January 2009. He had been living on the Afghan-Pakistan border for five months, during which time he had been in almost continuous contact with members of al Qaeda. He was now ready to launch what al Qaeda's leadership hoped would be the most lethal terrorist attack in the States since 9/11. Luckily, Zazi's plan to blow up bombs in the Manhattan subway around the time of the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks was detected by U.S. intelligence agencies that were monitoring the email account of a known al Qaeda operative in Pakistan who was in touch with Zazi. Zazi and his two friends were arrested before they could carry out the plot. It was Shukrijumah who oversaw this plot. After all, who better to oversee al Qaeda plots to attack the States than someone who had grown up in Brooklyn and Florida? A Pakistani army spokesman said on Twitter on Saturday that Shukrijumah was killed in South Waziristan along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. The fact that Shukrijumah is now dead makes the United States a little bit safer from al Qaeda's plotting. And the fact that Shukrijumah was killed in a Pakistani military operation is a sign that Pakistan continues to expand its operations against militants based on its border with Afghanistan in a meaningful way, which has long been a demand of the United States. Finally, Shukrijumah's death is indicative of how al Qaeda's core organization that launched the 9/11 attacks continues to dwindle in size and capacity, because almost all of its leaders are now dead or captured. The elimination of almost all of al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan suggests that the once-global organization may become just another Pakistani-based jihadi group with limited or no ability to operate outside of South Asia.","Pakistan kills an American al Qaeda commander who was on FBI ""Most Wanted"" list .

"The ex-husband of an American woman killed in the United Arab Emirates said he was shocked by her fatal stabbing, but still feels safe there despite the bloody attack. ""I'm totally horrified by what happened,"" Paul Ryan said. ""One just needs to look at the video, the images of that bathroom, and it knocks you out. It knocks you out,"" he said. ""I still hope my children have not seen that, those beautiful children, I have to make sure ... I protect them as best I can."" A veiled woman attacked Ibolya Ryan, 47, on Monday in a restroom of a high-end mall in Abu Dhabi. She was killed with a sharp object during a fight in the women's restroom, local authorities said. Police later arrested a female Emirati national of Yemeni descent, whom they described as a suspect. Paul Ryan arrived in Abu Dhabi last week to be reunited with his 11-year-old twin boys. He also has a 13-year-old daughter. ""I'm still fearful of all of that,"" he said, referring to his ex-wife's attack. ""However, I have come to feel it is quite different. I'm starting to believe what my ex-wife was always telling me -- that it's safe."" 'They are treating me like family now' Ryan said the the nation's authorities have gone out of their way to ensure his family is taken care of, and have offered to pay for the three children's education through college. ""They are treating me like family now,"" he said. ""They have expressed almost precisely in these terms, the children will not have to worry about their education, for their entire education basically."" Ryan has the power to commute the death sentence and grant a pardon if the suspect is found guilty and handed capital punishment. The burden weighs heavily on him, he said. ""I can't believe I have the power to pardon, that is shocking to me. I don't want this responsibility,"" he said. ""As far as I can tell, it seems pretty damning evidence and she (the suspect) confessed herself. Ibolya, my dear ex-wife, and I do mean that, will not have died in vain."" Veteran teacher . Ibolya Ryan was born in Romania and held Hungarian and American citizenship. She had been a teacher for 17 years, according to a Footprints Recruiting profile of her. Paul Ryan has created a Facebook page to honor his ex-wife's memory. In September last year, Ibolya Ryan began teaching in Abu Dhabi, where she lived with her children. Before that, she taught special education in her ex-husband's native Colorado. Surveillance video released by police shows the moments before and after the mall stabbing. A veiled figure police identified as the attacker walks calmly through a parking lot entrance, speaks to security guards and picks up a paper before disappearing around the corner out of sight. The video later shows the suspect running to an elevator and leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors. Reem Island, where the attack occurred, is a newly developed area popular with expatriates in  the capital. The motive of the killing was unclear.","Ibolya Ryan, 47, was killed in a mall restroom in  Abu Dhabi .

"Eighty years -- that's about how long it took the state of Alabama to posthumously pardon the last three of nine men who were falsely accused and wrongly convicted of raping two white women on a train. They infamously were called the Scottsboro Boys, because the nine black men were just 12- to 19-years-old when they were arrested in 1931. It turned out that the women, Ruby Bates and Victoria Price, had lied to police about the rapes. At one of the trials, Bates recanted her testimony, saying she had made it all up. Still, the all-white jury convicted the boys, one after another. Forty-three years later, a similar story: This time it was Delbert Tibbs, who died recently of cancer. Tibbs spent nearly three years in prison in Florida after he was convicted in 1974 of a rape and murder that he had nothing to do with, according to the Florida Supreme Court. Ancient history, you say? We've moved past those shameful days of unequal justice, you insist. Think again. In 2012, according to the FBI, nearly 87,000 ""forcible rapes"" were reported. That's down 7% from the number of rapes reported in 2008. Law enforcement agencies estimate that the number of false rape accusations ranges from 2% to 8% annually, or between 2,000 and 7,000 cases each year. Exact numbers are difficult to track because of the lack of in-depth research on false rape cases and because of the varying definitions of what constitutes an ""unfounded"" rape claim. It can mean the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect or suffer injuries, was not threatened with a weapon or the victim and perpetrator had a previous relationship. Law enforcement experts agree that rapes are widely underreported, and no one is suggesting that violence against women isn't a serious problem. But experts do not dispute that false rape accusations can and do happen. Many of those innocent men end up in prison or with lives shattered. One of the unfortunate statistics . In 2002, Brian Banks was one of those unfortunate statistics. He was just 17 when a classmate, Wanetta Gibson, 15, falsely accused him of raping her at school. Banks, then a top football talent, spent more than five years in prison and five years on probation for rape and kidnapping. He was exonerated after he got his accuser to admit on tape that she lied about the rape. Banks later explained that his attorney had advised him to take a plea bargain and avoid a jury trial because ""... I was a big black teenager, and no jury would believe anything I said."" The Long Beach Unified School District sued his accuser, and she has been ordered to repay the $750,000 she was awarded in a lawsuit against the district. It seems more men who insist they have been falsely accused of rape are trying a new tactic: suing their accusers in civil court, mostly for defamation. They are seeking to repair their ruined lives, save their careers and clear their names. Make no mistake, I could never defend men who rape and believe even harsher penalties are needed for rapists. But I can understand why some men are opting to fight back. And I even agree with this strategy in some cases. TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington is fighting back. Arrington is suing his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Allen, after she accused him in 2012 on Facebook and Twitter posts of  physically abusing her and raping one of her friends (who later denied this). The case is pending. Recently, it sounded as if Heisman Trophy winner and Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston, who was accused of raping a fellow student, and his legal team were also considering this strategy. His attorney, Tim Jansen, said that they have not ruled out a civil suit of their own. ""His reputation is important to him,"" Jansen said after his client was cleared when the state attorney said no charges would be filed. ""His career is important to him."" The accuser's attorney has requested a review of the case by the Florida attorney general's office and argues that the Tallahassee Police Department tried to stymie the rape investigation of the star athlete. Throughout the investigation, Winston insisted that the sex was consensual. And his unidentified accuser equally insisted she was raped but was heavily intoxicated and had a ""broken memory"" of events. However, toxicology reports found no drugs in her system and very low alcohol levels. Complicating the case further, Winston's DNA was found on the woman's underwear and a second DNA sample, reportedly from her boyfriend, was found on her shorts. No simple solution to clearing your name . Admittedly, my initial reaction to hearing no charges would be filed was relief. For me, the case was troubling on both sides. And though I'm no lawyer, I thought: ""Winston should sue his accuser. If he's really innocent, he should prove it and clear his name."" But it may not be that simple. Xavier Donaldson, a defense attorney and former assistant district attorney in New York, warns that while initiating these lawsuits against accusers may seem like a good way for men who are wrongly accused to get justice, he'd be hard-pressed to advise any of his clients to pursue this strategy. ""It's a very sensitive issue, and these suits should be extremely case specific, extremely rare. ... You can't win these cases, too much backlash,"" Donaldson said. His advice to Winston: ""Move on with your life, remain above the scandal, and focus on school and following your dream to play in the NFL."" I asked Donaldson what about the thousands of men who are wrongly accused -- just ignore them? ""Look, I tell my clients innocent before proven guilty is not reality. It's more of a marketing slogan to promote faith in our justice system; without that premise, the system would fall apart,"" he said. He also said it could  ""discourage too many from reporting real rapes."" It sounds to me like ancient history repeating itself. It sounds to me like we  have a very long way to go before there's justice for all.","Roxanne Jones:  2% to 8% of rape accusations are ""unfounded""

"Hillary Clinton sought to clarify her ""dead broke"" comment that generated a critical reaction in social media and energized her detractors, saying simply that she and her husband have known periods in their lives when they struggled financially to pay off debt. In another interview as her new memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" hit bookstores on Tuesday, Clinton found herself again talking about her immediate post White House years when the former first family owed millions to lawyers and had nothing in the bank as they transitioned to a new life. In an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that aired on Monday, Mrs. Clinton said she and former President Bill Clinton were ""dead broke"" and ""struggled to piece together the resources"" for mortgages in pricey Washington and the New York suburbs and their daughter Chelsea's tuition at prestigious Stanford University. Clinton made the comments in defense of the hefty speaking fees she now commands as she weighs a presidential bid. Clinton told Robin Roberts on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that she understood the critical reaction to her comments, but remembers that they were  ""something like $12 million in debt"" in the winter of 2001. ""Let me just clarify that I fully appreciate how hard life is for so many Americans today. It is an issue that I have worked on and cared about my entire adult life,"" said Clinton, who later noted that getting out of post-White House debt ""was something that we really had to work hard"" to accomplish. She also said that she and Bill Clinton had to support themselves at a young age and pay for college, too. ""We understand what that struggle was because we had student debts, both of us, we had to pay off, we had to work,"" Clinton said. ""We have a life experience that is clearly different in very dramatic ways from many Americans, but we also have gone through some of the same challenges as many people have."" The Clintons righted their financial circumstances reasonably quickly by capitalizing on the expected post-presidential windfall of book deals and speaking fees. The new book . ""Hard Choices"" is about Clinton's years as President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, which she stepped away from early last year. In her ABC appearances, she honed what is likely to be her book tour message -- one of a thoughtful diplomat who is prepared to reintroduce herself to voters, especially women. With her book lining the walls of booksellers nationwide, Clinton stopped at a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan for her first book signing of the two-week tour. Flanked by Clinton devotees, many of whom waited overnight to get a copy signed by the former first lady, Clinton said she wrote the book ""for anybody who wants to think about and learn about what is happening in the world today, why America matters, and why the world matters to America."" She was forward looking in her brief remarks, telling that audience that ""we have a lot of hard choices ahead of us in our country to make it as great and strong as it should be."" Outside Barnes & Noble, many in line saw themselves not just waiting for the first event of a book tour. Instead, they saw this as the kickoff to Clinton's new political future. ""I see it as the beginning of her campaign, and I think a lot of people do,"" said Susan Kellman of Brooklyn, who waited with her daughter overnight to be one of the first in line. ""I think everybody is hopeful that that's what it is. So it's nice to be here at the beginning."" Security was tight at the event and attendees were warned beforehand that Clinton would not be personalizing each book and would not pose for photos. Book buyers, however, were happy to wait as long as they got to meet the former senator. ""I would love to get a picture, but I understand,"" said Natia Mosashvili as she waited in line. Monica, Benghazi, presidential politics . On Monday, Clinton was asked by Sawyer about Monica Lewinsky, the one time White House intern whose affair with the President in the mid 1990s set the stage for his impeachment and launched a wave of books, TV specials, and yet another chapter of scandal. Lewinsky resurfaced last month because of a Vanity Fair essay in which she reflected on her infamy and her life after the saga. ""She is perfectly free to do that,"" Clinton said about Lewinsky's essay. ""She is, in my view, an American who gets to express herself however she chooses. But that is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about."" Clinton added that she has ""moved on"" and if she had the chance to talk to Lewinsky she would ""wish her well."" ""I hope that she is able to think about her future and construct a life that she finds meaning and satisfaction in,"" Clinton concluded. Much of the Sawyer interview focused on Clinton's tenure at the State Department, including her relations with Russia, sanctions imposed on Iran and the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton, as she has done before, portrayed herself as someone who moved the ball forward on diplomatic issues, not someone who fixed everything. ""Let's talk about what was accomplished and then talk about the continuing threats,"" Clinton said when pressed about her State Department record. On Benghazi, Republicans contend that the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans illustrates Obama administration foreign policy failures. Democrats say ongoing Republican-led scrutiny is political and designed to undercut any potential Clinton candidacy. ""I view this as really apart from -- even a diversion from -- the hard work that the Congress should be doing about the problems facing our country and the world,"" Clinton said, noting that the U.S. should be ""in the majors"" on world affairs. Clinton has taken responsibility before for what happened in Benghazi, and she did so again in the interview.  She also defended herself by saying she ""was not making security decisions"" for the Benghazi compound. Roberts pressed Clinton Tuesday about her record at the State Department and whether she will distance herself from Obama if she runs for president. ""Where I disagree with President Obama, I will be clear,"" Clinton said. ""But in many areas, he and I worked together and I think we saw positive results. I am very proud of what we did during the time that I was there."" Republicans have seized on a number of comments from Clinton's interviews and book rollout, but none more than her comments about the family's finances. American Rising, the pro-Republican opposition research shop that, along with the Republican National Committee, takes the lead in criticizing Clinton, was quick to ping her over her comments to ABC, saying they ""reveal someone who is extremely out of touch with financial reality facing Americans."" And on running, Clinton told Sawyer she would ""decide when it feels right for me to decide."" She also entertained the idea of not running. ""I like what I am doing,"" she said.

Consider these my gift to you. Take a deep breath and smile . If the thought of attending yet another wedding doesn't fill your heart with happiness like it does mine, try to remember: . This is your friend.  And he or she has asked you to participate in one of the biggest days of his or her life.  This is a good thing. Weddings are not an exercise established to stress you out or bring you down, and if you've been lucky to have been included in any part of the day, well, then, smile, because that means you're someone's friend! Smiles and deep breaths also help when it's time to fork over your cash and kiss your precious vacation days goodbye. Be realistic and honest . After the squeals and hugs and ""I'd be honoreds"" are over, the sometimes-uncomfortable conversations about what's expected of you as a member of the wedding party will inevitably follow. Anja Winikka is the site director for the popular wedding website TheKnot.com.  She advises wedding guests -- that's right, guests -- to ""get organized"" when it comes to attending a wedding. ""If you know you have a wedding coming up in August and you know there will be expenses coming up, you may have to cut back in other areas,"" Winikka said.  ""Map out your calendar and set a budget."" Once you know what's expected of you as a guest or attendant and you've taken inventory of your budget, communicate any worries you might have to the bride or groom.  Let them know what you can do and, more important, what you can't.  If you're having trouble making rent, for example, an extravagant bachelorette party in the Virgin Islands is probably not feasible. Ask the dress shop whether you can set up a payment plan to make monthly contributions toward your wedding wardrobe. Once the date is set, book your flight and hotel rooms early to avoid high fares. Whatever you do, let the bride and groom know where you stand. Flaking at the last minute because you can't afford it is a guaranteed way to put a friendship in turmoil. Get choosy . I'm not one for putting a hierarchy on friendships, but when it comes to minding your finances and attending weddings, you can't do it all.  So it's OK to be selective when it comes to whose wedding invitation you accept and whose you decline. We all know about the ""courtesy invite."" Your childhood neighbor you haven't seen in 15 years would love to have you there, but sometimes you have to say no. Be polite and send a thoughtful gift, but don't waste your frequent flier miles on a wedding for someone whose middle name you don't know. Shack up and double up . Part of the fun of traveling to weddings is that they're usually a reunion with old friends -- and therefore present excellent opportunities to cut costs. ""Going in with your friends for a group gift is a great way to buy something more substantial for the couple,"" Winikka suggests. Winikka advises finding out ahead of time who is going to the wedding so you can make plans to share a hotel room or at least share transportation costs from the airport. Parading down the aisle dressed isn't exactly the same as strolling down a white, sandy beach, but if weddings are eating up your money and your vacation time at work, turn it into a vacation by tacking a couple of days on to the beginning or end of the trip. Last summer, when my friend Elizabeth got married in Northern California, I scheduled a visit with another friend in Southern California and then drove up the Pacific Coast Highway. Think outside the gift box . One of the best things about getting married is the loot you receive. But when it comes to presents, most of the brides I talked to said they'd prefer their loved ones' presence at their nuptials to a fancy gift. Thanks to Pinterest and DIY blogs, homemade gift ideas are easy to find and replicate.  Some of my favorites include homemade soaps, a scrapbook of unprofessional pictures from the wedding and collections of recipes from friends and family. If Pinterest makes you feel as inadequate as I do, offer to house-sit or dog-sit while the couple is on their honeymoon or stock their fridge with a homemade dinner for when they return. Just because it's not on their registry doesn't mean it won't be appreciated. Recycle that dress . You were waiting for this one, weren't you? It's a myth, ladies.  Despite many a bride promising her maids ""You can wear it again,"" I've actually never been able to pull this off. Count the dress as a loss, a memory of a good time and the start to your very own ""27 Dresses"" collection. Though I've never regretted any of the money I spent helping get my friends down the aisle to say ""I do,"" with a little more forethought, planning and creativity, I could have Chicken Danced a lot easier without cracking open my nest egg.
