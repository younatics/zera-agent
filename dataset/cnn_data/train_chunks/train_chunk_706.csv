Her views shot to prominence in October when she first appeared in front of an audience of millions on Arabs Got Talent, where she eventually made it to the semi-finals. Interest in her music quickly grew and new fans have been posting up to 50 supportive messages on Facebook every day. But she said it has also provoked a backlash among radicals. She told the Guardian: 'Some say I'm creating a bad name for Islam. Or even that I'm an infidel.

Ollie Middleton, aged 18, has been selected as Labour's candidate for the 2015 general election in Bath . The Labour party has selected an 18-year-old to stand for Parliament. Ollie Middleton, who was born just two years before Tony Blair’s New Labour landslide, is to contest the Bath seat in 2015. But the university student will have a fight on his hands, trying to overturn a Lib Dem majority of almost 12,000. Anyone can stand for election once they turn 18, and Mr Middleton will be 20 by the time voters in Bath go to the polls. But Mr Middleton is young enough to be the grandson of current Bath MP Don Foster. It is not clear if Mr Foster, who first won the seat for the Lib Dems since 1992, will stand for re-election in 2015. Labour party insiders say they were initially surprised at Mr Middleton’s selection, but he impressed activists with an impassioned speech. Mr Middleton, a student at Westminster University, said: ‘I am absolutely thrilled to have been given the chance to represent Labour in my home city.  I’ve enjoyed the selection process which has been robust and competitive. ‘However, the real work starts now. The Bath Labour Party is campaigning on issues that affect the people of Bath including the proposed closure of Children’s centres and it offers a real and positive alternative to the Lib Dem policies' Labour party managers said they thought the idea of selecting an 18-year-old could have been 'mad' but insist Mr Middleton impressed the selection meeting . Mr Middleton added: 'Our campaigning work will continue to . engage directly with local people. I will listen to the people of Bath . and fight for the issues that matter to them.’ Bath was Tory-held for almost 70 years, until Mr Foster dramatically defeated then-Tory chairman Chris Patten in 1992. At . the last election in 2010, Mr Foster took 57 per cent of the vote for . the Lib Dems, with the Tories on 31 per cent and Labour trailing on just . 7 per cent – half what it achieved in 2005. At the 2010 general election, Labour polled just 7 per cent of the vote, well behind the Tories and Lib Dems . Diana Page, who oversaw Labour’s selection process, told MailOnline that Mr Middleton had impressed party activists at the weekend’s selection meeting, beating off competition from older, more experienced candidates. ‘Ollie gave a speech that was just so professional and came across as way beyond his years and he won the first ballot. ‘He was very impressive because normally we would look at it and think the party had gone made to select an 18-year-old.’ Babies of the House: Former holders of the title of youngest MP include (left to right) Charles Kennedy, Jo Swinson and Tony Benn . The youngest MP in the Commons is known as the ‘Baby of the House’. The current holder of the title is Pamela Nash, Labour MP for Airdrie and Shotts, who was born on 24 June 1984 and was just 25 when elected. Before her, Tory MP Chloe Smith was the youngest MP, having taken the Norwich North seat in a by-election in 2009. She went on to be a Treasury and Cabinet Office minister before quitting at the last reshuffle. Pamela Nash, Labour MP for Airdrie and Shotts, is the current Baby of the House . Other former Babies of the House to rise . to prominence include Lib Dem Business Minister Jo Swinson (25 when . elected), former Lib Dem minister Sarah Teather (29), ex-Lib Dem leader . Charles Kennedy (23), former Labour minister David Lammy (27) and former . Tory Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell (27). Ex-Liberal party leader David Steel was youngest MP when elected in 196. Ex-Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn was first elected in 1950 aged 25 while disgraced Tory Cabinet minister John Profumo was only 25 when elected in 1944. The youngest MP on record was James Dickson, elected as Liberal MP for Dungannon in April 1859, aged 21 years and 67 days. In 2006 the law was changed so that the minimum age for an election candidate was lowered from 21 to 18. However, the average age of the Commons is still 50, a year younger than in 2005 but older than the general elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987. Labour MPs are, on average, four years older than Conservatives, and two years older than Liberal Democrats.","University student selected to stand for Parliament in 2015 .

Tragedy: Popular teacher Frances Cappuccini died after giving birth to her second son Jack . A primary school teacher died after she was reluctantly persuaded to change her birth plan, a coroner's court heard. Frances Cappuccini, 30, described as being 'hugely popular' among her pupils, died a few hours after giving birth to her son Jack by emergency Caesarean on October 9 last year. Jack, who weighed 7lb 15oz when he was born, was given the middle name Frankie in memory of his mother. At a pre-inquest review hearing this . week, barrister Neil Sheldon, representing the family, said Mrs Cappuccini's death may have been avoided if her birth plan had been followed at . Tunbridge Wells Hospital in Pembury, Kent. Mr . Sheldon told West Kent Coroner's Court that Frances - known as Frankie - and . her husband Tom, 33, had elected for her to have a Caesarean section, . but the couple were 'reluctantly' persuaded to discard their birth plan . to allow labour to progress spontaneously overnight. Mrs Cappuccini eventually needed an emergency Caesarean and suffered heavy bleeding afterwards. Although she found the strength to . spend a few hours nursing her son, Jack, she died of a cardiac arrest soon after. Her husband is now bringing up Jack and the couple's other son Luca, four. Mrs Cappuccini, who was affectionately called 'Mrs Coffee' by her pupils, was a Year One teacher at Offham Primary School, near West Malling, Kent. At . the time of the tragedy, staff were said to be 'shell shocked' and . decided to close the small 200-pupil village school for a day to help . children come to terms with her death. Mr . Sheldon said it was 'unlikely' an elective Caesarean carried out on the evening of October 8 would have been complicated. He added that the family 'deeply regretted' adopting a different course of action to the birth plan and spoke of the profound concern displayed by the family in witness statements given in the days following their tragic loss. Mr Sheldon said there may be an issue concerning the extent to which parental preference for the mode of delivery could be overridden by obstetric staff at the hospital. Mrs Cappuccini, who was affectionately called 'Mrs Coffee' by her pupils, was a Year One teacher at Offham Primary School, near West Malling, Kent . A book of condolence was opened  and devastated pupils left personal messages . He suggested this could be an issue which would require further investigation. He said other issues would be . explored further by him at the full inquest, set for next February, . including why a blood transfusion was not carried out sooner on Mrs Cappuccini. Mr . Sheldon said liability had already been admitted by the Maidstone and . Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust and there would be a civil claim for damages. The inquest into Mrs Cappuccini's death will take place in February . A statement released by solicitor Kate Rohde read: 'The Cappuccini family are relieved that the inquisitorial process has begun because it will give them the opportunity to understand how and why. The inquest is set to take place between February 24-28 next year. After Mrs Cappuccini's death last year, her school's headteacher Phillip Hunter said: 'Frankie did her teacher training with us nine years ago and stayed on afterwards. 'She was a bubbly, enthusiastic and positive person and on top of all a brilliant teacher. She was a friend and a colleague to us.' A book of condolence was opened at nearby St Michael's Church and tearful villagers left flowers and personal messages. Shortly after her death, Paula Botha, whose son Troy was taught by Frankie, said: 'It is such a tragedy for this to happen, and to such a wonderful person just makes it feel so much more of a tragedy. 'She was an amazing teacher and an amazing individual and we are all going to miss her very much - her family, the school children, fellow teachers, parents and friends.

George Osborne has distanced himself from Boris Johnson’s controversial comments that suggested some people had too low an IQ to ever get to the top. The Chancellor said he ‘did not agree with everything’ the London mayor said and that everyone should be given the best chance in life. Both Mr Osborne and Mr Johnson are seen as future Conservative leadership contenders once David Cameron throws in the towel. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured left, has said he does not agree with the comments made by Boris Johnson, pictured right, that tackling economic inequality is 'futile' because some people aren't bright enough to compete in the modern world . Last week the Eton-educated mayor of London sparked outrage when he said tackling economic inequality was ‘futile’ because some people were simply not born bright enough to compete in the modern world. The Chancellor said he agreed that equality of outcome was not achievable, but said he disagreed with the way Mr Johnson had presented his argument. ‘I wouldn’t have put it like that,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘I don’t agree with everything he said. ‘I think there is an increasing consensus across the political spectrum that you can’t achieve equality of outcome but you should be able to achieve equality of opportunity. ‘You should give everyone, wherever they come from, the best chance. Education is, I think, the best key to this.’ Tribute: Mr Johnson made the comments at the third annual Margaret Thatcher Lecture - staged by the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies think-tank . Delivering the annual Margaret Thatcher Lecture last week, Mr Johnson said globalisation was intensifying the trend towards inequality. ‘I am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in terms of raw ability, if not spiritual worth,’ he said. ‘Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130. ‘The harder you shake the pack, the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top.’ He said the income gap between the richest and the poorest was getting wider than ever because of the ‘God-given talent’ of those in boardrooms. ‘I don’t believe that economic equality is possible,’ he added. ‘Indeed, some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that  is, like greed, a valuable spur to  economic activity.’ The Mayor of London, along with Prime Minister David Cameron, was educated at Eton College, Berkshire .","The Mayor of London has claimed tackling economic inequality is 'futile'

RBS is set to reward its bankers with bonuses of £500million this year, despite plunging losses at the taxpayer-backed lender. The bank has been embroiled in a string of humiliating scandals, from rigging market rates and mis-selling to accusations it crippled small businesses. But the group is poised to award a vast bonus pool to its staff yet again. The Royal Bank of Scotland is due to hand out £500million in bonuses to staff despite losses, fines for involvement in the Libor rate fixing scandal and mis-selling of PPI and fresh allegations of crippling small businesses . The shocking revelation comes just days after extraordinary figures showed that City bankers saw their pay rise by more than a third last year. The top 2,700 enjoyed an average pay packet of £1.6million - in stark contrast to millions of families struggling to make ends meet. Despite claims that the bonus culture has been cooled in the wake of the financial crash, British bankers are now the highest paid in Europe. Critics said this showed a return of ‘Gordon Gekko’-style greed. RBS, which had a bonus pool of £900million last year, has been forced to shell out hundreds of millions of pounds in fines over a number of misdemeanours. The group was fined £390million in the wake of the market manipulation scandal, where traders rigged the £180 trillion Libor rate. It has also set aside £2.6billion to compensate millions who were mis-sold PPI insurance. This year it is expected to report deep financial losses. Deborah Hargreaves, from the High Pay Centre, said: ‘Because it is a state owned bank you would like to see it setting an example. ‘RBS says that if it didn’t pay bonuses its top traders would leave. We should call their bluff. Are the type of people we want those who are motivated purely by money?’ She added: ‘Most people would struggle to understand when you are being paid a very sizable salary why you need that bonus anyway.’ The bank was bailed out by £45million during the collapse and is still 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer . The bank has been forced to call in lawyers Clifford Chance after admitting some of its lending practices had driven small firms to the wall. The group was accused of putting companies into bankruptcy before buying up their property. Fresh accusations yesterday said that the bank pushed companies into administration by demanding repayments of loans at difficult times. In several instances, the bank was said to have demanded money back earmarked for tax payments. RBS was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 for £45billion, and is still 82per cent owned by the government. Chief executive Stephen Hester was parachuted in to run the bank, but quit earlier this year after a tenure that saw him forced to give up his bonus several times. Government plans to sell shares back to the markets, thus reimbursing the taxpayer, have hit a snag. Plans were delayed by a debate over whether the group should be split into a ‘good bank’ and a ‘bad bank’, holding toxic assets. A spokesman for the bank said: ‘No decisions have been taken on 2013 pay and any speculation is premature. ‘Variable pay has been reformed dramatically at RBS and is now a fraction of what it was before the crisis.’","Royal Bank of Scotland expected to post huge losses this year .

Drones could soon be delivering everything from post to drugs using a vast international network, a U.S. firm has claimed. Matternet, a Silicon Valley startup, has already trialled the drone network in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where they were able to fly for six miles carrying a 2kg payload. The firm now hopes to expand with an ambitious plan to replace existing delivery systems and set up a global network of 'drone routes' for the gadgets, which can automatically fly themselves. Scroll down for video . You've got drone-mail: The U.S. startup hopes to initially use the network to deliver drugs and other supplies to third world countries . The matternet drones are entirely automated, and will be backed up by a network of 'hubs' on the ground rather like post offices. These hubs would let the drones pick up and drop of packages, and also recharge their batteries before continuing to the next . station. Control of the drones and the assignment of packages for delivery . would eventually be handled by an automated operating system, Matternet says, and orders or . requests could  be placed and paid for by mobile phone. The firm hopes to set up recharging base stations for the drones so they can stop and recharge themselves along the way. Currently the firm has drones that can travel six miles and carry 2kg, but has plans for larger drones with a longer range. The firm hopes the system will be used initially in rural areas or countries where there is no established road network.

Mr Brown's post about the incident spread across social media with viral force and resulted in condemnations of the restaurant and the staff. An employee contacted Radio Facts, a broadcast industry blog, and said it was actually the customers who were being racist.

A Welsh politician has picked a fight with Oxford University by asking for the return of one of Wales' oldest treasures. The university is currently the custodian of a 33,000-year-old skeleton that received the oldest ceremonial burial in Western Europe. But Byron Davies, the Assembly Member for South Wales, has asked the university to return the remains of the person known as the Red Lady of Paviland, who was buried in Gower, Wales. The 'Red Lady of Paviland' was discovered in a limestone cave in Gower in 1823 by a geology professor at the Oxford University, where it is kept. Here, Museum Assistant Lisa Roberts is pictured with the remains when they were on show at the National Museum and Galleries of Wales in Cardiff . The skeleton, which is actually that of a man, got its name as it was dyed in red ochre, giving its bones the unusual colour. It was discovered in a limestone cave in Gower in 1823 by a geology professor at the university, which is why the skeleton has been under lock and key in Oxford ever since. It is still the oldest ceremonial burial of a human discovered in Western Europe. Oxford University said the skeleton is one of the iconic relics of the British Palaeolithic, and a cast of the skeleton is on permanent display, along with related artefacts, at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The bones were thought to be a woman's because of jewellery found nearby and were wrongly dated to Roman times by the professor when they were found (reconstruction of Paviland burial pictured) Welsh politician Byron Davies wants the skeleton to be returned to Wales, where it was found. The skeleton was unearthed in Gower, south Wales . The bones were thought to be a woman's because of jewellery found nearby and were wrongly dated to Roman times by the professor when they were found. Mr Davies believes the skeleton ‘belongs to Gower’ and said: ‘It would be good to have it back where it belongs. It adds to the bigger picture of bringing people to the city and to the Gower.’ ‘I understand the University of Oxford is not in favour of releasing it, so there would have to be some negotiation.’ The skeleton was found during at Goat's Hole Cave - one of the limestone caves between Port Eynon and Rhossili, on the Gower Peninsula, south Wales . Mr Davies believes the skeleton should be on display. ‘But the university has it at the moment and it is not on display with them, which I think is wrong,’ he said. The skeleton got its name as it was dyed in red ochre, giving its bones the unusual colour . He is ‘serious’ about raising funds to . ensure the remains could be kept safe in Swansea, close to where they . found and the Red Lady of Peviland was laid to rest. Mr Davies said: ‘I have yet to take the next step which would be to make some sort of contact with the university, to talk to them nicely about it and try to be reasonable. ‘They did lend the original bones to the Museum of Wales in, I think, 2009,’ he added. The politician said Swansea Museum if keen to look after the Red Lady, but noted that the outcome is ‘up to the university’. ‘I have a fairly persuasive tongue in me. I hope I've a chance,’ he said. This week, UK Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who was brought up in Bridgend, spoke with Mr Davies about getting the bones back. ‘When she came down she was quite fascinated by the story and agreed it should be on display in Swansea,’ Mr Davies said. However, a spokesman from Oxford University said the skeleton is ‘held securely in a collections room inside the museum and is available for researchers and guided tours’.’ ‘Neither the Museum nor the University of Oxford has been formally approached with a request to discuss repatriation of the ‘Red Lady’ material, so the question of whether the ‘Red Lady’ should be repatriated to a permanent home in Wales is not currently under consideration.' 'The University of Oxford does have a policy on repatriation and any decision would be made by the University’s Council (its governing body) following advice received from those responsible for the collection of which this item is a part,' he said. A cast is on display in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and in 2014 the bones will go on display at London's Natural History Museum.","The Red Lady of Paviland is actually the skeleton of a man and got its name as it was dyed in red ochre, giving its bones the unusual colour .

Children from poor backgrounds and one-parent families are more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a new study has revealed. Researchers found a link between social and economic status and childhood ADHD in Britain. A team led by the University of Exeter Medical School analysed data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a database of more than 19,500 British children born between 2000 and 2002. Children from poor backgrounds and one-parent families are more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a new study has revealed . The study, published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, showed that there was a greater prevalence of ADHD among children from families living below the poverty line. The researchers found the average family income for a household with a child affected by ADHD was £324 per week, compared to £391 for those with unaffected children. The study also found the chance of parents in social housing having a child with ADHD was roughly three times greater than for those who owned their own homes. The researchers also discovered that the odds of younger mothers having a child with ADHD were significantly higher than for older mothers. Mothers with no qualifications were more than twice as likely to have a child with ADHD as those with degrees, and lone parents were more likely to have a child with ADHD than households with two live-in parents. Information was gathered from surveys when the children were nine months old, and at the ages of three, five, seven and 11. The researchers also discovered that the odds of younger mothers having a child with ADHD were significantly higher than for older mothers . Study leader Dr Ginny Russell, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ‘There is a genetic element to ADHD, but this study provides strong evidence that ADHD is also associated with a disadvantaged social and economic background. ‘Some people believe that ADHD in children causes disadvantage to the economic situation of their family, but we found no evidence to support that theory. ‘It's important to discover more about the causes of this disorder so that we can look towards prevention, and so that we can target treatment and support effectively.’","The average family income for a .

A new robot that can fly and mimic the movements of a beachside nuisance was presented to the world on Sunday. At the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Pittsburgh, designers Leif Ristroph and Stephen Childress showed off the stunning creation, Science Codex reports. Both Ristroph and Childress are part of New York University's Courant Institute, according to a press release for their presentation 'Hovering of a jellyfish-like flying machine.' The robot, seen here, weighs a mere 2g and is 4in across . The robot's wings 'squirt,' allowing it to move as if it were a flying jellyfish . Ristroph, Science Codex reports, said the main challenge of imitating flapping wings is that they are 'inherently unstable.' He cited fruit flies, noting that they constantly tweak their motions in response to the elements. Amazingly, the tiny robot weighs a mere 2g and is 4 inches across, Discovery reports. Though it is not autonomous, Ristroph plans to build more robots that are able to fly entirely on their own. The robot's wings 'squirt air' and give it momentum to lift off, allowing it to move like the jelly, NBC News reports. The wings are connected to a power source via a wire to allow for movement. Ristroph said that his robot designs were 'sort of dumb' -- they stay afloat solely by using their wings. 'That's the beauty of the design,' told NBC News. 'It doesn't need a 'smart' design to help it recover.'

A Martian meteorite dug up by Bedouin tribesmen in the Sahara dates back almost 4.5 billion years and could contain the secret to the red planet once harbouring life. The rock is believed to be the oldest recognised sample of soil from Mars and holds a wealth of information about its origin and age. It also provides clues about the release of volatiles - chemicals linked to a planet's water - with evidence about the first 100 million years of the planet's existence. A meteorite from Northwest Africa called NWA 7533 may be the first recognized example of ancient Martian crust, according to data presented in Nature this week . Using spectrometers - which can identify thousands of different chemicals - scientists discovered high concentrations of trace metals such as iridium which showed the sample is the first to come from Mars' southern highlands. The meteorite called NWA 7533 after its landing spot of North West Africa was part of a celestial rock that broke up on entering Earth's atmosphere producing at least five recovered stones. Another sample - known as 7034 and nicknamed 'Black Beauty' - was dated earlier this year at 2.1 billion years old but the new age of 4.4 billion years is based on minerals called zircons providing evidence of an early differentiation of the Martian crust in the first 100 million years of its history. Professor Munir Humayun said: 'The early magmatic build-up of the Martian highland crust requires an equally rapid release of volatiles from the Martian interior - forming the early atmosphere and hydrosphere (water found on, under and over the surface) - with implications for early Martian climate and biological potential.' The fist-sized meteorite nicknamed Black Beauty, could unlock vital clues to the evolution of Mars from the warm and wet place it once was to its current cold and dry state . Like Earth the red planet is 'differentiated' in it has a central core of metallic iron and nickel surrounded by a less dense, silicate mantle and crust. Its distinctive colour is due to the oxidation of iron on its surface. It might not just be men who are from Mars - a recent study suggests that all life on Earth began on the red planet too. An element believed to be crucial to the origin of life would only have been available on the surface of Mars, it is claimed. Geochemist Professor Steven Benner has argued that the 'seeds' of life probably arrived on Earth in meteorites blasted off Mars by impacts or volcanic eruptions. As evidence, he points to the oxidised mineral form of the element molybdenum, thought to be a catalyst that helped organic molecules develop into the first living structures. ‘In addition, recent studies show that these conditions, suitable for the origin of life, may still exist on Mars,’ said Professor Benner, of the Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology in Gainesville, Florida. ‘It’s only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidised that it is able to influence how early life formed. ‘This form of molybdenum couldn’t have been available on Earth at the time life first began, because three billion years ago the surface of the Earth had very little oxygen, but Mars did. ‘It’s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to Earth on a Martian meteorite, rather than starting on this planet.’ The zircons in the meteorite were probably formed by re-melting of the original Martian crust, says Professor Munir Humayan. Their similarity with the earliest terrestrial and lunar zircons suggests Mars' crust form at the same time as Earth and Moon. Professor Humayan, if Florida State University, said: 'This cratered terrain has been long thought to hold the keys to Mars' birth and early childhood. 'This date is about 100 million years after the first dust condensed in the solar system. 'We now know Mars had a crust within the first 100 million years of the start of planet building and its crust formed concurrently with the oldest crusts on Earth and the Moon.' The researchers, who findings are published in the journal Nature, were also able to calculate the thickness of the planet's crust and say their trailblazing discoveries are just the tip of the iceberg. Further studies could reveal more clues about the impact history of Mars, the nature of Martian zircons and the make-up of the earliest sediments on the Red Planet. Leading meteorite expert Prof Harry McSween, of Tennessee University, who reviewed the study, said: 'The real surprise is the ancient age reported for NWA 7533 - 4.4 billion years - demonstrating it is a sample of the earliest Martian crust."" Many of the Martian meteorites that exist today have been found in the Sahara by Bedouin tribesmen who know the rocks can fetch a pretty price in the marketplace of Casablanca. And that's where the five stones eventually surfaced. Three were bought by a wealthy American collector while at least one was bought by a Frenchman who suspected it was somehow different and sent it to Prof Humayan via a museum in Paris. Since its discovery Black Beauty's value has jumped from $50 a gram to $15,000 a gram - and now could soar .","Rock is believed to be the oldest .

Mr Cameron faced accusations of . cronyism after flying to Beijing yesterday at the head of the trade . mission which features his father-in-law, a neighbour and a major Tory . donor as well as a string of eyebrow-raising names. Downing Street protested to China's Communist rulers after a journalist was barred from entering the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. US news agency Bloomberg was told it was not welcome - apparently because it had covered the financial affairs of China's president and his family. Robert Hutton, the agency's London-based reporter travelling with the Prime Minister, was forced to wait outside while others were ushered in to hear president Xi Jinping and David Cameron speak about their talks. A Number 10 spokesman said: 'As soon as this issue became apparent on Sunday, we raised our concerns at senior levels and made clear it would be completely inappropriate to exclude journalists from the press statements. 'When we heard what had happened today we expressed our deep concern to senior Chinese officials about journalists being blocked.' A number have a close personal link to him – including his wife Samantha’s stepfather Viscount Astor. But . also on the plane were Sir Peter Bazalgette, who brought Big Brother . into UK living rooms, and Miss Brady, vice-chairman of West Ham . United. Downing Street today denied it was a 'crony trip'. A spokesman said: 'The delegation list is drawn together by UKTI. It is determined on the basis of the very best business opportunities. It is all about getting the very best business opportunities for the UK,” the spokesman said. The spokesman said that all the business delegates were required to pay their own way on the trip. Mr Cameron today vowed to tear down the ‘bamboo curtain’ of trade barriers which stops China from investing in Britain. The . Prime Minister used the start of a trade visit in Beijing to warn the .

Mr Cameron has opened an account on Sina Weibo account, China's version of Twitter, to promote his trip . The Premier characterised the talks as ‘highly productive’ and said that Britain and China had become ‘indispensible partners for each other’s development.’ ‘I believe our meeting will usher China/UK relationship onto a new stage,’ said Mr Li. ‘We need to grow this relationship at a higher speed. We can take this relationship to a higher stage at a faster pace.’ Mr Cameron’s painstakingly-constructed schedule for the three-day visit had to be torn up at the last minute, after the Chinese invited him to separate lavish meals with President Xi and Premier Li on the same day. Downing Street portrayed the invitations as an indication of the value which Beijing places on close relations with the UK and Mr Cameron declared himself ‘delighted’ to secure lengthy discussions with the two men who are expected to lead China through the coming decade. The changes meant dropping a visit to Hangzhou, but Mr Cameron will still travel to China’s international financial hub Shanghai and the inland city of Chengdu in Sichuan province, a global centre for consumer electronics. Plans for the visit were delayed by many months by China’s frosty response to Mr Cameron’s meeting with the Dalai Lama in London last year, and Beijing issued its invitation only after Downing Street made clear he had no plans to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader again.

Plans to dump 12million tonnes of rock and soil in the Chilterns to make way for HS2 have caused outrage among conservationists. Protestors claim plans to redistribute surplus material in the area of outstanding natural beauty in the south east of England, will 'desecrate' the area of 'precious natural heritage'. Those in charge of the project say their proposals are an environmentally friendly way to dispose of the materials - and that the soil will be landscaped appropriately. 'Area of beauty': Plans to dump tonnes of soil and rock in the Chilterns, pictured, have infuriated conservationists . The Chilterns Conservation Board say a 35-hectare plateau near the village of South Heath, among other places, will be destroyed. Steve Rodrick, the board's chief officer, said: 'An . HS2 engineer told a public meeting that ""it will be landscaped and look . very nice."" 'Words fail . me when I think that our precious national heritage is going to be . desecrated by people with so little feeling for what is special and . unique.' 'This is a cheapskate design with cheapskate solutions,' reported The Observer. The plans were revealed in a 55,000-page draft HS2 Hybrid Bill submitted to Parliament last week by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. Link: The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033 . It says the HS2 project will require demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities and destroy two areas of sites of special scientific interest (SSSI). It also says HS2 will require 2,500hectars of high-quality and 2,300hectrares of poorer quality agricultural land and will directly affect 18 Grade II listed buildings. Some 67 dwellings will be ‘significantly affected by noise from the operation of the railway,’ it adds. Additionally, the Woodland Trust say 21 ancient woods will be destroyed. The bill states that of the 12million . tonnes of excavated material, 10,000 will be put into landfill. The rest . will be taken to the Chilterns. Fury: Campaigners - given just 60 days to read the consultation report on HS2 - protest outside Parliament on last Monday . By keeping material in the area, managers . say they can avoid the costly - and environmentally damaging - process . of taking the material away by lorry. An HS2 spokesman said: 'HS2 will . be built in the grain of the countryside and aims to reuse up to 91% of . the material generated from building the line. There are: . 'By . creating landscaped earthworks and shaping soils along the track side . to help capture the sound of trains, designers are both insulating the . effects of the railway and dramatically cutting the amount of material . that would have to be otherwise transported from the line by road.' Work on HS2 is due to start in Spring and should be completed by 2026. Speaking to a board of MP watchdogs shortly after he submitted the bill, Mr . McLoughlin said he was ‘completely satisfied‘ the £50billion line from . London to Birmingham was the only way to stop gridlock on Britain's . rails. The estimated cost of the full HS2 scheme - comprising phase one and phase two north of Birmingham - is £42.6 billion plus £7.5 billion for the trains. Mr McLoughlin said he was confident the estimated £21.6billion figure for phase one could be reduced to £17.16 billion. Lawyers for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) have threatened legal action against the Government after only 60 days over Christmas and New Year holidays were given to read the 50,000 page document.

But through her love of music - and with little help from her friends - Kaitlin Windt is determined not to let her progressively debilitating illness stop her playing in her beloved marching band. The 14-year-old flute player, who goes to Boardman High School in Ohio, has a dreadful birth gene that was eventually diagnosed as Friedreich's Ataxia. It's muscular dystrophy, scoliosis, heart weakness, circulation problems, diabetes and more rolled into one tragic syndrome. Brave: Wheelchair-bound flute player Kaitlin Windt (centre) takes part in a performance with her high school marching band despite suffering a crippling illness that causes heart problems and her muscles to seize up . Helping hands: Kaitlin is pushed around by the band director's daughter Rachael Ruggieri who has learned the entire routine to ensure everything goes smoothly during the performance . When she reached high school this year, Kaitlin and her band director Tom Ruggieri vowed not to let Friedreich's stop her from joining the band. With the rapid and intricate movements of a high school marching band - from twisting tubas to dipping drums to majorettes - it's no place for a wheelchair to be rolling around. But for Ruggieri, Kaitlin's spot in the 184-member band started long before he ever met her. Several years ago, he watched a news program about a college marching band. In it, was a wheelchair-bound student whose father learned the march routine so he could push his son on the field. 'I choked up when I saw it,' said Ruggieri. 'I put myself in that position and wondered ""How would I do it?"" 'I thought: I would like to make that happen some day.' Against the odds: The 14-year-old has Friedreich's Ataxia which causes muscular dystrophy, scoliosis, heart weakness and diabetes, but is determined to continue doing the things she loves . having fun: Kaitlin Windt (right) with fellow band member Helen Nguyen during a football game in Boardman, Ohio . That 'some day' came last spring. Kaitlin has been in a school band since fifth grade and she had dreams of being in the Boardman High band. Walking has always been a challenge with her disease, but halfway through eighth grade last year, the curvature in her spine had progressed that she needed rods inserted in her back to straighten her. It made her walking even more unstable and a wheelchair safer. Kaitlin's father, Howard, said: 'Mr Ruggieri already knew of Kaitlin and her interest in band. He got a surprise with the wheelchair, though.' Kaitlin's mother, Chrissy Longley, did not want Kaitlin's feelings hurt. 'She really wanted to be part of band, but I didn't want to get her hopes up,' Chrissy said. 'The last thing I wanted to do was have her sign up and learn that she had to sit on sidelines.' Ruggieri didn't want that either. 'We have the same expectations for all our kids,' Ruggieri said. 'Never are all kids at the same level of music or marching. We work with all of them.' For Kaitlin to play her flute in the Boardman band, an adult would need to learn all the drills and push Kaitlin around the field at every event. Howard's and Chrissy's work schedules would not permit them. Ruggieri needed someone to volunteer - but he got two. Beth Bean, band booster club president and mother to band members Jeff, a senior, and Kristine, a freshman, said: 'It brought back memories of my band life at Springfield,' This summer, she added the role of Kaitlin's away game partner. Kaitlin's home games were handled by Ruggieri's daughter, Rachel, who came home from Kent State to help out. It was an easy fit for Beth and Rachel as they were set to be at the critical band camp anyway to assist Ruggieri. The three of them got started together at August camp in Erie, Pa., and Mother Nature tested them from the start. Progressive illness: Kaitlin (pictured with school friends) developed a curvature in her spine halfway through eighth grade last year which meant she needed rods inserted in her back to straighten her . Rain-soaked fields, mud, slogging - it was a tough introduction to their new partnership. 'We started with the worst conditions, so it could only get better,' Rachel said. Kaitlin laughs at those first days. 'I almost fell out of my chair twice,' said the 14-year-old who, with her brother Blake, 12, splits living time between her parents' Boardman homes. Beth recalls one tipping moment. 'I turned too fast and was not used to the chair yet and I hear ""Mrs Bean - I'm tipping"",' Beth said with a laugh. Both Beth and Rachel said if you think their job was tough, try being Kaitlin and playing the flute while all this was going on. Friend Rachel Ruggieri . 'She did the best to play flute while we bumped around,' said Rachel. 'It was just nice to see her happy and enjoying the band.' Already solved for the Boardman band next year is who will handle Kaitlin. Beth and Rachel are already set to go. And Kaitlin no doubt expects to be there. Kaitlin had a normal kid life - doing ballet and playing baseball. He parents later noticed small things, but they were dismissible. Friedreich's itself is often not diagnosed until teen years or later, said Chrissy. That all changed in the summer before fifth grade as the disease took control. 'It affects everyone differently,' said Howard. The impact of the diagnosis came to the family in stages. 'First they told us the ataxia part -- a tightening of the muscles, and I thought, 'oh well, no biggie - therapy and stretching,' said Chrissy. 'Friedreich's is a whole different ball game.' Of all the harsh realities of Friedreich's, one reality strikes just a bit harder - it is genetic. Kaitlin's brother Blake has it as well. 'I was in Columbus for work,' said Chrissy when she got the news. She and Howard ended their marriage long before Friedreich's entered their lives. 'I was away from the kids, so they could not see me break down. It was so hard to grasp. I did not function for days.' Kaitlin talks with Boardman High School band director Tom Ruggieri who was inspired to help her after hearing about a wheelchair-bound student whose father learned the march routine so he could push his son . Chrissy struggled with guilt. 'It's a horrible feeling knowing it's a genetic disease. As a parent - I know that it came from me,' she said. Although it affects 1 in 50,000 Americans, how it happens seems almost a tragic fluke. The gene can exist and be defective in any one person and there are no problems. That's Howard and Chrissy. When those two people who have that defective gene have children, there's a 25 per cent chance their offspring will have the disease. That's Kaitlin and Blake. Friedreich's Ataxia is a genetic condition that around 1 in 50,000 people in the United States. The illness affects everyone differently, but symptoms range from loss of co-ordination in the arms and legs, fatigue, muscle loss and heart disease. It can also cause aggressive scoliosis - a curvature of the spine - and diabetes. The defective gene can exist in any one person and there are no problems. But when two people who have that defective gene have children, there's a 25 per cent chance their offspring will have the disease. There is currently no cure, but some of the symptoms can be managed. Blake's determined that he won't be in a wheelchair, said Howard. And they notice that physical effects on him are less than Katlin's. But Blake required glasses at an earlier age - the disease affected his eye muscles. Around Kaitlin is a core of friends who've she's known since kindergarten: Courtney Segool, Shannon McMaster and Emily Mook. They form a tight ring around her - aiding with all her needs as needed at the dorm, on the bus and more. 'Her friends are so welcoming to her. They're the most loving people,' Rachel said. And occasionally in life, you bump into new folks like Ruggieri, Rachel and Beth, willing to figure out new things. 'I was floored at how much they've invested in her,' said Chrissy, who was watching video posts throughout the week of band camp. 'This was a huge deal for Kaitlin.' Rachel was nervous, she admits. She asked her father what if this doesn't work. 'He said ""We're just going to make it work"",' she said. 'I love that he's not afraid to take risks that others would push away.' Ruggieri said being in band is about adjustments and acceptance, and this was just the same - even though that TV segment was his only evidence of seeing it work in his 25 years. 'None of us looked at it as ""It's a great thing we're doing."" 'It was simply: This is what the band needs - let's do it.'","Kaitin Windt has rare genetic condition called Freidrich's Ataxia .

Thirty people were injured this morning when an icy bridge caused a massive pile-up of 70 cars, two tractor-trailers and one box trailer in Worcester, Massachusetts. There were no fatalities and none of the injuries were serious, but the 6:45am accident did cause traffic to stop for hours in both directions on route 1-290. Route 1-290 eastbound wasn't reopened until 10am, followed by the westbound reopening just before noon. As soon as we hit the bridge, I mean we came over the top and it was a sheet of ice,' driver Jill Conway told NECN. 'We saw cars every which way and tried to slow down and realized it was just total ice. I chose to go into the divider to slow down, and, you know, there was nothing I could do.'

Trapped: Some of the cars involved in the crash were pushed underneath a tractor-trailer, shown above . Freezing temperatures over night caused the bridge where the crash happened to freeze over. Bridges freeze faster than roads for two reasons. One is that they are exposed on all sides to the weather, which allows heat to escape faster. Also, most bridges are made of steel and concrete which conducts heat more than asphalt making temperatures variable. Those injured in the crash were bussed off the highway and taken to the hospital, while some lucky enough to drive off in their own cars recalled the scary situation. One driver says it was a 'miracle' that her family didn't get hit. Inventory: About 25 crashed cars were taken off the road and cataloged by police at a local lot . Caution: The accident happened on a bridge in Worcester.

Mother with private healthcare plans are twice as likely to have a pre-planned c-section than those who give birth using an NHS hospital . Well-off mothers really are 'too posh to push', according to new figures which show pregnant women who have private healthcare plans are twice as likely to have a pre-planned Caesarean section. A study has found that 21 per cent of private patients have a scheduled C-section compared to just 8.9 per cent of publicly funded ones. Researchers examined 30,000 women who gave birth at a hospital in Ireland which caters for both private and public-funded patients between 2008 and 2011. Around one in five of the women paid for their treatment themselves. The research, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that, overall, 34.4 per cent of privately paying mothers had a C-section, compared to 22.5 per cent of public patients. The 'greatest disparity' noted between the mothers was the rates of scheduled C-sections, the study found. For first-time mothers, 11.9 per cent of private patients had pre-planned surgery compared to just 4.6 per cent of those whose care was paid for by the public purse. 'We found that private patients are more likely than public patients to have an operative vaginal delivery or a Caesarean section.' The difference was particularly great among women who had given birth . before by C-section, while private patients were also more likely to . have a surgical vaginal delivery using a vacuum or forceps. It may be that older, better educated women are more strongly influenced . by the choices obstetricians would make for themselves, or that their . own preferences more closely mirror these views. The authors said: 'There are several . studies reporting strong personal preferences among some obstetricians . for scheduled caesarean section, and indeed many of the private patients . were health professionals.' But they said that it was not . possible to determine whether the decision to give birth via C-section . was driven by the expectant mother or the doctors caring for them. Caesarean section carries a certain . amount of risk - such as the wound becoming infected or the baby . developing breathing difficulties. It also takes longer to recover than . after a vaginal birth. The researches wrote: 'Although speculative, it . seems quite likely that private patients are provided with greater . choice in relation to a scheduled caesarean section. It is debatable . whether this is actually in the womanâ€™s best interest, particularly when . it comes to the next birth. The Royal College of Midwives said the study highlights the need to avoid 'unnecessary' Caesarean sections . 'What does need to be addressed is . whether higher rates of scheduled caesarean sections among private . patients create access issues for medically indicated caesarean . sections, and whether these patients place a disproportionate burden on . the service in the postoperative period.' The Royal College of Midwives said the study highlights the need to avoid 'unnecessary' Caesarean sections. Janine Stockdale, research fellow at the RCM, said: 'This is interesting research that may throw a spotlight on the high rates of Caesarean sections that we are seeing in Western Europe including the UK, a number that we would like to see falling. 'The findings also underline the need to avoid unnecessary Caesarean sections as this is a major surgical operation, that has the potential for increased complications every time a woman has the procedure carried out. 'The RCM therefore supports National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines which encourage women to have a thorough discussion with their obstetricians and midwives about the implications of having a Caesarean section, especially in circumstances where other options remain open to them.'","Study published in the BMJ supports theory about middle class mums .

The names were submitted by Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai, U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, panda keepers at the National Zoo, the fundraising group Friends of the National Zoo and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda.

Giant pandas are considered critically endangered in the wild, and breeding them in captivity has proved difficult, especially in Washington. Zoo scientists have made numerous attempts to artificially inseminate its female panda because the pair failed to breed naturally. The new birth has given zoo scientists renewed confidence in the Washington pandas' ability to help grow the panda species. Last year, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub, but it died after six days because its lungs hadn't fully developed and weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver.

David Cameron has distanced himself from Boris Johnson's controversial suggestion that one in six people is too stupid to get on in life. The Prime Minister, speaking for the first time about the London Mayor's remarks, said he believed in equality of opportunity for all. In a speech last week, the Mayor, seen as one of Mr Cameron's chief rivals for the Conservative leadership, said equality was unachievable when 16 per cent of the 'species' have an IQ of under 85. David Cameron, pictured after meeting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during trade talks in Beijing, hit back at Boris Johnson's comments . His remarks prompted a storm of criticism, with Deputy Prime Minister branding them 'careless' and 'unpleasant' and accusing him of talking about people like dogs. Some critics have suggested the row will dent Mr Johnson's chances of succeeding Mr Cameron and help ensure Home Secretary Theresa May does so instead. Mr Cameron and his key ally George Osborne appear to be revelling in Mr Johnson's discomfort. Speaking on a trip to China, the Prime Minister made clear he disagreed with the Mayor. 'I let Boris speak for himself,' the Prime Minister said. 'I think it's very important that we make sure we do everything so that we maximise people's opportunities to make the most of their talents. 'I believe in equality of opportunity. No-one should be held back by not being able to get the training, the education, the skills that they need. Everyone has their own way of putting these things and I'll leave Boris to talk to Boris.' Delivering last week's Margaret Thatcher Lecture – staged by the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies think-tank – Mr Johnson insisted the rich had a duty to help the poor and embrace philanthropy. And he urged the Government to do much more to help bright children from poor homes to get a good education. He called for the reintroduction of John Major’s assisted places scheme, which paid for the brightest poor children to go to public schools – and accused the Tories of hypocrisy for blocking a revival of the grammar school system. London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured on a visit last week, said some people were simply not bright enough to succeed in the modern world . But his most controversial comments came when he said globalisation was intensifying the trend towards inequality. Mr Johnson said: ‘I am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in raw ability, if not spiritual worth. ‘Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely  relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130. London Mayor Boris Johnson . ‘The harder you shake the pack, the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top. And for one reason or another – boardroom greed or, as I am assured, the  natural and God-given talent of boardroom inhabitants – the income gap between the top cornflakes and the bottom cornflakes is getting wider than ever. ‘I stress I don’t believe that economic equality is possible. Indeed, some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.’ Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister condemned the comments for revealing a 'fairly unpleasant, careless elitism' that siuggested giving up on 'a whole swathe of our fellow citizens'. He added: 'To talk about us as if we are a breed of dog, a species he called it... I think the danger is if you start taking such a deterministic view of people and start saying they’ve got a number attached to them, in this case an IQ number, somehow they’re not really going to rise to the top of the cornflake packet... 'That is complete anathema to everything I’ve always stood for in politics, which is, yes of course, you shouldn't aspire - and as an old-fashioned Liberal I don’t aspire to a perfectly homogenous society where everyone has the same kind of outcomes but you’ve got to try and do more to instil greater opportunity in society.' And yesterday Chancellor George Osborne joined the chorus of disapproval. 'I wouldn't have put it like that. I don't agree with everything he said,' Mr Osborne said. 'You can't achieve equality of outcome but you should be able to achieve equality of opportunity. Education is, I think, the best key to this.' Mr Johnson appeared to echo the film character Gordon Gekko (pictured), whose notorious motto was 'greed is good', saying that greed was 'a valuable spur to economic activity' ON INTELLIGENCE . ‘Whatever . you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a . conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species . have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130.’ ON GREED . ‘I . don’t believe that economic equality is possible. Indeed, some measure . of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with . the  Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.’ ON THE RICH . ‘I . hope that this time the Gordon  Gekkos of London are conspicuous not . just for their greed ... as for what they give and do for the rest of . the population.’ ON GRAMMARS . ‘I . remember once sitting in a meeting of the Tory shadow education team . and listening with mounting disbelief to a conversation in which we all . agreed solemnly that it would be political madness to try to bring back . the grammar schools ... most of the people in that room were about to . make use, as parents, of some of the most viciously selective schools.’ ON IMMIGRATION . ‘It’s . time to sort out the immigration system so that we end the madness ... we are claiming to have capped immigration by having a 60 per cent . reduction in New Zealanders, when we can do nothing to stop the  entire . population of Transylvania –  charming though most of them may be – from . trying to come here.’","London Mayor said only those with high IQs could rise to the top .

Varlamov appeared in court for a brief hearing as the judge formally advised him that he faces a misdemeanor charge of third-degree assault. He said nothing as he left the courtroom with his lawyers - obviously pleased with the outcome. His agent has protested his innocence and the 25-year-old is not due to enter a plea until his next hearing on January 22 where he will face one count of third-degree assault and if convicted, could receive a sentence ranging from probation to two years in prison. All smiles: Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov leaves county court after a hearing in Denver, on Monday, Dec. 2, 2013. A judge has allowed Varlamov to remain free on bond while facing a domestic violence charge involving his girlfriend . Most misdemeanor cases in Denver are settled with plea bargains, but a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office declined to say whether an agreement was likely in this case. Neither Varlamov nor his attorneys commented when they left court Monday. Varlamov's girlfriend, Evgeniya Vavrinyukat, told police he knocked her down with a kick, stomped on her chest and dragged her by her hair at their apartment on Oct. 30, according to an arrest affidavit. She also accused him of telling her that he would have beaten her more if they had been in Russia, authorities said. He wore a blue suit and open-collar white shirt in court on Monday and gave yes or no answers to the judge. Varlamov, 25, is one of NHL's hottest goalies and has helped the Avalanche to a franchise-best 19-6 start.

He is free on $5,000 bond and has been traveling and playing with the team. The judge has ordered him to stay away from his girlfriend and told him he could not drink alcohol or possess firearms. The NHL has released a statement following the charge: . 'We are aware of the decision made by the Denver District Attorney's Office today to pursue misdeamnor assault charges against Avalanche Player Semyon Varlamov. While we will continue to monitor the situation, we do not expect to take any action or have any further comment pending the resolution of those charges.' Vavrinyuk had been dating Varlamov on and off for a year. She described in court how her six-foot-two, 209-pound goalie boyfriend kicked her in the chest and stomped on her as she lay on the ground, before he dragged her by her hair from their bedroom in the early hours of the morning on October 30. ‘He was having fun, he was laughing,’ said the model. ‘He has no concept of when to stop drinking, and when he drinks he turns into an animal.’ She pointed to her chest, arms, stomach, neck and head - places she said she are bruised. She also said he kicked her out of the apartment, reports The Denver Post. Charged: Russian Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov has been charged with third-degree assault, and could face two years prison . Violent: Evgeniya Vavrinyuk told investigators that Varlamov kicked her in the chest, knocking her down, and stomped on her chest as she lay on the ground in her apartment . Vavrinyuk admitted it wasn't the first time that her boyfriend had hurt her, but throwing her out on the street was ‘the final straw.’ ‘She wants to make sure he is punished for this,’ Vavrinyuk said through Diana Senova, an interpreter and the fiancee of her attorney, Robert Abrams. ‘Varlamov is very arrogant and thinks he can get away with anything, that he can beat her up and no one will ever know about it.’ She said her boyfriend had beat her at least four times before in other countries, but she had remained hopeful that he could change, as she loved him and wanted to have children with him. She said she broke a modeling contract in Hong Kong so she could come to Denver to be with him ‘because he asked her to,’ Senova said. According to news reports, Varlamov and Vavrinyuk, known to her friends as ‘Evie,’ have been in a rocky relationship disrupted by breakups. His agent, Paul Theofanous, said Varlamov ‘is completely innocent of all of these charges.’ Acquired from Washington in a 2011 trade, Varlamov is 7-1 this season with a 1.76 goals-against average. Last year, the goaltender earned $3 million. Beauty and the 'Beast': Varlamov's on-again, . off-again girlfriend Russian model Evgenia Vavrinyuk (right) accused the . NHL star of dragging her by the hair, pushing her to the floor and . stomping on her in a drunken rage . According to court documents made public on Thursday, Varlamov told Vavrinyuk in Russian that 'if this were Russia, he would have beaten her more,' Varlamov was initially also charged with second-degree kidnapping, but that charge has been dropped. The alleged lovers quarrel took placed on Monday at the couple’s apartment in the 1700 block of Bassett Street in Denver. Varlamov’s arrest warrant and affidavit state that the 25-year-old athlete held his girlfriend’s face to the floor, grabbed her by her arms and shook her before pushing her down to the floor. 'Her statement is that this is the most minor of the beatings she received. She's received five in all, and the last one was to unconsciousness,' said Vavrinyuk's attorney Robert Abrams. ‘This time Evie said to us, “That’s it, go lock him up,”’ Abrams said. ‘This girl is 5-foot-3, 100-and-nothing pounds; he’s a 6-foot-2, 210-pound professional athlete. This is a very sizable force approaching you. This is terrifying.’ Varlamov’s father, Alexander, downplayed the domestic violence case and came to his son's defense in an interview with Russia's R-Sport. 'I can only say one thing with complete responsibility: No crime has been committed whatsoever,' he stated, adding that his son has ‘no serious issues.’ Stunner: The Russian model told police in Denver that her boyfriend struck her in the chest and warned her in Russian that were they back home, he would have given her a harsher beating . It has been widely speculated that Varlamov is expected to be invited as the starting goalie for the Russian Olympic team during the Winter Games in Sochi next year. In light of his arrest, some Russian officials wasted no time accusing the United States of sabotage. State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, called Varlamov's arrest a 'sports and political move.' ‘The main goal is to suspend him from training and games so that he loses practice and misses the Olympics,’ said Ananskikh. Rising star: Varlamov is among the NHL leaders in goals-against, wins and save percentage . The LDPR member has vowed to use his sway as the head of the Russian parliament's physical training and sports committee to 'influence the situation.' According to the Russian tabloid Dni.ru, Varlamov and the blonde fashion model called it quits at least once before, but the woman, who resides mostly in Russia, returned to Denver for a three-month stay and moved back in with him. In response to Varlamov's arrest, the model wrote on her Russian social media account VKontakte, which has since been deleted: 'If a man has raised his hand against a woman - he will do it again. And no amount of oaths and assurances should shake a woman's resolve.’","Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov, 25, has been charged with third-degree assault .

Walter Ellis, 53, died at a Sioux Falls hospital Sunday from apparent natural causes according to officials at the South Dakota maximum-security prison where he was being held. For two decades, Ellis terrorized the women of north Milwaukee. He wasn't arrested until 2009 when advances in DNA technology connected him to the murders of seven African-American prostitutes. Out of jail: Serial killer Walter Ellis, 53, died from natural causes at a hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota Sunday near the maximum-security prison where he was serving seven consecutive life sentences . Ellis was able to remain free for so long because his DNA sample wasn't in a state database. Ellis should have submitted a sample when he was serving time for beating his girlfriend with a hammer in 2001, but instead persuaded another inmate to give his DNA instead. After investigators got an accurate sample from Ellis' toothbrush, they were able to match his DNA with semen found on six of the victims, as well as a pepper spray can discovered at the seventh scene. In the end, prosecutors brought up first-degree murder charges for Ellis' first two victims - 31-year-old Deborah Harris on October 10, 1986, and 19-year-old Tanya Miller who was found dead the following day. First victims: Ellis strangled 31-year-old Deborah Harris (left) and 19-year-odl Tanya Miller (right) on back to back days in October 1986 . Strangling grounds: The above graphic shows the geographic spread of Ellis' crimes in north Milwaukee . North side terror: Ellis killed 37-year-old Sheila Farrior (left)  in June 1995, and 28-year-old Florence McCormick (right) in April 1995. Like most of Ellis' victims, they were killed in north Milwaukee . Targeted: 41-year-old Joyce Mims (left) was found dead in June 1997. Ellis' final victim was Ouithreaun Stokes, 28 (right), in April 2007. All of the women Wllis was convicted of killing were African-American prostitutes . For the five victims that followed, Ellis was charged with intentional homicide. Those victims included Irene Smith, 25, in November 1992; Florence McCormick, 28, in April 1995; Sheila Farrior, 37, in June 1995; Joyce Mims, 41, in June 1997; and Ouithreaun Stokes, 28, in April 2007. All of Ellis' victims were strangled to death, and one of them was also stabbed. While Ellis originally plead . not-guilty to the charges, he changed his plea on February 18, 2011 to . no contest and was convicted of the seven killings. Ellis . was handed seven life sentences for the crimes about a week later. The . sentences were to be served consecutively without the possibility of . parole. Under investigation: Ellis' death is being investigated as is standard procedure . In addition to the crimes he was convicted of, police tied Ellis to additional slayings. One for another prostitute, 32-year-old Carron Kilpatrick, and for white runaway Jessica Payne, 16, in 1996. Chaunte Ott actually spent 13 years in prison for Payne's murder, but was freed when DNA found on Payne matched that found on two of Ellis' victims. Ellis didn't speak once during his trial, which left the reasoning behind the murders a mystery. 'Everyone wants to know why,' Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Dennis Cimpl said in February 2011. 'Unfortunately, Mr Ellis has the right not to tell us.' But the justice process did offer a platform for Ellis' wide-range of victims to finally make peace with the deaths of their friends and family. 'He didn't only kill my sister, he killed my mother - she died of heartbreak after that,' said Zola Farrior, sister of Sheila Farrior who was killed in 1995. Others took the trial as an opportunity to forgive Ellis. 'We're going to be all right,' said Patricia Donald, friend of Ellis' first victim Deborah Harris. 'You don't win. You don't get to destroy lives anymore. While Ellis' death is believed to be from natural causes, the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation is still investigating  which is standard procedure. He was being held at a South Dakota prison as part of an interstate deal with Wisconsin.","Walter Ellis, 53, died of natural causes at a Sioux Falls, South Dakota prison Sunday .

A shop worker says he has been discriminated against at work and accused of being lazy just because he is English. Ben Chaney, 20, claims that the manager of the pound shop where he has worked for six months treats him like a 'slave' and sometimes refuses to speak English to him. 99p Stores is now investigating the alleged discrimination, which is the second time in recent weeks that claims of ill-treatment at the company have emerged. Anger: Ben Chaney claims his manager at 99p Stores in Witham, Essex discriminates against the English . Mr Chaney says that he is one of just three English-born members of staff at the discount retailer's branch in Witham, Essex, out of a total of eight. 'I get treated like a slave,' he said. 'The manager is very rude, not just to staff but to customers as well - he's always shouting on the shop floor. 'He keeps saying English people are lazy. If he's got a problem with me, he doesn't tell me off in English, he does it in his own language so I can't understand him. 'The non-English staff are allowed to do what they want. They chat on the tills and take breaks when they want, but I get shouted at if I do the slightest thing wrong.' The young worker also alleged that he was told he was lazy for turning down shifts even when he had a legitimate excuse. Employer: The branch of 99p Stores in Witham is facing another claim of alleged discrimination . 'I don't have set hours so they tell me at short notice when I'm working, and if I say I can't do weekends they say I'm lazy or that I'm sleepy and I get threatened with the sack,' Mr Chaney said. 'When I was off with a back injury my boss tried to say it was an unauthorised absence. When I do complain or do something wrong I get shouted at and my hours are cut back.' Last month, 21-year-old Toni Sergeant said she was refused a job at the same branch because the manager told her English workers were unreliable. He later insisted he had been misunderstood, but said that English employees were more likely to quit because they are 'sleeping'. In response to Mr Chaney's allegations, a spokesman for 99p Stores said: 'We 100 per cent refute these allegations. We have investigated the matter relating to Toni Sargeant and are 100 per cent that this is not what was said. 'We believe this is due to a disgruntled employee who is spreading malicious rumours about our store management team. 'We have an equal opportunity employment policy and an investigation is still continuing. Therefore we cannot comment any further.'","Ben Chaney, 20, has worked at 99p Stores in Essex for six months .

Plea: Gary Lineker appealed for help on Twitter after his mother Margaret's car was stolen by thieves who followed her home from hospital . Gary Lineker's elderly mother was targeted by thieves who followed her home from the hospital where she was receiving dialysis before stealing her handbag and taking her car. The thieves watched as poorly Margaret Lineker, 74, used a cashpoint machine at the hospital, then tailed her back to the house. Her Vauxhall Corsa was stolen and more . than £1,000 was later spent on her bank card at a clothes store in . Gary's hometown of Leicester. The Match Of The Day host, 53, and brother Wayne turned to Twitter at the weekend to appeal to their combined two million followers for the return of the car. It has emerged that Margaret was the victim of calculating thieves, who are believed to have watched as she entered her pin number. The car was packed with personal possessions ahead of her planned move to a new home on the Isle of Wight, including an ornamental brass eagle named 'hat-trick' which she kissed every time Gary scored a goal for Leicester. The lucky charm had been a gift from Gary and Wayne. A good Samaritan later found the personal items dumped in a lay-by in the Syston area of Leicester and returned them to a police station. Margaret had been at hospital when she withdrew £200 from a cashpoint in the reception. She then went to her dialysis session before driving home, where the thieves struck within minutes, entering her porch and taking the bag. Wayne Lineker said: 'It's just beyond me how anyone could do this to a lady who turns 75 in March. 'She's had a terrible year as she lost her husband through cancer and now this. The first thing she did was ask for a big cuddle and broke down crying. Reward: The Match Of The Day presenter tweeted this appeal for help after his mother's car was stolen .

In court: Dajeon Franklin, pictured, was caught using stolen credit cards with his own rewards card . One of three alleged burglars suspected of gunning down a promising med student in his frat house was caught for an earlier break-in after using his Speedy Rewards card with stolen credit cards at a gas station, it has emerged. Dajeon Franklin, 21, today faces trial for being a lookout as friends allegedly stole laptops and a wallet from a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan in May. He was caught and arrested and while out on bail, he allegedly took part in another break-in that ultimately led to the death of 25-year-old prospective surgeon, Paul DeWolf, on July 24. Joei Jordan, 20, and Shaquille Jones, 21, have also been named as suspects in the July incident. The trio allegedly broke into the Phi Rho Sigma medical fraternity and entered DeWolf's basement bedroom, where they startled the promising student. DeWolf went to get something from his . dresser and one of the suspects tried to strike him with the gun, but it . fired instead, according to the statements. DeWolf died from a single wound to the neck. In the May incident, Franklin allegedly . served as a lookout for a friend as they broke into a home for . electronics and a wallet so that they could pay rent, Mlive reported. Victim: Paul DeWolf was found dead in his bedroom in a fraternity house in Ann Arbor, Michigan on July 24. The three suspects claimed they intended to hit him with the gun, but it went off instead, killing him . He used the stolen credit cards at three stores; at a gas station, he used his personal Speedy Rewards card at the same time as the purchase with the stolen credit cards, the police report said. 'I was also notified … that a Speedy . Rewards card was also presented at the time of the fraudulent use of the . credit card,' Ann Arbor police Detective Dave Monroe wrote. 'I learned through Speedway that the Speedy . Rewards card returned to a Mr. Dajeon Franklin.' Franklin . was arrested and charged with one count of second-degree home invasion and two counts of stealing a financial transaction device. He posted bond and was allowed to leave the Washtenaw County . Jail before his alleged part in the DeWolf killing. But Franklin has not been formally charged and his attorney, Walter White, has denied his involvement. He faces trial for the May break in Washtenaw County Trial court on Monday morning. Charged: Shaquille Jones, 21, left, was charged with murder and home invasion for DeWolf's death, while Joei Jordan, 20, right, wascharged with the lesser crime of receiving and concealing stolen property . Crime scene: Police tape is seen outside DeWolf's home after his body was discovered on July 24 . It comes after The Detroit Free Press obtained police statements from Jones, Jordan and Franklin, saying they had broken into Phi Rho Sigma fraternity and entered DeWolf's basement bedroom. Ann Arbor police Detective Katie Nucci recounted the statements at a November 22 warrant hearing for Jordan and Jones the newspaper said. Jones . said DeWolf got out of bed 'and was asking what was going on', the . detective testified. She said Jones told investigators that the third . suspect 'pulled out a handgun and pointed it' at the medical student and 'ordered DeWolf not to move'. 'At some point DeWolf grabbed . something off of his desk and/or drawer' and started to move toward the . third suspect, at which time the man 'raised the gun and attempted to . strike DeWolf with the gun, and the gun at that time fired.' DeWolf screamed, and the suspects ran off, Nucci testified. Using data about a stolen computer, . investigators tracked Jordan to Sumter County, South Carolina, and Jones . to North Charleston, South Carolina. Loss: Police say DeWolf, a top student, marathon runner and accomplished scuba diver, failed to arrive for a scheduled assignment at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital - and his body was later found . The next court dates are Thursday for Jones and December 12 for Jordan. DeWolf was an enlisted second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was . studying at university to complete his surgical training. He was in his fourth year of study when he was killed. He belonged to Sigma Phi Epsilon at Grand Valley State University and Phi Rho Sigma Fraternity at the University of Michigan. He was a brilliant piano and French horn player, traveled the world on several mission trips, loved scuba diving and had competed in . marathons. He was a devout Christian. A statement from the university said that DeWolf was the 'epitome of everything great in the field of medicine.' 'We extend our deepest condolences to Paul's family, friends and colleagues,' UM president Coleman added to the statement. 'He . was working and training among a close, nurturing community of healers . and I know they will help each other through this difficult time.

More bodies may be trapped beneath the police helicopter that plunged into a busy pub, officials feared last night. Nine people are now known to have been killed – including the doomed aircraft’s civilian pilot and two police officers on board – while 32 pub-goers were injured. As the scale of Friday night’s disaster in Glasgow unfolded, investigators refused to rule out foul play as they examined possible causes of the crash, including whether the pilot was shot at or blinded by a ‘laser pen’. Authorities fear more bodies may be trapped in the wreck of the pub after the helicopter crash . Aftermath: A helicopter rotor blade is lifted from the roof of the Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow . Wreckage: Emergency services working to clear the scene after the helicopter crashed into the roof of the pub on Friday night . Witnesses reported hearing the helicopter engine ‘misfiring’ at 10.25pm, and air accident investigators are examining whether there was a mechanical fault. But there were also fears the horrific accident could have been caused by a powerful green laser beam from a pen-like device shone into the eyes of the pilot – or even a firearm. There have been an increasing number of near-misses caused by the blinding laser devices in recent months. Police Scotland said investigators will ‘retain an open mind’. On a day of national mourning, Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmon warned that the death toll could rise. Witnesses said the police helicopter 'dropped like a stone' from the sky . Victim: PC Anthony Collins was commended last year for risking his life to save a drowning woman . He said last night: ‘I should say there’s an area which is still to be searched, the area which is underneath the helicopter itself. We have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that there could be further fatalities to come.’ The police helicopter fell out of the sky ‘like a stone’ and smashed through the roof of The Clutha, one of the city’s best-known pubs, when it was packed with 120 revellers on Friday night. The experienced pilot was named as David Traill, 51, a former RAF flight lieutenant who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. Tributes were paid to Mr Traill and the two police officers – Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43 – who had been returning from a police operation to their heliport two miles away. Among the fatalities in the pub was 48-year-old Gary Arthur, from Paisley, whose heartbroken daughter Chloe, 18, a Celtic and Scotland international footballer, paid tribute to him, saying: ‘I promise to do you proud. I love you with all my heart.’ Other families faced an agonising wait to see if their missing loved ones are discovered buried in the wreckage. A ninth body was found by emergency services on Sunday. DCC Rose Fitzpatrick said on Sunday: 'The site is extremely challenging and the efforts of colleagues from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and investigators have been painstaking. 'We can now confirm that Samuel McGhee died during the incident on Friday. Our thoughts are with his family and friends tonight as they are with all those affected by this tragedy. 'Sadly I can also confirm the discovery of a further body within the site. This takes to nine the total number of people who died on Friday night. 'Our absolute priority has been to locate the bodies of people who were within the pub at the time of the incident and recover them safely. 'This process takes time, as formal identification procedures have to take place before we can notify relatives and publicly confirm identities. 'We are doing all we can to support the families of those who have lost loved ones. It is essential that we maintain sensitivity and dignity for the families of the deceased.' The wreckage of the Eurocopter EC135 T2 will be transported to the headquarters of the Air Accident Investigation branch in Farnborough, Hampshire. After visiting some of the injured at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt humbled by the stories she had heard of off-duty medical staff rushing to work in the crash aftermath, and members of the public queuing to give blood the following morning. Brave: PC Kirsty Nelis, who was killed in the crash, won a commendation for tackling a hammer-wielding thug . Both police officers killed in the Glasgow helicopter tragedy had won praise for bravery. Kirsty Nelis, 36, won a commendation for tackling a hammer-wielding thug trapped in a lift with her, while Anthony Collins, 43, risked his life to save a drowning woman. The heroine policewoman was just 25 when she and a fellow officer had been called to reports of a dozen youths drinking and throwing bottles in Greenock, Renfrewshire. PC Nelis saw one of the teenagers vandalising a lift with a hammer and moved to arrest him. She recalled: ‘I was petrified – I felt the lift going up and I didn’t know when it was going to stop. I just had to get the cuffs on him and the hammer off him.’ In 2010, she married fellow officer Mark Nelis, now 46 and a community sergeant in their home district of Inverclyde. The couple – who had no children – last year bought a £250,000 detached four-bedroom house in Inverkip. Her brother, believed to be called Keith, is a fire officer in Glasgow and is understood to have been among the first to arrive at the horrific scene on Friday night. PC Nelis’s Facebook friends have changed their profile pictures to a thin blue line crossing a black square in her memory. Andrina Romano posted: ‘You will never be forgotten.’ PC Collins received a national award last year after diving into a canal to save a drowning woman. He is understood to have been married with at least one child, a boy in his teens. At the family’s semi-detached home in the Clarkston area of Glasgow last night, a relative said: ‘I’m sorry but we’re not saying anything at the moment.’ Those confirmed or feared dead among music fans at The Clutha pub included Gary Arthur, 48, a call centre worker. John McGarrigle, 59, a poet, was sitting at his usual table immediately beneath where the helicopter hit and has not been heard from since. His 39-year-old son, also called John, said: ‘Dad sat at the same place every night and he was sitting at a table exactly where the helicopter landed.’ He said he planned to stand outside The Clutha until all the casualties were removed. Mr McGarrigle Snr’s friend Sammy McGhee, 56, from Glasgow, was confirmed dead on Sunday. Mark O’Prey, 44, is believed to be another victim. Condolences came from the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the day after messages of support from the Queen and Prime Minister David Cameron. Charles wrote: ‘My wife and I wanted to send our most heartfelt thoughts and sympathy to the families of those who were lost or injured.’ The Clutha pub – a 1960s haunt of Billy Connolly and Gerry Rafferty – had been packed with revellers in high spirits when the stricken helicopter plummeted. Horrified witnesses saw the dark blue aircraft dropping ‘like a stone’ with its rotor blades not spinning. Inside, the band was playing so loudly that at first nobody realised what had happened. The helicopter's rear rotor blade is lifted from the site on Sunday and the wreckage will be analysed . John McGarrigle (left) is missing, feared dead, and his friend Sammy McGhee was confirmed dead on Sunday . A puff of dust and a wooden panel falling off a wall prompted a joke from one of the musicians of local ska band Esperanza, who said: ‘Looks like we’re bringing the roof down.’ But then, in horrifying slow-motion, the ceiling started to bow and collapse. A ‘whoosh’ sound filled the room, described by one witness as ‘like when you take the seal off something’. Shouts of alarm rang out and a thick cloud of ‘burning’ black dust swept through the crowd, then there was a loud crack as the mangled helicopter burst through the ceiling. Kenny Hamilton, a 48-year-old painter and decorator, was knocked sideways by the ‘buckling’ bar gantry, and suffered suspected cracked ribs. Surviver Craig Bain, 35, with his wife, visits the pub to lay flowers on Sunday . Nine people have been confirmed dead so far in the crash, however the death toll could still rise . That did not stop him helping several people lift the shattered bar so another injured man could get out. Another survivor, Grace Maclean, said: ‘I could barely see a few inches in front of me. I could feel hands grabbing me and people shouting, “Get out”.’ Alleena Coupe said she and her husband Gary were saved only because they had been sitting near the window of the busy bar, but had decided to move. She said: ‘The dust was choking, it burned our throats. People were running about and panicking.’ Yesterday some survivors made a painful return to the harrowing scene bearing flowers – and scars which may take a lifetime to heal.","Investigators not ruled out whether pilot was shot at or blinded by laser .

The government should tell people to use electric blankets to stay warm this winter, a former Tory frontbencher has suggested. Baroness Rawlings urged ministers to launch a campaign extolling the benefits of electric blankets as ‘the answer to many of the government’s aims’. She argued they are green, use little electricity and help to make homes for efficient. Warmth: Ministers should launch a campaign telling people to use electric blankets, a former government frontbencher has suggested . It follows Downing Street advising people to wear jumpers if they get cold, before later insisting it would not tell people how to stay warm. The government yesterday revealed plans to cut green levies by £50 on the average bill to counter claims it was failing to act on soaring costs. The Big Six energy firms have agreed to pass on the reduction or freeze bills until 20915, provided wholesale costs do not rise. But there are still warnings that with average bills still more than £1,400, many people will be forced to choose between heating and eating. Baroness Rawlings, a former Tory MEP and government whip, said electric blankets are green and efficient . Responding to the government’s announcement on bills, Baroness Rawlings said she backed measures to make homes more efficient. But she added: ‘Have the Government considered, as a simple, practical measure, encouraging people to use electric blankets?’ Baroness Rawlings, a former MEP and government whip, added: ‘They are the answer to many of the Government’s aims. They are very green as they use little electricity and they reduce the need for so much heating in the home. ‘They also make the home very energy efficient - that is, they cost less - which is what the Government seem to have as an aim.’ However, ministers are nervous of doing anything that risks looking like they are telling people how to avoid the cold. Energy minister Baroness Verma sidestepped the question on electric blankets, telling the House of Lords: ‘As with all measures, we need to be able to ensure that people are kept warm and safe and that they are not paying over the odds for energy. ‘There are measures in the Statement and measures that we are already undertaking that will help energy efficiency and help consumers to reduce their bills.’ Energy bills will still be higher than last winter, even after the government agreed cuts to controversial green levies which will save customers £50. Most of the Big Six had already announced rise of more than £100 this winter, before ministers moved to reduce the impact of government schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable insulate their homes. Yesterday British Gas said it will cut bills by £53 in January, SSE bills will fall by £50, while EDF said it would hold prices until 2015, but ministers admitted prices could still rise again. Checking the bill: Details of handouts of up to £1,000 for homeowners to spend on energy-saving measures have been revealed (file picture) The Government is cutting the cost of the energy company obligation (ECO), an insulation scheme delivered by major energy suppliers, in a move that should shave £30-£35 off bills, on average, next year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change also announced it is establishing a rebate, saving the average customer £12 on their bill for the next two years. Electricity companies will also take voluntary action to reduce network costs in 2014-15, funding a one-off reduction of around £5 on electricity bills. In addition, energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes, enabling costs to consumers to be spread out. Wrapped up: Downing Street denied that David Cameron was urging people to wear a jumper . It is notoriously difficult for a politician to tell people how to do something as simple as keeping warm. The risk is that even stating the obvious like putting on an extra layer leaves ministers, especially wealthy ones, of being out of touch. In October a Downing Street spokesman said people struggling to pay soaring heating bills should 'consider' putting on a jumper. After Labour leader Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of changing policy 'from ""hug a hoodie"" to ""wear a hoodie"", Number 10 rowed back. A spokesman said  it was 'entirely false to suggest the PM would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm'. Energy Secretary Ed Davey also admitted he did not know what temperature is own thermostat is set at at home because 'my wife tends to take care of that'. But he went on: 'I am sure people wear jumpers. I wear jumpers at home.' Sarah Newton, deputy chairman of the Tory party, produced an energy-saving guide for constituents telling them to shut their curtains. In the 28-page guide, the Falmouth and Truro MP said: 'Close your Curtains: As the days grow shorter as winter approaches, closing your curtains at dusk helps to stop heat escaping through windows. 'This is a simple and free way of reducing wasted energy and your energy bills.' And just yesterday a power boss sparked uproar by saying the amount of electricity families in Britain use is a ‘luxury’. The extraordinary claim by Chris Train, a senior director of the National Grid, coincided with energy companies refusing to rule out more price rises. Mr Train warned that providing ‘the luxury of electricity that we desire’ would mean customers paying billions more to upgrade the power network.","Ex-Tory frontbencher Baroness Rawlings calls for new campaign .

British manufacturers are the strongest in Europe with factory output growing at the fastest pace for nearly three years, figures showed yesterday. The closely-watched purchasing managers’ index of activity in the sector - where scores above 50 represent growth - rose from 56.5 in October to 58.4 in November. It was the eighth month of growth in a row, the highest level since February 2011 and significantly better than anything seen on the Continent. New orders rose at the fastest pace for 19 years amid increased demand for British goods from Asia, the United States, Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium and the Middle East . The revival in UK manufacturing - dubbed . the ‘march of the makers’ by George Osborne - has taken longer than hoped . but will ease fears that the recovery is too dependent on household . spending and the property market. The report, by research group Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, also showed British manufacturers are creating around 5,000 jobs a month. It was a further boost to Mr Osborne ahead of the Autumn Statement on Thursday when the Chancellor is expected to reveal that the economy is growing more than twice as fast as expected. The Office for Budget Responsibility looks set to raise its growth forecasts for 2013 from 0.6 per cent to around 1.4 per cent. The independent watchdog is also likely to say that the stronger than anticipated recovery means the government will borrow around £15billion less than feared this year. James Knightley, an economist at banking group ING, said: ‘The UK economy is looking in good shape.’ The UK manufacturing PMI of 58.4 was far stronger than the score of 51.6 clocked up in the eurozone in November. The Netherlands posted the highest score in the single currency bloc, with 56.8, but Germany only managed 52.7 and Italy 51.4 while Greece, Spain and France all saw factory output decline. The French reading of 48.4 was the worst in the region. Economist James Knightley . ‘France slipped to the bottom of the league table and was the only nation to report faster declines in both output and new orders,’ said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. ‘There’s still a lot to worry about in terms of the health of the eurozone economy. The big concern is France.’ New orders rose at the fastest pace for 19 years amid increased demand for British goods from Asia, the United States, Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium and the Middle East. The report also showed that more jobs are being created in the sector than at any time since May 2011. Markit said the figures suggested that manufacturing is on course to beat the 0.9 per cent growth it notched up in the third quarter of the year with the pace of growth so far in the fourth quarter comfortably above the 1 per cent mark. This year 1.73billion bricks will be produced in the UK, the highest number since before the 2008 financial crash, according to the Brick Development Association . David Noble, chief executive of CIPS, hailed an ‘all-round glowing performance’ for the sector. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The improvement in manufacturing in November should help to ease concerns that the recovery is entirely founded on an unsustainable housing market boom.’ The news came after it emerged last . week that factories will produce 1.73billion bricks in 2013, enough to . go 9 times round the earth.

Families have been cashing in their savings at the fastest rate in 40 years. A total of £23billion was taken out of long-term savings accounts over the past 12 months – the equivalent of £900 a household. The Bank of England figures suggest that record low interest rates have pushed people to spend their cash instead of saving it. It is thought the increased withdrawals have been spent on consumer goods, boosting the economic recovery. The 4.7 per cent drop in the long-term savings is the biggest fall since the 1970s, according to analysis by Sky News. Experts have raised questions about the sustainability of the economic recovery and will urge the Chancellor to encourage saving in his autumn statement. However, sources have suggested George Osborne may instead cap the maximum amount savers can put in to tax-free ISAs. Former Downing Street adviser Ros Altmann said yesterday: ‘The figures are desperately worrying. People are stopping saving for the long term because all the policies of the last few years mean you would be a mug to save. ‘The problem is no economy can thrive in the long run without people saving. You can’t run it on borrowing and debt, you need to save and invest for the future. If you just withdraw money and spend you are talking about a recipe for long-term economic decline.’ Savings grew during the beginning of the credit crunch with £13.9billion being put away in the 12 months up to October 2009. Deposits increased by £14.6billion the following year. But interest rates plummeted below two per cent after the launch of the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending scheme last year. A total of £23billion was taken out of long-term savings accounts over the past 12 months - the equivalent of £900 a household . Campaigners say the scheme, which offers cheap funding for high street banks in the hope they lend to businesses, discouraged banks from offering high interest rates to savers. Simon Ward, an economist at City stockbroker Henderson Global Investors, said: ‘Consumer strength usually reflects increased borrowing but this hasn’t been the key factor recently. ‘Instead households have been running down their savings account balances, probably in reaction to the pathetic interest rates now on offer. ‘Increased spending is lifting growth and incomes, and money is flowing back to other households in a virtuous circle.’","£900 a household cashed in according to Bank of England figures .

There's something rotten in Christmas tree country and it means some farmers are looking overseas for a solution. Phytophthora root rot, caused by a waterborne mould, is an issue with fir producers nationwide. Jeff Pollard trudged up the steep slope and stopped at a desiccated, rust-brown tree. Two months earlier, workers had tagged this Fraser fir as ready for market. It was going to be someone's Christmas tree. And now it was dead. Scroll down for video... Rotten: Tree farmer Jeff Pollard inspects a Turkish fir seedling on one of his farms in Bakersville, North Caroline. He's been growing Fraser fir for 40 years, but a root-rotting mold has him looking to the Turkish species to help save his family farm . Finding the cure: While researchers try to unlock the genetic code to root rot, some farmers are trying Turkish fir as an alternative. Fraser fir farmer Jeff Pollard sold his first Turkish trees last year, and his customers raved . 'Never get paid back for this tree,' he said with a shrug. 'Eleven years of work — gone.' The culprit: Phytophthora root rot, a water mold that, once in the soil, makes it unfit for production. Pollard has been growing Fraser fir in these western North Carolina mountains for nearly 40 years. To him, it's 'the ultimate tree.' But this persistent problem has him looking to a species from the birthplace of old Saint Nicholas himself for a possible alternative. And he's not alone. Growers in Oregon, the nation's No. 1 Christmas tree producer, have been experimenting with the Turkish fir for more than 30 years. That species and the Nordmann fir, also native to Eurasia, have shown promising resistance to root rot. 'Phytophthora is a problem in most areas where true firs ... are grown,' said Gary A. Chastagner, a plant pathologist and extension specialist at Washington State University. 'It's a national problem.' Looking abroad: Root rot is threatening traditional Christmas fir trees, and growers are scrambling to find a solution this year. Phytophthora root rot, caused by a waterborne mold, is an issue with fir producers nationwide . Oregon leads the nation in Christmas tree production, with nearly 7 million harvested in 2007, the latest figures available from the National Christmas Tree Association. North Carolina was a distant second, with around 3.1 million trees cut. One study estimated the potential losses to Oregon's nursery and Christmas tree industries of up to $304 million a year if Phytophthora is not properly contained. Douglas and Noble fir are the dominant holiday tree species in the Pacific Northwest. In North Carolina, the No. 2 producer, it costs farmers up to $6 million a year, said John Frampton, a Christmas tree geneticist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. To date, no fungicide has proven effective to control Phytophthora on Christmas tree plantations. So once it's in the soil, that's it. Pollard, who grows about 130,000 trees on several western North Carolina farms, said Phytophthora set in after Hurricane Fran in 1996 and got worse following 2004's Hurricane Ivan. He's lost about a quarter of his trees over the past six seasons, and the state rated the mortality on some of his stands at up to 80 percent. 'They'll be good for growing grass,' he said as he stood overlooking several barren hilltop fields recently. Researchers at Washington State and several other universities are hoping to unlock the secrets to some species' rot resistance. Rotting: Once root rot gets into the soil, the water mold makes it impossible to grow healthy trees like the Fraser fir, which along with the Douglas and Noble is one of the most classic Christmas trees . In a greenhouse on the campus of NC State, master's student Will Kohlway looked over rows of fir seedlings that had been inoculated with Phytophthora. He's looking for genes related to disease resistance in Turkish fir. 'And if we can identify the gene, maybe we can go out and ... possibly we can speed up the hybridization and get something to the growers faster,' he said. But what works in North Carolina might not necessarily help in the Northwest, where other species of Phytophthora are more common, said Chastagner. Katie McKeever, a Ph.D. candidate in Chastagner's lab, is working under a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to create a nationwide collection of Phytophthoras from Christmas trees to understand regional variation in pathogen populations. The goal is to challenge various firs with different Phytophthoras to determine mechanisms of resistance and ultimately develop genetic markers that can be used to identify trees that are resistant to the disease, Chastagner said. But until native trees can be modified to have greater resistance, Pollard and others are looking toward these other species. Since 2004, Oregon growers have planted an average of 500,000 Nordmann and Turkish firs per year, with similar activity in western Washington and the Inland Empire, said Chastagner. A three-year project by WSU Puyallup to identify superior sources of Nordmann and Turkish fir has resulted in the development of seed orchards for those species. Trials: Christmas tree geneticist John Frampton and student Will Kohlway inspect infected fir seedlings. Researchers are looking for the gene that lends rot resistance to some fir species in hopes of helping Christmas tree farmers stem losses . Pollard planted his first seedlings about six years ago and sold his first trees last year. He said his customers were 'tickled to death.' 'We followed them all the way through, from when they put them up to when they took them down,' said Pollard. 'And they were happy and so now we're sure of the tree.' Of course, the Turkish fir is far from bulletproof. It tends to bud out earlier than Fraser fir, making it vulnerable to late-season frosts. And deer find it irresistible. 'They'll walk by Fraser fir to snack on the Turkish fir,' Frampton said with a chuckle. After the success of his first sales, Pollard ordered enough Turkish fir seedlings from Oregon for a full rotation. He expects to plant them this spring. Tis' the season: Growers in Oregon ¿ the biggest producer of Christmas trees ¿ and North Carolina, among other places, are looking to different species that are resistant to the root rot . On a recent sunny afternoon, Pollard stood on a hillside as seasonal workers cut, baled and stacked trees — some of which he's waited 17 years to harvest. Looking down, his hands were stained with fragrant sap. 'That sap, it kind of runs in your blood,' he said. 'These Fraser fir are to the mountain people what the buffalo was to the Plains Indian. ... These Christmas trees have kept family farms in families. And we're very thankful for them.' Pollard's two sons, David and Jeff, have joined him in the business. At 61, he knows he has to prepare for the future. 'When we plant something, we're not thinking about one president away or two presidents. Sometimes it's three and four presidents down the road,' he said. 'I'm banking on this tree to keep me in the Christmas tree farming business.'","Phytophthora root rot is a stubborn enemy for some Christmas tree growers .

Ed Miliband was last night accused of backsliding from his pledge to wean Labour off its reliance on union funding by delaying reform for five years. The Labour leader had previously vowed to overhaul party funding to give union members more rights to opt out of funding Labour through the political levy. He made the promise in the wake of the Falkirk candidate selection scandal, which laid bare Labour’s reliance on the union Unite. Ed Miliband was last night accused of backsliding from his pledge to wean Labour off its reliance on union funding by delaying reform for five years . But it has now emerged that Mr Miliband only wants to give that option to new union members and to enact the changes over five years. The move is seen by critics as an attempt to appease Labour’s union paymasters, whose funding accounts for around £8 out of every £10 raised since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010. It is also seen as a ploy for the cash-strapped party not to lose its main revenue stream. In July, Mr Miliband vowed to reform funding, saying: ‘You have my word that this reform will be thorough, wholesale and lasting.’ Last night Grant Shapps, chairman of the Conservative Party, said: ‘In the summer, Ed Miliband promised to take on Len McCluskey’s Unite union by reforming the Labour Party’s link with the unions. ‘But now we learn that Ed Miliband is buckling under pressure from his union paymasters and watering down his reform proposals. ‘Once again, Ed Miliband has shown he’s too weak to stand up to the union barons fixing his own party’s selections. And if he’s too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey, Ed Miliband’s too weak to stand up for hard-working people.’ Mr Miliband is now locked in talks with the unions and Lord Collins, former general secretary of the party, according to the Guardian. Unite’s executive will meet next week to decide whether to back the reform, which Mr Miliband said is designed to mend, not end, the party’s union link. Unions fear their voting rights at the Labour conference and in leadership elections could be slashed if they sever the funding link. He made the promise in the wake of the Falkirk candidate selection scandal, which laid bare Labour's reliance on the union Unite. (General Secretary Len McCluskey pictured) Jim Kelly, chairman of the London and eastern region of Unite, said: ‘Our executive has got to keep a collective voice and that collective voice has to be expressed through the block vote at a decision-making party conference where unions keep 50 per cent of the vote. That is the main point. ‘If unions stand together, with half the votes at Labour’s conference, and supported by many constituency parties worried about the severe threat to the party’s finances from Ed Miliband’s proposals, as well as the negative impact on the left within the party, then the link can be successfully defended. ‘The changes that were proposed were not thought through and they are both bad for the unions and bad for the party.’ Grant Shapps, Chairman of the Conservative Party criticised the move. ‘In the summer, Ed Miliband promised to take on Len McCluskey’s Unite union by reforming the Labour Party’s link with the unions.

Guilty: Karl Addo, 30, admitted manslaughter after stabbing his flatmate before decapitating him with a meat cleaver . A paranoid schizophrenic laughed as he brutally knifed his flatmate to death before decapitating him with a meat cleaver. Karl Addo, 30, launched the 'prolonged and horrific' attack on Spanish student Sergio Marquez at their Bournemouth flat on the 23-year-old's birthday. Addo repeatedly stabbed his victim during the 20-minute attack, knifing Mr Marquez in the chest before striking him numerous times with a meat cleaver. A court today heard Addo struck Mr Marquez with such force that the handle of the cleaver snapped. A neighbour heard Mr Marquez beg Addo to stop the attack by repeatedly yelling ‘please, Karl’ and then the sound of laughter. Mr Marquez’s headless and mutilated body was discovered a short time later when three of his friends turned up at the flat for the celebrations. The trio - two girls and a man - fled the gruesome scene screaming for help after Addo fled the property covered in blood. Bournemouth Crown Court heard that Addo, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter after denying a charge of murder, had a history of mental illness and was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005 when he was living in Atlanta, US. He came to UK in 2008 to study aerospace engineering at university in London but endured delusions of being attacked by a gang and injected with drugs. In October 2011 - nine months before he killed Mr Marquez - a Mental Health tribunal ruled Addo should be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. But Addo absconded the hearing and disappeared. In February last year he was thrown out of Heathrow Airport for sleeping rough and moved to Bournemouth a month later. He moved in to the flat but was due to be evicted on the day of the killing after his flatmates complained to their landlord about Addo’s behaviour. Birthday celebrations: Sergio Marquez, pictured, had invited friends to celebrate his 23rd birthday on the day of the attack. Three friends arrived to find Addo fleeing the flat covered in blood . Gruesome discovery: The trio went inside the flat after Addo fled past them, finding a large cleaver in the sink with a broken handle and their friend's headless and mutilated body in one of the bedrooms . Prosecutor Nigel Pascoe QC, told the court: 'There was tension in the flat. The flatmates let it be known Mr Addo was difficult to live with. 'He was untidy and he ate food that was not his. They complained to the landlord that led to him serving notice. 'On the morning July 17, 2012 Sergio stayed at home while the other two flatmates left the house. 'In the afternoon the landlord spoke to Mr Addo to make sure he was going to leave that day as agreed.' At about 3.30pm a neighbour said they heard an arguement coming from the property. Mr Pascoe said: 'He heard the words ""please, Karl, please, Karl."" 'He heard noise at it sounded like a tormented voice. It lasted for 15 or 20 minutes. He heard a voice laughing and after that all was silent. It was the defendant laughing. 'He did hear at least part of the prolonged and violent attack on Mr Marquez.' A short time later three friends of Mr Marquez arrived at the flat but failed to get an answer at first. Devastated: paying tribute to her son, Mr Marquez's mother Maria Marquez Torres said: 'He was handsome, happy, kind, healthy, responsible, fun, and polite. He is a person that is impossible to replace' Mr Pascoe said: 'They looked through the letterbox and could see the defendant running between the bedroom and bathroom. 'Finally the defendant opened the door. He ran past them and then it was plain to them that he was covered in blood. 'They went inside the flat and looked in the bedrooms. There was a large cleaver in the sink with a broken handle. 'They went into another bedroom and the victim was lying on the bed. He was headless and his stomach had been mutilated. 'The two girls run screaming onto the road and three builders entered the flat and saw the body and called the police.' Addo was arrested minutes later fleeing down a nearby road with two knives in his pocket. After being taken into questioning he was detained under the Mental Health Act and held in Broadmoor. Crime scene: Police outside the flat in Bournemouth, Dorset where Spanish student Mr Marquez's body was found last July . Addo pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility today. The case was adjourned and Addo, of no fixed address, will be sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on Wednesday. Addo pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder. The lesser charge of manslaughter was accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service. In paying tribute to Sergio, his mother Maria Marquez Torres said: 'Sergio had everything. He was handsome, happy, kind, healthy, responsible, fun, and polite. He is a person that is impossible to replace. 'He had such a beautiful life. He wanted to be a father and have three children, and the thought of this filled him with excitement.'","Karl Addo pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Bournemouth Crown Court today .

More bricks will be made this year than at any point since the financial crash, as the economic recovery fuels a boom in house building. Factories will produce 1.73billion bricks in 2013, enough to go 9 times round the earth. Ministers say the humble brick is a key barometer of economic growth, and demand is up by 18 per cent on last year. This year 1.73billion bricks will be produced in the UK, the highest number since before the 2008 financial crash, according to the Brick Development Association . Orders for bricks are so high that kilns will be kept firing over Christmas for the first time since 2007 before the financial crash sent construction into freefall. The 1.73billion bricks manufactured in 2013 is up from the 1.46billion produced last year, and the highest since 2.39billion made in 2007. Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said the government’s flagship Help to Buy mortgage scheme had helped to persuade builders to kickstart construction across the country. The first round of the scheme, where the state guarantees mortgages for those who struggle to save a large deposit, only applied to new homes in an attempt to stimulate demand and encourage more house building. Mr Hopkins said: ‘Help to Buy has not only helped thousands of hard working families get on the housing ladder, it’s also laid the foundations for a recovery in housebuilding, and confounded the critics who claimed it would have no impact on the supply of new homes.’ He was speaking on a visit to a new Chesterton brick factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme, which has created 51 jobs. Mr Hopkins added: ‘Enough bricks will be made in 2013 to go 9 times round the earth or build 28 St Pancras stations, and I’m hoping next year we’ll make enough to reach the moon.’ Housing minister Kris Hopkins (centre) visited Chesterton brick factory, which will keep kilns fired over Christmas for the first time since 2007 . Eight out of 10 bricks manufactured in the UK are used for housebuilding, while orders for all building materials are now growing at the fastest rate for 10 years. Latest figures show that construction in the three months to September was 4.1 per cent higher than the same time in 2012. The Help to Buy scheme was extended in October to offer state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent. It is expected to inject further activity into the market among credit-worthy buyers who have particularly struggled to get on the housing ladder or move up it since the financial crisis struck because they have a lack of upfront funds. House prices surged by 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November, marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years, Nationwide reported today. Prices have been rising every month for the last year and the latest monthly increase of 0.6 per cent took average UK house values to £174,566. The annual increase is the strongest seen since July 2010, but Nationwide said that despite the strong pick-up in the housing market, prices are still around 6 per cent below an all-time high recorded in 2007. Yesterday, the Bank of England took the first step in putting the brakes on the surging property market as it scrapped an initiative that has had a significant part to play in encouraging mortgage lending. Boom time: House prices rose 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November, marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years . Governor Mark Carney said the Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) stimulus was no longer needed amid rising house prices, and it would instead be focused on helping small business borrowing, which remains muted. Funding for Lending has offered lenders access to cheap finance on condition that they pass on the benefits to borrowers, and experts yesterday said that the Bank's move could spell the ""beginning of the end"" for ultra-cheap mortgage deals. Fears of a looming property bubble have been growing in recent months amid a string of reports suggesting demand in the housing market far outstrips the growth in the supply of homes. London in particular has seen strong demand this year, and Land Registry figures released yesterday showed that house prices in London were up by 8.7 per cent year-on-year in October. But the market remains patchy and prices in the North East have dropped by 3.1 per cent year-on-year, the Land Registry figures showed.","Factories will produce enough bricks to go 9 times around the earth .

Jasmine Baker, 17, from Australia’s Empire Bay, had travelled to the Indonesian island with friends. On Thursday she was the designated sober member of the party when they went to the Bounty nightclub. Lucky to be alive: Jasmine Baker, 17, was left fighting for her life after drinking a cocktail in a Bali bar that contained methanol . However, after just one cocktail she became seriously unwell and was airlifted to a Darwin hospital. Although results of the tests on the drink she consumed are yet to be completed, it’s thought that Jasmine suffered from methanol poisoning. The body cannot process methanol and it’s so toxic that just 30ml is enough to kill a human and even 10ml can render someone blind. Jasmine spent the weekend in hospital and has now been released, to the relief of her parents, Eileen and Errol. Eileen wrote on Facebook: ‘Jasmine is doing very well. She has been one lucky girl.’ Errol, meanwhile, warned all youngsters to be careful when in Bali. Hot spot: Bali is a popular holiday destination for Australians . He wrote online: ‘If you feel sick and your eye sight becomes fuzzy or blurred seek medical attention.’ Methanol is produced as a byproduct of a locally made drink called Arak. It needs to be removed to make the drink safe. Bounty’s operations supervisor, Dewa Mustika, told The Sydney Morning Herald that all their drinks comply with the law. He said: ‘All our drinks are legal. The health department and customs regularly check us. We have recently been awarded top 10 for safety and service in Bali and we never use anything illegal.’ He added that if they were selling badly made drinks, then more than one person would have fallen ill.","Jasmine Baker drank just one cocktail in Bounty bar, then became ill .

Worries: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured yesterday outside 10 Downing Street) admitted he fears online porn could harm his children . David Cameron yesterday admitted he fears online porn could harm his children. The Prime Minister says he worries when any of his three children ‘grab hold of the iPad’ because they risk seeing obscene images. ‘The world has changed so fundamentally with the internet that we’ve got some real threats there to our children and also from this appalling scourge of child pornography,’ he said. ‘We’ve got to take a lot of action.’ Mr Cameron is now pledging to ‘put the heat’ on web firms, making them do more to remove illegal child abuse images and protect children from legal porn. At a summit tomorrow, ministers and charities will demand action from internet service providers. TalkTalk and BT announced at the weekend that customers trying to view child sex abuse sites would be confronted with a pop-up warning. The ‘splash pages’ are aimed at deterring paedophiles such as Mark Bridger, who killed five-year-old April Jones after accessing sickening online material. Maria Miller, who is hosting the summit, is expected to ask other operators to follow suit. The Culture Secretary said: ‘These firms have an enormous responsibility to make sure our children are protected in the best way possible. Tackling this problem is not easy when technology changes and adapts at such a fast pace. ‘But I am determined to do all I can – and to encourage industry to do all it can – to put an end to it. ‘I will say that things need to change, that enough is enough, and when I do my children will be at the forefront of my mind, as they always are.’ Mr Cameron said there was no doubt that internet companies needed to do more on online pornography – the subject of a Daily Mail campaign. Access: The Prime Minister says he worries when any of his three children 'grab hold of the iPad' (file picture) On the issue of child abuse images, he told Sky News: ‘I’m not satisfied that internet companies do enough to help take them down. ‘That’s why we’re having this round table in government with them to really put the heat on, [to ask them to] work with the police, work with us so we can get these images off the internet and prosecute those who put them there. ‘As a parent I worry, and I know people watching this programme worry massively, about what our children can get to see when they grab hold of our iPad or log on to the internet. ‘There we need to make more progress of this issue of explaining to everybody that we want to have better filters that parents can switch on to stop access to certain sites and material.’ Mr Cameron hailed the fact that web companies have pledged to introduce clean public wi-fi, so youngsters will not be at risk of seeing porn at a Starbucks. His remarks came as a poll found a majority of the public were in favour of making search engines such as Google put automatic filters on adult sites. Fifty-four per cent believed the firms should no longer automatically provide links when people search for pornography sites. The YouGov survey of almost 1,900 people also found that women were strongly in favour of curbs on web porn. Seventy per cent want Google to automatically filter out porn – compared with 38 per cent of men. Last night a spokesman for the End Violence Against Women coalition said: ‘The poll shows many people, women in particular, recognise the damaging impact of pornography on children and want action. ‘We cannot continue to shrug our . shoulders about this huge cultural harm to our society. We are calling . on politicians of all parties to act.’ At the weekend, Google responded to . criticisms it was not doing enough by announcing that it will make . £3million available to tackle child porn, including the establishment of . a global database of child abuse images, making it easier to delete . them from the web. The firm is also offering more than £1million to independent software developers to produce tools to combat child porn. It comes on top of the £1million funding announced last week for the Internet Watch Foundation, which flags up illegal images. Google lets parents switch on a SafeSearch facility to filter out offensive material. But parents must turn it on themselves by clicking on the ‘settings’ icon at the top of the rage – it does not come on automatically. Scott Rubin, Google’s director of public policy, added: ‘We don’t rely simply on filtering technology to block child abuse images; we go beyond that. ‘Any implication that we aren’t doing anything, or we refuse to be part of removing this material, is wrong.’","PM says he worries when any of his three children 'grab hold of the iPad'

The wife of African warlord Charles Taylor (pictured) claims he has been 'humiliated' after being housed with 'common criminals' at a British jail . The wife of an African warlord who has been moved to a UK prison claimed his incarceration among 'common British prisoners' was 'humiliating'. Former Liberian president Charles Taylor has begun serving a 50-year sentence at HMP Frankland on the outskirts of Durham city for plotting some of the most heinous war crimes in history. His wife, Victoria Addison Taylor - who had a child with him while he was imprisoned elsewhere - revealed her husband's whereabouts and spoke of the 'humiliation' that the former head of state was being housed with murderers, terrorists and paedophiles. Speaking to a French journalist, she said: 'He is being incarcerated in Frankland Prison. 'They took him to this prison where high (risk) criminals, terrorists and other common British criminals are kept and he is being classified as a high risk prisoner. 'He is going through humiliation and you cannot treat a former head of state that way.' Taylor was moved from the Hague, where he had been since the start of his trial in 2007, to the high security prison, which houses 800 of the most dangerous offenders in the prison system. One source said that Taylor was 'keeping his head down' with many other prisoners not knowing who he was, while an expert on the prison system said Taylor was unlikely to be targeted and would be regarded as a celebrity. The 65-year-old former president lost his appeal in September over a catalogue of gruesome crimes committed by the Sierra Leonean rebels he aided and abetted during the country's bloody civil war. Convicted: The 65-year-old former Liberian president lost his appeal in September over a catalogue of crimes committed by the Sierra Leonean rebels he aided and abetted during the country's bloody civil war . The conflict claimed 120,000 lives and featured mutilations, drugged child soldiers and sex slaves. In 2006, the British government agreed to jail Taylor in the United Kingdom in the event that he was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) at his trial. The verdict in 2012 ruled that he was guilty of all 11 counts of aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity. Judges ruled that during his presidency from 1997 to 2003 and in exchange for 'blood diamonds' mined by slave labour, Taylor provided the rebels with arms and ammunition. Presiding Judge Richard Lussick said in his sentencing statement: 'The accused has been found responsible for aiding and abetting as well as planning some of the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history.' Taylor's family have alleged he is being ill-treated at Frankland Prison, but the claims have been dismissed as 'nonsense' by the Ministry of Justice. Civil war: In this June 10, 1997 file photo, soldiers from the Revolutionary United Front supported by Taylor ride in a pick-up truck at their base on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone . Former prisoner-turned newspaper prison correspondent Eric Allison said: 'HMP Frankland is probably about the most security-conscious prison in the country. 'He will be in a single cell and will have a fair bit of association with other prisoners. 'Whereas in a normal prison Category A prisoners are kept in a separate unit, at Frankland they are kept with the main population. 'He won't be on a special wing, unless he misbehaves and then he will be down the in segregation. 'He will be on what they call normal location and will wear yellow patches to signify he is an escape risk, or category A. 'Apart from that he will be given the opportunity to work in a workshop if he wants to.' Mr Allison added: 'I don't think he will be a target for anybody - he's not a sex offender. I think he will be treated as a bit of a celebrity.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'We don't comment on individual prisoners.'","Ex-Liberian president starting 50-year term at HMP Frankland near Durham .

A farmer's son suffering from a large facial tumour is looking for love after having life-changing surgery. Lalit Ram lived as a virtual recluse in his remote Indian village due to the condition neurofibromatosis which caused a large sagging tumour on his face. Desperately poor and unable to work, Lalit was left to care for his family's buffaloes in a tiny shed and even had to sleep there. Scroll down for video . Lalit Ram lived as a virtual recluse in his remote Indian village due to the condition neurofibromatosis which caused a large sagging tumour on his face . The 23-year-old said before the surgery: 'When I was a kid the tumour was smaller. It grew as I grew, but no one paid attention to it. 'Whatever work I do I do at home. If I go anywhere, people laugh and stare and I get embarrassed. 'I have problems eating and drinking. Sometimes I feel so lonely because I have no one to talk to. I cry when I am on my own. 'Because . I sleep in the shed with the buffalo, the mosquitoes bite me all the . time. It is so hot in that room I have to get up and walk around in the . middle of the night. 'I keep my feelings buried in my heart. I want to earn money, work hard, go out to work and get married. Lalit before (left) and after surgery (right). He said before his operation: ' If I go anywhere, people laugh and stare and I get embarrassed. I have problems eating and drinking. Sometimes I feel so lonely because I have no one to talk to. I cry when I am on my own' But his life has changed dramatically after an amazing team of doctors came together to help him. A new TV series of inspiring human stories reveals the pioneering surgery and follows the medical team as they battle to save Lalit and transform his life. Lalit, 23, said: 'I feel very happy because things are much better. Having the operation was scary because I didn't know if I would live or die. 'But I knew I had to go through with it because I couldn't carry on as I was. Not only was it making me sad, but it was making everyone around me sad. Now things are much better. Change: Since this picture was taken, Lalit's life has changed dramatically after a team of doctors came together to help him . 'I can go to work and earn money. And maybe now I can find a wife. 'My future wife should be a little educated, be able to run the household, maintain the house and be beautiful.' Villagers in remote Bihar, north India, are even planning to help Lalit by building him a home of his own. It was a massive change from just months earlier when doctors did not know if Lalit would survive surgery after he started bleeding excessively during the operation. Surgeons knew removing the tumours - caused by the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis - would be a huge risk after discovering Lalit's growth was packed with tiny blood vessels that would bleed heavily when cut. They also learned Lalit suffered from abnormally low levels of hemoglobin - a protein that transports oxygen in the blood - because of his poor nutrition. Lalit, who started developing the tumours as a child, was treated and opted to go through with the six-hour surgery last year despite the risks. Dr Vivek Kumar, of the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, explained before the operation: 'I have never seen such a big tumour in my career. 'With Lalit, the tumour extended from the forehead, over part of the cheek, part of the ear, going behind the ear, involving the neck, chin and even up to the chest. It was very complicated.' And there was a scare on the operating table when Lalit lost 1.5 litres of blood - five times the safe amount - and his vitals signs became critically unstable. Lalit's story can be seen in Elephant Man: Body Bizarre on TLC UK at 10pm on Monday November 18th. Neurofibromatosis is the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps. Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born. Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious. The condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. However, in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head. The confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and Proteus syndrome. However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive.","Lalit Ram, 23, lived as a virtual recluse in .

Chris Train said that in order to receive the 'luxury' of electricity, customers would have to pay for billions of pounds worth of infrastructure . A power boss sparked uproar yesterday by saying the amount of electricity families in Britain use is a ‘luxury’. The extraordinary claim by Chris Train, a senior director of the National Grid, coincided with energy companies refusing to rule out more price rises. Mr Train warned that providing ‘the luxury of electricity that we desire’ would mean customers paying billions more to upgrade the power network. His comments – described as ‘hugely misjudged’ by critics – came as the Big Six energy firms made a mockery of the Government’s latest attempt to bring down bills. Ministers unveiled measures which they promised would take £50 off the average bill. But power firms will not pass on the savings until deep into the winter months, leaving customers paying higher rates over Christmas. And despite trimming their tariffs, every major supplier yesterday left the door open for another crippling increase. It left Energy Secretary Ed Davey forced into the embarrassing admission that despite the £50 cut in green levies that energy firms have to pay, he was unable to promise that bills will not rise again. Mr Train made his comments when he was asked about the security of Britain’s energy supplies. Critics accused him of being ‘out of touch’ with the struggles ordinary families face in paying their bills. Labour energy spokesman Tom Greatrex said: ‘It’s a hugely misjudged comment. ‘Electricity is not a luxury. The reality is it’s hard for all but a handful of people to live without it. ‘If parts of the energy sector can’t understand that then little wonder that public anger over energy is the way that it is.’ Ann Robinson, director at price comparison site uSwitch, said: ‘To use the word luxury was misguided. Despite protests over sky-high bills last week, energy companies have refused to rule out yet more price rises . ‘That’s a very unfortunate was of describing something that’s absolutely essential to keeping the lights on.’ Family power bills have doubled in recent years as most have seen their incomes squeezed. Recent figures suggest 33,000 people will die from the cold in Britain this winter – many of them elderly and vulnerable. Subsidies . for wind farms and solar panels could face the axe after Energy . Minister Michael Fallon said it was ‘immoral’ to pin the cost on . taxpayers. The average household pays £30 a year for large-scale renewable schemes. They are the second biggest green levy on bills, after insulation schemes – which the Government has just cut. But subsidies often go to landowners who rake in thousands of pounds a year from green energy. Mr Fallon said wind farms and large solar farms were ‘mature technologies’ which no longer need to be subsidised. ‘It . is immoral for hardworking base-rate taxpayers to be lining the pockets . of landowners by funding large scale deployment of mature renewables . that shouldn’t need further subsidy. ‘Piling regressive taxes and green levies on to bills is unfair.’ Mr . Fallon said green policies are the only part of bills that could be . cut, as it is impossible to control world oil and gas prices. Five of the Big Six have already unveiled another round of inflation-busting price rises and the sixth, E.ON, will be announcing an increase on Friday. Mr Davey said he did not have the power to prevent prices rising again, despite the taxpayer-funded cut in green levies that are used to pay for homes to be insulated. ‘They [energy companies] are going to have to reduce bills for households compared to what they would have been,’ he said . But households will still face bills rising faster than inflation and critics said the move failed consumers. Clare Welton, from Fuel Poverty Action, said she ‘would not be surprised to see price rises in the coming months and years’ from ‘companies that have always put their shareholders’ returns before the right of their customers to keep warm and healthy’. And Miss Robinson said: ‘It’s vital that consumers do not walk away from this thinking that they have a cast-iron guarantee that they are protected from future hikes. They aren’t.’ And Adam Scorer from Consumer Futures . said £50 a year off bills ‘will not make a substantial difference to the . millions of people suffering fuel poverty’. British . Gas has said it will lower bills by £53 on January 1 as a result of the . green levy cut –  but that is not until customers have spent this month . paying full rates. Npower . – which announced the biggest recent price rise, 10.4 per cent – said . it would pass on the levy cut to consumers through a price freeze. Chief . executive Paul Masarra said: ‘We don’t plan to increase energy prices . before spring 2015 – unless there are increases in wholesale energy . costs or network charges.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey has admitted that even with the £50 cut to green levies for every customer, bill may still go up . Southern Electric owner SSE said it may not lower its prices until the end of March. ScottishPower boss Neil Clitheroe said: ‘We will continue to try and avoid further price rises in 2014, but this will depend on whether there are increases in wholesale energy prices or other costs outside our control.’ Experts have warned that Britain faces an energy crisis, with ageing power plants closing and plans to build new generators behind schedule. National Grid, which transports power and gas around the country, says it needs to spend billions upgrading its networks. A spokesman said: ‘In order to ensure that the UK continues to experience the secure and reliable electricity supplies that we need for homes and businesses, then there has to be investment in capacity and for that we need a stable investment environment.’","Chris Train, head of National Grid, said electricity was a 'luxury'

An air stewardess who was told she would never walk again after suffering from an extremely rare form of cancer will tomorrow jog through her home town carrying the Olympic torch. Bally Taylor, 37, was told her excruciating pregnancy pains were caused by a placenta cancer that would leave her paralysed for life. The condition is so rare that only six other women in the world have been affected by it. But Mrs Taylor has been told that the cancer is in remission, allowing her to carry the Olympic torch through her home town of Dunfermline, in Fife, Scotland.. Bally Taylor was told she would never walk again following her daughter Amara's birth in 2008 (right). But she proved doctors wrong and has returned to work as an air stewardess (left) Her battle began shortly before giving birth to her daughter Amara, now four, when she started to get severe pains in her back. Mrs Taylor went with her husband Gary, 35, to the doctors but they said that the baby was pressing against a nerve in her back which was causing the pain. Mrs Taylor from Edinburgh, said: 'The pain was crippling. I was in floods of tears and it really was unbearable. 'Because I was three months pregnant I didn't want to take any painkillers apart from paracetamol so I had to struggle on through the pregnancy. 'I'd never had a baby before so I went with what the doctors said and hoped the pressure would be released when my baby was born.' Bally went into a coma for three days following the birth of her daughter in 2008. She was then told she had a placenta tumour that had spread . Mrs Taylor, pictured with Amara, said she felt like giving in following chemotherapy . Mrs Taylor, who met IT consultant Gary on a British Airways flight to Glasgow, was staying with her aunt in Leeds when the pains got so severe she could barely walk and was rushed to hospital. She said: 'Gary had been away in Europe and he walked through the door andstraight away he said 'you look terrible, you're going to hospital'. 'I was seven months pregnant and didn't have a clue what was happening to me and the doctors said they were going to perform an emergency caesarean. 'They also said they were going to concentrate on keeping me alive and not my baby and I just went into shock.' After the birth Bally went into a coma for three days and was finally united with baby Amara, who apart from weighing just three pounds, was safe and well. After extensive tests to discover what had gone wrong doctors diagnosed Choriocarcinoma of the placenta, a rare cancer that develops in the womb. This type of cancer affects one in 40,000 women and usually develops following a failed pregnancy. However, Mrs Taylor's condition was even rarer as it occurred during pregnancy. The cancer had also spread to her lungs and a tumour had developed around her spine, which was causing the severe back pains. Mrs Taylor managed to learn how to walk again with help from her husband Chris (left) She is set to run with the Olympic torch tomorrow . Happy family: Gary and Bally with Amara. Mrs Taylor has raised £5,000 for Cancer Research . Doctors told Bally that she needed an operation to remove the tumour but it would mean she would never walk again. Bally said: 'It was crushing. I'd just woken from a coma, had seen my baby for the first time and then was told that I needed an operation that would save my life but would also leave me paralysed. 'In the space of a year my life had turned upside down.' Surgeons at a specialist hospital in Manchester removed the tumour and Bally returned to Edinburgh with Gary and Amara to start a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to ensure that the cancer didn't return. Mrs Taylor said: 'The chemo was awful. I had long beautiful hair and I lost it all after the first session, I felt like giving in.' But after nearly two years of chemotherapy, physio operations and pure determination, Mrs Taylor incredibly learned to walk again and she was told the cancer is now in remission. Mrs Taylor said: 'I was determined not to give in. I fought hard and I had to learn to do everything all over again as well as raising my baby. 'The whole time I was ill I had my air-stewardess uniform on the back of my door to spur me on to get stronger. 'I just did it a bit at a time, moving my legs, then standing and moving on to walking normally again. 'It goes to show if you want something bad enough you will get it.

Friends and family members have been posting about their sorrow over the death of the 2-year-old son of Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson. Peterson did not know he was the father of the young boy until he was already in the hospital. The running back was away from training again on Wednesday as he presumably spends time with his grieving family. The boy, whose name has been revealed to be Tyrese Robert Doohen, was raised by his mother Ann 'Ashley' Doohen. Tragic: Friends and relatives are posting pictures of Tyrese 'Ty' Doheen who died on Friday . Parents: The boy was raised by his mother Ann 'Ashley' Doohen (left) in South Dakota and Adrian Peterson (right) did not even know that he was the boy's father until he took a paternity test several months ago . She reportedly lived with her boyfriend Joey Patterson and he now faces charges of aggravated assault and aggravated battery. Those charges will likely be increased to murder since the boy was taken off life support on Friday. Ms Doohen has posted photos of Tyrese, who friends and family members called Ty, and has received an outpouring of support. 'Ann I haven't stopped thinking of you. My heart just aches. I am praying for you and your family,' her friend Sarah Powell wrote underneath a photo of the boy as a newborn. Newborn: Ms Doohen posted this photo of Ty when he was first born, and friends have commented telling her that they are praying for her and keeping the 'angel' in their thoughts . Little guy: Ty, seen here watching football, lived with his mother and her boyfriend who has since been arrested and charged with aggravated battery though he may now face murder charges since the boy died . A number of her friends have posted more recent photos of the boy, where he is seen posing in sunglasses and watching football on television. In one, a relative of Ms Doohen's posted a picture of Ty and a group of children at what looks to be a zoo, but the animal isn't capturing Ty's attention as he looks away from the group and up at someone outside of the photo. 'Always looking for his mom,' Celeste Zimmerman wrote. Though he has changed dramatically between the time he was born and the more recent photos, he is always seen smiling and grinning. In mourning: Ms Doohen is the mother of Ty, and she was living with her boyfriend Joey Patterson . Sweet boy: A relative posted this photo of Ty who was 'always looking for his mom' Too short: The exact circumstances surrounding the boy's death are still unclear but are thought to be abuse . 'He really is an Angel. My heart goes out to u sweetie, I will continue to pray for the Lord to mend your broken heart. I'm still in shock,' Jeannette Ruffin wrote. Ms Ruffin appears to be a relative of Bobby Ruffin, who posted a rant on his Facebook page after Ty's death on Friday saying he was the person who raised the boy. Sports fan: Since news of Ty's death, it has become clear that Peterson had a number of unknown love children . 'So tired of this poor Adrian Peterson s**t. Let me blow all your minds,' Ruffin posted on his wall which was reported by TMZ. 'The boy who died was my son. Yes AP was the biological father but I raised him and he carried my name.

Wayne Kinvig repeatedly posed as a charity fundraiser collecting money for his 'sick little brother' to buy cannabis . A teenage career criminal has been jailed today after repeatedly posing as a charity fundraiser collecting sponsorship money to spend on cannabis. His targets – some as old as 77 – were so moved by his false sob stories, including one about his 'sick little brother' having cerebral palsy, that they donated their pension money to the 19-year-old. A court heard how Wayne Kinvig got a ‘buzz’ out of preying on people’s kindness on doorsteps in Burnley, Lancashire. Kinvig would knock on doors armed with an official-looking clipboard and a sponsor sheet attached. He even carried around charity details and information about Gift Aid. The teenager would also inflate the amounts donated on his fake sponsor forms from £1 or £2 to £5 so the next person would feel obliged to match it. On one occasion Kinvig struck on the way home from an appointment with probation officers at a Youth Offending Team which was trying to tackle his prolific life of crime. The teenager told one victim money was needed to pay for stem cell treatment and told the father of a disabled child he was raising money for the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. Today Kinvig started 18 weeks in jail after Burnley Magistrates Court heard how he had run three almost identical cons and has already got a ‘huge’ record for dishonesty. He started his criminal career in July 2009 and was locked up for eight months in January this year. He was recently released and was on a curfew which he had flouted 59 times at the time of the latest cons. Kinvig (pictured here on Facebook) starts 18 weeks in jail today after Burnley Magistrates Court heard how he repeatedly conned people - some as old as 77 - out of their money with a string of charity sob stories . The thefts were said to have given Kinvig a ‘buzz’ because it meant he could see the faces of the people he was about to con out of cash. The court heard how on October 17 Kinvig had been given his four-week curfew after owning up to four counts of fraud, carried out on October 5, 7 and 12. But within three weeks he breached it repeatedly by a total of 47 hours and was ‘back to his old tricks’, falsely claiming he needed money to send a sick child to America for treatment. Police said he had claimed to a number of shops in the town centre that the money he was collecting for the treatment of a blind child. Kinvig had carried around a sponsorship booklet in the name of Daniel Foster. The businesses he had targeted told officers Kinvig had posed as a fundraiser for the Bailey Foster Appeal. This is a legitimate charity, which, raised around £40,000 between 2011 and 2012, for a three-year-old, from Ince, who was born with the rare condition septo-optic dysplasiam. Last year, Bailey flew to China with his parents for stem cell treatment. Kinvig started his criminal career in July 2009 and was locked up for eight months in January this year . Kinvig was caught after he went into Burnley library to use a computer to make bogus sponsor forms. Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting, said Kinvig produced a membership card at the counter but was challenged and was found to be registered under another name. Officers spoke to several people who signed the bogus form. One victim said he had been in his local pub when Kinvig approached him and said a sick child needed treatment in America. A woman contacted gave a similar account. Kinvig, of Westgate, Burnley, admitted possessing an article for use in fraud on November 4, obstructing police on November 6 and fraud by false representation between October 28 and November 4, in Lancashire. The teenager also pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the curfew and theft of underwear worth £2.99, from B and M Bargains. In mitigation, defence lawyer Philip Turner said his client had been in care until he was 18, there had been no parental guidance and little or no support from any outside agency since he came out of local authority care. The solicitor added: ‘He had no money and was living at a place where he’s barely welcome. What he has done is resorted to his old tricks. ‘He has been going in public houses or businesses and targeting people who are robust enough to go out drinking or be in work and none of them say that he comes on heavy with them.’ Kinvig was caught after he went into Burnley library to use a computer to make bogus sponsor forms .

Over the past three years, viewers  of Downton Abbey have become familiar with the lavish entertainment and formal etiquette of glamorous high society functions. But this year’s Christmas special will venture into even more rarefied circles, The Mail on Sunday can reveal, with a storyline that features royalty for the first time. The plot, which producers had hoped to keep a closely guarded secret, will revolve around Lady Rose’s debutante ball, when she will be presented to King George V and his wife Queen Mary at Buckingham Palace. Write caption here . But despite being unveiled as one of society’s most eligible young ladies before a host of wealthy bachelors, the moment is likely to prove bittersweet for Rose, who is already in love with jazz singer Jack Ross, the show’s first black character. Millions are expected to tune in to ITV’s Christmas Day episode, which show insiders claim is the ‘most spectacular, ambitious and glamorous’ yet, due to the elaborate sets which needed to look ‘fit for royalty’. The scenes were masterminded by show creator Lord Fellowes alongside historical adviser Alastair Bruce - who also makes a cameo appearance as the Lord Chamberlain. Lord Fellowes said the storyline was inspired by his own memories of the balls. ‘We thought it would be a fun story to tell,’ he said. Royal Performance: Lady Rose, played by Lily James (pictured), will attend a debutante ball and be presented to King George . ‘We all know that Mary, Edith and Sybil have been through this process, but we felt that many of the audience won’t know what the process is, and why should they? 'Girls were  presented twice - first as a debutante, then as a bride. In the evening you got dressed up in specific costumes. ‘Tiaras would not be worn by unmarried girls, but they would wear three ostrich feathers and a veil which descended on to a train. ‘The girls would sit in The Mall in a line of cars and people would gather and practically give them marks out of ten. 'I can remember friends of my mother’s would use our house to get changed, and the girls would come down the stairs in their floating, bouncy skirts, and ravishing picture hats. I was only about six but I still remember how lovely they looked.’ Last year’s Christmas special caused a sensation with the death of Matthew Crawley, with some fans even complaining that the shock plot twist ‘ruined’ their Christmas Day. But some may be disappointed that this year’s festive special will again not be set at Christmas, instead taking place in spring. Lady Rose, played by Lily James, will be escorted to the ball by her aunt, Lady Grantham.

Despite most trade with Iran being illegal, the U.S. sent nearly $2million dollars worth of bull semen to the Persian nation in 2012. In April 2013 alone, the U.S. sent $820,000 according to U.S. Census information gathered by Quartz. International cattle driving: The U.S. sent nearly $2million worth of bovine sperm to Iran last year. Above, a bull on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts . Altogether the U.S. sent $45.7million in humanitarian aid to Iran last April. While the number seems like a lot, it's nothing compared to the $26.2billion sent to our biggest trading partner - Canada. Bovine sperm side-steps the usual rules against trade between the two nations since it qualifies as humanitarian aid. 1. Rice - $18.6million . 2. Lentils - $10.33million . 3.

Battery parts - $40,000 . 16. Nickel alloys - $30,000 . 17. Chemicals - $20,000 . 18. Others - $20,000 . It's not the most exported item to Iran, but it's still in the top 10. Foods like rice, lentils, chickpeas and butter top the list. In addition to sending food, the U.S. sends products to help Iran make their own, like vegetable and fruit seeds, fertilizer and animal feed. The bovine semen is one part of that effort, helping to sire more cows as beef production has become an important issue in Iran. The country has made it a goal to be . self-sufficient in all types of meat production by 2016, and they plan . on investing the equivalent of $735million U.S. dollars into the . industry over the next three years according to Global Meat News. 'Currently, . despite the great potential in the field of animal production and the . creation of a number of agro-livestock farms, there are still many . challenges in the industry, and some livestock enterprises operate only . at 20 to 30 per cent of their production capacity,' said Cyrus Rusta, . head of the Central Association of Animal Breeders. They're . certainly not far off from self-sufficiency. In 2012, they produced . 970,000 tons of meat, which satisfied the demand for 90 per cent of the . Iranian population. But Iran isn't the only country after America's bull semen. The U.S. is the number one exporter of the product in the world, since many farmers want to breed high milk-yielding American cows. American cows have become the most efficient milk producing bovines in the world - making 21,697 pounds of milk in 2012. Of course this has to do with advances in agricultural technology, but its also due to breakthroughs in breeding. American farmers have the ability to predict how much milk an offspring will make based on data fathered from the parents which helps in choosing which cows to mate with specific bulls.","Strict trade sanctions have been in place between the U.S. and Iran since the Carter administration .

The European Parliament is set to scrap its second headquarters in Strasbourg in order to stop the monthly 'travelling circus' between France and Brussels. The move, warranted by the four-day sessions in Strasbourg every month costs 200 million euros a year. With continent-wide recessions and economic struggle, EU leaders are looking to put and end to the vast cost of having two parliamentary bases and use Brussels, the EU's main seat, as the sole headquarters. The European Parliament is set to scrap its second headquarters in Strasbourg, pictured, in order to save up to 215 million euros per year in travel an maintenance . The move would not only save hundreds of millions in travel but also an additional 12 million spent on maintenance for the Strasbourg building which is empty for 300 days of the year. However France is expected to veto the decision when it is taken before national leaders in an attempt to maintain its position as a 'founding state'. As it stands, EU law says that the parliament, the only elected body among the EU's institutions and one of increasing clout, must have a four-day session once a month in Strasbourg. That entails 766 members and their staff moving 430 kilometres (270 miles) from Belgium to the eastern French city, which is actually closer to Munich than to Brussels. Reams of parliamentary documents must also be shifted and a large number of reporters and lobbyists also have to tag along. Expensive circus: Each month the entire European Parliament moved from Brussels to Strasbourg, pictured, for four-day sessions before moving back again - incurring hundreds of millions in costs per year . The monthly move is estimated to cost . between 156 million and 204 million euros ($275 million) a year, but . also has an environmental impact that Green MEPs and many others find . unacceptable at a time of heightened climate awareness. Roughly 2,400 parliament staff also work in Luxembourg. Since the European Union's Lisbon treaty came into force in 2009 - giving the European Parliament new powers - a growing number of MEPs have campaigned against the costly set-up, with the most vocal opponent Britain's Edward McMillan-Scott. ‘Over 75 percent of lawmakers want to end the costly and inefficient monthly, four-day trek to Strasbourg from our home in the political capital of the European Union,’ said McMillan-Scott, a British Liberal Democrat. France, however, has defended its right to host the assembly and all the business it brings. In the latest of several rulings in France's favour, the European Court of Justice last year annulled a European Parliament decision to reduce the number of sessions in Strasbourg, saying it is for EU governments to decide changes. EU governments must all agree on granting a single seat to the parliament, effectively giving France a veto on any campaign seeking to put an end to the two-seat arrangement. Lawmakers still hope to garner enough public support to eventually pressure France to give in, building on a 2006 petition that was endorsed by more than 1 million EU citizens. EU lawmakers argue the parliament has undergone a transformation since it was created as an assembly in 1952, moving from a consultative body without the power to propose legislation to a house representing a 28-nation bloc of 500 million and co-legislating with governments. ‘The travelling circus between difference workplaces leads to unjustifiable costs and environmental damage that can no longer be explained to the public,’ Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) said in a statement.","European Parliament have a four-day session once a month in Strasbourg .

"By . Reuters . PUBLISHED: . 02:09 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:44 EST, 2 December 2013 . Heavy discounting took a toll on U.S. retail sales during the Thanksgiving weekend as shoppers spent almost 3 percent less than they did a year earlier, according to data released Sunday by an industry group. That could be an indication of a more difficult season ahead for many retailers. One bright spot this weekend, according to the data, was e-commerce, as online sales soared. The National Retail Federation estimated the average shopper spent $407.02 over the weekend, or 3.9 percent less than during the same weekend last year, because of lower prices it said would persist through the rest of the season. 'Retailers will continue to aggressively promote their in-store and online offerings, looking to entice today's very budget-conscious and value-focused shopper,' said NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay. The NRF said 141 million people went shopping at least once during the holiday weekend, up from 139 million last year. But total spending was expected to reach $57.4 billion for the four-day period - which includes Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year - down 2.8 percent from $59.1 billion over the same weekend in 2012. Where is everyone? Retail figures say sales are down almost 3 per cent this year compared with 2012. It seems many are choosing to avoid stores, such as Macy's flagship in Herald Square (pictured on Black Friday) and go online, with e-commerce up 17.3 per cent . The big deals will also dent profit margins, analysts said. 'Sales will go up, but gross margins are going to be down. Doorbusters were what people were shopping for, more than the regular-priced stuff,' said Ron Friedman, retail practice leader at the consulting firm Marcum LLP. The Thanksgiving weekend is an early gauge of consumer mood and intentions in a season that generates about 30 percent of sales and nearly 40 percent of profit for retailers. But many have given modest forecasts for the quarter. Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it expects no growth in its U.S. comparable sales, and Macy's Inc didn't raise its full-year sales forecast despite strong numbers last quarter. The shorter holiday period this year - there are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared with 2012 - prompted retailers to begin offering bargains on Monday, earlier than usual, something Shay said likely pulled some sales forward to the first part of the week. The NRF stuck to its forecast for retail sales to rise 3.9 percent for the whole season. Dramatic discounts are being blamed for the drop in sales figures this year . Chad Hastings, the general manager of Town East Mall in Mesquite, Texas, near Dallas, said shoppers were even more focused this year on specials, noting a higher correlation between the timing of doorbusters and the rise in shopper traffic at his mall over the weekend. 'Retailers are doing whatever they can to get that wallet share earlier,' Hastings said. Town East Mall's anchor tenants include J.C. Penney, Macy's and Sears. ComScore Inc, an analytics firm, said U.S. online sales rose 17.3 percent on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, outpacing sales growth at brick-and-mortar stores. ComScore has forecast a 16 percent jump in online sales for the season, helped by greater use of mobile devices. People stand outside a Prada store on 5th Ave during Black Friday Sales in New York November 29, 2013. Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving Day holiday, has traditionally been the busiest shopping day in the United States . The most visited e-commerce sites in order were those of Amazon.com Inc, eBay Inc, Walmart, Best Buy Co Inc and Target Corp, comScore said. Retailers are also being aggressive online as they look to benefit from Cyber Monday, which falls on December 2 this year. Cyber Monday is the biggest sales day of the year for e-commerce. J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's were among retailers that had already begun their 'Cyber Monday' sales on Sunday, looking to keep the momentum going. Target was calling the occasion 'Cyber Week'. Black Friday shoppers carry away discounted items from a Best Buy on Thanksgiving Day in Naples, Florida . The NRF predicted 131 million Americans would shop online on Cyber Monday, compared with 129 million last year. RetailNext, an analytics firm, found overall shopper traffic between Wednesday and Friday fell 5.2 percent and that customers went to fewer different stores, doing more online research beforehand. But shoppers spent more money in the stores they did go to, and Shelley Kohan, vice president, retail consulting at RetailNext, said that a website good enough to make shoppers want to visit a store is more crucial now than ever. 'Shoppers have more options,' Kohan said.","In-store shopping down by 3 per cent over Thanksgiving weekend .

A top university has been criticised by students for spending £1.4m on famous artwork while raking in £9,000 tuition fees and paying staff less than the living wage. Durham University spent the money while kitting out their new £50m Palatine Centre with works by Picasso and Andy Warhol. The building, which opened in October last year, now features a collection of work by 20th Century greats and pieces by north-east artists. Durham University has been criticised for spending £1.4m on artwork. Pictured is The Sphere of Redemption (centre) and Crystal Forms (left) at the university . However, the decision to spend the money on the university's new building has been criticised, with the students' union calling the spending a 'total disgrace', while trade union Unison said it was 'appalling'. Archie Dallas, president of Durham Students' Union, said: 'I cannot believe that the university thinks it is appropriate to blow that much money on art. 'Art is crucial. But this amount of money could be spent on student facilities, bursaries or, in fact, almost anything more worthwhile. In short, it is a total disgrace.' Durham University has said developing its collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was an 'essential' ingredient of the concept for the Palatine Centre, which houses key student services and the University’s headquarters. The spokesman said: 'Durham University is a custodian of many fine treasures and developing our collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was an essential part of the original concept for the Palatine Centre. 'Some of the artwork was specially commissioned and reflects the university’s academic strengths and the heritage of our region. The Palatine Centre (pictured), which opened in October last year, now features a collection of work by 20th Century greats and pieces by North East artists . 'The works that can now be viewed in the Centre, in the adjacent Law School and nearby public spaces represent a rich and varied presentation of 20th and 21st century art. 'The university organises free guided tours of the collection and staff, students and members of the public are encouraged to come and enjoy it. 'The Palatine Centre was part of the . wider £60m Gateway Programme, funded through a mixture of capital grants . from the Higher Education Funding Council, university reserves, . property disposals and bank borrowing. '£294k was provided within the original project budget under the “per cent for art” scheme; the balance was funded from savings in the capital programme as a whole.' Durham University student newspaper Palatinate fought to obtain figures as to how much the artwork costs after university chiefs hailed the quality of the art on display, but no costs were disclosed. Its Freedom of Information (FOI) request was initially refused for 'security reasons', as University officials claimed they were worried that announcing the value of the works would increase the risk of them being stolen. In April last year, thieves broke into the university's Oriental Museum and stole Chinese artefacts worth about £2m. An internal review found the FOI refusal was overly cautious. Because there was strong public interest in knowing how public money was spent, the decision was overturned. The university said £294,000 was originally budgeted for art but the 'marvellous spaces' at the Palatine Centre led to a decision to buy more artworks. Durham University has said developing its collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was 'an essential part of the original concept for the Palatine Centre' (pictured is Durham Cathedral Square and part of the university) John McDade, of the Unison union, said the university had 555 staff earning less than the living wage of £7.45 an hour. He said: 'It is appalling that Durham University blatantly refuses to treat their lowest paid employees with some dignity... but are able and willing to spend a fortune on works of art.' The university said the average hourly rate of its lowest paid staff was above the living wage once overtime, shift allowances and other supplements were taken into account. The university said most of the art was freely accessible during normal opening hours and that all the items can be seen during free weekly tours.","Durham University spent the money kitting out new £50m Palatine Centre .

Boys are 14 per cent more likely to be born prematurely than girls, according to new figures, which show an extra 5,700 boys are born early each year in the UK. Data for 2012 reveals there were 34,400 boys born under 37 weeks in the UK, compared to 28,700 girls. Boys are also more likely to suffer death and disability as a result of being born too early, according to the new analysis. Boys are 14 per cent more likely to be born prematurely than girls, according to new figures, which show an extra 5,700 boys are born early each year in the UK . Professor Joy Lawn, a neonatologist and epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), led the study. She said: ‘Baby boys have a higher likelihood of infections, jaundice, birth complications, and congenital conditions but the biggest risk for baby boys is due to pre-term birth. ‘For two babies born at the same degree of prematurity, a boy will have a higher risk of death and disability compared to a girl. ‘Even in the womb, girls mature more rapidly than boys, which provides an advantage because the lungs and other organs are more developed. ‘One partial explanation for more pre-term births among boys is that women pregnant with a boy are more likely to have placental problems, pre-eclampsia, and high blood pressure - all associated with pre-term births.’ Professor Lawn said boys had a biological predisposition to being born early. Data for 2012 reveals there were 34,400 boys born under 37 weeks in the UK, compared to 28,700 girls . ‘In the UK, an extra 6,000 boys or so are born pre-term each year,’ she said. The studies found higher rates of disability in boys across a range of health problems, including cerebral palsy, blindness and visual impairment. ‘If you are born premature, even that little difference in maturity between girls and boys can make a big difference – particularly in breathing complications for boys,’ Professor Lawn said. Professor Lawn’s research was a global study on premature birth, which she said was a major problem around the world. The figures showed the rate of premature birth remained largely unchanged in the UK at 7.8 per cent, compared to around five per cent in Scandinavian countries and 12 per cent in the U.S. There are 1,300 deaths due to complications from premature birth each year in the UK, mostly among babies born under 28 weeks. Professor Lawn said both younger mothers and older mothers had a higher risk of premature birth, with older mothers experiencing higher rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and medical complications. IVF also had an impact, increasing the number of multiple births, which were more likely to be premature. Globally, the studies published in the journal Paediatric Research, showed that of the 15.1 million babies born too soon, one million died due to prematurity. Of the survivors, 345,000 - 2.7 per cent - had moderate or severe disability. In some countries, where girls receive less nutrition and medical care, girls were more likely to die than boys, despite this biological survival advantage for girls.","In the UK, 5,700 more boys than girls are born early each year .

Police found a ‘shocking amount of child pornography’ in the home of an Iowa doctor who was arrested for sexually abusing a five-year-old girl when she told her mom that he 'tortures' her. Dr Dennis Seaborn Jones, 68, of Council Bluffs, who has been a pediatrician for 19 years - and has been used in the past as an expert witness in child molestation court cases, giving him access to photographs related to those crimes - was arrested in May after a parent filed a complaint against him. The complaint came after the child told a parent that she no longer wanted to see Jones because of the ‘torture’ he inflicted. Court documents say further . interviews indicated the child was the subject of inappropriate touching . while watching movies at Jones' home, according to ABC7. During . the execution of a search warrant at his Skyline Drive home, . authorities found large amounts of child porn on at least one computer, . and several more digital items were confiscated. Scene of the crime: The doctor allegedly touched the girl at his home in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Prosecutors say a 'shocking amount of pornography' was found in his home . That evidence will be allowed to be admitted in court when the case against Jones goes to trial in January. Late last week, District Court Judge Richard Davidson denied a motion by Jones and his attorney, Mike Winter, to suppress evidence obtained during a search of the doctor's home in May as part of an investigation related to sexual abuse charges against the doctor. ‘A shocking amount,’ wrote Denise . Timmins, prosecutor for the Iowa Attorney General's Office, which is . trying the case because Jones has been an expert witness in the past for . the Pottawattamie County Attorney's Office, according to Omaha.com. Defense attorneys Winter and Angela . Campbell, had argued that authorities lacked probable cause in executing . a search warrant issued for Jones' Skyline Drive home, three vehicles . and Jones himself. Suspended: Jones was put on immediate suspension by Methodist Physicians Clinic-Council officials, where he worked as a pediatrician . Expert witness: Jones has been used in the past as an expert witness in child molestation and child porn court cases, giving him access to photographs related to those crimes . However, the Attorney General's Office argued that a suspect alleged to have sexually abused a child has a propensity to possess child pornography. During the search of Jones' home, authorities seized two desktop computers and eight hard drives, including at least five external hard drives. It's unclear how many pornography files were seized or the nature of the pornography. At the time of his arrest in May, Winter said the doctor was ‘devastated’ by the charges. ‘He is innocent and he intends to defend himself to the fullest,’ Winter said. Jones, who worked as a pediatrician at Methodist Physicians Clinic-Council Bluffs, was suspended immediately after his arrest. Jones is charged with second-degree sexual abuse, a Class B felony, and faces up to 50 years in jail. His trial is set to begin in early 2014.","Dr Dennis Jones, 68, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, who has been a pediatrician for 19 years was arrested in May after a parent filed a complaint against him .

One of Britain's most iconic skyscrapers could be outstripped by a £1 billion tower - just 23ft taller. A 75-storey residential block is planned within spitting distance of London's One Canada Square, better known as the Canary Wharf tower - which was Britain's tallest building for 20 years. It will be the highest residential building in western Europe, holding more than 700 luxury apartments with breathtaking views over the capital. The 75-storey skyscraper, left, will be called Hertsmere Tower and rise 23ft above the iconic Canary Wharf . Irish property magnate Tom Ryan is behind the plans after his firm Ryan Corporation (UK) bought the east London site for £100m. It already has planning permission for the tower but the scheme was put under review during the recession. Mr Ryan is set to enter talks with Tower Hamlets council to change the tower from a mix of offices, homes and a hotel to an exclusive housing-only block whose 714 apartments will cost a staggering £1,600 per square foot. Its name will change from Columbus Tower to Hertsmere Tower and it could be finished in 2018. Chief Operating Officer Richard Berridge said: 'We're at a moment in time when . residential is something that is very popular in London and we came . across a project which we thought was incredibly exciting and in an area . where we think has a lot of growth.' An old design for the skyscraper when its name was Columbus Tower. Permission has already been granted . The tower will still be more than 200ft shorter than the Shard, the tallest skyscraper in western Europe . The 794ft tower is the latest in a stream of luxury developments in the capital. One of the newest is the 594-ft St George Wharf Tower in Vauxhall, south London, which made headlines when a helicopter crashed into the crane used to build it, killing two people. London's clay foundations make it unable to compete with countries like the United Arab Emirates - which has eight of the world's 10 tallest residential-only skyscrapers. 1. Princess Tower - Dubai, United Arab Emirates (1,356ft) 2. 23 Marina - Dubai (1,289ft) 3. Elite Residence - Dubai (1,248ft) 4. The Torch - Dubai (1,105ft) 5.

The Heron Tower in the City of London, near St Paul's Cathedral, is the capital's third-tallest and has apartments selling for more than £4 million. Homes in the ultra-luxurious One Hyde Park development were reportedly selling for more than £20 million when it was finished in 2009 - but there were claims that many of them were empty. But the rush of developments has prompted estate agents Savills to warn that London, which has an affordable housing crisis and sky-high rents, could soon have too many luxury homes. A huge proportion are not bought by British residents - instead falling into the hands of foreign billionaires. One high-end estate agent, London Property Partners, revealed earlier this year that 85% of its buyers were from overseas. Savills . director of residential research Susan Emmett told the Financial Times . this week: 'Since the recession developers have moved upmarket, . targeting buyers who are cash-rich, so we have seen a disproportionate . amount of building at the top end. 'A . lot of the buyers are foreign investors looking to rent it out and we . are questioning whether there is the level of demand for rental . properties at that price level. 'Some of that stock justifies the price but we are worried that not all of it will'. The Canary Wharf tower was the tallest building in Britain for 20 years after its completion in 1990.

Transformed: Mayra Rosales, who has lost over 800lbs, has told how she is fighting for custody of her sister's three surviving children . The woman dubbed the 'half-ton killer', after falsely confessing to killing her two-year-old nephew, is fighting for custody of her jailed sister's three surviving children after shedding an incredible 800lbs. Marya Rosales, 33, who once weighed around 1,100lbs, told police she accidentally killed her sister Jaime's son Eliseo by rolling on top of him while babysitting five years ago. But investigators found she was too heavy to have committed the crime and at her 2008 murder trial in Texas they proved she was actually covering for her sister who had who beat her son to death with a hairbrush. Rosales, who was barely able to move and had to be cut out of her home and carried to a removal van by ten men, admitted her sister had begged her to cover for her. Although she knew it was wrong, she said she felt she had already 'given up on life' and effectively had nothing to lose by pleading guilty to the crime, ABC reports. After she was cleared of the killing, her sister Jaime Rosales went on the run but was eventually persuaded to return to Texas where she pleaded guilty to causing injury to a child and was sentenced to 15 years in jail. In a documentary special 'Half-Ton Killer: Transformed', to be aired on TLC tomorrow night, Rosales tells how she is now hoping to be granted custody of Jaime's three other children. She said the children, currently living with their grandmother, call her 'mom' and were the imspiration behind her incredible weight loss. She said: 'They were first to know when I was able to stand up for the first time, and then when they saw me walking, they saw me walk in the door, they were very excited. They are my motivation.' Rosales, who has shed around four fifths of her body weight also reveals why she stuck to the story that she had killed Eliseo, even after being charged with murder. She said: 'I tried to protect my sister, and I was already dying so I didn't see ... like I was doing [something] wrong. Scroll down for videos . Too fat to kill: Rosales, pictured weighing around 1,100lbs, claimed she had accidentally killed her nephew, but investigators found she would have been incapable of the crime . 'I was already giving up in life, and the way I saw it, when they began saying I was going to get capital murder charges, I really saw it like they were doing me a favor.' 'I knew I was not doing right, but I was willing to give up my life for her.' Rosales was found innocent after doctors revealed Eliseo could only have died from a blow to the head - which could not have been struck by Rosales because she was too big to lift her arm. In 2008, shortly before Eliseo was murdered, Mayra and her husband Bernie had moved in with her sister Jaime in Sullivan City, Texas. Jaime had agreed to be a full-time carer when Mayra became so large she struggled to walk. However despite the fact that Mayra was almost entirely bed-ridden, Jaime would often go out, leaving Mayra in charge of her four children. 'I was more of a mother than Jaime,' Mayra has previously said. In March 2008, Mayra witnessed her sister hit Eliseo Jr. ‘Jaime was giving my nephew breakfast and he didn’t want to eat,’ Mayra said. ‘I told her if he was crying he wasn’t going to eat, but she got mad, got a brush and hit him on his arms, legs and head which left a bump.' Dramatic: Rosales has lost significant weight from her 1,100lb frame since she was acquitted of murder in 2008 after undergoing a series of surgeries . Killer: Mayra Rosales said she still . loved her sister Jaime (left) despite the fact she beat her son Eliseo . (right) to death with a hairbrush after he misbehaved . Later that day, Eliseo Jr began suffering breathing problems and Mayra called an ambulance. Jaime . phoned her sister from the hospital, sobbing that police would not let . her see her son unless she told them who had hurt him. Jaime . begged Mayra to tell the authorities she was responsible for the . injuries. In a move she would come to bitterly regret, Mayra accepted. Rosales said she did so to help her sister so that she would not lose her other children. ‘I . told the investigators that I rolled over to the edge of my bed to . where Junior was and my hand slipped and I fell on him with my hand. I . fell. I was the one to blame. But only by accident,' she explained. When her two-year-old nephew later died, Mayra Rosales was arrested and charged with capital murder. Manpower: It took ten men to remove Mayra in a removal truck from her sister's home in 2008 . At . her trial, the court heard that the fatal injuries sustained by the boy . were consistent with a blow to the head and could not have been caused . by someone falling on him. 'It . would have required her to have to swing her arm to strike the child on . the head but she could never move her arm in that manner,’ said Mayra’s . lawyer Sergio Valdez. ‘We knew that her size was her best defence . because she couldn’t move her arm.' Years of treatment: Mayra Rosales posted this image on her Facebook after undergoing weight loss surgery earlier this month . Despite the physical impossibility of . Mayra committing such a crime, the authorities had to conduct a full . trial, with Mayra as chief suspect. Months . went by before a courtroom was found that was large enough to . accommodate Mayra, and doors and walls had to be removed to fit her in. The . stress of the case caused Mayra's health to deteriorate to the point . that she had to be admitted to a hospital for the super-obese. When a regular ambulance was too small to transport her, a removal truck had to be used. ‘I began retaining more water in my legs and they got so hard,’ she said. ‘The skin is so stretched out that it hurts. It feels like my legs are going to pop like a balloon. 'Sometimes the sores open up and water oozes out. I wondered if we should amputate.' She added: 'Sometimes I got mad. I tried not to show it that much because I didn’t want anyone feeling bad for me. 'It was like I was in prison, with chains holding me there so I couldn’t move.’ Rosales admits she despised the nickname and told how aftter she had cleared her name she underwent surgery six times to remove tumors and excess skin. She had to lose 600 pounds before she was safely able to undergo gastric bypass surgery. She added:  'I think it's a miracle of God that I'm healthy. 'I'm alive, and I'm not diabetic. I do not have cholesterol [problems]. I don't have high blood pressure, so I'm healthy.'","Marya Rosales, 33, from Texas, has shed over 800lbs to weight 200lbs .

Emma Cadywould was struggling to cope after giving birth to baby Harrison, and was woken sometimes as much as 20 times a night, an inquest heard . The wife of an army major who was killed by a speeding train was suffering from 'one of the worst cases of post-natal depression' a coroner had ever seen, he told an inquest into her death. New mother Emma Cadywould had battled the condition for six months before she drove to a railway line where she was hit by a train. Mrs Cadywould, known to friends as Emsie, was struggling to cope after giving birth to baby Harrison, who woke her up through the night, the court heard. Despite support from family, including husband Steve, and from friends, she regularly told loved ones she wanted to be at peace and expressed suicidal thoughts, it was said. She was prescribed anti-depressants to cope with the strain, which had also taken a physical toll, as she started to lose her hair. Swindon Coroners' Court heard that on December 16, 2011, she left from her home in Watchfield, next to the UK Defence Academy, on the Oxfordshire-Wiltshire border. Mrs Cadywould drove four miles towards Swindon, Wiltshire, where she parked near the village of South Marston and made her way onto the main railway linking London with the West Country. Shortly afterwards she was struck by a train.  The driver had been partially blinded by the sun, and thinking he might have hit a deer, he continued to Swindon station. The damage to the train led to a investigation further back down the tracks, it was said. Major Cadywould told the hearing how he and his wife had been 'rapidly ejected' from Swindon’s Great Western Hospital following Harrison’s birth. 'We left after four hours. It was made clear to us at the beginning that they have a quick turnaround,' he said. 'I think it was quite a shock - the whole process.' He added: 'As time elapsed Harrison was difficult to get into a routine. 'The whole night from day, day from night, feeding. There was no routine. She found that very difficult with broken sleep. 'He was a very fretful baby. He would wake 10 to 20 times in the night. Sometimes there would be 20 minutes between his waking.' Mrs Cadywould had 'one of the worst cases of post-natal depression' a coroner had ever seen, he told an inquest . Both took it in turns to look after Harrison but his father began to take further responsibility when Mrs Cadywould couldn’t cope. 'There was a sudden change,' he said. 'The first time the crisis team arrived and Emma went to stay with her parents. 'I then went to take over full-time responsibility of Harrison. I think it had come to a point she could no longer cope. 'Physically she was okay, but mentally she wasn’t coping. She suffered some hair loss late on.' The couple were married in December 2007 and Harrison was born on June 1, 2011. The Major told the court he had breakfast with his wife and she dressed their baby and later drove him to nursery. They had discussed 'normal domestic' issues, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Despite support from family, including husband Steve (pictured), and from friends, she regularly told loved ones she wanted to be at peace and expressed suicidal thoughts, it was said . Major Cadywould, who had been taking military commander exams in the days, said: 'I believe she took care to conceal it [her suicidal thoughts] from me. 'She didn’t even tell me about the way she was feeling so I was unaware she had those thoughts. 'She didn’t talk to me about thinking about harming herself.' The University of Bristol researcher for the department of East Asian studies later died at about 10.30am that day. Train driver Christopher Woodley was at the controls of the cab of the train from London Paddington to Bristol Temple Meads when he heard a 'loud bang'. Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic) Feeling 'low' after having a baby, also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND). It usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite severe. Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to . cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby. They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel . hopeless about the future. Many of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and to be less severe. Treatments for PND include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered for short-term use. Some women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Practical and emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an antidepressant. Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 Monday-Friday 10am-2pm. Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401. Other telephone helplines available 24 hours a day include Parentline on 0808 800 2222 or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90. Source: Mind.co.uk .

A revealing new book about John F Kennedy's final year with his wife Jackie details with explicit detail the fateful day the president was shot on November 22, 1963.Christopher Anderson writes in These Few Precious Days that President Kennedy and his wife Jackie had finally found true love together in a marriage marred by infidelities after the death of their infant son Patrick three months before Kennedy's assassination.That day, as the President and First Lady traveled in procession through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, Jackie Kennedy watched her husband's face as he was fatally shot by a sniper. Scroll down for video . The number of people who believe that the shooting of JFK was due to a conspiracy has dropped 16 percent in the past ten years . Unaware: The couple at Love Field in Dallas, Texas less than an hour before Kennedy was assassinated. Jackie Kennedy would always remember the blood-soaked rose petals strewn after the shooting . His expression would haunt her for the rest of her life. 'He looked puzzled,' she later said. 'I remember he looked as if he just had a slight headache.' Anderson writes that she watched while, as if in slow motion, her husband's head began to come apart. 'I could see a piece of his skull coming off,' she recalled. 'It was flesh-colored, not white. I can see this perfectly clean piece detaching itself from his head. Then he slumped in my lap.' The world watched as a stricken Jackie Kennedy crawled over the trunk of the Lincoln the couple were traveling in and reached out. To many, it appeared she was trying to reach out to a Secret Service agent. In fact, she was grasping for a large piece of her husband's skull and brain that had landed on the car's hood. True love: Anderson writes that the President and First Lady had become closer than ever in their final year of marriage after losing their infant son Patrick . Sound impulses recorded on the microphone of a Dallas police officer amounted to evidence of a shot from the infamous 'grassy knoll' in Dealey Plaza, and thus of an additional gunman besides Oswald firing from a building window . She was pushed back into the car, where she cradled her stricken husband's head with her gloved hands, pressing them to his skull 'to keep the brains in,' she said later. Anderson writes that Jackie Kennedy whispered, 'Jack, Jack, Jack! Can you hear me?' His blue eyes were wide open and fixed. 'I love you, Jack,' she said. 'I love you.' The President still had a faint pulse when he was admitted to Parkland Hospital. As doctors began administering a massive blood transfusion, Jackie Kennedy, in her blood-and-gore-soaked Chanel suit, handed doctors what she had been cupping in her hands since the shooting: the piece of her husband's brain. The doctors tried to force Jackie Kennedy to leave as they worked on her husband, but she refused. 'I will not leave,' she said. 'It’s my husband. His blood, his brains, are all over me.' Acting on instinct: Jacqueline Kennedy would later say she had no memory of crawling onto the Lincoln's trunk to retrieve parts of her husband's skull . Motorcade: Morley does not suggest the Joannides files point to agency involvement in the assassination itself, but more likely that their release would show the CIA trying to keep secret its own flawed performance before the assassination . When doctors informed Mrs Kennedy that her husband had died, she was unable to speak, simply mouthing, 'I know.' Medical staff watched as Jackie Kennedy tenderly kissed her husband's white foot, sticking out from beneath the sheet doctors had covered him with. She pulled the sheet back to expose her husband's face and shoulders. Anderson writes that Jackie Kennedy later said 'his mouth was so beautiful.' 'Jackie then began kissing Jack again—starting with his exposed foot and then, through the sheet, slowly, deliberately, working her way up,' writes Anderson. She kissed her husband's foot, then his leg, thigh, chest and finally his lips. According to a doctor, it was the most moving thing any of those who were present had ever seen. Friends later reported that Jackie Kennedy, usually so spotless, refused to take off her blood-soaked suit, 'as though she didn't want the day to end.'","Author Christopher Anderson writes that the Kennedys' marriage had become stronger than ever in the final year of his life .

A teenager who caught meningitis at a California university last month has had both his legs amputated as school officials confirm a fourth person has been diagnosed. Lacrosse player Aaron Loy, 18, from Carlsbad, had the lower part of both legs amputated after a blood infection caused severe complications from the bacterial disease. He picked up the disease at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in November along with three others, who have not been named. Amputated: Aaron Loy, 18, left, pictured with his sister, had the lower part of both legs amputated after a blood infection caused severe complications when he was infected with meningitis last month . Outbreak: Loy and three other undergraduates became ill within a three-week time period in November. Loy, pictured here carrying his father, Ken Loy, on his shoulders, was the only one who had his legs amputated . The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and UCSB said the four undergraduates became ill of the Meningococcal disease - infection caused by the bacteria known as Neisseria meningitidis - within a three-week time period. This comes just weeks after seven cases of meningitis occurred on Princeton University's college campus in New Jersey. UCSB released a statement saying it has provided preventive antibiotics to more than 500 students who were identified as close contacts of the initial three ill students, according to CBS8. Close contacts of the fourth case have also been identified and have received antibiotics. The students will be directed to get the antibiotics at UCSB no later than Tuesday and will be directed to take the medication onsite. Almost died: The lacrosse player, shown left with a teammate, picked up the disease at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), right, in November along with three others, who have not been named. The disease almost killed him but doctors managed to save his life . Meningitis is the inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord and may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs. The most common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe headaches and neck stiffness. Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious; however, neither is as contagious as the common cold or flu. Even students who have been given preventive antibiotics can become ill depending on the timing of exposure; preventive antibiotics only offer protection for about one day, so students can become ill if exposed to the bacteria again in the future. Supportive: Loy's parents, pictured, are documenting their son's progress on a website, Caring Bridge. They say his 'competitive spirit will help him recover' The university has suspended some of their social events on campus, including parties sponsored by fraternities and sororities, in ‘an effort to interrupt transmission of the outbreak strain in social networks’. ‘These actions are initiated with the goal of protecting health and preventing additional cases of meningococcal disease. They are important and compliance is greatly appreciated,’ said the university and the health department in a joint statement. In the meantime, Loy is still recovering at UCSD Medical Center and having to get used to the fact that his legs are gone. His parents are documenting their son's progress on a website, Caring Bridge. They say their son’s ‘competitive spirit will help him recover’ but said ‘his journey ahead is lengthy’. Two funds have been set up for Aaron and his family to help with mounting medical bills. There are approximately 2,600 cases of bacterial meningitis per year in the United States, and on average 333,000 cases in developing countries. The case fatality rate ranges between 10 and 20 per cent. Meningitis is the inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord and may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs. It can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord. The most common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe headaches and neck stiffness.

But she was given medication and told to go home, according to NBC News. On the third visit, hospital staff again tried to send her home but she miscarried and the fetus was delivered feet-first in a painful and prolonged breech delivery. 'Each time I went into the hospital, the same thing happened,' Means told NBC through an ACLU spokeswoman. 'They should act like it's their mother or sister or daughter they're treating. I pray to God someone stops this from happening again. My life could have been taken. I was in a very dangerous situation.'

Public figure: James Maze was incorrectly identified in an obituary and now he has spent days reassuring friends that he is alive and well . An Alabama man had the rare chance to read his own obituary over the weekend when his local paper mistakenly reported that he had died. James Maze, 66, was alive and well when his landline and cell phone started ringing off the hook on Saturday with concerned friends calling after seeing his picture and obituary in the local paper. 'It was a good friend of mine who said ""Are you alright? I said ""Sure I'm alright!""' Mr Maze told MailOnline. The next call was from his wife who . was at work and had received an angry call from a friend who was mad . that they hadn't been told of her husband's passing. ‘I said I need to go get a paper and see what this is all about,’ Mr Maze said.

Parents in a Los Angeles suburb have teamed up with Erin Brockovich after at least 10 area children have been diagnosed with brain tumors. Mary and Patrick Leyden's son Patrick died five years after being diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 19. After his death, they began hearing about other families whose children were also battling malignant and benign brain tumors. Speaking out: Mary and Patrick Leyden's son Patrick (pictured) died after a five year battle with a brain tumor that he was diagnosed with when he was 19 years old . Scary trend: Patrick is just one of at least 10 people who grew up in Moorpark, California and were diagnosed with brain tumors . 'I just collected names, numbers and addresses and they kind of were in the same proximity, even though Moorpark’s a small town,' Mary Leyden told CBS Los Angeles. The Leydens were joined at the CBS interview by two other parents of teens who were fighting the same disease- and who had all lived in the same area of California. One of which was Tom Pflaumer, whose daughter Breanna was diagnised with a fatal brain tumor at the age of 14. Doctors told her that she would only live for three months, but she has since undergone 12 surgeries and is now 22-years-old. Voice of experience: Erin Brockovich has made her career helping families fight against environmental causes of disease and now she is pushing for answers in the Moorpark case . Banding together: Julie Miller (left), Tom Pflaumer (center) and Mary Leyden (right) are just three of the concerned parents whose children have either been diagnosed with or died from a brain tumor . 'I knew about three or four more . people in addition to Patrick (Leyden) and Austin (Munoz),' Mr Pflaumer . said, mentioning one of Breanna's friends who's brain tumor is now in . remission after extensive treatment. A number of the children in question attended Moorpark High School, the public school serving the area of 34,400 people. As much as the similar stories have given the parents a means of support through the difficult diagnoses, they are more concerned with stopping the problem and finding the source of the 'cancer cluster'. 'I don’t even know if (county officials) are aware of it, honestly,' said Mrs Leyden. Fighter: Doctors told Breanna Pflaumer that she would only live for three months after being diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 14 . Today: 12 surgeries later, Breanna is paralyzed on her left side but has not given up hope . After conferring, the families . contacted legal advocate Erin Brockvich, who became famous for building . the case against one of California's biggest gas companies after finding . them at fault for a similar cancer cluster. There . are no firm leads on any potential causes for the high number of brain . tumors in the area, but Brockovich says that further research into the . case will be helped by a national disease tracking database. Brockovich has been advocating for some form of federal website that would allow people across the U.S. to report when they are diagnosed with various cancers and brain tumors. Such a database would help experts have a collective source recording how many cases of certain diseases are reported in certain areas. No more football: Breanna's friend Austin Munoz was diagnosed with a similar brain tumor and although it is in remission, he has been barred from playing on the school football team . She testified about its merits in the Senate in 2011 but the bill pushing for the creation of such a site has been stalled. 'I think we need to get in the business of taking a look at a national reporting center, so we can begin to look at science, look at stats … help science help doctors, so doctors can help their patients, so we can have better health,' she told CBS Los Angeles. Cancer clusters which stem from environmental issues are spread across the country, including one recent case in the New York suburb of Briarcliff. In that case, at least a dozen children were infected- two of whom died- as it was discovered that the school sports field was filled with toxic chemical waste.","Families of teenagers from the same California high school are trying to find the cause of their children's brain tumors .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:18 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:03 EST, 3 December 2013 . Google has been playing both sides of Washington's streets by making contributions to conservative political groups that have left-wingers seeing red, it emerged today. But the company is largely just looking out for itself. The tech giant's grantees include Heritage Action for America, a tea party-oriented organization that some pundits regard as the main catalyst for October's partial government shutdown. Another is Americans for Tax Reform, led by conservative anti-tax crusader – and liberal nemesis – Grover Norquist. The left-wing Center for Media and Democracy claims that although Google is 'supposedly guided by its ""don't be evil"" motto,' the normally reliably left-wing company has been 'funding a growing list of groups advancing the agenda of the Koch brothers.' That's a reference to David and Charles Koch, the billionaire scourges of liberals, who have contributed nearly $220 million to conservative and libertarian groups. Google co-founder Sergey Brin isn't engaged in a secret plot to help Republicans . Google has put millions into efforts to support an 'open' Internet, pushing for so-called Network Neutrality laws designed to keep Internet service providers from picking winners and losers in the public sphere . But it appears that Google's support for Republican-linked groups may not actually involve money changing hands. The Cato institute, the best-known libertarian group with national reach, told MailOnline that the company pays only for limited Google ad buys. 'They basically donate free advertising,' said Cato communications vice president Khristine Brookes. 'It amounts to $40,000 per month,' she said in an email. 'We use the grant to buy text ads on the Google search network, promoting our research papers, blog posts, and op-eds, and have found that the ad buys are helpful in driving traffic to our site.' The anti-tax Norquist wouldn't tell MailOnline if his group's support from Google was aimed at advocating for lower taxes on businesses – like Google. But Americans for Tax Reform, he said, 'fights to reduce the 35 percent tax on American businesses – higher than the European average of 25 percent – and urges the U.S. to move to a territorial tax system used by most nations in the world,' Norquist said. 'The only disappointment is that some companies are not yet supporting ATR's efforts to restore American competitiveness.' Territorial systems levy taxes on domestic income, but not foreign income. Google and other companies essentially pay double when they earn income in other countries, since both those countries and the U.S. tax those dollars. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist's group likely caught Google's eye because the company doesn't like paying U.S. taxes on money it earns overseas . Is David Koch, one of the famed right-wing Koch brothers, secretly working with Google? Not likely. It's raining money: President Obama's re-election campaign took in more than $801,000 from Google employees last year, indicating that the company's rank-and-file is behind the Democratic White House . Heritage Action declined to answer questions about the nature of Google's support. 'We don’t discuss donors,' said the group's communications director, Dan Holler. A Google spokeswoman declined to provide a Washington Post blogger with details about its support for the organization. Heritage Action is credited with pitting conservatives against moderate Republicans in September, forcing disagreement about how to counter the Obamacare law – and ultimately leading to the shutdown in October. Google says in on an online transparency report that its political action committee and philanthropic efforts are mainly oriented toward supporting an 'open Internet,' free from over-regulation and 'controlled by no single organization, individual, or government.' Despite the surprising dalliances with the political right documented in the transparency report, the company has spread its money to both the right and left for years. Statistics compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show that Google donated more to Republican congressional candidates than to Democrats during the 2012 election cycle, and is repeating that pattern for 2014. But Google's employees gave more than $801,000 last year to president Obama's re-election campaign, and another $622,000 to the Democratic National Committee. The Center for Media and Democracy . called its findings 'surprising, given Google's public reputation on . purportedly progressive issues other than privacy.'","A liberal group spun Google's .

Filin had grabbed Zarutsky's hand after he splashed the acid, but the . assailant broke free and fled. Maximova . said testimony showed that Dmitrichenko had offered Zarutsky 50,000 . roubles ($1,500) to give Filin a beating, and had tipped him off by . telephone that Filin was on his way home. Dmitrichenko, . who joined the Bolshoi as a teenager in 2002 and made his name playing . villains such as the murderous tsar in the ballet 'Ivan the Terrible', . has acknowledged he wanted Filin roughed up but said he had not expected . acid to be used. Career over: Sergei Filin starring in Gisellle in 2000.  It remains unclear how many of his former duties Filin will resume at the Bolshoi after his formal return to the building in Moscow's centre in September . Zarutsky, who pleaded guilty, has said it was his own idea to use acid, and that he did not tell Dmitrichenko of his plan. The . prosecution said in court that Dmitrichenko had been motivated by a . conflict with Filin. Prominent former dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze told . the court that Filin had denied roles to both Dmitrichenko and his . girlfriend, a ballerina. The case marks one of the worst crises at the Bolshoi Theatre since its foundation in 1776. The . imposing colonnaded building housing its main stage, a stone's throw . from Red Square and the Kremlin, only reopened last year after a long . renovation dogged by accusations of waste and corruption. The trial exposed a company riven by feuds and rivalries. In . a courtroom confrontation, Filin said Dmitrichenko had spread false . allegations that he had played favourites and had love affairs with . ballerinas. But defence . witnesses portrayed Filin as an imperious hothead and Dmitrichenko as a . champion of others in the company who feared to speak out against the . artistic director, wary of his power to make or break careers. The judge also pointed to testimony that said Dmitrichenko had accused Filin of favouritism in the distribution of grants. In . an effort to end the scandals, the Russian government dismissed the . theatre's longtime director Anatoly Iksanov in July, and the Bolshoi . declined to renew its contract with Tsiskaridze, who had feuded with . both Iksanov and Filin. Filin . returned to the Bolshoi in September after months of treatment in . Germany, but his sight remains impaired after more than 20 operations . and he wears dark glasses to shield his eyes.

A fitness-obsessed co-ed that became unable to sleep last year made a startling discovery during a routine medical exam. Christina Speirs, 22, of New York, exercised almost every single day, taught yoga and stayed in top shape. What she thought was a product of drinking too much water turned out to be a cancerous tumor growing inside her. The tumor was on her kidneys and forced her body to produce hormones that kept her awake almost continuously, she recalled to ABC News. She couldn't sleep: Christina Speirs didn't think being awake more was abnormal . ‘I had a lot of energy,’ Ms Speirs said. ‘I wasn't sleeping... I was always on the go, I was never tired.’ Ms Speirs thought the high amounts of water she was drinking caused her to wake up often during the night, so she did nothing about it until a medical exam made a shocking discovery. Doctors discovered last fall that her blood pressure was high, ‘through the roof’ high, but her potassium levels were low – it stumped them. ‘That really freaked me out because them not knowing what's wrong with me, they're doctors, you know?’ Said Ms Speirs. After ruling out a heart condition, doctors checked her kidneys at the urging of her mother. The sonogram stumped doctors as well, it appeared she had one combined kidney, throwing the co-ed into further panic as she was whisked to an MRI. Horrified: Ms Speirs was shocked when doctors told her she had a large tumor inside her . The sonogram technician asked if she felt anything, Ms Speirs replied she felt fine. The MRI showed she had two kidneys, but instead she horrifyingly had a tumor almost the size of a grapefruit growing inside her. ‘I was in complete shock,’ Ms Speirs recalled to ABC, saying she called her parents because she needed surgery. ‘Then, I got so upset honestly. I had no idea where this came from.’ She also soon learned the tumor was producing the hormones aldosterone and cortisol – which led doctors to fear it was cancerous. Her surgery was scheduled at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York for October 31, 2012 – Halloween night. Better now: Ms Speirs is cancer-free and able to sleep . As if having her surgery on the same night ghouls and ghosts run amok wasn’t bad enough, Superstorm Sandy unleashed it’s wrath on the city only two days prior. The hospital was overcrowded and short-staffed, but her medical team was determined to save her life. The 22-year-old was in the hospital during the storm, unaware of the damage it caused to the city, but was wheeled past several people displaced by the worst storm in the city’s history. ‘I was just kind of a little teary,’ she remembered. Doctors removed the tumor, stage 2 cancer. Described as adrenal cortical carcinoma, the tumor was growing on her liver – it affects one in several hundred thousand people, Ms Speirs’ doctor told ABC. Ms Speirs awoke after the surgery with no electricity because of the storm, but that mattered little to her. ‘I was just happy to be alive,’ she said. She is now cancer-free, but takes medication to stay that way. One of the side effects of the medication happens to be drowsiness – she can’t do hot yoga anymore, but now she can sleep.","Christina Speirs thought her inability to sleep was a result of high energy from always working out .

From polar bears lurking in icy waters, to crowns made of baby crocodiles, the winners of Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2013 captured nature at its most surprising. But this year's over-all winner is a South African photographer who got up close and personal with African elephants to capture the moment they congregated around a still body of water that caught their reflections, while one of the baby mammals ran past. A 14-year-old photographer won Young Wildlife Photographer of the year 2013 for his image of gharial crocodiles that sees a mother croc wearing her brood on her head, which looks a little like a crown made of crocodiles. Essence of elephants: South African photographer Greg du Toit beat almost 43,000 entries from 96 countries to be crowned this year's winner with his enigmatic portrait of African elephants in the Northern Tuli Game reserve in Botswana. The image was taken from a hide at ground-level using a slow shutter speed to create an atmosphere and show the giant animals in a ghostly way . Mother's little headful: Udayan Rao Pawar's image shows gharial crocodiles on the banks of the Chambal River in Madhya Pradesh, India - an area increasingly under threat from illegal sand mining and fishing. The hatchlings swam onto a female's head, presumably because they felt safe there, said the young photographer . The winners of the competition were announced at a gala held at the Natural History Museum, where the photographs will go on show to the public from October 18. South African photographer Greg du Toit beat almost 43,000 entries from 96 countries to be crowned this year's winner with his enigmatic portrait of African elephants in the Northern Tuli Game reserve in Botswana. Called essence of elephants, the image was takn from a hide at ground-level using a slow shutter speed to create an atmosphere and show the giant animals in a ghostly way. Mr du Toit used a wide-angle lens tilted up to emphasise the size of whatever . elephant entered the foreground and chose a narrow aperture to create a . large depth of field so that any elephants in the background would also . be in focus, as well as using a polarising filter. Snow moment: Jasper Doest photographed the famous Japanese macaques around the hot springs of Jigokudani and was fascinated by the surreal effects created by the arrival of a cold wind. Occasionally, a blast would blow through the steam rising off the pools and if it was snowing, the result would be a mesmerising pattern of swirling steam and snowflakes, which would whirl around any macaques warming up in the pools. He waited in the snow until an adult appeared and jumped on a rock in the middle of the pool. 'When I started shaking off the snow, I knew this was the moment,' he said . The fact that most images of polar bears show them on ice says more about the practical difficulties faced by humans than it does about the bears' behaviour. Mr Souders took his boat to Hudson Bay, Canada and spotted this bear 30 miles offshore. 'I approached her very slowly and then drifted. It was a cat-and-mouse game. I could hear her slow breathing as she watched me below the surface or the exhalation as she surfaced, increasingly curious. It was very special,' he said. The midnight sun was filtered through smoke from forest fires raging farther south, a symptom of the warming Arctic . However, while considerable skill was required to create the final picture, the photographer got lucky when a baby elephant raced past the hide so close that he could ahve touched her, allowing Mr du Toit to capture the movement seen in the final picture. Ever since he first picked up a camera, Mr du Toit has photographed African . elephants. He said: ‘For many years I’ve wanted to create an image . that captures their special energy and the state of consciousness that I . sense when I’m with them. This image comes closest to doing that.’ 'My goal was to throw caution to the wind; to abandon conventional photographic practices in . an attempt to capture a unique elephant portrait. This image hints at . the special energy I feel when I am with elephants,' he added. Mr du Toit's photo will take centre stage at the forthcoming exhibition that celebrates the rich array of life on . our planet, reflecting its beauty and also highlighting its fragility. After its London premiere, the exhibition embarks on a UK and . international tour, to be enjoyed by millions of people across the . world. The cauldron: Sergey Gorshko's photograph is the only one not to contain an animal. On November 29 2012 heard that Plosky Tolbachnik - one of the two volcanoes in the Tolbachnik volcanic plateau in Russia - had begun to erupt. He boarded a helicopter to get a photograph of the event and despite hot air buffeting the helicopter, Mr Gorshko strapped himself to the open door of the aircraft and kept taking photographs . Dive buddy: The beaches of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico are traditional nesting sites for the endangered green turtle, which attract tourists. 'The turtles are so used to seeing people in the water that they think we're just part of the environment,' said Mr Sandoval. 'This metre-long female, grazing on seagrass, took no notice of me, apart from glancing up briefly' Chair of the judging panel, accomplished wildlife photographer Jim Brandenburg said: 'Greg’s image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures – it is truly a once in a lifetime shot.' Fourteen-year-old photographer Udayan Rao Pawar has also been recognised as Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2013 for his image called Mother’s little headful. It shows an arresting scene of gharial crocodiles on the banks of the Chambal River in Madhya Pradesh, India - an area increasingly under threat from illegal sand mining and fishing. To take the photograph, Mr Pawar camped . near a nesting colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River – . two groups of them, each with more than 100 hatchlings. The spat: Brazil's Pantanal was the setting for a jaguar fight. A male appeared and approached a female, who was lying in what appeared to be a pose of enticement but she rose, growled and suddenly charged, slamming the male back as he reared up to avoid her outstretched claws. The pair then disappeared into the undergrowth to resume their courtship . Sticky situation: In May, the seafaring lesser noddies head for land to breed. Their arrival on the tiny island of Cousine in the Seychelles coincides with peak web size for the red-legged golden orb-web spiders. The female spiders, which can grow to the size of a hand, create colossal webs up to 1.5 metres in diameter in which the tiny males gather that can catch passing birds. Noddies regularly fly into the webs. This bird was exhausted, said Mr Pretorius said freed the bird to save it from its fate . Before daybreak, he crept down and hid behind rocks beside the babies. ‘I could hear them making little grunting sounds,’ he said. ‘Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe.’ It turned out that she was the chief female of the group, looking after all the hatchlings. Gharials were once found in rivers all over the Indian subcontinent but today just 200 or so breeding adults remain in just two per cent of the former range. Mr Pawar said: ‘The Chambal River is the gharial’s last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing.’ Other finalists captured a variety of animals from fighting jaguars and a to a monkey in Japan shaking snow from its coat to create a flurry of flakes. They also got involved in the shots including interacting with a turtle underwater, freeing a bird from a sticky spiderweb and even risking life and limb to capture a volcanic eruption. Lucky pounce: Mr Stefanison spotted this fox in Yellostone National Park, USA. It quartered the grassland, back and forth, and then started staring intently at a patch of ground, giving the photographer just enough warning of the action to come. When it sprung up, Connor got his shot. And when it landed, the fox got his mouse . Sergey Gorshko's photograph is the only one not to contain an animal. On November 29 2012 he received a phone call he had been waiting for to tell him that Plosky Tolbachnik - one of the two volcanoes in the Tolbachnik volcanic plateau in Russia - had begun to erupt. 'I've gone to the area many times, but it had been 36 years since the last eruption, so I dropped everything and went,' he said. He had to take a helicopter in temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius and flew towards the cloud of ash, smoke and steam to wait until a strong wind parted the clouds and he had a fleeting glimpse of the crater. In these moments he could see a 200-metre high fountain of lava and fast-flowing molten rivers of lave running down the volcano, sweeping away all nature in their path. Despite hot air buffeting the helicopter, Mr Gorshko strapped himself to the open door of the aircraft and kept taking photographs. 'I just kept shooting, changing lenses and camera angles, knowing I had one chance, hoping that I'd take one image that might do justice to what I was witnessing,' he said. The flight path: This female barred owl had a territory in Burnaby, British Columbia. Mr Stefanison watched her for some time, familiarising himself with her flight paths until he knew her well enough to set up the shot. He set up his camera and put a dead mouse on a platform above the camera and waited for the swoop. 'She grabbed the mouse, flew back to her perch and began calling to her mate. It is one of the most exciting calls to hear in the wild,' he said .","A South .

The Government has misunderstood the ways in which paedophiles target their victims and is wrong to focus on tackling online child abuse, according to the former head of the UK's internet child protection agency. Jim Gamble has claimed that Prime Minister David Cameron's attack on Google when he called for firms to block images of child abuse was because the internet giant is not paying enough tax in the UK. He claimed that there is a 'fundamental lack of understanding' about paedophiles and called for a new approach to tackling abuse. Outspoken: Jim Gamble, former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, has criticised the Government for misunderstanding how paedophiles target their victims . Mr Gamble, who resigned as boss of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Service three years ago, suggested that the Government should expand the use of lie detector tests on people arrested for downloading child pornography to see if they have carried out further offences. His comments came amid concerns of the relatively low success rates in identifying serial offenders. 'Wrong': Prime Minister David Cameron singled out Google when calling for search engines to do more to stop images of child abuse . Convicted paedophiles will be given a . lie detector test as standard when they are released from prison to help . assess the risk whether they still pose any risk. But Mr Gamble says that the Government have missed an opportunity to invest on further research into paedophilia. According to The Independent, he told a conference in Belfast that the debate was too focused on Google and search terms rather than paedophilia itself. 'The advice to the Prime minister is bad from people who clearly don't understand the first thing about the internet and child protection. 'We are now focusing on Google rather than investing in greater research: why they do it, when they do it. Why? Google don't pay enough tax.' Mr Cameron was criticised by industry experts in July when he called for search engines to introduce a pop-up warning if people enter search phrases such as 'child porn'. Internet firms said that the move would not stop people sharing images. Downing Street said that targeting online search engines is just one way to tackle the issue of child abuse.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:14 EST, 3 December 2013 . The Air Force is using a secret network of informants to crack down on drug-taking and sexual offences, claims one former cadet who says he was recruited to spy on colleagues before being unfairly expelled when an operation went wrong. Eric Thomas, 24, says that during his time as a snitch at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, he provided information which resulted in 15 drug convictions and two sexual assault convictions. But he says his handlers hung him out to dry after he got into a fight with a cadet he had been tasked with tailing and was expelled just a few months before his graduation. Spies in their midst: The Air Force has a secret network of informants . among cadets at their California Springs Academy to crack down on drug . use and sexual assaults . Thomas claims he was recruited by the Air Force's Office of Special investigations (OSI), which uses FBI-style tactics to operate dozens of informants among the academy's 4,400 cadets. He told the Colorado Springs Gazette: 'It was like a spy movie. I worked on dozens of cases, did a lot of good, and when it all hit the fan, they didn’t know me anymore.' The newspaper conducted a lengthy investigation and has produced an in-depth report about the alleged use of informants at the base. They tracked down four cadets, claiming to have been informants, of which three agreed to speak. All of them said they had been told by the OSI that they were the only informant on campus. The Air Force academy is notorious for its strict system of rules and discipline which aims to strip incoming cadets of any sense of individuality and replace it with a collective Air Force identity. In the first months they are required to quick march around base and sit at attention during meals setting their forks down while they chew each mouthful a regulation seven times. Although strictly forbidden, parties do take place, often at houses rented specifically for the purpose by third parties. Drinking is said to be common place as is the smoking of marijuana and a synthetic marijuana known as Spice. Cadets are seen marching at the Colorado Springs base which is notorious for enforcing strict rules including the number of times a cadet should chew a mouthful of food . Thomas claims he was instructed to infiltrate these parties and report to his handlers about who was supplying and taking the drugs. He said in one incident he was called to a meeting by a handler known as 'Briana', actually a burly man with a beard and glasses named Special Agent Brandon Enos. He claims Enos produced a pack of cheap cigars and taught him how to roll a blunt - a marijuana joint which uses the skin of a cigar - and how to appear to smoke it without actually inhaling. Thomas, who said he came from a strict home and had never used drugs before recalled: 'The whole time I was like, ""OK, I’m getting told how to roll a blunt by a federal agent; this is a different cadet experience that is not in the brochure""'. In one oeration, the OSI told Thomas they wanted him to get close to a cadet naed Stephan Claxton, who had been reported sexually assaulted four female cadets but who couldn't be prosecuted because the cadets had reported him confidentially. Thomas went out drinking with Claxton and other cadets including a civilian woman who was engaged to a cadet at the academy. Although Thomas had not been given permission to leave the base that weekend, the OSI told him to break the rules. The subsequent court martial heard how the woman ended up getting drunk and passing out and the cadets took her back to the academy to find her fiancé. Claxton and Thomas took her to any empty dorm room where Claxton remained with her while others went to find her fiance. Thomas later discovered Claxton inisde the room with her shirt up and pants undone at which point a fight between him and Claxton and Thomas broke out. Claxton was charged with sexual misconduct and sentenced to six months behind bars. Thomas and five other cadets were punished for sneaking off base and having a female in the dorm. Thomas thought he would be protected by the OSI but he was stripped of his rank and restricted to base. Despite this the OSI continued to direct him to follow targets and buy drugs even if it meant breaking the rules and leaving the base. After the academy found out he was leaving despite his restrictions, commanders were outraged at his contempt for the rules. Just six weeks before he was due to graduate, having been accepted into pilot school, he was expelled. He has now moved back with his family in South Dakota and has launched an appeal for wrongful dismissal for which he is waiting for a response.","Air Force's Office of Special .

Frey, 11, and his nine-year-old brother Nate had been playing behind their family's house in Prescott, southwest Iowa on Saturday afternoon but failed to return home. Family members launched a search and discovered the boys' belongings near to a hole in the ice around 20 yards from shore. Their parents, Tom and Leisa Frey, immediately alerted authorities. Emergency crews, including a helicopter and dive team, arrived on the scene within minutes. Tragic: 11-year-old T.J. Frey, left, and his little brother Nate, right, have died after falling through ice on a pond . Creston Fire Department officials wearing ice suits entered the pond and found one of the boys right away, around one foot under water near to the hole, the Des Moines Register reported. They found the other body about 20 minutes later. Both of the boys were taken to hospital by helicopter, but they were pronounced dead. Authorities said they do not know what the boys - who were described as inseparable - were doing on the ice, but suspect they were simply playing. Heartbreaking scene: The large pond can be seen just south of the Frey's home in Prescott, Iowa . Explorers: They loved exploring the rural land, pictured, and are believed to have been playing on the pond . 'It was a beautiful day,' Corning Fire Chief and Adams County Emergency Management Director Donnie Willett said. 'They were out exploring.' Their parents have four of their own children and adopted a baby boy several years ago, friends told KCCI. They later adopted the baby's two brother - T.J. and Nate - to keep them together. 'It was a loving and supportive family,' John Walsh, the principal at St. Malachy School in Creston, where the boys were students. 'They had a good home. Lots of love.' Walsh added that the boys, who were always together, were good students. T.J. played the trumpet, Nate played the saxophone and their teachers said they were both good readers. Inseparable: Nate, left, and T.J. were best friends and went everywhere together, their teachers said . Loved: The two boys, pictured center, were adopted by the Freys (pictured left and right, back row) several years ago. The couple already had four children and adopted the boys and their baby brother . Grief counselors were at the school on Monday to speak with the boys' classmates. On Saturday temperatures reached 46 degrees, which was unusually warm, the Register reported. Iowa Department of Natural Resources officials added that ice is inherently unsafe. 'We never say there’s such a thing as safe ice, because ice thickness varies on bodies of water,' DNR spokesman Mick Klemesrud said. 'Never trust ice.' The boys will be remembered at a funeral service on Saturday at Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Creston.","T.J. and Nate Frey were playing behind their parents' house in Prescott, Iowa on Saturday but failed to come home .

Ashes to ashes: The cremated remains of either a human or animal were discovered inside the Jordan-Hare Stadium . A mess: The ashes were found Monday by Auburn officials cleaning the stadium, which was littered with thousands of orange pom-pom shakers and damaged by fans trampling the field on Saturday night . 'Grandma or grandma's dog:' Scott McElroy, associate professor for turfgrass and weed science at Auburn University said it was not known whether the remains were human or animal . ‘It could have been grandma or it could have been grandma's dog,’ said Scott McElroy, associate professor for turfgrass and weed science at Auburn University. McElroy saw the remains for the first time at 11 a.m. on Monday, according to al.com. Auburn officials say it is not the first time a fan has dumped the remains of a former family member on the field. ‘It happens a lot more than you think,’ McElroy said. ‘People want their final resting place to be Jordan-Hare Stadium.’ Cremated remains can quickly kill the grass and contaminate the soil, so the turf and grounds crew removed the grass and two to three inches of soil at the spot Monday. True fans: Bushes were damaged as fans charged the field after Saturday's win. It is not the first time a fan has dumped the remains of a former family member on the field . ‘People think this is the last resting place and I'm doing a good thing by putting out organic matter on the field, but it's actually quite detrimental to the grass,’ McElroy said. Auburn officials were busy Monday cleaning the stadium, which was littered with thousands of orange pom-pom shakers and discolored and damaged by the fans trampling in the field. Bushes along the sideline and the south end zone were damaged as fans charged the field, creating ‘cow trails’ among the broken branches, McElroy told al.com. Flower beds in the southeast corner were also destroyed, but that can be repaired by simply replanting the flowers. ‘There was some damage but no one was badly hurt as far as I know and it was a good celebration,’ McElroy said.","Cremated remains of either a human or animal were found inside the Jordan-Hare Stadium .

Fellow pilots told KTVU that they are hopeful the plane landed safely and is simply out of reach of cell phone coverage. 'We have no idea what the status of . things is right now,' Valley County Shieriff's Lt. Dan Smith said. 'They could have landed safely . somewhere and just can't communicate.' Where is it? Smith was flying with his family in this Beech Bonanza, a six-seat single engine plane . Authorities . would not confirm that Smith was flying the plane, but did say the . plane was registered in his name. He has owned it since at least 2008. Smith was taking his adult son to Montana following the Thanksgiving weekend. Investigators confirmed that the other missing people are from the Smith family, but did not elaborate. Rand Kriech, who co-founded a hardware and software company, SerialTek, with Smith, said his friend was an excellent pilot. 'He's one of the safest pilots I . know. A very cautious pilot,' Kriech told NBC. 'Have no fear of flying . with him at all. I'm a pilot myself and I really appreciate somebody . that takes as much care as Dale.'

'When . there was Hurricane Katrina, Dale was the first one to get in his . plane, grab a bunch of members of the church and go out and help,' friend Ann Dyreng told KGO. Smith obtained his pilot's license in 2005 and had a second-class medical certification, which allowed him to operate a commercial aircraft, the Associated Press reported.

While the display reveals the frightening collection of weapons taken into schools across London, many of the items are of a more light-hearted nature. Most of the weapons on display were taken from Emotional, Social and Behavioural Difficulties schools from across the city. From homemade playthings such as pen tubes used as pea shooters, toy guns and colourful plastic toys to jewellery, make-up, gadgets and improvised missiles, the confiscated list also offers a glimpse into how pupils distract themselves from studying while at school. Mr Tarrant said: 'The items on display have been held by the schools concerned for a long time and all pupils were given the opportunity to claim back their goods at specified times but chose not to do so.

When sleep deprived parents Refe and Susan Tuma decided to pose their children's toy dinosaurs to make it look like they were coming to life at night they sparked a family tradition and a global internet craze. The couple, from Kansas City, US, started Dinovember last year as a way to encourage Adeia, six, Alethea, five and Leif, two to sleep through the night. With the promise of seeing what the dinosaurs had been up to the next morning the children slept through the night, looking forward to their morning surprise. And after sharing their pictures on Facebook, parents all over the world are joining in by sharing their creative results. Refe and Susan's aim is to convince the children that their toys came to life while they were asleep. Here the pesky prehistorics are seen spraying graffiti all over the walls of the family's home . During the month of November the couple's children wake up to find the dinosaurs looking like they have caused new mayhem every morning. The mischief the dinosaurs have so far 'caused' includes, painting graffiti on the walls, unraveling the toilet paper in the bathroom and breaking eggs all over the family's kitchen floor. In one slightly darker scene, the dinosaurs appear to be torturing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figure, in an image reminiscent of gangster drama The Sopranos. Bathroom blast: The children awoke on this November morning to find that their plastic toys had made a gargantuan toilet paper mess in the bathroom . Perhaps these dinosaurs thought they would have Jurassic japes by smashing eggs all over the kitchen floor? Here the dinosaurs look like they were trying to make amends by cooking breakfast, but with disastrous results . This is the second year that the couple have staged Dinovember, which is now being enjoyed by their new baby Amarie too. They have used the children's own toys to create the scenes, some of which belonged to stay-at-home-mum and artist Susan when she was a child. Refe, 27, who works as a writer, said: 'It started when our son who was one at the time wasn't sleeping through the night. 'We were all tired through the day after being up all night and we found ourselves putting the kids in from of the TV and not engaging in the way we wanted to be with them. Even washing up is a Jurassic lark in the Tuma household, with these dinosaurs ready to lend a hand . The dinosaurs are clearly more refined than a prehistoric picnic, and look like they hosted a lovely late night tea party while the children are asleep . Smash and grab: The Tuma's young children no doubt had something to say when their toys raided the sweetie jar . 'One night Susan my wife put the dinosaurs in the bathroom sink to make it look like they were brushing their teeth. 'The next morning Adeia came running in and told us all about it and really believed it, it just carried on from there.' After sharing the idea with friends and family the couple decided to set up a Dinovember Facebook page, to share their idea with other users around the world. Even decking the halls ended in a a big mess when the dinosaurs 'decided to decorate at midnight' The group is already followed by more than 76,000 people many of whom have been inspired to make their own dinosaur scenes. Refe said: 'At first it was a way to show our family what we were doing for the kids and everybody loved it. They were talking about it for months afterwards. 'What we wanted to do with the Facebook page is show other parents that they could do something like it. 'Plastic dinosaurs are something every child has, but no one really ever thinks about it until something like this.'

Court battle: Judith Saunders, pictured outside the Court of Appeal, has spent five years trying to get her wedding ring from her ex-husband . A woman who was married for nearly 40 years spent five years fighting a legal battle with her ex-husband to recover her £550 wedding ring. Judith Saunders has forked out around £100,000 in legal fees fighting him over £7,000 worth of jewellery including the ring. She said she had supported her ‘unemployed’ husband, Trevor Unwin, when they met and had even bought their wedding rings. The 66-year-old retired teacher told the Court of Appeal that she mounted her legal battle to recover her 22-carat gold ring because she ‘paid for it and wanted it back’. The couple met in 1966 and married in 1970. They separated in 2004, and although they were briefly reconciled, they divorced in December 2007. During their marriage, Mr Unwin had a successful career as a businessman and amassed assets worth around £1.5million. Mrs Saunders said that in 2007, just before their divorce was finalised, they signed an agreement splitting their wealth. She received two Sussex properties worth £500,000 and the right to reclaim ‘jewellery’ from the former matrimonial home. But she claimed that her ex-husband was so determined not to hand over the ring and other pieces of jewellery that he ‘faked a stroke’ when she went to collect them in January 2008. The court heard that last year after a long legal battle, Mr Unwin handed over the wedding ring, which his ex-wife valued at £550. But her bid to secure the other three pieces of jewellery – a £4,000 pair of diamond and sapphire earrings, which she said she also paid for, another set of earrings and a designer pearl necklace – was dismissed by a family judge in November last year. Mr Unwin, who is also 66, denied having the items and was cleared of faking a stroke. In the Appeal Court, Mrs Saunders criticised the decision as ‘irrational, perverse and bizarre’. She said that once the ring was returned to her the judge dismissed her argument that she had been ‘denied access to the former matrimonial home and my jewellery’. Mrs Saunders, who has remarried and lives in Alicante, Spain, said: ‘It all turned on the wedding ring issue [and the fact] my ex-husband gave the ring back to me eventually. But that was just part of my jewellery claim.’ Lady Justice Gloster told Mrs Saunders: ‘I see force in some of the matters you raise.’ But, refusing to grant permission to appeal, she added: ‘I do not think she has enough ammunition (to) have a real prospect of up-ending the judge’s findings of fact.’ Dispute: Trevor Unwin separated from Mrs Saunders in 2004 after nearly four decades together . Urging Mrs Saunders to move on from . the dispute, she said: ‘I would be doing her no service by allowing this . appeal to proceed. You would be best to try to put it behind you.’ Outside . court, Mrs Saunders said it was a point of principle and not the . monetary value of the jewellery that had led to her court fight. ‘It . was a 22-carat gold band which I paid for – and I paid for his,’ she . said. ‘He was unemployed when we married; I was supporting us. I paid . for it and I wanted it back.’ Mr Unwin called Mrs Saunders a 'very, very bitter woman' Details of the case were revealed during a hearing at the Court of Appeal in London . Last . night Mr Unwin, a retired company director from Forest Row, East . Sussex, said: ‘She is a very, very bitter woman. I think she keeps . taking me to court because she is bored in Spain. ‘Mrs . Saunders cleared out our villa in Spain and packed the ring in a box, . which then sat in storage for years. I discovered it and took it to the . court, but she didn’t want it. I had to post it to her in the end.’ He denied that his ex-wife had bought the jewellery.","Judith Saunders bought her wedding ring when she married Trevor Unwin .

A learning supervisor who forged an 'obsessive' relationship with a teenager has been spared jail. Tracey Graham, 35, admitted harassing a child over a period of ten months, repeatedly ringing her and texting her inappropriate messages. Graham, of Alnwick, Northumberland, also made the child a CD of love songs and took her on a day trip to Edinburgh zoo. Newcastle Crown Court heard how Graham was working as a learning supervisor at a Northumberland School when the offence took place. In one message, Graham messaged the teenager saying: 'Goodnight beautiful princess, I love you so much, sweet dreams xx' Another text message read: 'You are the most important person in my life. Love you.' Prosecutor Gavin Doig said: 'The defendant had been calling her, messaging her and sending her cards. 'This shows the obsessive nature of the relationship that had developed. 'The victim said ""stop texting me please, will you delete my number. I have got all this built up and it’s beginning to make me feel sick. You are a caring person but this is past caring"". 'The defendant accepts holding the child’s hand and hugging her but said it went no further, it was not sexual.' Defence lawyer Ros Scott-Bell said: 'She can see what went wrong but at the time she was leaned upon by the child. 'Most of the people who know her speak of her desire to help. She volunteers and she goes out of her way to help and it appears that is what she did on this occasion. Graham accepted holding the child's hand and hugging her, but said their relationship went no further, the court heard . 'I accept she went totally over the top and smothered the relationship and she should have known better. 'But it was one that she closed her eyes to. It was one that was not sexually motivated and she failed to see the impact she was having on the young girl. It wasn’t set out from the start.' A statement from the victim read: 'She said she was my friend. She is the one that has hurt me most.' Judge Penny Moreland sentenced Graham to eight weeks imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. The judge also granted a five year restraining order banning her from contacting the girl. Judge Moreland told Graham: 'It is absolutely clear to me and should be clear to all listening to these remarks that you were not behaving from the best of intentions.

Two paedophiles who groomed boys as young as 13 online before meeting them and abusing them have been jailed for life. Anthony Marsh, 53, who is HIV-positive, and Lee Davis, 39, were told they were 'predatory, dangerous paedophiles' by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court today as he jailed them for what police described as 'vile, horrendous offences'. The pair, who are both married with children and live near Doncaster, used social networks like Facebook and Bebo as well as specialist gay websites to befriend boys before meeting them and sexually abusing them. Anthony Marsh, 53, left, who is HIV-positive, and Lee Davis, 39, were both jailed for life for child sex offences . Salesman Marsh, from Hatfield, near Doncaster, and unemployed Davis, from nearby Consibrough, admitted a string of sexual offences against children, starting in 2004 by which time Marsh had been diagnosed with HIV. The court heard of a series of . incidents in which the pair would take their victims to woods, or . Davis's van, or even the boys' own bedrooms when their parents were out. Davis and Marsh would used pseudonyms . on the web but did not pose as teenagers as they utilised a range of . social networking sites and communication sites including Skype and Grindr. The court also heard how Davis had a . secret 'dirty phone' and had sent and received more than 40,000 texts, . following up his internet activity. Judge Julian Goose QC heard how they were were both family men - Marsh a father of two and Davis a father of one - whose wives and children had no idea of what they were doing. He was told how they spent hours online grooming their victims, most of whom were young teenagers coming to terms with their sexuality. Sentencing the paedophiles at Sheffield Crown Court, the judge called them 'predatory and dangerous' The judge referred to their youngest known victim - a 13-year-old from Lancashire - who was initially abused by Marsh in his own bedroom at home and then, later, raped by Davis after Marsh had passed on his details. Davis recorded his abuse of the boy on a 45-minute long video tape which, the court was told, clearly showed the youngster in his bedroom, pleading with the defendant not to do what he is doing. Judge Goose heard that the boy was particularly vulnerable as he had recently come out as gay and had been self-harming and subjected to bullying which was so bad he had tried to set fire to his own bedroom. He said the burns from the incident were clearly visible on the film Davis made. 'Yet both of you groomed him and used him for sex,' the judge said.  'You, Davis, raped him. And videoed it.' Judge Goose said it was . 'truly shocking' that Marsh had unprotected sex with young, vulnerable . victims knowing his HIV-positive condition. 'Both of you groomed him and used him for sex.  You, Davis, raped him, and videoed it.' - Judge Julian Goose QC, of the pair's youngest victim, 13 . The court heard how the pair were caught after Marsh was arrested in May 2012 at a hotel in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, after he was spotted with indecent images of children. Police eventually found thousands of images in Marsh's possession, many of them showing the highest possible level of abuse, the court heard. Police found a library of films hidden in the cellar of Davis’s home showing him abusing the boys, and officers also established that Marsh distributed some footage over the web. The pair were sentenced after admitting conspiracy to commit . sexual activity with children, meeting a child following sexual grooming . and number of other sex offences - 55 charges in all - in September this year. Davis admitted . further charges relating to indecent images today. Marsh, who also used the names Tony . Taylor and Tony Smith, admitted sexual activity with a child and . possessing and distributing indecent images of children. Davis, whom Marsh knew as James Parkin . until after they were both arrested, admitted raping a 13-year-old boy, . sexual activity with a child and taking indecent photographs of a . child. Marsh's convictions involved seven boys; Davis' convictions involved six boys,and four of the teenagers concerned were abused by both defendants. Sentencing Marsh to life imprisonment with a mininum of 10 years before he is eligible for parole and David to life with a minimum of 12-and-a-half years in jail, the judge told the defendants: 'You are both predatory, dangerous paedophiles.' Speaking outside court, Detective . Inspector Delphine Waring, of South Yorkshire Police, said it was possible . more victims had not yet identified themselves and urged any people in . that position to come forward for help.","Anthony Marsh, 53, and Lee Davis, 39, admitted abusing young teenagers .

A gang of copper thieves who ‘colluded’ with crooked BT employees to steal quarter of a million pounds worth of underground cables have been jailed for a total of 32 and a half years. The thieves stole a telecoms van complete with overalls so they could pose as workers for the company and trawled London looking for redundant cabling which could be pulled up, stripped down and sold. In total the gang caused a £279,635 loss to BT in terms of stolen property and damage before the cables were seized at a scrapyard in Dagenham, Essex. Zeki Mehmed, 54, left, who had worked for BT for 30 years, was jailed for four and a half years while John Harding, 52, right, was sentenced to five years behind bars after the gang stole cabling worth around £280,000 . Simon Read, 40, and Ricky Read, 24, both of Chadwell Heath, Essex, posed as workmen as part of the plot . Simon Read, along with Jamie Summerscales, Jamie Ratford, Ryan Wiley, Kieron Madden, Ricky Read and Simeon Ramsey all posed as roadside workmen, wearing high visibility vests and setting up cordons and cones, when they carried out the thefts. The gang committed a large number of thefts over a six month period between April and early December 2012, operating at different times of the day and night. Prior to embarking on these expeditions the thieves received crucial tip-offs from BT employee Zeki Mehmed that enabled them to successfully target specific sites all over London and the Home Counties. Once stolen, the metal was transferred to another vehicle before being taken to an east London scrap yard where John Harding worked, who alongside Tommy Taylor, handled; valued and exchanged the metal for cash. Cables were stolen from sites across the capital including in Wood Street in Walthamstow, east London, and Oakley Road, Canonbury, Islington, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Tim Naylor, prosecuting, said: ‘This was an ongoing conspiracy to steal redundant cables from BT. ‘They stole from various locations in London which were to be deposited and stripped to be sold for huge profit. ‘This . was a criminal enterprise to steal metal cabling belonging to BT and . they used vans, uniforms and equipment to retrieve the cabling. Ryan Wiley, 26, left, and Jamie Summerscales, 40, right, were both jailed for three years and eight months . Jamie Ratford, left, and Keiron Madden, right, both 33, were also sentenced to three years and eight months after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal . ‘Everything . stolen was redundant cabling but this does not take from the fact it . was a sophisticated and well organised enterprise which caused huge . losses. ‘A BT cable van was . stolen and there were no signs of a forced entry which would suggest . they would have colluded with at least one BT employee to gain access.’ Mr . Naylor said gang members posed as roadside workmen, wearing high . visibility vests and setting up cordons and cones before thieving the . cable. They stole between one and three tonnes of BT cable each time they struck with each tonne worth a few thousand pounds. On December, 13, 2012, officers swooped on a scrap yard following a six-month long intelligence-led specialist operation designed to catch the key players red-handed as they followed their regular routine of exchanging tonnes of stolen cable for thousands of pounds in cash. Simeon Ramsey, 34, was jailed for eight months to run consecutively with another sentence he is currently serving for theft. Tommy Taylor, right, was ordered to carry out community service . Detectives also seized a stolen BT van packed with two tonnes of copper cable, worth thousands of pounds which was used by the gang on their regular expeditions to steal. Police said that the van had a detachable £50,000 winch to retrieve the cable from underground via manhole covers. Mehmed, 54, who had worked for BT for 30 years, was jailed for four and a half years for his role while another ringleader, John Harding, 52, was jailed for five years. Simon Read, 40, was given four years . while Summerscales, 40, Ricky Read, 24, Ratford, 33, Wiley, 26, and Madden, 33, were each jailed for three years and . eight months.

Read, Ricky Read and Madden, all of Chadwell Heath, Essex, . Summerscales, of West Ham, London, Ratford of Woolwich, London, Wiley, . of Hornchurch, and Ramsey, of Harlesden all pleaded guilty to conspiracy . to steal. The gang were sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London . Harding of Romford Essex, and Mehmed of Potters Bar, . Hertfordshire, were convicted of the same charge following a trial in . October. Tommy Taylor, 36, of Meadow Lane, Wickford, Essex, was handed a nine . month sentence suspended for 18 months and given 220 hours community . service after he was found guilty of conspiracy to steal. Acting Detective Superintendent Neil Thompson of the MPS London Crime Squad said: ‘This was a highly organised criminal network who threatened the very infrastructure of the country, putting the public at risk through their reckless disregard of the communications networks. ‘The offence was heightened by intelligence provided by a BT employee to the gang. The London Crime Squad has worked tirelessly alongside BT investigators to bring the offenders to justice.’ Kevin Brown, of BT security and corporate investigations, said: ‘BT will not tolerate any level of criminal behaviour. We will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police Service, assisting with their investigations to target organised crime, and do everything possible to catch cable theft criminals.’","Thieves stole a BT van complete with overalls and posed as workers .

Former SS hitman Heinrich Boere (pictured in 2009) has died in a prison hospital while serving a life sentence for the murders of three Dutch civilians during World War Two . A former SS hitman who escaped justice for six decades after murdering Dutch civilians during World War Two has died in a prison hospital while serving a life sentence at the age of 92. Heinrich Boere died of natural causes yesterday in the facility in Froendenberg, Germany, where he was being treated for dementia, a North Rhine-Westphalia Justice Ministry spokesman said. He had been the state's oldest prisoner. Boere was on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list of most-wanted Nazi war criminals until his arrest in Germany and conviction in 2010 on three counts of murder. During his six-month trial in Aachen, Boere admitted killing three civilians as a member of the Silbertanne - or Silver Fir - hit squad, a unit of largely Dutch SS volunteers responsible for reprisal killings of countrymen who were considered anti-Nazi. 'Late justice often sends a very powerful message regarding the importance of Nazi and Holocaust crimes,' the centre's top Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff, said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. 'It's a comforting thought to know that Boere ended his life in a prison hospital rather than as a free man.' Boere sat through his trial in a wheelchair and was regularly monitored by a doctor. He spoke little, but told the court in a written statement he had no choice but to obey orders to carry out the killings. 'As a simple soldier, I learned to carry out orders,' Boere testified. 'And I knew that if I didn't carry out my orders I would be breaking my oath and would be shot myself.' At his trial in 2010, Boere admitted killing three civilians as a member of the Silbertanne hit squad . But the presiding judge said there was no evidence Boere ever even tried to question his orders, and characterised the murders as hit-style slayings, with Boere and his accomplices dressed in civilian clothes and surprising their victims at their homes or places of work late at night or early in the morning. 'These were murders that could hardly be outdone in terms of baseness and cowardice - beyond the respectability of any soldier,' the judge said in his ruling. 'The victims had no real chance.' Boere remained unapologetic to the end for his actions, saying that he had been proud to volunteer for the SS, and that times were different then. Born to a Dutch father and German mother in Eschweiler, Germany - on the outskirts of Aachen - Boere moved to the Netherlands when he was an infant. Boere (pictuerd at his trial) was on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list of most-wanted Nazi war criminals until his arrest in Germany and conviction in 2010 on three counts of murder . In testimony during his trial, Boere said he remembered his mother waking him up the night in 1940 that Germany invaded the Netherlands and seeing Stuka dive-bombers overhead. Instead of fearing the German bombs, he said his family was elated as the attack unfolded. '(My mother) said `they're coming' now things will be better,' he told the court, before later adding: 'It was better.' After the Germans had overrun his hometown of Maastricht and the rest of the Netherlands, the 18-year-old Boere saw a recruiting poster for the Waffen SS, signed by Heinrich Himmler. It offered German citizenship after two years of service and the possibility of becoming a policeman after that. He showed up with 100 other Dutchmen at the recruitment office and was one of 15 chosen. 'I was very proud,' Boere told the court. After fighting on the Russian front, Boere ended up back in the Netherlands as part of the 'Silbertanne' hit squad. According to statements Boere made to Dutch authorities after the war, he and a fellow SS man were given a list of names slated for 'retaliatory measures.' Boere killed pharmacist Fritz Hubert Ernst Bicknese with a pistol in his pharmacy, then he and the accomplice killed bicycle-shop owner Teun de Groot when he answered the doorbell at his home. They forced the third victim, Franz Wilhelm Kusters, into their car, drove him to another town, stopped on the pretense of having a flat tire and shot him. 'Kusters fell against the garden door ... and sank to the ground,' Boere told investigators. 'Blood shot out of Kusters' neck.' After the war, Boere managed to escape the prisoner-of-war camp where he was being held in the Netherlands and eventually return to Germany. He was sentenced to death in the Netherlands in 1949 - later commuted to life imprisonment - but the case always seemed to fall through the legal cracks. The Netherlands sought Boere's extradition, but a German court in 1983 refused on the grounds that he might have German citizenship, and Germany at the time had no provision to extradite its own nationals. A state court in Aachen ruled in 2007 that Boere could legally serve his Dutch sentence in Germany, but an appeals court in Cologne overturned the ruling, calling the 1949 conviction invalid because Boere was not there to present a defense. It was after the appeals ruling that a prosecutor in Dortmund quietly reopened the case, beginning from scratch and charging Boere with the three murders in 2008. During his trial, Boere told the court he was aware of the possibility he would be pursued by authorities, so much so that he never married. 'I always had to consider that my past might catch up with me,' he said. 'I didn't want to inflict that upon a woman.'","Henrich Boere died of natural causes while being treated for dementia .

Crisis: A shortage of hospital beds and surgeons are to blame for the high number of cancelled operations, new figures reveal (stock photo) Around 170 NHS operations are cancelled every day at the last minute as hospitals struggle to cope with a lack of beds, staff and faulty equipment, new figures reveal. A total of 30,415 elective operations were shelved between April and September this year on the day patients were due to have surgery or scheduled to arrive in hospital - a 12-year high. Experts blame a chronic shortage of beds with NHS trusts unable to juggle planned operations and run overstretched Accident and Emergency departments. Meanwhile other factors blamed for the high cancellation rate include administrative errors, earlier operations over-running, and emergency surgeries taking priority. The average daily rate of cancellations is 169 - higher than the average daily rate for the same period in any year since 2001. The average daily cancellation figure for April - September last year was 151 and the year before that 142. One in five hospitals has bed occupancy rates of more than 95 per cent and a handful of trusts are running at full capacity - leaving them unable to cope with swelling emergency admissions. News of the cancellations comes as NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh claimed a two-tier A&E should be created to ease pressure on 'an emergency service at its limit'. John Lister, of pressure group Health Emergency, said: 'Vast number of hospitals have no capacity to take in a mix of emergency and elective cases.' 'Emergencies will always take priority so if you fill your hospitals up with emergency cases then elective cases are going to be bounced back. 'These numbers show that hospitals can’t cope with the combined caseload.' The six-month figure, released by NHS England, is the highest it has been since 2001 when the number of cancelled elective operations, also revealed in NHS figures, topped 41,000. But Mr Lister warned: 'The squeeze is going to continue to tighten as A&E caseloads continue to be high and, in some cases, running at winter-peak levels right throughout the year.' Last month a National Audit Office survey found that bed occupancy rates averaged nearly 90 per cent across NHS trusts in England. They found that a fifth of all trusts reported rates of more than 95 per cent between January and March 2013. The number of elective operations being cancelled is at the highest level for years (stock photo) Bar chart illustrating the number of cancelled operations in England's NHS hospitals in April-September each year . The worst performing health trusts for cancelled operations between April - September this year included Barts in East London, the University Hospitals of Leicester Trust, and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. Financially troubled Barts Health Trust in east London cancelled 649 elective operations between January and June, the most in England. Its chief executive Peter Morris previously said the trust - which covers St Bartholomew’s Hospital and the Royal London - was at risk of 'financial failure' amid reports it was losing £2 million a week. The University Hospitals of Leicester Trust, meanwhile, cancelled 441 elective surgeries and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust called off a further 296 operations. Both were labelled in ‘highest risk’ category for failing patients by the Care Quality Commission in October. St Bartholomew's Hospital in east London falls under Barts Health Trust, one of the worst for cancellations . The term ‘last minute’ is used by the NHS to describe cancellations on the same day surgery is scheduled or operations axed after a patient has arrived in hospital. As well as a chronic lack of beds, the NHS said operations were shelved because of staff shortages, faulty equipment, administrative errors and earlier scheduled operations over-running. The number of cancellations is usually higher in the winter, as numbers of A&E admissions rise further. An NHS England spokesman said: 'NHS England believes that cancellations should be avoided wherever possible as we recognise the concerns that patients face when this happens. 'Hospitals strive to use their beds as efficiently as possible, and at the same time need to respond to surges in demand when these occur. 'Such surges are usually due to an increase in the number of emergency admissions, and whilst health communities endeavour to plan for this, an above-expected rise in emergencies can lead to cancelled operations. 'This is not directly related to the performance of A&E Departments, but to the need to admit patients with sudden and severe illness and injury.' The spokesman added: 'An important aim of Sir Bruce Keogh's first stage review of urgent and emergency care is to reduce hospital admissions, where these can be safely avoided, and alleviate some of the pressure on hospital beds. 'Therefore, as the recommendations of the review are implemented over the next three to five years the chance that an operation will be cancelled at short notice, which is already very low, should reduce still further.'","Total 30,415 elective operations cancelled between April - September 2013 .

A topless model was exposed as a benefits cheat when investigators found pictures of her wedding on Facebook. Nicola Haighton, 25, pocketed almost £4,000 in income support by claiming she was a single parent. The model, who has posed for FHM as a 'High Street Honey', failed to tell officials she got married in a lavish £6,000 ceremony in Clitheroe, Lancashire. When she was confronted, she said she'd split from her husband just two days later. The mother, who had a breast enhancement treatment to help with her modelling career, said she had . married on a ‘whim’ and regretted it straight away. However the model, from Accrington, Lancashire, pleaded guilty at Blackburn Magistrates Court to failing to notify a . change of circumstances which affected her entitlement to income . support, council tax and housing benefit. She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £100 costs. The model was first investigated by officials at the Department of Work and Pensions when they received a tip-off she was about to marry brewery worker Daniel Riding. They checked her Facebook page to . discover pictures of the newlywed showing off a diamond engagement ring with . the caption: 'My sparkler - 3 diamonds...meaning i love you!!!' Another caption read: '18ct gold going into platinum - love love love it!!' The officials then checked with the registrar’s . office and noted the date for the £6,000 ceremony at  the luxurious Eaves Hall. Shortly after the day investigators logged back onto the model's social media accounts and . spotted she had opened a new account under the name Nicola Riding. She . had also posted glamorous pictures of herself and her 25-year old husband being showered with . confetti and cutting the wedding cake. Happy day: Investigators from DWP found pictures of the newlyweds - such as this one - on Facebook . One relative posted a message saying: 'Love to you both xxxxx Wish we could do it all again absolutely fabulous day xxxxx.' Catherine Allan, . prosecuting, said the investigation began on July 5 last year after the . benefits fraud office was informed that Haighton, of Oswaldtwistle, was . living with her partner. He worked at Thwaites brewery but she was . claiming as a single parent. Miss . Allan said: 'They checked her Facebook page and there were photographs . of them together advertising the fact they were engaged and due to be . married. 'They contacted the . registrar’s office and it was confirmed they were to be married on July . 19 and he was using the same address as her.' She said the claim had resulted in an overpayment of £3,800. Engagement: Investigators first became suspicious after the model posted this picture of a ring . Mitigating defence lawyer Richard . Prew said: 'She wanted everyone to think everything was going well and . she felt under pressure from Mr Riding’s family to go through with the . wedding. 'He came to live with . her on an ad-hoc basis but she accepts that when he was living there . she should have disclosed it to the authorities.' Speaking today, the mother-of-one, who is volunteering as teaching assistant at local school, insisted she had broken up with husband two weeks after the wedding. Crime: The mother-of-one was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £100 costs . They got back together, then broke up again after four months and yet they’re now back together again. She lives her husband, her inlaws and their son Keaton, three. She said: 'It was horrendous going to court. I didn’t eat or sleep and I’m devastated to be branded a benefit cheat. To me I wasn’t falsely claiming because at the time we weren’t living together. 'I’ve nearly paid all the money back. Daniel doesn’t understand any of it. He says we’ll sort it out and it’ll all be alright.' She added: 'The actual marriage ceremony was brilliant and if I could feel like that every day then life would be perfect. 'But we split up like many others who have problems in their marriage. We were on and off and got married and then split up - it’s not all been plain sailing. 'We split up two weeks after we got married and my friends were saying ""it’s the shortest marriage I’ve ever known"". 'But . I’m not going to be a loser and embarrass myself and post news the . break up all over Facebook - maybe if I had the DWP might have thought . differently. 'But we’re back together now and we’re still married - and I just want to forget about the court case.' The model is no stranger to media attention.

Mark Duggan was clutching a mobile phone in his hand when he was shot dead by armed police, a witness has told an inquest . A witness has told an inquest how Mark Duggan was clutching a mobile phone in his hand when he was shot dead by armed police. The man, referred to as Witness B to protect his anonymity, told the inquest into the 29-year-old's death how he saw Mr Duggan still holding the device as he collapsed after being shot by a police marksman stood 'five to seven steps away'. The witness said he used his own mobile to film the aftermath of the fatal shooting in August 2011, which sparked riots across London and other parts of Britain. More than 50 members of the public packed into an annexe of the courtroom at the Royal Courts of Justice to watch via a video-link as the footage was shown to the jury. Ashley Underwood QC, counsel to the inquest, asked the witness whether he heard a 'commotion' shortly after 6pm on August 4, 2011. 'I heard tyres screeching and then I heard shouting' he said. 'The shouting was either ""put it down or get down"".' Witness B told the inquest he saw armed police wearing blue jackets close to the mini cab Mr Duggan was travelling in. 'When I saw him (Mr Duggan) he was on the sidewalk,' he said. 'He tried to run off towards Tottenham Hale but then there was a police officer standing there.' The witness said he then saw Mr Duggan turn around to run towards Blackhorse Road. 'Could you see his hands?' Mr Underwood asked. 'Yes,' Witness B replied. 'It looked like a phone clutched in his hand. I’ve said that since day one. 'That was definitely a phone clutched in his hand.' CCTV caught this image of paramedics treating Mark Duggan after he was shot . Members of Mark Duggan's family, including his aunt Carol Duggan (second right) and his half brother Shaun Hall (second left), yesterday examine a reconstruction of the scene of his shooting . Asked where Mr Duggan was holding his hands at the time, the witness raised his own hands above his shoulders, the hearing was told. The man told the jury he saw Mr Duggan collapse on the pavement after being shot twice. 'How did you know he had been shot?' Mr Underwood asked. 'I heard the shots,' he replied. 'The way he fell as well. He just collapsed.' Asked how far away the police marksman was from Mr Duggan when the shots were fired, Witness B said: 'About a couple of steps. Five to seven steps.' The BBC challenged an order by the coroner, Judge Keith Cutler, that the broadcaster should reveal the name of the eyewitness who filmed the aftermath of the shooting. Witness B said he used his own mobile to film the aftermath of the fatal shooting in August 2011, which sparked riots (pictured) across London and other parts of Britain . Witness B, who gave his footage to the BBC, admitted he had been reluctant to give evidence at the hearing and had moved out of London following the shooting. 'I took the video, I gave it to the BBC so they could put it out there,' he said. 'I had to move out of London because of it. I wanted to be left alone.' 'What were you worried about?' Mr Underwood asked. 'It’s not everyday you see someone get shot in London and dying,' Witness B said. 'It played on my mind a bit.' The witness said he was also concerned after hearing about gang links in relation to the shooting. Police . have told the inquest that Mr Duggan was being watched by officers . involved in investigating a gang known to use firearms and violence. Witness B said Mr Duggan looked 'baffled' as he stood on the pavement surrounded by armed police. Photograph shows the bullet-holed jacket worn by Mark Duggan on the night he was shot . 'His body language was a bit like: what was going on?' he said. He told the jury Mr Duggan was holding . his hands up, with his palms facing towards the officers and a phone . clutched in his right hand. Leslie . Thomas, representing Mr Duggan’s family, asked Witness B: 'Are you . saying that Mark Duggan was shot when it looked as if he was . surrendering?' 'Yes,' he replied. 'Any doubt about that?' Mr Thomas asked. 'None whatsoever.' Mr Thomas asked Witness B why he had not taken his video footage to the police. 'To be honest, I don’t really trust the police,' the witness replied. 'I just can’t relate to them really.' The response prompted an outburst of applause from members of the public watching the inquest proceedings via videolink. Mounted police patrol the streets in Tottenham, north London as fire burns around them as trouble flared after members of the community took to the streets following the fatal shooting . Questioned by Ian Stern QC, representing the Metropolitan Police’s firearm officers, Witness B confirmed he had been paid by the BBC after handing over the footage he recorded. Notes made by a BBC interviewer during a meeting with Witness B in April 2012 were shown to the jury, in which the witness described Mr Duggan's death as 'an execution'. Asked by his lawyer Jude Bunting whether he stood by the description, he replied: 'Yes.' Mr Stern told the jury there was no reference in the transcript to shouts of 'get down', only that Witness B had heard 'put it down'.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has blamed the rise of needless A&E visits in part on Labour allowing GPs to opt out of working out of hours . Nearly half of all patients who go to A&E do not need treatment, shocking new figures reveal.About a third merely need medical advice while 13 per cent do not even require that. As casualty departments are braced for a winter crisis, many patients are wrongly going to A&E when they should be going to a pharmacy, a GP or using basic first aid. The Health and Social Care Information Centre says 21.7million patients went to casualty last year, up by 57 per cent from 13.8million in 2008/9. Of these, an astonishing 47 per cent left A&E without needing treatment – up from 33 per cent in 2009/10. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the rise in numbers going to A&E is partly due to a disastrous GP contract negotiated by Labour. This allowed family doctors to opt out of working out of hours, leaving patients with nowhere else to go. ‘Labour’s 2004 GP contract did terrible damage to out-of-hours care, leaving many people feeling they have no choice but to go to A&E when they want medical attention,’ Mr Hunt said yesterday. ‘That’s why we are ripping up Labour’s old contract, and bringing back traditional family doctors to take personal responsibility for patients’ care – starting with the over-75s.’ Julia Manning, of the think-tank 2020 Health, said many would not need to go to A&E had they managed to see their GP or even just get hold of them over the phone. ‘It shows a lack of information around first aid, it shows that people’s expectations have changed and there’s much more of a sense of entitlement rather than using services appropriately,’ she said. Senior doctors say this winter could be one of the worst yet for A&E departments due to a lack of senior doctors and rising numbers of patients. Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said: ‘I don’t think I am being particularly shroud-waving when I say this year is going to be one of the worst. It certainly isn’t going to get any better. ‘At the moment we have the capacity to see three-quarters of a million fewer patients than three years ago because we have 370 fewer registrars [senior doctors]. ‘But the number of patients we are having to see has risen by a quarter of a million in the last year.’ Mark Porter, right, chairman of the British Medical Association said the 'shambolic' NHS 111 helpline had worsened the A&E crisis, while Julia Manning, right, from think tank 2020Health said many would not need to go to hospital if they could see their GP or even just get hold of them over the phone . The British Medical Association, . which represents doctors, said the shambolic NHS 111 helpline had . worsened the crisis with call centre workers wrongly telling patients to . go to A&E. BMA . chairman Mark Porter said: ‘Rising attendance rates, coupled with the . Government’s drive to do more with less, mean many emergency departments . are under extreme pressure and are close to capacity. ‘To . alleviate pressure and reduce unnecessary attendance we need to ensure . patients know how and where to access appropriate care and that they get . the right advice first time round. ‘Key . to this is having an effective out-of-hours telephone service,  yet the . disastrous introduction of NHS 111 replaced a clinician-led service . with a call centre and was responsible for many people being wrongly . directed to emergency departments.’ Officials . said the latest statistics could indicate that the figures were being . properly recorded for the first time, rather than being a sign that they . were rising.

Inspired by the dhow boat that carried generations of local fishermen and pearl divers, the stadium weaves together Qatar's past with its progressive vision for the future . Thousands of fans posted tweets likening it to a woman's private parts - something that was almost certainly unintentional. The design, topped with a structure . resembling the sails of a dhow, is meant to tackle the Qatari searing heat and also includes a spectator area outside . the ground that will be temperature controlled at 30C to 32C. The . plan gave no specific details how the cooling system would work, other . than saying it would incorporate 'shading, aerodynamic and mechanical . cooling components'. The . question of the heat during a summer tournament has been a one of . several controversies since Qatar was announced as the winner of the bid . in December 2010. Players' union FIFPro has said it will urge its members not to take part if it . is played in Qatar's summer, even if air conditioning is installed in . the stadiums.

"By . Bernard Jenkin . PUBLISHED: . 17:28 EST, 30 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:25 EST, 30 November 2013 . King Canute, the 11th Century English King, is famous for getting  wet when he commanded the tide to stay back. Is David Cameron a latter-day Canute? Last week, Mr Cameron set himself against decades of EU doctrine by demanding that the right of ‘free movement of people’ in the EU should be a ‘qualified right’. That is to say,  we all recognise that the right that people should be free to travel wherever they wish is a high ideal, but it has practical limits. David and Samantha Cameron at the beach: Leading Tory Bernard Jenkin has compared the Prime Minister to King Canute . The British people are not intolerant or unwelcoming. We have thrived on importing the skills, energy, creativity and rich traditions of other nations. But the British are also a practical people, and don’t like being told what to do. Your elected government should have the right to decide who comes into our country, who stays, on what terms, and who should be forced to leave. Shortly after the UK joined what was misleadingly called ‘the Common Market’ in 1972, Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, said the Treaty of Rome was ‘like an incoming tide. It flows into the estuaries and up the rivers. It cannot be held back’. Reflecting this incoming tide of EU law, the UK is bracing itself for a fresh wave of economic migrants from the newest and poorest members of the EU, Romania and Bulgaria. Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett has even said ‘frictions’ with local people could lead racial tensions to ‘explode’ in a repeat of the riots that rocked Northern towns in 2001. When we joined the EEC, we were one of only eight members. There are now 28. It is one of the joys of our time that so many new countries, who were back then under the jackboot of Soviet communism, can aspire to join the European family of democratic nations. The Camerons holidaying in North Cornwall: Bernard Jenkin says the Prime Minister must do more than he has so far suggested on immigration . But the principle of the ‘free movement of people’ in the EU which seemed sensible back then has today become a dangerous dogma. Back in 1972, if anyone had suggested signing the Treaty of Rome would lead to a million East European migrants coming to the UK, to work, to live in our houses, to use our public services and to draw social security, they would have been scoffed at. But since 2004, that is exactly what has happened. The more honest Labour ex-Ministers such as Jack Straw now frankly admit it was a monumental mistake to expand the EU without placing restrictions on ‘free movement’ in the EU. The Prime Minister says ‘things have gone wrong’. How right he is! Many migrants come to Britain to work, to save and to invest, but many are also attracted by generous child benefit and welfare payments, and access to our free NHS. Bernard Jenkin believes that David Cameron could do more on immigration . Last week, Mr Cameron announced a series of measures to restrict access to benefits and said ‘free movement’ should only be a ‘qualified right’. This is real progress. But there is a problem. That incoming tide of EU law.  Speeches alone will make no difference. You still need all 28 states to agree before you can start unpicking the basic principles of the Treaty of Rome. The Government is already being prosecuted under EU law for trying to restrict benefits to non-UK residents from other EU countries.  And the EU Commissioner Viviane Reding exploded on BBC Newsnight, insisting that ‘free movement is not negotiable, as long as you are a member of the Union’. She’s right. ‘Free movement’ is an article of faith, laid down by the EU Court of Justice. So long as Parliament continues to accept the supremacy of EU law, there is no way David can hold back this tide. Maybe he wants to show that? On Thursday, the key Commons committee on Europe, chaired by Bill Cash, published a groundbreaking report which reminds Parliament that the right to veto European laws was central to our decision to join. It also sets out how Parliament must act  to restore our national democracy. When it is against the national interest, Parliament should recover the right to stop a new European law applying in the UK. Moreover, Parliament could vote to cancel existing EU laws. This is because the EU Treaty itself says the EU must ‘respect the essential state functions’ of member states. It is very significant these recommendations were supported unanimously by MPs from all the three main parties. A recent Daily Mail poll on immigration shows the scale of public disillusion with the entire political class. Everyone knows they clearly cannot do anything. Only the Government can act, and it means doing rather more than Mr Cameron has so far suggested, or he will be drowned in the EU tide. We must take back control over our immigration laws from unelected EU officials and foreign judges. We need our borders under the control of British Ministers, answerable to British laws, made by your democratically elected Parliament and adjudicated by British judges. That’s what democracy means: the right to make or unmake your own laws. King Canute was in fact a wise King.  He wanted to demonstrate his power was limited. I trust David is wise too. By refusing to negotiate, the EU is creating conditions to show everyone why even the most reasonable prime minister must act unilaterally. Bill Cash tabled the Sovereignty of Parliament Bill in the Commons on Friday, to implement his committee’s findings. Parliament can give David the power he needs. He should take it.","Conservative MP for North Essex speaks out over immigration .

Have you ever felt the urge to lie to everybody, ruin the livelihoods of thousands, and make millions of pounds in the process? Well now you can - and you don't even have to go to public school first. A pair of businessmen have found a way to channel the urges that crippled the world's economy in 2008 without actually harming anybody - a family board game where everybody plays as a banker. Designers: Thomas White, left, and Tom White, right, put the game together over the last year . Playing with the economy: The Greedy Nasty Bankers game encourages players to invest recklessly in different markets, which they move between with the roll of the dice . Wildcards: Players are encouraged to double-cross each other with cynical cards like those above . The Really Nasty Bankers Game, made by father and son Thomas and Tom White, encourages players to lie through their teeth, gamble with other people's money, and go running to the authorities when it all comes tumbling down. The Monopoly-style board game casts players as the chief executives of fictitious banks with names like FullerCrookes and the RippOrf Banking Group. The aim is to invest the bank's cash as recklessly as possible without getting caught, and take home the biggest bonus. Each turn the bankers get an opportunity to invest a secret amount of money - measured in billions - in markets like stocks, property and mortgages. Depending on which square they land on, players might get to cash in their investments - and get their hands on a bonus - or ruthlessly crash the market and leave their opponents with nothing. The first banker to trouser £10million is declared the winner. As well as being encouraged to bluff and lie about the level of their investments, players can also use 'really nasty' cards to fiddle the markets, call in the regulators or trick other players into being 'out to lunch' when it's time to cash in. And, as a tribute to the financial crash of 2008 where Lloyds TSB and RBS were bailed out by taxpayers, players also have recourse to a 'public bailout' card. If a market collapses while they are heavily invested in it, the player is allowed to keep all their money. Bunch of bankers: Players invest on behalf of cynically-named institutions such as FullerCrookes Banking Group . Loadsamoney: The aim of the game is to take home the biggest bonus payment, measured in millions . It has been developed over the past year by Tom White, who was involved in marketing Trivial Pursuit and the Who Wants to Be A Millionaire boardgame. Along with his son Thomas, the pair, from Monks Eleigh in Suffolk, have arranged for the game to be stocked in John Lewis and on Amazon, where it retails for £19.99. Mr White said: 'People might not have been very interested in it 10 years ago. 'But with what's happening in the current financial climate, now is the right time to bring the game out.' 'It's all about sabotaging other players' plans. It's a cynical setup - you're encouraged to lie and as long as you get away with it you win' 'My ex-bank manager - who has tried out the game and thinks it's really funny - got a whizzkid from the city to help us with the different investments and advise us on how they should fit into the game. 'We have simplified the system and made it fun. It's a great game for winding people up and it really brings out different personalities.'","The Really Nasty Bankers Game casts players as fictional fatcats .

A 12-year-old schoolgirl died after she caught her foot on a pommel horse and fell during a PE lesson. Paramedics were called to the gym at Taverham High School, Norfolk, on March 12 after Trevyn Hope Joslin, from Thorpe Marriott in Norfolk, injured herself in the fall. Teachers and pupils tried to help her but she died in hospital a week later, an inquest heard. Norfolk Coroner’s Court heard she had a pre-existing neck condition which could have limited her ability to take part in some sports, including gymnastics. The school knew about the condition but because of an administrative oversight had failed to flag it up to all staff, the inquest heard. However, pathologist Nat Cary found the injuries suffered in the fall could have killed somebody with an 'anatomically normal' neck. Norfolk Police and the Health and Safety Executive found no evidence of any failings. A jury concluded she died as a result of accidental death. Assistant coroner David Osborne said: 'A young life when lost is extremely difficult and I would offer my condolences to the family.' Assistant head and PE teacher Shirley Naisby described how she had organised the 'basic flight' gym class. She said Trevyn was 'confident, enthusiastic and one of the better gymnasts in the class'. 'In the last 10 or 15 minutes, the students could select which piece of equipment they wanted to go on and Trevyn selected the horse. Tragic: Trevyn Joslin, pictured with friends in a playground, was described as 'one of the better gymnasts' in her class . Accident: Trevyn caught her foot in a pommel horse, similar to that pictured being used by Olympic gymnast Louis Smith at last summer's Olympic Games . 'She had a few successful jumps then went to make another. She ran up perfectly well but as she jumped her right foot caught the front-end of the horse and she tumbled forward and landed face down on the matt almost in the recovery position. 'Some of her friends were close to her and gathered around where she had fallen. One of them said ""Miss she’s winded"". 'She was trying to mouth words but it was very difficult to hear what she was saying.' An ambulance was called and staff tried to administer first aid. Lynne Hammond, the school’s pastoral care supervisor, administered CPR.

Asbo: Stacey Salder, 18, is pictured leaving King's Lynn Magistrates' Court after being banned from the town of Holt, Norfolk . This is the face of the 18-year-old who 'terrorised' a Georgian market town patronised by royal figures including the Duchess of Cambridge and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Stacey Sadler repeatedly swore at officers, kicked a police car's wing mirror and threw soup around her cell after she was arrested. She was often seen drinking on the streets of Holt, not far from the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Sadler was arrested and bailed after a confrontation with officers, but breached her conditions by walking down the street days later with a bottle of wine. She was today given a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo), which bans her from the town and prevents her from drinking in public anywhere in Norfolk. She is also banned from 'causing alarm, annoyance or distress to others'. Magistrates warned her that she could be jailed if she broke the terms of the order and was brought back to court. Sadler, from Hempstead, near Holt, was fined £400 for threatening behaviour and breaching three conditional discharges, but was told she does not have to pay the fine as she had already spent seven days in custody. She was also ordered to pay £450 of her benefit payments to police for three acts of criminal damage to two police cars and a cell. Sadler admitted all the charges. Holt has become increasingly popular with members of the Royal family in recent years. The Duchess of Cambridge, who is set to move into nearby Anmer Hall with Prince William, has been spotted browsing in the town’s antique shops. 'Terrorised': King's Lynn Magistrates' Court heard how Stacey Sadler swore at officers, kicked a police car and threw soup around her cell . The Duchess of Cornwall has also become a regular visitor, often choosing to buy Christmas presents for Prince Charles at several shops including Holt’s antiquarian bookshop. The court heard that Sadler had committed ‘numerous’ offences of anti-social and threatening behaviour in Holt in recent months and had been in court several times. Prosecutor Alison Cotterill said: 'There have been efforts to make her improve her behaviour, but month after month after month she has been before the court. Drink has been recognised as a problem leading her to behave in a certain way.' She said that police considered Sadler to be ‘a central figure’ in a group of youths involved in anti-social behaviour. Miss Cotterill added: 'They did make stringent efforts to intervene including drawing up an ""acceptable behaviour contract"" for her not to drink in public or cause a nuisance. Shopping hotspot: Holt is becoming increasingly . popular with Royals such as the Duchess of Cornwall, left shopping in . the town, and the Duchess of Cambridge, right . 'That was arranged at a meeting, but afterwards she became drunk and was arrested in Holt. The police have tried to address her behaviour, but there has been little or no response. They feel the time has come for an Asbo.' The court heard how police were called to a deal with a group of rowdy youths in the town’s market place early in the evening on November 20. Sadler, who was in the group, was seen hurling a bottle of cider which smashed in the road near family with young children, said Miss Cotterill. When officers approached her, she screamed abuse, shouting: 'F*** off, you c***s. F*** off, I am going to kill you.' Sadler was arrested for a public order offence and ended up struggling with an officer in front of several witnesses. She kicked a Ford Mondeo police car as she was being taken to a police van, causing £300 of damage to the door. Sadler was restrained and taken to . the Aylsham police investigation centre, where she hurled a mug of soup . against her cell door. When asked why she had done it, she replied, ""Because you lot f***ed me off"". She later made no comment in police interview. Sadler appeared in court the next day, charged with threatening behaviour and criminal damage. She . was bailed as long as she stayed away from Holt, but police saw her in . the town again on November 23, walking along the street and drinking a . bottle of wine. She . was later arrested for breaching her bail, said Miss Cotterill, but when . officers arrived to speak to her, she asked to go outside for a . cigarette and ran away. Picturesque: Holt, a Georgian market town, is not far from the Queen's Sandringham estate. Sadler had been banned from the town as part of her bail conditions, but was spotted by officers walking with a bottle of wine . Neil Meachem, defending, said Sadler came from a good family and had never been involved in trouble before an incident earlier this year which left her ‘upset and angry’ led her to start drinking heavily. He added: 'It is almost like a cry for help. She has been drinking to black out what happened. She needs counselling, help and support.' Presiding magistrate Barbara Dennis said the Asbo was necessary to protect the people of Holt from her behaviour. She told her: 'You can’t go around, taking it out on other people and resorting to alcohol. It is not the answer. You are 18 and you have got your life in front of you and you should not go out terrorising people. 'The people of Holt have got a right to be protected and live without being put in fear. The police are also not here to be insulted and threatened.'","Stacey Sadler, 18, has been handed an Asbo and banned from Holt, Norfolk .

A flagship government scheme to tackle Britain’s troubled families has helped just 720 people back to work. The Whitehall spending watchdog warned the scheme, which set an overall target of getting 20,000 into jobs, was ‘under-performing’ and urged ministers to intervene more quickly when things go wrong. The project is supposed to turn around so-called ‘Shameless’ families, with children back in school, crime cut and thousands of parents back in work. The Department for Work and Pensions project managed to get only 720 into a job, against a target of almost 20,000 . Ministers said they wanted to end the ‘it’s not my fault’ culture which allowed up to 120,000 problem families to avoid taking responsibility for their own lives. The Department for Communities and Local Government’s ‘troubled families’ programme has a budget of £448 million. The Department for Work and pensions (DWP) aimed to get 22 per cent of people on the programme into work employment over three years to March 2015, with a budget of £200 million. But the National Audit Office (NAO) said the DWP programme had achieved only resulted in 720 people finding work, just 4 per cent of its target. None of the firms it was using to provide services had met the department's target. The NAO said that while there was evidence that families were beginning to benefit from the programmes, there was a risk that expectations will not be achieved. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ‘These innovative and ambitious programmes are beginning to provide some benefits but elements of both are underperforming. Community Secretary Eric Pickles said the 'no nonsense' approach of the scheme was working . ‘This is the result of poor co-ordination between the departments when designing and implementing their programmes and of the risks taken in launching the programmes quickly.’ She claimed there was a lack of understanding about how councils and companies would use the payment by results scheme. ‘To achieve their objectives, the departments need to continue to liaise with one another and monitor the success rate of both programmes, adjusting them when necessary. ‘They must continue to work with local authorities and contractors to understand why performance is so varied, intervene if it does not improve, and quickly build an evidence base to show which interventions work best.’ Local authorities in England have turned around 22,000 families, exceeding a 3 per cent target, but they have attached only 62,000 families to the programme, 13 per cent below an NAO estimate. The Government has estimated that the cost to the taxpayer of troubled families was around £9 billion annually for the spending review period of 2010-2015, before the programme was introduced. Of the total, the Government estimated that £1 billion was spent tackling issues including mental health and drug and substance misuse, and £8 billion was spent reacting on areas including social care and the costs of crime, such as court costs. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said: ‘It's difficult to see the DWP programme as anything other than a catastrophe for the vulnerable families who deserve our help but are being let down. ‘First with the work programme and now this, private companies are proving themselves incapable of providing the kind of complex, dedicated support necessary, despite the hundreds of millions of pounds of public money being funnelled their way.’ Mr Serwotka said the poor results also showed that giving work to private firms was ‘fantastically misguided.’ David Cameron launched the troubled families programme in the wake of the 2011 riots in London and other English cities . A DWP spokesman said the numbers reported by the NAO only told part of the story, adding: ‘Jobcentre Plus is doing far more for members of troubled families, including loaning 150 jobcentre advisers to local authorities to help them support people into work. ‘Data published last week showed that since the troubled families programme started in April 2012, 2,400 members of troubled families started a job. This data only covered fewer than half the number of people from troubled families local authorities are currently working with, so we expect the real number helped into work to be much greater.’","David Cameron ordered £450million crackdown in the wake of 2011 riots .

Poised: George Osborne is set to approve a £1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the Government's controversial spending target . George Osborne is poised to approve a £1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the Government’s controversial spending target. The Chancellor has cheered Tory backbenchers in recent years by repeatedly cutting the foreign aid budget to ensure it does not exceed David Cameron’s pledge to devote 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income to the issue. But better than expected growth figures mean that when he makes his Autumn Statement on the economy on Thursday, Mr Osborne is facing the prospect of having to increase foreign aid in order to hit the spending threshold. The money involved is expected to total around £1billion over the next five years, although the Chancellor is understood to have avoided the need to provide extra cash in this financial year. The move will fuel criticism that the ‘arbitrary’ aid target is more about political posturing than saving lives. In August it emerged that Nigeria, which will receive £1.14billion in foreign aid from Britain over the five years of the Coalition, is spending millions to put a man in space. The oil-rich country is also mired in corruption. Estimates suggest between £2.5 and £5billion is stolen from the state’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians. Britain is also spending about £280million a year on aid to India, another country with its own space programme. Last night Tory MP Peter Bone described the increase as ‘absurd’. He said: ‘The aid budget is going to go up, not because there is more need for it or more poverty in the world, but because we have got better economic growth – it is a nonsense. This is why these arbitrary targets are such a mistake. 'We are still borrowing billions a month but, because growth has gone up, we are going to borrow even more so that we can give it away. Oil-rich: Nigeria will receive £1.14billion in foreign aid from Britain over the five years of the Coalition. Above, the Total Nigeria onshore oil and gas refinery at Amenam in the delta of the Niger River in Nigeria . Pledge: David Cameron, left, pledged to hit the aid target as part of a pre-election strategy to 'decontaminate' his party's uncaring image, while Tory MP Peter Bone, right, has described the increase in aid as 'absurd' ‘It is a bizarre and stupid approach – to be honest it’s the sort of thing you would expect from a socialist government.’ Mr . Cameron’s pledge to hit the aid target was part of a pre-election . strategy to ‘decontaminate’ the Tories’ uncaring image, but he has come . under pressure to drop it in the wake of the financial crisis. In March, Mr Osborne said the aid budget would hit £11.2billion this year – more than the Home Office budget. Aid was cut in the Budget, when the growth forecast for this year was reduced from 1.2 per cent to 0.6 per cent. Experts believe the forecast is likely to be upgraded to 1.4 per cent this week, requiring the Chancellor to at least reverse the March cuts, which amounted to £1billion over five years. The Treasury declined to comment, but confirmed that the 0.7 per cent aid target will be met. The Department for International Development also declined to comment. One of the biggest recipients of British aid money was last night accused of covering up allegations of corruption. Supporters: The Global Fund's backers include Bill Gates, right, and U2 singer Bono, left . The Swiss-based Global Fund, which is set to receive £1 billion from Britain over the next three years, is said to have watered down a report into corruption in one of its projects in Cambodia. The publication of investigations into alleged fraud totalling more than £16.5 million in parts of Africa is said to have been delayed for more than a year. The Global Fund’s backers include Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and celebrities such as U2 singer Bono and supermodel Carla Bruni, wife of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. It is one of the world’s biggest aid organisations, with a focus on tackling malaria, tuberculosis and Aids in the developing world. It has spent £13.5 billion over the last decade and claims to have saved millions of lives. An investigation by the BBC’s Panorama programme last night made disturbing new claims about the organisation’s attitude to fraud. The Global Fund said it had a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to corruption. It defended its investigation into the Cambodia project, saying: ‘Only evidence that is confirmed as fact can be included in the final version of a report.’ A Department for International Development source said the Panorama programme related to ‘historic’ allegations, and that ministers had confidence in the Global Fund.","George Osborne is poised to approve a £1billion increase in foreign aid .

"By . Lawrence Booth . PUBLISHED: . 01:51 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:45 EST, 2 December 2013 . Before the start of the Ashes series last summer, one of England’s back-room staff privately voiced concerns about two members of the Australian set-up. Darren Lehmann, soon to replace Mickey Arthur as coach, was one. The other was Ryan Harris, the bullocking but injury-prone fast bowler who until this year had never played more than three Tests in a row because his body simply couldn’t stand the strain. Lehmann has since been credited with helping the Australians to relax, replacing video replays on the team bus of the side’s latest match with music and cans of beer. And Harris, far from breaking down, is now on the verge of a sixth successive Test. No worries: Aussie skipper Michael Clarke is thought to be fine despite having trouble with his ankle in Adelaide . 24 - Harris's wickets in the summer Ashes series. He was second only to Graeme Swann (26), despite playing one Test fewer. 9/10 - Nine of Harris's top 10 dismissals are English, including Alastair Cook (6) and Joe Root and Ian Bell (both 4). 19.58 - Harris's average in the summer, considerably lower than England's top bowlers: Broad (27.45), Swann (29.03), Anderson (29.59), Bresnan (29.60). Since the previous five, starting at Lord’s in July, have brought him 29 English wickets at under 19 apiece, the concerns of the back-room staffer have proved worryingly prescient. And any hopes England might have had of Harris sitting out what could be a gruelling Test for fast bowlers on Adelaide’s drop-in pitch appear to have been dashed by the fast bowler’s insistence that he intends to approach the second Test ‘all guns blazing’. One school of thought before this series suggested he would be allowed to sit out one of the five Tests in order to ensure he was still charging in at 90mph at the series finale in Sydney in the new year. But Harris insisted: ‘I am not going to . miss a Test unless I have to. I have said since the start I am here to . play five Tests. Boof [Lehmann] has not mentioned one word about me . resting which is good. I am feeling good and ready to go.’ All guns blazing: Ryan Harris, with team-mate Peter Siddle looking on, is declared he is ready to go against England in Adelaide . Most of the focus since Australia’s 381-run win at Brisbane has been on Mitchell Johnson, who claimed nine wickets in the match with his pace and hostility. But Harris took five himself, and is in the process of establishing strangleholds over all of England’s major batsmen. In his five Tests this year, he has dismissed Alastair Cook and Joe Root four times each, as well as Kevin Pietersen three times and Ian Bell twice. And the absence of another regular victim, Jonathan Trott (four dismissals), has created a vacancy at No 3 which the Australians are hoping will turn into a weakness. ‘It is a great loss with Trotty not there,’ said Harris. ‘It is going to be interesting to see who they put in there. Hopefully it will be Bell in there early, as it will give us a chance to get him out. Whoever it is, Belly or Joe Root, they are both good players.’ Whole new ball game: Skipper Clarke is all smiles as he passes a rugby ball during an Australian nets session . Danger man: Mitchell Johnson will look to repeat his first Test success against England when the two sides met again this Thursday at the Adelaide Oval . At Brisbane, where Johnson was the bowler who most troubled Trott, it was easily forgotten that Harris had exposed his discomfort against the short ball during the summer. But he had only generous words for his opponent, who flew home last week because of a stress-related illness. ‘Jonathan has gone now,’ he said. ‘I will be disappointed if anyone brings that up on the field. It is not a nice thing he is going through. All the boys who have commented on it have said we want Jonathan Trott back playing cricket. The whole world does. ‘I know the Australian team does, because he is one of their best players and we want to play against their best team. He has made a big decision to go home and I would love to see him back playing soon. The England team needs him, but world cricket needs him too because he is a world-class player.’ Green keepers: Shane Watson is the centre of attention as Australia warm-up ahead of Thursday's second Test . Trott’s departure, however, has not dimmed the hosts’ competitive spirit. A frailty has been noted among the England batsmen, and – drop-in pitch or not – Australia’s fast bowlers intend to exploit it. Harris said: ‘Mitch has already said he is not going to change the way he bowls. No matter what kind of wicket you are on, if you are bowling that quick the bouncers are either going to go over your head – or hit you if they don’t bounce.’ Meanwhile, Michael Clarke was said to be ‘OK’ by Cricket Australia after appearing to roll his right ankle during Monday’s training session at the Adelaide Oval. The Australian captain, who made a century at the Gabba, came through nets practice after repeatedly flexing his right ankle during fielding drills, and is not thought to be in danger of missing the second Test. Movember may be over, but Mitchell Johnson is expected to keep his terrifying tache for the rest of the Ashes. The paceman, who sported a Dennis Lillee-style growth while taking nine wickets at the Gabba, tweeted: ‘Should I keep the Mo?? Well if we can raise $50,000 by Dec 3, I will keep it for the rest of the ashes series! Donate to my mo space.’ Meanwhile, former Aussie paceman Jason Gillespie believes England flattered Johnson in Brisbane. He tweeted: ‘Of the 229 balls Johnson bowled at the Gabba, only 10 would have hit the stumps. England will have seen that.’","Ryan Harris set to play sixth successive Test for Australia .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:18 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:26 EST, 2 December 2013 . Doctors are aiming to lower the epidemic of twins after it was revealed nearly half of all babies born with advanced fertility help are multiple births. In the five years since the Octomom case, big multiple births have decreased but the twin rate has barely budged. Twins have much higher risks of prematurity and serious health problems, leading fertility experts to attempt pregnancy with a single embryo to cut back the chance of conceiving multiples - however it will add an extra $4,000 to the $14,000 cost for IVF. Ken Ernst, left, and his wife Abigail Ernst, right, from New Jersey, conceived their baby using only one embryo during IVF . Fertility experts will also be helped by new ways to pick the single embryos that are most likely to succeed. New guidelines urge doctors to stress this approach. Better ways to screen embryos can make success rates for single embryos nearly as good as when two or more are used . The new techniques include maturing the embryos a few days longer. That improves viability and allows cells to be sampled for chromosome screening. Embryos can be frozen to allow test results to come back and more precisely time the transfer to the womb. Taking these steps with single embryos results in fewer miscarriages and tubal pregnancies, healthier babies with fewer genetic defects and lower hospital bills from birth complications, many fertility specialists say. Multiple studies back this up. In May, doctors from the New Jersey clinics did the kind of research considered a gold standard. They randomly assigned 175 women to have either a single embryo transferred after chromosome screening or two embryos with no screening, as is done in most IVF attempts now. Abigail Ernst poses with her two-month-old daughter, Lucy, in their Oldwick, N.J. home, after undergoing IVF with just one embryo . Delivery rates were roughly equivalent, 61 percent with single embryos and 65 percent with doubles. More than half of the double transfers produced twins but none of the single ones did. Chromosome testing and freezing embryos adds about $4,000 to the roughly $14,000 cost for IVF, 'but the pregnancy rates go up dramatically', and that saves money because fewer IVF attempts are needed, Dr. Richard T. Scott Jr., scientific director for Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey said. Abigail and Ken Ernst of Oldwick, N.J., did this to conceive Lucy, a daughter born in September. Using one embryo at a time 'just seemed the most normal, the most natural way' to conceive and avoid a high-risk twin pregnancy, the new mom said. Not all couples feel that way, though. Some can only afford one try with in vitro fertilization, or IVF, so they insist that at least two embryos be used to boost their odds, and view twins as two for the price of one. Many patients 'are telling their physicians 'I want twins,'' said Barbara Collura, president of Resolve, a support and advocacy group. 'We as a society think twins are healthy and always come out great. There's very little reality' about the increased medical risks for babies and moms, she said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's most recent numbers show that 46 percent of IVF babies are multiples, mostly twins, and 37 percent are born premature. A doctor is seen analyzing an embryo on an Early Embryo Viability Assessment system at a reproductive center (stock library image) By comparison, only three percent of babies born without fertility help are twins and about 12 percent are preterm. It's mostly an American problem, some European countries that pay for fertility treatments require using one embryo at a time. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine is trying to make it the norm in the U.S., too. Its guidelines, updated earlier this year, say that for women with reasonable medical odds of success, those under 35 should be offered single embryo transfer and no more than two at a time. The number rises with age, to two or three embryos for women up to 40, since older women have more trouble conceiving. To add heft to the advice, the guidelines say women should be counseled on the risks of multiple births and embryo transfers and that this discussion should be noted in their medical records. 'In 2014, our goal is really to minimize twins,' said Dr. Alan Copperman, medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, a Manhattan fertility clinic. 'This year I'm talking about two versus one. Several years ago I was talking about three versus two' embryos. The one-at-a-time idea is catching on. Only four percent of women under 35 used single embryos in 2007 but nearly 12 percent did in 2011. It's less common among older women, who account for fewer IVF pregnancies, but it is gaining among them, too. 'Patients don't really want multiples. What they want is high delivery rates,' said Dr. Richard T. Scott Jr. Babies from double transfers were more likely to be premature; more than one-third spent time in a neonatal intensive care unit versus 8 percent of the others. Using two or more embryos carries a much higher risk of twins and much higher rates of cerebral palsy and other disorders. After explaining the risks, 'this is the easiest thing in the world to convince patients to do,' Scott said of screening and using single embryos. But Dr. Fady Sharara of the Virginia Center for Reproductive Medicine in Reston, Va., found otherwise. For a study, he offered 48 couples free medications and embryo freezing if they would agree to transfer one at a time instead of two. Eighteen couples refused, including one-quarter of those whose insurance was covering the treatment. Some who refused said they viewed twins as two for the price of one. 'I tell my patients twins are not twice the fun,' Shahara said. 'One is hard enough. Two at a time is a killer for some people. Some marriages don't survive this.' The New Jersey couple, who had a daughter using a single embryo, has eight more frozen embryos. When it's time to try again, Abigail Ernst said, 'we would do the same thing' and use one at a time .","Doctors aim to lower the rate by attempting fertility with just a single embryo .

A 33-year-old man has revealed how he has coped after his mother arranged the brutal murder of his father with the help of his younger brother. Games-keeper Nigel Bacon was stabbed six times in the driveway of his cottage in Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire, on November 26, 2008. He wife, Susan Bacon, now 59, had phoned for an ambulance after her husband had managed to drag himself bleeding back into their home. Ordeal: Nigel Bacon, pictured with his half sisters Kerry, left, and Lyndsey, face life without their father Nigel . But when paramedics arrived, they found Susan showed little concern for the welfare of her dying 50-year-old husband and calmly sat smoking a cigarette while they fought a losing battle to save his life. It later transpired that Susan had been behind the horrific attack with the help of her son, Michael, now 25, after they hired 29-year-old Peter Jacques to carry out the stabbing. She had also aided Jacque's actions by turning off the lights when Nigel had gone to lock the gates at the end of their drive so the assasin could approach unnoticed by his victim. Her other son, Stuart, who was estranged from the family at the time, was shocked and devastated when he heard what had happened. He reveals on tonight's episode of Britain’s Darkest Taboos on the Crime & Investigation Network: 'To be murdered by your own family, I don't think there's anything lower than that.' Victim: Nigel was stabbed six times on his driveway by a killer hired by his own wife and son . He added: 'When the police phoned me up and told me what happened, I didn't know what to think. I knew my family was strange and everything and that we was different - and obviously I was part of that family at one point - but I didn't think it would go that far.' Stuart haven't had any contact with his family for years after his parents had subjected him to a violent upbringing. In the nineties both Susan and Nigel had been convicted of wilfully ill treating a young person under 16 after they had battered him on numerous occasions and even tied him up. But despite the way he had been treated by his father in his youth, he felt no joy or release in knowing he was dead. He believes his mother should have left or divorced Nigel if she could no longer stand to be with him. 'My dad didn't deserve that, I walked away from everything I knew and loved, if I could do that as a child and lose everything why can't a grown woman do that?' he said. Stuart regrets that he will now never be able to have a relationship with his father. Speaking of his death, he said: 'It made me think of all the time lost and that maybe I should have gone and found him and tried and talked, even if he still didn't want to listen, even if he was still the same man he was. I should have made more of an effort and I wouldn't feel as empty as I do now.' Remarkably, he added that he still feels for his mother despite her cold-blooded actions. He said: 'I'll always love her because she's my mum but I hate her and that will never change.' 'They had a lot of debts around their necks and there were no way my dad would have bailed them out' A jury at Nottingham Crown Court in 2009 heard how Susan had planned the murder with Michael because they were both in debt and wanted to get their hands on Nigel's £350,000 estate. Nigel made his fortune through building a successful security company and then gaining his dream job as a gamekeeper. Stuart said his brother had expected to take over the security firm when Nigel started his new career. But Nigel didn't trust Michael to do the job and refused to hand over the firm to him. Stuart said this would have aggrieved both Michael and his mother and left them bitter and desperate. He explains: 'My mum spent years promising Michael that you put up with this and you do this and that for me and this business will be yours, I promise you. Well my mum couldn't keep that promise as my dad had stuck his heels in and said ""no way"". 'When my dad was like that he meant it, there was going to be no way of changing his mind.' Michael was in need of the job after racking up debts buying cars and getting married. His mother was also living beyond her means and had debts of more than £60,000. 'They had a lot of debts around their necks and there were no way my dad would have bailed them out,' Stuart said. Cold-blooded contract killing: Susan and Michael plotted Nigel's death to gain his fortune . So instead, they jointly conceived a murderous plan to murder Nigel and make it seem like a burglary gone wrong. After approaching a number of people, telling them she was a victim of domestic abuse and needed help to deal with her husband, they eventually hired Jacques, who was also in debt, offering to pay him  'tens of thousands of pounds'. Michael met him to give him an upfront payment of £1,000 the day before they had planned for the murder to take place. Police officer Kate Meynell said Jacques used the money to buy his 'killing kit' - dark clothing, hat, gloves and knives from Tesco. While Susan thought she had planned the perfect murder, Jacques was not an 'effective contract killer' and his hat was found at the scene of the crime. 'I . blame her for everything. She deserves all she gets, I hope she rots in that . prison' By pulling his DNA from the garment, the police were able to trace and arrest Jacques. They then found his links to the Bacon's after checking his mobile phone records. After gathering enough evidence, Susan and Michael are charged and Susan was imprisoned pending the trial. Stuart visited his mother during this time. He said: 'I was expecting to find a woman in bits and she wasn't she was still the same cocky arrogant woman that didn't care about anyone but herself. She was trying to make out to me that Michael was the murderer.' The visit left Stuart, now a father himself, feeling lucky that he broke ties with his family as a teenager. Assassin: Peter Jacques was hired to murder Nigel but left vital clues at the scene . He . said: 'I'd spent years longing for my family and I'm sat there on this visit and I'm . thinking ""thank god you're not near my kids, thank god they are there and . you are in here cause, wow, look what you have done to my brother.""' While Stuart said he will never forgive Susan or Michael, he has some . sympathy for his brother, who was eight when he left him to start his . new life without the family. He . explained: 'I love my brother and he's still that little boy that I . left behind. I know he's a grown man and I know he's done these terrible . things but I find it hard to accept some of what he's done, just . because he's my brother and I know what my mum is like. But I don't . think I can forgive him cause it's still murder.' On 18 December 2009, a jury found Susan, Michael and Jacques guilty of murder. Michael is given a life sentence with a minimum term of 21 years, Susan is sentenced to life with a minimum of 24 years and Peter is also sentenced to life and ordered to serve a minimum of 28 years. The judge calls it a 'cold-blooded contract killing' and describes Michael as his 'mother's creature', claiming Susan was the driving force behind the crime. Stuart is now trying to move on with his life by focusing on his own family. 'I take every day as it comes, I focus on my kids, as long as they are happy and feel loved and stuff like that then I'm happy and that's just how I take life,' he said. Since the trial, he has also forged a relationship with his half sisters, Kerry and Lyndsey, who his father had prior to marrying Susan. Nigel had always denied that Kerry was his daughter but DNA tests after his death confirmed his paternity. Family ties: Kerry, left, and Lyndsey say they will never forgive Susan for arranging their father's death but following his loss they have been able to forge a relationship with half-brother Stuart . Stuart said finding his half sisters was one ray of light to come out of the murder. He said: 'I know that'' daft to say that anything good came out of the circumstances of murder but I've found my family, I’ve got my sisters back.' Kerry and Lyndsey said they will never forgive Susan for her part in murdering their father. Kerry said: 'She could have got out, my mum did, she could have got out no matter what but she wouldn't go anywhere without the money, she'd find another way and the only other way was killing him.' Lyndsey added: 'I blame her for everything. I blame her for taking him away and for taking his life. She deserves all she gets, I hope she rots in that prison.' But they both agree that finding a brother in Stuart has been something positive from their father's loss. Kerry said: 'It's nice to know that he's back in our lives again and he's not on his own.'

Convicted: Herve Mika, 24, avoided deportation on human rights grounds eight months before he attacked a pensioner and broke her pelvis . A violent criminal with a string of convictions fractured an 86-year-old's pelvis eight months after he won a human rights battle to stay in Britain. A judge said Herve Mika, 24, should have been deported to his native Congo in central Africa, five years before he attacked a vulnerable pensioner in Ipswich, Suffolk, a court has heard. Mika was convicted of racially or religiously aggravated assault and affray at Coventry Crown Court in 2008, and the judge recommended he serve his sentence before being thrown out of Britain. However, he successfully appealed against his deportation in July last year, arguing he would not get the medication he needed for his mental illness in the Congo. In March this year Mika, 24, committed grievous bodily harm on a frail 86-year-old at a Sainsbury's. The attack has turned his devastated victim's life upside down, Ipswich Crown Court heard. Mika was trying to flee from staff who suspected him of shoplifting when he pushed the woman to the ground. Ipswich Crown Court heard yesterday there had been doubts over his mental fitness to enter a plea to GBH after the incident in the town. But Mika admitted the charge after being ruled fit to do so. Prosecutor Michael Crimp said he was suspected of shoplifting in Sainsbury's on February 24, but ran off. He returned to the store on March 5. Violence: Mika fled from this Sainsbury's in the centre of Ipswich after shoplifting and pushed over a vulnerable 86-year-old . Mika, of no fixed address, tried to escape again when an employee said they wanted to speak to him. Mr Crimp said he shoved the elderly woman to the ground with 'some force', wrecking her life. The court was told that Mika was first convicted at Birmingham juvenile court in 2006. He also has convictions for theft and assault. Mr Crimp said Mika had also been convicted of battery on two people he had met in the street. It also emerged that the serial offender was given a 12-month conditional discharge by Norwich magistrates last Friday for assaulting a prison officer. Sentencing Mika for GBH at Ipswich Crown Court, Judge David Goodin ordered him to be detained without time restriction under the Mental Health Act.","Judge said Herve Mika, 24, should leave Britain after a 2008 conviction .

People who suffer repeated blows to the head, such as footballers like David Beckham who often header the ball, are more likely to develop Alzheimer's . People who suffer repeated blows to the head are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease, new research suggests. Possible links between contact sports and an increased risk of developing dementia have previously been identified but no firm scientific ties have been established. Now, researchers from the University of Cambridge have developed a more detailed picture of how the disease takes root, which could provide a better understanding. They used laser imaging to identify clusters of a protein, called tau, on the brains of sufferers and found possible links to neuronal damage, for example through head injuries inflicted during sport. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, welcomed the development. He said: ‘The state-of-the-art technology used by this research team allows a unique insight into the molecular events that occur in Alzheimer's. ‘Investigating how the tau protein spreads between nerve cells can help researchers better understand what causes the disease and offer new approaches for treatments. ‘It is unclear from this study whether head injury could trigger this molecular process, but it is a risk factor for dementia that needs to be investigated further.’ The study, reported in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, focused on the tau protein. This is found inside healthy brain cells but clusters of malfunctioning tau, which prevent brain cells from working properly, are found in the brains of those who have died with Alzheimer's. When small quantities of the protein were added to the outside of brain cells, the cells immediately started to ingest it, the study found. The resulting clumping caused healthy proteins to misbehave. In real life such clumping could be triggered by repeated head injuries, such as those suffered in contact sports. Researchers used laser imaging to identify clusters of a protein, called tau, on the brains of sufferers and found possible links to neuronal damage, for example through head injuries inflicted during sport. Muhammad Ali suffered years of blows to the head and was later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease . Researchers urged caution, saying . that their study used a model cell culture and the processes which . enable the disease to take root and develop in the brain could be far . more complicated. Clemens . Kaminski, professor of chemical physics at the University of Cambridge, . who led the research, said: ‘These are molecular-level glimpses of what . may be going on. ‘We are just beginning to see the . molecular steps that may provide an explanation for what we see in the . brains of patients who have died of Alzheimer's. It was revealed in September that former footballer Jimmy Hill has Alzheimer's disease . ‘The study underlines how significant the uptake of small quantities of tau might be as an initiator for the conditions that then prevail in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers. ‘It is one piece in the puzzle that could provide us with an explanation as to why head injuries may be connected to the disease. It's not necessarily correct - but it is plausible.’ Although links between Alzheimer's and contact sport are yet to be firmly established, previous studies have found professional American footballers are three times more likely to have neurodegenerative diseases compared with the general public. Earlier this year the NFL reached a multimillion-pound settlement to compensate more than 4,500 retired players diagnosed with conditions including dementia, depression or Alzheimer's which they blamed on blows to the head. Researchers trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's have long focused on the role of tau - an abbreviation of Tubulin Associated Protein Unit - and this is the first insight into how the dysfunctional protein emerges and spreads. Dr Gabriele Kaminski-Schierle, who led biological aspects of the research, said: ‘We still do not know if we can stop cells from ingesting tau, or whether we can somehow wash tau out of the brain fluid. ‘Answering these questions is key to developing future therapies to treat what remains, at the moment, a terrible and incurable disease.’","Clusters of a protein called tau on the brains of people with Alzheimer's could be linked to neuronal damage caused by repeated blows to the head .

Leaving a beloved pet behind for a holiday, or even for a long day at work, can be heart-wrenching. But now there is a device that lets owners video chat with their dog or cat from anywhere in the world and even reward them with a treat. PetChatz claims to be the first-ever videophone of its kind and comes with a colour camera so that pets and owners can see each other. Scroll down for video . The PetChatz device lets owners video chat with their dog or cat from anywhere in the world using their computer or smartphone, and even lets them give their pet a treat remotely . Pet owners mount the PetChatz unit at their pet's eye level. It must also be close to an electrical source. The device is then connected to a W-iFi network. The unit is filled with low calorie treats and 'scentz pads' that have a calming effect. Owners can log into PetChatz.com on their computer or via the PetChatz smartphone app to talk to their pet. A special ringtone tells pets their owner is calling so they can be trained to run to the video phone. Owners can then say hello via their device's colour screen and reward their pets with snacks and scents. They can record and share videos too. Both cats and dogs can see in colour, although neither animal's eyesight is as good as a human's. The device, which is available to pre-order from the Minnesota-based firm, dispenses treats and discharges a soothing scent for animals that are home alone, while also recording the animal’s antics so that owners can share videos of their pet’s reactions. However, what PetChatz describes as ‘a joyful sensory experience’ comes at a price -  $349 (£213) - and the device is expected to ship in early 2014 to customers only in the U.S. and Canada. The company said: ‘[The pets] see you, hear you, and feel your love with the tasty treats and soothing scents you provide. 'Your day becomes a little easier; the time away feels a little shorter.’ The device, which costs $349 and contains a colour screen, is due to ship early next year and is mounted at a pet's eye level on a wall. It can dispense treats as well as wafts of calming smells when an owner calls . A special ringtone alerts dogs and cats to a phone call - and possibility of a treat- from their owners - so owners can train their animals to dash to the videophone unit . The PetChatz unit is mounted on a wall at the pet's line of sight and claims to be safe for animals and ‘chew resistant’ so it cannot be easily damaged. It is filled with treats and contains 'scentz pads’ in a variety of comforting smells to soothe pets. The device is connected to a Wi-Fi network and owners log on to PetChatz.com on their computer or use a smartphone app to talk to their pet. A special ringtone tells the pet when its owner is calling, at which point the screen is activated and the video conversation is possible - providing the pet runs to the phone. Owners can record and share videos of their pet's reactions as well as dispensing treats. The company said the device is portable so that pet owners can take it to a vets or boarding kennel when on holiday and can talk to their pets there. The device is connected to a Wi-Fi network and owners log on to PetChatz.com on their computer or use a smartphone app to talk to their pet. The unit includes a camera so that owners can record their pet's reactions and share them with friends at a later date . Brooke Martin, 15, from Spokane, Washington has also invented a doggy videophone, although hers is not as sleek and compact as the high-end PetChatz offering. iCPooch, an Internet-enabled device powered by a Raspberry Pi computer, also allows dog owners to video chat with their pets and deliver dog treats from afar, but the device is only at the prototype stage. iCPooch acts like a computer, using a Raspberry Pi motherboard and Wi-Fi module to connect to the internet. The computer is attached to a motor which is activated when the owner of the device gives it the ‘drop treat’ command from a remote computing device. A removable sleeve inside the device houses the treats, and one treat is pushed out by the motor arm each time the motor is activated. Software for the system is also run in The Cloud, allowing an owner to log in to a personal account. According to the iCPooch team, an estimated 13 million dogs suffer from separation anxiety, as well as many pet owners. iCPooch has also come up with an internet-enabled device powered by a Raspberry Pi computer, which allows dog owners to video chat with their pets and deliver treats from afar .","A company in Minnesota claims to have produced the first ever videophone for pets and their owners, and it costs $349 .

Hospitals are being urged to ban patients, relatives and staff from smoking anywhere on their grounds under new NHS guidelines. Some trusts are already considering handing out fines to anyone who breaches the rules and threatening employees with the sack. Guidelines from the health watchdog NICE today tell hospitals to outlaw smoking across their premises in car parks, gardens or in shelters just outside. A woman lights up outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital (file photo). Hospitals are being urged to ban smoking on their grounds, with patients facing fines if they break the rules . But opponents fear it will lead to hospitals employing wardens to patrol grounds and rigging up extra CCTV cameras to catch patients and staff flouting the ban. There are also concerns that doctors and nurses are being coerced into nagging and bullying patients to give up smoking when they are busy enough trying to treat them. Nurses and other staff would be banned from escorting patients outside to enjoy a cigarette (stock image) The guidelines urge hospitals to ban patients from going outside for a cigarette at any point during their hospital stay even if they are in for several weeks. Nurses and other staff will be forbidden from escorting patients outside to smoke and instead will be urged to offer them advice on quitting. GPs, other doctors, nurses and midwives are also urged routinely to quiz patients about whether they smoke when they come to the hospital or surgery. The guidance is not bound by law so it will be up to individual trusts to decide when to ban smoking and how strictly to enforce the rules. But some, including Barts in London, are already considering imposing fines of £75 for patients,  relatives and staff as part of a zero-tolerance policy. Consultants and senior nurses will be given the power to threaten to  discharge patients who ignore warnings to stop smoking, while security staff will patrol outdoor areas. And Cambridge University Hospitals – where a ban will come into force on January 1 – is considering disciplining staff and implementing fines if the rules are not obeyed. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: ‘The idea behind this is not to create a penal culture but it is about a culture shift. It’s clearly absurd that the most lethal set of toxins to the human body are being passively encouraged in hospitals. ‘We’ve known since 1952 that smoking kills you and 61 years have passed and we’re now tackling the problem in hospitals. That’s too long.’ But Simon Clark, director of Forest which opposes smoking bans, said: ‘NHS staff have a duty of care to  protect people’s health but that doesn’t include the right to nag, cajole or bully smokers to quit. ‘It’s not only heartless and inhumane to ban patients from smoking outside hospitals and clinics, it’s almost impossible to enforce without installing CCTV cameras and employing wardens to monitor the grounds.’ Gone are the days when patients such as Speedway star Ronnie Moore (pictured in 1954 after suffering a broken leg) could enjoy a cigarette in their hospital bed .","Staff would be banned from escorting patients outside for a cigarette .

Patsy Kensit has revealed that she has had just four boyfriends - and they all became her husband . Although Miss Kensit has only ever married musicians, she sealed her reputation as a rock chick when she began dating Oasis front man Liam Gallagher, who went on to become her third husband. Speaking at a debate in London on the importance of a woman’s looks in public life, the star was asked if she had ever used her body to trap men. Miss Kensit, who once stripped off for a topless session with Vogue in the 1990s, declined to answer the question directly and instead quipped: ‘I married all my boyfriends.’ Her first marriage came as she made her own foray into the pop world as the lead singer of Eighth Wonder, who had two top 20 singles in 1988.

David Cameron suggested it would be difficult for the Tories to meet a key immigration target yesterday as he rejected suggestions his Government is losing its grip after a series of U-turns. The Prime Minister insisted tough measures to limit the number of incomers would continue - but pointed out that fewer Britons were leaving for foreign climes. Before the election, the Conservatives said they aimed to cut net migration from around 250,000 a year under Labour to the ‘tens of thousands’. David Cameron, on a trade trip to China, has admitted that it will be difficult for the government to meet targets on immigration, because not enough people are leaving Britain . But the latest figures showed that 182,000 more people came to Britain than left in the year to June, up from 167,000 in the year before. Mr Cameron dismissed the idea that the target was ‘impossible’ to meet because fewer Britons are now emigrating to the struggling Eurozone. ‘I don’t accept that,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘If you take the whole three year period [since the election], net immigration is down by a around third. But he said: ‘The action we have taken takes some time to come through - getting rid of bogus colleges, trying to make sure that people who don’t have a right to stay here leave, making sure that family reunion really is just that. The delicacy bamboo fungus – thought to be an aphrodisiac – was served twice to David  Cameron on his first day in China yesterday. The tropical mushroom, also known as tropical stinkhorn or phallus indusiatus, is renowned for its pungent smell. It has been part of Chinese haute  cuisine since the 17th century. The delicacy was served to Mr Cameron and other guests as the Chinese People’s Liberation Army band played at a lunchtime banquet hosted by  Premier Li Keqiang. At an evening banquet with President Xi Jinping, it was on the menu again as soup accompanied by sturgeons’ marrow. Mr Cameron was also presented with gifts from Premier Li Keqiang, including a painting of a horse, a model of a bullet train and a doll for the Prime Minister’s youngest child Florence. In return, he gave his Chinese counterpart - a keen tennis fan - a racquet signed by Andy Murray. His wife Professor Cheng Hong, an English professor, received a selection of Booker Prize winning novels, by authors including Hilary Mantel and Julian Barnes. The couple were also presented with a selection of biographies: Charles Moore on Baroness Thatcher; Roy Jenkins on Churchill; Douglas Hurd on Disraeli; William Hague on Wilberforce; and the Daily Mail’s Robert Hardman on The Queen. President Xi was presented with an England football shirt signed by the team, while his wife was given a pair of gloves by Mulberry. ‘A lot of these things take an amount of time to be dealt with.’ But he went on to point out that when the Tories set the goal of reducing net migration to tens of thousands a year - one which has never been accepted by the Liberal Democrats - at a time when emigration was helping to balance our immigration. ‘I made the pledge of trying to get net migration down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands, on the basis that actually over the previous period migration flows within Europe have been relatively balancing out when it’s been migration from outside Europe that’s been topping up the numbers. 'We have seen that migration from outside Europe come down in terms of net figures and we need to make further progress. ‘So I’ll keep going on this. It’s very important. The British public want firm and consistent action on immigration and that’s exactly what they’re getting from me.’ Only last week it emerged net . migration had risen for the second consecutive quarter to 182,000 - . mostly with people fleeing eurozone countries in sourthern Europe. But . the largest group of migrants came from China - in the form of . students. About 40,000 arrived in the 12 months to June, 8.7 per cent of . the total, and means China has overtaken India as the leading source of . immigrants. However officials pointed out that the majority did leave again at the end of the courses. The . Prime Minister insisted the coalition was still working well - pointing . to the weekend deal on slashing green levies to bring down energy bills . by around £50 a year. He . said the coalition parties had also reached ‘good agreements on . immigration’ but claimed the Lib Dems were a restraint on tougher . measures. He added: ‘Would I like to go further? Yes I would.’ Mr . Cameron said he was not concerned about the perception that the . Government was being buffeted by events, having made U-turns on issues . including capping interest rates on payday loans and plain cigarette . packaging, and responded to Labour’s promise of an energy price freeze . with action to cut bills. ‘On . payday lending, this is the first government that has actually . regulated properly this industry. We got in, we weren’t happy with what . we saw, we set up the Financial Conduct Authority, properly regulating . payday loans.' A key Tory election pledge was to reduce immigration to 'tens of thousands' but in the year to June net migration rose to 182,000 from 167,000 the year before . Mr Cameron added: 'But I think it’s right, you look at the evidence, listened to the arguments and I think it’s time for an interest rate cap. ‘On energy prices, if you can cut household energy bills by rolling back on the cost of levies then it makes sense to do so. ‘This . is something I announced I would do in the House of Commons and a month . later we have done it. That’s good politics. You say you’re going to do . something, you work hard to achieve it, and then you do it.’ Part of the rise can be explained by the fact that fewer Britons are leaving the UK than three years ago (file pic) On the move towards plain cigarette packets, which comes months after the Government shelved the idea, the Prime Minister said: ‘You look at the evidence, look at what’s happening overseas, look at the evidence of what works, and take the appropriate course. ‘If you look at the big picture of this Government, that has taken incredible difficult long-term decisions to turn the economy round, decisions we can now see are paying off as our economy is growing, unemployment is falling, there are 400,000 new businesses are operating, the world is beginning to see that the British economy is one of the most open, exciting and dynamic in the world. ‘Listen to businesses... their sense of momentum in the British economy. This is a government that has a long-term plan to turn the country round. ‘So whereas obviously in the bubble people can get obsessed by this decision or that decision, the big picture about this Government is that it has taken difficult decisions, it has stuck to them and it’s really beginning to deliver for the British economy.’","David Cameron said immigration target will be difficult to meet .

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond was challenged about his plans to join the EU . Alex Salmond today desperately insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to stay in the European Union, after the idea was rejected out of hand by the Prime Minister of Spain. The Scottish National Party’s blueprint for independence depends on Scotland negotiating its way into the EU. But the plan collapse within 24 hours when Spain’s Mariano Rajoy insisted it could not become an EU member automatically and he would veto it. Mr Salmond has insisted that Scotland would be able to join the EU if it votes Yes to independence next year but Mr Rajoy’s intervention exploded that claim. Spain is opposed to Scottish secession since the government in Madrid is also resisting attempts by Catalonia and the Basque region to break away. The Spanish premier told a press conference: ‘If part of a member state becomes independent, it would be left out of the European Union and it would be good for citizens (in the EU) and Scots to know that,"" he is reported to have said. Mr Rajoy added this meant ‘EU entry would need to be approved by all 28 member states’. He went on: ‘I am very clear, as everyone is, that a country that obtained independence from the EU would end up outside of it, and it’s right that Scottish citizens and all the citizens of the Union know that. ‘What I want is for the Scottish to be presented realistically with the consequences of secession. ‘If one part if a member state splits, it would become a third country in relation to the EU. It is the law.’ He added: ‘The times we live in demand strong countries and unity is not contrary to autonomy, it is a guarantee of strength in an increasingly complex and globalised world.’ The remarks from one of the EU’s senior . leaders have been seized on by opponents of independence, who challenged . Mr Salmond at Hollyrood today. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said that all 28 EU member states would have to agree to allow a new member in, and he would be likely to veto Scotland . The First Minister said if there was a Yes vote in next year's referendum Scotland would be ‘negotiating its position from within the European Union’ - citing a letter from the European Commission in support of this. Labour's Johann Lamont, Tory Ruth Davidson and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie all attacked Mr Salmond on the matter at First Minister's Questions. Ms Lamont went on the attack, saying: ‘The Spanish prime minister is being straighter with the people of Scotland than the First Minister.’ But Mr Salmond said: ‘The difference is Scotland would be negotiating its position from within the European Union.’ The First Minister then cited a letter from the European Commission, which he said stated it would ‘of course be legally possible to renegotiate the situation of the UK and Scotland within the European Union’. He said that was ‘reasonably substantial evidence that Scotland as a nation can negotiate its position to full membership within the European Union’. On Tuesday Mr Salmond launched his historic 670-page blueprint covering all areas of life in an independent . Scotland. At the launch he was dogged . by questions about how he will get the Westminster government, . Brussels, Nato, Buckingham Palace and the BBC to agree to his ambitious . plans. It revealed he wants the UK to continue to bail-out . Scotland's banks, shoulder its debts and fund degrees for its students.

"PUBLISHED: . 18:20 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:42 EST, 2 December 2013 . Seeking answers: The judge who heads the family courts, Sir James Munby, has demanded to know why the girl should not be reunited with her mother . Social workers who made a mother give up her baby after a forced caesarean must explain themselves to Britain’s top family judge. In a highly unusual intervention, Sir James Munby has demanded to know why the girl should not be reunited with her mother, a 35-year-old Italian. Fabio Roia, the most senior judge in Milan, said the woman’s treatment by a secret court resembled a horror film – an unprecedented ‘act of extreme violence’ that could not have happened in Italy. The mother, who was suffering from a mental illness, was subjected to a caesarean on the orders of the controversial Court of Protection. Her ex-husband and her parents, who look after her two other children, insisted they would care for the girl. But, in a second secret hearing, a court ruled that her girl should be removed from her care for adoption by a British family. Campaigners said it was wrong for a closed-doors court to force a foreign citizen to have an invasive medical procedure and seize her child against her will. The extraordinary case will lead to growing calls for the courts involved in the case to be opened to public scrutiny. There was also intense criticism of the children’s services officials in Essex. Shami Chakrabarti, of the Liberty pressure group, said: ‘At first blush this is dystopian science fiction unworthy of a democracy like ours. Forced surgery and separation of mother and infant is the stuff of nightmares that those responsible will struggle to defend in courts of law and decency.’ Bipolar UK, the charity that helps people with the illness affecting the mother, condemned the decision by a Court of Protection judge. ‘The forced caesarean and continued separation of mother and child is, we believe, unprecedented,’ it said. ‘But officials should make every effort to consult with the family before decisions are taken.’ The woman arrived in England last summer, while pregnant, for a training course at Stansted airport. During her stay she suffered an episode of ill health, and was sectioned. The newborn was taken into state care on the orders of a judge in the notoriously secretive Court of Protection, despite the mother's pleas to be allowed to raise her. File picture . A judge in the Court of Protection, the routinely secretive court that makes decisions for incapacitated people, ruled in August 2012 that she should undergo the forced caesarean. County court judges, again in secret hearings, backed social workers who immediately took the mother’s newborn into care. At a county court hearing in Chelmsford in February this year Judge Roderick Newton heard the mother beg that she should not lose her child for ever. The judge ruled the girl should be placed for adoption – even though he accepted that the mother was well, successfully taking medication and had a job. He said the mother might stop taking her drugs and the family offers were ‘not a starter’. Sir James Munby, who is the President of the Family Division of the High Court, ordered yesterday that further moves towards adoption must be heard before him in the High Court. Shami Chakrabarti, of the Liberty pressure group, said: 'This is dystopian science fiction unworthy of a democracy like ours.' Right, Lib Dem MP John Hemming is a long-standing campaigner against court secrecy . Sir James, who took over the family courts in January, has made a series of judgments and speeches demanding greater openness in family hearings and in the Court of Protection. He has said family hearings should be held in public, that social workers should be named in court, and that families who feel wronged should be able to speak out publicly. John Hemming, the Lib Dem MP who has campaigned for open justice, said: ‘I welcome the transfer of the case from Chelmsford County Court to the High Court in front of the President of the Family Division. The appointment is a very positive step.’ The case has amazed Italian experts. Ernesto Caffo, of the charity Telefono Azzuro, said: ‘It is a story that defies all logic. ‘Mental illness requires special care in a delicate period such as pregnancy. But women who suffer from it generally carry their child full term and are then, if necessary, given support in their role as parents.’ In a statement, Essex children’s services said a health trust had applied for the forced caesarean after telling social workers it had concerns over risks to the health of mother and baby. It said Italian courts had been made aware of the case and ‘social workers liaised extensively with the extended family.","Sir James Munby has demanded answers in extraordinary case .

The selfie may have been named word of the year by Oxford University Press last month, but today, Merriam-Webster announced 'science' to be their word of 2013. The publisher of Oxford dictionaries tracked a huge jump in overall . usage of selfie, but Merriam-Webster stuck primarily to look-ups on its . website, recording a 176 percent increase for science when compared with . last year. 'The more we thought about it, the righter it seemed in that it does lurk behind a lot of big stories that we as a society are grappling with, whether it's climate change or environmental regulation or what's in our textbooks,' said John Morse, president and publisher of Merriam-Webster Inc., based in Springfield, Massachusetts. The word 'science' is seen on a page of a Merriam-Webster dictionary - it is the publisher's word of the year . Science, he said, is connected to broad cultural oppositions, science versus faith, for instance — along with the power of observation and intuition, reason and ideology, evidence and tradition. Of particular note, to Merriam-Webster, anyway, is fallout from the October release of Malcolm Gladwell's latest book, 'David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants.' Gladwell, a popularizer of scientific thought and research in best-sellers and The New Yorker magazine, takes on the challenges of obstacles and the nature of disabilities and setbacks in the book. But he leaves science itself, according to some critics, as a rhetorical device for his main mission of storytelling. The tweets, blog posts and online commentary about the book, yay and nay, proliferated as Gladwell hit the road to promote it. Peter Sokolowski, a lexicographer and editor at large for Merriam-Webster, called the Gladwell dustup a symptom of where science stands today. With the explosion of information and technology, are we all scientists? 'You have scientists writing long pieces, purportedly reviews of his new book, basically criticizing him, and then his response is: 'Hey, buddy. I'm not a scientist. I'm a writer who's trying to promote the work of scientists. 'To contextualize it. To make it accessible.' You know, 'Don't blame me for not being a scientist' is basically his response,' Sokolowski said. Jason Silva is neither scientist nor academic. He's a techno optimist, filmmaker, performance philosopher and host of the popular Brain Games show on the National Geographic Channel. 'Ooh, that's awesome,' he said upon learning of science's dictionary shout-out. 'People are increasingly scientifically minded, and that makes me very happy.' Count him among those who believe art and science are two sides of the same coin. Right now, thanks to the digital ease of sharing information and the explosion of technology, 'The world is infinite. You can indulge your curiosity.' Are more people looking to science for inspiration, hence looking up the word on a dictionary website for solace or motivation? 'We bear witness to the astonishing capacities for scientific knowledge to aid us in transcending our seeming boundaries, to realize they're not really boundaries,' Silva offers. 'It's a great thing. Let's celebrate that.'","Merriam-Webster chose its word of the year by tracking look-ups on its website .

A new communications satellite that has both public and government applications has been launched into space aboard a private rocket. The 22-story SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Tuesday evening, carrying the 7,000-pound satellite. It will be placed in geostationary orbit. That means it will orbit at a fixed point above Earth, in sync with the Earth’s rotation. Scroll down for video... We have liftoff: A Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket lifts off from Launch Complex 40 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket is carrying its first commercial payload, a communications satellite . The launch was originally scheduled for early this year, but has been delayed by technical issues with the rocket. The last try was on Thanksgiving Day when two attempts were aborted. The SES-8 satellite will be used in conjunction with another communications systems to increase bandwidth capacity in Asia and provide expansion of services such as maritime communications and distance learning programs. 'I'd like to thank SES for taking a chance on SpaceX,' company founder and chief executive Elon Musk posted on Twitter an hour before the launch. 'We've given it our all.' About 30 minutes after liftoff, the satellite, known as SES-8 and worth more than $100 million, was in an elliptical orbit that reached more than 50,000 miles from Earth, about a quarter of the way to the moon. Blastoff: After two scrubbed launch attempts, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket finally blasted off on Tuesday to send a commercial satellite where no SpaceX payload has gone before: 22,000 miles up, into geostationary orbit . From there, SES-8 will maneuver itself down to a circular, 22,369-mile (36,000-km) high orbit to provide television, broadband and other communications services to customers in India, China, Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia. The delivery of the SES-8 satellite 'confirms the upgraded Falcon 9 launch vehicle delivers to the industry's highest performance standards,' Musk said in a statement after the launch. 'We appreciate SES's early confidence in SpaceX and look forward to launching additional SES satellites in the years to come,' he said. SES-8 is the first commercial communications satellite to be launched from Cape Canaveral in four years. In the 1980s, the United States dominated the commercial launch industry, now worth about $6.5 billion a year, a report by the Satellite Industry Association trade organization showed. Game changer: SES reportedly paid less than $60 million for the launch, which is tens of millions of dollars less than the going rate for satellite launches heading for geostationary orbit . The global satellite industry overall had revenues of nearly $190 billion in 2012, including nearly $90 billion in television services alone, the trade group said. 'It's an extremely important satellite for us,' Martin Halliwell, chief technology officer of SES, told reporters before the launch. 'We know that as we go forward into these very significant growth markets that it's absolutely critical that we have a cost-effective and efficient way to get to orbit. That's really what SpaceX has brought us,' Halliwell said. Previous SES satellites were launched primarily aboard Russian Proton and European Ariane rockets, which cost far more than the approximately $55 million the company paid for its ride on SpaceX's Falcon booster, he said. Up up and away: SpaceX has a dozen Falcon 9 launches on its manifest for next year, including more geostationary satellites . Halliwell would not say exactly how much SpaceX undercut the competition, but did say SES received a discount by agreeing to fly on Falcon 9's first mission to high orbits used by communications satellites. In addition to a September 29 test flight of an upgraded Falcon 9, older versions of the rocket flew five times successfully, including three missions for NASA to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, which orbits about 250 miles above Earth. SpaceX's launch schedule includes nearly 50 missions, worth about $4 billion. About 75 percent of the flights are for commercial customers. The company needs one more successful launch of its upgraded Falcon rocket to be eligible to compete to carry the U.S. military's largest and most expensive satellites, a market now monopolized by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.","The launch could be a 'game change' for the satellite industry .

A California woman who became the first ever ticketed for driving while wearing Google Glass in October pleaded not guilty Tuesday. Cecilia Abadie appeared unfazed by the charges as she yucked it up with her attorney in a San Diego traffic courtroom. Abadie was pulled over for allegedly doing 80mph in a 65mph zone October 29 and was fined before promptly uploading a photo of the ticket to Google Plus. Scroll down for video . Not sweating it: Cecilia Abadie appeared jovial December 3 when she appeared in a San Diego court to plead not guilty to the first ever ticket written for driving while wearing Google Glass . Double trouble? The software developer was pulled over October 29 for speeding on a California freeway, then given another charge for doing it while wearing the head-mounted computer. Here, she dons the glasses following her court date . In addition to speeding, her violation was ‘driving w/monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)’. Abadie, a software developer and tech true believer, pleaded not guilty to both charges. Her . attorney William Concidine said she will testify at a trial scheduled . for January that the glasses were not on when she was driving, and . activated when she looked up at the officer as he stood by her window. The device is designed to respond to a head tilt by waking itself up. Concidine . also said the vehicle code listed in the citation applies to video . screens in vehicles and is not relevant to mobile technology such as . Google Glass. Standing firm: Cecilia Abadie, center, stands before court commissioner Karen A. Riley with her attorney William M. Concidine.

Laws against driving while wearing Glass have gained traction in Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. Here, she listens to her lawyer while gazing into the head mounted computer . The California Highway Patrol declined comment on Concidine's assertions. 'This has to play out in court,' spokeswoman Fran Clader said. The technology will not be made widely . available to the public until 2014, but defendant Cecilia Abadie was one . of about 10,000 'explorers' who received the glasses earlier this year . as part of a tryout. At the time of Abadie's citation, the CHP said anything which takes a driver's attention from the road is dangerous and should be discouraged. Unfazed: Abadie seemed carefree as she walked out of the San Diego traffic court Tuesday. She's expected to take the stand when the trial commences in January . The lightweight frames are equipped with a hidden camera and tiny display that responds to voice commands. The technology can be used to do things such as check email, learn background about something the wearer is looking at, or to get driving directions. Legislators in at least three states - Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia - have introduced bills that would specifically ban driving with Google Glass. Chris Dale, a spokesman for the tech giant, said he was not aware of any other tickets issued for driving with Google Glass. Google's website contains an advisory about using the headgear while driving: 'Read up and follow the law. Above all, even when you're following the law, don't hurt yourself or others by failing to pay attention to the road.' Fined: Cecilia Abadie, a Google Glass explorer, was pulled over on Tuesday and given a ticket for wearing the smart device while driving . Illegal: Abadie's violation was 'driving w/monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)', according to the ticket, which she posted on Google Plus . The law prohibits drivers from operating vehicles if ‘a television receiver, a video monitor, or a television or video screen, or any other similar means of visually displaying a television broadcast or video signal that produces entertainment or business applications, is operating and … visible to the driver’, according to International Business Times. The law exempts GPS devices, parking assist camera monitors, and ‘interlocking’ devices that automatically disable when the vehicle is in motion. Google Glass is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display that is being developed by Google with a mission of producing a mass-market product, which displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format, and which can communicate with the internet via natural language voice commands. The Explorer Edition is available to testers and Google I/O developers in the United States for $1,500, while a consumer version is expected to be available in 2014.

Abadie, who is a self-confessed ‘geek and Google Glass pioneer’, received many support messages since the incident, some suggesting she challenge the ticket. A fellow Glass Explorer, Matt Abdou, offered to help Abadie fight the ticket in court, according to the Times. ‘This law is to prevent people from watching TV in their car. Seriously.

With the familiar winding streets replaced with a sea of concrete, glass-bottomed canals and imposing skyscrapers this is how London might have looked if ambitious architects had got their way. The strange skyline, could be compared with a 1960s science fiction film, shows what the capital might have become, were it not for strict planning legislation and worried campaigners. Using the latest digital technology including maps and models, artists have created these alternative views of the city for the exhibition Almost Lost: London's Buildings Loved And Loathed, which opens today. Alternative: Digital technology has been used to show how Soho would have looked today had a 1954 proposal to transform the area into a giant conservatory topped with 24-storey tower blocks had gone ahead . Skyline: This image created for a new English Heritage exhibition shows how the proposed Soho towers would have been visible from Trafalgar Square . Depicting the worst nightmare of many a NIMBY, the images reveal some of the most bizarre and brilliant development projects pitched for the city over the decades. The images provide a glimpse of what the city might have looked like if Brutalist concrete-based designs, popular between the 1950s and 1970s, had been granted planning permission. Among the most shocking is a 1954 scheme to replace Soho with a giant conservatory topped with 24-storey tower blocks, the district's maze of busy streets and alleyways swapped for landscaped gardens and glass-bottomed canals. In place of the famous Carnaby Street and Old Compton Street, visitors could have enjoyed a game of tennis on purpose-built courts, while famous old theatres would have made way for modern concert halls. The proposal, dreamed up by Geoffrey Jellico, Ove Arup and Edward Mills, was published in Architect and Building News although it never made it past the initial conceptual phase. Stark: Had a 1968 draft plan to redevelop Covent Garden gone ahead only St Martin In The Fields would have remained. The rest of the historic buildings would have been replaced with concrete structures . Unfamiliar: Designers behind this 1962 proposal for Piccadilly Circus thought it would improve the social, commercial and tourist values of the area . Many of the designs were attempting to re-work the city's landscape after many streets and landmarks were decimated by bombs during the Second World War. The way the city was used also changed after the conflict, with many people leaving London for the suburbs. City planners and designers were also keen to use the latest new materials available, and forms of architecture such as high-rise buildings. Polly Hudson, who curated the show as founder of The Building . Exploratory charitable trust, told The Independent: 'Jellico talks about the vibrant . area of Soho, but he doesn’t connect. 'It has taken us time to connect . the actual retention of that character and how it connects to people, . and buildings and layers of history. You can’t just knock something down . and retain the character.' Changing places: An aerial view of the proposed Carlton House Terrace, which sits alongside the Mall. Buckingham Palace can also be seen in this image, at the far end of the lake . Reality: Carlton House Terrace, as it is today. All of the images are on display as part of exhibition Almost Lost: London's Buildings Loved And Loathed . A decade later Sir Leslie Martin, designer of the Royal Festival Hall, proposed a plan to 'replan' Whitehall by demolishing virtually all the Edwardian and Victorian buildings around Parliament Square, including the Treasury, Foreign Office and War Office. Sir Leslie's scheme also proposed the creation of a new riverside square to the left of Big Ben with raised public restaurants facing the river. Elevated roads ran between this and the Thames with an underpass running beneath a raised river terrace in front of Parliament. The aim was to take separate traffic from pedestrains and address a 175% rise in traffic flow since 1945 and anticipated doubling by 1977. The exhibition also highlights a digital vision of how Covent Garden might have looked had a 1968 development plan gone ahead. Under the controversial proposal much of the south-western corner of Covent Garden would have been lost to concrete terracing, and apart from St Martin's in the Field, no other buildings in the area would have been retained. The local community rallied against plans to . demolish vast parts of the area led, somewhat intriguingly, . by one of the planners who had worked on the original demolition . proposals. New corridors of power: In 1964 Sire Leslie Martin, designer of the Royal Festival Hall, wanted to 'replan' Whitehall by demolishing virtually all the Edwardian and Victorian buildings around Parliament Square . Alongside the new digital aspect, the exhibition reveals . that without the actions of thousands of individuals and . organisations who campaigned to save . the threatened places, recorded those that were lost and helped drive . through protective legislation, much more of the city we know today . would be lost or irreparably altered. Alternative images of Kingsway, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Carlton House Terrace and Battersea Power Station can also be seen in the English Heritage exhibition at Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner, which runs until February. The exhibition also features an animated map of all buildings, scheduled monuments, conservation areas, registered parks, gardens and battlefields protected by the National Heritage List for England. A model of 1840’s Bloomsbury allows visitors to explore the area’s development over the decades using ‘Augmented Reality’ on iPads which are passed over the model and display digital maps of the place as it was and as it is now. Dr Simon Thurley, Chief Executive of English Heritage, said: 'Almost Lost tells the story of how lucky we have been. 'Thanks to the campaigning efforts of our predecessors we still have a beautiful city to enjoy. 'While we don’t face the wholesale destruction of the 1960s and 70s we still face problems today and the sort of technology we demonstrate in the exhibition is part of the modern armoury of conservation.' Brutal: Centre Point in London is one of the city's many examples of Brutalist architecture . Spawned from the modernist architectural movement, Brutalism is a style of architecture defined by concrete fortress-like buildings which flourished between the 1950s and mid-1970s. Brutalist architecture is loved and hated in equal measure, with plans to demolish the monolith structures often confronted with campaigns to save them. Examples of the typically linear style include London's Southbank Centre, which houses the Haywood Gallery, and the Grade-II listed Centre Point at the bottom of Tottenham Court Road. Initially the style, which often features an 'unfinished concrete' look was used for government buildings, low-rent housing and shopping centres to create functional structures at a low cost, but eventually designers adopted the look for other uses including arts centres and libraries. Critics of the style find it unappealing due to its 'cold' appearance, and many of the buildings have become symbols of urban decay, coated in graffiti. Despite this, Brutalism is appreciated by others, with many buildings having received Listed status. English architects Alison and Peter Smithson were believed to have coined the term in 1953, from the French béton brut, or 'raw concrete', although Swedish architect Hans Asplund clained he used the term in a conversation in 1950. The term became more widely used in 1966 when British architectural critic Reyner Banham used it in the title of his book, The New Brutalism: Ethic Or Aesthetic?","Alternative views of the capital on show at English Heritage exhibition .

America’s school children are falling even further behind other nations in the core subjects of reading, mathematics and science, according to a new study released this week. The worrying data, compiled as part of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), found that the academic performance of 15-year-olds in the U.S. has remained relatively flat in recent years, while other nations have experienced significant growth. With the results leave the U.S. floundering around the middle of the world’s sixty-five wealthiest nations, the top performers in all three subject areas were from Asia. The high achievers included Shanghai, one of three educational systems in China that participated, Singapore, the Republic of Korea and Japan. America's school children are falling even further behind other nations in core subjects such as reading, mathematics and science, according to a PISA study released this week . The under-performance of American 15-year-olds was most striking in maths, where the average score of 481 was well below the average of 494 . ‘We are not seeing any improvement in the U.S. … our ranking is slipping because other countries are improving,’ Jack Buckley, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), told CBS News. The United States’ under-performance was most striking in maths, where the average score of 481 was well below the OCED average of 494. Just nine percent of 15-year-olds scored in the top two levels of proficiency in math, compared with an average of 13 percent among industrialized nations and as high as 55 percent in Shanghai, 40 percent in Singapore, and 17 percent in Germany and Poland. U.S. students' strongest subject was reading, a score of 498 was two points above the OECD average but well behind the leading nations.

The average U.S. score in science was 497, slightly behind the OCED average of 501 left the country in 28th position out of 65 countries. For the first time three U.S. states - Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts - received separate scores. Massachusetts’s average scores were higher than the U.S. and OCED averages in all three subjects, and Connecticut’s average scores were higher than the overall averages in science and reading. Florida fared less well and was below both the U.S. and OCED averages on all three subjects. The National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, was quick to blame the poor results on the effects of poverty on American students. ‘The United States’ standings haven’t improved dramatically because we as a nation haven’t addressed the main cause of our mediocre PISA performance - the effects of poverty on students,’ said NEA President Dennis Van Roekel.

China's rise to world dominance is one of the ‘defining facts’ of our age and we must ‘like it or lump it’, David Cameron says today. In an article that risks angering other European leaders, he will offer to be Beijing’s strongest advocate in the West - saying no country is ‘more ready’ than Britain to welcome China to the ‘top table of global affairs’. The Prime Minister, who is leading Britain’s largest ever trade delegation to China, suggests the country is on the brink of becoming the leading global economic superpower and it is pointless to see it as a ‘threat’. Instead he says Britain wants to ‘forge a dialogue of mutual respect and understanding’ and calls on other countries to do the same. Supporter: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured centre with the British trade delegation visiting China, says trade with China is an opportunity and not a threat . Starting a three-day visit to China, the Prime Minister will propose a free trade deal between the EU and China -  a suggestion which will infuriate many other European leaders. While all are keen to boost trade with Beijing, there are fears that a full-scale free trade arrangement would lead to China flooding the West with cheap goods, often ripped off from Western manufacturers. Writing in a Chinese magazine, Mr Cameron insists the country’s unstoppable transformation ‘is one of the defining facts of our lifetime’. He writes: ‘Last year China became the world’s largest trading nation. ‘Next year China is set to become the world’s largest importer of goods and later this century it will become the world’s biggest economy.’ ‘We should be clear that there is a genuine choice for every country over how to respond to this growing openness and success. ‘They can choose to see China’s rise as a threat or an opportunity. They can protect their markets from China or open their markets to China. They can try and shut China out – or welcome China as a partner at the top table of global affairs. ‘Britain’s answer is clear. We want to . see China succeed. Whether it is welcoming China’s investment in our . nuclear energy sector, or creating a western hub for the renminbi in the . City of London, we believe that the right way forward is openness, . dialogue, trade and investment; working together for mutual benefit not . against each other in a zero-sum game.’ New trade: The Prime Minister, pictured with the largest British trade delegation to ever visit the country, will pledge his support to opening up trade between China and the EU . China’s rise is happening at ‘100 times the scale and ten times the speed of Britain’s own urbanisation two centuries ago’, he adds. Mr Cameron will offer the Chinese a ‘lasting friendship that can become a blueprint for future co-operation between our countries: a partnership for growth and reform that can help to deliver the Chinese dream – and long-term prosperity for Britain too’. The Prime Minister last visited China in November 2010, but relations were plunged into the deep freeze when he met the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, in 2012. He has apparently since been forgiven by Beijing after making clear Britain does not support Tibetan independence, coupled with indications from Downing Street that he has no plans for a further meeting. His gushing magazine article goes on to welcome Chinese reforms to ‘free its markets and open them up to foreign participation’. He writes: ‘There is no greater advocate . of that economic openness than Britain and no better partner for China . as it opens to the world. ‘Put simply, there is no country in the . Western world more open to Chinese investment, more able to meet the . demands of Chinese consumers, or more willing to make the case for . economic openness in the G8, the G20 and the European Union. And there . is no country more ready to forge a dialogue of mutual respect and . understanding.’ Meeting: David Cameron will meet with China's Premier Li Keqiang to discuss a trade agreement between the EU and China . The Prime Minister - who is scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu during his trip - will suggest that a free trade deal between the EU and China would unleash tens of billions to the European and Chinese economies. Today, at a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, the Prime Minister will make clear he is ready to throw his political weight behind an agreement to liberalise trade between China and the EU - the world’s largest trading bloc and China’s biggest trading partner. Such a deal would deliver a sizeable economic prize with initial economic analysis suggesting it could be worth up to £1.8bn every year to the UK economy alone, he says. His focus on the deal also underlines his determination to keep Britain inside a reformed EU - a position which risks angering some hardline Eurosceptic Tories. ‘Britain is uniquely placed to make the case for deepening the European Union’s trade and investment relationship with China. ‘Building on the recent launch of EU-China negotiations on investment, and on China’s continued commitment to economic reform, I now want to set a new long-term goal of an ambitious and comprehensive EU-China Free Trade Agreement. And as I have on the EU-US deal, so I will put my full political weight behind such a deal which could be worth tens of billions of dollars every year,’ he adds. The Government has already started making the case for the deal, raising it with European partners, including at a summit in Vilnius last week, officials say. The Government believes that a free trade deal would eliminate tariffs in 20 key sectors and would save UK exporters approx $1bn a year. The UK has significant strengths in these high tariff areas, which include vehicles, pharmaceutical, mechanical and electrical goods, and which together account for 36 per cent of UK exports to China. Inward investment into Britain from China will get a further boost on the trip when the Chinese Ministry responsible for authorising all major overseas investments signs a landmark deal backing Chinese companies to invest in the UK, as well as supporting more investment from British companies into China. This will be the first deal of its kind between China and a European partner. Mr Cameron is also promising to speed up the process for patents so that businesses concerned about the economic impact of intellectual property infringement in China, estimated to cost from tens of millions to several billion pounds. In 2012, 1 in 4 UK businesses were put off doing business overseas due to concerns around intellectual property theft. The Prime Minister will today visit Jaguar Land Rover’s training academy in Beijing to mark its official opening as the firm sign sa new agreement to provide 100,000 cars to the National Sales Company in China over the next year, demonstrating the value of the UK market to British companies. Among more than 100 business figures accompanying the PM are executives from Jaguar Land Rover, Royal Dutch Shell, GlaxoSmithKline, TalkTalk and the football Premier League, as well as many smaller companies and half a dozen Government ministers. Culture Secretary Maria Miller will push British media and cultural exports, while Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will seek to do a series of deals in food and agriculture. Jeremy Hunt will hold talks on marketing health services to China’s government. Although Britain is still well behind some other European nations in terms of trade with China, in the first six months of the year exports jumped 20 per cent, while inward investment has climbed to a 30-year high over the last 18 months.","Prime Minister is leading Britain's largest ever trade delegation to China .

Posing in beachwear at a sun-soaked South American resort, they look like ordinary British holidaymakers rather than the hostages of a drug baron. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, claim they were kidnapped in Ibiza and threatened at gunpoint by a Colombian gang who told them to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru. But the two face difficult questions after photographs emerged of them posing on a balcony and with beers on a beach days before they were arrested at Lima airport. Scroll down for video . Carefree: Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly happily pose on a balcony in Peru where they are accused of smuggling cocaine . The women claim they were told to take photographs of themselves smiling at various tourist spots in Lima to convince border control officers and hotel staff that they were ordinary travellers. Miss Reid, from Glasgow, says Colombian henchmen who watched their every move even told her she was ‘not smiling enough’ as they photographed themselves on the Inca Trail in the Andes. But detectives in Lima say their story is ‘illogical’ and prosecutors are likely to use the pictures to claim they were offered cash and a luxury holiday to Peru in return for smuggling cocaine. Miss Connolly, from Northern Ireland, has admitted that they were flown first class to Lima. It was also claimed yesterday that the women were seen going on a huge spending spree there. Drinks all round: Michaella and Mellisa pose with beers in the sun in Peru where they are now being held and face years in jail . Melissa’s father William Reid, 53, who flew to Peru to be with his daughter as she faces several years in jail, admitted the photographs were ambiguous. He said: ‘I want to know who took that picture of them on their balcony. Was it taken by a third person or by a minder, and who was drinking the beer? ‘That isn’t Melissa’s beer in the photo because I have never in my entire life seen her drink beer. 'She drinks a lot of water and, if she is drinking, it would be vodka.’ Michaella McCollum Connolly (left) and Melissa Reid (right) photographed after they were caught allegedly with 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to Madrid .

Reid, a manager at a gas company, said: ‘I believe the trip to the . beach was part of the set-up – that they asked them to smile to build up . a portrayal of them as happy holidaymakers. ‘Melissa . said they said they had been told by the men that they weren’t smiling . enough in the pictures and they told them to look happier.

A man accused of murdering his 11-month-old son blamed his dog for causing the child's death, a court heard. Michael Beaumont, 29, a part-time gardener, claimed his son, Kadan, was ‘flipped over’ by Staffordshire terrier Mia before banging his head on the garden steps. But the prosecution at Sheffield Crown Court said the head injuries, which saw Kadan die in hospital, were caused by Beaumont hours before he called an ambulance. Michael Beaumont (right) blamed his dog for causing the death of his 11-month-old son, Kadan (left) He told the court yesterday: ‘I saw . Mia bang into him. It was really fast. I just remember Mia hitting the . back of him and hitting his head on the step. He landed on the back of . his head. ‘Kadan went over himself and did a back somersault and landed on his back on the concrete just below the bottom step.’ The court heard Beaumont sent a photo of his son’s injuries to the child’s mother, Helen Barnes, 28, while she was at work. A . message with the picture said: ‘Look at my head mummy. Naughty Mia . knocked me down the steps in the garden. I cut my neck as well. Don’t . worry, daddy chased her round the garden and slapped her.’ The . father told the same story to his neighbours. One said Kadan ‘looked as . though he had been beaten up by Mike Tyson’, but the parents did not . seek medical attention until the next day. Kadan . died in Sheffield Children’s Hospital on September 28, 2011 where . doctors found he had two recent fractures of the skull, bleeding in his . eyes and on the surface of the brain as well as multiple bruises to his . head and face. Prosecutor Robert Smith QC said . the dog story was untrue and Kadan’s death was ‘caused by someone . striking him or throwing him against some surface shortly before the . emergency services were called’. Beaumont, . who has a six-year-old son from a previous relationship, told the jury . he was ‘right happy’ when Barnes became pregnant with Kadan. The child's mother, Helen Barnes, 28, denies allowing the death of a child and cruelty to an under-16 . The court heard that when Kadan was born Beaumont had shared duties with the baby’s mother and also looked after her five-year-old son when she returned to work as a teaching assistant. Asked if he had any experience of looking after babies before Kadan, Beaumont said: ‘I did, but not a right lot.’ Beaumont said Kadan’s fatal injuries were sustained as he was playing with the rabbits in the garden of the couple’s home at Chapel Street, Hoyland Common, Barnsley, and then crawled up the two steps on a path and stood up. Beaumont blamed his Staffordshire terrier, Mia (not pictured), for killing his 11-month-old son, Kadan . ‘He turned round and all I can remember, I looked up at the last minute and saw Mia bang into him,’ he said. But the prosecution said Kadan was subject to regular violence from an early age and was taken to a GP when he was seven weeks old after coughing up blood. A week later he was taken to hospital with a ‘cauliflower’ ear which a doctor suspected may have been caused by a punch. When interviewed after Kadan’s death, Ms Barnes told police she had lifted Kadan over her shoulder two days previously and the baby ‘headbutted’ her. But experts told the court much more force would have been required. The couple claimed Kadan also suffered bruising to his head two weeks previously when he fell out of a high chair in the kitchen as Beaumont fed him. Mr Smith said the parents did not seek medical attention for Kadan because they were ‘fearful’ of the consequences. ‘Beaumont had deliberately inflicted those injuries to his son and falsely claimed to Barnes that the dog had been responsible,’ he said. ‘She had no excuse as a teaching assistant and mother for failing to take action to investigate those serious injuries and protect him from further abuse at the hands of Michael Beaumont.’ The court heard that just a few weeks previously Beaumont had ‘slammed’ his son down on a neighbour’s hard kitchen floor and said he was ‘stressed out and his son had to learn’. Asked by Bryan Cox QC, defending, if he had done anything to injure Kadan, Beaumont said: ‘No. I tried to help him. I loved him and I miss him. I loved all my children very much.’ Beaumont denies murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. Barnes denies allowing the death of a child and cruelty to a person under-16. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Michael Beaumont, 29, said his son, Kadan, was 'flipped over' by Staffordshire terrier and denies murder .

David Cameron has brokered a bizarre deal which will see China spend millions of pounds importing semen and trotters from British pigs. Downing Street said the semen deal agreement, which will be worth £45 million to UK firms, indicated it was doing all it could to ensure that all types of businesses reap the rewards from our relationship with China. China is home to half of the world's pigs, and its Communist leaders are apparently keen to improve the quality of its herds since the Chinese rely on pork for much of their protein intake. Trade: Britain has secured agreement from China to supply exports of pig semen for breeders, in a deal which could be worth as much as £45 million to the UK industry . China wants to increase the efficiency of its production, whilst minimising the environmental impact.It is hoped that the UK industry can play an important role in helping China achieve greater efficiency through the provision of high quality genetic stock. Britain is lobbying Beijing to also be allowed to export pig trotters, which are a waste product in the UK pork industry but are widely eaten by Chinese diners. Exports of trotters could be worth as much as £7.5 million a year to the industry in Britain. The first exports of porcine semen will commence in the first quarter of 2014. Prime Minister David Cameron enjoyed tea at the home of the Chinese author and poet Du Fu in Chengdu today by guides Jia Lan (left) and Wang Yu, as part of his three day visit to China . A Downing Street spokesman said: 'We're doing all we can to ensure that businesses up and down the country reap the rewards from our relationship with China. And that includes our pig farmers. 'This new deal to export pig semen will be worth £45 million to UK firms and means Britain's best pigs will help sustain the largest pig population in the world. 'And we're not stopping there - we're talking to the Chinese about serving up pigs trotters on Beijing's finest dining tables. 'That would be a real win-win - a multimillion-pound boost for Britain and a gastronomic treat for Chinese diners.' The Prime Minister has used the trip to strike a series of deals between the UK and China . Four Artificial Insemination (AI) centres based in England and North are expected to start exporting in the New Year. They are based in England and Northern Ireland. UK semen will be key to help the Chinese improve their pig production and make the industry more productive in the long term. The protocol for porcine semen agreed with the Chinese will allow the shipment of both fresh and frozen semen to China. It is the latest in a string of deals struck between Britain and China during Mr Cameron's three-day trade visit this week.","Prime Minister seals pig semen agreement with China worth £45million .

Little is known about Tips4jesus bar an Instagram page, tag-lined ¿doing the lord¿s work one tip at a time,¿ where a series of photographs have been posted since September of receipts bearing large gratuities . To begin with many people – especially waiters and waitresses - questioned the authenticity of the mega-tips which have so far ranged in size from $500 to $10,000. It’s every server’s dream to have some super generous customer leave an enormous tip for a job well done and now one bartender has come forward to confirm that Tips4jesus is the real deal. One of the happy servers photographed smiling on the Tips4jesus Instagram page is Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, who was lucky enough to pick up a $7,000 tip for a $215 bar tab. Schulz recently confirmed to local blog Damn Arbor that the tip was real and that he served the mysterious Tip4jesus in September when he and his entourage were in town for the Notre Dame versus Michigan game. Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, was lucky enough to pick up a $7,000 tip for a $215 bar tab, he describes Tip4jesus as 'friendly and polite' Tips4jesus may give good tip but he also has expensive tastes as they receipt featuring gimlets at over $100 a pop goes to show .

He described Tips4jesus as friendly, polite, nice and a pleasure to serve and that he was told he would be taken care of the staff at the end of the night. Schultz had expectations that perhaps a $50 tip might be in the offing, but was flabbergasted when Tips4jesus reached for his black American Express card and tipped an amazing $7,000.

A British mother was accused of abducting her two daughters after U.S. immigration officials refused to believe the family were related... because they have different surnames. Katie Percival, 13, was travelling with her mother Victoria Turner, who is divorced and uses a different surname. When they landed at  New York's JFK Airport, Ms Turner presented her divorce papers, birth certificates for Katie and her sister, her previous passport with the surname Percival and her proof of marriage. Victoria Turner, right, was accused by U.S. border officials of abducting her daughters Katie, pictured, and Ella Percival because she had a different surname to the children . But officials demanded a letter from the girls' father giving permission for them to be taken abroad, and even threatened to send them back before finally relenting. Katie, of Bromley in Kent, has now launched an online petition urging the Home Office to put the names of both parents (where known) on the passports of under 18s. Her mother, Ms Turner, is Katie’s main carer after she and Katie’s father divorced 11 years ago. But because of the divorce she has a different surname to Katie. When the pair, who were travelling with Katie's younger sister 12-year-old Ella, where stopped in June the border officials refused to believe the trio were related. Katie, 13, has launched an online petition calling on the Home Office to change the rules and include the names of both parents on a child's passport . Katie said: 'I was at JFK airport in the USA with my family. The immigration officer looked at my mum’s passport, then my sister’s. 'He looked up and said: ""You have different surnames, where’s the father?"" 'My mum said that he was in England. He then asked for proof that my mum wasn’t abducting us. 'I was shocked. My mum showed him her divorce papers, our birth certificates, her previous passport with our surname and her proof of marriage. 'He wasn’t interested and said that if we were entering the USA we would need a written letter from our dad giving permission for my mum to take us abroad. 'He even threatened to send us home. I was staggered. We were eventually allowed through, but it marred the start of our holiday and is something I will not forget.' Katie came up the idea for a petition in late October when she was attending an event run by Girlguiding UK and change.org. The event was to mark the launch of Go For It - Be The Change, an activity pack written by young members of Girlguiding struck by the lack of female representation in government. Katie added: 'The event was showing us how to make change for women. 'They were showing us how we could make petitions for women’s rights. 'When I got home I told mum my idea. 'I remember in America it had been really scary, the immigration officer kept looking at us and questioning if we were mum’s daughters. 'I really think that this should happen. It is a really big issue if you think about it.' Katie Percival has urged the Home Office to alter the rules and add the names of both parents, where known, to the passports of under 18s. Her petition entitled Put The Names Of BOTH Parents On The Passports Of Under 18s, to the Home Office, states: 'They . now say that 50 per cent of marriages end in divorce, and the number keeps . rising. So what happens to the children? They tend to take their . father’s last name, regardless of which parent they live with. 'The . majority of children with divorced parents live with the mother, for a . variety of reasons. 'HOWEVER, if the mother wants to take the children . abroad for a holiday, she has to seek written permission from the father . to be allowed permission. 'What . happens if the mother doesn’t have any contact with the father or he . refuses to give permission? Why should the main carer of the child have . to seek written permission from a secondary carer to take their child on . holiday? 'My parents are . divorced and we have this problem 90% of the time. So I have started . this petition to raise awareness of this issue. There needs to be a . sense of equality in this aspect of parenting. 'Having . the names of both parents (where known) on passports of under 18s would . alleviate this problem and save a great deal of stress for many . families.

The engineer who was at the controls during a deadly New York train crash fell asleep, sources from the investigation claimed today. William Rockefeller Jr, a 46-year-old operator with an unblemished record in his 20-year Metro-North career, told investigators after the crash that he had 'zoned out'. The Metro-North Railroad commuter train was barreling down the track at 82mph before it derailed on Sunday along a sharp curve where the speed limit is 30mph. Four passengers died and 67 were injured. Scroll down for video . The locomotive of the Metro-North train which derailed on Sunday is righted on the tracks by emergency crews on Monday . The warped tracks after a commuter train derailed on Sunday killing 4 passengers and injuring dozens more . Sources from the train crash investigation revealed that engineer William Rockefeller (pictured) admitted that he 'dozed off' seconds before the Metro-North train entered a 30mph curve at 82mph in New York City . According to the New York Post, Rockefeller 'was just somehow inattentive' and only jolted into action when a whistle blew to warn him of how fast the train was traveling. The brakes were slammed - but it was too late to prevent disaster. Some carriages rolled several times throwing people from them. Three people were found dead outside the train and one person inside. The train came to a stop on the banks of the Harlem River. The NTSB investigation has revealed that six seconds before the derailment, the throttle went idle and one second later, the brakes dropped from 120PSI on the pressure gauge to zero. Following the crash, Rockefeller was tested for drugs and alcohol but it is believed that neither was found in his system. His cellphone has been taken for forensic analysis but it also not believed to have been a factor in the crash. Cranes were brought in to retrieve the train carriages several of which rolled several times during the horrific collision . Emergency crews worked through the night on Monday to return the train carriages to the tracks so it could be taken off for a full inspection . A Metro-North passenger train lays on its side after derailing on Sunday in the Bronx borough of New York City leaving four people dead . Sources told DNAInfo that the engineer virtually admitted that he dozed off as the train barreled at 82mph down a 70mph stretch to the 30mph zone. There was no immediate reasons given as to why Rockefeller drifted off, with no suggestions he had been overworked or out late the previous night. The train engineer was released from hospital on Monday night after sustaining minor injuries in the crash. He is said to be thoroughly traumatized by the horrific crash and cooperating with the investigation. 'He's a sincere human being with an impeccable record that I know of. He's diligent and competent,' Anthony Bottalico, executive director of the rail employees union said. Rockefeller has been an engineer for about 11 years and a Metro-North employee for about 20 years, he said. The lead car in the Metro-North train derailment is pulled from the marsh in the Bronx borough of New York . The revelation that the commuter train, which was traveling from Poughkeepsie to New York City, derailed while barreling into a sharp curve at nearly three times the speed limit is fueling questions about whether automated crash-avoidance technology could have prevented the carnage. Safety officials have championed what's known as positive train control technology for decades but the railroad industry has sought to postpone having to install it because of the high cost and technological issues. Investigators haven't yet determined whether the weekend wreck, which killed four people and injured more than 60 others, was the result of human error or mechanical trouble. But some safety experts said the tragedy might not have happened if Metro-North Railroad had the technology, and a senator said the derailment underscored the need for it. 'This incident, if anything, heightens the importance of additional safety measures, like that one,' said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, which also is served by Metro-North. 'I'd be very loath to be more flexible or grant more time.' Federal authorities began righting the cars on Monday morning as they started an exhaustive investigation into what caused a Metro-North commuter train rounding a riverside curve to derail, killing four people . The train was going 82 mph as it entered a 30 mph turn Sunday morning and ran off the track, National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener said on Monday. He cited information extracted from the train's two data recorders; investigators also began interviewing the train's crew. The speed stunned officials - 'I gulped,' said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, (Democrat-New York). Governor Andrew Cuomo said the NTSB findings make it clear 'extreme speed was a central cause' of the derailment and vowed to 'make sure any responsible parties are held accountable' after investigators determine why the train was going so fast. 'At this point in time, we can't tell' whether the answer is faulty brakes or a human mistake, Weener said. Weener sketched a scenario suggesting that the throttle was let up and the brakes were fully applied way too late to stave off the crash. He said the throttle went to idle six seconds before the derailed train came to a complete stop - 'very late in the game' for a train going that fast - and the brakes were fully engaged five seconds before the train stopped. It takes about a quarter-mile to a half-mile to stop a train going 82 mph, according to Kevin Thompson, a Federal Railroad Administration spokesman. First responders work the scene of a derailment of a Metro-North passenger train. The train was traveling at 82mph when it went into a 30mph curve sending the carriages careening off the tracks . Investigators are not aware of any problems with the brakes during the nine stops the train made before the derailment, Mr Weener said. Positive train control, or PTC, is designed to forestall the human errors that cause about 40 per cent of train accidents, and uses GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding, derailing or going the wrong way. The transportation safety board has urged railroads to install PTC in some form since 1970, and after a 2005 head-on collision killed 25 people near Los Angeles, Congress in 2008 ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by December 2015. Metro-North has taken steps toward acquiring it but, like many rail lines, has advocated for a few more years to implement a costly system that railroads say presents technological and other hurdles. Grady Cothen, a former FRA safety official, said a PTC system would have prevented Sunday's crash if the brakes were working normally. And Steve Ditmeyer, a former FRA official who teaches at Michigan State University, said the technology would have monitored the brakes and would not have allowed the train to exceed the speed limit. James Lovell, 58, a married father-of-four was killed in Sunday morning's Metro-North derailment as the engineer made his way into New York City to work on the Rockefeller Christmas tree lighting . Donna Smith (pictured left), a paralegal, was one of the four people killed in the horrific train crash on Sunday in New York City. Nurse Kisook Ahn, 35, (pictured right) was also died . 'A properly installed PTC system would have prevented this train from crashing,' he said. 'If the engineer would not have taken control of slowing the train down, the PTC system would have.' The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs Metro-North, began planning for a PTC system as soon as the law was put into effect, spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said. After some early-stage work such as buying radio frequencies, the MTA awarded $428 million in contracts in September to develop the system for Metro-North and its sister Long Island Rail Road. But the MTA has advocated for an extension to 2018, saying it's difficult to install such a system across more than 1,000 rail cars and 1,200 miles of track. 'It's not a simple, off-the-shelf solution,' Anders said on Monday. On Sunday, the train was about half full, with about 150 people aboard, when it ran off the rails while rounding a bend where the Harlem and Hudson rivers meet. The lead car landed inches from the water. The dead were identified as Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh; James G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring; James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; and Kisook Ahn, 35, of Queens. Some of the injured remained hospitalized Monday, including seven in intensive care at one hospital and two patients in critical condition at another. The train was configured with its locomotive in the back instead of the front. Weener said that is common, and a train's brakes work the same way no matter where the locomotive is located. Ditmeyer said the locomotive's location has virtually no effect on train safety. Still, some people feel the configuration provides less protection for passengers because if the train hits something, there's no locomotive in front to absorb the blow, said Bill Henderson, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA, a riders' advocacy group. The derailment came amid a troubled year for Metro-North, and marked the first time in the railroad's 31-year history that a passenger was killed in an accident. In May, a train derailed in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and was struck by a train coming in the opposite direction, injuring 73 passengers, two engineers and a conductor. In July, a freight train full of garbage derailed near the site of Sunday's wreck.","William Rockefeller, 46, told .

A 40 per cent stake in Eurostar has been put up for grabs by the Government as part of plans to privatise £20 billion of financial and corporate assets by 2020. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander is expected to announce the plans for the cross channel rail operator today, as part of the new national infrastructure plan (NIP). The plans will outline more than £375 billion of planned public and private investments to 2030 and beyond. A 40 per cent stake in Eurostar has been put up for grabs by the Government as part of plans to privatise £20 billion of financial and corporate assets by 2020 . A Government guarantee could also support finance for the development of a new nuclear power station at Wylfa on Anglesey . Ministers have also been given a boost by major players from the insurance industry, who have also announced plans to invest £25 billion in UK infrastructure projects over the next five years. The plans set out today include a new target for selling off financial assets, doubling the amount from £10 billion to £20 billion including the shareholding in the cross-channel train operator. It comes weeks after the Government faced heavy criticism for undervaluing Royal Mail during its flotation. Last month Eurostar revealed it had seen an increase passenger numbers and revenue compared with last summer. Sales revenue for the period July-September 2013 reached £207 million - a 10 per cent increase on the same period last year - and passenger numbers in summer 2013 rose 5 per cent to 2.7 million. The planned infrastructure investment has increased from £309 billion last year to more than £375 billion, with 291 of the 646 projects and programmes already under construction. Insurers Legal and General, Prudential, Aviva, Standard Life, Friends Life and Scottish Widows have announced plans to invest in infrastructure. This follows changes in European rules pushed for by the UK which incentivise investment in a wider range of assets. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander will unveil the NIP today, alongside Commercial Secretary and former London Olympics chief Lord Deighton. Mr Alexander will say: 'The announcement today that six major insurers will invest £25 billion over the next five years is a massive vote of confidence in the UK economy. 'It supports the wider £100 billion public investment to rebuild Britain over the next seven years that I announced at the Spending Round 2013. Underground, overground, onshore, offshore, wired or wireless, tarmac or train track. You name it, we're building it right now. 'This is great news for the people of the UK because after years of neglect, the UK's energy, road, rail, flood defence, communications and water infrastructure needs renewal. 'It will boost the UK economy creating jobs and making it easier to do business. It will also make the UK a better place to live for everyone who calls it their home.' Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today . programme this morning, Mr Alexander declined to comment on other . potential sell-offs suggested to him – including the Royal Mint and the . Met Office - in addition to the Eurostar. He said: ‘What I’m setting out today is an ambition with some examples of things that we could sell.’ Asked . about plans to cut funding for renewable energy sources, including . on-shire wind farms, which he said 'are a very important part of meeting . our energy needs', and solar power, he said: 'I believe passionately in . meeting this country’s obligations to tackle climate change.' But Mr Alexander added that he wants Britain to meet its climate targets 'in the most cost effective way we can'. Association of British Insurers director general Otto Thoresen said: 'Insurers have a key role to play in contributing to the UK's economic growth, as providers of long-term capital investment. Providing capital for infrastructure projects will help drive a competitive, healthy and resilient UK economy.' The decision to drop plans to toll the upgraded A14 has been welcomed by campaigners and follows David Cameron's acknowledgement of the 'strong feelings' about the proposal in East Anglia. RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: 'Piecemeal tolling that would raise little money but create a lot of aggravation and delay was always going to be a hard sell and not the best advert for pay-as-you-go driving.' At Prime Minister's Questions last week, Mr Cameron said: 'I am well aware of the strong feelings in Suffolk about this issue and I have been approached about it by many Members of Parliament. 'I believe that road tolls can play an important part in providing new road capacity and it is important that we find ways to pay for road capacity, but I also understand the concerns about this individual case.' Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: 'With the country facing a cost-of-living crisis we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs, boost living standards and strengthen our economy for the long term. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander will unveil the NIP today, alongside Commercial Secretary and former London Olympics chief Lord Deighton . 'But for the last three-and-a-half years the Government's record on infrastructure has been one of complete failure. The ONS says that infrastructure work is down 3.7 per cent in the last year and fell by 10 per centin 2012. And in the spending review the Government set out plans to cut capital investment even further in real terms in 2015/16. 'Scheme after scheme has been announced to great fanfare but then little actually delivered. Yet another announcement from ministers about possible future investment will do little to reassure business that warm words will finally translate into diggers in the ground.' Prudential's group chief executive Tidjane Thiam said: 'As a major long-term investor in the UK, Prudential is pleased to commit to harness our financial strength for the benefit of the UK economy. 'This initiative will help achieve sustainable economic growth. We are already a significant player in infrastructure investment in the UK with more than £40 billion invested across sectors, including property. 'Creating the conditions for increased investment in infrastructure from Prudential and the insurance industry has been a key concern of mine as chairman of the ABI (Association of British Insurers). 'We as an industry worked very hard to ensure a good outcome to Solvency II and we recently welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations in Brussels last month, which among other improvements, has made it more likely that insurers can continue to invest in infrastructure. 'It will be important to ensure that this progress is not jeopardised as Solvency II moves to the implementation stage.'","Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander will announce plans today .

The kamikaze dogs were fitted with explosives and taught to carry them to tanks, armoured vehicles and other targets. The use of these dogs in battle was first approved in 1924 and continued into the 1990swith special training to ensure they ran to their deaths in front of enemy tanks. Trained: Pictures have emerged showing how Stalin's 'canine killers' were deployed in the Second World War against Nazi tanks . Kitted out: The kamikaze dogs were fitted with explosives and taught to carry them to tanks, armoured vehicles and other targets . Battle: The use of dogs in battle was first approved in 1924 and continued into the 1990s, it is understood, with special training to ensure the dogs ran to the deaths in front of enemy tanks . Military expert Yuri Veremeyev said: 'The Red Army already had the experience of using dogs for a whole number of tasks, from security to taking the wounded from battlefields to delivering messages and moving arms and food to the front line. 'So the next suggestion was to try and use dogs as delivery agents of mines to the enemy's tanks.' Initially, the aim was for the dog to put the bomb in position, biting on a cord to release it, or by remote control. However, in the heat of battle the . frightened animals often failed to release the bomb and - faced with the . desperate need to counter German forces surging east - the bombs were . fitted to the dog and exploded on impact with the target, killing the . dog. Control: The dogs were controlled by hunger - food was put under the tanks . 'The first experiments were made with mines packed inside thick canvas packs that were put on dogs' backs,' said Veremeyev. 'Inside the pack were two bags, each . with 6 kg of TNT. There was also a wooden saddle on top of the dog's . back, carrying explosives and disintegrating devices, with the explosive . varying depending on the task - either it was the delayed action one, . or the one with the pointing target sensor. 'There was also a parachute like lock which the dog could pull in order to release the bag. 'The . idea was to train the dogs to the extent of them being able to run . towards the tank, pause in the relatively safe zone, get as close as it . was possible to the tank, pull the cord, let the bag go - and run back. 'The . aim was to use such dogs for multiple purposes, like enemy's arms and . fuel storehouse destruction, or any other immobile objects destruction. 'The . task proved to be too long to achieve in the war conditions - the dogs . managed to learn what they needed to do, but as soon as they were put in . real battlefield conditions they became confused, and ran away or . quickly returned to their masters. 'There was one famous dog called Inga . that was like a genius during training with carrying the explosives, . but even that dog didn't manage to do a real mission. The first group of . dogs was trained for about six months.' Faced with this failure, the Soviet handlers developed the idea of 'disposable dogs', he said. 'It . died during the explosion which meant a slight change in the mine bag . construction so that a dog could not remove it during its mission. 'The . explosives were just the same, two sets 6 kg of TNT each, with 12 kg . enough to explode the bottom of the tank.' The chassis was seen as the . most vulnerable part of the tank. He revealed secrets of the Soviet training. 'The Soviet army used of the most basic instincts - hunger. 'The dogs were kept without food for a while in cages, then hot food was cooked and put underneath the tanks. 'Attracted . by its smell, dogs ran under the tanks and quite soon they learned that . this was the only place where they could get the food. 'Very soon they were taught to get under the tanks when engines were on and during the battle field sounds imitation. ' Mission: Initially, the aim was for the dog to put the bomb in position, biting on a cord to release it, or by remote control . Conflict: In the heat of battle the frightened animals often failed to release the bomb . Discredit: The Nazis saw the use of dogs as a desperate measure by Stalin and sought to discredit the technique for propaganda purposes claiming the Soviets were sending dogs instead of men into battle . Troubled times: This photo from the Battle of Kursk shows a German Panzer VI Tiger between Bielgorod and Orel in July 1943 . While there were successes from the use of dogs, there were also reports of singular battlefield failures, not least because the Soviets had trained them on diesel-powered tanks, while the Germans used gasoline engines. Faced with the unfamiliar smell the soldier dogs became confused. An handler wrote on 16 October 1941: 'Most of the dogs refuse to work and aim to jump back inside the trench.' Some exploded their bombs on the Soviet side by darting for cover in Russian trenches, while others were shot as they retreated from their task. 'Nine dogs ran to the targets, but then got scared by explosions around them and tried to hide' said the report. 'Three of them exploded, two were never found, the rest had to be destroyed by us because they were running back to us.' Approval: The initial approval for their use came in 1924 from the Revolutionary Military Council of the Soviet Union.

There is also evidence from the KKVD - precursor to the KGB - that the use of 'anti-tank dogs' sapped morale among soldiers. One conscript complained:  'There are enough people being destroyed.

The Red Army recruited circus trainers and hunters to school their new canine conscripts. It was in 1935 that 'anti-mine dog units' were officially included in the Soviet Army, and pictures show them in 1938 parading on Red Square. In 1941 the first dogs deployed by Stalin at the frontline. There were 30 dogs and 40 trainers. It didn't take long for the Germans to shoot three dogs and take possession of the device used to carry the bombs. The Nazis saw the use of dogs as a desperate measure by Stalin and sought to discredit the technique for propaganda purposes claiming the Soviets were sending dogs instead of men into battle. Claims vary over the effectiveness of the dogs, but there is documentary evidence of successes, for example at the Battle of Kursk when 16 dogs disabled 12 German tanks.","Stalin's 'canine killers' were deployed in WW2 against Nazi tanks .

Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC, said anyone posting remarks about a particular case online could be in contempt of court . Facebook and Twitter users have been warned they could be breaking the law by posting online comments about on-going court cases. The Government’s chief legal officer, Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC, said anyone posting remarks about a particular case online could be in contempt of court. While court cases are in progress, newspapers and other media organisations are required to comply with reporting rules - so the case is fair. Information about defendants from outside court, as well as comments on innocence and guilt, are banned. Anyone who breaks them can be hauled before a judge, charged and even jailed. In future, warnings on particular cases sent to media will be published on Twitter by the Attorney General’s Office - so the wider public are aware of the dangers of passing comment in public. Mr Grieve said the advisory notices, which have previously been issued only to print and broadcast media outlets on a ‘not for publication’ basis, are designed to make sure that fair trials take place. Mr Grieve said: ‘Blogs and social media sites like Twitter and Facebook mean that individuals can now reach thousands of people with a single tweet or post. ‘This is an exciting prospect, but it can pose certain challenges to the criminal justice system. ‘In days gone by, it was only the mainstream media that had the opportunity to bring information relating to a court case to such a large group of people that it could put a court case at risk. In future, warnings on particular cases sent to media will be published on Twitter by the Attorney General's Office - so the wider public are aware of the dangers of passing comment in public . ‘That is no longer the case and is why I have decided to publish the advisories that I have previously only issued to the media. ‘This is not about telling people what they can or cannot talk about on social media - quite the opposite in fact, it’s designed to help facilitate commentary in a lawful way. ‘I hope that by making this information available to the public at large, we can help stop people from inadvertently breaking the law, and make sure that cases are tried on the evidence, not what people have found online.’ The advisories will be published on the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) section of the gov.uk website and also through the AGO’s twitter feed - @AGO-UK.","Attorney General said online posts could be in contempt of court .

By using any combination of browser history, cookies or phishing attacks, hackers can easily take over the exchange’s website, said a security expert who claims hackers can control the site using basic tools. Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of High-Bridge Tech, a Switzerland-based technology security firm, detailed to the New York Daily News how he notified NASDAQ of the vulnerability multiple times only to be ignored. Here a glitch, there a hack: Trading on the NASDAQ Market has been halted in the past for glitches, now the exchange's website has been hacked - in only 10 minutes . A good hacker can get full access to Nasdaq.com in a couple of days with the ability to do almost whatever he wants, such as push an announcement that Facebook shares have dropped 90% [which] could cause havoc on the stock exchange,’ Mr Kolochenko told the Daily News. Calling it ‘quite frightening,’ Mr Kolochenko boasted to the paper that he was able to hack into Nasdaq.com in only 10 minutes – armed with only the Firefox web browser. All it was took was inputting random HTML code into the site’s script to see if it would be detected before displaying on the site, he further explained. Once it wasn’t, the security expert knew he had found a problem. Hackers can use codes to display just about anything on any website, including ‘a fake Web form demanding credit card numbers and other personal information or to inject malware to infect PC users,’ Mr Kolochenko warned. Hacker's delight: Using only a web broswer, Ilia Kolochenk claims he hacked the NASDAQ website in only minutes . ‘The only limit is the hacker’s imagination,’ said Mr Kolochenko.

President Obama's beleaguered health care programme has received a ringing endorsement - from Nevada's legal prostitutes. The controversial scheme - otherwise known as Obamacare - is accused of being too expensive by some critics and faced anger after crippling glitches on its website prevented many from signing up when it first launched. But the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has enabled the legal prostitutes to get health insurance cover for the first time. High price: Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, center, says Obamacare is good for the legal prostitutes working in his brothel, but will cost him a fortune in extra tax . 'Having this profession, we aren't . exactly offered group health insurance... I'm excited,' Taylor Lee, who . works at Moonlight Bunny Ranch, told Nevada's news4. Ms Lee said she had repeatedly refused health cover prior to Barack Obama signing the statute. Nevada is the only state in America where, under certain strict circumstances, prostitution is legal. Risk: U.S. President Barack Obama has staked his political legacy on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare .

She added: 'We're independent contractors. We have to get our own insurance but this is truly a blessing.' 'Blessing: Nevada's legal prostitutes say Obamacare, which extends health insurance to millions of Americans previously shunned by the health care industry, is a 'blessing' But to pay for the extension of health . insurance, the Affordable Care Act includes new taxes on high-earners, . the healthcare industry and large businesses - including the brothel's owner. Dennis . Hof claims the new healthcare system will cost him, as an owner of . seven separate brothels - all employing about 15 people each -  a strip club, restaurants and a truck stop, across the state, a fortune. He told news4: 'I'm the sole stockholder but because I'm the owner for all these different businesses, they lump them together. 'What . am I going to do?

Britain has fallen short of the best countries in the world in an international league table measuring the wellbeing of the elderly. It ranked the UK 13th – one place below Ireland – for the levels of income, health and employment of older people. The table, drawn up by academics for the charity HelpAge International, showed the top three were Sweden, Norway and Germany. While Britain is not one of the very best countries in which to grow old, however, the elderly here fare better than in some parts of Europe. Spain, Belgium and Italy are all listed outside the top 20, below poorer nations such as Chile and Slovenia. France is placed only 18th. Poland, an EU member for more than 15 years, is ranked at 62, below Venezuela, El Salvador, Vietnam and the Philippines. HelpAge International, which is based in London but operates mainly in developing countries, commissioned academics from several universities to compile the Global AgeWatch Index, the first of its kind. They considered measures including pensions, poverty rates, life expectancy, levels of employment and education, and whether old people are physically safe and have friends. Britain’s 13th place is based on a good ranking for pensions and benefits such as pension credit. However, the report suggests that healthcare for the elderly in the UK is not up to the best standards. It points to life-expectancy estimates that show babies born here now can expect four years less life than might be expected. It also shows that those who make it to the age of 60 in Japan can expect to live to 86 – three years longer than in Britain. The three lowest-ranked countries of the 91 that could provide enough data about the welfare of their elderly population were Afghanistan, Tanzania and Pakistan.

Two aspiring American rappers said on Saturday in Beijing, China that they had filmed part of a music video in North Korea, hoping the novel locale will make a hit. The rappers known as Pacman and Peso did not say where and how they filmed the footage, which their fundraising proposal suggested would be done on a karaoke party bus in Pyongyang. Their custom trip was arranged through a travel agency specializing in taking Westerners to North Korea, according to the proposal. Pacman and Peso, whose real names are Anthony Bobb and Dontray, spent five days in North Korea to film their music video funded by a Kickstarter campaign . Americans are able to travel to North Korea on arranged tours and are constantly accompanied by North Korea minders. After an elderly American was detained in the country, the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning on Nov. 19, advising against all travel by U.S. citizens to North Korea. The two rappers said their trip shied away from politics. American rappers from left, Pacman and Peso, dance next to their crew members at the Beijing Capital Airport in Beijing, China . 'I mean we did not go there to be political. We just go down there to shoot our video and that about the reason why we went, not political,' said Pacman — whose real name is Anthony Bobb. The duo from the Washington area spoke to reporters at an airport in Beijing upon their return from a five-day trip to North Korea. 'Nobody shot a video in North Korea, let alone thought of it. Nobody even thought of making a video in North Korea. You know what I'm saying?' said Peso, whose real name is Dontray Ennis. They raised more than $10,000 on the crowdsourcing site Kickstarter to fund their trip. The rappers said the unusual move could jumpstart their music careers. They hope to release the video next month. North Korea has detained at least six Americans since 2009, including journalists accused of trespassing and others accused of trying to spread Christianity. North Korea state media claimed Saturday that 85-year-old Korean War veteran Merrill Newman had apologized for committing 'hostile acts' against the state during a trip in October, but the report could not be independently verified. The rappers said they encountered no problem while in North Korea.

A teenage gang is being hunted by police after beating up a disabled grandmother and then urinating on her in the street. Denise Bright, 58, who walks with the aid of a stick, was attacked as she walked home alone from her local shops in Norwich. The grandmother-of-eight cowered on the ground as she was repeatedly kicked in the head, verbally abused and urinated on by the thugs. Victim: Denise Bright, who walks with a stick, was attacked as she walked home alone from her local shops . She only managed to escape after running into the road and into the arms of a passing motorist. Today, Mrs Bright said she was 'too frightened' to leave the house following the attack, which happened near the junction of Brightwell Road and Catton Grove Road. 'I don't know what these lads look like so I can't keep my eyes open for them,' she said. 'I'm so frightened they're going to come after me. It's got to the stage where all I want to do is stay indoors.' Mrs Bright, who had life-saving surgery last Christmas following problems with an artery in her groin, had been walking home at 7.30pm on Saturday, October 19, when the thugs cornered her. Scene: The attack happened near the junction of Brightwell Road and Catton Grove Road, pictured, in Norwich . The teenagers - some of whom were on bikes - started hurling foul-mouthed abuse at her, before launching a brutal, physical assault. 'They just called me a retard and a waste of space and said people like me shouldn't be walking the earth,' she said. 'I just said ""just go away, leave me alone"". The next thing I knew I was being kicked in the back of my legs and knocked to the ground. 'They started kicking me in the head and in the body, and kicked my shopping all over the road. They all had a kick. They were laughing as well.' Mrs Bright, who also suffers from a bad back, added: 'There could have been one or two of them urinating on me, but I was just trying to protect my face.' The terrified grandmother eventually managed to get up, before running into the road to try to escape her attackers. 'One car nearly hit me, but swerved and carried on - but next car stopped,' she said. 'These two lads said ""get in the car, get in the car"". They looked pretty scared, but saw the youths running off. I got into the car and they brought me home. 'If they hadn't picked me up, I hate to think what things could have happened. I was absolutely petrified.' Mrs Bright suffered severe bruising and shock after the attack - but her psychological scars run deeper. 'I'm just too scared to go out,' she said. 'I've already got spinal problems so I like to try and get out and walk if I can. I'm trying to get my life back on track but it's very hard.' She added: 'If anyone saw anything please come forward because these lads need to be caught because they're not going to stop at me.'

Mendez shows off the warming but she was carrying, then turned into a weapon of self defense, on Sunday evening . The family joked to NBCDFW that police should just keep an eye out for a man with burns all over his face and back. But as ingenious as Mendez’s self-defense tactic was, it didn’t come to her immediately. She first tried brandishing another hair removal product: a sharp pair of scissors. The assailant still wouldn’t leave, so Mendez had to think fast. Her turf: It was 8 o'clock and Mendez had just gotten off work when the man approached her in front of her home . In one hand she held a bag of cosmetics products from work. In the other was a warming pot of searing hot body wax. Putting two and two together, she acted—flinging the sticky goo right in his face. The man, who Mendez described as African American ran, presumably having suffered serious burns, and got into a car with two other men. Tools of the trade: Mendez says she first tried brandishing scissors at the man. It was when that didn't work that she flung the wax . Her husband Antonio James arrived home shortly after the startling encounter and at first he wondered why his wife didn’t just hand over the bag of beauty supplies. ‘She said, “He tried to steal my bag,”’ James told NBCDFW. “I thought she was talking about her purse. She said, “No, my plastic bag!” I said, “Oh my God, just leave it there.”’ He’s since realized the robber never had a chance. ‘He thought he could scare her, and she doesn’t scare,’ James laughed.

'This is the very unusual, and quite unique phenomenon of an annual elephant trek through the lodge's reception/lobby area,' explains Ian, who is originally from Bacup, Lancashire. 'From late October every year, families of elephants visit the lodge grounds to feed on the fruit of a 'wild mango' (Cordyla africana) tree which grows in the lodge courtyard. 'Whilst the elephants can access this tree by a variety of routes, they often choose to take a shortcut through the actual building. 'They climb the steps at the lodge entrance and trundle through the lobby, giving the lodge guests a real treat with their antics. 'Whilst the tree is fruiting, through November and into December, the elephants visit at all hours of day and night. Taking the trek to and from the tree at least once a day, the elephants usually take the journey in herds of three to six.

It is a phenomenon that has long been suspected - and now scientists say it really is possible to die of a broken heart. A study has found that when a husband or wife dies, the remaining spouse's risk of dying is 66 per cent higher in the three months after their partner's death. And the effect may be stronger in younger people, say the Harvard researchers. For the new study, they analysed more than 26,000 Americans over age 50. Broken heart: Last year, Marcus Ringrose, the grieving husband of Doctor Who actress Mary Tamm, died the day after her funeral. An inquest heard he had died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, a cardiac condition which can be triggered by emotional stress . They focused on 12,316 of the . participants who were married in 1998 and followed them through 2008 to determine which participants . became widows or widowers, then recorded when they died. There were 2,912 deaths during the study . period. Of those, 2,373 were among married people who left a widow or . widower behind. The other 539 deaths were among people who had become . widows and widowers themselves. Widows and widowers were . more likely to die than people whose spouses were still living, on . average. The effect was strongest during the first three months after a . spouse's death, when they had a 66 per cent increased chance of dying. Fifty of those 539 people . died within three months of losing their spouse, 26 died between three . and six months later and 44 died between six and 12 months later. Earlier research showed men were at . greater risk of dying soon after a spouse than women, but the authors of . this study didn't find a difference. That could be because they took . into account participants' income and wealth, which may have influenced . past findings, they said. Together: Minnesota couple Clifford and Eva Vevea who were 'hopelessly in love' for 65 years of their marriage, died within hours of each other . They added that they still aren't clear on what causes the  widowhood effect. 'It's possible it's a grief-related . mechanism, or that providing care for the sick spouse causes illness in . the surviving spouse,' lead researcher Dr. S. V. Subramanian told Reuters Health. 'Or, as one's spouse gets sicker, the . surviving spouse stops taking care of their own health,' he suggested. Because this study only looked at . people over age 50, it isn't clear whether younger people would face the . same risks after a spouse's death. But Dr Subramanian said some evidence suggests the widowhood effect is actually stronger among younger people. Last year, Marcus Ringrose, the grieving husband of Doctor Who actress Mary Tamm, died the day after her funeral. Miss Tamm had died from cancer two weeks previously and he had given a ‘stunning’ 20-minute eulogy at her funeral. The study found that when a husband or wife dies, the remaining spouse's risk of dying is 66 per cent higher in the three months after their partner's death . But by the next morning, he was dead - of a broken heart. An inquest heard that Mr Ringrose, . 59, who was otherwise fit and well, had died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, a cardiac condition which can . be triggered by emotional stress. In the U.S., a Minnesota couple who were 'hopelessly in love' for all 65 years of . their marriage, died within hours of each other, it was reported earlier this year.

Dr Doka added that widowers may feel especially lonely because they don't know they need to be proactive about finding company. 'One of the problems widowers often have is the lack of support and one of the reasons is that very often the wife, historically, is the keeper of the kids. 'She's the one that called the kids up and said they should come over for dinner, so it's not unusual that widowers will often say no one ever stops over any more, because they didn't realise someone else was calling and inviting them.'","The effect may be stronger in younger people, say the Harvard researchers .

Brigitte Bardot has launched an astonishing attack on the boss of the Queen’s grocer, Fortnum & Mason, for selling ‘cruel’ foie gras. Miss Bardot, a siren of the screen in the 1960s and now an animal welfare campaigner, has described the upmarket store’s managing director, Ewan Venters, as an ‘imbecile’. The 78-year-old former actress and model finds herself at odds with the French farmers who have produced the expensive gourmet food for generations. Attacking 'cruel' foie gras: Brigitte Bardot (right), 1960s screen siren turned animal welfare campaigner, has attacked Ewan Venters (left), the managing director of Fortnum & Mason, for selling foie gras, describing him as an 'imbecile' It is the result of force feeding ducks and geese to the point that their livers become enlarged and ready to be processed into a smooth pate. The livers, which can swell to ten times their normal size, press against the birds’ lungs, causing them to pant constantly. Such is the concern about the welfare of the birds involved that production of foie gras using these methods is banned in Britain. Welfare worry: Miss Bardot disagrees with foie gras production in which geese and birds are force fed until their livers swell to ten times their normal size . Miss Bardot said: ‘Mr Venters seems to . be one of those imbeciles who, just for a fleeting moment of flavour, is . willing to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence that . force-feeding ducks and geese to produce grotesquely enlarged livers for . foie gras is horrifically cruel. ‘I hope France will end this shameful abuse of birds, which is quite rightly banned in Venters' own country. But until then, Mr Venters should keep his hands off our geese.’ She is one of the latest in a long list of welfare groups and celebrities, such as Sir Roger Moore and Sir Paul McCartney, to campaign against the sale of foie gras in the UK. Leading French animal-protection groups – including the Brigitte Bardot Foundation and the Society for the Protection of Animals – have joined a call by the campaigning group PETA for Fortnum & Mason to end the sale of foie gras. They have written to Mr Venters, saying: ‘Thousands of people in France are working towards an end to the shameful practice of force feeding birds and we respectfully urge you not to help keep this inhumane and shrinking industry alive. ‘Vets and avian experts around the world agree it is not possible to produce foie gras humanely.’ They add: ‘Britain has always been regarded as a leader in the humane treatment of animals which is why the production of foie gras is quite rightly illegal in your country. Miss Bardot, who starred in 1963 film Le Mepris (pictured), said she hopes 'France will end this shameful abuse of birds' and her charity, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, has joined PETA's calls for Fortnum & Mason to stop selling foie gras . Celebrity campaign: Miss Bardot is one of the latest in a long list of welfare groups and celebrities, such as Sir Roger Moore (left) and Sir Paul McCartney (right) to campaign against selling foie gras in Britain . Foie gras is made of duck or goose liver. By French law, it is defined as the liver of a duck fattened by force feeding corn. Outside of France it is sometimes produced using natural feeding. The technique, known as gavage, dates back as far as 2500 BC when the ancient Egyptians kept birds for food and deliberately fattened them by force feeding. France is today the largest producer and consumer of foie gras but it is also made and consumed around the world especially in Europe, America and China. In France, foie gras comes in various forms such as whole foie gras which is made of one or two whole liver lobes, or as pieces of livers mixed together. It also comes fully cooked as a moulded block made up of 98 per cent foie gras. ‘Here in France awareness is growing . about the abuse of ducks and geese for foie gras and we are hopeful that . one day soon such a ban will be adopted in France too. ‘Until then we ask that you reconsider . your conscience and question the morality of a British store paying . French farmers to abuse geese in ways that would be illegal in your own . country. Tradition is never an excuse for animal cruelty.’ A store spokesman said: ‘Fortnum & Mason is a traditional retailer who over the centuries has established a strong reputation for supplying certain traditional foods, amongst which is foie gras. ‘As a retailer we are here to provide our customers with the products they ask for, including foie gras and we respect their right to buy and enjoy the foods they like. ‘However we uphold strict guidelines relating to the making of foie gras and work to the best of our abilities to ensure that these gold standard production requirements are upheld at all times by the suppliers we use.’ Keeping with tradition: A Fortnum & Mason (pictured) spokesman said that the retailer had built a 'strong reputation for supplying certain traditional foods, amongst which is foie gras'","Foie gras is made by force feeding geese and birds until their livers swell to ten times their normal size .

An Illinois town that once saw one of the early 20th century’s bloodiest labor disputes has okayed a request to excavate a local cemetery where remains of victims are believed to be buried. A test dig last month revealed a small Herrin, Illinois cemetery could be the final resting place of some of the 18 strike breakers from Chicago who were slaughtered during the 24 hour rampage by striking union miners in 1922. The Herrin City Council agreed Monday to let historians, anthropologists and geologists continue their after searchers reported they’ve uncovered five sets of unmarked remains in burial plots long since sold to other families. Battlefield? It looks peaceful now, but this cemetery in Herrin, Illinois was once the site of one of labor history's bloodiest battles . ‘I think this is important for the city and to the families of the people already buried and those that may be buried there,’ said Herrin City Attorney John Brewster. Researchers say they have discovered evidence of five burials, but no actual remains of victims as of yet. ‘At this time we are not sure we went deep enough,’ Eastern Illinois University geologist Steven Di Naso told the Southern Illinoisan. The excavation began last month after nearly a century had passed since those tragic hours in late June 1922 at Southern Illinois Coal Co's Lester Strip Mine near Herrin. Perished: This historic photograph shows Herrin Cemetery where some of the people killed in the 1922 massacre were buried in a common grave. Historians will now excavate the site in search of their remains . The United Mine Workers of America saw rapid growth in the early 1920s. Beloved by mining communities, hated by mine owners, and mistrusted by much of America, the union sought safer working conditions and fair pay. This often came at the cost of the physical safety of scab workers and communities where mine owners sought to wrench power from the powerful union. A union-wide UMW strike, one of many at the time, was in effect prior to the Herrin Massacre and even helped lead up to the tragedy. The UMW backed the Herrin miners both because they were members and because they feared that if their mine was successfully run with scabs, then other mines would follow suit. One thing that has fueled the renewed interest is historian Scott Doody’s book Herrin Massacre. In his book, Doody contends that part of the Herrin cemetery contains two burial layers. The lower one, he says, contains remains from massacre victims. The most recent dig at Herrin Cemetery was the third and came after two less successful ones that had some members of the community up in arms over fears that modern gravesites will be disturbed. A judge issued an injunction on any further disturbances in the cemetery. The city was later given the say in the matter and council members reversed the injunction Monday. Mayor Vic Ritter had said he believed there'd been enough work done at the cemetery by searchers from Eastern Illinois University and Southern Illinois University. But those behind the excavation say they've allayed some of Ritter's concerns by using a less-invasive technique of checking soil samples instead of frequently using a backhoe. ‘They’re trying to be as gentle as possible,’  Bill Sizemore, chairman of the city’s public works committee, told the Carbondale Times. Rampage: This 1922 photo shows the ruins of a powder house which was attacked by striking miners during the 1922 Herrin Massacre, which left bodies strewn across the southern Illinois town after a rampage by fire union miners . Tragic moments: An airplane view of the Herrin mine district just days after union miners on strike killed 18 scab workers and left hundreds of others injured . During a national coal strike by United Mine Workers of America in 1922, hundreds of miners at the Southern Illinois Coal Company mine near Herrin, Illinois were among those who put down their tools and called for better treatment, better wages, and shorter hours. During the strike, the lack of workers across the coal fields of Western Pennsylvania and down into the strip mines of the Midwest caused a shortage of coal. Consequently, coal prices shot up with the increased scarcity. In an effort to capitalize on spiking prices, Southern Illinois Mining Co. owner William J. Lester fired his unionized employee at the Herrin mine and brought in professional strike breakers from Chicago according to an account from the thesouthern.com. A hundred or so of the disenfranchised union workers met on June 21 in the Herrin cemetery. Back in town, hundreds of others stole guns and ammunition in preparation for what was going to be a bloody fight. They surrounded the mine and a shootout ensued, with both sides armed and firing at one another. After the National Militia asked for a truce and Lester agreed to shut down the mine, the gunfire ceased. However, armed union men still surrounded the scab miners who remained standing. Eventually, the standoff ended with the strike breakers surrendering. As the union men led them away from the mine at gunpoint, more shots were fired. Some men were told to run for their lives only to be shot in the back. A group of six scabs had their shoes taken and were forced to crawl to Herrin cemetery. One there, they were strung up together with rope and shot. Three survived the shots and the union men slit their throats. All told, 18 strike breakers were killed, while just two union workers perished. While they don't agree on exactly where, scholars generally believe the victims were tossed, without fanfare or a single visitor, into a mass grave at Herrin. Two trials followed 214 murder indictments. Out of 9 accused, neither trial ended in a single conviction.","The Herrin Massacre in southern Illinois saw the slaying of 18 strike breaking miners at the hands of several hundred striking workers over the course of less than 24 hours .

The case was kept closed for seven decades in a house in the far north of Scotland, because the owner lost the key and assumed it contained only worthless old family documents. But when it was forced open, it revealed thousands of pounds worth of diamond earrings, rings and collars, emeralds and other treasures which once belonged to the owner’s grandmother and two maiden aunts. This attache case, which had been dismissed and left untouched for 70 years revealed a bounty of expensive jewellery when it was finally unlocked . A breathtaking diamond collar worth £4,000-6,000 was one of hte treasures found in the forgotten case . The 22 precious pieces will be sold at Bonhams’ Edinburgh auction room on Wednesday, when experts say they could far exceed their £55,000 pre-sale estimate. The jewellery went on display today for the first time since the Second World War, ahead of the sale. Clare Blatherwick, Bonhams’ Head of Jewellery in Scotland, said the items only came to light because the owner planned to throw the old crocodile-skin case out. A bout of curiosity made her force the lock first. Incredible pieces like this Enameled Necklace (estimated value £2-3,000) only came to light when the owners were about to throw the case out . The collection offers a snapshot of 19th century jewellery and design. This Lady's Diamond Fob watch is estimated at £300-£500 . Among the valuable items she found were a pair of diamond single-stone earrings, weighing approximately seven carats, estimated to fetch £15,000-20,000; and a 19th century Indian enamelled necklace with a Footprint of Vishnu (Vishnupada) pendant, estimated at £2000-3000. Other items included a French cameo brooch depicting Flora, the goddess of flowers sprinkling flowers over cherubs, estimated to make £700-900; and a variety of natural pearls, diamond necklaces and gem-set brooches. Ms Blatherwick said: 'This has all the ingredients of a fairy story -- a locked case, a missing key and hidden treasure. 'There were a lot of boxes of papers and it was assumed this was just another. It must have been a wonderful moment when the case was opened and the jewellery saw the light of day for the first time in 70 years.

Steam engine fan Karl Doran, seven, of Darlington, died at an open-air museum after he fell off the steam engine he was riding and was crushed . A schooboy volunteer at an open-air museum died after he fell off the steam roller he was riding on and was crushed by the trailer it was towing, an inquest has heard. Karl Doran, seven, was standing on the tow-bar of the vintage steam roller being driven by his father Phillip, 41, in front of visitors to Beamish Museum in Stanley, County Durham, when he fell off it in July last year. He was crushed by the 1.5 tonne trailer, the inquest at Crook Civic Centre, County Durham heard, and when his father noticed the trailer rocking, he looked around to see his son lying, lifeless, a few yards behind it. The father and son, from Darlington, had been helping other volunteers work on the engines before setting off around the site in July last year. Detective Chief Inspector Victoria Fuller, from Durham Constabulary, said Karl had been seen sitting on the tow bar by members of the public and that his father had asked him to join him in the engine after he began to drag his feet. 'Mr Doran became aware of the trailer rocking and he then realised that Karl was no longer on the engine,' she said. 'He noticed Karl lying about 15-20 feet behind the trailer on the road. He was not responsive and there were no signs of life.' The inquest heard that the museum had not dealt properly with the risk assessment of towing trailers and the carrying of passengers and children. Victoria Wise, from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said Beamish was aware that children would ride on the engines but that they relied on the competence of the drivers. 'Riding on a draw bar is a dangerous place to be, every year there are numerous accidents in agriculture where people are riding on draw bars,' she said. 'We would never allow a child or an adult to ride on a draw bar of a machine. Paramedics were called to the Beamish Museum, pictured, but Karl was pronounced dead at the scene . Tragic accident: Young Karl would often ride on the steam traction engines at the museum in period dress, left. The image on the right is pixelated as the people riding the engine were not involved in the accident . 'Riding on the bar itself puts you between two pieces of moving machinery and its not designed to carry passengers.' As a result the HSE issued Beamish with an improvement notice, which they took action on, though the investigation is still ongoing. After instructing the jury to deliver a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Andrew Tweddle said it was a tragic case which no-one would have expected. 'This is a very simple case but an incredibly tragic one at the same time,' he said.  'No one, particularly Karl’s dad, would have expected things to turn out in the way that they did that day. 'I hope through the evidence being given this morning there will be lessons learned which will reduce similar fatalities in the future.'

A kayak fisherman from Washington died on Monday off the coast of Maui after a shark bit off his dangling foot officials on the Hawaiian island said today. Police identified the kayaker as Patrick A. Briney, 57 of Stevenson, who was kayaking with a friend from Makena Landing towards Big Beach when he was attacked around 9 a.m. Police say Briney began to scream, 'which caught the attention of his . friend' who found him with severe bleeding from his right leg and one witness reported that the victim's leg 'was all bone with the foot off. Scroll down for video . Deadly Encounter: Kihei Boat Ramp, the scene of where the victim was recovered in today's fatal shark attack today off the coast of Maui . Desperately trying to stem the bleeding his fishing partner tied a tourniquet on Brineyand sought help from a nearby charter tour boat. The boat took them to shore, and Briney was then taken to a hospital, the state said. It's unclear when he was pronounced dead. Tthe kind of shark involved in the attack has not been identified or confirmed yet. Though the attack happened far from shore, the state advised the public to stay out of the water a mile north and a mile south of Makena State Recreation Area in southwest Maui. Aftermath: Emergency workers and police speak to reporters at Kihei Boat Ramp - where Patrick A. Briney was brought to shore today after his horror shark attack . 'Maui County Ocean Safety officers received a report around 10:20 a.m. that said the male victim was fishing in his kayak somewhere between . Maui and Molokini when he was bitten by a shark,' said county officials . in a press release issued following the incident. There have been eight shark attacks near Maui this year and 13 statewide. On Friday, a woman suffered nonfatal injuries in a Maui attack. 'We are not sure why these bites are occurring more frequently than normal, especially around Maui,' said department Chairman William Aila Jr. 'That's why we are conducting a two-year study of shark behavior around Maui that may give us better insights.' Tragedy: Patrick A. Briney was rushed to hospital after being brought back to the beach at Kihei Boat Ramp - but later succumbed to injuries . Warnings: County and state officials have closed beaches from Makena Landing to the surf area known as 'Dumps' until noon Tuesday. The waters off Makena State Recreational Area have been closed as well . Over the last 20 years, Hawaii has averaged about four unprovoked shark incidents per year, the state said. In August, a German tourist died a week after losing her arm in a shark attack. Jana Lutteropp, 20, was snorkeling up to 100 yards off a beach in southwest Maui when the shark bit off her right arm. Before Lutteropp's death, the last shark attack fatality in Hawaii was in 2004, when a tiger shark bit Willis McInnis' leg while he was surfing in Maui.

"By . David Martosko In Washington . PUBLISHED: . 15:39 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:28 EST, 22 April 2013 . It wasn't too long ago that the idea of Republicans vocally supporting a long-term citizenship outlook for oft-derided 'illegals' would have send pundits and editors scrambling to be sure it wasn't April Fool's Day. Not anymore. And if anti-immigration conservatives thought the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings would derail talk in Washington of immigration reform, they didn't count on Grover Norquist, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, the Cato Institute, or an obscure Republican lobbyist named Peggy Ellis. While Ellis and Rubio aren't talking, both Cato and Americans for Tax Reform - Norquist's group - say it shouldn't shock anyone that they favor a quasi-amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants. Cato, the libertarian think-tank, is an unabashed supporter of liberalizing immigration law but typically has limited influence among red-meat-eating Republican policymakers. Norquist, the Republican anti-tax crusader, has long been known in Washington for being - as one think-tank lobbyist who requested anonymity put it to MailOnline on Monday - 'squishy on the immigration issue, in a way that makes lots of right-wingers nervous.' That squishiness, it seems, is driving Republican in-fighting and casting Norquist as he black sheep in an increasingly immigration-aimless GOP. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is a reliable conservative voice against tax hikes, but a surprising cheerleader, to some, on immigration reform . Rubio, a Florida senator whose parents escaped Cuba's regime, is the leading GOP light on a bipartisan plan to shift America's immigration frame in the direction of granting gradual amnesties to illegal immigrants. Rubio, Arizona Sen. John McCain, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham have raised hackles among party loyalists for reaching compromises some see as a prelude to runaway amnesty. Graham is telling TV audiences that the bombing should increase demands for an organized, government-led mainstreaming of immigrants without documents. He said on CNN Sunday that the Boston bombing was another reason to 'bring all of the 11 million' illegal immigrants living in the U.S. 'out of the shadows and find out who they are.' And Rubio, through the mysterious lobbyist and would-be lever-puller Peggy Ellis, endorsed a set of emailed talking points that attempted to undo any damage the Boston bombing may have done to pro-immigration efforts. Sen. Lindsey Graham says immigration reform would bring bad actors like the Tsarnaev brothers 'out of the shadows' so the government can 'find out who they are.' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's talking points argue that the Boston bombers 'came here under the existing system' and 'didn't cross the border' illegally to enter the U.S. Ellis's email, titled 'Talkers from Rubio, was in part a result of working during the previous days with Cato and Americans for Tax Reform. 'Rubio talking points re: Boston terrorists vis a vis immigration reform' was its headline. 'These terrorists came here under the existing system, the one opponents of reform want to leave in place,' the first message point said, followed by the observation that the terrorist brothers from Chechnya 'didn't cross the border' illegally to enter the United States. 'The reason we know who they are is because they were here legally,' Rubio's talking points added. 'If they were here illegally, living in the shadows, it would have made them much harder to investigate. The fact is that today there are 11 million people already in this country and we don’t know who they are, why they’re here, and what they’re doing. That is not only an economic problem, it’s a huge national security problem as well.' Ellis, who sent the email to a coalition of groups on the right side of the political spectrum, was briefly a Cato lobbyist - 'she was here for a few blinks of an eye,' one Cato employee told MailOnline - and has also lobbied on immigration issues for Nueva Esperanza, a Philadelphia-based immigrants' rights group. She is also a former top lobbyist at the Republican National Committee, placing her at the center of a small Republican movement to break away from the party's historic opposition to full citizenship for illegal immigrants. Vast left-wing conspiracy? Senate Democrats (L to R) Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy and Chuck Schumer conferred during Monday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on immigration reform. Liberals favor a plan to set 11 million illegal immigrants on a path to full citizenship. Four prominent Republicans - and at last a few ordinarily right-wing think tanks - have joined them . Ellis's brief cameo in the immigration chronicle of 2013 as a go-between - she's a minor enough figure to make publishable photographs impossible to find - is an example of the obscure centers of gravity now found in a debate where strange bedfellows have become the norm. The conservative blog Breitbart.com has published excerpts of emails between Ellis and immigration policy leaders at both Cato and Americans for Tax Reform, along with Ellis's talking-points missive. Those messages, which appeared on the Breitbart 'Big Government' website, seem to outline a plan to help push the so-called 'Gang Of Eight' immigration bill through Congress by crafting testimony from Norquist in a way that sidesteps the Boston massacre while asking other groups to carry messages about the attacks that favor the 'Gang Of Eight' legislation. Norquist deputy Josh Culling had choice words for . the Breitbart online publishing empire and its choice of a headline that claimed his group . 'use[d] the Boston terror attacks' to push immigration reform. 'This . is a false, provocative, and disgusting headline that is not at all . supported by the story itself,' he sniped. 'To suggest that we are . exploiting the tragedy in Boston is the opposite of the truth.' The . Breitbart News Network sniped back. 'The emails speak for themselves,' the company told . MailOnline. 'Those involved could have taken the moral high ground and resisted . any politics in the discussion. Instead they plotted to spin events in . favor of the immigration bill.' Maria Cruz of Wichita, Kansas, center, with a group called Sunflower Community Action, came to the Senate hearing to support the 'path' to citizenship promised to illegal immigrants by President Barack Obma . One of the emails, sent April 18, shows Culling asking Ellis for help with testimony that his boss is set to deliver in a Senate hearing Monday afternoon. 'I need to push on this,' Culling wrote, referring to questions about how an influx of new U.S. citizens would affect the already-strained Social Security system. '[T]his is the one question GGN [Grover Glenn Norquist] may get when testifying that I don't have a strong answer to. Can you see if your old boss at Cato can help?' 'Will do. ... I’m happy to help w Grover's testimony. ... will work on n [sic] the SS stuff first.' Ellis sought help from Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy wonk at Cato. He responded that he was 'meeting with Josh [Culling] later today about this and already sent him a memo pertaining to it. The Boston thing could derail this big time.' Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who now leads the influential right-wing Heritage Foundation, argued in a USA Today op-ed on April 17 that creating millions of new citizens will ultimately require a bank-breaking explosion of government entitlements. 'As soon as any of the nearly 11 million unauthorized immigrants are given legal status, the political fight will turn to speeding their transition to citizenship and promises of a full array of federal benefits,' he wrote. 'Big Government,' a conservative website launched by the right-wing firebrand Andrew Breitbart and maintained by his media company after his shocking death in 2012, accused Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute of colluding with lobbyist Peggy Ellis to help maneuver Republicans to the left on immigration . Josh Culling of Americans for Tax Reform (L) asked lobbyist Peggy Ellis for help massaging Grover Norquist's arguments about immigration and Social Security, a task for which she turned to Alex Nowrasteh (R), an immigration expert with the Cato Institute . Ultimately, Norquist submitted testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee that focused on the benefits of flexible labor opportunities as government opens up the market to workers who were previously off the radar. 'Allowing undocumented workers to move from job to job, travel easily and safely, search out and interview for different jobs in different sectors and locations would greatly increase their productivity,' Norquist will say, according to his prepared remarks, 'and they would become greater contributors to their own well-being and the wealth of our nation.' Overall, Norquist's group favors enlarging the tax base by adding new taxpayers, rather than the increase of income tax rates for everyone. But his testimony doesn't directly address the idea of what will happen when new citizens retire by the millions. Instead he criticizes other Republicans by saying they have failed to embrace a 'dynamic' approach to predicting what a pro-immigrant America will look like a generation from now. Those conservatives are 'exaggerating public benefit costs', predicting 'impossible levels of immigrant use,' 'assuming immigrant wages will remain stagnant,' and 'conceding the size of the current welfare state, rather than working to reform it.' Members of National People's Action, an immigrants' rights group, brought emotion to an outdoor rally as the Senate hearing proceeded inside . A Cato Institute insider told MailOnline on background that its alliance with Norquist's group isn't a big deal, but conceded that it's odd to find the conservative firebrand carrying water for libertarians. Culling, the Americans for Tax Reform government affairs expert, told MailOnline much the same thing through a spokesman. 'It is no secret that ATR is supportive of the current immigration reform effort,' he said. 'It is also no secret that we are working with other conservatives who support the bill.' Ellis didn't respond to emailed questions. Rubio's press secretary offered no comment.","Conservative crusader Grover Norquist argues for immigration bill as most Republicans run for cover .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:50 EST, 28 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:50 EST, 28 November 2013 . China said it sent warplanes into its newly declared maritime air defense zone days after the U.S., South Korea and Japan all sent flights through the airspace in defiance of rules Beijing says it has imposed in the East China Sea. China's air force on Thursday sent several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft on normal air patrols in the zone, the Xinhua agency reported, citing air force spokesman Shen Jinke. The report did not specify exactly when the flights were sent or whether they had encountered foreign aircraft. The United States, Japan and South Korea have said they have sent flights through the zone without encountering any Chinese response since Beijing announced the creation of the zone last week. Enforcers: China has said it will now enforce rules it applied to the maritime defense zone over the East China Sea . Shen described Thursday's flights as 'a defensive measure and in line with international common practices.' He said China's air force would remain on high alert and will take measures to protect the country's airspace. While China's surprise announcement last week to create the zone initially raised some tensions in the region, analysts say Beijing's motive is not to trigger an aerial confrontation but is a more long-term strategy to solidify claims to disputed territory by simply marking the area as its own. China's lack of efforts to stop the foreign flights - including two U.S. B-52s that flew through the zone on Tuesday - has been an embarrassment for Beijing. Even some Chinese state media outlets suggested Thursday that Beijing may have mishandled the episodes. 'Beijing needs to reform its information release mechanism to win the psychological battles waged by Washington and Tokyo,' the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid published by the Communist Party's flagship People's Daily, said in an editorial. Without prior notice, Beijing began demanding Saturday that passing aircraft identify themselves and accept Chinese instructions or face consequences in an East China Sea zone that overlaps a similar air defense identification zone overseen by Japan since 1969 and initially part of one set up by the U.S. military. But when tested just days later by U.S. B-52 flights - with Washington saying it made no effort to comply with China's rules, and would not do so in the future - Beijing merely noted, belatedly, that it had seen the flights and taken no further action. South Korea's military said Thursday its planes flew through the zone this week without informing China and with no apparent interference. Japan also said its planes have been continuing to fly through it after the Chinese announcement, while the Philippines, locked in an increasingly bitter dispute with Beijing over South China Sea islands, said it also was rejecting China's declaration. No response: The USS George Washington took part in a joint military naval drill with Japan on Thursday in waters off southern Japan, saying the event took place in the general vicinity of the new airspace defense zone which China established last week . Analysts question China's technical ability to enforce the zone due to a shortage of early warning radar aircraft and in-flight refueling capability. However, many believe that China has a long-term plan to win recognition for the zone with a gradual ratcheting-up of warnings and possibly also eventual enforcement action. 'With regard to activity within the zone, nothing will happen - for a while,' said June Teufel Dreyer, a China expert at the University of Miami. 'Then the zone will become gradually enforced more strictly. The Japanese will continue to protest, but not much more, to challenge it.' That may wear down Japan and effectively change the status quo, she said. The zone is seen primarily as China's latest bid to bolster its claim over a string of uninhabited Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea - known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Beijing has been ratcheting up its sovereignty claims since Tokyo's nationalization of the islands last year. But the most immediate spark for the zone likely was Japan's threat last month to shoot down drones that China says it will send to the islands for mapping expeditions, said Dennis Blasko, an Asia analyst at think tank CNA's China Security Affairs Group and a former Army attache in Beijing. The zone comes an awkward time. Although Beijing's ties with Tokyo are at rock bottom, it was building good will and mutual trust with Washington following a pair of successful meetings between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, the zone feud now threatens to overshadow both the visit by Vice President Joe Biden to Beijing next week and one by Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop expected before the end of the year. China's defense and foreign ministries offered no additional clarification Thursday as to why Beijing failed to respond to the U.S. Air Force flights. Alliance partners the U.S. and Japan together have hundreds of military aircraft in the immediate vicinity. Demands: China issued a list of requirements for all foreign aircraft passing through the area and said its armed forces would adopt 'defensive emergency measures' against aircraft that don't comply . China on Saturday issued a list of requirements for all foreign aircraft passing through the area, regardless of whether they were headed into Chinese airspace, and said its armed forces would adopt 'defensive emergency measures' against aircraft that don't comply. Beijing said the notifications are needed to help maintain air safety in the zone. However, the fact that China said it had identified and monitored the two U.S. bombers during their Tuesday flight seems to discredit that justification for the zone, said Rory Medcalf, director of the international security program at Australia's Lowy Institute . 'This suggests the zone is principally a political move,' Medcalf said. 'It signals a kind of creeping extension of authority.' Along with concerns about confrontations or accidents involving Chinese fighters and foreign aircraft, the zone's establishment fuels fears of further aggressive moves to assert China's territorial claims - especially in the hotly disputed South China Sea, which Beijing says belongs entirely to it. Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun confirmed those concerns on Saturday by saying China would establish additional air defense identification zones 'at an appropriate time.' For now, however, China's regional strategy is focused mostly on Japan and the island dispute, according to government-backed Chinese scholars. China will continue piling the pressure on Tokyo until it reverses the decision to nationalize the islands, concedes they are in dispute, and opens up negotiations with Beijing, said Shen Dingli, a regional security expert and director of the Center for American Studies at Shanghai's Fudan University. 'China has no choice but to take counter measures,' Shen said. 'If Japan continues to reject admitting the disputes, it's most likely that China will take further measures.'","China announced it would impose rules in the airspace above the East China Sea .

Passengers must now pass through security when they leave two airports in the Northeast - entering bulletproof glass pods for a few seconds before being able to exit. The futuristic unmanned portals have replaced officers at the security exits of the Syracuse, New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey airports. They prevent passengers from backtracking into secure areas once they exit the plane and keep outsiders from entering through the exits. Travelers step into the elevator-sized cylinders and wait as a door slides closed behind them. After a couple of seconds, another door opens in front with a female voice coolly instructing, 'Please exit'. New measures: Passengers walk through security portals at the Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey. The doors are designed to keep people from coming back through exits to secure areas . 'I don't understand those doors,' said Cindy Katz, of Jupiter, Florida, who came through the Atlantic City airport for the Thanksgiving holiday. 'What are they supposed to do? It slows everyone down.' But they could be the wave of things to come as the Transportation Security Administration prepares to shift exit-monitoring duties to local airports next year as a way to save $88.1 million. The doors' manufacturer, New York City-based Eagle Security Group, Inc., says it is in talks with other airports. The technology saves airports from having to put paid security staff at the exit checkpoints. Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, who is pushing to keep the TSA in charge of exit monitoring, says such staffing could cost Philadelphia International Airport about $2 million a year. Syracuse Aviation Commissioner Christina Callahan, whose airport installed eight portals this past fall at a total cost of about $750,000, says staffing each exit with a guard would cost about $580,000 a year. 'So when compared with the cost to install the portals, they will have paid for themselves and begin saving the airport money in little over a year,' Callahan said. Money-saving: The exits also do not need to be manned, saving the airports paying for exit staff . As one final security measure, travelers step into the elevator-sized . cylinders and wait as a door slides closed behind them. After a couple . of seconds, another door opens in front with a female voice coolly . instructing, 'Please exit'. Passengers can then leave the airport. The exits, which are large enough for passengers to take luggage with them, are designed to stop outsiders getting to secure areas in the airport. So far they are only in use in Syracuse, New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey. Officials say the exits will merely add a few seconds to the end of the journey, but some passengers expressed their concern that the exits could cause lines. Others have worried whether they are being scanned somehow while closed inside. While . it is possible to equip portals with biometric scanning technology, . officials say the current versions do nothing but form a barrier between . the secure and nonsecure areas of the airport. 'We're not scanning anything or doing anything really,' South Jersey Transportation Authority spokesman Kevin Rehmann said. 'When one side's open, the other side's closed. Period.' 'Certainly funding is limited for staffing,' she said. 'Airports are going to have to find other ways to keep up with mandates.' In Atlantic City, the manpower savings from the portals are estimated at $300,000 a year, South Jersey Transportation Authority spokesman Kevin Rehmann said. The airport has had a version of the exits since about 2009, but upgraded its five portals last year as part of a $25 million terminal renovation. The portals are intended to remove the potential for the kind of human error that was blamed for a 2010 breach that shut down a Newark Liberty International Airport terminal for several hours and caused worldwide flight delays after a Rutgers graduate student slipped under a rope to see his girlfriend off on her flight. On recent evenings in both Syracuse and Atlantic City, there did not appear to be any sign of backups caused by the roughly five-second process of entering and exiting through the portals. Signs encouraged travelers to enter the pods in groups - they can accommodate up to six people at a time - rather than one by one. 'It went smoothly,' says Robert Beech, who arrived back home in Syracuse on a flight from New York City. 'Just had to wait for the doors to open and close. Even with carry-on, pull-behind bags, you can still get through there without having to worry about bumping into things.' Mindy Carpenter, of Cortland, who was waiting for friends to arrive from Washington state, says she wasn't a fan of the doors. 'It just took so long for the four of them to come through,' she said. Mixed reviews: Some passengers have said they worry the exits will cause queues as they try to leave . The appearance of the exits in Syracuse provoked a blogger to label them 'detention pods' in furtherance of a police state. Aviation security expert Jeff Price calls the criticism unwarranted. 'It doesn't do anything to you. There's no privacy intrusion. All it does is prevent a backflow of people,' said Price, a professor at Metropolitan State University in Denver. 'It's not conducting a National Security Agency check or something.' A common question among passengers is whether they are being scanned somehow while closed inside. While it is possible to equip portals with biometric scanning technology, officials say the current versions do nothing but form a barrier between the secure and nonsecure areas of the airport. 'We're not scanning anything or doing anything really,' Rehmann said. 'When one side's open, the other side's closed.

Memorial: The couple were driving down a narrow stretch of road in East Brunswick when the crash happened . The crash happened on Dutch Road, a popular but narrow thoroughfare between Milltown, where Surace was from, and Spotswood, Szatkowski's hometown. The two towns share the high school so it's used by many teenagers. An investigation into the crash is ongoing. The two were taken to Robert Wood Johnson University hospital where they later died of their injuries. All-American couple: Szatkowski was on both the football and baseball teams. When Surace was at Spotswood, she was the captain of the varsity cheerleading team. Surace graduated last year and was in her first year of college . School spirit: When she was at Spotswood, Surace (left) was captain of the varsity cheerleading team .

Their young relationship continued even after Surace graduated and started college. Like many young couples, the two showed their love for each other on social media. One of Szatkowski's last tweets was dedicated to his 'amazing' girlfriend. After hearing about the crash, about 100 of their friends gathered at the hospital to show support. Best season in 11 years: Szatkowski's football coach said he was one of the reasons the team was doing so well this year . Most were student-athletes or coaches, who knew Surace from her days as the varsity cheerleading captain or Szatkowski, who was on both the football and baseball teams. 'It's way too early - there's no way she should have been done that soon,' Surace's cheerleading coach of 10 years, Kenny Wisniewski, told NJ.com. Szatkowski's football coach Andy Cammarano attributed the team's 7-3 record to the lighthearted senior. 'We were never uptight before games because of Jeff,' he said. 'We had out best season in 11 years and Jeff was a huge part of that.' Spotswood Athletics Director Bill Visokay was at the hospital with other members of the community mourning the young couple's loss. 'A parent should never have to bury their own kids and my heart and the heart of the school community really out to both families,' Mr Visokay told MyCJ.com. 'It was amazing to see the amount of support within the Spotswood school community, especially seeing so many parents, as well as student-athletes, at a time of need to give support to the families, and to be able to hope and pray the outcome would be much different,' he added. A memorial at the crash site was constructed soon after the community learned that the two had died. What happened? The car accident that killed the couple is still under investigation . Two wooden crosses were put in the ground on the side of the road, and people stopped by to drop off flowers. Friends of the couple remembered the two on Twitter, with pictures of the memorial site and pictures of them together.","Spotswood high school senior Jeffrey Szatkowski, 17, and his 18-year-old girlfriend Nicole Surace were killed in a car crash Saturday night .

Sentenced: Paul Alton was jailed for 30 months after police found a 'bizarre' homemade weapon capable of firing rounds of exploding ammunition at his remote farm . A farmer who made a 'bizarre' gun capable of firing 74 rounds of expanding bullets has been jailed for 30 months after his frightened wife reported him to police. The weapon was crudely constructed from lumps of wood, belts and tags, attached to a barrel from an air rifle and could shoot ammunition that would mushroom on hitting flesh. Paul Alton, 51, claimed he kept the gun for the 'humane killing' of the cattle on his remote farm in Bacup, Lancashire. But the father-of-two was jailed for breaching UK gun laws after police found the pistol in his loft and a shotgun under his bed despite having lost his gun licence. Police had been called to his home after a fierce row in which 51-year-old Alton . wielded a lump hammer at his wife Kim - prompting her to tell officers . about the hidden weapons. The pistol, found in the loft, was described as a contraption worthy of British illustrator Heath . Robinson who was renowned for his drawings of eccentric machines. But . tests revealed the wooden weapon, which was attached to the barrel from . an air rifle, was capable of firing .22 ammunition and 74 rounds of . expanding ammunition that would mushroom on hitting flesh. Police investigations revealed that Alton had formerly owned a shotgun licence, but it had been taken away in 2000 and a reapplication to be legally allowed to use a weapon was unsuccessful. He had been given the pistol by his uncle who used it to kill animals . during the course of his career as a butcher. Alton claimed he had . the gun for the 'humane dispatch' of animals, although he had never used . it for that purpose, and said he had only kept it because of his 'magpie . instinct'. He had test fired it twice. At Burnley Crown Court Alton had faced a mandatory five year prison term under the current gun laws after being caught with the loaded firearms. Bizarre: The weapon, given to Alton by his uncle, was made of wood, belts and plastic tags and was capable of firing 74 rounds of ammunition . However, he was given a reduced sentence of 30 months after Judge Beverley Lunt said the case was 'exceptional' and the pistol as 'bizarre'. The judge said: 'It’s a weapon, it’s a gun, it can fire at anybody and it could dispatch humans. 'But you weren’t holding it for criminals and you weren’t using it for criminal purposes. Five years would be manifestly excessive althought there must be a custodial sentence.' Earlier Mark Lamberty, prosecuting, said the firearms were discovered in April after Alton and his wife of 14 years argued at their home and he brandished a lump hammer and brought it down, striking the arm of the chair she was sitting in. She called police and he was arrested when police stopped his car on the M65 and found a work knife in his jeans. Deadly: The court was told that the pistol was 'extremely dangerous' Mr Lamberty said police had found the unloaded shotgun in a bag at the farmhouse. He said of the homemade pistol: 'It will fire and an expert was able to fire it. It is extremely dangerous and shouldn’t be done by anybody other than an expert.' Joe Boyd, mitigating, said his client had been a farmer since the age of 16 and knew no other environment. He . added: 'The pistol was an extremely Heath Robinson home-made type of . weapon and it had been given to Mr Alton five or six years before by his . uncle. Intention: Alton kept the guns at his cattle farm for the 'humane dispatch' of animals, and had 'no idea' of its significance, according to his defence lawyer (file photo) 'His intention was to use it for the humane dispatch of animals. He had no idea of the significance of the pistol.' Alton admitted possessing a prohibited weapon - the .22 pistol, with a barrel less than 30 centimetres. He also pleaded guilty to assault and to possessing a 12 gauge single barrel shotgun and ammunition - two .22 bulleted rifle cartridges - without a firearms certificate. He further admitted possessing expanding ammunition - 74 .22 long rifle bulleted cartridges and having an article with a blade or point - a lock knife - as well as attempting to pervert the course of justice. Alton also received a five year restraining order, banning him from contacting his wife.","Paul Alton was jailed for 30 months for breaching UK gun laws .

Wanted: Police believe Eugene Palmer, 73, is still alive and on the run after shooting his daughter-in-law dead after a false lead this weekend . Bones that were initially believed to belong to a missing fugitive have now been identified as animal remains. Eugene Palmer went on the run after allegedly shooting his daughter-in-law on September 24, 2012. After the shooting, Eugene is believed to have fled into Harriman State Park where he had previously worked as a park ranger. There was a false breakthrough in the case over the weekend after Eugene's son Clarence consulted a psychic who led them to a collection of bones inside the woods. Clarence and other relatives disputed earlier police reports which claimed Eugene was still alive, saying that he would have died by now given his diabetes, dementia and undisclosed heart condition. On Saturday, the group found a forearm, parts of a shoulder and portions of fingers that they then called in to police. LoHud newspaper reports that police spent three hours investigating the scene and testing the bones before determining that they once belonged to an animal and not the elderly fugitive. 'I thought we were closing in on him, but that’s not the case,' Clarence's friend Kevin Rose told the paper. 'Personally, I think it was a bear... It had five fingers.' The search for Eugene was launched after the death of his 39-year-old daughter-in-law Tammy. Harassed: . Before her September 24, 2012 death, Tammy Palmer, pictured left, said . the man had been harassing her since she separated from his son, John . Killed: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two children, was shot dead on Monday September 24 after walking her children to a school bus stop . He remains the sole suspect after allegedly confessing to the crime to his sister. He was charged with the murder two months after she was killed. He is believed to have taken off into the 46,613-acre park and his relatives have complained that they feel the police investigation into his whereabouts has dropped off over time. 'We thoroughly searched these woods over the course of two weeks, I don't believe he's here,' Sgt. George Lutz of the Haverstraw Police Department told Fox News in May. 'He knows that park like the back of his hand.' His truck was found in nearby Harriman State Park on the same day Tammy was killed and officers began their search for him.. Great escape: Authorities say they have combed through Harriman State Park's 46,600-acres (pictured) since his disappearance but have yet to find a body . Mourning: Violet Pannirello, left, says her daughter Tammy's, right, relationship with her father in law had grown ugly. Tammy had just dropped her children at the school bus when she was shot dead . Tammy Palmer's family claimed that . Eugene Palmer had begun a campaign of harassment against her after the . 39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged . husband, John. The order . prevented him from entering the home where she was raising their two . children, aged 12 and 16. She lived in a separate house but on the same . property as her father-in-law. The suspect's sister, Elaine Babcock, claimed he rushed to her house straight after the killing and admitted what he'd done. 'He just came in and said, ""Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough. 'I . shot and killed Tammy.

"By . Paul Bentley . PUBLISHED: . 18:45 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 2 December 2013 . Director General Lord Hall is alleged to have intervened in the programme's broadcast . The BBC is to finally screen an investigation into claims that millions of pounds donated to Comic Relief were invested in tobacco and arms firms instead of going straight to charity. The corporation said it would broadcast the Panorama documentary in the coming weeks after it was reportedly twice shelved by bosses. The probe, which says £150million was invested for eight years before being handed to good causes, is potentially embarrassing for the BBC, which has close ties to Comic Relief. It is thought it can only be shown now after bosses reviewed the footage. The programme was initially cancelled by executives in the run-up to . Children in Need in November, drawing parallels with the decision not to . screen a Newsnight exposé on allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy . Savile. Critics said the Comic Relief probe had . been shelved because the revelations would have damaged its fundraising . potential but the BBC insisted it simply needed more time so it could . meet its ‘robust editorial standards’. BBC director general Lord Hall and . director of news James Harding are said to have intervened personally to . ensure the documentary was rescheduled. At the Voice of the Listener . & Viewer autumn conference last week, Lord Hall said: ‘It’s James’s . programme. He wants to get it right. 'It’s quite right the director of . news has views about programmes. It’ll broadcast.’ Viewers who donated to Comic Relief will . be shocked their money was for years invested rather than going straight . to impoverished people around the world. The Panorama probe looks at how . £150million donated by the public to Comic Relief was invested for eight . years before being passed on to charities. Included in this was . £14million put into the Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund, which . invests in three of the world’s biggest cigarette firms and arms giant . BAE Systems. The six-month investigation for Panorama by independent . TV company Matchlight also suggests Comic Relief has been sitting on . £261million in shares, bonds and cash and owed £126million. Staff . costs have doubled at the charity from £7.1million a year in 2008 to . £13.5million by 2012. Last year, however, it raised £87.8million - less . than in two of the three previous years. The BBC has had long ties with Comic Relief which has been broadcast by the corporation for over 25 years . It has also emerged that the charity, which is backed by many celebrities, made a huge loss of £800,000 on a failed venture selling Gordon Ramsay-branded sauces. After the Panorama programme was initially shelved, Mr Harding is thought to have asked producers to provide more compelling evidence from their investigation before ensuring it was rescheduled. Ahead of it being aired, executives have now allegedly reviewed the programme, which looks at several charities and how they invest funds. The bosses stepped in after senior executives supposedly excused themselves from ruling on whether the programme could run. The BBC has extremely close ties with Comic Relief dating back almost 30 years. The scandal has been likened to the decision not to broadcast a programme on Jimmy Savile . The Red Nose Day and Sport Relief telethons are broadcast on the BBC and Danny Cohen, the Director of BBC TV, and directors Tim Davie and Peter Salmon are Comic Relief trustees. A BBC spokeswoman confirmed the Panorama special would be broadcast. It is expected to air on Tuesday December 10. She added: ‘BBC News and Current Affairs acts entirely independently of the wider BBC in commissioning and preparing programmes. 'It is simply wrong to suggest that the timing of the proposed Panorama investigation into the charity sector has in any way been influenced by the timing of Children in Need. ‘The planned broadcast date of this investigation was delayed until we were satisfied that the programme met our robust editorial standards and we hope to schedule the programme to air in the near future.’ A spokeswoman for Comic Relief said allegations about its investment strategy were ‘inaccurate, misleading and show a total lack of understanding of the actual position’. ‘Comic Relief takes the business of making grants and managing the money so generously donated by the public extremely seriously. ‘We’re satisfied that our approach is wholly appropriate and meets all regulatory and legal requirements. We have nothing to hide and publish a full explanation on our website.'","Documentary reportedly shelved twice by BBC bosses .

This is the terrifying moment the engine of a microlight suddenly cuts out at 300ft - forcing the rookie pilot into an emergency landing in a field. Aviator John Merriman, 53, of Somerton, Somerset, was cruising at 50 knots over the countryside when he was confronted by the life-or-death emergency. The engine on his two-seater XAir microlight stopped, bringing the propeller to a juddering halt and filling the cockpit with an eery silence. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crash: The terrifying moment a pilot crash lands in a field after the engine of his microlight cut out. The pilot was unharmed . Mr Merriman's remarkably calm response and his miraculous escape was filmed on a camera above his head in the cockpit. He sends a mayday over his headset radio and banks to the right in an attempt to glide back down. But the ground rushes rapidly towards him as the microlight falls like a stone - with overhead power lines directly in its path. Judging that he won't make it over the cables, John dips the nose at the last minute and crash-lands at almost 50 mph, just feet from a herd of cows. Flight cancellation: Aviator John Merriman, 53, was making a solo flight in his two-seater microlight aircraft above the Somerset countryside when the incident happened . Unscheduled landing: The 53-year-old's reaction is calm and immediate when it becomes clear that he will not remain airborne for long . The microlight hits a tractor rut which tears off the front undercarriage and nose cone and comes to an abrupt stop. The accident wrote-off the £5,000 machine - but John unstrapped himself and climbed from the wreckage completely unhurt. Mr Merriman, who has only been flying for six months and has 30 hours recorded time in the air, said: 'I told myself ""Don't panic - remember your training"". 'It was pretty hair-raising but I had no choice - you've only got one shot at doing it right or you're in big trouble. 'The plane will just drop out of the sky like a brick, and that will be the end of you.' Mr Merriman in the wreckage of the microlight. He is a rookie pilot but is set to gain his licence soon .

Stoic: The ground rushes up towards the microlight, but the pilot remains steely and in control . He added: 'When I saw the electricity pylon and the cables stretching across the field I knew I wouldn't make it over them. 'I dipped the nose as far as I could and descended as fast as possible. 'When I hit the ground at 50mph, the ruts in the field catapulted the plane forward and almost threw me out of the cockpit. 'I was lucky to be unhurt. I didn't even bruise a knuckle.' The part-time delivery driver had his lucky escape on October 4 as he made his second solo flight of the day above Somerton, where he has a small holding. Split-second: The moment before the plane hits the ground . Mr Merriman dipped the nose at the last minute to avoid power lines and crash-lands at almost 50mph, just feet from a herd of cows . Hair-raising: The aircraft veers sharply to the side at the impact. Mr Merriman was unhurt and flew again just weeks later . After the crash he called his wife Heather, 51, to help him carry the remains of his microlight back to their farm in their Land Rover. The aircraft was a write-off with the crank in the engine broken and the undercarriage of the fuselage damaged beyond repair. But despite his near-death experience Mr Meriman was back in the air within a few weeks after buying himself a replacement microlight. He said: 'I've only got to do a couple more hours' flight time and I'll have my pilot's licence. 'I'm certainly not hanging around on the ground too long, although I think my instructor Chris Harrison is more worried than me.'

Agnes Stephens was getting ready to be discharged from Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert, Scotland when her daughter noticed a lump on her head and bruising all over her legs. Carrie, 45, said it looked like her mother had been in a 'car crash' while nurses claimed she had 'wriggled off' a bed pan when she was left unattended. Disgusted: Carrie Stephens, 45 (far left) noticed the bruises on her mother Agnes' head while she was preparing to be discharged from Forth Valley Hospital in Larbert, Scotland . The 80-year-old was originally taken to the hospital as a precaution after she had fallen off her bed at a care home. But when Carrie arrived, she saw a lump on her mother's head and bruises down her left leg. She also discovered Agnes had fallen off a commode the day before when she read through the medical notes. Carrie said: 'My mum looked like she had been in a car crash. I was absolutely disgusted and really upset. I was frightened that her hip had been broken . 'She fell on a step in her bedroom and as a precaution she was taken to hospital to have an X-ray on her hip.

Suffering: Along with the injuries to her legs and head, Agnes' mental condition also deteriorated as a result . Carrie added: 'I was appalled at what I read. It’s all blatant lies to cover up their negligence. 'There was no medical accident report written up and the nurses had changed their story. 'There is CCTV in the department and that will show that no commode was brought into the cubicle. I could see the cubicle from where I was.

Kathryn Jones, a 55-year-old married engineer, forgot that she had ever purchased the ticket from a Shoppers Drug Mart in Cambridge, Ontario last year and went on to misplace it. So she was stunned when officials from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation knocked on her door in Hamilton to reveal that she had the jackpot - which comes to about $46.88 in U.S. dollars. 'We weren't sure we wanted to let . them in the house,' Jones said at a press conference. 'Then they showed us . their ID, so they came in and sat down and started asking a number of . questions.' Found! Kathryn Jones, 55, from Hamilton, Ontario, has been tracked down as the winner of a $CAD50 million lottery jackpot. She is pictured revealing her win at a press conference on Tuesday . Investigation: Officials from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation found out when and where the ticket was bought and identified Mrs Jones through surveillance footage . And their news - that she had become a millionaire - is still sinking in, she said. 'As you can imagine this has been a very . weird and wonderful journey,' she said during Tuesday's press conference, CTV News reported. 'I feel almost as though I have been . struck by lightning twice because first to win is pretty incredible, but . then to lose a ticket and then to have OLG find me and take the . initiative to actually contact me is also pretty incredible.' OLG President and CEO Rod Phillips explained at the press conference that officials investigated after the massive jackpot lay unclaimed last year. Excitement: Mrs Jones and her husband Richard, left, have two adult children and both work as engineers . 'A great story': Richard Jones and his wife have not yet decided what they will spend the money on . They found out when and where the winning ticket had been purchased and used surveillance footage from inside the shop to match it to the winner - Mrs Jones. Then they verified the purchase through her credit card records after she provided investigators copies. She said it was fortunate that she used her card as she usually pays cash when she plays. The investigation was further complicated when she revealed that her sister owns a shop that sells lottery tickets, sparking a review by the Alcohol and Gaming . Commission of Ontario. 'The case of this outstanding $50-million . Lotto Max jackpot is one of the most unique in OLG’s history,' Phillips . said. 'I am pleased that we are one step closer to awarding this . multi-million dollar prize.' Mrs Jones added of the investigation: 'There was no reason they needed to do this, but they did, and I'm very appreciative.' Scene: Mrs Jones was caught on surveillance footage buying the ticket at a store in Cambridge, Ontario . She said that even when she heard about the unclaimed prize, she never thought she could be the winner. She said she was busy at work and with Christmas planning so she was focused on other things. The prize will be officially presented to her in January and until then, she said she is not thinking of the money as hers. 'You . try to brace yourself for ""maybe this isn't going to happen"",' she . said. 'I am still in shock... I completely respect OLG's rules and . processes. I now anxiously anticipate the end of the wait period.' Jones said she does not know how she . will spend the money - but that her two grown children with her husband . Richard are warning her to keep her feet firmly on the ground. 'My son gave me a lecture on being . responsible,' she said, adding that her children, who are both in . university, are more concerned with getting through their exams right . now. Winnings: Mrs Jones said she still does not know where the ticket went, but assumes it's in the trash . 'It's been a great story,' her husband Richard, who is also an engineer, added to reporters. 'Who would have thought? It's only been the last few days we've known for sure.' Still now, Mrs Jones has no idea what became of the winning ticket. 'I wish I knew,' she said. 'I honestly don't know.

The family held a vigil in Massey's honor on Monday night, but it will cost more than they can afford to give Massey a proper burial, according to the family. Christian Massey was shot five times on Saturday as he ran from a mugger who had demanded his new pair of Beats By Dr Dre headphones, Massey had just upgraded his old pair (pictured) the day before . Tragic: Massey refused to give up his headphones and instead fled down this alleyway where his assailant shot him in the back five times - before the eyes of a group of children playing yards away . ‘We can't get [Christian] out of the morgue right now,’ Thelma Hodge, Massey's aunt, told Philly.com. ‘We were told it would cost between $2,200 and $2,700, according to one funeral home. It's really been a mess. Everyone is trying to deal with this and it's killing us all. Neighbors won't cooperate [with police].

But Massey refused and ran down an alleyway where his assailant shot him in the back five times – in front of a group of children playing yards away. The unknown attacker then fled the scene empty handed, leaving the headphones, which Massey had only bought on Friday, lying in the road a few inches from his body. 'To me, he was my child,' Eula Hodge, his grandmother, told NBC Philadelphia. 'Why did they have to shoot him. They didn't get what they shot him for so he was shot for nothing.' At 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weighing 305 pounds, Massey was described by those who knew him as a gentle giant.

A vaccine which could prevent HIV infection (pictured) is on the horizon, new research suggests . The finding provides the most detailed picture yet of the AIDS-causing virus’s complex structure - including parts of the virus that future jabs could mimic to elicit an immune response. About 34 million people are infected with HIV and although drugs are used to manage many cases, there is currently no vaccine that can prevent new infections. None of the HIV vaccines tested so far have come close to providing adequate protection against the virus. About 34 million people are infected with HIV and although drugs are used to manage many cases, there is currently no vaccine that can prevent new infections . This is because of the challenges posed by the ‘envelope’ protein, which is called Env. Env’s structure is so complex and delicate scientists have found it difficult to get the protein into a form that is suitable for the imaging technique necessary to study it. Professor Andrew Ward, of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), explained: ‘It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it’s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable.’ In the study, researchers created a version of Env that has the stability and other properties needed for successful imaging, but that retains virtually all the structures found on Env. Using cutting-edge imaging methods they were then able to study the new Env in minute detail. The study was the first ever of Env, and revealed the envelope’s structure in finer detail than has been reported before. The study for Science Express revealed how Env assembles and undergoes shape changes during infection, and showed how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses - such as flu and Ebola. Professor Ian Wilson, of TSRI, said: ‘Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits - but we’ve needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine.’","Scientists have begun to understand the structure of HIV's 'envelope'

'At least I know what I want to do when I retire... host ESPN SportCenter's Top 10 List,' he said while facing Mr Iger. Joke's on you: Disney chairman Bob Iger reportedly laughed at the suggestion . Sources in the room during the closed meeting said 'everyone had a good giggle' including Mr Iger, but aside from the laugh, he is not believed to have made any other remarks about the issue. It wasn't the only time he had the crowd laughing during that California trip as he went on to kid that his ears were the inspiration for that of one of DreamWorks' best-known characters: Shrek.

The controversial sweetener aspartame has effectively been cleared as safe to eat by Government experts following human feeding trials. Human guinea pigs were fed cereal snack bars, some of which contained the artificial sweetener, by a team of researchers at Hull York Medical School. The study recruited 50 people who had reported reactions after consuming aspartame in the past, such as headaches and nausea. Safe: Food Standards Agency announced that as a result of the British research, the Committee on Toxicity(CoT) had decided there is no need to ban or control the sale or consumption of the sweetener . There was also a control group of another 50 others who have eaten aspartame in food and fizzy drink over many years without any ill-effects. However, the investigation found no evidence of harm in either those who reported past sensitivity to aspartame or the control group. Significantly, this was a so-called double-blind trial where neither the trial participants or the researchers knew which of the bars was being eaten. Yesterday, the Food Standards Agency announced that as a result of the British research, the Committee on Toxicity(CoT) had decided there is no need to ban or control the sale or consumption of the sweetener. The FSA said: ‘The expert committee concluded that 'the results presented did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public'.’ The government watchdog has not released the full details of the research because they remain confidential until they have been published in a peer reviewed journal. And despite concluding there is no reason to protect consumers, the FSA said the committee had not carried out an overall safety evaluation of aspartame . A separate safety evaluation is being conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which is due to be published this month. The FSA said it will send the results of the British trial to EFSA, so they can be taken into account. The conclusions of the experts on the CoT are unlikely to satisfy the many critics of aspartame, who include Erik Millstone, Professor of Science Policy at the University of Sussex. He insists there is good quality independent research projects that have identified potential problems, ranging from premature births in women who enjoy diet drinks, to cancer. Prof Millstone, of the university’s Science and Technology Policy Research unit, believes that EFSA’s evaluation is biased in favour of aspartame. Fizzy drinks: An EU funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby . He claims the EFSA panel set up to carry out the safety assessment is dominated by experts linked to manufacturers or regulators that have previously supported aspartame. The professor pointed to several . studies that raise real questions about the safety of aspartame and . justify the need for further research. An . EU funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans . of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater . risk of having a premature baby,. It . is rare for a mother to be to give birth early - before 37 weeks - . assuming all aspects of the pregnancy have been normal. The research . found this low risk was increased by 38per cent if the woman was . drinking an average of one can of diet drink a day. The . statistics, gathered by academics in Denmark, showed that a woman who . routinely drank at least four cans a day could increase the risk by as . much as 78per cent. This meant that if the risk of a premature birth was . normally one in a 100, it increased to 1.78 in 100. The . professor also highlighted work by the independent Ramazzini Foundation . in Italy, which has published research suggesting aspartame caused . several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current . acceptable daily intake for humans. The concern about artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, relates to the fact that they contain methanol. Methanol . is a nerve toxin, which can be metabolised in the body to form formic . acid, which is another nerve toxin, as well as formaldehyde, which is . the chemical used to preserve dead bodies. All . of these research studies have formed part of the EFSA review.

Internet giant Amazon works its warehouse staff ‘to the bone’ in long and relentless shifts, a former employee claimed yesterday. Graduate Adam Littler, 23, said he walked up to 11 miles as he worked 10-and-a-half hour night shifts inside the online retailer’s giant distribution centre in Swansea. He was expected to collect a customer order every 33 seconds and told BBC1’s Panorama he was subjected to ‘unbelievable’ pressure to meet efficiency targets. Cardboard city: This Amazon distribution centre in Swansea covers 800,000 square feet. The complex is approaching its busiest time of the year . Risks: Experts have warned that conditions inside the warehouses could increases rates of mental and physical illness among workers . Amazon staff have previously revealed how they have been tracked by GPS tags inside the company’s eight UK warehouses and even had toilet breaks timed - claims the firm has denied. One employee at the warehouse - otherwise known as a ‘fulfilment centre’ - in Rugeley, Staffordshire, likened conditions to a ‘slave camp’. The American company, which employed 15,000 in its UK warehouses in the run-up to last Christmas, is currently approaching its busiest period of the year. Amazon has denied exploiting staff and said its productivity targets were set according to performance levels achieved by its work force. But experts, including Professor Michael Marmot, of University College London, have questioned if conditions inside the firm’s giant warehouses could increase workers’ risk of mental or physical illness. Targets: Adam Littler, a 23-year-old graduate, told BBC1's Panorama how he worked 10-and-a-half hour night shifts and was given an order every 33 seconds . Mr Littler wore a pedometer after he was given a job as a ‘picker’, pushing trolleys around and collecting customers’ orders from the shelves, at Amazon’s 800,000sq ft distribution centre in Swansea. Pickers are given handheld scanners which calculate the most efficient route to collect items, and tell them if they are hitting their targets. The documentary, due to be screened tonight, shows him racing to beat the scanner’s digital countdown to collect each item. ‘You all literally work to the bone and there doesn’t seem to be any reward or any let-up,’ he said. ‘I’ve never done a job like this before. The pressure’s unbelievable.’ Mr Littler was recruited via an agency for seven weeks’ work. He spent four weeks on the day shift, earning £6.50 an hour, before moving to night shifts on £8.25 an hour. He claimed he worked four nights a week for 10-and-a-half hours, including a paid half-hour break and two 15-minute unpaid breaks. Employment barrister Giles Bedloe said night shifts involving heavy physical work should be limited to eight hours in any 24-hour period. Mr Littler’s scanner set him a target of collecting 110 items per hour, but he said he rarely hit the target. After working one night shift, he said: ‘I managed to walk or hobble nearly 11 miles. I’m absolutely shattered.’ Former workers have claimed the firm imposed a ‘three strikes and release’ discipline system to sack workers who did not meet targets. Amazon has also come under pressure for its use of controversial ‘zero-hours’ contracts and for its tax avoidance practices. Figures supplied to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee showed its UK sales were £7.1billion between 2009 to 2011. But its UK company, Amazon.co.uk Ltd, paid only £2.3million in corporation tax as the majority of its sales were handled through its European subsidiary in low-tax Luxembourg. 'Unbelievable' pressure: Mr Littler was employed via an agency, and was paid £6.50 an hour to work during the day and £8.25 an hour to work at night . 'Fulfilment centre': Mr Little worked at this huge complex in Swansea, inside which staff are tracked by GPS devices . Although tax avoidance is legal, Amazon’s rivals have complained it has an unfair advantage as it can offer cheaper prices. Amazon said an independent expert had advised them that its pickers experienced similar conditions to workers in other industries and did not face an increased risk of mental or physical illness, and that its safety and illness records were better than industry competitors.

Happier: Cile Precetaj, pictured, learned late Tuesday that her case is being reviewed and she can remain in her Detroit home pending the outcome . An Albanian-born mother-of-three who on Monday was given 24 hours to leave the U.S. has been allowed to stay temporarily, after immigration officials said they would review her case. Cile Precetaj, 41, was told to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday but defied the order, choosing instead to stay home and wait for U.S. Immigrations Customs and Enforcement agents to come to her. But they never did, as late on Tuesday she learned her case was being reviewed and she can remain in her Detroit home as she awaits the outcome. 'I was just hugging my kids, saying ""thank you, thank you, thank you."" I don't have to be scared,' Precetaj told the Detroit Free Press after hearing the news. She said she is hopeful the authorities will allow her to stay in the U.S. permanently and 'raise my kids in this beautiful country.' 'I feel so glad, and I appreciate what they do for me right now,' she told FREEP. 'Hopefully, it's going to work for me and they're going to keep me here.' Precetaj came to the U.S. illegally through Canada 13 years ago fearing that if she stayed in Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She also had an abusive fiance. She immediately turned herself in and sought asylum. While here illegally, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved here 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, Mikey, 11, Migena, 6 and Martina 4, all U.S. citizens. In a statement late Tuesday, ICE confirmed the hard-working mother, who has no criminal convictions would have her case reviewed. 'ICE is presently conducting a review of Ms. Precetaj's case, therefore her removal is not imminent at this time,' agency spokesman Khaalid Walls told FREEP. Tears: Precetaj, pictured with her three U.S.-born children Mikey, 11, right, Migena, 6, center, and Martina, 4, left, was told Monday that she had to leave . Gojcevic said he hopes the government gives his wife another chance. 'Hopefully, they'll have a change of heart,' Gojcevic told FREEP. 'I hope they find it in their hearts not to split up a family.' The review comes after Precetaj's heartbreaking case made national headlines yesterday and prompted an outpouring of support. Her New York-based immigration attorney Andrew Johnson said the review was a good first step but he was still cautious. 'So far so good, though she still has an ankle bracelet on and I don't like the language that says she's not in danger of ""imminent"" deportation,' he told MailOnline, adding that he was trying to get more detailed information from officials. The concerned father said the whole ordeal has had a devastating impact on the couple's three children. 'The girls want to know why they're not going to school. They're on pins and needles,' Gojcevic said. Devastating: Cile Precetaj, pictured right, who came to the States seeking asylum 13 years ago, was ordered to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday for a flight back to her native Albania . Precetaj was ordered to report for . deportation at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday for a flight back to her native . Albania after receiving a letter from authorities Monday telling her to . pack her bags. However, . in a desperate bid to buy time, she deliberately missed the deadline, . and was waiting at home with her family for authorities to . take her into custody when she learned of the review. 'There is a level of insanity in this . case,' Johnson told . MailOnline earlier on Tuesday as he fought to keep Precetaj with her . husband and children. 'Someone is not doing what is ordinarily done. There is an abuse of power.' Precetaj . is the sole carer of her elderly mother-in-law, another U.S. citizen, . whose toes were amputated and needs help eating, walking and washing. But . her case for political asylum was rejected after a judge said her . testimony about fearing the prostitution trade and criminal activity in Albania lacked credibility. He . said even if her concerns were warranted 'young, attractive women are . not a social group for asylum.' Packing up: Precetaj, pictured center with her kids, chose not to go to the airport and remained at home with her packed bags, waiting for authorities but they didn't come . Seeking asylum: Precetaj came to the U.S. through Canada in 2000 fearing that if she stayed in Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She immediately turned herself in and sought asylum . After losing her appeal in 2008, she was given a deportation order. An estimated 500,000 people are . living in the U.S. with a deportation order, however, U.S. Immigrations . Customs and Enforcement only acts on a portion of cases and the Obama . Administration specifically said targeting people with criminal . convictions was the priority. Precetaj . has none. In fact, she's a glowing member of her community, described . by friends and her children's teachers as a hard-working mother who pays . her taxes and helps her kids with schoolwork, not to mention keeping . her elderly mother-in-law out of a government-funded home. 'Detroit . has gone off the map here,' Johnson said before the case review was announced. 'They are doing something . that has not been done around the country. This person probably has as . many positive evaluations as you can, she has three children who are . U.S. citizens and has been here for a long time. I'm just baffled.' Settled in: While here, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved here 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, including Martina, 4, pictured . Precetaj . became concerned about two weeks ago, when at her regular six-month . check in with the deportation department she was fitted with a GPS ankle . bracelet. But the mother-of-three was convinced ICE wouldn't deport a . woman whose three kids are American-born. 'That is strange they put an ankle . bracelet on a mom with three kids,' Johnson said, referring to the low . risk of her fleeing. 'Then the day before her scheduled flight they said . ""You're flying out tomorrow, here's your information."" They didn't want . the bad press. 'I . think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they . understood how egregious this case is. It just doesn't make sense.' If officials did not decide to review her case, the authorities would have been forced to collect Precetaj from her home yesterday and take her into custody. At midday Tuesday, she was pictured in her living room, with her family surrounding her awaiting ICE officers. Precetaj . and her children were crying as they hugged by the Christmas tree, and . the woman's mother-in-law was asking what would become of her if her . daughter was sent home. Other relatives, including a cousin, were . visibly upset at the heartbreaking situation the family has been thrown . into. Hugs: Precetaj has not decided, if she is in fact deported, whether to take the kids, who have never been to Albania, with her . Review: The mother's case will be reviewed . 'They will jail . her for one to three weeks, however long it takes to organize another . flight,' Johnson told MailOnline of the process. 'Then border guards will drive her to . the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she's a mass murderer . or a terrorist going to Guantanamo.' Johnson and the family were working desperately for someone in Washington D.C. to interject. 'We need somebody in the White House, connected to ICE, to say ""stop this immediately. This is wrong."" If someone in DC hears about this, that is our best chance. Her story just hasn't been heard.' Understandably, Precetaj was beside herself, and was still trying to work out if she would take her children, who are enrolled in school and have never been to Albania, with her. Her husband works as a cook at restaurant in Detroit and said he can't afford to raise the children on his own. 'She is an emotional mess,' Johnson explained. Deportation: Precetaj was informed Monday that she had to report at Deport's McNamara terminal at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday as per the above order . Empty: But the terminal, pictured, was empty at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, as the mother-of-three defied the order by staying home . 'What she has been told by numerous people was that they don't deport women with three US citizen children and that is exactly what they're doing. 'She is crying all the time, trying to work out who she can take and who she can't. She's going back to Albania and that is not a good place to bring a 6-year-old girl, particularly.' He added: 'It happened in one day, she has no idea what to do.' Gojcevic told the Detroit Free Press Monday night the family was 'hoping for a miracle.' 'Let her stay with her children and raise them in a country that they know,' he said. 'She loves this country.'","Cile Precetaj, 41, of Detroit, Michigan, learned late Tuesday that immigration officials are reviewing her case .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:33 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:57 EST, 4 December 2013 . A New Hampshire man admitted in court today that he shot dead his wife just inches away from their toddler son in a fit of rage after learning she had unfaithful to him. James Perriello, 42, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the 2012 slaying of Natalie Perriello, a popular teacher at Lebanon High School and a finalist for the state’s teacher of the year competition. Mrs Perriello, a mother of four, was discovered shot multiple times inside the couple’s home on April 26, 2012. Her husband said he had secretly taped her and discovered her affair with a former student, who was 20 years old at the time. Confession: James Perriello (left) told a judge that he gunned down his wife, Natalie Perriello (right), in front of their 3-year-old son in a spasm of anger after learning she was having an affair . Grisly scene: Mrs Perriello was found lying in a pool of blood inside her New Hampshire home after being shot six times in front of her 3-year-old son . In court Tuesday, James Perriello said he was ‘very angry’ the night he killed his wife, and he told Judge Brian Tucker he was ‘very sorry’ for what he had done. As he spoke in court, Natalie Perriello’s brother, Bob LaFlam Jr., stared at him. ‘I just couldn’t believe…what he did to those kids,’ LaFlam said after Perriello pleaded guilty. James Perriello’s parents declined to comment. The couple’s four children, ages 3 to 12 at the time of the shooting, are being raised by Natalie Perriello’s mother. Prosecutors will ask for 35 years to life in prison when he is sentenced December 18, while Perriello’s lawyer, Kimberly Cossick, will seek 18 to 36 years in prison. The Perriellos had a turbulent relationship for years, but their marital problems took a turn for the worse after the birth of their fourth child, according to court records. They had separated several months before the shooting but eventually returned home, sleeping in separate bedrooms. They went to a marriage counselor on the day of the shooting. Police said on the night of the murder, Perriello continued confronting his wife about what he had heard on the recording. Police learned through the tape that Natalie Perriello, 42, and her 20-year-old former student Joshua Towle ‘were affectionate toward one another and had initiated a relationship.’ Dangerous liaison: Natalie struck up a relationship with her former student, 20-year-old Josh Towle (left) just months before the shooting, and on the night of her death she came clean to her husband about the affair . Perriello also told police he had been monitoring his wife’s email, social media sites and text messages. The husband initially told police he went back into the bedroom with a gun to scare his wife and that it accidentally went off when she tried to grab it. He claimed the gun had a hair-trigger but a police expert testified it fired normally. The first bullet struck Natalie’s ring finger as she tried to grab for the gun. After Perriello shot her once in the head at close range, he fired five more times before letting her lifeless body drop to the floor, Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin said. One bullet was lodged in the window frame above where the 3-year-old lay next to his mother. Just days before the shooting, Perriello told several co-workers at a construction site that he believed his wife was having an affair and said at least three times that he ‘ought to just kill’ her, Strelzin told the judge. Crime of passion: Perriello said he was 'very angry' the night he killed his wife, and he told Judge Brian Tucker he was 'very sorry' for what he had done . According to New Hampshire Union Leader, Towle had been Perriello’s student at Canaan Elementary School, where she had taught for 15 years before becoming a technology teacher at Lebanon High School. The two reconnected via Facebook and text messages last year while Towle was living in California, and their relationship turned physical when the 20-year-old returned to New Hampshire just days before Perriello’s killing. Perriello said his wife told him she had fallen out of love with him, according to police testimony at a preliminary hearing last year. ‘My wife was having an affair and I just lost my cool,’ police said Perriello told a 911 dispatcher on the night of the killing. A responding officer found the body of the 42-year-old mother of four lying in a pool of blood on the bedroom floor.","Natalie Perriello, 42, was found lying in a pool of blood after being shot six times .

The police chief spoke yesterday during a panel discussion about illegal sports betting. Scroll down for video . Ranjit Sinha of the Central Bureau of Investigation, which deals with cases including rape, murder, terrorism and corruption within government. Activists called for his resignation. He said the remarks were out of context . He told delegates that if the state was unable to stop gambling, it may as well make money by legalising and taxing it. 'Do we have the enforcement?' he was reported to have said yesterday. 'It is very easy to say that if you can't enforce it, it's like saying if you can't prevent rape, you enjoy it.' Mr Sinha, pictured with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, was accused of trivialising rape . His remark was translated in a number of slightly different ways, including as: 'If you can't prevent rape, you might as well enjoy it.' The analogy provoked outrage among opposition politicans and women's groups who accused him of 'trivialising rape'. Brinda Kara, leader of the Communist Party of India, said: 'It . is sickening that a man who is in charge of several rape investigations . should use such an analogy. He should be . prosecuted for degrading and insulting women.' Mr Sinha apologised today in a statement and said his comments had been taken out of context. 'I regret any hurt caused,' he said. 'I gave my opinion that betting should be legalised and that if the laws . cannot be enforced, that does not mean that laws should not be made. 'This . is as erroneous as saying that if rape is inevitable one should lie . back and enjoy it. I reiterate my deep sense of regard and respect for . women and my commitment for gender issues.' But Kavita Krishnan, an activist with the All India Progressive Women's Association, called for Sinha to step down. 'How can he remain the head of India's premier investigation agency?' she said. Nirmala Sitharaman, spokeswoman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, called the remarks 'shocking', adding on Twitter: 'Wonder if his colleagues in the Bureau, his family and well-wishers approve of his view.' There were protests across India after a 23-year-old woman was brutally and fatally gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi last December. Four men were sentenced to death by hanging over the attack, with another one dying in custody before the trial. A sixth male, a juvenile, was sentenced to three years in a reform facility. Pictured: Ranjit Sinha. The remarks come at a bad time for his organisation, the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is accused of being a tool to pressure political rivals and is having its legality challenged in court . The lawyer for Ram Singh, who was one of the six accused of the New Delhi gang rape, speaks to reporters in March after it emerged Singh died in custody.

Rick Dominicks had an unexpected visitor in his back yard over Thanksgiving weekend and it wasn't a distant relative. The East Naples man discovered a 12-foot long carnivorous Burmese python sliding around in the bushes looking for it's next meal. Dominicks was already suspicious after five of his chickens disappeared in only one week. 'I didn't know what could have been getting the chickens,' Dominicks told NBC 2. Scroll Down For Video . Rick Dominicks shot the 12-foot python to avoid becoming its next meal--though experts say to call a professional . 'I guess [the snake] could be one of the culprits.' After three of Dominick's landscapers told him they discovered a Burmese python when they were cleaning out his backyard, Dominicks grabbed his shotgun and went after predator. 'I didn't want him to get a hold of me,' he told Fox 4 news reporters. As soon as Dominicks left his house, he discovered the slithery visitor hiding beneath some greenery. 'I was just scooping leaves off the top of him when he popped his head up and was right there,' Dominicks said. Dominicks didn't hesitate to shoot the snake because he knew that pythons are not docile creatures. Burmese Pythons have curved claws that make it easier for them to suffocate and consume prey . Fox 4 spoke with wildlife expert Steve Masek who told them that pythons are one of the largest snakes in the world.

The OPCW also wants nearly 800 tons of dual-use chemicals, many of which are common industrial chemicals, to be removed by Feb. 5 and later destroyed by private companies as part of the organization's ambitious plan to completely eradicate Syria's chemical weapons program by mid-2014. Uzumcu said in a statement 35 private companies have applied so far to participate and are at an early stage of being vetted. He also called on governments of the 190 countries that belong to the OPCW to contribute funds to the effort, or by contracting directly with companies to help destroy chemicals. Sigrid Kaag said that 'the weapons will not be destroyed in territorial waters' Kaag, who is due to travel to The Hague by Monday, said the mission will require international contributions in terms of packaging material, other logistic needs and special equipment needed to get the job done.She said the Dec. 31 deadline can be met, but unforeseen obstacles — such as a closure of the Homs-Damascus road — could delay the mission's jobThe OPCW was given the responsibility of overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal under an agreement reached between the U.S. and Syrian ally Russia on Sept. 14. The U.S. then shelved plans for a military strike on Syria's government as punishment for a chemical weapons attack Aug. 21 that killed hundreds of people, including many children, in rebel-held Damascus suburbs. Syria's government acknowledged it possessed chemical weapons and committed to giving them up. Members of the United Nations investigation team take samples from sand near a part of a missile that is likely to be a Syrian chemical rocket . Since then OPCW is scrambling to meet ambitious deadlines for disarming and destroying Syria's estimated 1,300-ton arsenal, which includes mustard gas. Syria's production capacity was destroyed or rendered inoperable by the end of October, the OPCW said, and now it is tackling the tougher problem of how to deal with its existing weapons and hazardous chemicals.An initial plan to destroy chemicals and weapons in a third country was rejected after no nation was willing to accept the hazardous waste. The possibility of destroying chemicals and weapons in Syria itself was rejected as unworkable amid the country's civil war.In Saturday's statement, the OPCW said a suitable US naval vessel 'is undergoing modifications to support the operations and to accommodate verification activities by the OPCW.' The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the ship in question is likely the MV Cape Ray, which would destroy chemical materials using a process developed by the Pentagon but never employed in an actual operation.Citing several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to identify themselves, the AP reported the U.S. plans to use what it calls a mobile Field Deployable Hydrolysis System to process the chemical material, making it unusable as weapons. The system was developed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which is an arm of the Pentagon. Its titanium reactor uses heated water and chemicals to neutralize hazardous materials.According the officials, two of the hydrolysis units would be mounted on the Cape Ray under the current plan.The OPCW's executive council met Friday night and a general meeting of member states begins Monday.","The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons, Ahmet Uzumcu, announced that the US government will contribute a 'destruction technology, full .

The stone arrangement, which includes rocks weighing up to two tonnes, was erected by Tom Mason and his son Richard on their estate in Rothbury, Northumberland. But the history enthusiasts have been bombarded by confused tourists asking which century the arrangement dates back to after they put the stones on display six months ago. Unique garden display: Tom Mason and his son Richard have built their very own Stonehenge on the grounds of their family farm in Rothbury, Northumberland . Richard said: 'Quite often we’d come back from work and there would be a walker stood there, looking at his Ordenance Survey map, scratching his head. 'We’d stop and have a bit of a chat and they’d ask if this was an ancient place of worship. I’d say my ancestors built it - my father put it up six months ago. 'Both my father and I have a real interest in local history and my headmaster was well-known rock art expert, Stan Beckinsall. 'Every single lesson he would revert back to talking about stone circles, so I blame him for my interest.' Unusual: Tourists visiting Rothbury, Northumberland, have been left baffled by the display . Richard and Tom have received calls and . emails from history societies across the country, who have been . questioned by tourists over the historical nature of the stones. 'To the untrained eye the stones could be mistaken for being a lot older,' said Richard. 'But when you look closely you can tell they’ve been quarried in the last few years.' As early as 3300 BC, arrangements of standing stones began to be erected around Britain. The most famous is Stonehenge in Wiltshire. But contrary to popular belief, Stonehenge was not built by the Druids. It is believed that construction of Stonehenge started in 2600 BC and was completed in 2000 BC. Heavy work: Some of the stones are up to seven feet tall and weigh up to two tonnes . But some more outlandish theorists claim . the stones are UFO landing pads or observatories for a highly evolved . class of astronomer priests. All experts agree that stone circles are of pre-Christian date, but beyond that stone circles have proven difficult to date accurately. Dubbed Rothbury’s very own Stonehenge, Richard says his stone circle has a number of fundamental differences to the famous World Heritage Site. He said: 'We’ve got no objections to people asking if they can sit on the stones, have a cup of tea, and eat their picnics. 'My friends who own farms nearby and have a sense of humour like myself, quite fancy a stone circle for themselves.'","Tom Mason and his son Richard have created their own Stonehenge .

Lazy chefs everywhere will be breathing a sigh of relief now that there is a new kitchen gadget that can stir your food for you. The Stirio, which operates using a wind-up motor, can stir a pot of food completely unassisted for 45 minutes. Efficient: The Stirio, which operates using a wind-up motor, can stir a pot of food unassisted for 45 minutes . As kitchen gadgets go, there is no end of pointless inventions out there, from automatic kitchen towel dispensers to corn on the cob strippers. But the Norwegian company behind the Stirio, Unikia, claim there is nothing as effective or useful on the market and has already sold 60,000 of them. They said inspiration for the Stirio came from their love of porridge, which is eaten at various meal times during the cold winter months in the Scandinavian country, and needing something to stir it continually. Norwegian company Unikia said inspiration for the product came from staff members' love of porridge . The gadget can also be used for risottos, which, as keen kitchen cooks will know, requires constant stirring, stews and chillis. It comes with adjustable axle and arms so can fit in to any size pan, and has two speed settings depending on what you are cooking. The team who came up with the idea said similar products have been invented but none is available in Europe. Project manager, Jørgen Solstad, said: ‘We had tried other stirrers that barely managed to stir sauces. We wanted a true helper in the kitchen, that could stir anything. It needed to be powerful, but simple enough that anyone could use it.’ The product runs on rechargeable batteries and can be taken apart and washed in the dishwasher. The Stirio also promises not to leave anything stuck at the bottom of the pan. Mr Solstad added: ‘We also wanted it to be as versatile as possible, as people have different needs, and not to forget, different pots. 'The axle, the arms and the blades are all adjustable, so Stirio will fit onto all standardized pots and will stir all the way out to the edges, ensuring that nothing will burn ever again. ‘We ended up with a product that we can be proud of. It’s a real helper in the kitchen, it can stir anything, leaving you free to enjoy your time.’ The Stirio costs £41.50 which includes a charging station.","The Stirio can stir a pot of food completely unassisted for 45 minutes .

Although Snowden was not named in the NSA memo, his leaks have caused the agency serious problems . Conversation round the dinner table at Thanksgiving can be a testing time for some families, especially if your in-laws do not agree with your line of work. But employees of the beleaguered National Security Agency need not have worried, after the organisation distributed a two-page list of talking points that would be suitable for holiday small talk. The document, sent out on November 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving, appears to have been compiled to help employees defend the organisation, which has been hit by a series of intelligence leaks from Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower. The document states that employees of the NSA, as well as the Central Security Service, are allowed to 'share the following points with family and close friends.' The five points, which are divided into sub-sections and do not mention Mr Snowden by name, include: ' (1) NSA's mission is of great value to the Nation... (2) NSA performs its mission the right way - lawful, compliant, and in a way that protects civil liberties and privacy... '(3) NSA performs its mission exceptionally well. We strive to be the best that we can be, because that's what America requires as part of its defense in a dangerous world... NSA's mission is of great value to the Nation: part one of the five-part memo which lists what employees are allowed to discuss at the dinner table with family and friends . '(4) The people who work for NSA are loyal Americans with expert skills who make sacrifices to help protect the freedoms we all cherish... '(5) NSA is committed to increased transparency, public dialog, and faithful implementation of any changes required by our overseers.' In the first part of the Talking Points memo, obtained by Firedoglake, the NSA suggests highlighting that programmes protecting Americans and its allies have help thwart 54 terrorist events since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the majority of which have been in Europe. More than a dozen had a 'homeland nexis'. In one of the five sections, the NSA emphasises that those working for the agency are 'loyal Americans'.It further states: . That figure has previously been challenged by opponents of the NSA. A similar Talking Points memo obtained by Al Jazeera in October also found that the NSA encouraged pushing 9/11 as a justification for its surveillance tactics. The memo moves on to emphasise that the NSA does not target US citizens 'unless that targeting is premised on a finding of probable cause to believe that the person is a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power.' Unfortunately in the third section, whoever wrote the memo misspells the word 'terrorists', instead typing 'Terrorsts'. It concludes by encouraging Americans to work with the agency 'to work with us to define the way ahead in balancing transparency and national security.'The Talking Points memo came before Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian newspaper, appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committe in Parliament.Mr Rusbridger, 59, told the committee during a heated evidence session that the newspaper had published approximately one per cent of the files they obtained from Mr Snowden.

Colditz the Christmas turkey could have graced the Royal family's dinner table this year - but instead he decided to make a run for it. After being loaded onto an abattoir-bound lorry in North Wales, the organically-bred bird managed to give farmer Gareth Williams the slip when part of the back door became unlatched. Unfortunately for the fleeing turkey, his escape route ended in the garden of the farmer's mother-in-law who found him outside her front door. Bird with plenty of pluck: Colditz the turkey courageously jumped from an abattoir-bound lorry in North Wales . Gareth Williams, who works at the farm on the Rhug Estate in North Wales, was left baffled when he discovered he was one turkey down on arrival at the slaughterhouse . However, Mr Williams, 52, was so impressed by the bird's escape that he decided it to spare it from the chop, calling it Colditz in recognition of its daring escape. The farmer, who works at the farm on the Rhug Estate in Corwen - where Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall source their Christmas turkeys - was left baffled when he discovered he was one turkey down on arrival at the slaughterhouse. The poultry farmer said: 'I was obviously shocked to see the door was open and then unfortunately had to deal with all the paper work. 'It is 70 miles to the abattoir so I didn't expect to see the turkey again. I was just thankful that only one of the birds had managed to escape.' But Colditz didn't disappear. In fact he turned up in the village of Llangollen, near the home of Mr Williams's mother-in-law, Pam Owen. Mr Williams said: 'I got a phonecall from my mother-in-law, Pam, and she said that a turkey had been found in the village. Stay of execution: The organically bred turkey was destined for Christmas dinner but managed to flee when a part of the truck door became unlatched . Escape artist: Gareth Williams pictured on the Rhug Estate with Colditz the turkey . When the farmer thought his turkey was gone forever, the Colditz wandered into his mother-in-law's garden and was recaptured . 'I said ""well that's a coincidence as I am missing one"". They had heard it pecking around their courtyard and even on the front door.' Mr Williams travelled to his in-laws and took the turkey back to the farm where hundreds of turkeys are bred for Christmas every year. Lord Newborough with Colditz the turkey named after the Nazi prison camp his owner's father was interned in . Owner of the Rhug Estate, Lord Newborough, found the turkey's escape attempt hilarious - and helped decide the name of the intrepid bird. He said: 'The turkey has become a bit of a mascot for the Rhug organic farm and he should be safe from this Christmas. 'My . father escaped a Nazi prison camp in World War Two but was captured and . sent to Colditz, so we thought that would be a fitting name for the . turkey. ' The previous Lord .

A 'fairytale' dress that once belonged to Princess Diana has sold for more than £100,000 at auction. The ornate gold and white gown, designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, features sequins, crystals and pearl beads and was worn by Diana on several occasions, including the premiere of James Bond film The Living Daylights. It was sold by Kerry Taylor Auctions in London for £102,000, including buyer’s premium, having been estimated to reach between £50,000 and £80,000. There was a huge amount of interest from the US but a museum based in another overseas country made the successful bid. Fairytale: The ornate gown, right, designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, worn by the Princess of Wales in 1986, left, sold at Kerry Taylor Auctions in south London . Kerry Taylor said: 'This is the 11th Princess Diana dress that I have sold this year, and I feel very lucky and privileged. 'It is a beautiful dress, worn by a beautiful woman, and deserved to do well.' The auctioneer described the dress as having a 'pretty, fairytale princess feel to it' and added that the dress’s current owner 'is pleased that the gown will be preserved for others to enjoy in years to come'. It is not yet known where the gown’s new home will be. Expensive: The dress was expected to fetch between £50,000 and £80,000 at auction, but went for more than £100,000 . Diana first saw the dress at a Red Cross benefit fashion show in summer 1986, and rather than having it specially commissioned from the designers, she was happy to take the standard size 10 dress from the show. She wore it at a banquet at the German ambassador’s residence in London in July 1986, and to the Royal Opera House for a performance of Ivan The Terrible by the Bolshoi Ballet later the same month, as well as to the film premiere in Leicester Square the following year. The dress was part of the Emanuels’ Diaghilev collection, which was inspired by Leon Bakst’s geometric designs for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. According to the auctioneer, Elizabeth Emanuel said that because of its lavish decoration and striking gold and white colours, the dress was something that people would either love or hate and she remembered that the Princess told her she 'loved it'. Her former husband David is currently on I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! on ITV. The Emanuels were a fashion favourite of the Princess and they made special ensembles and evening gowns for Diana’s overseas tours with the Prince of Wales, as well as producing maternity wear for her.","Ornate gold and white gown was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel .
