A canny police sniffer dog refused to be thrown off the scent by two crooks after they smashed a bottle of aftershave to distract him following the fastest car chase ever seen in Britain. Brave Axel and his handler PC Gez Cotter tracked down criminals Ben Westwood, 33, and Gregory Simpson, 26, who had led police on a dangerous 180mph 65-mile pursuit on the M6 near Wolverhampton. The thieves had carried out 15 smash-and-grab raids across the Midlands in their one of a kind Audi with a Lamborghini engine and race car brakes, stealing £50,000 of cigarettes, cash and jewellery. Super sniffer: Axel refused to give up the chase to find Ben Westwood and Gregory Simpson who smashed a bottle of aftershave in a failed attempt to hide from the star dog . Axel and PC Cotter were called on to find Westwood and Simpson after they dumped the £85,000 car outside a block of flats in the town of Wednesfield. As the crime fighting pair entered the foyer PC Cotter, 43, quickly noticed the stench of a bottle of aftershave Westwood and Simpson had smashed at the bottom of the stairs to cover their scent. But for super-nosed Axel it was no problem as he quickly led his handler up two flights of stairs and into the flat where the two crooks were found cowering under a bed. Chase: Ben Westwood, left, and Gregory Simpson, right, were jailed for a total of 13 years thanks to Axel's incredible sense of smell . Good friends: PC Cotter has spoken with pride about Axel and his determination to catch criminals whatever the circumstances . The pair was caught on January 13 after police officers spotted him . and his gang attempting to break open a cash machine at a Murco petrol . station in Penn, West Midlands. Three of the gang were arrested at the scene but Westwood and Simpson managed to flee in the car. When officers seized the car, which had been resprayed black and . disguised with a false plate, they discovered it had clocked up 1,500 . miles since it was stolen. Dynamic duo: PC Cotter and Axel arrived at the flats to the stench of aftershave on the stairs, but the dog raced up and found the crooks cowering under a bed .

Team: Axel and PC Cotter were called to find Westwood and Simpson after they dumped a £85,000 super-car outside a block of flats . PC Cotter says Axel’s nose is now well-known across Britain for being pretty unique among police dogs.He has worked with the dog for two years, and said Axel was so good he was called upon nationally to track down high-risk missing persons. 'When we got into the public foyer of the flats I saw a bottle of aftershave smashed at the bottom of the stairs, they clearly thought they could hide their scent or even attempt to injure Axel,' he said. 'But he wasn’t fazed at all and lead me straight up two flights of stairs right to the door of the flat they were in before finding them hiding under a bed. 'Criminals will sometimes try all sorts of tricks but a bottle of Old Spice wasn’t going to stop Axel getting his man.' PC Cotter said Axel’s skill with his nose had already earned him a commendation from a coroner. He said: 'In December last year we were called to Cumbria to search for a missing person thought to be in a canal lock. 'Divers had not been able to locate anything but despite 20 feet of water and frozen ground Axel indicated where it was straight away, his nose is pretty unique.'","Ben Westwood, 33, and Gregory Simpson, 26, had driven at 180mph for 65 miles to evade police in the fastest pursuit ever seen in Britain .

French first lady Valerie Trierweiler is at the centre of another furious debate about her role after it was revealed she may be about to host her own TV show. The 47-year-old lover of President Francois Hollande is regularly accused of a conflict of interest because she remains on the staff of the glossy celebrity magazine Paris Match. Ms Trierweiler has her own office and staff at the Elysee Palace, with critics suggesting that she should choose between being the partner of a head-of-state and a journalist. Job offer: Valerie Trierweiler (pictured here with her lover, France's president Francois Hollande, right, during a visit to the Louvre in Paris on Wednesday) has been offered a role presenting a programme on French TV . Power: Ms Trierweiler (right) has been accused of having a conflict of interest as First Lady to President Hollande (left) because of her job as a journalist. Commentators now fear a new role in TV will give her even more influence . Influence: Ms Trierweiler (pictured here on the right with Culture minister Aurelie Filippetti) was at the Louvre to attend the opening of new galleries for the Department of Islamic Arts . But today Canal Plus confirmed ‘informal contact’ with Ms Trierweiler to discuss hosting a cultural programme every two months. She has TV experience, having worked on a similar Saturday programme on Direct 8 in the past. One of her earliest assignments, in 1992, involved securing an exclusive interview with Segolene Royal, a minister and Mr Hollande’s then girlfriend, after she had given birth to the couple’s daughter. The interview, broadcast from a hospital, was later found to have been set up by Mr Hollande, to the annoyance of Ms Royal, who was too tired and drugged-up to complain. Now Ms Royal and Ms Trierweiler are even more bitter enemies, after Ms Trierweiler sent an infamous tweet supporting one of Ms Royal’s political rivals to win a parliamentary seat. Ms Royal went on to lose the election, accusing Ms Trierweiler of stabbing her in the back, and effectively ending her political career. Now French commentators fear that Ms Trierweiler will have even more influence, despite the fact that she has never been elected. Ms Trierweiler (seen her with Minister for Industrial Recovery Arnaud Montebourg at the Department of Islamic Arts) has been a controversial figure since Mr Hollande was elected president . In response to the growing scandal, Bruno Roger-Petit, the distinguished Paris political analyst, said that Ms Trierweiler’s proposed programme could easily include ‘artists’ who back Francois Hollande politically. Mr Roger-Petit said that even a . cultural progamme was ‘deeply political’ and that ‘it is perhaps time to . define a legal framework to give status to the partner of the President . of the Republic.’ Despite her work for Paris Match, Ms Trierweiler has had no hesitation . in going to court whenever she is featured in rival publications.

Six-year-old Will Smith was innocently playing the popular children’s video game Tiny Monsters until his grandfather Barry Slatter, 55, was contacted by the fraud squad. The family was unaware of little Will’s huge spending spree until his grandmother tried to use the credit card at Tesco, only to have it declined. Scroll down for video . Costly gaming: Six-year-old Will Smith played popular children's online game Tiny Monsters on his grandfather's iPad racking up a £2,000 credit card bill . When the fraud squad contacted Mr Slatter, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, he was horrified to discover the bill spent on the app. Tiny Monsters is a ‘breeding’ game where gamers collect and create monsters to fill their virtual island. While the game is free to download the app has 'premium currency' which gamers can buy using real money. According to the website of TinyCo, the game's creator: 'Premium Currency can be used on limited edition items, speeding up the game, and other extras.' Using his grandfather’s iTunes password, Will bought virtual food and coins costing up to £70 each while playing different levels on the game to reach the Dark Monster. Horrified: Grandfather Barry Slatter, left, was stunned when the fraud squad contacted him about the bill Will had incurred playing Tiny Monsters, pictured on iPad screen . Mr Slatter told The Mirror: ‘I must have synced my credit card up with the App Store and Will has just been pressing buttons buying baskets of food and coins for his monsters. ‘I can’t believe how easy it is for kids to buy things. Will’s only six.’ Mr Slatter said he explained the situation to Apple who agreed to a refund.

A disabled man who was trapped underneath his mobility scooter when it overturned on a busy road was forced to lie there for 30 minutes - after dozens of heartless motorists drove around him. Helpless Nickie Churchard, 26, fell off his mobility scooter after his bag got trapped on the reverse switch and caused it to topple over. But it took half an hour before someone took pity on him and came to rescue him, as cars swerved to avoid the volunteer worker. Mr Churchard was left wedged under the machine in the middle of Gold Street in Desborough, Northamptonshire, for 30 minutes after the accident on September 11. Disabled Nicky Churchard, pictured with his mother Janice Tinsley, was left trapped in the road while everyone ignored him . Shockingly passersby completely ignored Nickie’s shouts for help with some cars deliberately driving around him. Mr Churchard, also from Desborough, Northamptonshire, said: 'I felt very vulnerable and scared as cars were basically swerving round me. 'It’s not normal to see someone lying in the road trapped, but I was there for 25 minutes while cars and people passed me by. 'I shouted out to them and they just ignored me.' Nickie was left with no feeling in his left knee after a motorcycle accident in 2002. He spent three months in a coma and doctors warned his devastated mum Janice Tinsley, 55, he only had a slim chance of survival. After a hoard of pedestrians and cars failed to stop and help him, eventually a good samaritan came to his aid. Nickie pulled tendons in his leg as a result of the fall from the scooter - which happened when he was heading home from a volunteer shift at a local community centre. Disgusted mum Janice said: 'I was utterly gobsmacked. 'It’s shameful that so many people didn’t stop to help him out, and the fact that it was in our own street, where people know him, adds insult to injury. 'I am thoroughly disheartened with the lack of compassion that was shown and I was appalled by the reaction of the so-called community here. 'There was no chance of Nickie getting up on his own.

A 16-year-old boy accused of strangling his adoptive parents and hiding their bodies in the family car is to be tried as an adult, a judge has ruled. Karate black belt Moses Kamin allegedly admitted to killing his parents - Robert Kamin, 55, and Susan Poff , 50, after officers discovered their bodies in Oakland, California. Judge Morris Jacobson of Alameda County Superior Court has ruled their is enough evidence to hold the teenager - who was 15 at the time of his parents' deaths in January - over for trial. Brutal: Robert Kamin, right, and Susan Poff, left, were allegedly murdered by their adopted 15-year-old son Moses at their home in Oakland, California . The youngster is being held without bail and is scheduled to return to court on October 3, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Moses Kamin, of Oakland, California, entered a not guilty plea in Alameda County Superior Court earlier this year. Prosecutors say he confessed to killing his parents. He apparently admitted strangling his mother first with his hands and then some type of ligature during the argument. When Mr Kamin came home later that evening, the teen came up behind him and strangled him as well, prosecutors claim. The couple’s bodies were found hidden under blankets in the back of the family's car parked outside their house near Lake Merritt, which investigators believe Kamin had tried unsuccessfully to set ablaze. The bodies of Susan Poff and Robert Kamin were found in the family's car outside their home in Oakland, California . Police went to the Kamin house after their employers reported they did not show up for work. They were both civil servants. Kamin was arrested for their murder . after police discovered the couple's bodies in the car - and held at the . Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center in San Leandro. A videotape of the boy's statement to police was played during his preliminary hearing,' reports the Chronicle. His attorney, Assistant Public Defender Drew Steckler, tried . unsuccessfully to have the judge throw out the videotaped statement on . the grounds that his client did not understand his legal rights, according to the newspaper. Mr Steckler is reported to be planning to appeal that decision and to have the case . transferred to Juvenile Court. Argument: Apparently Susan Poff and Robert Kamin had argued with their teenage son about how much time he was spending at the Occupy Oakland camp . Following his arrest, colleagues of the couple told the San Francisco Chronicle that the couple had been having problems with their son, who they believed was spending too much time in the Occupy Oakland camp. Occupy Oakland is allied with New York City's Occupy Wall Street and other protests like Occupy San Francisco and Occupy San Jose. Co-workers mourned the well-known couple after news of their murders became public. Mrs Poff's boss called her death 'a terrible loss'. Joshua Bamberger told the Oakland Tribune: 'I've never met anyone who lived with as little ambivalence about making the world a better place.' Mrs Poff, who attended UC Berkley, and Mr Kamin, a graduate of Stanford University, met through friends. The couple adopted in 2002 because they were unable to have their own children, Robert Kamin's brother Bruce told the Chronicle. They had recently moved to the area and were in the middle of renovating their house.","Moses Kamin allegedly admitted killing his adoptive parents after police found their bodies .

Max MacAskill claims he spent a month in jail for a crime he did not commit because he has ginger hair . A Scottish man has claimed he spent a month in jail for a crime he did not commit simply because he has ginger hair. Max MacAskill, 25, from Dundee, had been accused of stealing games console controllers from a shop in the city. But he was actually in Berwick-Upon-Tweed on the day of the alleged crime. And despite the fact prosecutors dropped the charges against him, he ended up spending a fortnight in Perth Prison . Mr MacAskill, who has a string of previous convictions, has now claimed he was charged because Tayside Police had received reports of a shoplifter with ginger hair and automatically assumed it was him. He was only released from prison on Monday, two weeks after prosecutors dropped the charges against him. He had been accused of stealing from Game in Dundee's Murraygate on August 4. Mr MacAskill was arrested and appeared at Dundee Sheriff Court on August 6, where he denied all the charges. On August 20 prosecutors wrote to Dundee Sheriff Court saying there was no further action to be taken against him. However, rather than being released from custody, Mr MacAskill was sent back to Perth Prison where he remained until he was taken to Dundee Sheriff Court for a pre-trial hearing on Monday. He was finally released after Sheriff Alistair Duff asked why the case was being called when it had been dropped a fortnight earlier. Mr MacAskill was accused of stealing games console controllers from this Game store in Dundee . Mr MacAskill said: 'I'm quite angry. On the Saturday it was supposed to have happened me and my brother were away down in Berwick-upon-Tweed. 'When the police got me I was cycling through town and they just grabbed me off the bike. 'They said they had a report of a boy . with ginger hair shoplifting and as soon as they heard that they came . and got me. It's not fair that if any ginger boy steals they blame me. 'If they'd checked the CCTV they would have seen it wasn't me.' Mr . MacAskill said his earlier experiences of jail had made his time in . Perth Prison more bearable but that he would still be seeking . compensation for wrongful imprisonment. 'It's just a lack of them . investigating. I've been in Perth Prison a few times so it was not too . bad but it's not right I was kept in for so long. 'My solicitor says he's going to put a claim in for me. If they had just done their job properly. MacAskill, 25, spent two weeks in police custody followed by a fortnight in Perth Prison despite the fact prosecutors had dropped the charges against him . 'It's not fair that if there is anybody with ginger hair they come to get me.'It's their fault, they're not doing their checks.' He added that he was in court on August 20, the day prosecutors said there would be no further proceedings. Mr MacAskill said: 'I was in court and was in (Tayside Police headquarters) Bell Street and they obviously didn't tell G4S security. 'So it's not really their fault, it's the court's. You can't blame the jail either.' The Crown Office has refused to take responsibility for the blunder and claims the case remains under review, although a statement said the . Crown accepted Mr MacAskill's plea of not guilty on Monday. A police spokeswoman said: 'Whilst we cannot comment on individual cases, where there is sufficient evidence, a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal, and it is a decision for them whether to proceed.'","Max MacAskill, 25,was accused of stealing games console controllers from a shop in Dundee .

Scholars at Amherst College in Massachusetts believe a collector may have what would be just the second known photo of Emily Dickinson. The college says the collector, who wishes to remain anonymous, bought the photo in 1995 in Springfield. He took it to the college's archive and special collections staff in 2007, and they've been researching it ever since. Coming of age: In this, the second ever photograph of Emily Dickinson (left) is pictured with her friend Kate Scott Turner (right) Last month, it was publicly shown during the Emily Dickinson International Society conference in Cleveland, Ohio. The daguerreotype, dated around 1859, appears to show Dickinson sitting next to a friend, Kate Scott Turner. There's strong evidence it's Dickinson, including comparisons of high-resolution digital images of the newer photo with the known image, from 1847, said Mike Kelly, head of the archive and special collections department at Amherst College. Kelly said perhaps the best evidence is an ophthalmological report that compared similarities in the eyes and facial features of the women in the photos. 'I believe strongly that these are the same people,' concluded the doctor who wrote the report. Researchers are also trying to get higher resolution pictures of the dress in the picture, to see if it matches fabric samples known to belong to Dickinson. Researchers can't yet definitively say the photo is Dickinson, but 'I think we can get beyond reasonable doubt,' Kelly said. Younger life: In the only other photograph of Dickinson she is seen as a frail, teen girl . That could shift some perceptions about the Amherst native, Kelly said. For instance, a book in the 1950s was the first to propose Dickinson had a lesbian relationship with Turner, Kelly said. 'This is photographic evidence of their friendship, whatever the nature of that friendship was,' he said. The photo contradicts a misconception that Dickinson never left her house, when in fact she was quite social in her younger years, Kelly said. The revelation has got scholars at Amherst College in Massachusetts excited . It also offers a strikingly different image from the existing photo of Dickinson as a frail, teen girl, which was taken before she began writing poetry. The newer image was taken when she was roughly 30. 'This is really when she's coming into the height of her powers,' Kelly said. 'To see her as this fully mature woman rather than this sickly little girl, I think it just shifts the way people think about what she's writing.' Amherst's collections department has a copy of the daguerreotype, which it says can be viewed on request.","Only the second ever photograph of Emily Dickinson .

Like a woman at the mechanic, apparently she is just as clueless when it comes to the big, bad world of the internet. Not knowing Google from gigabytes and an email from an envelope, womankind now have the remedy to cure a case of online ignorance in a series of self-help books made just for women. The book series - available only in French - includes titles such as Internet Pour Les Nulles, which can be translated to 'Internet For Women Dummies,' targets women because apparently they need extra help managing the tricky terrain of computer hardware, software and the internet. Not knowing Google from gigabytes: A series of self-help books in French explains the internet, Macs and PCs for 'women dummies' With a tag line which translates to ‘With the Dummettes, you will no longer have anything to be jealous of men for!’ it seems women can sleep easy knowing their computer will not swallow them whole. A translation of the publisher’s summary reads: ‘Practical tips for surfing the web, communicate using email, make purchases or payments securely online, create a blog or manage photographs.’ ‘Maybe you will ask why a book on the Mac specifically dedicated to women… we give you all the advice to start surfing with confidence, communicate with all your friends through messaging, make your purchase safely, and why not, for the most daring of you, create your blog to show your beliefs loud and clear on the web!’ Clueless on computer: The internet self-help book carries the tag line 'With the Dummettes, you will no longer have anything to be jealous of men for!' The series by Françoise Otwaschkau covers PCs, Macs and the internet. While these French self-help books might not quite find their market in the UK, self-improvement books have reached cult status in Britain. While UK book sales were down recently by 1 per cent overall, sales of self-help books for the same period soared by 25 per cent. It is estimated that the cult of self-help has earned publishers some £60 million in the past five years.

Christopher Vaughn is guilty of murdering his wife and three young children, massacring them with shots to the head and chest in the family SUV in 2007. A jury took less than an hour to convict the suburban Chicago computer specialist on Thursday of carrying out the horrific execution of his family while they were on their way to visit a water park. Christopher Vaughn, 37, showed no emotion as the verdict was read. Family members of the victims cried and hugged each other in a hallway outside the courtroom immediately afterward. Family annihilator: Christopher Vaughn, 37, was found guilty of killing his wife Kimberly, 34, and then his children (left to right) Cassandra, 11, Blake, 8, and Abigayle, 12 . Prison: Vaughn had been eligible for the death penalty when the crimes were committed, but it was abolished in Illinois. He will now face life in prison without parole . Vaughn killed his family because he saw them as inconvenient obstacles to his dream of a new life subsisting in the Canadian wilderness, prosecutors told jurors on Thursday before they withdrew to deliberate.The prosecution argued he had compiled survival guides and posted wistful Internet messages about constructing a cabin and settling for good in the Yukon cut off from the world, state attorneys said. 'This case is not just a murder, it's an atrocity,' said Will County States Attorney James Glasgow. 'To annihilate your family, I can't think of a more despicable crime.' Vaughn was eligible for the death penalty when the case began, but Illinois has since abolished capital punishment. That means he faces a maximum life sentence. He is scheduled to be sentenced November 26. Just after 5am on that day, as they headed to a Springfield, Illinois, water park . from their Oswego home, Vaughn pulled the family SUV off the highway, . placed a 9mm Taurus pistol under his 34-year-old wife Kimberly's chin . and fired, prosecutors told jurors. No emotion: Vaughn was expressionless as the jury came back with guilty verdicts . Escape: Prosecutors say Vaughn saw his wife and children as obstacles standing in the way of his flight to Canada to live in the wilderness . They say he then shot 12-year-old Abigayle, 11-year-old Cassandra and 8-year-old Blake in the chest and head. 'He was held back by four major obstacles,' prosecutor Chris Regis said. 'Those four obstacles were eliminated on June 14, 2007.' Regis read emails Christopher Vaughn wrote to a friend before the murders saying he longed for a life unencumbered by cellphones and other hallmarks of modernity. He cited poet Henry David Thoreau about the virtue of shrugging off obligations. 'I just want to live plain and simple,' Vaughn wrote in one email. Tragedy: . Vaughn is seen refusing to say the names of his children (from left) Abbi, Sandi and Blake, or to look at their photos -- even crumpling up . his son's photo and throwing it in a corner . Accused: Vaughn's lawyers claim his wife Kimberly killed the children and then committed suicide . He had long since written off his wife and kids, Regis told jurors. 'He's ready to drop off the face of the earth and disappear,' he said. 'This is all about him. ... Me, me, me, me. I, I, I.' Vaughn took notes during nearly six straight hours of closings but displayed little emotion as he sat at the defense table, even when prosecutors displayed crime-scene photos of his wife, her head hanging back and dried blood from her nose and mouth. In his closing, defense attorney George Lenard repeated Vaughn's contention that his wife -- suicidal over marriage troubles and affected emotionally by antidepressant medication -- shot Vaughn in the wrist and leg, killed the children and then herself. Lenard added later that Kimberly Vaughn may have seen the murder of her kids as a twisted act of mercy. '(She) was of the mindset that they if she was gone, they were better off with her ... ""Come with me to heaven,""' Lenard said, depicting what the mother might have been thinking. Prosecutors dismissed that idea. In his closing, Mike Fitzgerald cited witnesses who testified that Kimberly Vaughn was upbeat around the time and that, just the evening before, she had fussed cheerfully over a recipe for 'cheesy potatoes.' Moreover, he asked how the wife could have just grazed her husband with two bullets as he sat right next to her -- yet somehow managed to put a bullet into each of her children's heads. 'No way, ladies and gentlemen,' Fitzgerald said. 'No way that's possible.'","Vaughn faces life in prison after Illinois abolished the death penalty .

Shops and schools were forced to close during demonstrations against a government decision to open India's retail market to foreign companies such as Tesco and Wal-Mart. The partly successful national strike saw protesters burn effigies of Prime Minister Manmohan Sing and holding signs reading ‘Go Back Wal-Mart’ whilst disrupting train services, blocking the tracks. Political backlash against the economic reform package, which also includes cuts fuel subsidies, presented by the Cabinet last week has left Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition scrambling to shore up its support and prevent early elections. Protest: Indian policemen try to remove a burning effigy representing the Indian government during a protest along railway tracks in Allahabad today . Some government allies have joined opposition parties in supporting the protests, which closed many schools and kept commercial trucks off the roads. In some states, such as opposition-ruled Gujarat, the strike was widely followed. In other regions, including the main cities of New Delhi and Mumbai, the impact of the protests was scattered. Nevertheless, the Confederation of Indian Industry estimated the country might have lost as much as £1.42 billion ($2.3 billion) in production and trade. In a signal that the government was on shaky ground, many of the protests in Uttar Pradesh state were led by the Samajwadi Party, which has been supporting the government from outside the fragile ruling coalition. Not welcome: The sign held up by a Samajwadi Party activist during the daylong strike against the retail reforms reads 'Go back Wal-Mart' The party, which has been extremely . critical of the reform package, postponed a meeting it had called for . Thursday evening to determine its next step. Top ministers downplayed any talk of a teetering government. 'We have enough friends today, we had enough friends yesterday ... so I don't see any reason why you should doubt our stability,"" Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, protesters blocked railroad tracks. Some held up placards reading 'Go back Wal-Mart,' a reference to the U.S. retail giant expected to enter the Indian market under the new regulations. The region of Jammu, an opposition stronghold, was mostly shut and in central Delhi, thousands joined protests demanding the government back down. Anti-government: Activists of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) carry a caricature of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with the words 'The blood suckers are not human beings but devils' during a protest at a bus station in Hyderabad . Law Minister Salman Khurshid said the protesters were only hurting the economy they claimed to be defending. 'I think they've shown their point, they've given their point of view, they've shown their protest,' he said. 'Now let us get back to work, back to our factories, back to our shops, back to our offices, schools and colleges.' Singh, who came under intense criticism in recent months for presiding over a corrupt and paralyzed government, stunned the country with last week's raft of reforms. The government announced a reduction in massive subsidies for diesel fuel and cooking gas. Refusal: Daily wage laborers in New Dehli lay on loaded handcarts during today's nationwide strike against the Indian government's proposals . Across the nation: An Indian man sleeps on a handcart in front of closed shops in Gauhati during the strike which saw schools and shops closed all over India . It also opened up the country's . enormous retail sector to foreign competitors, allowed local airlines to . sell stakes to foreign carriers and pledged to sell off chunks of four . state-run companies. 'It's a very difficult decision for the government,"" Information Minister Ambika Soni said. 'We have tried to assure everybody that there was no other way except to take that decision to keep the economy on track.' Opponents said the fuel hike would spark higher inflation and hurt the country's poor. They said opening up the retail sector to foreign giants would crush the nation's millions of small retail shops. 'India is heading toward economic slavery,' Rajnath Singh, a leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, said during a protest Thursday. He warned that the entry of Tesco and Wal-Mart would flood India with Chinese-made goods, hurting local farmers, manufacturers and retailers. The Trinamool Congress party announced it would pull out of the coalition Friday unless the economic package was withdrawn, leaving the ruling Congress party a few remaining hours to try to win it back. However, Chidambaram, the finance minister, said the reforms would stand. If the Trinamool Congress pulled out, India would be left with a minority government dependent on the outside support of either the Samajwadi Party or the Bahujan Samaj Party. The BSP said it would not decide until next month what action to take. Government officials said they remained confident the government would survive until the next scheduled elections in 2014.","Protesters blocked trains and burned effigies of Prime Minister Sing .

'Pack leader': Andrew Debidin, who has escaped an ASBO to reduce the numbers of dogs he owns because of his right to a family life . When Andrew Debidin moved to a new . home with his pack of nearly 50 German Shepherds, his neighbours were . understandably concerned. And they claim that their worst fears . were confirmed over the next few months when the din from nearby kennels . left them depressed and exhausted, forcing the council to seek an . Anti-Social Behaviour Order to reduce numbers and control the noise. But yesterday a sheriff dismissed the . Asbo bid and allowed Mr Debidin, who she described as the 'pack leader', . to keep all his animals. Referring to Mr Debidin’s human . rights, Sheriff Susan Raeburn ruled there was no justification to . interfere in his 'family life' with his dogs. She said that while his circumstances . were 'unusual' - Mr Dedibin sleeps with all but two of his pets in a . caravan in a remote rural compound - his lifestyle does not amount to . anti-social behaviour. The reclusive 58-year-old already has a . history of owning noisy dogs and was jailed and banned from keeping the . animals in England. The former Vidal Sassoon hairdresser . moved to the plot near Rothiemay, Moray, early one morning in 2006 after . fleeing from Ardersier, near Inverness, when Highland Council won an . Asbo against him. Last night neighbours in Moray were horrified by the court’s decision. One tearfully said: ‘I feel let down . by the criminal justice system, we put our faith in it, that it would . work something equitably but that hasn’t happened. ‘If he could find a way of living the . way he wants to live without disturbing the rest of us there would not . be any problem from the community.’ The leader of Moray Council, which tried to reduce the number of dogs to four, said he was disappointed by the decision. Allan Wright said it was wrong 'for . the sheriff to to talk about a lifestyle that centres on a man being the . leader of a pack of 46 large dogs'. It is thought the four-year legal battle could cost the taxpayer around £50,000. Mr Dedibin’s current home, the Woodhead compound, contains several caravans, and a block of 17 individual kennels. There are 46 German Shepherds on the site, which is surrounded by a six-foot high perimeter fence. Retired husband and wife David and Morag Duncan live at Core of Mayen, which is less than half-a-mile away from Mr Debidin. They were horrified when he moved in with what they thought was 'a truck load of noisy turkeys'. The Woodhead compound where Mr Debidin lives with his pack of 50 German Shepherds: Neighbours claim the noise made by the dogs has disturbed their sleep . The Duncans kept noise diaries, describing how the German Shepherds’ barking disturbed their sleep. Mrs Duncan, 66, a retired teacher, . later told Elgin Sheriff Court that the noise of the dogs was . disturbing, distressing, disruptive, exhausting and depressing. Moray Council carried out an investigation into the noise after receiving a formal complaint. Mr Dedibin was later warned that if he . allowed his dogs to bark at excessive levels, the council would apply . for an Asbo - which it did in August 2008. Environmental health officers and . acoustic experts were instructed to prepare noise level reports and . work-out how many dogs could be kept there without causing alarm or . distress. However, the sheriff said she was . bewildered as to why Moray Council chose to rely on a report that . focused on a property in Aberdeenshire that was not relevant to the . Asbo. She branded the council experts’ starting point for noise pollution as ‘inept’ as they chose a model . which was for rating industrial noise in mixed industrial and . residential areas. Sheriff Raeburn said there were other . 'perplexing and baffling' aspects to their report which called into . question its evidential value. She also said their evidence was 'remarkable in its disingenuousness'. In court, Mr Debidin denied there was a barking problem and said the noise diaries were 'lies and exaggerations'. One of Mr Debidin's dogs peers through the bottom of the six foot fence surrounding the compound: A Sheriff ruled that there were no welfare issues surrounding the dogs . In her report issued yesterday, Sheriff Raeburn said there were no welfare issues surrounding the dogs. She added that Mr Debidin had not . acted in a manner or pursued a course of conduct likely to cause alarm . or distress and that keeping his pack at the compound was reasonable. She believed neighbours had 'unreasonably low tolerance or unreasonably high sensitivity' to his animals and lifestyle. She concluded by saying: 'In my . view...the respondent’s lifestyle is deserving of respect whether or not . it falls within the legal definition of ""family life"" and in my . considered opinion, there is no justification for interference with the . respondent’s lifestyle.'","Dog breeder Andrew Debidin sleeps with all but two of his 46 dogs .

Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam risked upstaging her husband on the third day of the Liberal Democrat conference. Everywhere the Deputy Prime Minister went yesterday people seemed more interested in his wife than his latest pronouncements on tax and spending, including at a Q&A session where photographers and most eyes in the room appeared fixed on the successful lawyer - not her husband. In fact it had been the couple's 12th wedding anniversary, but instead of a night away or a romantic meal cooked by the DPM, lucky Miriam was spending it with Lib Dem politicians and delegates at the party's celebrated 'Welsh night' in Brighton. And to make it worse Sky News host Eamonn Holmes ended . an interview on live television by remarking on Miriam’s appearance, to . the obvious discomfort of the Deputy Prime Minister. Miriam Gonzalez Durantez was in the audience yesterday for her husband's Q&A session, but has now returned to London . The Cleggs yesterday celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary in Brighton . ‘Congratulations on your long lasting marriage. May I just say you have a very attractive wife,’ Mr Holmes said as Mr Clegg squirmed, replying: 'I think she will be very flattered by that. I think so.' Carrying on regardless Mr Holmes then said: 'I think he blushed at that,' and the DPM tried to end the conversation by saying simply: 'Yes'. After Mr Clegg was off screen the presenter continued the conversation with his colleague. 'She is on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, a very good picture - very good.' Viewers were surprised by the question, after a long discussion about Mr Clegg's tax plans and tuition fees apology. A source close to Mr Clegg said he was unfazed by the comment, but added: 'It was not your traditional question for an early morning tour of the TV studios.’ But Mr Holmes wasn't the only man with his mind on Miriam. In his Monday newspaper column Boris Johnson hailed her as one of . the 20 reasons to defend Mr Clegg - in a piece entitled 'we've got to save the Cleggster. Ranking her as reason number eight, he declared: ‘Miriam González . Durántez, is every bit as lovely and clever and funny as she appears.' Awkward moment: Nick Clegg was live on Sky News when host Eamonn Holmes told him he had a 'very attractive wife' Don't be glum: Nick is now on his own in Brighton after Miriam returned to London . Without a major appearance in the . conference hall, Mr Clegg had instead been wracking up photo . opportunities – though without Miriam by his side. She had returned to London to look after the couple’s three children. Touring the trade stands in the Brighton conference centre, he had a go at a steady hand game – successfully completing the buzzer toy run by the Parkinson’s Society. He later posed to have his picture taken on the Royal Mail stand. Winning face: The Lib Dem leader concentrates hard on a steady hand game . Say cheese: Nick Clegg poses in front of a picture of Brighton Pier . Earlier on a visit to an engineering firm in Brighton with Vince Cable, Mr Clegg brushed aside the support of the London Mayor who used his Daily Telegraph column to set out 20 reasons why everyone, and not just Conservatives, should be grateful help Mr Clegg to survive. Mr Johnson said the Lib Dem had ‘laid down his political life’ to form a government, even if that meant being attacked from all sides and suffering a ‘protracted political humiliation’. The London Mayor declared: ‘Never mind the badgers – save the Cleggster from extermination!’ Bring me sunshine: Vince Cable and Nick Clegg today visited the Ricardo UK Technical Centre in Shoreham-by-Sea where the Deputy PM brushed aside the backing of Boris Johnson . But Mr Clegg insisted he would not be taking tips from Mr Johnson: ‘Boris is the nation's greatest celebrity politician and he is much held aloft by the people of London. ‘He is an extremely amusing writer but I don't think I will be taking my guide from Boris about my own future.’","Everywhere the Lib Dem leader went he was dogged by questions about his wife .

Britain is facing a new winter of discontent after unions yesterday promised a campaign of strikes and civil disobedience. They have voted unanimously for co-ordinated industrial action to try to halt government cuts and ‘stick the boot in’ to the Coalition. They also called for schools and hospitals to be occupied by local residents. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, giving his speech to Congress in Brighton . At the TUC’s annual conference in . Brighton, unions agreed to ‘give full support to all groups of workers . in the private or public sector who take industrial action against cuts . or attacks on pay, jobs, pensions or conditions of service and . co-ordinating unions taking strike action’. Bob Crow, the militant leader of the . RMT transport union, said: ‘If you spit on your own, you can’t do . anything. But if you all spit together, you can drown the b******s.’ Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades . Union, said: ‘In the early years of the Thatcher government we occupied . the hospitals. That’s the sort of thing we should be demanding. ‘When they want to close down a youth . centre, when they want to close down a school or a hospital, if . communities want to occupy them, we are going to support them.’ To add to the chaos, a pensioners’ group leader, who was speaking at a TUC fringe meeting, offered support . for the campaign of civil disobedience. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, called for direct action at a fringe meeting in Brighton . Dot Gibson, of the National . Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘I am in favour of direct action, sit in . the road, things like that, go into the lobby of the town hall, mob . handed, and say we are not going to move.’ The TUC is expected to debate today . whether or not to agree to investigate the ‘practicalities’ of . organising a general strike, the first national stoppage since 1926. Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers . Association, which proposed the motion, said: ‘There are real cracks in . the Coalition at this time and I think we should stick the boot in and . finish them off. ‘The Tories aren’t embarrassed to . threaten us so we shouldn’t be embarrassed to use the ultimate weapon in . our armoury.’ Business leaders said strikes were a mistake in the midst . of the longest and deepest downturn for more than a century. Protesters march with placards in November last year in London as more than two million public sector workers staged a nationwide strike over cuts to their public sector pensions . Demonstrators marching down a road during the General Strike in 1925, the last and only time the unions have tried to bring Britain to a complete standstill . Simon Walker, of the Institute of .

It is vital that . the Government, as their employer, stands firm.’ And David Cameron’s official . spokesman warned strike threats would not persuade ministers to change . their minds over the two-year public sector pay freeze.

Ed Miliband wants all schoolchildren to study English and maths until they are 18. The Labour leader will use his speech . to the party’s annual conference today to propose an alternative to the . A-level, called the ‘technical baccalaureate’, to address the needs of . the ‘forgotten 50 per cent’ who do not go to university. Aides said it would be the biggest education reform for decades. Even those who fail English and maths . at GCSE would study the subjects as part of the ‘gold standard’ vocational qualification for less academic pupils. And A-level students who had passed . with flying colours at GCSE would have to continue to study some element . of English and maths alongside their other chosen subjects. Mr Miliband will suggest he wants to . break the dominance of the elite universities, painting a picture of a . country ‘where kids aspire not just to go to Oxford and Cambridge but to . excellent technical colleges and elite vocational institutions’. He will suggest Britain’s education . system works for only half the country, arguing that for too long both . major parties have focused too heavily on young people who go to . university. And he will highlight his own . comprehensive education in what is being billed as a highly personal . speech full of ‘class war’ rhetoric apparently contrasting his . background with that of David Cameron and George Osborne. In what will be seen as a reference to . the Prime Minister’s comfortable upbringing in the shires, Mr Miliband . will say: ‘My family hasn’t sat under the same oak tree for the last 500 . years. ‘My parents came to Britain as immigrants, Jewish refugees from the Nazis. ‘I would not be standing here today . without the compassion and tolerance of our great country, Great . Britain, a country that my parents saw rebuilt after the Second World . War.’ Speech: Ed Miliband, seen here with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on stage yesterday, will propose the changes to British education as the Labour Party conference continues in Manchester today . Labour is attempting to overhaul Mr . Miliband’s image, casting him as a man of the people who understands the . concerns of ordinary voters. The scale of the challenge is . underlined by a poll today showing only a fifth of people think he has . what it takes to be a good prime minister. Asked whether Mr Miliband could be a good leader for the country, 22 per cent agree and 63 per cent disagree. For Mr Cameron, the figures are 39 per . cent and 52 per cent. Labour’s seven-point lead in the last ComRes . survey for The Independent a month ago has also dropped to just three . points, with the party on 38 per cent to the Tories’ 35 per cent. Mr Miliband’s schooling at Haverstock . Comprehensive in Camden, North London during the 1980s is also the focus . of a Labour party political broadcast, dubbed ‘Ed: The Movie’, which . will be screened tomorrow. The campaign has divided Labour . figures, with some believing it risks backfiring as Mr Miliband’s . upbringing – as the son of Britain’s leading Marxist intellectual who . was close to many senior members of the Labour aristocracy – was far . from conventional. In today’s speech, Mr Miliband will . also suggest that businesses need to change their attitudes to overcome . the economic crisis, condemning the ‘short term’ culture in parts of . industry. And he will argue that the country has . ‘deep problems – about who Britain is run for, and who prospers in it, . about one rule for those at the top and, too often, another rule for . everyone else’.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 18:18 EST, 1 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:24 EST, 1 October 2012 . American Express is paying $112.5 million in refunds and fines to settle regulators' accusations that it charged unlawful late fees and deceived customers to pressure them to pay off old debts or buy extra credit card services. The company agreed to the settlements, which were announced on Monday by Utah regulators and four federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. American Express is refunding $85 million to about 250,000 customers and is paying $27.5 million in civil fines. Ripped off: Regulators say American Express used deceptive practices 'from the time customers signed up for a card until it began making collections' The agencies said American Express violated federal laws prohibiting deceptive practices by using false statements to get customers to settle old debts. The regulators say that included falsely telling customers that if they agreed to settlements to partially pay off their debts, the remaining balance would be forgiven. The violations were said to have occurred from 2003 to this past spring. The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, said in a statement that the company violated consumer-protection laws 'at all stages of the game -- from the moment a consumer shopped for a card to the moment the consumer got a phone call about long overdue debt.' American Express also charged late fees on some credit cards based on a percentage of the debt owed, a violation of a 2009 law prohibiting certain credit card practices, the regulators said. They said customers were sometimes led to believe they would get $300 as well as bonus points if they signed up for Amex's 'Blue Sky' credit card program. Customers who met the conditions didn't receive the promised $300, according to the agencies. Major corporation: American Express say it is the largest credit card company by volume of customer purchases . In addition, they said the company: . New York-based American Express also agreed to end the practices and to hire independent auditors to ensure the company's compliance with consumer-protection laws. The company said most of the $85 million in refunds is related to late fees and debt collection practices. Customers entitled to refunds will be notified as soon as possible, it said. Amex also said in a statement that it has put together plans to correct each of the violations cited by the regulators. 'The company is strengthening its internal compliance processes and will continue to work closely with its regulators,' the statement said. Amex also noted that it has previously set aside reserves to cover a large part of the refunds and fines. Widespread: The numerous abuses spanned the company's credit card operations, regulators said . Unlike Visa and MasterCard, which only process transactions, Amex issues its own credit cards. When customers charge more on their Amex cards, the company earns even more in interest income and a variety of fees. Amex calls itself the world's largest credit card issuer by volume of customer purchases. Also reaching settlements with the company were the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a Treasury Department agency that regulates national banks. Federal regulators are examining the sale of add-on credit card products in the financial industry overall. The alleged violations by Amex were discovered during a routine examination of the company's bank subsidiary by the FDIC and the Utah banking agency, the regulators said Monday. Parts of the investigation then were transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That agency, which began operations last year, was created by the 2010 financial overhaul law to protect consumers from excessive or hidden fees and other financial threats. Its settlement with Amex is its fourth public enforcement action. Last week, the consumer bureau and the FDIC announced an agreement by Discover Bank to refund $200 million to customers and pay $14 million in fines to resolve accusations that it pressured credit card customers to buy costly add-on services like payment protection and credit monitoring. American Express shares rose 90 cents to $57.76 in afternoon trading Monday.","Amex will repay 250,000 customers $85million as part of settlement .

Close shave: Golfer Rory McIlroy - pictured with his girlfriend, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, in April - almost failed to arrive in time for his match . Europe’s Ryder Cup team achieved one of the great golfing comebacks last night despite star player Rory McIlroy nearly failing to arrive in time for his match. In an extraordinary turnaround, they beat their US hosts 14½ to 13½ in Chicago. Overnight, they were 10-6 down and all but written off. The fightback got off to the worst possible start however when the European team realised McIlroy was not at the Medinah course ready to tee off. He had checked the start times on his phone but it was set to the wrong American time zone. And he still had not realised his mistake when a frantic call came through from his team-mates, telling him he had just 25 minutes to get from his hotel to the course. He was lucky enough to be able to hail a police car, which got him there with just ten minutes to spare. A few minutes later and the 23-year-old Northern Irishman would have been disqualified. McIlroy, who is dating tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, said: ‘I read the tee times on my phone, and they are obviously on Eastern time and it’s Central time here,’ he added. He joked: ‘At least I wasn’t in the back (of the police car). We got here as fast as we could.’ Asked how quickly he calmed down after his crazy journey, McIlroy replied: ‘As soon as I got here. 'If I warm up for 40 minutes it’s a long time anyway. I warmed up for 25 minutes before I won the (US) PGA this year. It was nearly a good thing because I did not have to think about it too much.’ Star man: Europe's Rory McIlroy hits out of a bunker on the seventh hole during the Ryder Cup on Sunday .

Emotional moment: Team Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain reacts during his speech at the closing ceremony of the 39th Ryder Cup at the Medinah Country Club . McIlroy pulled up at the clubhouse ten minutes before he and US opponent Keegan Bradley teed off. It gave him just enough time for an energy bar and a minute of practice on the putting green. Celebration: McIlroy of Nothern Ireland poses with the Ryder Cup after Europe retained the trophy . He then calmly beat Bradley to start the European surge. Team captain Jose Maria Olazabal admitted his heart was ‘racing quicker than expected’ when his main man failed to show. ‘We did not have that in mind,’ he said. ‘All of a sudden we realised Rory was not here and started to look for him. Finally we got hold of him and he came in with a police escort.’ Colin Montgomerie, who led the team to a home victory in Wales in 2010, said of the McIlroy drama: ‘That is absolutely ridiculous at this level. It’s quite unbelievable for the world number one golfer. ‘How this happened I do not know. Where is the captain? Where are the vice-captains? Where is his caddie?’ Trailing 10-6 overnight, Europe needed eight points from the day’s 12 singles matches to retain the cup. Players get a point for winning their head-to-head clashes and half a point for drawing. Dressed in the colours of the late Seve Ballesteros, Europe pulled off what will go down as the ‘Miracle of Medinah’. Olazabal, who formed with Ballesteros the greatest partnership in Ryder Cup history, cried after the victory was confirmed. ‘It means a lot – not just for me,’ he said. ‘This is for the whole of Europe, all those 12 wonderful men, my four vice-captains and that band of caddies.’","Europe's star McIlroy nearly failed to arrive in time for Ryder Cup match .

Keith Vaz could face a Commons investigation over the revelation that he held almost £500,000 in mystery bank accounts. Scotland Yard detectives found the money during a secret investigation and regarded it as being of a ‘suspicious nature’. Now the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner has received a complaint about the former Labour minister, who denies wrongdoing. He has not faced any criminal charges over the money, which was deposited between 1997 and 2001. But the claims are a major embarrassment to the Labour MP on the second day of his party’s conference in Manchester. As chairman of the home affairs select committee, Mr Vaz holds police to account on operational matters and was scathing in his criticism of Scotland Yard over the phone hacking affair. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Vaz had questions to answer. ‘I feel that he cannot continue to hold his role with the home affairs select committee during an investigation and call on him to stand down,’ Mr Bridgen added. Mr Vaz and his wife Maria Fernandes held seven bank accounts which were probed by Scotland Yard. There is no suggestion Miss Fernandes did anything wrong. In 2000, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards launched an inquiry into Mr Vaz over allegations he received money from businessmen in his Leicester constituency. The following year he was investigated for allegedly helping the billionaire Indian Hinduja brothers to obtain British passports. During quarter of century in parliament, Keith Vaz has never been far from the headlines.Born in 1956 in Aden Colony, a British colony now part of Yemen, he moved to Britain with his parents in 1965. He studied law Cambridge University and became a solicitor before becoming the youngest Labour MP in 1987 when he won the Leicester East seat. In 1999 he became the first Asian minister in the Commons when Tony Blair gave him a job in the  Lord Chancellor’s Department before being promoted to the Foreign Office as Europe Minister. In January 2001 it emerged he had contacted the Home Office about the progress of the passport applications of business tycoons Gopichand and Srichand Hinduja. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, launched an investigation into whether Mr Vaz had received any money from the Hinduja brothers. The brothers had given £1,200 to Mapesbury Communications, a company run by Mr Vaz’s wife, but he insisted he had not benefited personally. He left the government in June 2001, citing health reasons. Ms Filkin later cleared Mr Vaz of not registering the money received by his wife’s company but he was accused of failing to comply with the inquiry. In 2002 he was suspended from the House of Commons after falslely claiming a former policewoman, a friend of Mrs Vaz’s former personal assistant, had made intimidating phonecall to his mother. In further controversy it emerged he helped Nadhmi Auchi, an Anglo-Iraqi billionaire, in trying to avoid extradition to France. Despite his reputation having been seemingly tarnished, he bounced back and was appointed chairman of the home affairs select committee in 2007. When the following year the Labour government wanted to introduce 42-days detention without charge, Mr Vaz was initially against the idea but later supported it. A leaked letter from chief whip Geoff Hoon thanked him for his support, adding: ‘I trust that it will be appropriately rewarded!’ A formidable networker, he has hosted a string of celebrities at the Houses of Parliament, dancing with Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty and taking evidence from Russell Brand, Mitch Winehouse and Cherie Blair. Mr Vaz was cleared of receiving . illicit funds but was forced to resign as a minister for obstructing the . inquiry and failing to provide information relating to his finances. He was also suspended from . Parliament. Following the inquiry, a report on Mr Vaz was sent to the . National Intelligence Criminal Service. The Daily Telegraph says it has seen a . Scotland Yard document showing that the NICS stated: ‘News reports have . linked Vaz to the Hinduja brothers’ passport application affair and . imply that he may have received payments. ‘Investigations into credits in 1998 . show in excess of £58k was paid into the savings account and over £24k . into the current account. ‘These payments contain significant amounts of cash and do not appear to be salary payments. ‘In view of the allegations against . Vaz and reports that he did not fully comply with the Standards . Commissioner when questioned during the inquiry, we believe that the . level of funds received during 1998 are of a suspicious nature. ‘There are numerous unexplained . payments into the accounts and large transfers between accounts that . require further investigation.’ Scotland Yard said at least one . payment was made into a personal HSBC account from Mapesbury . Communications Ltd, a firm run by Mr Vaz’s wife. Last night Mr Vaz said: ‘The . Telegraph contacted me on Sunday about an investigation which may or may . not have occurred ten years ago. 'I asked them to supply me with a copy . of the report but they did  not have one. ‘These matters relate to two . parliamentary inquiries which began in 1999 and concluded in 2003. 'My . finances were discussed by every newspaper in the country for a period . of three years and were the subject of extensive examination. 'I have had . no outside interests. ‘The Telegraph claim the unnamed police officer states that the payments into my account were suspicious. 'They were not suspicious in any way. They relate to the sale of a family home in London, the purchase of a . new family home and a drawdown of equity from my bank. 'When you sell a house and you buy a . new house it is normal practice for the money to be paid into your . account and the money then paid out.’ Scotland Yard refused to comment on the leaked documents. A spokesman for John Lyon, the . Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, said he is considering a complaint . on the issue and a decision on whether he will launch a probe is . expected by the end of the week. Four months ago one of Mr Vaz’s former friends was booted out of the legal profession and ordered to pay £1.4million in costs. Shahrokh Mireskandari, 51, had faked . his legal qualifications and hid his criminal convictions while . representing celebrity clients. The conman was found guilty of a 104 . breaches of the rules governing solicitors’ conduct by a disciplinary . tribunal. The tribunal hearing took place after . a Mail investigation revealed Mireskandari lavished hospitality on Mr . Vaz, who publicly described him as a ‘very, very dear friend’ and also . as the ‘best lawyer in Britain’.

Failing to yield the railroad's crossing in California's Central Valley the driver of a big rig pushed two passenger cars and the locomotive off the tracks just south of Hanford where hours later a second occurred. The passenger train travelled about 600 feet after the collision before hitting a switchback and derailing, according to California Patrol Officer Scott Harris. Scroll down for video . Horrific scene: Emergency personnel respond to the scene of an Amtrak passenger train's derailment injuring at least 20 with minor to moderate injuries . Collision: Authorities say a big rig truck collided with the southbound train near Hanford, California after failing to yield to a road road crossing . Moments' reaction: The train travelled about 600 feet after the collision before hitting a switchback and derailing . The injuries sustained were minor to moderate including to the big rig's driver who authorities said was transporting 'cotton trash,' described as burrs, seeds and leaves taken from post-harvest cotton. Adding to what would be described as a 'chaotic' day for emergency crews, less than four hours later at 4pm, a second crash involving a semi and a freight train occurred. 'It’s nuts,' CHP Officer Bryan Savage who was at both scenes told the Hanford Sentinel. 'At any time, this could happen.' The second involving a silage truck transporting farm feed was approximately 17 miles north in Hanford. Both the . operators of that freight train and semi escaped serious injuries . according to a California Highway spokesperson. 'He’s . lucky,' Savage said of the second crash's driver. 'He basically had the . front end of his truck over the tracks. If he had been a little bit . more forward, it would have been a lot worse.' Rushed away: One of the train's roughly 169 passengers is seen carried away on a stretcher following the afternoon crash . Miraculous escape: The semi that was carrying cotton trash, the seeds and other debris from post-harvest cotton, is seen after the collision that left its driver with non-serious injuries . Chaos: The scene was described as a huge, chaotic scene by responding California Highway Patrol officers who managed to safely move everyone from the wreckage . Savage believes the driver misjudged the train's distance and speed with no drugs or alcohol involved. The driver was travelling less than 15 mph and the train 20-30. A cause for either crash has yet to be determined by the National Transportation Safety Board. According to Kings County Assistant Sheriff Dave Putnam the first involving the Amtrak occurred at a crossing that was equipped with control gates. The injuries to passengers were described by Putnam as bumps, bruises, scrapes and possibly broken bones. Eight . of the injured passengers were taken to Adventist Medical Center in . Hanford and five more were enroute, said hospital spokeswoman Christine . Pickering. She did not provide details on the extent of their injuries. Busy day: Keeping local emergency crews busy, less than four hours after the first collision, pictured, a second was reported involving a silage truck and a freight train . Misjudgement: The driver of the second crash, not pictured, is believed to have misjudged the train's distance and speed when crossing the tracks with no drugs or alcohol involved . Investigation: A cause for either crash, the first pictured, has yet to be determined by the National Transportation Safety Board . 'We did call in additional physicians and staff,' Pickering said. Four additional injured passengers were taken to nearby Adventist Medical Center in Selma. The train was on its way from Oakland to Bakersfield, according to Amtrak. It had four rail cars and a locomotive. 'This is a big, huge chaotic scene with lots of agencies involved,' California Highway Patrol spokesman Jerry Pierce said. Covering the scene was also the semi's cargo seen spewed inside and around the train along with metal pieces from the truck. Several pieces of luggage were also seen scattered about. The CHP will investigate the crash. Pierce said the other passengers have been taken to an auditorium in Hanford, where they will board a train and continue to their destinations or family members will pick them up. Eerily the crash was just several hours before a second semi barrelled into a freight train 17 miles away for the first. No injuries were reported in that crash.

An innocent soldier was thrown out of the Army after a comrade swapped a drugs test sample to avoid being caught for taking cocaine, a court martial was told yesterday. Lance Corporal Anthony Molloy, 29, fooled the authorities by framing  John Warren-Beck, 24, who was doing  the routine urine test at the same time, it was claimed. Despite protesting his innocence, Kingsman Warren-Beck was forced out of the Army weeks later. Court martial: Tests showed John Warren-Beck, left, had . taken cocaine and despite his protests that he had done nothing wrong, . his army career was ended prematurely. Now L/C Molloy, 29, right, is facing a court martial . Determined to clear his name, he . arranged for DNA tests to be carried out which proved the positive . sample could not have been his. A similar DNA test on Molloy proved he . was the soldier who had cocaine in his system, the court martial at . Catterick Garrison heard. 'The ultimate effect of switching the samples was the premature discharge from the Army of another soldier' Captain Chris Adair . Prosecutor Captain Chris Adair said: ‘This was a deliberate attempt to evade the repercussions of a drugs test.’ Both men were members of the 2nd . Battalion the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment based in Preston. There was . no evidence to suggest they were friends when the test took place in . August 2009. Mr Warren-Beck said he heard Molloy tell a sergeant before the test that he had taken cocaine two days earlier. ‘I heard him say it very clearly,’ he told the hearing. The two men gave samples at the same . time when an Army drugs team arrived at the barracks. The sample . containers were put on a window sill and Molloy left first, picking up . his junior colleague’s sample rather than his own, the hearing heard. Later Mr Warren-Beck saw the defendant . and allegedly said to him: ‘You had better not have swapped with me.’ Molloy is said to have replied: ‘I swear I would not do that.’ Explaining his comment, Mr Warren-Beck said: ‘I said that  to him because of what I had heard earlier.’ Test: Both men were tested at the Regiment’s headquarters at Fulwood Barracks, Preston, Lancashire in 2009 . When he returned from leave Mr . Warren-Beck was told his sample had tested positive for cocaine and he . was discharged from the Army. ‘I knew it was not right because I had not . taken any drugs,’ he said. Although he was planning to quit the Army . anyway, he said he took matters further to clear his name. DNA tests then revealed the error. Molloy is said to have become ‘visibly upset’ when told the results of . the analysis. He had agreed to the DNA tests after denying doing . anything wrong. Molloy has denied a charge of conduct . prejudice of good order and military discipline by switching his drug . test sample with another. Captain Adair told the hearing: ‘This case is . the result of the deliberate tampering of two drug test samples. The . ultimate effect of switching the samples was the premature discharge . from the Army of another soldier.’ He said that by denying the charge, . Molloy ‘is challenging most aspects of the prosecution’s case’. ‘The key . issue is whether Lance Corporal Molloy switched that sample . deliberately. We say he did, to deliberately evade the repercussions of . the drugs test.’ Cross-examined by Simon Reevell, . defending, Mr Warren-Beck admitted that at first he had suggested the . samples had been switched in error.

Broughton, pictured, denies butt-chugging and is threatening to take legal action . A University of Tennessee student who found fame after 'butt-chugging' enough wine to put him in hospital has now denied using an alcohol enema because of his religion. Alexander P. Broughton, 20, is threatening to take legal action, claiming that 'as a Christian' he would 'never desecrate his body' in such a way. He also says media reports have implied he is gay, which he isn't. Broughton was rushed to the University of Tennessee Medical Center last month unconscious with an injured rectum and a blood-alcohol level more than five times the legal limit. According to UT police, witness John Patrick Carney, from Broughton's fraternity, told officers his pal had been butt-chugging wine to get drunk faster. But in a statement, Broughton said the use of an alcohol enema was 'the most gross idea I have ever heard.' 'I would never do such a thing,' he said. 'I am a Christian who would never desecrate my body in that manner. To do so would be against God's law.' At a news conference today, Broughton's attorney, Daniel McGehee, said they intend to take legal action, though they haven't determined who the lawsuit will be against yet. McGehee accused university and hospital officials of releasing 'false and incorrect information,' according to The Knoxville News Sentinel. The lawyer also claimed the UT Police report was released in violation of federal medical privacy laws. He also said Carney now denies telling police about the 'butt-chugging', and that he would provide a sworn affidavit to support Broughton's lawsuit. Lawsuit: Attorney Daniel McGehee, left, with his client, Alexander P. Broughton, right, claims the police report of Broughton experiencing alcohol poisoning from a wine enema is false . Christian: Broughton, pictured centre, says that 'as a Christian' he would 'never desecrate his body' with a wine enema . But UT officials insist the wine enema . was the reason Broughton ended up in the emergency room, and say . evidence collected at the fraternity house after that evening's . 'blackout party' supported the claim. Following the student's near death experience, the school suspended the campus fraternity until at least 2015. The Pi Kappa Alpha house on Knoxville's campus will close on October 7 with the national fraternity notified by the university last Friday that it is voluntarily surrendering its charter. Broughton has recovered and returned to classes. Thanks . to the fraternity's drunken exploits, the bizarre way of getting drunk . is giving parents, administrators and health care workers a new fear. When . Broughton was delivered to the hospital after midnight on September 22, . his blood alcohol level was measured at 0.448 per cent — nearly six . times the intoxication that defines drunken driving in the state. Injuries to his rectum led hospital officials to fear he had been . sodomized. Closing doors: The University of Tenensee Pi Kappa Alpha chapter will close on the Knoxville campus, their house pictured, after a student's near death this month . Brink of death: Alexander Broughton, 20, was given an 'alcohol enema' during a frat party at the University of Tennessee according to police . Police documents . show that when an officer interviewed a fellow fraternity member about . what happened, the student said the injuries had been caused by an . alcohol enema, known among students as 'butt chugging.' 'It . is believed that members of the fraternity were utilizing rubber tubing . inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol,' according to a . police report. While Broughton told police he . remembered participating in a drinking game with fellow members of the . Pi Kappa Alpha chapter, he denied having an alcohol enema. Police . concluded otherwise from evidence they found at the frat house, . including boxes of Franzia Sunset Blush wine. Investigators also found three other students passed out in their rooms from drinking. 'He also had no recollection of . losing control of his bowels and defecating on himself,' according to a . university police report that includes photos of the mess left behind in . the fraternity house after the party. The university responded with swift . investigation and a decision last Friday to shutter the fraternity. The . national Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity organization also accepted the . withdrawal of the campus charter. Frat boys: The PIKE chapter at the university campus in Knoxville has been in trouble in the past for hazing . Alcohol enemas have been the punch lines . of YouTube videos, a stunt in a 'Jackass' movie and a song by the punk . band NOFX called 'Party Enema.' But Corey Slovis, chairman of department . of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said . actually going through with the deed can have severe consequences. 'It's something that offers no advantages, while at the same time risking someone's life,' he said. The procedure bypasses the stomach, accelerating the absorption rate, Slovis said. Pouring the alcohol through a funnel can increase the amount of alcohol consumed because it's hard to gauge how much is going in. 'When you're dumping it into your rectum, often via a funnel, one or two ounces seems like such a minuscule amount,' he said. Ingesting more can create unconsciousness quite quickly, he explained. The effects have been fatal in at least one case. An . autopsy performed after the death of a 58-year-old Texas man in 2004 . showed he had been given an enema with enough sherry to have a blood . alcohol level of 0.47 per cent. Negligent homicide charges were later . dropped against his wife, who said she gave him the enema. Students walking across campus this week generally responded with sighs and eye rolls when asked about the allegations. 'It's like a big joke,' said Erica Davis, a freshman from Hendersonville. 'Because who does that?' Gordon . Ray, a senior from Morristown, said the details of the case caught him . off guard, but not the fact that fraternity members would be overdoing . it with alcohol. Irresponsible: Police found empty boxes of wine strewn around the frat house along with three others passed out in their rooms from drinking . 'It is definitely over the top,' said Ray. 'But it doesn't surprise me, I don't guess.' The harm the news has done to the university's national reputation was on the mind of several students. 'If someone wants to be stupid, then they should do it where it won't affect anyone else,' said Marlon Alessandra, freshman from Independence, Va. James E. Lange, who coordinates alcohol and drug abuse prevention strategies at San Diego State University, said alcohol enemas aren't a common occurrence on campuses, though normal consumption still contributes to hundreds of student deaths annually. And many of those can be attributed to reckless attitudes about the consequences of heavy drinking, he said. 'It's not unusual to hear that students are drinking to get drunk,' he said. Lange said he hopes students don't draw the wrong lessons from the University of Tennessee incident. 'Students and people in general are pretty good at denying that they are at risk for whatever happened to someone else,' he said. 'So they can look at something like this and say 'I'm OK because I would never do that.' 'However, they may be drinking heavily, or doing things like mixing alcohol with prescription meds that is putting them at serious risk,' he said. To Tennessee freshman Cody Privett of Sevierville, there's nothing appealing about the incident on his campus. 'It's stupid, it's an unfortunate situation,' said Privett, of Sevierville. 'I mean there's partying, and then there's other things.' It is not the first time the PIKE chapter has been involved in trouble at the university. In . 2008, the chapter was placed on administrative suspension after a . hazing incident where pledges were allegedly asked to do push-ups on . broken glass. Three . students were later hospitalized with staph infections. A member of the . fraternity said pledges were asked perform a 'lateral ab movement' known . as 'bows and toes' on the bathroom floor. The university's Office of Student Judicial Affairs charged the chapter with hazing and it pleaded guilty. After . completing its suspension, the chapter served several months of . probation. The international PIKE organization investigated and kicked . out 25 of the chapter's active members.","Student Alexander Broughton, 20, rushed to hospital unconscious with blood alcohol level five times the limit .

Sibling rivalry: This three-month-old lion cub playfully taunted her older siblings, sinking her teeth and claws into her brother . Wildlife photographer Elliott Neep captured the pride playtime in stunning photographs. Mr Neep, 38, from Wantage, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It is always special to witness amazing scenes like this, and what made these images so special was the tenacity of the young cub. ‘Lions can be both the most boring and the most thrilling of animals to watch. ‘Most of the time they laze around and sleep and other times, like this, they are full of energy, chasing and fighting.’ Fearless feline: The feisty female cub quickly set about wreaking havoc after she was the first of her pride to wake from an afternoon snooze, cheekily teasing this sibling .

A carer is facing jail after being convicted of abusing three young brothers by battering them with bamboo sticks and forcing the youngest to brush his teeth with dog mess. Stephanie Chibnall, 45, cared for the boys - now aged nine, ten and 13 - after their mother had a breakdown in 2008. A court heard she regularly beat them with her fists, sticks and an electric fly swatter - leaving them covered in severe cuts and bruises. The boys would be punished for trivial reasons - including not having any homework and because they could not find Chibnall’s cigarettes. Facing jail: Stephanie Chibnall, 45, denied charges of cruelty to a person under 16 but was found guilty at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) Punishment: The youngest brother, aged nine, was forced to brush his teeth with a toothbrush that had been smeared with dog excrement (stock image) Blood was found on their school books but Chibnall covered up her beatings by lying to teachers that the injuries were just from 'boys being boys'. On one occasion, she hit one of the boys with a bamboo stick so hard that it broke - then got another implement to finish her punishment. The court heard she once discovered a tooth brush was dirty and made one of the boys cover it in dog poo and use it to clean his teeth. During another episode, one of the boys was so badly injured his teachers thought he had been in a car crash. Judge David Griffith-Jones QC, pictured, told Chibnall she was likely to face a prison sentence . The offences, which left one of the brothers with a scar half an inch long on his forehead, took place between 2008 and March 2011. The court heard her abuse eventually came to light after staff at the boys’ school grew concerned by the bruising on their bodies. Chibnall, from Gravesend, Kent, denied three charges of cruelty to a person under 16 but was convicted on Tuesday following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court. Adjourning sentence until the end of October and granting bail, Judge David Griffith-Jones QC warned Chibnall she was likely to face a jail sentence. Anthony Prosser, prosecuting, told how on one occasion, Chibnall phoned one of the boys’ schools asking for him to be excused from a Christmas play because he had fallen over and the bruising was causing him too much pain. Mr Prosser told the court: 'Staff were aware he had fallen over the day before, which had been reported and logged. 'They spoke to him afterwards. They said he had large bruises on his left upper leg from hip to knee, looking as if he had been in a car crash. 'He said he had fallen over in the playground. Staff reported their concerns.' Mr Prosser added that the boys claimed they were beaten with sticks, slapped and punched to the head while living with Chibnall. He continued: 'On one occasion, she made the youngest brush his teeth with a toothbrush smeared with dog excrement.' Mr Prosser said specialist police officers spoke to the boys individually and one claimed Chibnall hit them with sticks - including one that had a small bit of metal on the end. The prosecutor said: 'He [the boy] said she demanded to know why he didn’t always have homework. 'She picked up a stick she used to threaten dogs with and hit him on the leg and arm. 'He cried because it hurt. She told him he was being a baby.' Another time she asked him why his . room was messy and struck him, causing the boy to hit his head on the . window sill. He was left with a scar about half an inch long. Mr Prosser added: 'He went to A&E and the cut was glued. She told him to tell the nurses he had fallen off his skateboard. Evidence: Blood was found on the brothers' schoolbooks but Chibnall claimed their injuries were from 'boys being boys' (stock image) 'He spoke of another occasion when she had been angry because a toothbrush was dirty and had hairs on it. He didn’t answer and suspicion fell on him. 'She made him go out into the garden and smear dog poo on it. He didn’t tell anyone because they dared not say anything.' Another told how he was punched in the mouth when he said he did not have any spellings for homework. He had a couple of days off school and told teachers he had been hit by a swing. He said she told him not to tell anyone or she would hit him again. Chibnall denied ever assaulting the youngsters but said she had made them stand in the corner with their hands on their heads to discipline them. She claimed the stick was to control her dogs and she did not hit the children with it. She claimed to know nothing about a toothbrush incident. Under sentencing guidelines Chibnall faces up to nine years in prison for her three year reign of terror on the brothers.","Stephanie Chibnall, 45, cared for the boys - now aged nine, ten and 11 - after their mother suffered a breakdown in 2008 .

The psychotic killer was detained indefinitely in a secure mental hospital after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Sheffield Crown Court. The court heard Hobson, who has a three-year-old daughter, had suffered previous depressive episodes and was a heavy drinker. Peter Moulson, QC, prosecuting, told the court that Hobson lived with his mother Margaret and father Michael in Walkley, Sheffield. His parents had been married for 36 years.

Mr Moulson said Hobson’s mental condition worsened in the month before the killing and regulars in a local pub noticed him ‘laughing maniacally to himself for no apparent reason’ two days before the killing. The next morning he also began ‘swearing shouting and crying uncontrollably’ when he took his daughter Eva to her playgroup. British armoured vehicles in Kosovo in 1999.

Moulson said: 'In the early morning of the day of the . killing Hobson had been behaving strangely and his father noticed a . measure of aggression in him. Hobson was talking about people coming . back to life.' Mr Hobson, snr, left the house for work to ‘defuse the situation’ at 4.20am and his wife called NHS Direct.

When Hobson was arrested by police at the scene he said: 'You know I didn’t mean it'. In a report, psychiatrist John Kent said: 'This was a brutal and bizarre killing with features which cannot easily be explained other than they are likely to have formed part of some torture psychotic thinking.'

Suicide: The carjacking suspect who shot himself in the head on live television yesterday has been identified as wanted felon, Jodon F. Romero, pictured . The carjacking suspect who shot himself in the head on live television yesterday has been identified as wanted felon, Jodon F. Romero. Countless Fox News viewers were horrified as they watched Romero, 33, lead police on an hour-long high-speed car chase around midday, which ended with him getting out, putting a gun to his temple and ending his life. Phoenix Police spokesman Sgt. Tommy Thompson said today Romero was a wanted felon with a long criminal history. He said the man had numerous previous convictions for violent acts and was being hunted for violating parole for a weapons conviction. According to police, Romero stole a car at gunpoint before yesterday's dangerous pursuit and an officer fired at Romero just before he shot himself in the desert miles west of Phoenix but he apparently was not hit. Fox News was broadcasting the car chase live using a television news helicopter shot from its Phoenix affiliate KSAZ-TV. Anchor Shepard Smith, who is notorious for his car chase commentary, said: 'Umm, I don’t know. Look at this - he’s just running. Oh my. Well, it looks like he’s a little disoriented or something. It’s always possible guy could be on something.' But then, the suspect put a handgun to his head and pulled the trigger, as gasps could be heard in the Fox News control room. 'Get off,' Smith said repeatedly, urging his director to go to commercial. 'Get off it!' An ad began just after an exasperated . Smith slumped back in his chair. Coming back from commercial, Smith . told viewers minutes later that the video was supposed to be on a delay. Scroll down for video . Tense moment: Fox News was broadcasting live when the suspect ran out of the vehicle, held a gun to his head, and pulled the trigger . 'Get off it': Anchor Shepard Smith yelled for the camera to pull away from the chase, believing that the feed was on a tape delay . He then apologised, saying: 'We really messed up, and we're all very sorry.' Smith added: 'That didn't belong on TV. We took every precaution we knew how to take to keep that from being on . TV. And I personally apologize to you that that happened. 'Sometimes we see a lot of things that . we don't let get to you, because it's not time appropriate, it's . insensitive, it's just wrong. And that was wrong. And that won't happen . again on my watch. And I'm sorry.' Also apologising after the incident was the network's executive vice president of news editorial Michael Clemente. In a statement to TV Newser, . he said: 'We took every precaution to avoid any such live incident by . putting the helicopter pictures on a five second delay. 'Unfortunately, . this mistake was the result of a severe human error and we apologize for . what viewers ultimately saw on the screen.' Disturbing: The man fled and appeared disoriented after he ditched the car and began running . Running: The camera remained on the suspect as he attempted to flee . On Saturday, Sgt. Thompson said . police did everything in their power to de-escalate the situation, but . Romero seemed intent on continuing a crime spree that began with a minor . incident where he apparently hit a passing car with his hand, leading . to a call to police. As officers were heading to the south . Phoenix area, they learned that a Dodge Caliber sedan had just been . stolen at gunpoint from a nearby restaurant parking lot. They spotted the car and gave chase, . but pulled back when Romero running red lights and endangering the . public, Thompson said. Instead, unmarked cars and a police helicopter . began following him at a distance. Romero drove into an industrial area . and spotted two marked police units, with one officer standing beside . one car talking with another officer. He veered into their lane and . opened fire, missing the officers but hitting one patrol car. He then got onto Interstate 10, heading west toward California at speeds in excess of 100 mph. The police helicopter and unmarked police vehicles followed at a distance, and the Fox helicopter began its coverage. Romero fired at the police helicopter during the chase, but didn't hit it, Thompson said. About 75 miles west of Phoenix he got off the interstate and drove off into the surrounding desert. He eventually stopped, got out of the car and began walking down a dirt road. That's when an officer fired one shot at him. Although Thompson said it appear the . shot missed, television footage shows Romero stumbling and falling down . and appearing to feel his torso before waking into some brush. That's when he shot himself in the head. An autopsy will determine if he was actually shot by an officer as well. 'Get off it': Smith urged his director to go to commercial, thinking that the shooting was on a tape delay . Thompson said it was clear to officers they had to stop Romero from getting back to a populated area. 'Anybody who will shoot at police . officers, that shows a total disregard for them, will shoot at anybody . else,' he said. 'And this needed to be put to an end. Even after we . backed out all the marked units he still continued to go.' Arizona Department of Corrections records show Romero was imprisoned from April 2010 to June 2012 for a felony weapons charge. More frequently than its rivals, Fox News Channel picks up car chases from its local affiliates and airs them live. It's gripping television, a live . mystery with no clear resolution, and often provides a short-term . ratings boost as viewers tune in to see how it ends. Critics . say the chases themselves rarely rise to the level of national news. The Phoenix station was not airing the chase live when it ended. Fox's top competitors, CNN and MSNBC, did not air the chase at all. Phoenix police said the chase started with a carjacking. The man, who was not identified, then drove west on Interstate 10 for dozens of miles before getting on the dirt road.

Ahmadinejad said: 'We like and love both sides, and we see both sides as brothers.' He referred to the conflict in Syria as 'tribal' fighting and said that international 'meddling from the outside has made the situation even harder'. It was Ahmadinejad's eighth visit to the U.N. gathering held each September, which he cited as proof that he is open to understanding other countries' views. In spite of his assertions on the . importance of dialogue and respect for others, Ahmadinejad presented a . hard line in many areas.

He said: 'If he is in the U.S., you should not broadcast it for his own safety.' Rushdie, an Indian-born British novelist . who has nothing to do with the video, was condemned to death in 1989 by . Khomeini, Iran's late leader, over his novel The Satanic Verses, saying . its depiction of the Prophet Mohammad was blasphemous.

During a . historical phase, they represent minimal disturbances that come into the . picture and are then eliminated,' Ahmadinejad added. In 2005, Ahmadinejad called Israel a . 'tumor' and echoed the words of the former Iranian Supreme Leader, . Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, by saying that Israel should be wiped off . the map.

Hajizadeh said any attack on Iranian soil could trigger 'World War III'. Ahmadinejad said the nuclear issue was one ultimately between the United States and Iran, and must be resolved with negotiations. Syria grabbed the spotlight at the United Nations on Monday with a dire warning from international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi that the war is getting worse and threatening to spill across the Middle East. However he also voiced a note of hope, saying he thinks there may be a way forward despite the deadlock in the UN Security Council. Brahimi took over from Kofi Annan in September as the UN-Arab League special representative for Syria that he started to discuss with members 'the way forward'. He said the situation is still stalemated and 'extremely difficult', with no prospect to move forward 'today or tomorrow'. However he added: 'I refuse to believe that reasonable people do not see that you cannot go backward, that you cannot go back to the Syria of the past.' The Security Council, the only U.N. body that can impose global sanctions and authorize military action, has been bitterly divided by Syria's crisis. Russia, Syria's key protector, and China have vetoed three Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to halt the violence and open talks with his opponents aimed at a transition of power. Activists claim nearly 30,000 people have already died in the uprising, including in attacks on Monday by Syrian warplanes in the northern city of Aleppo. 'The nuclear issue is not a problem. But the approach of the United States on Iran is important. We are ready for dialogue, for a fundamental resolution of the problems, but under conditions that are based on fairness and mutual respect,' he said. 'We are not expecting a 33-year-old problem between the United States and Iran to be resolved in a speedy fashion. But there is no other way besides dialogue.' Iran has held several rounds of talks this year on its nuclear issue with six world powers. The six are the permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - as well as Germany. The six powers are represented by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed . Jalili said last Wednesday that he and Ashton had agreed to defer more . nuclear talks until the latter had consulted the six powers on the . sidelines of the UN General Assembly this week. On .

Ahmadinejad . is speaking at a high-level meeting on the rule of law at the United . Nations on Monday and then will address the General Assembly on . Wednesday. In the past, . Ahmadinejad has used his UN speeches to defend Iran's nuclear program . and to attack Israel, the United States and Europe. He has questioned . the Holocaust and cast doubt on whether 19 hijackers were really . responsible for the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. Western envoys typically walk out of Ahmadinejad's speeches in protest. There . will be high-level side meetings on Iran's nuclear program and the . Syrian conflict during the General Assembly, but UN diplomats do not . expect either issue to be resolved soon. Protest: New York Council Speaker Christine Quinn speaks at the Iran180 press conference outside the UN Headquarters in New York to denounce the country's nuclear program . The United Nations and Western officials have accused Iran of supplying weapons to Syria's pro-government forces, while Syria's government has accused Qatar and Saudi Arabia of arming rebels determined to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Ahmadinejad rejected the charge that Iran was sending arms to Syria. 'The so-called news that you alluded to has been denied vehemently, officially,' Ahmadinejad said in a response to a question. 'We seek peace in Syria.' A UN Security Council panel of independent experts that monitors sanctions against Iran has uncovered several examples of Iran transferring arms to Syria. The United States and Britain say they are providing non-lethal assistance to Syria's rebels such as communications equipment, but not arms. Ring of steel: New York Police officers gather near United Nations headquarters today as more than 120 heads of state meet this week for the 61st session of the UN General Assembly . Ahmadinejad also addressed the issue of a California-made anti-Islam video, The Innocence of Muslims, that has sparked anti-American protests around the Muslim world. He appeared to reject Washington's position that while it condemns the video's content, freedom of expression must be upheld. 'Freedoms must not interfere with the freedoms of others,' Ahmadinejad said. 'If someone insults, what would you do? ... Is insulting other people not a form of crime?' Since the controversy over the video erupted this month, some Muslim leaders have reiterated calls for a UN measure outlawing insults to Islam and blasphemy in general.","President said he doesn't take seriously Israel's threat to strike Iran's nuclear sites as he attended UN General Assembly in New York .

An airport employee who came face-to-face with a serial killer in the process of violently abducting his teenage victim has criticised police for not responding with any degree of urgency. The woman was the last person to see Donna Sue Wayne, 18, alive as she drove to work in the early hours of July 14, 1986. Wayne's body was found a month later dumped against a tree near Aurora, Colorado. Her killer has never been identified. Scroll down for video . Secluded: The spot on Picadilly Road near Interstate 70 outside Denver, Colorado, where an airport employee came face-to-face with a serial killer in the process of violently abducting his teenage victim in 1986 . Witness: The woman has asked for her identity to be concealed because the murderer was never caught . A team of cold-case detectives is working to uncover the serial killer, or killers, who claimed the lives of dozens of young women between 1975 and 1995. The victims were kidnapped in or around Denver and dumped at the side of rural roads outside the Colorado city. There remain 38 unsolved murders of young women fitting the pattern during that time period, when an average of two naked bodies were found abandoned each year. Detectives believe up to 11 of these killings could be linked to two convicted serial killers, but that the rest were committed by perpetrators who have never been caught. Most of the victims were teenagers or women in their early 20s who engaged in 'risky behaviour' such as prostitution or using drugs. Worryingly, police fear that one or more of the killers is still at large. Detective Marv Brandt said: 'Sexual assault, strangulation and a desire to shock police were elements that drove the killer. That person might be 60, still capable of finding more victims.' Cold-case detectives now believe that the immediate aftermath of the woman's random encounter was the best chance to solve at least one of 38 murders of young women in the Denver area between 1975 and 1995. The detectives think the killings were committed by a serial killer, or by several serial killers. The Stapleton Airport worker, who has asked for her identity to be concealed because the murderer was never apprehended, was driving along Picadilly Road near Interstate 70 outside Denver at around 5.30am on that July morning in 1986 when she saw a red car weaving around in front of her. When the car stopped in the middle of the road, blocking her progress, her vehicle's headlights illuminated a shirtless man with 'evil' eyes and a terrified girl struggling to escape. As the woman drove around the passenger side of the car, the teenager managed to open the door and stretched her arms out in her direction, begging for help. The woman told the Denver Post: ''She was saying ""Help me! Help me!"" 'He had a very intense look in his eyes. No fear. The way he looked at me, I immediately knew something was very wrong. 'I was the last person to see her alive. I had nightmares. He saw me - clearly. I saw him - clearly. And I saw her - clearly. 'And he still went on and killed her.' Cold-case investigator Marv Brandt points to the spot in Aurora where the body of Donna Sue Wayne, 18, was found a month after the airline employee saw her struggling with a man in a red car . A month after the incident, the airport employee read this newspaper story reporting that a girl's naked body had been found in Aurora, a few miles north of where she had seen the struggle take place. Incredibly, police had failed to make the connection . A 1987 newspaper clipping of Wayne's parents with a photo of their daughter a year after her murder .

Many of the bodies were dumped in the wilderness near Aurora (pictured) She quickly drove to the nearest house and alerted police. But she claims the officer responding to her emergency call said the incident was most likely a domestic fight. She believes that had police immediately launched a thorough, aggressive search for the red car they might have found Wayne before it was too late, or at the very least before her body's decomposition had destroyed vital evidence. She said: 'I was adamant this girl's life was in danger.' The officer and the woman drove up and down Picadilly Road looking for a red car - and found one parked at the side of the road with its engine still warm. But there was no way of knowing whether it was the same car and nobody was in sight. Wayne's parents reported her missing the next day. A week later her red 1972 Ford LTD was found in Aurora. A month later, the airport employee read a short newspaper story reporting that a girl's naked body had been found in Aurora, a few miles north of where she had seen the struggle take place.

Michael Fallon, who was moved into Mr Cable's department in David Cameron's reshuffle, said he wanted Britain to 'salute' wealth creation 'and stop thinking of new ways to tax it' A new Conservative business minister has said Britain should 'salute' wealthy people who risk their own money to create jobs, rather than look at new ways to tax them. Michael Fallon called for an end to the 'politics of envy in this country' and said he wanted to scrap 3,000 regulations and make it easier to sack underperforming staff. The former Tory deputy chairman and strongly pro-business MP was appointed as Vince Cable's number two as one of the key features of David Cameron's controversial reshuffle. His appointment, along with Matthew Hancock was seen as an effort to restrain Mr Cable, who has been dubbed the 'anti-business' Business Secretary by the Conservative Right. Mr Fallon suggested that there will be bruising political clashes ahead and admitted that the coalition has not done nearly enough to help boost growth. On taxing the rich, he told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We need to salute that and stop . thinking of new ways to tax it - that kind of wealth creation. That's an . attitude I want to help change. 'We need to get away from the . politics of envy in this country and salute those who not only create . wealth but risk their own money to create jobs for other people. 'Above all I want business to feel it has a strong Conservative champion in the department.' Mr Cable today  insisted he was happy to work with new Tory ministerial . colleagues. He said that cuts to red tape should be concentrated . on complex immigration and tax rules and  insisted he would not budge in his . opposition to 'fire at will' employment laws. He remained convinced of . the need to increase tax on the wealthy. Proposals for sweeping away bureaucracy are due to be published tomorrow and a new industrial policy on Tuesday as the Government continue efforts to kick-start its programme. Mr Cable told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show that he considered Mr Fallon a 'very, very able and experienced politician' with whom he could work as well as he had other Conservative colleagues. 'I like working with intelligent people with strong views. It makes politics more interesting. I have got David Willetts who is very, very able and likeable Conservative,' he said. 'We work well together. I know I will with the new team.' But he also made clear that he retained strong views in areas that could put them on a collision course. Vince Cable, Business Secretary, said that he considered Mr Fallon a 'very, very able and experienced politician' with whom he could work as well as he had other Conservative colleagues . Asked about Mr Fallon's promised bonfire of regulations, he said it would only happen if it could be done 'in a rational way' and without badly downgrading protection for employees and the environment. And he suggested that the main focus should be on immigration and tax. 'If I am allowed to wield my axe in those areas I will be delighted to do so,' he said. 'We will burn a lot of regulation but in a rational way.' He made clear that he had 'set myself very firmly' against the call for a 'no-fault dismissal' system made in the David Cameron-commissioned Beecroft Report - and pointed out that Mr Fallon was not responsible for that area. 'It is very important that we do these things in a way that does not massively undermine people's sense of security. 'That is why we are not going down the no-fault dismissal line,' insisting it had little support among businesses. And asked about Mr Fallon's comments about the 'politics of envy' that sought to tax wealth creators, he said: . 'I think wealthy people could contribute more. 'There is massive wealth inequality. I do believe that entrepreneurs should be properly supported. But I continue to believe that we need effective wealth taxation.' Mr Cable backs the introduction of a 'mansion tax' on £2 million-plus properties. Mr Fallon denied he had been parachuted into the department to 'keep an eye on Vince Cable' 'I'm there to keep both eyes on growth,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. A motion to be debated at the Liberal Democrat conference will level serious criticism at Tory efforts to water down employee rights. It complains of 'irresponsible calls for policies with no clear evidence of effectiveness, such as introducing no-fault dismissal, where the evidence suggests this would weaken confidence further'.",Michael Fallon calls for end to 'politics of envy in this country'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:01 EST, 3 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:02 EST, 3 November 2012 . A gang member who killed a promising Los Angeles High School football player because he believed the athlete's red Spider-Man backpack linked him to an opposing gang was sentenced to death on Friday. Pedro Espinoza had told authorities he was willing to kill for his gang, even if it meant going to death row. Superior Court Judge Ronald H Rose imposed that very sentence - ordering Espinoza be taken to San Quentin State Prison. Guilty: Gang member Pedro Espinoza sits in a Los Angeles court as he is sentenced to death for the 2008 murder of Jamiel Shaw II . Victim: Jamiel Shaw II, 17, was shot dead because Espinoza believed his red Spider-Man backpack, similar to the one pictured, linked him to an opposing gang . The judge rejected defence arguments that the 23-year-old didn't get a fair trial. He . said: ‘The evidence is clear he decided to murder the victim in cold . blood and bragged about the killing after. The defendant executed the . victim as he lay on the ground defenseless.’ Jamiel Shaw II, 17, was a standout running back when he was gunned down in 2008. He was not a gang member. His . parents and friends appeared in court on Friday wearing red. They said . it wasn't to symbolise a gang – but for ‘the blood spilled'. ‘You . don't have a right to execute someone and then come in and plead not to . be executed,’ said Jamiel Shaw Sr, the father of the victim. Mr Shaw said he devoted his life to preparing his son for a brilliant athletic career. He said: ‘We really thought we had a chance. My son was groomed to succeed.’ Emotional plea: Jamiel Shaw, father of the murder victim, speaks in court at the hearing where Espinoza was formally sentenced to death . Father and son: Jamiel Shaw II was a standout running back when he was gunned down in 2008. He was not a gang member . Anita Shaw, a U.S. Army sergeant, told of being in Iraq on her second tour of duty when she was summoned by her commander and told that her son had been murdered. She said: ‘I lost it.' She invoked scripture, saying she knew she was supposed to forgive – but ‘I'm not that strong of a person.’ Espinoza didn't move and didn't look at Shaw's parents as they spoke. The judge noted that Espinoza had been released from jail shortly before the killing on an unrelated charge and had been counseled by an officer who warned him of the consequences of further criminal behaviour. Rose urged the family to focus on raising their 13-year-old son, Thomas, who also attended the sentencing.

Income tax could be increased by a Labour government to fund other tax cuts, a member of Ed Miliband’s treasury team has revealed. In remarks which will risk being seen as a Labour tax bombshell, Catherine McKinnell told delegates at the party's conference that a policy review would consider a hike in direct taxes to shift the burden away from indirect charges like VAT. And in another shock move, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne today suggested universal benefits like bus passes, TV licences and heating allowances for wealthy pensioners could also be axed. Ed Miliband's speech risks being oversshadowed by his frontbench floating ideas based on Ed Ball's 'zero-based spending review' Both ideas emerged from discussions of Ed Balls’ announcement of a  ‘zero-based spending review' that will look at every pound spent by government. But the prospect of tax rises and benefit cuts could overshadow Ed Milliband’s keynote speech at the Labour conference in Manchester today, where he hopes to portray himself as in touch with voters’ concerns. Stung by criticism of a lack of policies, he will announce a series of education and economic reforms designed to present Labour as a credible alternative government. However, policy kite-flying by two shadow ministers risks undermining Mr Miliband’s relaunch. Ms McKinnell, who was promoted to the Treasury team in May, insisted nothing on tax policy was ‘set in stone’ and signalled that the burden of VAT, which Labour has long called to be reduced, could be cut if income tax rates went up. Asked if the balance between direct and indirect taxation would be looked at by Labour, she said: ‘Yes is the simple answer. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne today said the balance between between universal benefits and targeted benefits has 'got to be looked at' ‘In this economic climate, I don’t think anything is set in stone any more. 'I think everything needs to be looked at and everything needs to be considered and everything needs to be reviewed,’ she told a PoliticsHome fringe event. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday it was too early to make promises on tax: ‘We cannot make any commitments now that the next Labour government will be able to reverse particular tax rises or spending cuts. ‘Because, unlike Nick Clegg, we will not make promises we cannot keep.’ But he criticised Mr Osborne’s aborted VAT hike on pasties and caravans and later called for VAT to be cut to five per cent for a year on home improvements. Today Treasury ministers said Labour's existing proposal for a reduction in VAT from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent would cost £12.5 billion this year. Sajid Javid, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Labour have let the cat out of the bag – if elected, their plans mean a £500 tax bombshell for every person who works hard and wants to get on in life. 'Labour isn't learning. They still stand for more borrowing and more debt - and higher taxes.' Later a Labour spokesman said: 'Catherine was stating the obvious. Of course we will have to consider what we say in our manifesto on tax after this government has raised VAT, put up taxes for pensioners and cut the top rate of tax for the very richest.' Today Mr Byrne, who famously left a note in the Treasury joking that there was ‘no money left’, indicated that Labour would also re-examine universal benefits for pensioners. ‘There’s always been a balance in the welfare state between universal benefits and targeted benefits, and I’m afraid that as part of Ed’s zero-based review, that balance has got to be looked at,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Labour strategists were quick to play down the significance of the remarks, and insisted Mr Miliband would not be touching on universal benefits in today’s speech. Mr Byrne added: “I work on the assumption that we’re going to inherit a dog’s breakfast in 2015, the national debt’s going to be over £400bn higher than it was at the last Parliament. ‘Savings are going to have to be made and I think there will be savings that are needed on welfare spending too. And our challenge is how we spend that money differently to support more people.’","Shadow treasury minister says a Labour government would look at income tax rises to fund a VAT cut .

The model and actress, pictured here at London's Debenham House in 2006, is alleged to have punched a police officer . Former supermodel Paula Hamilton has been charged with punching a policeman in the chest, it was revealed today. The star is already facing a drink-driving court case following a crash near her Buckinghamshire home three weeks before the latest incident. After the crash the 51-year-old ex-model alleged she was bitten by a police dog which tracked her from the wreckage of her car found embedded in a neighbour’s conservatory. Hamilton has now been charged with attacking Police constable Dominic Matheson after he answered a 999 call reporting a domestic disturbance at the model’s home on September 29. Officers from Thames Valley Police had rushed to Hamilton’s home in a private road at Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, after the report claiming there was a domestic disturbance. It was understood that PC Matheson was investigating the complaint when he was allegedly punched in the chest by Hamilton, who was bizarrely clutching a sunflower in the other hand. The officer was not seriously hurt but Hamilton was subsequently arrested, interviewed and charged with assaulting a police officer. The ex-supermodel was the face of Volkswagen cars when she starred in a blockbuster advertising campaign in the 1980s which made her a household name. She hit the headlines again in mid-September when police were called to a crash near her home on September 4 and found her Hyundai Coupe car which had veered off the road, hit a telegraph police and demolished a fence before crashing into a neighbour’s newly-built glass conservatory. A mystery young man found injured and sitting in the passenger seat was taken to hospital as police searched for the driver who had vanished from the scene. She was found by a police dog in a nearby garden, having lost her two front teeth in the accident. The eccentric model later complained to police that she had been bitten by the police dog although it was understood no further action was taken. The supermodel became a star after an iconic 1987 VW advert . Paula Hamilton, seen here launching a swimwear collection, also appeared on Britain's Next Top Model . Police confirmed last week that proceedings had been issued against Hamilton in relation to the accident and that she had been summonsed for alleged drink-driving. She was understood to be awaiting a court appearance date. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed today that, following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, Hamilton had been charged with assaulting Police constable Matheson in relation to a domestic disturbance on September 29. 'A 51-year-old woman from Farnham Common has been charged with assault on a police officer on September 29 and released on bail to appear in court,' the spokesman said.A courts’ service spokesman confirmed that Hamilton had denied the charge at High Wycombe Magistrates’ Court and was due to face trial at Aylesbury Magistrates’ Court in February.

Plants could be given ‘passports’ under radical proposals to stop the spread of disease and prevent a repeat of the ash tree crisis. Government scientists want every plant sold in Britain and the EU to be inspected and provided with labels to guarantee they are free of pests and blight. Staff in garden centres would be responsible for issuing the ‘plant passports’, with Government inspectors visiting twice a year to conduct audits of random batches. An ash tree in Northumberland -but experts say 19 in 20 of the UKs population could die as Ash dieback spreads . If the legislation is passed, it would mean any nursery failing to comply with the passport system would not be allowed to operate. The proposal came as emergency talks in Downing Street yesterday failed to produce a strategy to deal with the ash tree dieback crisis. As reports emerged of the fungal disease spreading to Kent, the environment secretary emerged from the Government’s Cobra crisis committee meeting and stated that more analysis was needed before a solution could be found. Last night, critics dismissed the plant passport proposal as ‘academic’ and called for the Government to take urgent action to save Britain’s ash trees instead. Gardeners would foot the bill for the passport scheme, which would see all safe plants issued with a label to certify they are healthy, and all unsafe plants destroyed. The idea was outlined at another meeting of scientists by David Slawson, leader of the tree health programme at Defra’s Food and Environment Research Agency. He said: ‘Plant passport involves nurseries issuing a label which would then be stuck to the plant pot. If we protect plants this way, we will be in a better place in the future than we are now.’ He added the passports would be issued for all specimens that are ‘for planting’ – referring to potted plants rather than cut flowers and fruits. If the proposal is adopted, every country in the EU would be asked to have inspectors overseeing the issue of passports. Plants coming in from outside the EU are already required to have a certificate to prove they are safe, and a European plant passport system already exists for high-risk plants such as fruit trees, rose trees and rhododendrons. Mr Slawson said the new plan would simply mean rolling this out further – with the cost of the extra bureaucracy passed on to the customer via the grower. But Tim Briercliffe, of the  Horticultural Trades Association, said: ‘Even if you have a plant  passport, you can only sell the  plant in a pest-free area or else it may be re-contaminated. ‘It’s a bit academic at the moment, although it’s a possible help once pest-free areas have been created. An Ash tree in woodland around Durham Cathedral shedding it's leaves - as fears are rising the disease killing Ash trees is spreading . ‘As for passing the cost on to the gardener, it’s not an effective way to raise funds. The Government needs to take responsibility for it.’ Yesterday’s Cobra meeting of ministers, experts and officials heard  that a mass survey of 3,000 areas in Britain would be carried out to produce a clearer picture of the extent of the threat from ash dieback. Environment secretary Owen Paterson said afterwards: ‘We have had an assessment of the state of the disease. ‘We also had an assessment of the current survey, where we are looking at 2,900 10km squares right across the United Kingdom. Scientists are warning that the disease, which has destroyed 90% of all the Ash Trees in Denmark, could repeat the catastrophe that struck the nation's elm tree population in the last century, from which it has still not recovered. ‘We also had a presentation  on possible solutions – at the moment we do not have a cure  for the disease – and also measures we might take.’ The Forestry Commission will report back to Mr Paterson next week with a final report on how far the blight has already spread. Thought to have originated in Japan, the disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to ash tree death. It has already wiped out up to 90 per cent of ash trees in some areas of Denmark.","Experts believe the disease could be far more widespread than initially thought - with one claiming 19 out of 20 trees could die .

The number of companies going bust fell to its lowest level for seven years, it was revealed yesterday. Some 548 firms fell into administration in England and Wales between July  and September, said the Insolvency Service. That was nearly 20 per cent fewer than the same period last year and the lowest number since the first three months of 2005. Good news: The number of companies going bust fell to its lowest level for seven years, it was revealed yesterday . Despite the positive figures, economists warned that  recovery from recession will be long and slow as the crisis in the eurozone and slowdown  in the global economy take their toll. A separate survey warned that Britain’s builders face ‘a long, dark winter’ despite an upturn in fortunes in October. Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the UK faces ‘powerful economic headwinds’. But experts welcomed the fall in businesses going bust, which coincided with the end of the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. The economy grew by 1 per cent between July and September following nine months of decline. Cash-strapped companies have been helped by record low interest rates and leeway from lenders, although that has not saved black cab maker Manganese Bronze or electrical goods chain Comet. Corporate undertaker Mike Jervis, a partner at accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘We expect these lower levels of insolvencies to continue into the  New Year. Grim: The Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the UK faces 'powerful economic headwinds' ‘However, what happens after that depends crucially on the confidence of the consumer and the approach taken by the so-called zombie companies to rectify their balance sheets.’ A ‘zombie’ company is one which can pay the interest on its debts but not repay the debt itself, leaving it particularly vulnerable to a rise in  borrowing costs or a loss of business. Lee Manning, of R3, the trade body for insolvency experts, said it estimated there are 146,000 zombie businesses. He added: ‘Some of these have been running on empty for quite some time now, and with no reserves left in the tank, they may not be able to carry on for much longer.’ Personal insolvencies in England and Wales increased for the first time in a year  as more people struggled with unmanageable levels of debt. There were 28,062 personal insolvencies in the third quarter of the year, up 2 per cent on the previous three months but still 7.2 per cent lower than the same period last year. This figure could rise, said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust charity. ‘Many households are running a budget deficit of their very own, and some are relying on credit to bridge the gap,’ she added.","548 firms fell into administration in England and Wales between July  and September .

Accused: Everett Donelson wants his daughter's alleged killer, Chester Leroy Todd (pictured), to walk free to deprive him of free medical care for his Parkinson's . The father of a woman who was raped and beaten to death 16 years ago says he does not want his daughter's alleged killer to be sent to jail - but would prefer to see him free on the streets to suffer with his crippling Parkinson's disease alone . Chester Leroy Todd, 66, from Denver, has been a fugitive since 1996 when a first-degree murder warrant was issued for him in the death of mother-of-three Sheri Majors, Denver Police spokesman Sonny Jackson said. Everett Donelson says he would prefer to see authorities drop charges against the 66-year-old and let him go: 'They should just release him on the streets, in his own little walker,' he said. 'That would be a bigger punishment than being in jail where he can get free medical treatment.' Todd is suffering from end-stage Parkinson's disease and Mr Donelson believes he only confessed to Sheri's murder to witnesses so he could make use of the free medical care he would receive behind bars. The 27-year-old woman's beaten and strangled body was found adjacent to railroad tracks in downtown Denver on March 17, 1996, a day after witnesses at a pool hall saw her accept a ride from Todd. His abandoned tractor-trailer rig was discovered at a Sioux City, Iowa, truck stop days later. Evidence recovered from the truck linked Todd to Majors' murder, police said. In 2006, the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program issued a bulletin saying the agency was compiling a list of suspects in a series of rapes and murders of prostitutes who frequented truck stops in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Todd was the only one named as a suspect in the crimes. His attorney pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder on Todd's behalf so he would not have to appear in court. Fugitive: Sheri Majors' (left) raped and beaten body was discovered in March 1996. Shortly afterwards Todd (right) disappeared and had been on the run until February 2011 . Last time he appeared he complained that sitting in his wheelchair made him 'uncomfortable'. 'Uncomfortable is hearing how he killed Sheri while she was begging for mercy,' her cousin Rhonda Gans, 40, told the Denver Post. After being hospitalized in Las Vegas in February 2011, Todd confessed the murder to several witnesses. Todd, who was homeless, had been living in Las Vegas and working at a produce warehouse under the alias James Diamond.In 2006, the FBI named Todd as a suspect in a series of killings and rapes of prostitutes at truck stops across the country.

According to The Daytona Beach News-Journal she said: ‘On the night that this occurred, it had to be one of the most horrific nights of my life and most people think it was because I had a gun pointed at my face but it wasn't. 'The horrific part of this was me having to leave the house hoping to run into an officer after the gun had been pointed at my face and returning to my house where I knew I had my kids. The horrific part of this was my children.’ Circuit Judge Raul Zambrano said the ‘horrific’ incident warranted a ‘very stiff punishment’ and sentenced Harris to life in jail without parole. Judge Zambrano said: ‘You terrorised a human being by using a weapon and pointing that weapon at that human being and that, in and of itself, will cause harm. ‘It doesn't require somebody to go to the hospital or somebody to get shot, but it will cause enough fear in a human being that probably could scar them for life. ‘You escalated the situation based upon . your feelings of jealousy or wanting to be in control of another human . being, but our society does not tolerate that type of behaviour.

As far as my behalf, you know, I apologise for what took place. ‘You know, I've been praying about the situation and, you know, I forgive her as well, too.’ He then proclaimed his innocence to Judge Zambrano. He said: ‘With all due respect, sir, I understand the jury has in fact found me guilty of the alleged charges although my innocence still remains... so regardless of the years you sentenced me to, I ask sir that you consider the fact that nobody was actually harmed or hospitalised. ‘I also feel that my character was truly assassinated by the prosecutor and most definitely by the media, of which I know you have no control over.’ Harris has previously served jail time for various offences including aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, depositing cheques with the intent to defraud, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and possession of a controlled substance.","Major Harris III attacked his girlfriend, pouring root beer down her throat, pointing a gun at her eye while threatening to kill her .

Tears: Just days after staring him down in court, Lottie Spencer Blatz has spoken out about the nightmare her life became after Waseem Daker killed her friend and her friend's son . Pain: Daker, left, was convicted on Friday of a list of 11 crimes he committed in 1995, which include the murder of Karmen Smith and the stabbing of Miss Smith's son, Nick, right . 'He didn't break me,' an emotional Mr Smith told 20/20. Daker was convicted of stabbing Mr Smith 18 times when he was just five years old. 'I just feel a little more free than I did before,' he added. Both Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith had to face Daker in court, as the criminal served as his own attorney, cross-examining his victims. Mrs Blatz said she didn't want to face him for the trial, but Mr Smith's courage inspired her. 'I just kept on thinking, that poor Nick has got to confront the man that stabbed him eighteen times, and murdered his mom,' she said. 'And if he’s going to do it, I gotta be strong for him, to show him that we can do it.' Mrs Blatz said she struggled to come to terms with what transpired that tragic day. 'This is clearly something that I've held in for so long that only a few close, dear friends are aware of what I experienced at the hands of Waseem Daker,' she said, weeping. Hurt: Daker was convicted of stabbing Mr Smith 18 times when he was just five years old . Happier times: Karmen Smith is pictured with Nick in an undated family photo . During the trial, both Mr Smith and Mrs Blatz gave emotional testimony when questioned by Daker. At one point, Daker said Mrs Blatz's statements were inappropriate, to which she responded: 'It’s really inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you’re sitting here asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your questions, that’s hard for me!' 'He has no power over me.'Lottie Spencer Blatz . Mr Smith responded similarly when Daker confronted him about statements he made from his hospital bed after the attack, when he told police his mother's killer's eyes were blue. 'I was in the hospital and had gotten stabbed repeatedly by you, so I don’t really think that that was a very good time to be asking a 5-year-old questions like that,' he said, looking Daker in the eye. The jury near Atlanta began . deliberating the decision shortly before 10 a.m. Friday and returned a . guilty verdict against Waseem Daker in less than five hours. The . 35-year-old was indicted on 11 counts, including malice and felony . murder, burglary, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated . battery and attempted aggravated stalking. Convicted: Daker served as his own attorney during his trial . Daker is charged in the October 23, 1995 killing of Karmen Smith in her Cobb County home. Daker killed Miss Smith and attacked her son because he was obsessed with Lottie Spencer Blatz, who lived upstairs from them, prosecutors said. Daker was convicted of stalking Mrs Blatz in 1996. Authorities had long suspected Daker but couldn't connect him to the slaying until new DNA testing linked him to Miss Smith's death in 2009. Daker did not react as the verdict against him was read, The Marietta Daily Journal reported. Emotional: Karmen Smith's son, Nick, pictured testifying in court during the trial, was stabbed multiple times during the 1995 attack, but survived . Scene: At the time of her murder, Karmen Smith lived in the basement apartment, pictured, of the house on Old Hunter's Trace where Loretta Blatz lived in Marietta, Georgia . But several of Miss Smith's relatives and friends showed relief, including Mrs Blatz and Nick Smith, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Both Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith had testified against Daker. Jurors asked the judge during deliberations for permission to replay a portion of taped telephone conversations that allegedly occurred between Daker and Mrs Blatz on October 13 and 14, about a week before the slaying, and a portion of a taped interview Daker had with Cobb County Police Detective Brad McIntyre after the slaying. Daker objected to the jury hearing only portions of the tapes, and wanted them to hear the whole thing, but Superior Court Judge Mary Staley overruled the objection.","Waseem Daker, 35, was convicted of killing Karmen Smith and stabbing her son Nick, 5, 18 times .

The suspected jihadists were arrested by Egyptian counter terror police as they collected rocket-propelled grenades, rifles and pistols in an attempt believed to be similar to the Mumbai attacks in India which killed 166 people in November 2008.# . Authorities claimed that the gang . planned to attack the ‘softer target of British tourists’ holidaying at . the idyllic beachside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Red Sea. Terrorist target: Beachside resort Sharm el-Sheikh (pictured) is thought to have been the target of five Muslim terrorists who were arrested by Egyptian counter terror police . The arrests come after al-Qaeda . leader Ayman Zawahiri called for a new wave of violence, appealing to . jihadists around the world to attack and kidnap westerners. The Daily Mirror quoted a security source saying: ‘There are increasing fears that Zawahiri is demanding more attacks on civilian areas with a focus on Americans and Brits. ‘British security is pretty good these days so al-Qaeda is turning its attention to the softer target of British tourists who are holidaying abroad.’ The suspects were held near the border with Gaza as the weapons were taken to a safe house in Egypt. In . a separate incident, security forces arrested two men allegedly linked . to 83 bombs found by security forces in a car on a highway outside . Cairo, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. Appeal for violence: al-Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri has appealed to jihadists around the world to attack and kidnap westerners . Police also raided an apartment in Cairo and seized 1.1lbs of ball bearings, which are often used in bombs to cause greater damage and injury, and a bomb-making manual. Two other men were detained by police recently with electrical circuit boards that could have been used in bomb-making. The attack in Mumbai in 2008 occurred at 10 sites across the city with most of the 166 victims killed at the Indian city’s main train station. Attacks in Egypt have been on the rise since Salafi Islam fundamentalist groups linked to al-Qaeda have grown in Egypt’s Sinai region. Attacks have been made on UN peacekeepers, Egyptian forces, Israel and a gas pipe to Israel and Jordan.

Tourists have been targeted before by extremists in Egypt during a wave of violence in the 1990s. Some 62 tourists were massacred by six men disguised as security force staff with knives and automatic guns at an archaeological site across the Nile from Luxor in 1997. At the time, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak blamed the British government partly for the attack after the Egyptian terror chiefs responsible were given asylum in the UK. The Sharm el-Sheikh resort has been targeted before in 2005 when two car bombs went off at the centre of the resort and another in the city’s Old Market while restaurants, cafes and bars were packed, killing 88 people and wounded 150. Just last year an estimated 30,000 Britons were trapped in Egypt, the Middle East’s most populous country, split between Cairo, Luxor, Aswan and Sharm el-Sheikh as violence broke out around the country while Egyptians protested.","Five al-Qaeda terrorists were arrested by Egyptian counter terror police .

Torn: Dean Carter (pictured after his arrest in 1984) raped and almost strangled to death Rose Steward in 1984 before murdering five women, but Steward wants to spare her tormentor the death penalty . J. Rose Steward has spent the last three decades struggling to move past being raped and nearly strangled to death at the hands of a man who will go on to murder five other women. But when Steward, 50, of Colorado, heads to the polling place next week, she will cast a vote in favor of a law that will spare the life of her tormentor, Dean Carter. Steward was 22 years old and living in Ventura, California, in 1984 when she woke up on the night of March 29 to discover Dean standing in her room gripping a knife with a red bandana concealing his face. For the next five hours, then-28-year-old Dean raped and throttled her until she passed out. Steward was certain of her impending death, but she managed to outwit her assailant by pretending to like him, The Los Angeles Times reported. When he finally left in the morning, the young woman even kissed him goodbye and made him promise that he will call her. After leaving Steward, Carter went on a murderous rampage, raping and strangling five women in a matter of 18 days. Their bodies were later discovered in closets after he was arrested. Steward's unflinching testimony helped the prosecution win two death sentences against Carter. But 28 years later, the 57-year-old convicted killer remains on death row at San Quentin prison where he writes a blog called Deadman Talking about his daily life. Families of the five slain women have expressed outrage that Carter continues to live and called on the state to help them get the closure they deserve by watching him die. Steward, however, has not joined the chorus of angry voices demanding Carter's execution. Although her position has left her feeling like a traitor to the five women who died at Carter's hands  - and whom she refers to as 'sisters'  - the 50-year-old woman has endorsed Proposition 34 to replace death penalty with life sentence without parole in California.Steward said it has been difficult to move past her traumatic experience while she waits for the phone call telling her that Carter's time is up. Fate: Carter is on death row at San Quentin prison, but could be spared the institution's death chamber (pictured) if capital punishment is abolished after next week's vote. File picture . Carter's sole survivor has long opposed capital punishment, and  seeing the appeals process drag on for decades with no end in sight has only reinforced her belief that it's hard to live a full life while you await someone else to die. Yet, the 50-year-old woman had been unwilling in the past to go public with her opposition to the death penalty out of respect for the families of Carter's victims: Jillette Leonora Mills, 25, Susan Lynn Knoll, 25, Bonnie Ann Guthrie, 34, Janette Anne Cullins, 24, and Tok Chum Kim, 42. Steward told the LA Times that her reluctance stemmed in part from feelings of guilt that of all the victims, she was the only who survived - a fact that left her wondering if she could have prevented the murders, or worse still, that perhaps she was the one who had somehow triggered Carter’s murderous rampage. When Carter was arrested a month after Steward's rape, prosecutors decided to try him first for that crime and then call her to the stand to testify against him in the murder trials. When the serial killer was convicted and sentenced to death, the murdered women's families rejoiced while Steward stayed silent, feeling that it was not her place to oppose the court's decision. Blogger: Carter posts articles from his cell on death row in a blog called 'Deadman Talking' But when she read over the summer that Proposition 34 was put on the ballot in California, she wrote a note in support of the campaign to abolish the death penalty - a move that has left some of the victims' loved ones feeling betrayed. - Rose Steward on Dean Carter . In Steward's opinion, however, commuting Carter's sentence to life without parole would take away his celebrity status which he has enjoyed while on death row and help bring closure. Those who oppose the death penalty have said that aside for the obvious argument that institutionalized killing is no better than murder, doing away with death row is also a cost-cutting measure. California has spent about $4billion since capital punishment resumed in 1977, yet just 13 inmates have been put to death. An independent analysis says the state would save between $100 million and $130 million a year by converting death sentences to life-without-parole, money supporters say could be put toward public schools and local law enforcement investigations. Proponents of the death penalty, however, argue that the purported financial benefits of replacing capital punishment with life without parole are nothing more than smoke and mirrors. For Steward, it all comes down to one simple fact. 'I don't want blood on my hands like he has,' she said.","J.

There is speculation the Independent Police Complaints Commission's findings on Craig Denholm will not be made public until 2014 to avoid prejudicing criminal trials next year. If delayed, Surrey's current deputy chief constable could retire before the IPCC's verdict is published on up to £85,000 per year. Did he know? Surrey's deputy chief constable Craig Denholm (left) has been accused of knowing Milly Dowler's phone was hacked but a probe into it may not be made public until 2014 to avoid prejudicing criminal trials . He started his career started in 1984 and officers can leave their jobs after 30 years, with Mr Denholm likely to take home up to two-thirds of his £128,000 annual salary for the rest of his life. Surrey Police has already admitted it knew for nine years before it became public that Milly's voicemail had been hacked while she was still missing, but never told Scotland Yard when they ran their first phone hacking investigation in 2006. The . now defunct News of the World admitted hacking the 13-year-old’s mobile . phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted . deliberately, as previously suggested, or were removed from her message . box automatically. Tributes: Craig Denholm (left) stands with Bob and Sally Dowler, Milly's parents, who said because her voicemail messages disappeared they believed she was alive - in fact her her phone had been hacked . The . Leveson Inquiry into press standards has heard that Milly’s mother Sally . phoned her daughter repeatedly in March 2002 after she vanished while . walking home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. The . teenager’s voicemail message was a generic automated response when her . message box was full but when a message had been deleted the greeting . reverted to her personal greeting. The . Dowlers told the inquiry they were given ‘false hope’ by hearing the . change of greeting - thinking their daughter might still be alive and . had wiped a message. In fact she had been abducted and murdered by triple-killer Levi Bellfield.

Olympic gold medallist and Tour de France cycling hero Bradley Wiggins announced today that he has ended his involvement with a controversial tax-avoidance scheme. Critics rounded on the 32-year-old after The Mail On Sunday reported last week he was using a scheme named Twofold First Services, owned by a company based in the Cayman Islands. Wiggins stated 'I had a small investment in Twofold, following guidance from my professional advisers'. 'I had, however, claimed no tax relief of any amount in regard to this investment. Given the concerns raised about it, I have now instructed my advisers to withdraw me from the scheme with immediate effect.' A spokesman for Wiggins said at the time: ‘The vast majority of Bradley’s income is taxed at the standard and higher rate. The investment in Twofold Services involves only a small percentage of Bradley’s income. Bradley has paid, and will continue to pay, his fair share of tax.’ In an interview with The Guardian Wiggins went on to describe his frustration at the revelations of Lance Armstrong’s organised doping. He said: 'The anger is more: I’ve got to pick up the pieces. He’s still a multi-millionaire, and he’s not here to answer the questions. I can’t not answer them because I’ve got to go and race next year, and I hate talking about it.' The cyclist, who is hot favourite for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, said there was a price to pay for his success. He said: 'I wouldn’t say I wish I hadn’t won the Tour, but sometimes, especially with recent events, the Lance Armstrong stuff, I find it hard being the winner of the Tour and everything that goes with it.' Controversy: Critics rounded on the 32-year-old after The Mail On Sunday reported last week he was using a scheme named Twofold First Services, owned by a company based in the Cayman Islands . 'I wanted to be the winner for the . challenge of what the sporting event is about and how hard you can train . to do that, and I never wanted all the stuff that went with it.' He also revealed that he finds it difficult to cope with being recognised by fans when he is out with his family. He said: 'They ask your wife to take the photo, which is a bit rude. And after a while that becomes tiresome, especially when you’re having a pizza with your children, or you have to have a photo with somebody else’s kids while yours stand to the side.' 'There comes a point when I’ve got to start getting on with my life. It would be hard to live my life as it is forever.' Famous: Wiggins also revealed that he finds it difficult to cope with being recognised by fans when he is out with his family . In a Twofold-type scheme, an individual . could end up paying no tax at all, by investing around £100,000 yet . claiming tax relief on £1 million. This is achieved as each £100,000 is supplemented by a £900,000 loan taken out by the partnership. That money, after being paid to the farmer, is swiftly repaid to the bank. The accountants find a way to artificially ‘write down’ the investment to become a loss on paper, even though there was no cash loss. The original £100,000 goes to the advisers and banks in fees, but the partnership members claim they have made a loss of £1 million, which they set against their income.","Critics rounded on the 32-year-old after it emerged he was using a scheme named .

The number of people unemployed in France has reached 3million for the first time since 1999, bringing the rate up to 10 per cent the country's leaders say. President Francois Hollande is under even more pressure to tackle France's unemployment levels and his administration has come under attack for not doing enough to fix the economy. Breaking through the 3million mark carries more symbolic importance than economic. France's Ministry of Employment says the 3million threshold was crossed in 1996 and again in 1999. Under pressure: Francois Hollande's (left) administration has come under fire for not doing enough to tackle the economy. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault (right) described the numbers as 'very violent' Employment Minister Michel Sapin confirmed the total on French radio on Sunday and warned that the numbers would likely get worse. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called the numbers 'very violent'. The government announced last week that it had counted more than 2.9 million unemployed people in July, so the threshold was expected to be passed in August. Meanwhile, the largest labour union in Greece warned the country's unemployment could reach 29 per cent in 2013 if the government carries out more planned austerity measures, expected to exceed 11.5 billion Euros - $14.4 billion - for 2012-13. Savvas Rombolis, head of research at the GSEE labour union said: 'The course of the Greek economy is one . of decline. In 2012, we are expecting a drop in gross domestic product . of 7 percent. 'This will create unemployment of 24 percent level - 1.2 . million people,' 'Our estimate is that in 2013, unemployment will be between 28 and 29 percent - more than 1.4 million people. That's because we expect the economy to remain in decline.' The predictions are to be included in a report that will be published Thursday. Unemployment in May reached 23.1 per cent, with the under-25 jobless rate hitting 54.9 percent. Greece is relying on emergency loans from the other 16 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund to avoid bankruptcy. Riots erupted in Athens earlier this year as the full scale of the country's financial crisis emerged . Greeks on minimum wage have seen their spending power reduced to 1979 levels, while those earning an average salary have been pushed back to the equivalent of the early 1980s . The report, Rombolis said, also found that Greeks on minimum wage have seen their spending power reduced to 1979 levels, while those earning an average salary have been pushed back to the equivalent of the early 1980s - after analysing wage trends, the price of goods and services, and the impact of successive tax hikes since Greece's major financial crisis began in late 2009. Greece is relying on emergency loans from the other 16 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund to avoid bankruptcy. It is likely to slash pensions and other benefits further in the new austerity package - which the government says is vital to keep on receiving loan payments and remain a member of the eurozone. European and IMF debt inspectors are due back in Athens at the end of the week, along with European Council President Herman van Rompuy, while Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras is travelling to Germany to meet Tuesday with counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble. In Athens, meanwhile, private doctors working with the country's largest state-run healthcare provider have started charging their patients, in protest at the organization's unpaid bills. A doctors' association said the action against the provider EOPYY started Monday and will last at least five days. Pharmacists launched a similar protest at the weekend, refusing to hand out prescriptions from the state-backed insurer. Police are planning a uniformed demonstration in Athens Thursday to protest likely new pay cuts, while an association representing public prosecutors and other court officials says it will slash operating hours at Greece's backlogged courts if their pay is reduced.","France's Ministry of Employment says the 3million mark was crossed in 1996 and again in 1999 .

Sir Howard Davies said these included controversial extra runways at Heathrow and Gatwick. But this put him on a collision course with the London Mayor, who backs a  so-called ‘Boris Island’ mega-airport in the Thames Estuary. London Mayor Boris Johnson today said he would . not necessarily accept the conclusions of the government's airport . capacity review, which is being carried out by Sir Howard Davies . Mr Johnson warned that going into the . next general election, due by 2015, with the prospect of a third runway . at Heathrow still on the agenda would be ‘toxic and disastrous’ for the . Tories. Sir Howard, chairman of the Airports . Commission, accepted that the Coalition has ruled this out for this . Parliament and that no second runway can be built at Gatwick until after . 2019. But, he declared: ‘Options after that are open. A third runway at Heathrow is on the table.’ Sir Howard will also look at other . radical suggestions. These include creating a four-runway Heathrow to . the west of the existing site and proposals for the estuary airport in . Kent or expansion elsewhere in the country. His six-strong commission will produce . an interim report next year on future aviation policy. This will set . out ‘options’ and some short-term action, including making better use of . existing runways around the capital and regions. But the final report, with more . significant and controversial plans for the longer term, will not appear . until summer 2015, after the last possible date for the next election. Any proposal to expand Heathrow would prove controversial for people living in homes in west London . Sir Howard said he would ‘make best use of time in the long grass’ to give the next government ‘a  flying start’. Mr Johnson, however, wants Sir Howard . to ‘accelerate his timescale’. He derided the Coalition for ‘a policy of . utter inertia’ and described delays to deciding aviation plans as a . ‘fudgerama’. ‘It’s going to be toxic and disastrous . to go into the election of 2015 with Heathrow runway three still on the . agenda, millions of Londoners still in a state of great anxiety and . uncertainty about whether or not they are going to suffer from severe . noise pollution,’ he said. But Sir Howard stressed: ‘The . Coalition is prepared for us to look broadly at all the options on the . table as well as some that are not so a government can come to it after . the election with an open mind.’The aim would be to build ‘political consensus’ which is currently lacking, he added. Other options he will examine include expanding Stansted,  Birmingham or Cardiff airports. Critics have questioned the . impartiality of some members of his commission. They include Sir John . Armitt, former Network Rail and Olympic Delivery chief, who is currently . undertaking policy work for Labour leader Ed Miliband. Sir Howard also pledged to look at potential compensation for homeowners living around Heathrow if he backs a third runway. ‘We need to look at that,’ he said. ‘We could try it out on Nick Clegg who lives in Putney.’ So too does former Transport Secretary . Justine Greening, who also opposes the third runway because of the . noise blight for her constituents. The Prime Minister’s office denied the . issue had been kicked into the long grass. David Cameron’s spokesman . said: ‘People on different sides of the debate have  particular . entrenched views. ‘Often those different options and . different ideas about how we should approach the issue of  airport . capacity are put forward without the evidence.’","London mayor makes new attack on government over 'toxic' air policy .

A Cambridge University rower whose leg was smashed in a car crash has hit out at the reckless driver who has shattered her hopes of rowing for Great Britain. Chiara Ferrara, 27, who competed in the Oxford and Cambridge annual women’s boat race, was left with broken tibia and fibula bones in her leg after a car crashed into the side of her bike as she cycled in Ely, Cambridgeshire, in May. The King's College graduate, from Histon, Cambs, was told by doctors that she would never be able to run again. It forced her to lose her training place with the Start programme, an initiative set up to find stars of future Olympics. It's alumni include Olympic gold-winning pair Helen Glover and Heather Stanning. Chiara Ferrara, 27, pictured, has hit out at the careless driver who shattered her hopes of rowing for Great Britain . The car crash left Ms Ferrara with broken tibia and fibula bones in her leg, pictured in an x-ray . Driver Stephen Bocking, 47, from Ely, Cambs, who hit Ms Ferrara, pleaded guilty to one count of driving without due care and attention. He was given a six-point penalty and made to pay a £300 fine and court costs at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on October 3. The maximum penalty for careless driving is a £2,500 fine, a mandatory three to nine points on the licence and there is the option of a driving ban. Ms Ferrara, who studied Chinese, slammed the soft sentence and warned of the 'soul-destroying' impact even minor accidents can have. The car crash happened in the picturesque cathedral city of Ely, Cambridgeshire, pictured, on May 11 . She said: 'When you have been training 12 times a week as well as working full-time it is soul-destroying when someone takes it all away from you with a moments loss of concentration. 'At the age of 27 I was at that point when I had to decide whether to really go for it with rowing. My goal was to make the national team. 'I never really got my chance and it was not my fault, which is really difficult to deal with. It is heartbreaking. 'Last weekend was the first set of trials. But now I can’t jump, I can’t run I can’t do anything. It would take me a long time to get back to the fitness level I had. 'A consultant told me I might never be able to run again. But I am determined to prove them wrong.' Ms Ferrara, from Histon, Cambridgeshire, rowed for King's College, Cambridge, pictured . Ms Ferrara, who works in alumni relations for Cambridge University, added: 'I do not think it is about punishing for the sake of punishing, but I do not think the sentences for driving offences reflect the impact they have on peoples’ lives. 'His attitude at the scene was so unremorseful. It seemed like a minor inconvenience to his day - but for me it was a life-changing injury. 'He doesn’t have to retake his his driving licence. He can get straight back into his car while I have to live with this for the rest of my life. 'I want to make sure he drives really, really carefully from now on and he tells everyone he meets that they should be really careful behind the wheel too. 'People need to have more appreciation that they are operating what is essentially a speeding lump of metal, which can kill. 'The majority of road users are careful and attentive, but for the few that don’t feel it’s their responsibility to be careful there should be much better education programmes and training. 'The current justice system doesn’t seem to allow for that.'","Chiara Ferrara, 27, has slammed careless driver after car crash left her dream of rowing for Great Britain in tatters .

An undertaker who stole a purse from an elderly woman as he collected her body was jailed yesterday after a judge criticised the sickening ‘breach of trust’. Grahame Lawler, 37, was called to Muriel Swift’s home minutes after it was discovered the 78-year-old disabled spinster had died. He pounced after asking a police officer to hand some paperwork to a colleague outside the room, taking the purse which contained £10 in cash. Jailed: Undertaker Grahame Lawler, seen outside Cambridge Crown Court today, was sentenced to four months in prison for stealing a purse from a woman less than an hour after she died . The police officer noticed the purse was missing after he left. When the married father of three was arrested at a mortuary it was found stuffed up his sleeve. Lawler, who worked for  Co-operative Funeralcare, was jailed for four months at Cambridge Crown Court yesterday after admitting theft from a pending estate. Judge Jonathan Haworth told him: ‘It is difficult to think of a greater breach of trust than stealing from someone who has just died, abusing your position as an undertaker. ‘I can see no alternative but a prison sentence because people will want to see justice in this case. ‘Your good character and early guilty plea do nothing to change this fact. The mitigating factors in this case only lessen the amount of time you will serve.’ Diabetes sufferer Miss Swift, a retired manager of an engineering firm, was confined to a wheelchair after a leg was amputated following a serious fracture of the tibia and fibula. Her body was discovered by her carer on July 6 after she passed away in the living room of her bungalow in Linton, Cambridgeshire. Lawler was employed by Co-operative Funeralcare when he stole the purse, a crime the firm branded 'despicable' A post-mortem examination later revealed she died from pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Sara Walker, prosecuting, said: ‘The attending officer searched the deceased’s handbag in the hope of finding [information about] a next-of-kin. In the handbag was a dark blue leather purse. The purse contained identification and bank notes. ‘Mr Lawler asked the police officer to leave the room to give a form to his work colleague who was in the ambulance. ‘Returning to the room, the officer searched for keys to secure the property, finding herself looking through the handbag once again. This time she noticed the purse was missing.’ When he was arrested at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, Miss Swift’s bank cards and PIN she had noted down on a piece of paper were also found in his wallet. Lawler, of Fulbourn, near Cambridge, was due to appear in court on September 17 but went on the run. He handed himself in two days later. The court heard he got into financial difficulty last year and was £12,000 in debt. Jane Carpenter, 43, a friend of the pensioner who had no living relatives, was at court to hear the sentence. She said afterwards: ‘I knew Muriel a very long time and I thought the world of her, as did my kids. She was the kind of woman who was very giving. She was one of those women who would probably have given him some cash if he had needed it. ‘To steal from someone minutes after they have died is foul. I am pleased to see that he has been sent to prison.’","Grahame Lawler admitted stealing Muriel Swift's purse after being called to the dead woman's home to escort her body to a mortuary .

Boasting spectacular views over the city, the duplex at 88 Central Park is where the star lived for more than half a century and died this July, aged 95. Dan Dunning, whose father was Holm's third husband, told the New York Times: 'She loved it because of the view of the park and the way she felt involvement with the seasons, just by looking through her windows. 'Central Park in the spring was the time she enjoyed most.'

On . the lower floor he reveals that there is a dining room, butler's . pantry, kitchen where the late actress 'loved to cook up batches of . spaghetti and clam sauce'. And an airy living room is lined with windows overlooking the park at treetop height.

A landlord who found bags of meth stuffed inside the walls of his rental home says he couldn’t be more outraged after his horrifying report to police jailed him and his wife for two days. Arriving to shattered glass and a door wide open, Michael Keeley of Lithonia, Georgia found his house ransacked along with the eight bags of meth pulled from hallowed pockets in the walls. Police accused Mr Keeley and his wife of tampering with evidence, were arrested and told their 9-year-old son would be placed in protective services should no one volunteer to take the boy. Outraged: Michael Keeley was accused of tampering with evidence after finding his rented home ransacked with bags of crystal meth stuffed into the wall space . Fortunately for the couple, a neighbor came to the rescue and looked after the child until family came. 'The mirror was here and this wall, I mean that space was taken out and there were drugs behind this wall,' Mr Keeley gestured in the house’s bathroom to WSBTV. But that shock he said was only the beginning. Calling police to report his find, it didn't take long until the tables turned to the officers’ skepticism of his claim. 'OK, come on, guy. Tell the truth. We know no one broke into your house,' he recalled one federal agent pressing him in a bedroom of the house to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'We know no one broke into your house. You did it yourself.' In the kitchen he said his wife got the same treatment while outside their nine-year-old son was left crying in their car. Trashed: Mr Keeley returned to find his home wrecked accused of lying by police . Wrongful: Mr Keeley and his wife were forced to spend two days behind bars after reporting the state of the rental home . 'I will be forever reluctant of picking up the phone to call police again,' Mr Keeley said. As if his frustration couldn’t get worse, it was only weeks ago that Mr Keeley's previous tenants living in the house were arrested for meth charges outside the property. After federal agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security searched the house and gave the Keeleys an all clear to return to it, Sunday morning’s disastrous scene is what they returned to. Cooperating with ICE agents Mr Keeley described touring them around his property, one in particular being an agent he had worked with during his last tenants' arrest and whom he had contacted directly on Sunday. 'I showed them where the back door was open, I showed them where the window was broken out. Then I walked down the hall [to the bathroom] and showed them where the drugs were,' he said. It was after the agent he had previously been in contact with left, putting the scene in the hands of other officers, that he described the atmosphere changing against him. 'Who is this person you called? Who is this person you call?' Mr Keeley described the agents interrogating him after snatching up his cell phone. To the rescue: Mr and Mrs Keeley's 9-year-old son was about to be taken into care before a neighbor offered to look after him before family arrived . Reeling: The couple are free after being bailed for $5,000 each. Mr Keeley said he was still in 'disbelief' after the incident . He said that most of the calls they asked about that morning were to the ICE agent he first reported the scene to. After spending two days in a county jail, on Tuesday the couple both posted a $5,000 bond permitting their release. 'I feel like we were violated because we put our trust in you (the police) to protect us and you betrayed us,' he told WSBTV while returning to his house this week, still seen torn apart. Despite their claims of innocence and wrong doing against them, the couple will still have to go to court to face their charges. Little has pacified the family, however, with the only apology issued to them coming from the ICE officer who was at the scene before their arrest. 'He was apologetic. He said he did not authorize, he did not know, he had no knowledge that they were targeting us for arrest,' Mr Keeley said. 'He thanked me for being a help to them in the past.' The case is being handled and investigated by ICE and not the Clayton County Police Department, according to a police spokesperson. Unassuming: The back door of the house was left open. a window was broken and the house had been vandalized .","Homeowner Michael Keeley and his wife were jailed for two days after reporting bags of methamphetamine stuffed in their rental house's walls to police .

A four-day ceasefire in Syria came to a bloody end yesterday after a car bomb killed ten people in Damascus and government jets bombed the suburbs. President Bashar al-Assad's regime and several rebel groups accepted a truce arranged by Lakhdar Brahimi over the religious holiday of Eid al-Adha. By the close of the pact, each side had blamed the other for repeatedly breaching it. A bloody end: A four-day ceasefire ended yesterday after a car bomb killed 10 people in Damascus . ‘I am deeply disappointed that the . parties failed to respect the call to suspend fighting,’ Ban said in . South Korea, where he was visiting to receive the Seoul Peace Prize. ‘This crisis cannot be solved with more weapons and bloodshed ... the guns must fall silent,’ he said. Brahimi, after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, voiced regret that the ceasefire had not worked better. Asked whether U.N. peacekeepers might be sent to Syria, he said there was no immediate plan for that. Although President Bashar al-Assad’s government and several rebel groups accepted the plan to stop shooting over the Muslim religious holiday, it failed to stem the bloodshed in a 19-month-old conflict that has already cost at least 32,000 lives. Syrian state television said women and children were among those killed by a ‘terrorist car bomb’ near a bakery in Jaramana, in the southeast of Damascus. Damascus residents say the district is controlled by Assad loyalists. 'The guns must fall silent': UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon accepted the truce had failed . Tragic: State television has reported that women and children were among those killed in the car bomb . State media said Assad’s armed opponents had broken the truce throughout the Eid. ‘For the fourth consecutive day, the armed terrorist groups in Deir al-Zor continued violating the declaration on suspending military operations which the armed forces have committed to,’ state news said, later adding that rebels had attacked government forces in Aleppo and the central city of Homs. The Damascus air raids followed what residents said were failed attempts by troops storm eastern parts of the city. ‘Tanks are deployed around Harat al-Shwam (district) but they haven’t been able to go in. They tried a week ago,’ said an activist who lives near the area and who asked not to be named. Victim: An injured girl receives first aid in a hospital after a car bomb exploded in southern Damascus . No ceasefire: A member of the FSA fires a large caliber machine gun at a regime jet as it flew over a rebel checkpoint . Brahimi, who will visit Beijing after Moscow, said the renewed violence in Syria would not discourage him. ‘We think this civil war must end ... and the new Syria has to be built by all its sons,’ he said. ‘The support of Russia and other members of the Security Council is indispensable.’ Russia and China have vetoed three Western-backed U.N. draft resolutions condemning Assad’s government for the violence. Members of the FSA who had left their fighting positions during the Eid al-Adha holiday return to the front line .","The regime and several rebel groups accepted a truce over Eid al-Adha .

Jason Laughlin, a spokesman for the . Camden County prosecutor's office, said 31-year-old Osvaldo Rivera, of . Camden, was arrested Sunday afternoon and charged with murder and . attempted murder. Rivera is currently in jail awaiting arraignment. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Dominick Andujor, right, died in his bed after an intruder broke into his house and slashed his throat, while his 12-year-old sister, Amber, left, was severely injured in the attack . Dominick Andujor, aged six, was stabbed to death early Sunday inside his home in Camden. Authorities said his 12-year-old . sister also was critically wounded, her throat slit, as she slept in . another room. Sunday was the girl's birthday. She is hospitalized at Cooper University Hospital in Camden. The hospital won't discuss her condition, citing privacy concerns. Investigators said the children were . being watched by a 14-year-old girl when the attack happened around 2am . Sunday. She was unharmed. Police say the attacker broke into . the children's house at about 2.30am and stole into an upstairs bedroom, . where he savaged the two children. After she was attacked, Amber Andujor ran through her neighborhood screaming for help - her throat cut open and bleeding profusely. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was fighting for her life in critical condition on her birthday. Her brother Dominick, six, died in the house. Manhunt: Police searched for the attacker all Sunday before finally tracking him down in the evening and arresting him . Arrest scene: Osvaldo Rivera was found hiding between a mattress and a bedroom wall at an apartment in the 3200 block of River Road . The children's mother was at a hospital for surgery on Sunday and was not home at the time of the attack. The victims' 14-year-old sister was . looking after them. She was asleep at the time. A third sister, aged . nine, in the house was also uninjured. Prosecutors said the 12-year-old girl identified her attacker as what sounded like 'Poppy.' Investigators later determined that Rivera lived in the area and went by the nickname 'Popeye,' 6ABC reported. The 31-year-old was taken into . custody at around 4pm on Sunday at an apartment in the 3200 block of . River Road, where he was found hiding between a mattress and a bedroom . wall. 'Several citizens came forward and . showed the courage to provide information, which helped lead to the . initial apprehension,' said Camden County Prosecutor’s Office Lieutenant . Frank Falco. Police also said they seized blood-stained sneakers that matched bloody footprints in the victims . 'home on Ware Street. Charges were filed against Rivera about 2am Monday . morning. Shocking: The attack deeply shook resident of Camden, New Jersey, the murder capital of the nation . According to investigators, during . his questioning Rivera had revealed that he had smoked 'wet,' a . combination of marijuana and PCP, prior to the killing. 'In recent years there have been several other murders in which wet . appeared to have played a part,' prosecutors said in a statement cited by ABC. 'This . drug has a particularly catastrophic effect on people, making them . incoherent, hallucinatory and, in come cases, violent.' In a recent incident, authorities believe Chevonne Thomas was high on 'wet' when she beheaded her two-year-old son Zahree on August 22 in Camden. Thomas had a history of substance abuse and mental health disorders, according to the Department of Children and Families. After the attack early Sunday morning, 12-year-old Amber ran out of the house and began pounding on doors, screaming for help. She banged on several doors until neighbor Nakyta McCray woke up and found her, barely alive. 'I went to the house and saw her sitting there with her throat cut open and barely breathing,' she told ABC Philadelphia. Even gravely injured, Amber was able to identify her attacker, authorities said. Horrific: The 12-year-old ran door to door in her neighborhood screaming for help after she had her throat cut open . Popeye is a well-known figure in the neighborhood, who lives at the end of the block where the attack occurred. Neighbors say he often gives children haircuts and is trusted by parents. 'Everybody . knows him. He’s on this block everyday; playing with the kids, talking . to some of the adults. It’s very shocking,' Ms McCray told CBS Philadelphia. Even in Camden, a beleaguered city with the highest murder rate in the United States, this brutal attack shocked residents. 'I can't sleep. It could have been anybody's child, not just her. My prayers go out to the family. I'm praying for her, I just hope that she makes it,' Karina Mejia told ABC Philadelphia. A makeshift memorial of flowers and teddy bears sprang up on the block where Dominick was murdered. Dominick and his sisters spent much of the summer at the local community center, where he had breakfast and lunch and liked doing arts and crafts. 'He had fun all summer. He liked to play; he liked to have fun; he liked football,'  Cynthia Pulliam, director of the center, told the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'He was so much full of joy.'","Osvaldo Rivera, 31, has been charged with murder and attempted murder .

Surrey County Council alone has spent more than £630,000 of taxpayers’ money since 2010 on 3,650 payouts to motorists for vehicle damage caused by neglected roads and potholes. Britannia Rescue issued Freedom of Information requests to 434 city, district, borough and county councils. Some 143 responded with at least one . piece of data, while 291 are either yet to respond, said that they did . not keep the data, or that they were not responsible for road . maintenance in  their area. Since 2010, more than 54,000 compensation claims have been made to the councils in Britain that supplied figures to the survey. Warning: The combination of a wet summer and a cold winter has particularly harmed road surfaces . The claims ranged from potholes ruining wheel rims to punctured tyres and damaged suspension between 2010-11 and 2011-12. The combination of a wet summer and a cold winter has particularly harmed road surfaces, with potholes forming after water seeps down below the road surface and freezes, loosening the asphalt. According to the data, the average repair bill is £132, with some claims as high as £3,000. At the same time, the average cost of repairing a pothole is around £50, meaning the amount paid out by councils in compensation could have been used to repair more than 96,000 potholes. Road maintenance is severely under-funded with estimates that just £17 per driver is spent on maintaining road surfaces and fixing potholes – amounting to 11 per cent of the annual road tax bill. Peter Horton, managing director of Britannia  Rescue, said: ‘The past two harsh winters caused  significant damage to the UK’s roads, which has not been fully repaired yet. ‘Cuts in road maintenance funding mean that local authorities face very difficult choices on the roads they prioritise for repair. Motorists should protect themselves by keeping an eye out for potholes and keeping speeds down, particularly in wet weather when holes may be filled by rain.’","Surrey County Council has spent more than £630,000 on such claims since 2010 .

Tories and Lib Dems clashed over whether to build a new generation of Trident submarines. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced contracts worth £350million to design the boats now based at the Scottish naval complex of Faslane – an apparent bid to show voters in Scotland what they would be losing if they vote for independence. Scroll down for video . Tories and Lib Dems clashed over whether to build a new generation of Trident submarines. An unarmed Trident II (D5) ballistic missile is pictured launching last week . Nick Clegg, left, denounced Phillip Hammond's announced contracts worth £350million as 'jumping the gun' But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg angrily denounced the move as ‘jumping the gun’, since the main decision to proceed will not have to be taken until 2016. David Cameron made clear last week that he favours retention of the present continuous sea deterrent involving four nuclear-powered submarines. But the Lib Dems have set up a review to find a cheaper alternative, which could see them recommend a reduction in the Trident fleet, a move to short-range missiles on an existing submarine or a move to air-launched nuclear missiles. That is regarded by Tories and senior Royal Navy figures as a cut-price solution that would end Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent and undermine national security. The Tories estimate the cost of replacing Trident at £20billion, but the Lib Dems warn it may cost £50billion. Despite knowing about the announcement since last week, Lib Dems expressed dismay that the Defence Secretary had chosen to depict the awarding of the contracts as a key stage towards renewing Trident. Trident: The Lib Dems have set up a review to find a cheaper alternative, which could see them recommend a reduction in the Trident fleet . HMS Vigilant preparing to fire an unarmed Trident II (D5) ballistic missile, during a test launch in the Atlantic Ocean last week . Mr Clegg said: ‘I think some people are jumping the gun on this. The final decision on Trident replacement will not be taken until 2016, however much other people may not like it that way. ‘The idea of a like-for-like entirely unchanged replacement of Trident is basically saying we will spend billions and billions and billions of pounds on a nuclear missile system designed with the sole strategic purpose of flattening Moscow at the press of  a button.’ The row spread confusion about the policy. A weapons engineering officer pulling the trigger during a rehearsed Trident missile firing onboard a boat as David Cameron made clear he favours retention of the present continuous sea deterrent involving four nuclear-powered submarines . A Downing Street spokesman first said that the Government’s policy was ‘unchanged’ and that ‘we’re still committed to that at-sea nuclear deterrent’. But she later said the Lib Dem review ‘will inform’ the Government’s plans. However sources said Mr Cameron has ‘no intention’ of changing his mind. The row overshadowed attempts by Mr Hammond to make political capital out of his announcement in Scotland, where the SNP government has said it wants to abolish the nuclear deterrent. The Defence Secretary said that the investment would help secure 6,500 jobs on the Clyde but SNP leader Alex Salmond claims only 520 are directly dependent on the nuclear facilities. In a bid to drum up votes in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, Mr Hammond said he intends to move more submarines based in England to Faslane. He added: ‘Right now there are 3,200 civilian jobs on this base, as well as many thousands of military jobs, and that number will increase as we go through the decade.’ But Scottish Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon attacked the UK Government for ‘dumping’ weapons of mass destruction on Scotland and said that an independent parliament would use its share of Trident cash on public services. The Lib Dems have expressed interest in mounting nuclear warheads on cruise missiles fired from Astute class hunter killer submarines. But a senior Navy official told the Mail that each of the alternative policies is implausible if the UK wants to maintain a credible deterrent. Only the UK, the US, Russia and France can deploy submarines anywhere in the world unseen and capable of delivering missiles over a range of more than 7,000 miles. The source said: ‘Astute class submarines are designed for an entirely different purpose. Range would be reduced to hundreds of miles rather than many thousands.

'Jobsworth' binmen have refused to empty 20 wheelie bins on a single street because they were all just 'one inch too full' and therefore too dangerous to deal with. The refuse collectors in Stockport, Greater Manchester, ignored a third of black bins left outside on collection day saying health and safety rules stopped them collecting bins which did not have the lid fully closed. Instead householders on Alldis Street got a sticker on the bins - which carry non recyclable waste including plastic and polystyrene - and nowhere to put their waste for the next fortnight. Anger: Bins like this one in Stockport were left by binmen who refused to empty them because they were an inch 'too full' 'Sorry we are unable to collect any extra waste or recycling that doesn’t fit into your wheelie bin. The lids of the bin must be closed to collect safely,' the sticker said. But one local resident, a young father, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'The binmen left all the bins which had their lids raised - even if it was just half an inch. 'We all got stickers warning us about overflowing bins too - yet they should collect the rubbish every week. 'It’s a nightmare. My bin was already overflowing but it is now overflowing a lot more because the binmen failed to empty it and now the outside of my home looks like a tip. Stuck: Each bin had a sticker explaining how full a bin must be, but the one on the sticker is much fuller than some that were left behind by the refuse collectors . Outrage: Aggrieved residents on Alldis street in Stockport, pictured, have hit out at the council after their wheelie bins were not collected . 'With having a little lad, the bins get full up quite quickly and because they are only collected every two weeks, we just can’t keep on top of it. 'I’ve even asked the collectors if they can take an extra bin bag, as the bin will only fit two bags in. They just told me that they weren’t allowed to do it. 'The bin collectors won’t even empty the bins if the lid is open a tiny bit - it’s stupid. Why should the rubbish be left in my garden if I have put my bins out like I’m supposed to? 'I think it’s outrageous that we have to pay council tax for a service that we are not getting, and it makes me very angry. The bags are just stacking up, and it looks terrible. 'The bins should be collected every week, and we shouldn’t be left with the rubbish that is supposed to have been collected.' Another householder said: 'This must be worth a council tax refund. It’s disgrace that bins should not be emptied because they are too full. These binmen are just being jobsworths.' Bamboozled: Locals residents say they are utterly confused by the number of bins they need to use at home . Officials at coalition run Stockport Council spent £7.3m of taxpayers cash on a new system different coloured wheelie bins - whilst shedding 350 jobs under Government cutbacks. But they bamboozled locals with a system which includes blue bins being earmarked for paper and card, brown bins are now to be used for glass and plastic and green bins for garden waste and food. They also brought in new black bins for non recyclable waste and 'caddies' also for food to replaced the 'old' single black bins which the 136,000 residents of the town used to have outside their homes. The letters under Section 46 of the Clean Neighbourhood and Environment Act 2005 warned locals if they continued to flout the rules they would instantly face a £100 fine, and if they failed to pay up they could be taken to court and fined up to £1,000. Today Stockport Council said: 'Non-collection of overfull bins is in line with Council policy which states that wheeled containers containing waste that does not fit comfortably within the container and the lid is ajar will not be collected. 'A notice will be left on the container explaining why the waste hasn’t been collected. The householder will need to use the Household Waste Recycling Centre/Local Recycling site, or wait until the next collection.'","Council workers blamed health and safety rules for abandoning full bins on a Stockport street .

Almost 2,000 jobs are under threat after the UK’s second biggest hotel chain was snapped up in a £1billon deal masterminded by Goldman Sachs. Fears are mounting for Travelodge’s 6,000-strong workforce as sources suggest up to 150 of the chain’s worst performing hotels could be axed. Goldman led a cabal of finance houses to take control of Travelodge – along with its colossal debt pile. It was previously owned by Dubai International Capital. Travelodge is said to be struggling to make its sites on out-of-town A-roads pay . The chain has touted itself as an island of hope for jobseekers, participating in the Government’s Job Centre Plus Scheme. In one recent round of hiring, it took on a batch of employees who had all been long-term unemployed. It could now be forced to return those very staff to the dole queue. Sources say the burden of any job cuts would fall disproportionately on rural areas. Travelodge is said to be struggling to make its sites on out-of-town A-roads pay. It confirmed yesterday it has plans to offload leases on 49 troubled hotels. Additionally, it has pleaded with landlords at 109 of its hotels to reduce its rent bill. However, top industry sources say the chain is unlikely to find any takers for the 49 sites, in which case the 350 workers at those hotels would almost certainly face the chop. ‘There isn’t another hotel company in the UK that could make them profitable,’ said one expert. Little Chef was similarly squeezed after demand plummeted when its most lucrative sites were bypassed by larger roads. Experts fear that Travelodge’s new owners could be planning to offload even more properties than the 49 announced yesterday. ‘There’s 150 hotels that don’t make any profit,’ said a hotel industry source. If it was forced to shut 150 hotels, up to 1,800 jobs could be at stake. Little Chef was also financially squeezed when its most lucrative sites were bypassed by larger roads . Despite the bad news – contained in a rescue deal known as a Company Voluntary Agreement – there were also promises of new investment. Travelodge said that it, along with its new owners, planned to invest £75million in the business including £55million to refurbish older hotels. Under the terms of the CVA, banks wrote off over £235million of Travelodge’s debts which will bring the firm’s total debts down to £330million. The CVA will be voted on by creditors on September 4 and must command approval of three-quarters of lenders to pass.","Hotel chain could axe 150 sites .

Prince Charles has summoned his youngest son for a heart-to-heart talk this weekend over his naked Las Vegas romp. Royal sources stressed that 27-year-old Prince Harry would not be getting a ‘dressing down’ but Charles was keen to discuss his concerns ‘father to son’. Although they have already spoken over the phone, Harry will be asked to explain in person how he ended up playing a sleazy game of ‘strip billiards’ with a group of strangers in a hotel suite – some of whom then sold photographs of it to a US celebrity website. Scroll down for video . Heart-to-heart: Prince Charles has summoned Harry to ask in person how he . ended up playing a sleazy game of ‘strip billiards’ with a group of . strangers in a hotel suite . Charles and Harry must also decide how to handle the decision of The Sun newspaper to be the only paper to publish pictures of the third in line to the throne naked after St James’s Palace earlier threatened legal action against any UK media who dared use the pictures. Last night aides were still undecided whether to take the newspaper to the Press Complaints Commission – or even serve it with a personal writ – and were waiting to hear the thoughts of Charles and his son on the issue. It is not known where the meeting will take place – Scotland, London or Highgrove, the Prince of Wales’s private Gloucestershire residence. But Charles is currently on holiday at Birkhall, his Highland estate and there is a strong chance Harry may have to make the trip north. Prince William will not be present at the meeting, though the brothers have spoken at length on the phone. The prince is said to be stunned by the scandal. Charles is understood to be ‘frustrated and concerned’ that, once again, Harry is news for all the wrong reasons. A St James’s Palace spokesman said: ‘We are still considering all our options and will not be rushed on this. Prince Harry is, of course, being consulted every step of the way. ‘We have always said that we believe very strongly the photos were taken on an entirely private occasion. We have also said that it is a matter for editors to decide what they should publish.’ Sources close to the case say the palace is, in fact, livid over The Sun’s decision to publish the pictures, despite them having been viewed by millions on the internet. But senior aides feel they have to weigh up what they have to lose or gain by a public fight with the country’s biggest selling daily newspaper. They are also understood to be extremely fearful that more photographs or accounts of the prince’s seedy exploits in Las Vegas will emerge. This lack of decisiveness is hugely at odds with their aggressive attempts to stop the pictures being published in the first place. Scandal: Prince Harry mingles with the ladies on his Las Vegas holiday when he was pictured cavorting naked with women in a hotel . On Wednesday Prince Charles’s solicitors, Harbottle and Lewis, wrote to the PCC asking them to make Fleet Street ‘fully aware’ it believed there was no public interest in newspapers running the photographs and that to do so would be a ‘clear breach’ of media regulations. Yesterday Louise Mensch, a Tory MP on . the Media Committee, backed The Sun’s decision to publish, claiming . there was a ‘clear and demonstrable’ public interest. Threat: Despite the Palace and Prince Harry's lawyers saying that papers would breach PCC rules if they printed the naked photos, they are yet to complain about The Sun's front page . She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘The PCC after the Leveson Inquiry really ought not to be in the business of collectively telling newspaper editors they can’t run a story and they shouldn’t use their best judgment.’ Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of media mogul Rupert, the Sun’s owner, yesterday insisted newspapers should be able to publish material available widely online. She said: ‘I feel bad for him, [but] we’ve all seen the pictures online. If newspapers can’t participate, I think it asks questions about where print and online [meet].’ But Commons culture, media and sport select committee chairman John Whittingdale said of The Sun’s decision: ‘The fact that [the photos] happened is well known. How the public interest is served by doing this is not clear.’ The PCC has received more than 850 complaints from the public about The Sun’s decision to use the images. But it says that, because it is an issue of privacy, it is crucial to have a complaint from the prince himself in order to take action. Jonathan Collett, of the PCC, said that if a formal complaint was made after publication, then the PCC would look at the case in detail, including case law. Last night the storm grew over the role of Harry’s police protection officers in the incident grew after Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe appeared to have a change of heart. He initially dismissed the pictures as not an issue for the Yard. But as it faced growing questions over the actions of two royal bodyguards who watched Harry being photographed, it emerged the Commissioner has now taken a keen personal interest in the case. Harry's rumoured new girlfriend Cressida Bonas . Posing in a bright pink wig, this is Prince Harry’s rumoured new girlfriend enjoying herself on holiday days before the naked photos scandal broke. Cressida Bonas, 23, the daughter of a sixties It-Girl, was last month revealed by the Daily Mail as the latest blonde beauty to be romanced by the royal after they were pictured on a night out together. Two weeks ago she flew out first class with the prince to Necker, Sir Richard Branson’s private paradise in the British Virgin Islands, to celebrate his son Sam’s 27th birthday. Willowy former Leeds drama student Cressida bears a close resemblance to several of Harry’s former girlfriends, including long-term love Chelsy Davy and summer fling Florence Brudenell-Bruce. Pictures from the Necker trip show her with the word ‘Sam’ and a heart written in body paint on her arm to mark the occasion. In one photo she can be seen cuddling one of her best friends, Charlotte Kennington Courtauld. In another she appears to be posing on the bow of a luxury cruiser with a group of similarly dressed pals. Intriguingly, however, she does not appear to have gone on with Harry to Las Vegas – which may account for the extent of the prince’s unfettered behaviour. Miss Bonas was keeping a low profile yesterday as was her mother, four-times married and divorced Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, a banking heiress and model who has five children with three of her husbands.","Have already spoken over the phone but Charles is keen to talk in person .

Hezbollah: Leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah has said the Ayub drone was manufactured in Iran and assembled in Lebanon . Iran yesterday claimed to have images . of sensitive Israeli military bases taken by a drone that was launched . by Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement earlier this month. The announcement by senior Iranian MP Ismaeil Kowsari gave no details about the photos - other than calling the Israeli bases “forbidden sites” - but it suggested Iranian drones have the ability to transmit data while in flight. It also appeared aimed at warning Israel about the options for retaliation for any possible strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Kowsari, also was quoted as saying that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah possesses more sophisticated Iranian-made drones than the one that took the pictures and was shot down by the Israeli military, including some that could carry weapons. 'These drones transmit the pictures online,' Kowsari told the semi-official Mehr news agency. 'The pictures of forbidden sites taken and transmitted by this drone are now in our possession.' The MP, who heads the parliament’s defence committee, said Hezbollah is “definitely” equipped with more sophisticated drones, but gave no further details. A senior Israeli military official in Israel’s northern command said he did not believe the drone possessed a camera, though he noted an Israeli investigation is continuing. He spoke on condition of anonymity under military guidelines. Hezbollah 'won’t announce it as long as it doesn’t see the need to do so ... That’s why we say we will respond to Israel inside (its) territory, should it take any action against us,' said Kowsari, a former commander of the powerful Revolutionary Guard. Iran has claimed that Iranian-made surveillance drones have made dozens of apparently undetected flights into Israeli airspace from Lebanon in recent years. Israel has rejected the account. Iran’s Defence Minister Ahmad Vahid also claimed on Sunday that Tehran has drones far more advanced than the Ayub unmanned aircraft launched by Hezbollah, saying it was not the 'latest Iranian technology, definitely.' He did not elaborate. Long range: The Shahed 129 drone nearly doubles the range of previous drones produced by Iranian technicians . Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah has said the Ayub drone was manufactured in Iran and assembled in Lebanon. Iran routinely announces technological breakthroughs in its defence programme. Last month it claimed to have started producing a long-range missile-carrying drone with a range of 1,250 miles. The Shahed-129, or Witness-129, covers much of the Middle East including Israel and nearly doubles the range of previous drones produced by Iranian technicians, who have often relied on reverse engineering military hardware with the country under Western embargo. But it is unclear whether the new drone contains any elements of an unmanned CIA aircraft that went down in eastern Iran last year. Iran said it has recovered data from the RQ-170 Sentinel and claimed it was building its own replica. Iran’s claims are impossible to independently confirm because the country’s arsenal is not open to widespread international inspection with multinational war games or other co-operation.","Iran claims Iranian-made .

French prosecutors have launched a murder inquiry into the 2004 death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Arafat died in a French military hospital in 2004 from what doctors said at the time was a stroke. But new evidence and pressure from his widow and a TV investigation have prompted authorities to examine the possibility he was actually poisoned. There have long been rumours in the Arab world that Arafat was poisoned, and a Swiss lab's recent finding of elevated levels of a rare and highly lethal radioactive substance on Arafat's clothing has fed those claims. However, the Institute of Radiation Physics said its findings were inconclusive and that only exhuming Arafat's remains could bring possible clarity. Palestinian officials have waffled on the matter - initially approving the exhumation and then saying the matter needed more study - only further fueling suspicions. Still, since Arafat's death, several senior Palestinian officials have alleged that Israel poisoned the Palestinian leader, a charge Israel vehemently denied. Testing Arafat's bones for . polonium-210 - the substance found on his clothes - could offer the last . chance to get to the bottom of Palestinian claims that their leader was . poisoned, though some experts say it may already be too late for . conclusive answers. Cause of death: Doctors at the Val de Grace hospital in Paris said he died from a stroke . Investigation: Arafat's widow Suha Arafat, pictured here alongside then Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nabil Shaath (left) and then French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin, has reportedly filed a legal complaint into her husband's death . Many have speculated that Arafat, whose West Bank grave is pictured here, was killed by an Israeli spy agency . Scientists caution that polonium decays quickly and that an autopsy needs to be done right away. The findings were first . broadcast by Arab satellite TV station Al-Jazeera, which approached the . lab on behalf of Arafat's widow, Suha. She provided the lab with his clothing and other belongings. When the results were released, Suha Arafat filed a complaint in French court asking for a murder investigation. The . two judicial officials - who would only speak on condition of anonymity . because of office rules - said a judge will be appointed to run the . investigation shortly. The complaint is open and does not name a responsible party, as is a common practice in French courts. Slow death: Russian security agent Alexander Litvinenko before his death in November 2006 . Rumours suggesting Arafat was poisoned by Israeli intelligence agents have swirled around the middle east for years - fuelled by a recent investigation into a urine stain found on his underwear. Tests found the urine had traces of Polonium-210, the highly radioactive substance that killed Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko (pictured) in 2006. Other theories have speculated that Arafat actually died after contracting cancer, cirrhosis, or even HIV. Those exposed to a lethal dose of Polonium, usually by ingesting it, die within 2-3 months. In most cases there are no serious symptoms for a week after being exposed, but nausea and fatigue would set in soon after. In . theory, just a microgram of Polonium - the same as a spec of dust - is . enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which . affect the body's organs. After ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. Serious . illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it . takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures. As . the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose . hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed. This later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance. Though . it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium . poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko who fell ill the . day after he was exposed. The Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage.",Probe will examine claims Palestinian leader was poisoned .

But a court has told Fisher he can now undergo the therapy one-to-one with a probation officer after he underwent gender realignment therapy and changed his name to Saralee. Before & after: Flasher Stuart Fisher, left, before he underwent gender reallignment to become Saralee, right . Fisher was arrested for committing a string of offences in Whitley Bay between March and November 2009, while still living as a man. He was convicted in January 2010 and given a community order with supervision requirements as well as being ordered to undergo group therapy sessions. It's unknown if he was placed on the sex offenders register as part of his punishment. Since his conviction he made the decision to undergo a sex change - forcing North Tyneside Magistrates Court to reassess his punishment during a hearing last month. It's thought to be the first time ever officials have been forced to alter the conditions of a sex offender's punishment in this way. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'The suitability of treatment programmes for offenders is assessed on a case by case basis and the decision to vary a community sentence requirement is a matter for the courts. 'If an offender is not deemed suitable for group courses their offending  behaviour will still be addressed on a one to one basis with specialist help if required.' Reprieve?'Saralee's punishment was changed during a hearing at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court last month . A source close to the case insisted Fisher had not been given a reprieve and that his punishment would just be 'carried out in a different way'. They added: 'Obviously this is a very unusual case and authorities in the North have never had to deal with a situation like this before. 'The groupwork programme specifically for men so it wasn't suitable for a woman to be on the course. 'As the offender became a woman part way through the course something had to be done. 'There was never a chance that the punishment would be removed - it will just be carried out in a different way.' But campaigners insist he should be forced to carry out the punishment he was given. Claire Phillipson, director of Wearside Women in Need, said: 'We have been waiting for this kind of thing to start, and it all stems from the Equality Act 2010 which is a real hot potato at the moment. 'What difference does change in gender make? 'It is irrelevant whether this person has changed gender or is undergoing gender reassignment - they have committed an offence for which they were sentenced by the court. 'A change of name or body does not make them any less dangerous or mean that they should not carry a sentence that the court ordered.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Stuart Fisher, 47, was convicted of a string of public decency offences .

A drunk driver has been jailed after shattering a gold medal-winning Paralympian's 2012 dream when he ran him over in a hit-and-run accident. Champion cyclist Simon Richardson MBE was on an early-morning training session for the London games near his home in Bridgend, south Wales, when he was knocked over by Edward Adams, who was more than twice the drink-drive limit. Alcoholic Adams, who had been driving at about 40mph, then drove his van away from the scene, leaving his seriously injured victim in the road. Jailed: Edward Adams, left, knocked over Paralympian Simon Richardson, right, in a hit-and-run accident . Accident scene: The Paralympian was training for the London Games on the A48 on a road known locally as Crack Hill (pictured) The 61-year-old farmer  rushed back home to hide his vehicle before pouring himself a glass of whisky - in a bid to try to disguise the fact he had been drinking before the collision, Cardiff Crown Court was told. Mr Richardson was left with a . catalogue of injuries included a fractured spine, broken pelvis, . collapsed lung and perforated bowel, forcing him to abandon his London 2012 dream. Judge Daniel Williams said Adams had shown limited empathy for his victim - and none of the courage and dignity displayed by Mr Richardson. He said: 'You first got into the car at 8.45am that morning and when you were breathalysed just after midday you were more than twice the legal drink drive limit. 'Mr Richardson was clearly visible - cycling close to the kerb and wearing bright clothing. 'Your claims that you were affected by sneezing and sunlight were wholly untrue. 'Your reaction to the accident and its aftermath could not be in greater contrast with the man that you had left injured. 'You took the opportunity to leave the scene - knowing you had caused the accident.' Champion cyclist: Simon Richardson (pictured) was made an MBE after winning two golds and one silver medal at Beijing in 2008 . Mr Richardson, 44, who won two gold medals and a silver in 2008, was training for the London Games on the A48 on a road known locally as Crack Hill in August last year. Cardiff Crown Court heard he was thrown 26 metres into the air after Adams’ van hit him from behind. He stopped briefly, but drove off after he noticed another motorist had stopped to offer him assistance. Adams then attempted to hide his Peugeot van at his farm. It was eventually located by a police helicopter, and was found with damage to a wing and windscreen. Adams, when interviewed by police, said he had been drinking the night before and had drunk his first whisky at 6am when he woke up. Brave: Mr Richardson was left with a catalogue of injuries which forced him to abandon his 2012 dream . The court heard even with his driving . glasses on Adams could not read a number plate from four metres away - . and could only partially read one from two metres. He admitted drink-driving and failing to stop, but denied a charge of dangerous driving. Judge Williams described Adams’ version of events during his trial as 'instinctive lies' - and said the sentence he imposed reflected the serious harm and injury Mr Richardson had been caused. Adams was given a 15 month prison sentence for dangerous driving, and an extra three months jail for failing to stop. A three month sentence for driving with excess alcohol will run concurrently. Adams will also be disqualified from driving for five years. Following the court’s verdict, Mr Richardson said he faced an uncertain future. The father-of-two said: 'I still have another operation to go through, which if it is unsuccessful could leave me permanently paralysed. 'It’s also been difficult to miss out on taking part in the London Paralympics. 'But I am a strong person, and plan to keep on fighting. As for the court’s verdict, I am happy in a way with the sentence. 'I would have been happy whatever sentence he got - even if he walked free. 'At the end of the day, it was just an accident and he did not deliberately set out to knock me down. 'But it is important that a precedent has been set - that not only should a person be charged with excess alcohol but it also qualifies as dangerous driving. 'I hope this incident shows the need for drivers to be more aware of cyclists on the road.' Mr Richardson, of Porthcawl, was made an MBE after winning two golds and one silver medal at Beijing in 2008. He suffered life-threatening injuries and his family were at his bedside for two weeks at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Mr Richardson revealed that he was unconscious for 15 days, waking up in hospital and not recognising his family or friends. Torchbearer: Mr Richardson lighting the Paralympic cauldron outside City Hall in Cardiff . He said: 'For 25 days my life was in the balance - it was touch and go whether I survived. 'Every night when my wife left hospital she was told that I could be dead by the following morning.' Simon revealed he has already set his sights on the Paralympic Games in Rio in four year’s time. He said: 'I’ve recovered before and I know I can do it again. 'There’s a possibility I could be paralysed from the waist down but I would love to go to Rio. 'Watching the Paralympics will be a mixed feeling - I want to be there, I should be there. 'I will be watching on TV but I haven’t got tickets.' Mr Richardson was involved in a car accident in 2001 which left him with serious leg and back injuries and no feeling down his left hand side. Prior to his accident Mr Richardson was a keen cyclist, but he stopped cycling until 2005 when his doctors advised him to start training again to help his rehabilitation. His cycle is powered only by his right leg, riding an adapted bike.","Champion cyclist Simon Richardson MBE was training for London 2012 when he was knocked over .

This was Kristallnacht 1938, when Nazi stormtroopers unleashed their hatred on Jewish businesses, synagogues, shops and homes — and the fire brigade stood idly by. Up to 30,000 people across Germany were arrested, beaten, murdered or sent to concentration camps. Sir Ludwig Guttmann, the founding father of the modern day Paralympics, escaped Nazi Germany and transformed perceptions of disabilities in sport . Hero: Dr Ludwig Guttmann (right), the founder of the Paralympics, greets the Queen at the opening of a news sports stadium disabled athletes on a site adjoining Stoke Mandeville Hospital, near Aylesbury, in 1969 . But, in the town of Breslau, there was a hero of the hour: doctor Ludwig Guttmann. As traumatised Jews turned up at his hospital, he instructed staff to admit them, even if their injuries were too minor for an overnight stay. When the Gestapo arrived to round them up, he persuaded the officers that they were all too sick to leave. He saved 60 people from certain death in concentration camps. Six athletes will ‘fly’ into tonight’s spectacular Paralympics opening ceremony in golden wheelchairs, it was revealed last night. The dramatic scenes will be at the heart of the showpiece opening, which is expected to be watched on TV by a record billion people around the world, as well as 80,000 in the stadium. Among those flying into the stadium in wheelchairs will be Britain’s greatest ever paralympian, 11-time champion Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, 43. The ceremony, which is entitled Enlightenment, begins at 8.30pm and will kick-start 11 days of sport in front of unprecedented crowds – the event is on course to be the first sell-out Paralympic Games in history. Great Britain is hoping for a record haul of medals surpassing the 102 won in Beijing in 2008 as athletes are inspired by their home crowds, as happened during the Olympics. Last night transport chiefs warned the Paralympics would pose a ‘huge challenge’ for London’s transport network, saying they feared the many Londoners who worked from home during the Olympics would not be doing the same during the games. But London Mayor Boris Johnson promised that the Paralympics would be a ‘wonderful show’ and would change the preconception of disabilities for good. As thousands rushed to buy the remaining tickets, the mayor said the opening ceremony would be ‘superb’ and that the public would be ‘blown away’ by the level of sportsmanship on display. Tonight’s event will open with the words ‘O wonder! How many goodly creatures there are here’ from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, with a young actress playing the character of Miranda leading the audience through the ceremony. Ludwig Guttmann is also the . inspirational neurosurgeon who founded the Paralympic Games and changed . the course of thousands of lives. Before 1948, when Britain last hosted the Olympics, patients with severed spinal cords were rarely rehabilitated, let alone to the extent that could compete in sports. With no active life to look forward to and poor care, they contracted infections, gave up hope, and were usually dead within weeks or months. But World War II meant hospitals were flooded with servicemen who had suffered this type of injury. Enter . Dr Guttmann, a Jewish German refugee who had fled to England in 1939 . and was working at the specialist Stoke Mandeville Hospital in . Aylesbury, Bucks. Guttmann . was a passionate believer in the power of sport to inspire and motivate — . and he  introduced an athletic competition in the grounds of the . hospital to coincide with the Olympics at London’s Wembley. His . first event was wheelchair archery. Though only 16 competitors took . part, including two women, the notion of paraplegics becoming athletes . was ground-breaking. His . games gave birth to the Paralympics, and he was nicknamed Poppa by one . and all — commemorating his role as the father of the Games . Sixty-four . years later, his dream has been well and truly realised. Tomorrow, . 4,200 athletes from 165 nations will begin competing with the world . watching them. But Guttmann’s early life gave no hint . to the visionary he would become. He was born in the coal-mining . district of Upper Silesia (now Poland) in 1899 to an orthodox Jewish . family, and took a volunteer job at a local hospital for mining injuries . when he was 18. He was . particularly touched by the plight of one young miner he tended. This . man had a fine physique but had broken his back in a mining accident. He . was paralysed from the waist down and the doctors held out no hope. The . accepted method of treatment in those days was to encase patients in . plaster and isolate them. They . would die within weeks. This is what happened to that young man, who . got a urinary infection and blood poisoning, and died within five weeks. Guttmann said later: ‘Although I saw . many more victims suffering the same fate, it was the picture of that . young man which remained indelibly fixed in my memory.’ The archery competition at Stoke Mandeville was the precursor to the modern Paralympics, giving war veterans with terrible injuries strength and confidence . Bringing hope: Dr Guttmann was a passionate believer in the power of sport to inspire and motivate so he introduced an athletic competition in the grounds of the hospital to coincide with the London Olympics in 1948 . The . following year, Guttmann started medical studies at the University of . Breslau. He continued at Freiburg, and developed an interest in physical . training and sport. He . was already a member of a Jewish fraternity determined to use sport to . impart confidence and self-esteem to members feeling the scourge of . anti-Semitism. After failing . to find a job in paediatrics, he returned to Breslau and enrolled in . the neurology and neurosurgery department. By the time Adolf Hitler had . risen to power in 1933, Guttmann was director of Breslau’s Jewish . hospital. His growing reputation led to many offers to work abroad. He turned them all down — until Kristallnacht. In 1984 Prince Charles opened the Paralympics, complete with sombrero . Pioneer: The first event to take place was wheelchair archery. Though only 16 competitors took part, including two women, the notion of paraplegics becoming athletes was ground-breaking . By then, Guttmann was married with two children, Dennis and Eva, and he knew he’d have to leave Germany for their safety. He . got £250 (£10,000 today) from the Council for Assisting Refugee . Academics — a charity led by the Master of Oxford’s Balliol College — . and started work in the city’s Radcliffe Infirmary. Dr Guttmann was a popular figure, but there were many who thought his ideas fanciful. He tirelessly argued, though, that with proper treatment paraplegics could live full and rewarding lives . Guttmann made such an impression that the government asked him in September 1943 to open a centre for spinal injuries, anticipating a rise in patients after the planned D-Day landings against Germany. He agreed on the condition he could implement his own treatment theories, and picked Stoke Mandeville for his base, taking up his post on February 1, 1944. His unit was called Ward X and had 26 beds and one patient. Guttmann was a popular figure — but there were many who thought his ideas fanciful. He tirelessly argued, though, that with proper treatment paraplegics could live full and rewarding lives. Sport was a critical part of the therapeutic programme he designed for his patients. Guttmann’s daughter Eva Loeffler, who at 79 is a torchbearer and this year’s Mayor of the Paralympic village, recently said: ‘My father’s big thing was that he was determined to make his patients taxpayers. ‘One of them told me he was lying in a . corner of the ward feeling sorry for himself and my father came along . and asked, “What are you doing?” He said he was waiting to die. So my . father said that, whilst you’re waiting for the Good Lord to take you, . go to the workshop and do some carpentry, do some work, start a career. ‘So . he did. And this chap told me that after leaving hospital, he actually . became the head of a building firm and did very well.’ Guttmann . ended up inspiring thousands — and changing the way the nation thinks . about paraplegics. Last month, a statue to him was unveiled at Stoke . Mandeville. But his real . legacy will be the performances during the next two weeks. As his son .

Bank of America Merrill Lynch is poised to send trucks filled with cash into Greece as part of plans being adopted by U.S. firms in the event of the country crashing out of the euro. With Greece teetering on the brink of a chaotic exit from the Eurozone, American banks and consulting firms have drawn up contingency plans for the financial turbulence that would follow. Merrill Lynch is one of the firms preparing to bring in large amounts of the drachma, Greece's former currency which is expected to be used if they leave the Euro, in order to pay employees in case the banks shut during the transition and access to cash is hard to come by. Ongoing issue: The financial crisis in Greece has often turned into protests, like the one these police are preparing for here in 2010, but now it is more of a concern of how to facilitate a transition out of the Euro . Going back: Long considered the last resort, financial analysts feel the country will revert back to its former currency called the Drachma, and now it is only a matter of when the switch will happen . Following fifteen months of increasingly . dramatic negotiations, the debt crisis has reached the point where . financial analysts aren't talking about if but when it will happen. The New York Times spoke to experts who expect that such a grave decision would be announced after the close of business on a Friday after markets are finished for the weekend. Then, if the country were to revert from the Euro, the currency which it has used since 2001, then it will require an extra bank holiday on Monday to organize and distribute the new currency. Reuters asserts that without further aid, Greece will be staring at certain bankruptcy and a return to the drachma. Ford, the American car company, has already programmed their computers within the country so that they are able to handle transactions in terms of drachma instead of euros, showing how imminent they expect the change to be. In such a situation, it would be nearly impossible for banks to rapidly hand out cash to consumers, leading the way for more confusion. 'Companies are asking some very granular questions, like ""If a news release comes out on a Friday night announcing that Greece has pulled out of the euro, what do we do?"" 'In some cases, companies have contingency plans in place, such as having someone take a train to Athens with 50,000 euros to pay employees,' Peter Frank of PricewaterhouseCoopers told The Times. Old is new again: The country is expected to switch from the Euro (right) which they have used since 2001 to their former currency called Drachma (left) Contingency plans: Banks are discussing driving trucks full of cash into Greece to help facilitate the transition if it were to happen, though the exact model of car is unknown. Protestors shown here in 2008 attacked this bank transfer armored truck . The fact that such drastic action is on the brink of becoming the solution was not expected by many inside Greece, though foreign advisers have been continually critical of the common Euro currency for the entirety of the crisis. 'When we started giving advice, they came for the free sandwiches and chocolate cookies,' Bank of America Merrill Lynch head of Europe Carole Berndt said jokingly the paper. 'Now that has changed, and contingency planning is focused on three primary scenarios — a single-country exit, a multi-country exit and a breakup of the euro zone in its entirety.' If Greece were to leave the Eurozone, Spain and Italy would be the next focus of the financial world as their own debt troubles could be alleviated to a degree by also reverting to their own currencies. Merrill Lynch is not alone in preparing for further tremors within the European economic community. Visa and Mastercard both said that they have back-up plans and protocols in place so that they will be prepared if other countries also decide to leave the common currency. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said 'Bank of America Merrill Lynch has no current plan . to send cash to Greece beyond our normal course of business. We are working . closely as a priority with our many clients to ensure that they are fully . prepared for all possible outcomes regarding the current issues affecting the . eurozone.'","Greece is on brink of financial collapse and is expected to leave Euro .

A jilted husband built a confinement room at an abandoned farmhouse to imprison the woman who supported his ex-wife. Robert Edwin White insisted he never intended to hurt or kill anyone and that no one other than himself had been in the dungeon he built in the basement of a farmhouse in Pickering, Southern Ontario, Canada, when arrested earlier this year according to facts read out in court on Wednesday. Investigations revealed the insulated dungeon - lockable only from the outside - was intended for a woman White planned to kidnap after she assisted his ex-wife emotionally and financially after the couple’s separation. Dungeon: Chains hung from the roof of this confinement room which Robert Edwin White built with plans to allegedly kidnap and contain the woman who supported his ex-wife . The room, in an empty farmhouse on Pickering airport lands slated for demolition, was discovered by a worker last November. It was heavily reinforced with double-paned windows and a three-inch door made of multiple sheets of plywood, prosecutor Dave Slessor told Ontario Court Justice Mary Teresa Devlin. Chains hung from the ceiling, there was a bench in the newly-painted room and the door was bolted from the outside with tyre irons, the court heard. Mr Slessor said: ‘It can’t be opened from the inside once it’s bolted from the outside.’ The farmhouse was then destroyed by a deliberately-lit fire but no evidence linked White to the fire according to police. Abandoned building: The room was built in the basement of this empty farmhouse on airport lands slated for demolition in Pickering, Ontario, Canada . Court documents obtained by CBS News told how White’s wife of ten months left him the day police arrived at their home in Oshawa, Ontario with a search warrant. She filed for divorce soon after on January 30. His wife said in her application that she had begun experiencing ‘emotional and verbal abuse’ last summer. The document also revealed that she had moved into a shelter for fear White might harm her or her daughter. The 44-year-old was arrested on February 13 and charged with attempted kidnapping and break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence but the kidnapping charge was dropped when he pleaded guilty to the break and enter charge. Ablaze: After the discovery of the room, the farmhouse was destroyed by a deliberately-lit fire but no evidence linked White to the fire according to police . Security staff patrolling the area had recorded the number plate of White’s Mercedes-Benz after it was seen parked near the farmhouse on a few occasions. Paul Affleck, defending, said White agreed with the facts read into the record but insisted he did not intend to demand a ransom for his kidnapping target. White remains in custody awaiting a sentencing hearing. Confinement rooms have been used in various crimes around the world. Connell C. Williams from Oklahoma allegedly starved to death his girlfriend’s 10-year-old son and locking him in a room for months as punishment for eating too many sweets in May last year. Kidnappers in Poland snatched a 19-year-old student and locked him in a tiny DIY cell for nearly two weeks. They threatened to kill the boy if his wealthy father did not pay a £200,000 ransom but he was rescued by police who raided the dingy bunker in May.","Robert Edwin White pleaded guilty of breaking and entering an abandoned farmhouse slated for demolition .

Bumper-to-bumper: There were so many Ferraris taking part that there was only 250m of road free on the 3.6 mile track . F1 ace Felipe Massa led the pack from behind the wheel of a black Ferrari 458 Spider . He said: 'I've never seen so many Ferraris in one place and I've been a member of the Ferrari Owner's Club for 14 years. 'It's incredible, a lot of people appreciate Ferraris and this has made a lot of people's day. I took part in the 2007 record and then the Japanese beat it. 'Hopefully today has made it impossible for them to beat. It has been exceptional.' The record- breaking convoy took Ferrari and the Ferrari Owners Club of Great Britain more than nine months to organise. Peter Everingham, secretary of the Ferrari Owners Club for the past 20 years, was at the front of the pack. He said: 'It was a unique experience to be in the course car ahead of more than 900 other Ferraris. 'It is something that might never happen again and I am so proud to have been involved in the event. 'The enthusiasm from everyone was palpable, the whole feeling was extraordinary.' In 2007, Ferrari managed to get 385 models onto Silverstone at a racing day to set a record. But this was beaten the following year when the Ferrari Owners Club in Japan achieved 490 cars at the Fuji Speedway Circuit. For every car which took part, Ferrari donated £5 to 'BEN', the automotive industry charity.","Convoy surpasses Japan's record of 490 set in 2008 .

A Second World War veteran has been reunited with the Spitfire he flew on his final mission nearly seventy years ago. Lieutenant Rolf Kolling, now 91, returned to North Weald Airfield in Essex last Friday to catch another glimpse of the Mark IX Spitfire. He was joined by wingman and compatriot Eigel Stigset at the home of 332 Squadron, where celebrations were taking place this weekend to mark the 70th anniversary of the wartime links between North Weald and Norway. Flying high: Veteran Rolf Kolling was reunited with the spitfire he flew in the Second World War . The pair are the two surviving veterans of the last combat mission flown by the RAF's Norwegian wing in the Second World War. As they and five other veterans, their families, and senior serving Norwegian officers arrived at the airfield, near Epping, they were warmly greeted by an honour guard of veterans bearing RAF Association standards and local schoolchildren waving Norwegian flags. Returning to the base, where Norwegian pilots arrived from 1942, brought back bittersweet memories for Kolling, who in his combat career of 120 . sorties was credited with one confirmed kill and a . share in one probable. The son of a railway engineer, Kolling joined . Norway’s merchant marine at the age of 18, just before the outbreak of war in September 1939. In 1941, a year after Norway fell to the Nazis, he jumped ship in Melbourne, Australia, and headed to Canada, where Norwegians were being trained as pilots. Before long, Kolling was serving with the RAF's 332 Squadron and flew alongside Stigset in Spitfire ML407. Reunited: The 91-year-old veteran sits on the wing of Spitfire ML407 . Their last mission came on April 21, 1945, during which the pair took out a large German armoured patrol vehicle while flying at just 500ft and about 400 miles per hour. They returned to Schijndel, their temporary Dutch base, and the next day were taken out of the front line. By the next month, they had returned to liberated Norway. In total, the two Norwegian squadrons based at North Weald shot down 180 enemy aircraft while losing 72 pilots. In an interview with The Telegraph, Kolling said: 'Four Spitfires would go up. And none would come back. Two pilots would be dead. Two . would be prisoners of war. Every time you got into the cockpit, you knew it could be your last flight.' He added: 'Even now I think about those times. Every night. Before I left home, I told myself that this would be the last time I . came back to North Weald. I am very, very glad I came here.' A slab of rock from the mountains of Norway will be installed at the airfield to commemorate their bravery. After the war, the grandfather, who now lives in Lysaker, near Oslo, served as a commercial pilot. Meanwhile Spitfire ML407 was converted into a two-seater by the Irish Air Corps and was used as a training aircraft until 1960. It was bought by Nick Grace, a design engineer and amateur pilot in 1979, who restored it to flying condition before his death in 1988. His son, Richard, 28, flew ML407 from its base in Suffolk to North Weald for the poignant reunion. Later on, the veterans looked on with nostalgia, as the plane performed two low level passes on the runway before finishing with a victory roll. Major General Finn Hannestad, the head of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, said: 'It is an absolute privilege to be able . to bring him and veterans like him back to North Weald, to where they . started everything, to our roots as an air force.'

Grim-faced: John Terry stares at Ferdinand as the QPR player passes the Chelsea captain at Loftus Road . The QPR defender rejected the offer of his two rivals' outstretched hands before the game at Loftus Road. No other QPR player appeared to ignore Terry or Cole, who testified as a . character witness for his England team-mate at the trial. Terry, who remains the subject of a . Football Association investigation over the charges that he denies, had . been a doubt for the Loftus Road clash but recovered from an ankle injury sustained on England duty. QPR fans then started singing derogatory chants at the Chelsea captain and Cole, who were jeered every time they touched the ball during the London derby. Ignored: Ferdinand snubbed Ashley Cole, who appeared as a character witness for Terry . The handshakes had been abandoned in advance of the previous two encounters between the clubs. QPR manager Mark Hughes branded the handshake row 'ridiculous' on Friday and called for the ritual to be axed. 'Is this the best way to do it? I think it’s open to debate,' he said. 'Maybe something could be done after the match. 'The lead-up to the game has been ridiculous and everyone has been focusing on this one moment just prior to the game.

A court heard the 31-year-old allegedly called  Ferdinand a 'f****** black c***'. The prosecution said he his words came in response to taunts about his alleged affair with a team-mate's ex-girlfriend. Wesminster magistrates were told that Terry told Ferdinand to 'f*** off"" and also called him a ""f****** k*******' as the pair exchanged insults. It is not the first time Terry has been involved in a handshake row.

Harriet was given the wig, which will last for a year, from Hairoom in Bury, after her parents got in touch with the hair replacement specialists. They were worried that her alopecia might set her apart from her new class mates. The youngster originally had . shoulder-length golden hair. But she woke up one day last September and . found that it had fallen out over her pillow. Within a week, Harriet was bald and she had to wear a head scarf.

Private school pupil Zoe Miller, 13, was said to be in the habit of taking exercise to help her sleep. An inquest heard she enjoyed skipping and running to burn off energy, and on the night in question had  clambered on to the parapet of a bridge to cross over railway tracks. Energetic Zoe Miller was trying to burn off some energy in one of her . typical late night runs, but when she was standing on a bridge lost her . balance when a speeding train passed beneath her . When a 60mph train passed underneath in the dark she is thought to have become 'disorientated' and fallen on to it. Her body was spotted the next morning by another train driver as he passed through Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. Zoe's parents, who live 100 yards away, had already realised that their daughter was missing and police contacted them shortly afterwards with the devastating news. The inquest heard how Zoe's footprints had been found on a set of metal . railings leading up to the bridge and it would have been an easy step up . onto the parapet . The adventurous teenager plunged to her death, the inquest heard, after walking barefoot to the bridge. Her body was not discovered until the following morning . Deputy coroner Graham Danbury heard . that Zoe had spent much of her life in South Africa, Nigeria and Zambia . where she regularly went out walking or running barefoot to help her . sleep. She returned to the UK last summer . with her mother Jane, 46, a senior health adviser for the Department for . International Development, father Rob, 48, a scientist specialising in . storing biological data, and sister Sam, 11. Her parents released a statement after the inquest in which they said they 'miss her desperately'. The happy teenager died when she fell from the bridge over the railway lines on Ivy House Lane in Berkhamstead . The coroner's court heard how Zoe slipped out into the garden and made her way to the bridge on the fateful night in April this year . They added: 'We are privileged to . have memories of nearly 14 wonderful years travelling the world with . Zoe, and her adventurous free spirit will remain in our hearts for ever. We are now doing our best to move forward as a family of three.' The court heard that Zoe was told to . go to bed at 10pm on April 22. The following morning her parents . discovered the back door closed but unlocked. Police believe she crept out and . walked to the bridge, which spans the busy West Coast line. The inquest . in Hatfield heard she probably used a roadside barrier and 3ft-tall . fence to climb on to the 5ft-tall stone parapet. A southbound train heading towards Euston went under the bridge at 11.45pm. It came to a stop after a brief loss of power but was allowed to continue after no problem was found. A post-mortem examination was carried out after Zoe's body was found at 6am. Her injuries were found to be consistent with falling on to a moving train. Detective Inspector Andrew  Rose said there was no evidence of anyone else being in the area at  the time. Diaries belonging to the pupil at £15,000-a-year all-girls Abbot's Hill School in Hemel Hempstead gave no indication that she was unhappy. 'Zoe was not a good sleeper and it was not unusual for her to go out at night and run around,' he said.Speaking shortly after her daughter's death, Mrs Miller said her school bag and uniform were laid out ready for classes the next day and she had not left a suicide note. Mr Danbury said: 'I am entirely satisfied this was a tragic accident.' A Network Rail spokesman said it was planning changes to the structure of the bridge.","Zoe Miller would often go for a 'late night skip' if she could not sleep .

Victim: Ryan King, 20, who died after he was stabbed in the neck with a glass bottle at a 40th birthday party in Devon . A former boxer murdered his great nephew by slashing his throat with a wine glass during a family party at a country mansion, a court has heard. Raymond Dupree is accused of killing 20-year-old Ryan King by stabbing him with a wine glass, after the elder man complained about music being played by teenage girls in the early hours. Mr King was said to have calmly stuck up for the 13- and 14-year-old girls who were at the gathering, held on August 20 last year to celebrate Mr King's pregnant mother's 40th birthday. Raymond Dupree, 68, argued with victim Ryan King, 20, after he intervened when Dupree told a group of 13 and 14-year-old girls to stop playing music. It was alleged that Mr King told him to calm down after he ordered the girls to go to bed at 3am on August 20, 2011. But Dupree responded by picking up a wine glass and stabbing it into his neck. The party was being held at a sprawling rural estate in South Molton, Devon, for Mr King's pregnant mother's 40th birthday. Witnesses said Dupree had been clenching a glass when he punched Mr . King in the neck as the party came to an end. As Mr King fell to the floor clutching his wound, Dupree . was said to have shown no remorse, saying: 'I’ve done him,' before . leaving the estate and walking home. A terrified Mr King told shocked onlookers that he thought he was going . to die, while friends frantically called for help. Mr King was taken to . hospital but died later as a result of his injuries. Speaking at the opening of the murder trial at Exeter Crown Court today, . prosecutor Simon Laws QC said Dupree 'grossly over-reacted to a trivial . dispute'. Mr Laws said: 'A recurring theme is that he believed Ryan owed him respect and it was disrespectful to stand up to him. He felt it was very serious, serious enough for him to lash out.' He added: 'There was simply no reason for Dupree to have used any . force at all, still less the fatal force that he actually used. 'Mr King lost his life quite needlessly. His death was a product of Dupree’s bad temper and his pride.' Exeter Crown Court heard Dupree and Mr King were among around 30 people . celebrating Lisa Wilson’s birthday at the luxury Snurridge Manor House . near South Molton in north Devon, which was owned by Dupree’s sister. Raymond John Dupree, accused of the murder of his great nephew Ryan King, leaves Exeter Magistrates Court . Revellers said the party was 'going well', with music, a buffet and karaoke. But, as guests began to leave the party, witnesses said the atmosphere began to change. Mr Laws told the court: 'Dupree was behaving in a manner which was, at the very least, overbearing. The court heard how Mr King, pictured, told Dupree to calm down after he ordered teenage girls to go to bed at 3am . 'Mr King intervened on behalf of a young girl that was bearing the brunt of the defendant’s temper.' He said Mr King asked Dupree to leave the girl alone, prompting Dupree to say his relative should 'respect his elders'. Dupree had apparently become angry that one girl had broken two glasses, . and that the teenagers, who had been drinking, should have been in bed. Giving evidence, Mr King’s friend Shane Thorne broke down in court as he recalled the attack. He said there had been 'a bit of a commotion about the music' at the . party, adding: 'Ryan followed [Dupree] into the kitchen to ask why he . was doing it to (squabbling with) his own family. 'Dupree hit Ryan in his throat with a glass. Ryan was really shaken up. I . walked up to him (Mr King) and saw the gash on his throat and all the . blood. 'He kept saying: ""I’m going to die"".' Dupree, who was stopped by police as he walked home from the party, . initially said the incident had been an accident, and that it was a 'family thing' that had got out of hand. He later said his great nephew had 'offered him outside for a fight' before launching a pre-emptive attack on the 20-year-old. Dupree, who . lived at nearby Bishop’s Nympton, denies murder.

A toddler was so badly mauled in a vicious dog attack that her tongue was left poking through a gaping hole in her cheek. But the owner of the Labrador collie, which savagely clamped its jaws around Lucy Harris' face, was fined just £250. The two-year-old was helping her mother Heidi, 26, clean the family car when the dog cross charged her and attacked her on July 22. Brutal: Lucy Harris, 2, is pictured left with her open wounds and right, following 30 stitches to her face, after the savage dog attack which left her tongue poking through a hole in her cheek . Distraught Mrs Harris rushed to Lucy's aid and managed to prize the youngster from the animal's jaws as it pinned the helpless girl down to the ground. Lucy’s dad Gary Barratt, 43, rushed her . to hospital after he checked her bloodied face and shockingly found her . tongue sticking out of a hole in her cheek. Medics needed more than 30 stitches to stop the bleeding and piece the fragile toddler's face back together. But there was nothing doctors could do to stop the permanent scar now etched on her cheek. Her family said Lucy has been deeply traumatised by the attack, which has shattered her confidence and made her terrified of strangers and any animals she sees. They believe Lucy would have died if her mum hadn’t been there to rescue her from the dog’s snapping jaws. The animal, called Dobbie, had belonged to the family’s neighbour Margaret Wright who had been saying goodbye to a friend when the creature dashed out her front door. Wright, who lives a few doors away, claimed her pet was not violent - and said the animal only bit the girl because she touched his sore ear. Wright, 60, admitted to her dog being out of control in a public place and could have faced up to two years behind bars, or a fine running into thousands of pounds. But instead she was ordered her to pay just £250 in compensation and £45 legal costs following a hearing at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Friday. Lucy's parents said the toddler is now a 'shadow of her former self' and suffers trauma after the attack . The young girl’s family today said they felt 'sickened' by the soft sentence that they said won’t stop other dangerous dog owners letting their dogs run wild. Mother-of-three Heidi, who lives in Cambridge, said: 'The attack was so horrific. 'It had been a lovely day we were outside cleaning the car. I then heard this almighty scream and saw the dog biting my daughters face. 'She had a chunk of flesh torn from her face it was the worst thing I have ever seen . 'She has not been the same since the attack, she gets very shy and seems to have no confidence and what’s more she might have permanent scarring on her face. 'So when the court ruled we were just to get £250 I was sickened. 'My little girl could have died if I had not intervened. This is a hugely traumatic moment in her life but it seems as though that doesn’t really matter it the eyes of the court. 'She may need further surgery or counseling in the future and who is supposed to pay for that? 'This isn’t sending out the right message to the owners of potentially dangerous dogs.' Immediately . after the attack,  Lucy was rushed to Addenbrooke’s hospital by her . parents where she underwent two hours of emergency surgery and was kept . in for three days. Her parents say the poor youngster is now a 'shadow of her former self' and suffers psychological trauma following the attack. Lucy is also terrified of all animals, struggles at nursery school and regularly points to her face saying 'Naughty Dobbie'. Heidi Harris, from Cambridge, left, holding her daughter Lucy, also right, who is terrified of all animals . Her furious dad Gary, a window cleaner, said: 'I have never seen anything like it. 'There was blood everywhere. I was stunned but also furious - I could have killed that dog. 'The attack was absolutely atrocious she is my little girl and she was savagely attacked by this dog. 'And it felt like the courts were just rubbing salt into our wounds when the owner of the creature was just ordered to pay £250. 'Is my daughters well-being worth just £250? It is an absolute joke. Lucy has just started nursery and all the kids are asking what has happened to her face. 'I hope the scar will fade away but when I look at her my heart drops.' During the court hearing on Friday Yetunde Fawehinmi, prosecuting, said: 'The girl’s mother saw her daughter had drifted away and the next she heard was screaming. 'She saw the dog attacking the child and biting her face.' She added: 'The child wouldn’t stop screaming so they called for an ambulance and were taken to hospital.' Jim Dignan, defending, said Wright was a responsible dog owner and this attack came out of the blue. He said: 'My client said the dog would not bite a child unless it had a reason to do so. 'The dog had a sore ear and if the child touched the dog’s ear then the dog may have reacted to that with a bite.' Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, owners of dogs found to be out of control can be sent to prison for up to six months and/or fined. Owners whose pets harm someone can be sent to prison for up to two years and/or fined up to 175 per cent of weekly earnings.

Despite a recent housing crisis, apartments in New York City’s so-called 'billionaire building' in the heart of Manhattan are going fast, but who's buying? Although the 1,004-foot tower is not yet completed, orders are pouring in, with only about 40 of the 92 living spaces reportedly remaining at One57, located at the southern edge of Central Park. But living at One57, located at 157 W. 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, is limited to those of the billionaire set, with apartments going for $45million and up. Those who are scooping up property in Manhattan’s most luxurious of luxury high rises are being kept under wraps. Scroll down for video . A look inside: A model of a typical apartment in One57 shows sleek lacquered interiors with high ceilings . Tyranny of choice: Buyers can chose between one of two finishes for their apartment - the white cabinetry creates a fresh, airy look . Discreet: Seeming kitchen cabinets turn into extra seating that can just as easily be pushed back in . The New York Times reported that orders to purchase an apartment in the incredible building have come in from all over the world, including China, Great Britain, Canada and several from the U.S. Gary Barnett, the president of developer the Extell Development Company, told the paper that several of the new buyers are ‘significant Forbes billionaires.' The celebrity buyers are kept under super secrecy, but the Times has let slip that three future residents already own property at another exclusive Manhattan building - 15 Central Park West. So which of those A-listers will it be? Actor Denzel Washington? Singer Sting? NBC sportscaster Bob Costas? Mystery buyers? Little is known about those seeking to move into One57, but three of them live or have lived at 15 Central Park West, like Denzel Washington and NBC sportscaster Bob Costas . Moving on up? Singer Sting may also be looking for a housing upgrade after buying property at 15 Central Park West . These are just a few of the names that live or have lived at 15 Central Park West who may have traded up. But regardless of the new property owners, each is getting what they’re paying for - and they’re paying a boatload. Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a property appraiser, told The Times: 'The scale of wealth in this building is just unheard of. Despite all the problems economically, you are seeing these people invest in real estate unlike in any period that has ever happened.' For the price, high-rolling buyers paying millions of dollars for their places of residence at One57 expect nothing but the best, but they shouldn’t be disappointed. A recent video tour of the sales building in Midtown shows what millions of dollars can by, with top-of-the-line appliances, materials, and even offer a television in the bathroom. What to do on the loo: The bathroom offers a high-definition television, for times when magazines just don't cut it . Refreshing: Two 36-inch refrigerators offer plenty of storage for fresh produce and chilled beverages . Centre of the world: Director of Sales Dan Tubb shows Forbes' Morgan Brennan the development model . Seeing for miles: The two viewed a rendered view from the sales room 'living room' In May, Forbes Magazine sent Morgan Brennan to get a look of . the inside spaces in a build-out model at their Midtown sales office, . and was guided around the model apartments by Director of Sales Dan . Tubb. The gourmet kitchen features outward ventilation and two dishwashers for units of three bedrooms and above. The . kitchen, which comes in two possible finishes, also includes two . 36-inch refrigerators, granite counter tops, extensive storage, and a . full-sized wine cooler. Some cabinets are not what they seem and pull out from the kitchen island to become stools. One penthouse suite was sold for a record fee in excess of $90million - and the new owner hasn't even seen it yet. The astronomical fee eclipses the $88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West. It proves that while the economic situation may be precarious some still have deep enough pockets to splash out super properties. Sky high: The prime minister of Qatar has been revealed as the mystery buyer who spent almost $100 million to purchase New York City's most expensive penthouse back in May . Loss: The sheik called off a deal to purchase a $100million penthouse in the not-yet-completed One57 building, complete with 10,923 square feet and breathtaking views of the city skyline . The view: When completed, the towering One57 building will provide unparalleled views of Central Park . A plan for a his-and-her master bathroom boasts incredible south-facing views of the Empire State building 23 blocks away . A 'recognisable' buyer has snapped up a penthouse on the 89th and 90th floor of the under-construction One57 tower block for a reported price of about $95million. In exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 10,923-square-foot space opposite Carnegie Hall with incredible views over the city. The high sum is thought to be due to uncertainty abroad, which has led foreign investors taking a greater interest in New York real estate. Situated on 157 West 57th street the tower will become the tallest residential building in the city when it is finished next year. The New York Post has reported that some potential buyers have claimed there are 'design flaws' with the construction - namely that builders failed to provide a sufficient number of elevators. But new owner of the high-rise apartment who according to Extell chairman Gary Barnett is from a 'nice family' clearly didn't share the same concerns. The building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to see their prices fall. No doubt the owners will be able to afford good window treatments if they want to block out the incredible lights visible from the master bedroom in order to sleep .

Victims of Bernard Madoff's fraud will soon receive $2.48 billion to help cover their losses. The payout more than triples their total recovery to about $3.63 billion, but is still only half of what was lost, the trustee liquidating the imprisoned swindler's firm said. Checks ranging from $1,784 to $526.9 million were mailed on Wednesday to 1,230 former customers of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, according to trustee Irving Picard. The average payout is $2.02 million. Fraudster: 1,230 victims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme lost an estimated total of $9.15 billion. Left, pictured in his police mugshot, right, leaving court during his trial . Irving Picard, bankruptcy trustee in the Bernard Madoff case, exits the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in February . Madoff's victims earlier recovered . $1.15 billion, including sums committed by the Securities Investor . Protection Corp, which helps customers of failed brokerages. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland . in Manhattan authorized the latest distribution last month following two . legal victories for the trustee. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court decision that endorsed Picard's methods for calculating losses. In . July, a former Madoff customer dropped a court challenge to a $7.2 . billion forfeiture by the estate of Madoff investor Jeffry Picower. Of . that sum, $5 billion would go to the Madoff firm's estate, and the rest . to the U.S. government. Picard has recovered $9.15 billion, or 53 per cent of the $17.3 billion he believes was lost in Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The trustee is holding some funds in reserve as some Madoff victims pursue their own cases to recover more money. Picard said this litigation is delaying further distributions. The . trustee is also appealing court decisions that have limited his claims . against banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co that did business with . Madoff. A spokeswoman for Picard was not immediately available to comment on the latest distribution. The . market for trading claims on potential recoveries from Madoff's estate . will adjust for the distribution, according to Joseph Sarachek. Angry: Demonstrators hold a protest warning investors that they too could become victims of a Wall Street fraud . Happier times: Bernard Madoff (left) with his wife Ruth Madoff and son Mark Madoff in November 2001 . Sarachek is the managing director of claims trading at CRT Capital Group LLC, a Stamford, Connecticut-based broker-dealer. He said claims that recently traded at around 69 cents on the dollar will likely soon trade in the 30s. 'The Madoff market is fairly volatile,' Sarachek said. 'The real question is when people think the next distribution will be.' Lifland has authorized Picard and his law firm, Baker & Hostetler, to bill $321.2 million of legal fees to pursue Madoff cases for the period ended January 31, 2012. Mark Madoff, one of Bernard Madoff's sons, was found dead on Saturday, Dec. 11, 2010 having committed suicide at an apartment that is now up for rent . Madoff was arrested in December 2008 and pleaded guilty three months later. The 74-year-old is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison. Madoff used his London trading operation to try to cover up his 20-year deception and wired millions to and from his Mayfair-based subsidiary in a money laundering operation to make it look as though he was investing in European markets. He solicited billions from customers around the world under the pretence that it was being invested in securities. In reality, he was simply depositing the money straight into a number of bank accounts. The con was exposed in December 2010, after the financial meltdown meant many of his investors demanded their money back, but couldn't get it. He claimed he was holding $76billion worth of investors' money. In reality, his assets had dwindled to a fraction of that.

So when the model, her husband Alex Mehran and their 10-month-old son Zander landed in San Francisco from New York earlier this month, the last thing they expected to hear was that one of their two dogs didn't make it. 'We drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hangar were told simply, “One of them is dead” by the emotionless worker who seemed more interested in his text messages,' Maggie wrote in a heated web post on Thursday titled: 'United Airlines Killed Our Golden Retriever.' Killed: Bea, a two-year-old golden retriever died earlier this month from heatstroke, according to a veterinarian's report, suffered while travelling on a United Airlines flight .

Having heard stories of pets not surviving flights before - though Bea and her other two dogs Al and Hen have flown previously - the nervous owner says she took every precaution her and her husband could think of to ensure their safety, including a full health examination four days before, as required by United's PetSafe flight programme. After a six-hour drive to New York City to avoid a connecting flight that could potentially stress or separate their dogs, she says she paid the airline $1,800 in addition to their plane tickets to ensure their pets' safety as passengers. However, it seems that the airline failed to keep its promises about the dogs. '[The airline] didn't even have an excuse,' she told PEOPLE Magazine this week. After retrieving their dog's body, which they were originally told had already been sent to a local vet for an autopsy, Maggie’s own veterinarian determined that Bea had died from heatstroke. ‘She died 30 feet below us, alone and . scared. Nobody was there to help her because someone made a mistake,’ Maggie told PEOPLE of the dog that had been given to the couple at . their wedding in 2010. Healthy and loved: The golden retriever, seen cuddling with Maggie's husband Alex Mehran, had undergone a health inspection just four days before their flight from New York to San Francisco, California . Family: Bea was one of three dogs belonging to the couple, Al and Hen pictured with them, after gifted at their wedding in 2010 . 'We understand that the loss of a beloved pet is difficult and express our condolences to Ms Rizer and her family for their loss,’ United told PEOPLE in a statement. 'After careful review, we found there were no mechanical operational issues with Bea's flight and also determined she was in a temperature-controlled environment for her entire journey. We would like [to] finalize the review but are unable until we receive a copy of the necropsy.’ 'I am disappointed by United's statement and continued show of disrespect,' Maggie retorted in her own written statement on her Facebook page on Thursday. Despite her anger the model, married to an IBM heir, writes that she doesn't plan to file a lawsuit or become . an advocate against the airline. Stern warning: Bea is seen snoozing in Maggie's home in an earlier taken photo, with the heartbroken owner now warning pet owners about flying with their pets . 'I am writing this to help make people aware that airlines are incapable of ensuring the safety of our pets. All it takes is for one employee to not follow the proper procedure and then like me, your dog is dead.' Responding to condolences on her Facebook page this week, Maggie showed her appreciation for her compassionate friends and fans. 'Thank you for the kind thoughts. She was an amazing dog with a heart of gold. So incredibly happy and sweet, so lovable. We still cannot believe she is gone. She will be missed more then I can express.

But incredibly, five months later, her precious note hit land in Largs Bay Beach near Adelaide, southern Australia - 10,000 miles away from where it plopped in the water in Dorset, where she was on holiday with her family. Incredible: Four-year-old Jasmine threw her message in a bottle into the English Channel at Bournemouth and it washed up on a beach 10,000 miles away in Australia .

Murmurings about his leadership and dreadful poll ratings, Mr Clegg will be grateful of praise coming from any quarter. Boris Johnson said Nick Clegg is 'probably a natural Tory' as he set out why the Lib Dem must survive as leader . ‘It is time for us Clegg fans to echo those kindly folk who are trying to save the sweet furry badgers from the wrath of farmers,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘Never mind the badgers – save the Cleggster from extermination!’ But the support of one of the . country’s best known Conservatives will not be universally welcomed by . Lib Dem activists. At one point Mr Johnson says Mr Clegg ‘probably a . natural Tory’ aside from his views on Europe. And . in a backhanded compliment he delights in the ‘utterly hopeless’ Lib . Dem campaigns for a new voting system and an elected House of Lords . which helped preserve the status quo. Opinion polls carried out to make the start of this week’s Lib Dem conference made grim reading for Mr Clegg. Boris Johnson compared Nick Clegg's plight to the government's looming badger cull: ¿Never mind the badgers ¿ save the Cleggster from extermination!¿ . In one his net satisfaction ratings had dropped to -63, a new low. In a survey of party members for the LibDemVoice website, his approval rating had dropped into negative territory for the first time, down to minus two points. Four in five Lib Dem members also fear being in coalition will be bad for the party's election prospects in 2015. But Mr Johnson insist that without Mr Clegg’s bold decision to form a coalition, Gordon Brown would still be in power, and George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove would not have been able to embark on major economic, welfare and education reforms. He also hails Mr Clegg as ‘a very nice chap indeed’ who is ‘very good at tennis’, though keeps losing to David Cameron. ‘His wife, Miriam González Durántez, is every bit as lovely and clever and funny as she appears,’ Mr Johnson wrote in The Daily Telegraph. ‘I have always thought that if you leave out Europe, he is probably a natural Tory. ‘He is certainly tough, and can take a joke.’ Whether Mr Clegg can see the funny side to being lauded by Mr Johnson remains to be seen.","London Mayor says Lib Dem leader is 'probably a natural Tory'

Geoffrey Andrews tried to get his ex-wife sacked from her job as a primary school teacher . A vindictive husband launched a campaign of revenge against his teacher ex-wife by falsely claiming she was a swinger and had been caught dogging. Geoffrey Andrews created a fictitious Facebook profile and sent messages to the council, his local newspaper, and the school where she worked claiming she was unfit to teach in a bitter attempt to get her sacked. The 34-year-old, who has a 12-year-old daughter with his ex-wife, appeared at Bolton Magistrates’ Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to harassment without violence over three weeks in January last year. Andrews, from Bromley Cross in Bolton, created a false profile on Facebook which he used to befriend his ex-wife, who has not been named, by claiming he was a new teacher at the school. He also hacked into her email address and set up two accounts on swinger’s websites in her name. The father-of-three created a false email address for a ‘Mike Jones’, which he used to contact Wigan Council, Meadowbank Primary School in Atherton, Greater Manchester, and The Bolton News, in an attempt to damage her name. The email sent to The Bolton News claimed that Andrews’ ex-wife had been reported to Ofsted by worried parents and to the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud. It also listed sexual habits that he claimed she pursued and said she had been caught dogging. But after investigations the newspaper did not go ahead with the story.

He could have actually lost her her job. Andrews set up two accounts on swingers websites in his ex-wife's name as part of his bitter campaign . 'If The Bolton News had printed any of the information it could have had a devastating effect on her and her daughter.’ The couple married in 1999 but separated in 2005 and finally divorced in 2008. Andrews has since re-married and his new wife is pregnant with the couple’s second child. Adam Whittaker, defending, said it was ‘stupid’ and ‘foolish’ and Andrews ‘deeply regrets his actions’.

THE Environment Secretary has been targeted by animal rights militants who have published photos of his home online as part of a campaign of ‘intimidation’ against a controversial badger cull. Concerns: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who last week approved the badger cull trials . Owen Paterson – who last week approved the cull in Gloucestershire to try to stop the spread of TB among cattle – was forced to obtain a High Court injunction against the website, which also lists his address and office phone number. Although activists removed the information, within hours it  had reappeared on a ‘mirror’ site hosted in Australia but easily accessible in the UK through a simple Google search. The website claims a high-level Civil Service mole, sympathetic to their cause, went ‘out on a limb’ to leak the private details. It has also published addresses and phone numbers for senior Defra civil servants, board members of Natural England, which is licensing the cull, and officials at the National Farmers Union. The Mail on Sunday is not revealing details of the website to protect those named. We have also established the identity of the British woman behind it but for legal reasons – linked to an unrelated police investigation – she cannot be named. The site, which advises protesters to ‘stay legal’, carries photographs of Mr Paterson’s North Shropshire home under the headline ‘House on the hill. Owen Paterson has a posh place’. There is also an aerial shot and a view of the main entrance gates – key information for any extremist planning to trespass. It will also concern police given Mr Paterson’s previous role as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, where he was an obvious target for terrorist groups. Text on the anti-cull website boasts Mr Paterson is ‘very, very angry about the site publishing his office phone number. Many people are ringing it and playing the “badger badger” song to him’. This is a reference to a YouTube video in which cartoon badgers dance to a soundtrack. Scroll down for video . Culled: Badgers are to be culled in a bid to stop the spread of TB among cattle . The website adds: ‘Below is the rest of the ministers [sic], this was leaked to us by someone who is high up in the civil service. Please put a few minutes to one side each day to contact them.’ Martin Haworth, director of policy at the National Farmers Union, said: ‘We are very disappointed this has happened. We have asked Defra and Natural England how this information could have been discovered.’ Natural England declined to comment on the leak ‘for security reasons’. A Defra spokesman said last night that its databases had not been compromised. Police are preparing for fast-track prosecutions against activists who launch night protests against the badger cull. Farmers taking part have been asked to sign a police witness statement known as an MG11, saying they have not given permission for anyone to disrupt the cull. By collecting the forms in advance, police hope they can bring about charges more quickly. Animal rights activists have been accused of using the travel website TripAdvisor to harass a farmer organising the badger cull. Harassed: Jan Rowe . Jan Rowe, 67, says that militants have posted malicious reviews about his wife Gill’s farmhouse B&B in an attempt to undermine her business. The comments appeared shortly after the names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers of farmers allegedly involved in the cull were published on the internet. Mr Rowe said: ‘It was obvious they were by animal rights people. They said the smell was terrible and suggested it was caused by the badgers we had nailed to the wall. ‘There were similar comments and it was clear they were from people who had never been here. Someone even wrote we would take guests badger-hunting. It was all nonsense. But it is deeply upsetting for my wife.’ Although Mr Rowe’s farm in Whittington, near Cheltenham, is outside the area of the Gloucestershire cull, he has become a target after agreeing to be a director of GlosCon Ltd – the firm set up to organise it. TripAdvisor has since taken down the offending review .","Website claims information came from a sympathetic high-level Civil Service mole .

Sandsculptors have travelled from all over the world, determined to make their mark in the sand at the 2012 North American Sandsculpting Championship which started this week. They have 24 hours over three days to transform mountains of sand into amazing creations at Virginia Beach, Virginia. Sand sensation: Bagrat Stepanian puts some last minute touches on a sand sculpture created along with Pavel Mylnikov from Russia, for the 2012 North American Sandsculpting Championship . Even the sand, all 450 tonnes of it, is imported to the beach from Currituck County, North Carolina in the annual competition with $55,000 up for grabs, the largest amount of prize money for sandsculpting in America. The sculptors have been working tirelessly under a football field-sized tent, to ensure their work survives the wind and rain during the 10-day Neptune Festival, of which the competition is a part. Sculptor Benjamin Probanza from Mexico said: ‘It feels like a gallery – more professional’ according to HamptonRoads.com. Under the tent there was 22 sand sculptures created by 12 solo artists and 10 doubles who have come from Singapore, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Russia, Italy and Canada and many other countries. Tonnes to turn: Benjamin Probanza from Mexico works on his sculpture made of sand, imported from North Carolina to Virginia Beach. Organisers imported 450 tonnes of sand specially for the competition . The sculptors, competing by invitation only, use all kinds of tools to mould the sand, from trowels to feather dusters but are limited on materials. They can use only sand, water and ‘finishing spray’ which is watered-down wood glue. No supports, foreign objects or other accessories. One team, Wilfred Stijger and Edith van de Wetering from Holland, met at a sandsculpting competition 15 years ago. Mr Stijger said: ‘It's performance art, not meant to last. ‘You can forgive mistakes in sand that you could not forgive in stone. Besides, there are girls in bikinis down here.’ Sue McGrew, an artist from Seattle, watched her 9ft sand sculpture collapse late on Wednesday. She said: ‘I was hollowing out the back, and I pushed it beyond its limits. ‘It happens. It's sand.’","Thirty two sculptors from around the world competed in the 2012 North American Sandsculpting Championship this week .

Mitt Romney today overcame one hurdle on the path to the White House - he was declared healthy enough to be President. The 65-year-Republican was described by his personal doctor as 'a healthy-appearing, energetic, strong, physically fit male' in a letter released by his campaign on Friday. Those considering voting for him will doubtless be relieved to hear that he has never suffered from HIV, cancer or epilepsy, and does not take illegal drugs. But the document revealed that Mr Romney does have some medical issues - he is allergic to penicillin, has an enlarged prostate, and takes daily drugs to combat his high cholesterol. Fighting fit: But Mitt Romney, pictured in Las Vegas on Friday, has an allergy to penicillin . The former governor of Massachusetts and his running mate Paul Ryan each released a message from their doctors designed to show that the pair have the physical ability to take on the presidency and vice-presidency. Mr Romney's doctor is Randall D. Gaz, of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who has been treating the politican since 1989. His letter noted that the candidate has been involved in few major medical emergencies, bar 'a concussion and fractures' sustained in a car crash in 1968. But Dr Gaz revealed that his patient takes aspirin and Lipitor daily - though never penicillin, to which Mr Romney has an allergy. Active: The candidate, pictured at his grandson's soccer game, has an unusually low heart rate . The doctor praised Mr Romney's healthy lifestyle and 'high fiber diet', saying: 'He totally abstains from drinking any alcoholic beverages, and does not use any tobacco products or illicit drugs.' As a Mormon, the former governor is forbidden from using alcohol, tobacco and narcotics. Mr Romney's resting heart rate is apparently 'in the 40s' - more characteristic of a professional athlete than a senior citizen. However, Dr Gaz warned that the Romney family had a history of heart problems and prostate cancer, adding that his patient knew to monitor signs related to these conditions. Exercise: Paul Ryan is known for his love of running and his vigorous training regime . The letter set out a summary of Mr Romney's most recent physical exam, which took place last month and 'revealed a healthy-appearing, energetic, strong, physically fit male' who 'appears years younger than his age'. Dr Gaz concluded with a thorough endorsement of his patient's medical health - and what appears to be an endorsement of his political ambitions too. 'He is vigorous man who takes excellent care of his personal physical health,' the letter said. 'He has reserves of strength, energy and stamina that provide him with the ability to meet unexpected demands. 'There are no physical impairments that should interfere with his rigorous and demanding political career as the next president of the United States.' Good health: The last physical undergone by the President, pictured in Virginia on Friday, had positive results . Mr Ryan, the 42-year-old Wisconsin congressman, is known for his exercise regime and is intensely proud of his own physical fitness. Brian P. Monahan, Attending Physician to the U.S. Congress, said Mr Ryan's 'overall health is excellent' despite his family history of fatal heart attacks. According to the doctor's letter, the congressman does not smoke and his alcohol use is 'infrequent'. Barack Obama releases the results of his annual physical, which last year declared him in excellent health and praised him for quitting smoking.

That is because with its blinking, strobing, technicoloured lights, the metal saucer-shaped home of retired industrial arts teacher Roberto Sanchez Rivera, 58, is meant to look just like a grounded UFO. Resting on the slopes of Juana Diaz in Puerto Rico, the otherwordly house exists only to prove a girl wrong after 40-years, and all because Rivera suffered the same fate of many geeks across the planet - he was dumped. Scroll Down for Video . This flying saucer shaped UFO is the home of retired industrial arts teacher Roberto Sanchez Rivera, 58, who built the house to prove to an ex-girlfriend that he could do whatever he put his mind to . As a love-struck teenager, Rivera was an artistic student from a poor family and he would send his girlfriend love notes with little UFO's drawn round the side. He promised he would one day build a home for the two of them that resembled the flashing flying saucers of the B-movies that they used to watch in the local movie theater. The home of Roberto Rivera who built his home to resemble a flying saucer using mostly discount-store knickknacks and discarded auto parts . The living-room in the home of Roberto Rivera featuring car seats and tables made from car windows . However, one day, after three months of seeing each other she unceremoniously ended the relationship with a Dear John note, sending Rivera to the brink of suicide as he contemplated jumping from the 13th floor of his apartment. 'It ended because she wrote him a letter saying she did not want to continue the relationship, because she didn't love him anymore,' said Maria Martinez, the 56-year-old current girlfriend of Rivera who lives with him in the UFO home and translates English for him. 'It was the mother who explained to him that her daughter had said that he would never amount to anything in life. He was shocked. 'He used to live on the 13th floor, and he wanted to throw himself off, but he held himself back and said, ‘No, I’m going to show her, this person, I’m going to work that much harder to show her who I am.’ Roberto Rivera, (right), with Maria Martinez on the roof of his flying saucer home in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico . Completing his studies at Pontifical Catholic University in Ponce, Rivera studied design and fine arts, and resolved to build his UFO house and make it with his own hands. Purchasing the land in 2002 for $95,000, Rivera spent the next ten years and $150,000 constructing his unusual futuristic home - even wiring it up to emit the famous five tone signature theme from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The spot he picked is visible for miles around by drivers on the passing highway and Rivera intentionally chose the hillside so that the unnamed girl who broke his heart would see the UFO home and know that he had amounted to something. 'He wanted to do it in a certain spot, so that if she were to travel she would see it day in and day out and regret those words,' said Maria Martinez to the New York Times. Scrimping and saving over the ten years it took him to build the house, Rivera fitted out his home not with expensive high tech appliances, but with dollar-store ashtrays made to resemble antennae and used $1.99 salad bowls for his flashing light fixtures. Although not quite as impressive as this still from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Rivera's home was still good enough to re-capture the heart of his first love . He built the cupboards by hand and even fashioned the toilet seat in his flying saucer house to match the alien surroundings that he wanted to create. Most of the furniture in the home is raised off the ground - Rivera says this reminds of him living in the barrio and having to lift furniture to keep the home clean and tidy. As the fame of his alien house on the hillside grew in the surrounding area, Rivera received an unusual visit four years ago in the dead of night - the girl who had broken his heart 40-years ago. During those years he had married, had two children and divorced himself, but his first love called him up out of the blue and he invited her to see the home which he had built with any piece of scrap metal he could find. The octagon home was in its final stages of completion and the girl was so impressed she told Rivera that she wanted to get back together with him, but Rivera knew that finally his feelings for the girl had gone and turned her down. Satisfied that he had completed what he promised himself he would, Rivera, who claims he has no interest in science-fiction has advice for anyone who finds himself in the same predicament. 'You should never say to any human being, 'You can never accomplish anything in life.'","Roberto Sanchez Rivera built his flying saucer home to complete a promise he made to a girl who ended their relationship by a letter 40-years-ago .

Inspiration: Tom Sawyer (pictured) and Mark Twain first met in a San Francisco bath house in 1863 and the two became drinking buddies . Tom Sawyer is known to generations as one of the most beloved characters in American literature, but new research into the man that inspired the fictional child shows that his real life counterpart was a hard-drinking fire fighter-turned-barkeep. Author Mark Twain was thought to have based his adventurous Southern child character on his acquaintance named Tom Sawyer, and the writer's admiration for his fire-fighting friend was so strong that he gave the character the man's name in homage. A lengthy article published by The Smithsonian details the relationship between Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, and Sawyer who met in a bath house in San Francisco during the mid 19th century. The two had many adventures together, gambling in Nevada and drinking in seemingly every saloon that San Francisco had to offer. Sawyer was born in Brooklyn and moved to California where he worked as a volunteer fire fighter, policeman and customs officer. Sawyer and Twain connected over their shared experiences with steamboats. Before making his way out West, Sawyer used his notable strength to save 90 people from a fiery shipwreck. Though such actions would rightfully earn anyone's respect, Twain was particularly moved by the story because his own brother died in a tragic fire while working on a similar steamboat. The two men became fast friends after meeting in 1863, with Sawyer travelling to Virginia City, Nevada, at one point to visit Twain while he was working as a correspondent there. Retiring to the bar: After many years as a volunteer fire fighter, Sawyer retired and worked running a saloon . After one particularly heady night once the two men returned to San Francisco, Twain put his infamous hallow leg to the test and proclaimed to his friend that he would base a character in his yet-unwritten book on him. 'He walks up to me and puts both hands on my shoulders. ""Tom,"" he says, ""I’m going to write a book about a boy and the kind I have in mind was just about the toughest boy in the world. Tom, he was just such a boy as you must have been....How many copies will you take, Tom, half cash?""' Sawyer told a local reporter shortly after Twain's first usage of the character in a book in 1876. On another- potentially more sober- instance, Twain repeated the plan to Sawyer, who always referred to him by his given name. 'One day he says to me: ""I am going to put you between the covers of a book some of these days, Tom."" ""Go ahead, Sam,"" I said, ‘but don’t disgrace my name,""' Sawyer said. Besides their fondness of brandy, the two men also shared a propensity for storytelling, and Sawyer believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood inspired Twain to create a version of his friend in his child form. The man named Sam: Sawyer called Twain (pictured left and right) by his given name, Sam Clemens, and the two men initially bonded over their shared appreciation of steamboats . Growing city: The two had many adventures together, gambling in Nevada and drinking in seemingly every saloon that 19th-century San Francisco (pictured) had to offer . 'We both was fond of telling stories and spinning yarns. Sam, he was mighty fond of children’s doings and whenever he’d see any little fellers a-fighting on the street, he’d always stop and watch ’em and then he’d come up to the Blue Wing and describe the whole doings and then I’d try and beat his yarn by telling him of the antics I used to play when I was a kid and say, ""I don’t believe there ever was such another little devil ever lived as I was."" Sam, he would listen to these pranks of mine with great interest and he’d occasionally take ’em down in his notebook,' Sawyer said. Initially Twain said that the character of Tom Sawyer was based a compilation of three real people: John B. Briggs, William Bowen, and Twain himself. In spite of such pronouncements, the historical evidence that Twain and the fire fighter version of Sawyer were close proves that there was likely a fourth, more prominent influencer in the creative mix.","Mark Twain was close friends with a man named Tom Sawyer when he lived in San Francisco in 1863 .

Two nursery workers have been arrested after a three-year-old girl died when she got entangled in a rope while playing on a slide on her first day in day care. Police said the workers at York College Day Nursery were arrested on Monday and interviewed as part of ongoing inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death of Lydia Bishop on September 17. An inquest opening on Monday heard nursery staff and paramedics tried to save Lydia with CPR after she was found unresponsive on a slide in the outdoor playground with a rope tangled around her neck, it emerged today. York coroner Donald Coverdale said a number of children went to play outside some time after 2pm and it was believed that Lydia - whose first day it was at the nursery - wanted to use the slide. 'There came a time when a nursery worker spotted Lydia unresponsive on the slide, and there was a rope which had been attached to play equipment which was around her neck,' he said, opening the inquest into Lydia's death. 'I understand that staff immediately gave what help they could, administering CPR until paramedics arrived,' he said. The coroner said resuscitation attempts continued after the paramedics had taken Lydia to York Hospital, but it proved impossible to revive her, and it was confirmed at 3.27pm that she had died. A consultant pathologist, Dr Nigel Cooper, later carried out a post mortem examination and said the provisional cause of death was 'pressure on the neck.'

Just when you thought he'd damaged his campaign all he could, Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin has been ruffling feathers once more by bad-mouthing Sen. Claire McCaskill on Thursday. Things seemed to be looking up for the embattled Congressman, with a conservative fundraising group backing him with $290,000, despite his controversial 'legitimate rape' claims. But then he went and added fuel to the fire, accusing McCaskill of behaving in an unladylike manner. Claire McCaskill was less 'ladylike' in a debate last week than six years ago, Todd Akin claimed . Akin contrasted McCaskill's demeanor in their first debate last week with her approach six years ago. 'She was very aggressive in the debate, which was quite different than the way she was when she ran against Jim Talent' in 2006, Akin said during a campaign stop at the state capitol. At that time, he added, 'she had a confidence and was very much more sort of ladylike and all.' Akin's comment came moments after the Senate Conservatives Fund announced it was endorsing him. It was the highest-profile financial commitment Akin has netted since his campaign lost millions of dollars of planned advertising by other national groups that aid Republicans. Those groups withdrew their support after Akin remarked last month that women's bodies have ways of averting pregnancy in cases of 'legitimate rape'. Akin has apologized repeatedly since then but defied demands from top Republicans - including presidential nominee Mitt Romney - to quit the race. He's hoping his campaign can gain momentum now that he has let pass Tuesday's final deadline to drop out of the race. But staying in the contest has left Romney, running mate Paul Ryan and the rest of the GOP hierarchy in an awkward position. Putting on a show? U.S. Senate candidates for Missouri Todd Akin and Senator Claire McCaskill shake hands before a debate . The 'ladylike' comment complicated Akin's efforts and the broader contest for control of the Senate. Republicans need to gain four seats to win the majority, a task that seemed within reach a few months ago but has now grown uncertain, in part because of Akin's campaign. At the Missouri Capitol on Thursday, Akin said he believes he will get the votes of Republicans and Romney supporters and defeat McCaskill, who has close ties to President Barack Obama. Akin said thinks McCaskill believes he can win, too. He cited as evidence McCaskill's demeanor in a Missouri Press Association debate September 21, contrasting it with the way she debated then-Sen. Jim Talent in 2006. 'In the debate we had Friday, she came out swinging, and I think that's because she was threatened,' Akin said. McCaskill's campaign did not immediately comment about the remark, but others quickly denounced it, including Washington Sen. Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who called it 'demeaning to women and offensive to all'. Emily's List, which backs Democratic candidates who support abortion rights, quickly incorporated the remark into an email fundraising plea to finance more TV ads against Akin. 'Ladylike?! This is a Senate race, not a beauty pageant, Todd,' the group's new media director Emily Lockwood said in the email. The Senate Conservatives Fund said it endorsed Akin because he is the Republican nominee, the race against McCaskill remains competitive and Missouri is important to Republican efforts to gain the four seats necessary to win control of the Senate. The organization said its members had pledged $290,000 toward Akin's campaign, and it hopes to get $100,000 to Akin by Sunday, which is the cutoff for the quarterly financial reporting period. One Republican still supporting Akin is former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who raised money for him in suburban St. Louis on Monday . Akin said he was thankful and 'very enthusiastic' about winning the group's support. 'I think it's logical - I am a conservative, they're conservatives, I think it's a common-sense type of thing,' Akin said. The fund has gained prominence in recent years with the aid of Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., a favorite among tea party activists. Among other things, the Senate Conservatives Fund supports a ban on congressional spending earmarks, which use legislation to direct particular amounts of money to specific entities in a particular state or congressional district. Akin has used earmarks in the past to direct funding to such things as highway projects and military armor, although he and Matt Hoskins, the executive director of the Senate Conservatives Fund, both have said Akin supports the group's ban on earmarks. Akin said Thursday that he's against amendments that are slipped into bills at the last moment that direct money to specific projects, particularly if joint House and Senate conference committees add items that weren't in versions that originally passed the chambers. But he added: 'Don't take the definition (of earmark) so broadly that the members of Congress don't have any input into the budget process.' The aid from the Senate Conservatives Fund follows Akin's endorsement Wednesday by DeMint and former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, whose Patriot Voices political action committee said it was contributing money to Akin and hiring staff to work in Missouri. Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin and his wife Lulli Akin, left, take part in a news conference at the start of a statewide bus tour on Tuesday . The Freedom's Defense Fund, which backs conservative candidates, also said earlier this week that it planned a $250,000 advertising campaign benefiting Akin. But Akin will need even more outside help to keep pace with Democratic-leaning groups supporting McCaskill. Emily's List and the Service Employees International Union issued a joint statement Thursday saying they had bought $1 million in ads in support of McCaskill to run in the state's largest TV markets. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which already has spent about $1 million on TV ads in Missouri, has reserved $4.3 million of additional advertising to begin running October 9. The final deadline for candidates to remove their names from the . Missouri ballot passed Tuesday as Akin began his statewide bus tour, challenging  McCaskill. Top Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have urged him to drop out. He's also lost backing from the national GOP. But late on Tuesday Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, who'd called on Akin to quit . last month, reversed himself, saying he and Akin agreed 'the Senate . majority must change.' After winning the GOP primary in . August, Akin had gained quick backing from national Republican and . conservative groups focused on ousting McCaskill. But . that support withered after Akin was asked in an interview that aired on a St. Louis television station whether his general . opposition to abortion extended to women who have been raped. Akin has lost the support of the national GOP, but remains confident of defeating Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill . 'From . what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,' Akin said of a . woman becoming pregnant from rape. 'If it's a legitimate rape, the . female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' In the media storm immediately following . his remarks, Akin apologized repeatedly on national radio and TV shows . while acknowledging his original remarks were wrong. The chairman of the Republican National . Committee urged Akin to quit the Senate race, as did presumptive . Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, his vice presidential pick . Paul Ryan and every living Republican who has represented Missouri in . the Senate. Akin also has lost the financial . support for the political arm of Senate Republicans and of some powerful . interest groups, such as the Crossroads organization that is affiliated . with Republican strategist Karl Rove. One Republican still supporting Akin is former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who raised money for him in suburban St. Louis on Monday. At the event, Akin said he anticipates national Republican groups will resume their support of his candidacy in the days before the election. 'I think the money’s going to be coming,' Akin said, adding that the funds he needs to compete with McCaskill 'can come from a lot of different sources.' In a fundraising appeal e-mailed to supporters, Akin said he’s 'not going anywhere' following pressure from 'party bosses and Washington insiders.'","Todd Akin lambasted Claire McCaskill as being unladylike during campaign stop .

A miniature donkey, born with a deformed leg, is thriving after being fitted with one of the first prosthetic limbs to be created by equine surgeons. The young foal named Emma had her hind leg amputated at just two days old because it stopped her from standing. But she is now enjoying a new lease of life after vets at Auburn University, Alabama, managed to create a special artificial leg for her, similar to those used by Paralympic athletes. Scroll down for video . Miniature donkey Emma, pictured with her owner Cece Smith, proudly displaying her prosthesis limb which allows her to stand . The leg needs to be replaced every few months until Emma is fully grown, but at five months old, she is able to run around with the rest of her herd. She is now on her second prosthesis and experts predict she will need about seven different legs before she reaches adulthood. Dr Fred Caldwell, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical Sciences and equine surgeon at the university, performed the procedure and is working with clinician Billy Fletcher from Hanger Clinic. The clinic is part of the same company which created a prosthetic tail for Winter, the amputee dolphin and star of the film ‘Dolphin Tale’, who lost her tail after she was caught in a crab trap off the coast of Florida. Thanks to the artificial limb Emma can run around and jump like the rest of the group . She was fitted with the pink prosthesis after surgeons amputated her severely deformed leg which stopped her from walking . Dolphin trainer Cammie Zodrow with Winter the dolphin, who was fitted with a prosthetic tail by the same company who fitted Emma the miniature donkey with an artificial limb . The two worked out a plan to allow Emma time to heal from the surgery and transition from her cast to the prosthesis. Dr . Caldwell said: ‘Once we proceeded with the surgery and amputated the . distal limb, he provided a small footplate to incorporate into the cast . to even out the length of her hind limbs so she could bear weight until . we could get the surgical site healed and have her fitted with a . prosthesis. ‘It has been a group effort on behalf of many caring individuals willing to go to great lengths to save her.’ Emma's case is providing a unique teaching opportunity for the clinicians involved, as the practice of using prostheses with large horses is relatively uncommon due to size and weight-bearing limitations. But because Emma is a miniature donkey, even as an adult she will only weigh approximately 350 pounds once fully grown. A team of doctors and surgeons from Auburn University, Alabama, carefully fit Emma with her latest prosthesis . The veterinary team are excited at Emma's progress since she was fitted with the prosthetuic limb - which could soon be an option for all horses . Dr Caldwell added: ‘She absolutely loved it from the start. It was a very impressive design and she did very well in it. A close-up of Emma's first prosthetic limb which has enabled her to run . ‘She has progressed to the second . iteration of her prosthesis, which doesn't incorporate as much of the . limb and allows her more range of motion. She is getting stronger; she's . growing and doing wonderfully.’ The . prosthesis is made of carbon fibre, Kevlar and fibreglass, materials . that are strong and extremely light, and the same as though used for . prostheses for Paralympic athletes. The first finished prosthesis weighed less than a pound and the most recent iteration, which is pink, is smaller, but weighs a little more to provide stability as she's grown taller and almost doubled her weight since surgery. Prosthesis expert Billy said: ‘The next step is trying to make sure we keep the prosthesis set up so she's ambulatory and she can run and play and do things uninhibited, but also, to keep the area of concern, the surgical site, offloaded so Dr Caldwell can do his job in keeping her completely healed. ‘As time goes by, we'll continue to provide a prosthesis that's going to allow for growth. ‘We want to provide her with full range of motion, but also give her the ability to use full strength.’ Dr Caldwell added: ‘It's been very educational for me as an equine surgeon to learn; this has certainly been my first case. ‘I think we have a long way to go before we get to this being a procedure that's routinely an option for our larger patients, but for a prosthetic limb to be an option in horses is something that's pretty exciting.’ Emma has no problem grazing alongside the other ponies and horses in the field following the efforts of her veterinary team .","Emma the miniature donkey was born with a deformed leg which had to be amputated .

Murdered: Caroline Coyne, 28, was killed on her way home from a family party in Nottingham . A mother-of-two’s last moments alive were captured on CCTV as she tried to wave down a bus shortly before she was murdered by a sex attacker, a court has heard. Caroline Coyne, 28, is seen standing in the middle of the road waving her arms for the bus to stop before stepping out the way as it drives past. Just minutes later, Ms Coyne was allegedly grabbed by Carl Powell, 23, and battered to death as she fought to resist him. He denies murdering the young mother. A jury at Nottingham Crown Court were shown the brief clip of the mother of two waving down the bus on Porchester Road in Nottingham shortly after 1am on July 23 last year. The court heard the driver of the out-of-service bus, which was taking staff home after they had finished their shifts, had to brake and swerve to prevent his vehicle colliding with Ms Coyne. Police later traced motorists on the same road who recalled seeing Ms Coyne being followed by a man who the prosecution claim killed her. Prosecutor Stuart Rafferty QC told the court that minutes after trying to stop the bus a nearby resident was woken by a women shouting 'get off me'. Ms Coyne's body was later found in a foetal position in a passageway between two houses at nearby Thorneywood Mount, St Ann’s, Nottingham at 8.45am that morning. A post mortem showed Ms Coyne, of Top Valley, Nottingham, died from head injuries. A concrete lump thought to be the murder weapon was found next to her body. She had been gripped round the neck, shoulders and breasts. Defence wounds to her hands indicated she had fought for her life. Mr Rafferty said Ms Coyne, the mother of two boys aged seven and five, was killed because her killer lost his temper when she did not comply to his demands for sex. Scroll down for video . Plea for help: Ms Coyne was captured on a bus CCTV camera trying to wave it down just moments before she was allegedly killed by Carl Powell, 23 . The court heard Ms Coyne had spent the evening prior to her death drinking at a family birthday party at her mother’s house. Mr Rafferty said: 'She was the life and soul of the party, organising games for the guests,' adding that she was 'the worst for drink' when she left. Jurors heard that around an hour before Ms Coyne was attacked she flagged down two special constables and got into the back of their marked police car. She asked the officers for a lift home but they refused. Half an hour later she tried to flag down the bus. Powell, from Carlton, Nottingham, was arrested almost a month after Ms Coyne's death for a sex attack on another woman. Bus CCTV: The driver of the out-of-service bus was taking staff members home when he spotted Ms Coyne shortly after 1am . Dangerous: The driver claims he was forced to brake and swerve to prevent the bus from hitting Ms Coyne . The alleged victim - who can't be identified for legal reasons - claims she was walking home after a night out in Nottingham when Powell grabbed her by the throat and dragged her into college grounds and sexually assaulted her. Powell denies the attack. The court was told that Powell attacked his victims because he thought they would be easy targets because they had been drinking. Mr Rafferty told the jury: 'Last summer, in 2011, on dates a month apart, two women were stalked and attacked late at night when each was alone and when each, the prosecution say, were identified as a potential target and when they may have been the worse for drink making them vulnerable.' When questioned after his arrest Powell told police: 'I’ve no need to attack women because I can get them just like that.' Powell denies the murder of Ms Coyne on July 23, 2011, and denies false imprisonment with intent to commit a sexual offence and sexual assault of the 21-year-old woman on August 24 last year.

Pope Benedict's former butler stole thousands of highly sensitive documents the pontiff had marked 'to be destroyed' and compromised Vatican security through his actions, a court heard today. On the third day of Paolo Gabriele's trial, testimony depicted a man fascinated by the occult, Masonic lodges, secret services and past Italian and Vatican scandals. Stefano De Santis was one of four Vatican police officers who said they found the papers in the 46-year-old's home. On trial: The Pope's former butler Paolo Gabriele (right) sits in the wood-trimmed courtroom of the Vatican tribunal at an earlier hearing on Saturday. He is accused of stealing thousands of top secret papal documents . He told the Vatican courtroom: 'You can understand our unease when we saw these documents. This was a total violation of the privacy of the papal family.' Gabriele's leak to an Italian journalist of sensitive documents, some of them alleging corruption in the Vatican, caused one of the biggest crises of Pope Benedict's papacy. It threw an unflattering spotlight on the inner workings of a city-state eager to shake off a series of scandals involving sexual abuse of minors by clerics around the world and mismanagement at its bank. Gabriele, a trusted servant who served the pope meals, helped him dress and rode in the popemobile, has admitted passing papers to the journalist at secret meetings, but told the court at a previous hearing he did not see this as a crime. The former butler sat impassively and occasionally smiled during Wednesday's 75-minute session as Vatican policemen told the court how they searched his apartment in the Vatican on May 23, the night of his arrest, and what they found. The mass of incriminating documents, most of which were hidden in huge piles of papers stashed in a large wardrobe, included personal letters between the pope, cardinals and politicians on a variety of subjects. Close: Pope Benedict XVI and Gabiele (bottom left) with the pontiff's private secretary Georg Gaenswein in May . Some papers, De Santis said, bore the . pope's handwriting and had been marked 'to be destroyed' by the pontiff . in German. He did not say what those papers concerned. Some of the documents were copies of encrypted documents. De Santis told the court: 'One photocopy was enough to threaten the operations of the Holy See.' The agents said they found a mass of documents and books filled with newspaper clippings on the occult, secret services, Masonic lodges, yoga, political scandals in Italy, scandals involving the Vatican bank and other subjects. Defence lawyer Cristiana Arru sought to turn the spotlight on police methods during the search, drawing out several agents to say that they had not used gloves when they handled the documents, and a gold nugget and a cheque for 100,000 euros made out to the pope which were also found. Police said Gabriele, once one of fewer than ten people who had the key to an elevator leading to the private papal apartment, had printed instructions on how to hide files in computers and how to use mobile phones secretly. Police told the hearing that some of the papers bore the Pope's handwriting and had been marked 'to be destroyed' by the pontiff in German . Bishop Francesco Cavina, who knew Gabriele in the Vatican, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Wednesday that the butler, a father-of-three, may have a 'disturbed mind' and 'a split personality'. Two of the four policemen who testified on Wednesday also rejected Gabriele's accusations, made on Tuesday, that he was mistreated for several weeks after his arrest. Gabriele told the court's previous hearing that for up to 20 days he was held in a room so small he could not stretch out his arms and that the light was left on 24 hours a day, causing him eye damage.A Vatican judge ordered an investigation into the allegations. De Santis said the search turned up 'many more' papers than appeared in a book by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, who wrote a muckraking expose early in 2012. The letters to the pope included one in which a senior Vatican functionary expressed concern about corruption in the Holy See's business dealings with Italian companies. The letter-writer, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, was posted to Washington after raising the issue, despite begging to be allowed to stay at the papal state. The trial adjourned until Saturday, when a verdict is expected.","Paolo Gabriele admits leaking details of Church power struggles .

Tragic: Father of two George Falder, 48, was found dead inside a 150C industrial oven at the factory where he worked . A factory worker has been found dead in a 150°C industrial oven used to partially cook tyres. Father-of-two George Falder, 48, is believed to have 'died within seconds' after being overcome by the extreme heat when he entered the steam operated machine at a Pirelli tyre factory. An investigation has now been launched into his 'suspicious' death on Sunday evening and police are questioning his colleagues at the plant in Carlisle, Cumbria. A pathologist has carried out a post-mortem examination to see if Mr Falder had been assaulted before he died, but they found no signs of any physical injuries. The machine involved has also been tested and was found to be 'fit for purpose'. Today Cumbria Police appealed to Mr Falder’s colleagues and friends for information about what happened in the run-up the tragedy at 6pm on Sunday. Detective Chief Inspector Mike Forrester said: 'Mr Falder’s tragic death has deeply shocked and saddened all of his friends, family and colleagues - and our thoughts remain with them. 'Our priority is understanding whether this was a tragic accident or whether this was something more sinister and we are working alongside the Health and Safety Executive to establish why Mr Falder went into the machinery on Sunday evening so we can give his family the answers they desperately need. 'As part of our investigation to date we have spoken to many of his colleagues at the factory. 'We have specially trained officers who are supporting Mr Falder’s family and we are keeping them informed as our investigation progresses. 'They are deeply distressed and have urged the media to respect their privacy at this terrible time and leave them alone to come to terms with their loss.' An ambulance was called to the site at 6.23pm on Sunday. Mr Falder was treated by ambulance crews but was pronounced dead at the scene. Workplace: Mr Falder had worked at a Pirelli tyre factory in Carlisle, Cumbria, pictured, for nearly eight years . Mr Falder, who had worked at Pirelli for . almost eight years, was described as a 'quiet, family-orientated man'. He . was a keen cricketer who played as a batsman for local club. In . a statement, his family said: 'George was the kindest man you would ever . know. He would do anything for anyone. He had a heart of gold and he . will be missed so much by all of his family. 'George was happy spending time with his wife Andrea and two children, Emma and Simon, and loved walking pet dog Bailey. 'George . had just returned from his holiday in Turkey which he had been looking . forward to since he booked it. We are all glad he got to go before this . tragedy happened.' The . factory, which employs about 850 people and recently announced a £9million . upgrade, was closed on Monday. The Italian company supplies tyres for . Formula 1 racing cars among other vehicles, although the Cumbrian plant does not make them. A statement from the company said: 'Pirelli is deeply saddened to announce a death at its Carlisle site.

A small Nasa lander being tested for missions to the moon and other destinations beyond Earth crashed and burned after veering off course during a trial run at the Kennedy Space Center yesterday. There were no injuries after the prototype, known as Morpheus but dubbed 'the beetle', burst into flames near the runway formerly used by Nasa's space shuttles. The insect-like vehicle, designed and built by engineers at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, had made several flights attached to a crane before Thursday's attempted free-flight. Scroll down for video . NASA's experimental moon lander crashed and burst into flames seconds after takeoff due to a hardware fault . NASA's project Morpheus lander is seen bursting into flames during a test at Kennedy Space Center . Morpheus's engines, which burn liquid oxygen and methane, appeared to ignite as planned, lifting the 1,750-pound (794 kg) vehicle into the air. But a few seconds later, Morpheus rolled over on its side and plummeted to the ground. Nasa video showed the vehicle engulfed in flames and then rocked by a spectacular explosion, presumably due to the fuel tanks rupturing. 'Failures such as these were anticipated prior to the test, and are part of the development process for any complex spaceflight hardware,' Nasa said in a statement. An investigation is under way, the statement added. Project Morpheus began in partnership . with privately owned Armadillo Aerospace, which is developing re-usable, . suborbital vehicles that take off and land vertically. Nasa, which has spent about $7 million . on the project over the past two and a half years, is interested in developing . technologies that could be used to fly cargo to the moon and other . future missions beyond Earth orbit. The Kennedy Space Center was used up until recently for space shuttle launches . Project Morpheus was an example of what the former project manager called 'Home Depot engineering' - low-budget projects that use existing resources and partner with non-traditional aerospace companies. 'The Morpheus lander is kind of our poster child. It's one of our first attempts to do these kinds of projects,' former project manager Matt Ondler said in an interview with Reuters last year. 'Instead of building some elaborate test structure, you go to Home Depot and build something very quickly that gets you 80 percent of the answer and allows you to keep moving forward,' he said. The Kennedy Space Centre is symbolic to the world's biggest space agency . Morpheus arrived at Florida's seaside space center in July for three months of increasingly rigorous test flights, including automated landings in a mock moonscape, complete with craters and boulders. The lander was designed to deliver about 1,100 pounds (500kg) of cargo to the moon, Nasa said on its Project Morpheus website. Technologies being developed include a propulsion system that uses liquid oxygen and methane -- green fuels that could be manufactured on other planetary bodies, Nasa said. The accident happened as Nasa scientists were still hailing the Mars rover Curiosity's descent and landing on the Red Planet earlier this week as a 'miracle of engineering.'","Insect-like vehicle was due to fly cargo to the moon and beyond .

A floating robot has been deployed to track great white sharks in the Pacific as part of efforts to understand the giant predators. The 'wave glider', which from above looks like a yellow surfboard, picks up signals from tagged fish up to 1,000 feet away in the ocean and then sends their positions to researchers via a satellite transmitter. The location of sharks are relayed to researchers via a special iPad app, and they can also see maps and even video from the glider . Scientists have only a hazy . understanding of where great white sharks, portrayed as ferocious . killers in films like 'Jaws', swim in the oceans. The new robot will give insights into their movements, they say. 'Here we are in the 21st century and scientists have just put a rover on Mars,' said Barbara Block, a marine sciences professor at Stanford University in California in charge of the project. Researchers Dr.Barbara Block & Keith Kreide examine the waver rider robot, which can track nearby sharks and sent the results to an iPad . 'And we don't understand what is going on in the oceans,' 'We will send a wave glider out to follow the sharks.'

The glider, about 7 feet long with solar panels above and a wave-power system below, could also give clues to other tagged creatures ranging from mako sharks to tuna and salmon. It can only notice creatures that have been previously tagged by scientists with tiny battery-powered acoustic transmitters that bleep once every two minutes. Thousands of creatures carry the tags, Block said. The glider, and listening buoys in fixed positions chained to the seabed, are building on a previous project for the tagging of Pacific predators, which was part of an international census of marine life from 2000-10. Fixed bouys with solar panels are also used to listen for sharks . Block said that scientists already knew that great white sharks wandered across the Pacific from North America, often all the way to Hawaii. There were also mysterious gatherings, including in one mid-ocean area dubbed the 'white shark cafe'. Unlike the fixed buoys, the gliders can monitor such 'ocean wi-fi hotspots'. The researchers are setting up an app, 'Shark Net' allowing people to track the fish. Block hopes to extend the ocean observing network down the west coast of the United States, likening the region to a 'blue Serengeti' as rich in wildlife as Tanzania or Kenya.

Thermal cameras could one day pick drunk people out of a crowd, by monitoring the body temperature of various parts of their face. Scientists in Greece have published a paper detailing how two computer formulas, in conjunction with the camera, can spot physical differences, such as the dilation of blood vessels in a drunk's cheek, or the slight increase in heat on a drunk person's nose when compared with their forehead. The concept has been used before in airports to help spot people with infections, such as SARS, but the new twist on the technology could be used as sports events or crowded areas as an aid to security teams or police. Thermal spots: The new software developed in Greece can look at changes in body temperature to determine sobriety . Georgia Koukiou and Vassilis Anastassopoulos, from the University of Patras in Greece, have produced two algorithms to analyse data from cameras. They noted how alcohol causes blood vessel dilation at the skin's surface, so by comparing different spots on the face, they can spot individual pixel-width differences. A second program looks at heat variability across areas of the face, based on observations that the nose becomes relatively hot compared to a cooler forehead when a person is inebriated. Differences such as a warmer nose and inflamed blood vessels in the cheek can all indicate how much alcohol is in someone's system . The authors suggest the system could be used to stop the police or officials making mistakes based on ill-founded assumptions based on someone's appearance or behaviour. Or publicans or shops could use the technology to help them assess whether to serve customers. A similar technology was deployed outside St Paul's Cathedral by police during the Occupation protests earlier this year. However the technology is likely to raise concerns over privacy, particularly if deployed en masse on the general public.","Technology has been used before at airports to monitor for disease .

In fact, Apple has spent the weekend preparing San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Center for the grand launch, which will see CEO Tim Cook take to the stage to launch the first new iPhone since the death of Steve Jobs last October. Apple stays quiet before the launches, but eagle-eyed Apple fans have already looked for cryptic clues in the colourful banner draped outside the building - and they appear to have found one. For when fans started playing around with the shrink tools on Photoshop, they saw that the multi-coloured strips are apparently the iPhone's iconic deck of icons stretched upwards. Ready for launch: The Yerba Buena Centre in San Francisco has been given an Apple makeover - and the streaks of colour may give us a clue about the new iPhone . Considering the rumours flying around Apple's latest device, it is not just the conspiracy theorists who see this as a clue that the next iPhone will come with a bigger screen - for why else would the icons be stretched? The images are on the front of the Yerva Buena Centre, an apt location for Apple as it is often used for visual arts and media events. The cryptologists on the website MacRumours spotted how the banner took the form of Apple icons - in particular Game Centre, iTunes, and the Music and App Store - when you shrunk the image down. While sceptics might not see a hidden meaning in the image, it does appear a quite elongated and time-consuming process by Apple's PR team if it is one without purpose. Spot the pattern? The banner appears to show the Music icon, the Games Centre, a Music Centre, a Shares program, an unknown, and then, at the end, the Safari browser logo . Stretch to fit: Apple has finished decorating the front facade of the Yerba Buena center before the event on Wednesday . The iPhone 5 has been the subject of heated debate over the last six months. Apple keeps notoriously tight-lipped about products until they are ready for launch, and the vacuum has been filled by plenty of speculation. However, reliable leaks from within the Apple supply chain have given away some of what we are likely to expect. This includes a re-designed dock port for connecting to other devices - which may infuriate users of older models - and a larger four-inch screen. Apple's iconic headphones are also getting their first redesign since 2008, and the headphone socket has allegedly moved to the base of the device. Unconfirmed but rumoured additions include an NFC chip, which allows swipeless payments at the till, and, following Apple's acquisition of a company called AuthenTec, the possibility that 'swipe to unlock' will become reality with an in-built fingerprint scanner.","Online fans claim Apple has buried a clue to its 'stretched screen'

Maheshwor Dhakal, an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu, agreed that a group of the animals, which are common in the low mountain areas of Nepal, would cause even more bloodshed. He said: 'Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer'. He added that the actual death toll could be higher than 15, because there have been other animal attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India, which borders Baitadi district. Of the 15 victims in Nepal so far, two-thirds are children below the age of 10 and all are from small villages in the remote region. The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest. 'No adult male has been killed,' Kharel said. After killing its victim, the leopard drags the body away into the forest to eat. Leopards are common in Nepal, but most hunt wild and domestic animals . 'In the case of the children it just leaves behind the head, eating everything, but some parts of the adult body are left behind because it cannot finish it,' Kharel added. The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilised armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the leopard and has announced a $300 reward to anyone who captures or kills it.

The 22-foot-long 'Tyrannosaurus Rex of the Sea' has been unveiled by scientists, who discovered and researched the remains of two giant prehistoric crocodiles. The two crocodiles - Plesiosuchus and the 17-foot-long Dakosaurus - were top of the marine food chain as they explored the shallow waters which covered south England 150 million years ago. Dr Mark Young, of the University of Edinburgh, led an international team of scientists in exploring the remains, found buried in previously ocean-covered areas of Dorset and Cambridgeshire as well as in Germany. T-Rex of the sea: Plesiosuchus has a similar size and skull structure to the most fearsome of dinosaurs . Dakosaurus's skull and close-up of its teeth, used for hunting down prey in the shallow waters of south England . Rather than the more laid-back style of modern-day crocodiles, the research team say the collossal beasts hunted aggressively and territorially in a mammal-like manner. The team say that Dakosaurus and Plesiosuchus both had skulls more similar to Tyranodaurus rex and, in feeding manner, behaved much like North Atlantic killer whales. Young told Discovery News: 'The skulls of these two sea croc species have some similarities to T. rex. 'The largest known skull of Plesiosuchus manselii was . approximately four feet, three inches long, putting it in the size range . of adult T Rex skulls.' Young added: 'There are two ""types"" of North Atlantic killer whales: the first is large-bodied (more than 2m longer than the smaller type) and the teeth have no tooth wear, while the second is smaller-bodied and the teeth show extensive tooth wear. 'This is the same pattern we see in these fossil crocodiles.' Dakosaurus: The skull, mandible and snout is shown in the top image, followed by a close-up of the teeth, showing the interlocking dentition . He added: 'The fact that two unrelated groups, separated by around 152 million years evolved a similar set of morphofunctional adaptations in western Europe came as quite a surprise.' Dakosaurus and Plesiosuchus were part of a diverse group of marine . crocodylians in the family Metriorhynchids. They varied hugely in body . size, lifestyle and feeding strategy. The team, which included researchers from the Natural History Museum, also found that Dakosaurus had skull and jaw characteristics like living suction-feeding dolphins, which would make Dakosaurus the first known suction-feeding crocodylian. Young said: 'This way of eating involves being able to rapidly open the mouth wide, . and generating negative pressure. This sucks a prey item . into the mouth.' He added: 'This research shows that crocodiles are not ""living fossils"". To scale: The team has researched four giant crocodiles which lived in the European seas 150million years ago . 'The long fossil record of crocodiles show they did many of the things living mammals do today. 'There were some terrestrial crocodiles with mammal-like teeth and also crocodiles that left the land and became fully marine. 'They evolved some remarkable adaptations for marine life, from flippers to a shark-like tail fin.' Another question that has intrigued scientists is how such a large variety of top predators could live together side by side in the same ecosystem without competing with each other. Dr Lorna Steel, from the Natural History Museum, said: 'The skull and tooth morphology show that they all ate different prey, and fed in different ways. 'We think that Plesiosuchus specialised in eating other marine reptiles, and Dakosaurus was a generalist, probably eating fish and whatever else it could get hold of, perhaps including the small metriorhynchid Geosaurus.'","Crocodile roamed oceans which covered south England .

They may look like the trails of a motorcycle from the sci-fi film Tron, but in fact these are a far more pedestrian form of transport. Researchers at City University created the maps to show exactly where people using London's hugely popular cycle hire scheme travelled to. The maps, which show 5 million journeys, have since been used by transport for London to help them ensure enough bicycles are available for both tourists and commuters. Scroll down for video . The animation unfold to show 5 million journeys taken across London. The images reveal the routes around London users of the Barclays cycle hire scheme use. The maps reveal an average day in the life of the London bicycle hire scheme and were created by visualisation expert Professor Jo Wood at City University in London. He based it on data from the first 5 million journeys pedalled in the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme since its launch in July 2010. 'The data comes from TfL, and is publicly available,' he said. 'We were interested in seeing how we could show the behaviour of cyclists using the scheme. 'Because of the scale of the scheme traditional methods didn't work, and we wanted to make something visual.' The team used glowing purple lines to track the progress of riders over a day, revealing patterns as the amazing images are formed. The video tracks 5 million journeys taken by users of the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme in London. The top hire stations from last week were: . 1. Waterloo Station, Waterloo - 3,085 hires    2. Hop Exchange, The Borough - 2,131 hires3. Hyde Park Corner, Hyde Park - 2,098 hires    4. Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park - 2,086 hires    5. Belgrove Street, King's Cross - 2,048 hires . Source: TfL . 'The video is one example of the kind of visualisation we constructed - and it does show very clearly there are different behaviours. 'There are the Hyde Park leisure cyclist touring the parks, who were self contained within the park, creating a rectangle of colour in the the bottom right. 'In contrast there are also commuters showing patterns from the major stations as people pick up bikes at stations and cycle into Central London. 'We also found a third, more complex pattern in the City, where people are moving to Liverpoool street as well as from it during the day.; . although the team initially began creating the maps on their own, they have since started working with Transport for London, who run the scheme. 'Lots of tidal commuting behaviour can mean bikes need to be moved,' said Professor Wood. 'This is helpful in predicting where TfL need to move bikes, and at what time.' In the animation, the curve of a route indicates the most frequent direction of travel: trajectories leave a station in a straight line and then hook into their destination. Mayor of London Boris Johnson with bicycles used in scheme, dubbed 'Boris bikes' by many. researchers have now used the data from the journeys to create an incredible colourful map tracing cyclists routes. First launched in 2010, the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme has been used for over 16 million journeys. Dubbed 'Boris Bikes' after Mayor of . London Boris Johnson's enthusiasm for them, the bikes are accessed at . docking stations dotted around London. Tourists can use interactive touchscreen stations at each docking point to book cycles, while regular commuters can get special 'keys' allowing to to simply take bikes whenever they want. Transport for London use the maps to reveal patterns, and work out which stations need to have bikes manually added or removed to keep the system running. Some have likened the maps to the trails left by 'light cycles' in the sci fi film Tron.","Incredible images map 5 million journeys taken by users of London's bicycle hire scheme .

However, EE has managed to circumvent this process because it found sufficient spare spectrum on its existing 3G mast network to launch 4G now.

The decision has given EE, which owns . the Orange and T-Mobile brands and has some 27million customers, an . advantage over rivals. And Vodafone claimed consumers would lose out because EE would effectively have a monopoly. It said: ‘We are shocked that Ofcom has reached this decision. ‘The regulator has shown a careless disregard for the best interests of consumers, businesses and the wider economy through its refusal to properly regard the competitive distortion.’ But EE hailed Ofcom’s decision as ‘great news for the UK’.

Apple is in the final stages of purchasing a fingerprint security firm - meaning future iPhones are likely to have an extra layer of built-in security. There are even suggestions that the new iPhone - due to be unveiled on Wednesday - will already have a fingerprint scanner built in, stopping anyone from reading your messages and data without your fingerprint authorisation. If AuthenTec agrees to the $365m (£228m) purchase by Apple on October 4, it will be one of the largest sums paid in a takeover by the tech giant. Other than the purchase of a 'flash memory' supplier last year, this is believed to be Apple's biggest acquisition since the pre-iPod days of 1997, showing how serious Apple is about the technology. Swipe to unlock: Apple's purchase of AuthenTec suggests that future iPhones can be secured by fingerprint technology . Apple is also unveiling a new service . called PassBook, which allows users to store shop coupons, loyalty . cards and other items such as airport boarding passes, with the release of iOS6 - the sixth-generation of its iPhone software - this autumn. Airlines . in the U.S., such as United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines . and Virgin Australia will all allow Apple users to store their . documents on their phone, meaning a quick swipe will get you to the . boarding gates. AuthentTec creates mobile phone security and, according to the merger documents, has already been developing 2D fingerprint sensors for Apple. The technology could see a fingerprint . scanner built behind the screen, requiring your thumbprint to unlock the . phone, or it could be a sensor on the back of the device, across which . you roll your thumb to allow access. Technology writer Matt Brian, for the site My Next Web, said: 'Will we see fingerprint technology in the new iPhone, or iPad? It . seems almost certain. 'Details are scarce but [Apple's] desire to use the technology and see . it developed quickly leads us to speculate that we could see it in just a . matter of weeks.' If Apple comes with NFC, which allows . contactless authorisation or payments, it could make the iPhone a . wallet-replacements, allowing secure payments for small orders. Airline scan: Apple's PassBook will allow passengers of some airlines to check in using their smartphone . The . technology is similar to that seen on some bank cards, or with the . London Underground's Oystercard system, allowing you to swipe to enter . the Tube network. However, not everyone agreed that the iPhone 5 will come with either finger-print scanners or NFC technology built-in. Blogger Sonny Dickson, inspecting images of the insides of the iPhone 5, said the internals do not match the rumours. Previous looks at the internals revealed a mysterious square that seemed an appropriate candidate for an NFC chip. But Dickson said the square may simply hold the front-facing FaceTime camera, proximity sensor and a speaker. He said: 'The latest leaked pictures appear to show that there is indeed no NFC . chip or fingerprint scanner included in what appears to be the complete . front assembly. 'Apple may well be keeping these . features under lock and key until their announcement on September 12th'. He added that an NFC chip and a fingerprint scanner would make 'perfect sense', but added: 'Looking at Apple and . their incremental iPhone updates it may be too big an update in too . short an amount of time.' Either way, if NFC does not come to the iPhone this time round, it cannot be far away.

NASA has undertaken the task of mapping the pattern of volcanic heat on the surface of Jovian moon Io. The heat pouring out of Io's hundreds of erupting volcanoes - the most volcanic place in the known solar system - indicates a previously unknown complex, multi-layer source, scientists found. The data, collected by both NASA's Voyager and Galileo spacecraft and ground-based telescopes, left researchers surprised at it disposes of  the generally-accepted model of internal heating. It was collated to build a map of hot spots, illustrating the amount of heat being emitted, that shows the global distribution and wide range of volcanic activity on Io. Most of Io's eruptions dwarf their contemporaries on Earth. Mapping Io's hot spots: Nasa has collated data to analyse the heat pouring out of the Jovian moon's volcanoes - the larger the spot, the larger the thermal emission . Researcher Ashley Davies, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, added: 'The fascinating thing about the . distribution of the heat flow is that it is not in keeping with the . current preferred model of tidal heating of Io at relatively shallow . depths. 'Instead, the main thermal emission occurs about . 40 degrees eastward of its expected positions.' His colleague Dennis Matson added: 'The . pattern that emerges points to a complex heating process within Io. What we see indicates a mixture of both deep and shallow . heating.' A mystery has also emerged - the team . found that active volcanoes accounted for only about 60 per cent of . Io's heat, mostly emanating from flat-floored volcanic craters called . paterae, a common feature on Io. Scientists are still trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the 'missing' 40 per cent.

A man battered his pet cat with an iron bar after it jumped on him and sunk its claws into his back in a 'wildlife programme'-style attack, a court has been told. Simon Land beat the cat with a 3ft-long bar after the animal mauled him as he tried to move it from his bedroom. The three-year-old animal's injuries were so severe that vets had to put her down. After the attack, Land, 43, called 999 in a desperate bid to save the ginger-and-white cat Mia. Despite RSPCA inspectors racing the animal to a vet in a shopping trolley to get her emergency treatment, she had to be put to sleep, a court was told. Land was arrested and, during an appearance at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court yesterday, he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. He was banned from keeping animals for five years and ordered to pay £250 in court costs. Land suffered scratches as a result of being attacked by Mia, magistrates said. Charles Overton, chairman of the bench, told Land: 'The aggravating factor is the cat died as a result of a weapon.' Land, who had bought the cat from a woman on the internet, revealed how the cat had attacked him at his home in Congleton, Cheshire, on the night of January 24. He told the court he knew Mia was a 'problem cat' but was determined to look after her. He claimed he found Mia behind his wardrobe and tried to remove her from his bedroom because it was a cold night and he wanted to close the door. Beyond rescue: The horrific injury Simon Land inflicted on his pet cat Mia when he hit her with an iron bar . During a hearing at Macclesfield Magistrates Court (pictured), Land was banned from keeping animals for five years . Andrew Meachin, prosecuting, said: 'He said he went to get her out and she went into a frenzy. 'She was jumping all over him and he couldn’t get her off him. 'He said he had only seen something like that in wildlife programmes.' After beating the cat off, Land took a shower before dialling 999 and begging the police for help. Mr Meachin added: 'Land stated that he had just got out of the shower as he had been covered in blood and he had called the police as he didn’t know what to do. 'No reasonable person would pick up a metal bar and hit a cat - there is no justification' 'When asked what had happened he stated that his cat, Mia, had attacked him and, to get her off, he hit her with an iron bar. 'When asked where Mia was, he pointed to underneath the settee. 'The officers saw a small, white and ginger cat cowering underneath and it was clear the cat had a severe injury to its right eye, which was very swollen and blood-red.' Despite desperate attempts to save the cat, a vet put her to sleep after ruling her injuries were too severe. Julian Farley, defending, told the court Land acted in self defence. He said: 'It was an extremely difficult cat. I’m not saying he should have done what he did, but it was a very difficult cat to handle. 'He expressed his remorse but nevertheless, we are where we are.' After the case, RSPCA inspector Lisa Lupson said: 'No reasonable person would pick up a metal bar and hit a cat - there is no justification.'

Belgian researchers watched videos of women walking, and were able to tell whether they regularly had orgasms from intercourse. At the Universiti Catholique de Louvain, Institut d'itudes de la famille et de la sexualiti, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, they set about proving the theory right. They took women with known histories . of either vaginal orgasm or inability to orgasm from sex and videotaped . them walking on the street, and their orgasmic status was judged by . sexologists blind to their history. ‘In the sample of healthy young . Belgian women, half of whom were vaginally orgasmic, history of vaginal . orgasm that was triggered solely by penile-vaginal intercourse, was . diagnosable at far better than chance. The researchers think that, as well as having an effect on people's mental health, orgasms can 'loosen' muscle groups. They wrote: ‘Research has demonstrated the association between vaginal orgasm and better mental health. Some theories of psychotherapy assert a link between muscle blocks and disturbances of both character and sexual function. In Functional-Sexological therapy, one focus of treatment is amelioration of voluntary movement. 'The present study examines the association of general everyday body movement with history of vaginal orgasm.’ The team said the objective was to determine if appropriately trained sexologists could infer women's history of vaginal orgasm from observing only their gait. The walk of a woman who has had orgasms, but not from intercourse with a man is visibly different . ‘Clitoral orgasm history was unrelated to both ratings and to vaginal orgasm history. Exploratory analyses suggest that greater pelvic and vertebral rotation and stride length might be characteristic of the gait of women who have experienced vaginal orgasm. ‘The discerning observer may infer women's experience of vaginal orgasm from a gait that comprises fluidity, energy, sensuality, freedom, and absence of both flaccid and locked muscles. 'Results are discussed with regard to previous research on gait, the effect of the musculature on sexual function, the special nature of vaginal orgasm, and implications for sexual therapy.’","Woman who have orgasms from sexual intercourse walk differently .

Kim and Kris walk down the aisle on their big day, but some . sources are claiming the whole thing was merely a money-making exercise . However, sources close to Kim and Kris said their relationship was 'pretty much an arranged marriage right from the start'. Upset: A ringless Kim at LAX yesterday . The source added to Radaronline.com: 'Kim was looking for a husband and Kris . was selected for her, amongst others. 'She wasn't really into him but she . hoped she would be able to develop some feelings, but it never . happened. 'Kris turned out to not be as malleable as everyone hoped he would be, he was pictured out partying with other girls, Kim really couldn't care less for him, she decided to end it.' In a further twist, Kim filed for divorce a year to the day she very first set eyes on Kris. The reality star met Kris on October 31, 2010, at a New Jersey Nets game. Kim was sat courtside at the Izod Center in New Jersey when she took a liking to strapping 6ft9in-tall Kris. The couple began dating just weeks later, leading to a whirlwind marriage - and yesterday's news of divorce. Meanwhile, as Kim announced the end of the marriage, the inevitable questions began to arise about how much money the pair made from their union. Kim's decision to file papers against . Kris just hours before her mother's book, Kris Jenner and All Things . Kardashian, goes on sale tomorrow, could certainly be viewed as a . calculated move. And yesterday, as soon as she woke up, . Kim promoted the family's new clothes store on Twitter, only later being . drawn upon for a statement about the breakdown of her marriage. Full circle: Kim filed for divorce a year to the day she first set eyes on Kris as he played in a New Jersey Nets match in New Jersey on October 31, 2010 . Still wearing the bling: Kim, with sisters Khloe and Kourtney, had her engagement and wedding rings in place on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last night . In a tweet that many of her fans will find cold and inappropriate, she effused: 'Our store #KardashianKhaos is opening . tomorrow at 9am at @TheMirageLV We are so excited!! Kardashian Khaos has . arrived!” Kardashian Khaos indeed…' It's a miscalculation of tone that Kim might live to regret, as fans begin to question the reality behind her family's money-spinning soap opera. Whatever the truth, there is no doubting the fact that 31-year-old Kim's marriage has been lucrative for the Kardashian family. Was it ever love? This is the moment when fans wept to see Kim find happiness, but now they doubt it . And for that matter, the abandoned spouse, Kris Humphries, 26. The wedding, which would've cost the couple $10 million if they'd had to pay for their freebies, netted a whopping $18 million. A huge chunk of that - around $15 million - is thought to have been TV rights which formed part of the family's exclusive deal with E! Whatever the exact breakdown, their marriage ending now means that the whole haul has earned the couple about $250,000 per day. Involvement: Loyal viewers bought into Kris and Kim's courtship so it's demise could affect the whole franchise . The happy couple also bagged $1 million from People magazine for exclusive shots of the apparently joyous occasion. That's not to include the value of the numerous other magazine covers that have added grist to the mill of the Kardashian publicity machine. Even before the big day, Kim was paid $500,000 to host her bachelorette party at Tao in Las Vegas. But then, however heartbroken he is, Kris has benefitted hugely. He was earning around $40,000 per game but since marrying Kim, has been hitting the quarter of a million mark each day. This is sure to be a loss he feels keenly. The gravy train: Khloe, Kourtney and Kim promote the Kardashian Kollection in Cerritos, California last month . Especially as Kim seems determined to sever ties sharply and swiftly. E! report that alongside the prenuptial agreement she put in place, the brunette wants property separated immediately, and for each party to pay their own legal fees. She listed 'miscellaneous jewellery and other personal . effects' as well as 'earrings and accumulations' amassed before, . during and after her marriage to be confirmed as separate property but no word . on whether that includes her $2 million, 20.5-carat diamond ring. It's a businesslike approach that's typical of the Kardashian model. Momager: Kris Jenner is the driving force behind the Kardashian empire . After Kim started the day with her advert for their latest enterprise, Kris Jenner waded in with her own promo, for both QVC AND her book. She wrote on her Twitter: 'How fab is . this sequin top I'll be selling at QVC tonight??! Just like the one I'm . wearing on my memoir cover!!!' Meanwhile Kourtney changed the subject with: 'Happy Halloween! I am ready for costumes and trick or treating!' Their incongruous tweets stood out in the tidal wave of commentary on the showbiz story of the day. One fan who tweets as Bookgirl96 summed . up the prevailing mood when she wrote: 'The Kim Kardashian definition of . 'forever' is 'when the check is cashed.' It was referring to the tellingly . passionless statement that Kim eventually released: 'I hope everyone . understands this was not an easy decision. I had hoped this marriage was . forever but sometimes things don't work out as planned. We remain . friends and wish each other the best.' The network's urge to protect their golden goose's integrity is understandable. Four million viewers watched the original wedding special, and 900,000 are estimated to have tuned into each repeat. Birthday girl: Kim even celebrated her 31st birthday last month with Kris in New York . But the Kardashians appeal rests upon . their viewers feeling that they are allowed an honest, almost . voyeuristic, glimpse into this gilded world. If fans believe their emotional connection is being exploited, it's likely they'll turn off in their droves. The . machinations of 'momager' Kris Jenner are well documented but if it's . starting to look like the hapless Kris was co-opted into her plans . purely because he plays basketball and has the initial 'K,' her . matriarchal bossiness could be viewed as calculated exploitation. So with Kim and Kourtney Take New York . premiering on November 27, in which the short-lived romance will be . documented, Kim needs to convince her pay-masters that there were hearts . in her almond eyes at one point, and not just dollar signs. The end: Kris and Kim were grim-faced after a meal on Thursday night, this was the last time they were seen together . Celebrities and VIPs took to Twitter in their droves in the wake of news Kim was filing for divorce from Kris. While some were sympathetic, the . reaction was largely cynical, with hashtags . 'thingslongerthanKimsmarriage', 'REASONSYOURSINGLE', and 'DIVORCE' among . the topics trending on Twitter. CNN talk show host Piers Morgan - who has interviewed Kim in the past - retweeted: . 'Kim Kardashian sold the rights to her wedding for $17.9 million. Her . marriage lasted 72 days. That comes to a nifty $10,358.80 per hour.' Late Show with David Letterman writer Justin Stangel weighed in: 'Wow -- @KimKardashian getting divorced. I'm shocked! Reality show weddings usually last.' Some of Humphries' fellow NBA player mocked the divorce too. Houston Rockets' player Terrence Williams tweeted: 'You can't make fake love work not even money.... It's just TV entertainment smh.' Samantha Ronson, whose ex-girlfriend Lindsay Lohan was a guest at the wedding, exclaimed: 'Wait, so it was actually a real wedding?' Musician Questlove was thinking along the same lines: 'Wait, Kim Kardashian got married?' Gossip blogger Perez Hilton . was seemingly angered that Kim had apparently made a mockery of her . right to marriage. He wrote: 'I love @KimKardashian, but as a gay man in . America who is treated as a second class citizen when it comes to civil . marriage, I am offended!' There were a few supporters out there, however. Kelly Osbourne tweeted: '@KimKardashian thinking of you stay strong don't listen to the haters . listen to your heart! Xoxo.' And music mogul Russell Simmons also offered some kind sentiments: 'Hoping the best for Kim'",Kim filed for divorce a year to the day she first met Kris at New Jersey Nets match .

Virgin Airlines has announced that the customer that accumulates the most frequent flier points over the next year will be rewarded with a free trip to space. Mr Branson's space tourism company Virgin Galactic is working on providing would-be astronauts with sub-orbital flights to just outside of the earth's atmosphere - with a price tag of $200,000. Now frequent users of Virgin Airlines are being given the chance to upgrade to 'Galactic' status, with the customer who builds up the most points between now and August 7 2013 winning a free flight on board Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. The runner-up will be treated to a free zero-gravity flight aboard a modified aeroplane on earth. Over 500 people have paid deposits to secure a place on a $200,000 trip aboard SpaceShipTwo. Virgin Galactic - billed as the world's first commercial 'spaceline' - has carried out successful test flights using SpaceShipTwo, but it is yet to fly any tourists into space. The refundable deposits to reserve a spot on board the spaceship start at $20,000. The craft, which is designed to carry six passengers, is launched midair from another 'carrier' aeroplane. The Federal Aviation Administration has given Virgin the green light to test SpaceShipTwo in 'powered flight' by the end of the year. It has already successfully completed 'gliding' tests.

A natural drug discovered in the soil of Easter Island could improve the memory of older people - and even treat Alzheimer's, researchers say. In tests in mice, the drug halted the decline in brain function as they got older, and offered hope that it could also treat depression. The drug - rapamycin - is a bacterial by-product discovered in the shadows of the island's famous statues. It is named after Rapa Nui, the Polynesian name for Easter Island, which sits isolated in the Pacific ocean - 2000 miles from anywhere. Easter Island heads: It is named after Rapa Nui, the Polynesian name for Easter Island, which sits isolated in the Pacific ocean - 2000 miles from anywhere . A natural drug discovered in the soil of Easter Island could improve memory in older people - and even treat Alzheimer's, researchers say . It is already used in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection and now scientists in journal Neuroscience say it can improve learning and help treat cognitive decline. It could even treat conditions like Alzheimer's, they believe. A team from the University of Texas added the drug to the diet of healthy mice and discovered it improved learning and memory in young mice and memory in elder rodents. Professor Veronica Galvan said: ‘We made the young ones learn, and remember what they learned, better than what is normal. ‘Among the older mice, the ones fed with a diet including rapamycin actually showed an improvement, negating the normal decline that you see in these functions with age.’ The team also found three ‘happy, feel-good’ neurotransmitters - serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine - were higher in the mice treated with rapamycin. The drug - rapamycin - is a bacterial by-product discovered in the shadows of the island's famous statues . This could help explain the effects on memory, she said, and helped back up previous research which showed Alzheimer's like syndromes were lowered in mice treated with the drug. ‘This is super-interesting and something we are going to pursue in the lab,’ she said. It also lowered anxiety and depressive-like behaviour in the mice, she said.Her colleague Dr Jonathan Halloran used a series of elevated tunnels that led to a catwalk to examine the behaviour of the rodents. Mice prefer tunnels to open spaces and were watched on the catwalk. Dr Halloran said: ‘All of a sudden the mice are in open space.‘It's pretty far from the floor for their size, sort of like if a person is hiking and suddenly the trail gets steep. It's pretty far down and not so comfortable.’Mice with less anxiety were more curious to explore the catwalk, he said. He explained: ‘We observed that the mice fed with a diet containing rapamycin spent significantly more time out in the open arms of the catwalk than the animals fed with a regular diet.’ Similarly, when mice were handled by their tails they would struggle, but depressed mice would struggle less. ‘So we can measure how much and how often they struggle as a measure of the motivation they have to get out of an uncomfortable situation,’ said Dr Galvan. ‘We found rapamycin acts like an antidepressant - it increases the time the mice are trying to get out of the situation. ‘They don't give up; they struggle more.’","In tests on mice, the drug reverses decline caused by ageing .

Celebrities, organizations and brands all vie for fans to show their support by clicking the Like button on the social networking website. But Facebook admitted on Friday that the Likes of a particular page might not necessarily reflect actual Facebook fans since marketers have increasingly circumvented the website's policies and have been offering Likes for purchase, to bulk up numbers. To like or not to like: Facebook is giving a thumbs down to third party services that allow users to buy Likes in bulk, to boost the appearance of a page's popularity . New Facebook security measures will work to make it more difficult for third parties to deceptively garners Likes. 'A Like that doesn't come from someone truly interested in connecting with a Page benefits no one,' the company explained in a posting by their security team entitled 'Improvements To Our Site Integrity Systems.' 'When a Page and fan connect on Facebook, we want to ensure that connection involves a real person.' 'We have recently increased our automated efforts to remove Likes on Pages that may have been gained by means that violate our Facebook Terms,' the announcement added. Dislike: Some investors are wearying of Facebook's inability to monetize its service, leaving Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the hot seat . The changes will likely mean a subtraction of about one per cent of the Likes on any given page. Facebook maintained that it never . sanctioned any of the rampant services available to purchase Likes and . warned Page owners to be wary of marketing services that offer to build a . brand's presence on the website. Facebook's announcement seemed to be well received by users -- the posting garnered over 700 Likes in the first few hours. The admission that all Likes on a page may not be legitimate comes as Mark Zuckerberg's empire . struggles to prove it can monetize its popular web presence.

When life becomes a struggle against a common enemy, it is hopefully a time when warring factions can unite and reconcile their differences. Perhaps this is the reason for a startling new co-operative friendship between two factions of dolphins, who before have not even bothered to share a tuna snack between them. The two bottlenose dolphin populations, living in the clear waters of Moreton Bay near Brisbane in Eastern Australia, have rarely interacted - but when fishing boats stopped using the bay, the dolphins got together to forage. Friends reunited: The bottlenose dolphins of Moreton bay are now co-operating on the food forage (file picture) Tranquil coast: Moreton Bay, near Brisbane in Eastern Australia, is home to two tribes of dolphin - now merged into one group . One of the dolphin groups would feed almost entirely on the off-casts from trawler boats, while the other tribe would hunt fish for themselves. In what was called 'the parting of the pods', the dolphins would never associate. But with fishing reduced in the area by around 50 per cent, the dophins 're-engineered' their relationships. Speaking to BBC Nature, Dr Ina Ansmann, marine vertebrate ecologist for the . University of Queensland, said: 'There's never been really any experiments looking at social . structure... where you can compare what it was like before and what it . is like now. Social behaviour: The dolphins became friends again in Moreton Bay, near Brisbane .

'When relying on natural food sources I guess it's more important for . them to interact with others, or to learn from others, or to co-operate . with others to get to these food sources. 'Presumably they're sharing information, co-operating and things like that.' The scientists can tell individual dolphins apart from markings on their dorsal fin - usually scars or notches - and could follow individual dolphins as they moved between packs. The behaviour of the divided animals was first noted in the 1990s, but now they hunt together - and perhaps one dolphin was the peace-broker, as he has is now 'fully integrated' with the other pack.","Two groups in Brisbane join forces to hunt for food .

Google Fiber includes such features as the ability to record eight TV . shows at a time and store up to 500 hours of high definition . programming. Users can choose to use a tablet or smartphone as a . voice-activated remote control. Google is offering its Nexus 7 tablet with the Google TV app to early users of the service. Google said it is setting up a 6-week ‘rally’ for consumers to vote on . where the first fiber communities, or ‘fiberhoods,’ should be installed . in the Kansas City area. Consumers must pay $10 to register their household online for service. About 50 ‘neighbors’ will need to register in order for their area to be . eligible for installation services, according to Google executives. Whether or not consumers will embrace the new offerings remains to be . seen. But officials said they are confident Kansas City will be a . showcase of success for a larger rollout. ‘Google is a very different company,’ said Kevin Lo, general manager of Google Access. ‘And this is not a short-term project.’ ‘Access is the next frontier that needs to be opened,’ Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said. ‘We're going to do it profitably. That is our plan.’ ‘We are at a crossroad,’ he added, noting that Internet speeds had leveled out for broadband since around 2000. ‘We at Google we believe there is no need to wait.’ Google Fiber's ultra high-speed connections and television offerings are aimed at surpassing those of current providers, allowing users to search live channels, Netflix, YouTube, recorded shows and tens of thousands of hours of on-demand programming. However, no phone service is available. ‘The phone is really a 1940s thing. Why have a landline? It's sitting there, you use it once every two weeks,’ Pichette said. Google said it also intends to roll out product packages for businesses, but would not provide details. Google Fiber includes more than 100 networks and costs $120 a month for a package of TV, 1 gigabit per second Internet speeds and 1 terabyte of cloud storage. The package includes popular networks owned by major media companies such as Comcast Corp's NBC Universal, Discovery Communications and Viacom Inc. Premium movie networks are available from Liberty Media's Starz for an extra fee. Google's promotional video for Fiber outlines the search giant's plan to bring ultra-fast internet to cities across America . Google has unveiled its own ultra-high-speed internet service - offering lightning-fast speeds of one gigabit per second in Kansas, Missouri . But it excludes several major TV names, such as News Corp's Fox cable channels; Time Warner networks like CNN, TNT and TBS, as well as Walt Disney Co cable channels like ESPN and Disney children networks. Google executives said the company is still in negotiations to add more content. ‘They need to be able to offer something that is everything people have now and more,’ said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research. ‘People are going to have high expectations for this. The worst thing they can do is come out and disappoint.’ Google is also offering an Internet-only package priced at $70 a month. The download speeds would be around 1 gigabit a second, according to Google executives. Google is charging a $300 installation fee, saying consumers should treat it as a ‘home improvement’ cost. The initial service area includes central Kansas City, Missouri and all of the city of neighboring Kansas City, Kansas. This market is dominated by Time Warner Cable Inc, which charges $99.95 for its fastest Internet-only service there. Google Fiber would be 20 times faster.

Jackie Powell has denied the allegations surrounding her departure from a mental health charity earlier this year . The confidante of Moors murderer Ian Brady quit her job at a respected charity following allegations she posed as a nurse to obtain prescription drugs for her partner. Jackie Powell, who has acted as a mental health advocate for Brady since 1999, is at the centre of controversy after being arrested over claims she had a letter written by Brady in her possession that could identify the location of his victim Keith Bennett, whose body has never been found. Now it has emerged Ms Powell, 49, was suspended by mental health charity Eiriol, based in South Wales, last year and was subject to a disciplinary hearing into her ‘inappropriate conduct’. She left Eiriol in January. Paul Betteridge, who until recently was chair of trustees at Eiriol, said Ms Powell was investigated by the charity over allegations she posed as a community psychiatric nurse at a GP practice in a bid to persuade doctors to give her drugs for her partner. He said the charity was also informed of allegations that she pretended to be a nurse at a police station where her partner was in custody, to persuade officers to allow her to visit him. Mr Betteridge said: ‘I heard that she [Powell] had acted inappropriately and that she was suspended with a view to the investigation. 'There had been a couple of complaints about her.’ Asked if Ms Powell had visited a GP to try to obtain drugs, Mr Betteridge said: ‘From two GPs, in fact. One in Swansea and one in Birmingham.’ Ms Powell, a human rights and criminology graduate, had worked at Eiriol as a mental health advocate since 2007. The role involves helping people with mental-health issues to defend their rights and express their views. Ms Powell was arrested two weeks ago on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body following her participation in a Channel 4 documentary, Endgames Of A Psychopath, which was screened last week. On camera, Ms Powell said Brady had given her a sealed envelope to be opened after his death, which would ‘allow [Keith’s mother] Winnie Johnson to find peace’. She speculated that the contents might reveal the location of 12-year-old Keith’s body on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham. Channel 4 sources said producers urged Ms Powell to hand her letter to the police, but she went ‘off radar’ for a few days. Ms Powell told Channel 4 documentary makers that she had a sealed envelope from Brady which would allow Winnie Johnson, mother of Keith Bennett, right, 'to find peace' When she made contact again, she told them she had returned the letter to Brady, 74, at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Merseyside. Documentary producer Paddy Wivell contacted the police, who raided Ms Powell’s home in Llangennech, near Llanelli. Mrs Johnson died last weekend after dedicating her life to finding where Brady and Myra Hindley buried her son, who vanished in 1964. Winnie Johnson, pictured here on Saddleworth Moor, died last weekend, the day after claims surrounding Ian Brady's letter emerged. She never knew where her son's body was buried . Lynn Howells, manager at Eiriol, said: ‘All I’m allowed to tell you is as of January this year she [Powell] was no longer working for Eiriol.’ A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said the force was unable to comment. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police, which is investigating Ms Powell over the letter, said officers were not aware of the allegations. Last night, Ms Powell denied there was any truth to the allegations but refused to comment further.","Ian Brady's mental health advocate quit her charity job in January after allegations she posed as a nurse to get prescription drugs for her partner .

Divers say they have found a ship off the coast of Italy which they believe is about 2,000 years old. The ship, which was spotted in the sea off the town on Varazze in the province of Liguria, is thought to be a Roman-era commercial vessel. Scroll down for video . Divers examine one of an estimated 200 pots found on a shipwreck off the coast of Italy. The pots are so well preserved food still remains inside them. The ship, a navis oneraria, or merchant vessel, was located at a depth of about 200 feet after a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was used to scour the seabed. A search for the shipwreck was launched after local fisherman revealed they kept finding pieces of pottery in their nets. The divers found the wreck so well preserved even the food, still sealed in over 200 pots, is intact. 'The peculiarity of this is that the wreck could be almost intact,' Lt Col Francesco Schilardi of the police divers' group told the BBC. 'We believe it dates to sometime between the 1st Century BC and the 1st Century AD.' The ship was found to be carrying over 200 pots containing food. Initial tests have found pickled fish, which was often used to create a sauce called garum. Garum was a popular staple of menus for wealthly Romans, made from fermented fish and served as a side dish to meals. It was created by placing fatty fish such as sardines along with fish guts and blood into a large container with herbs and layers of salt. The container was then left in the sun for several days, before being mixed ever day for around 20 days, until it became a liquid. Other foodstuffs found in the pots include wine, oil and grain. The team has so far been unable to find the name of the ship, but it was believed to be a sailed vessel used to carry commercial goods. The ship would have been travelling between Italy and Spain, a popular shipping route, and would have been carrying food to sell at its destination. Roman ships were commonly named after gods, mythological heroes or concepts such as harmony, peace and victory. Researchers believe the mud on the seabed protected the wreck. Test on some of the recovered jars revealed they contained pickled fish, grain, wine and oil. The foodstuffs were traded in Spain for other goods. The containers found in the wreck are known as amphora, and are a unique shape, often containing handles. The large containers were commonly used to transport large quantities of food and wine, and were able to hold both solid and liquid. The examples found in the latest wreck were ceramic, but they were also made in metal. Italian police bring ashore a pot recovered from the 2,000 year old wreck. they have now banned other divers from visiting it to protect the site. 'There are some broken jars around the wreck, but we believe that most of the amphorae inside the ship are still sealed and food filled,"" said Lt. Col. Schilardi. It is hoped that further tests on the foodstuffs could give an insight into Roman lifestyles. The ship is thought to have travelled on trade routes between Spain and what is now central Italy and was loaded with more than 200 clay amphorae likely to have contained fish, wine, oil and grain. Police divers used a robotic diver to explore the wreck before descending themselves. Here, a robotic hand is seen reaching out for a pot. The ship, which dates to sometime between the 1st Century B.C. and the 1st Century A.D., is hidden under layers of mud on the seabed, which has left the wreck and its cargo intact. The vessel will remain hidden at the bottom of the sea until Italian authorities decide whether to raise it or not, and police have placed an exclusion zone around it to protect it from other divers.

Researchers from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt have revealed one of the oddest spiders ever discovered. The Sinopoda scurion is the first eyeless huntsman spider in the world. Sinopoda scurion, a unique spider with no eyes that was found in a cave in Laos. Scientists believed it developed after living in caves with no daylight. With a leg span of only six centimetres and a body size of around twelve millimetres, the spider Sinopoda scurion is certainly not one of the largest representatives of the huntsman spiders, which include more than 1100 species. However, it is the first of its kind in the world without any eyes. 'I found the spider in a cave in Laos, around 100 kilometres away from the famous Xe Bang Fai cave,' said Peter Jäger, head of the arachnology section at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt. 'We already knew of spiders of this genus from other caves, but they always had eyes and complete pigmentation. 'Sinopoda scurion is the first huntsman spider without eyes.' The accompanying study has been published by the scientific journal Zootaxa. The team believe the regression of the eyes is attributable to living permanently without daylight. This adaptation was also observed in other cave-dwelling spider species by the Frankfurt arachnologist. 'The Sinopoda species described demonstrate all kinds of transitions to cave adaptation – from eight functioning eyes to forms with six, four and two lenses, right up to blind spiders,' said Jäger.The spiders are in good company: fish, scorpions and crabs that have adapted to caves have already been found in the caves of Laos. The spider has a body around 12mm long, and a legspan of 6cm . In total, the Frankfurt spider researchers have described nine new species of the genus Sinopoda. The fact that all of the species have been found in caves confirms the animals’ preference for underground habitats. Because of the small-scale area in which the spider species can be found it is possible to study their adjustment to the cave as a dwelling – the number of eyes present and the visual faculty may possibly shed light on the time of settlement. 'Furthermore, the spiders can be used as indicators for the threat to their habitats,' said Jäger. 'These are often endangered by tourism or the exploitation of the limestone rocks to make cement.' The eyeless huntsman spider was named after the Swiss company “Scurion” that makes headlamps for caves.","Tiny spider believed to have evolved in cave near Laos .

Stanford University scientists have developed a self-driving robotic race car that can hit 120mph on the test track. The white Audi TTS was put through its paces on the Thunderhill Raceway, north of Sacramento, California. The autonomous car raced round the three mile course in two and a half minutes, a time that rivals those posted by professional drivers. The affectionately named Shelley is the . result of a collaboration between Stanford's Dynamic Design Lab, led by . mechanical engineering design graduate Chris Gerdes, and the Volkswagen . Electronics Research Lab. Scroll down for video . Shelley was named after Michele Mouton, the first woman to win the race up Pikes Peak in the Rocky Mountains . The team hopes to use the same technology that helps Shelley navigate around corners to develop collision avoidance systems for normal cars . Shelley navigates the course with the help of an assortment of algorithms. The . software that tells Shelley when to brake, how tight to turn, and when . to push the pedal to the metal, was tested by Gerdes at Thunderhill. The researchers claim the route Shelley takes is nearly the same as the one a professional racing driver would take. The Audi TTS is kitted out with antennas and sensors to help it navigate around the track . However, despite the autonomous car's sophisticated technology, it still can't quite compete with human-driven equivalents. 'Human drivers are very, very smooth,' said Gerdes. Shelley computes the fastest line around a course and executes the exact corrections required to stick to it. A . person relies more on feel and intuition, and thus may, for example, . allow the car to swing too wide in one turn if he knows it sets him up . better for the next. 'Human drivers are ok with the car operating in a comfortable range of states,' said Gerdes. 'We're trying to capture some of that spirit.' Gerdes . and his students will have the opportunity to do just that this weekend . at the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion races at the Laguna Seca . Raceway. The group has enlisted two professional drivers to wear a suite of biological sensors as they race around the track. Graduate research team leader Chris Gerdes shows off the systems carried onboard the autonomous car, a modified Audi TTS . The sensors will record variables such as the driver's body temperature and heart rate. Scalp . electrodes will be used to register the driver's brain activity as they . race against other humans to determine which driving maneuvers require . the most concentration and brainpower. The . biological data will be paired with mechanical performance data from . the car – a 1966 Ford GT40, the only American-built automobile to finish . first overall at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race – which Stanford has . kitted out with feedback sensors similar to those on Shelley. 'We need to know what the best drivers do that makes them so successful,' said Gerdes. 'If we can pair that with the vehicle dynamics data, we can better use the car's capabilities.' The team believes that the experience and the data they have gained can be used to develop autonomous vehicles for use on public roads. In the nearer term, the technology could be used as an onboard co-pilot that helps the driver steer out of a dangerous situation. The reality of racing a car round a track and pushing that vehicle to its absolute limit means that it will be subjected to exceptionally high levels of stress. The recent tests left poor Shelley without any brake pads due to the intense heat generated by friction between the tyres and the pads themselves. Pushing a car to the limit on the racetrack is one of the best ways to find out what type of stress that car is under in a crisis. 'If we can figure out how to get Shelley out of trouble on a race track, we can get out of trouble on ice,' said Gerdes.","Driverless Audi TTS hit speeds of 120mph, rivalling professional drivers .

Bill Moggridge, the British industrial designer who designed the early portable computer with the flip-open shape that is common today, has died. The Grid, his first deign, was the blueprint for laptops still in use today. The Grid Compass cost $8,150 in 1982 . Processor: Intel 8086 processor . Screen: 320 × 240-pixel yellow and black display . Memory: 340-kilobyte magnetic bubble memory . Communications: 1,200 bit/s modem . Moggridge is credited with the design of the Grid Compass, a computer that had a keyboard and yellow-on-black display that sold for $8,150 when it was released in 1982. It was encased in magnesium and seen as rugged, and was used by the U.S. military. The computer made its way into outer space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1985. Although there were many portable computers being developed around that time, Grid Systems Corp. won the patent for the clamshell design with the foldable screen hinged toward the back of the machine, said Alex Bochannek, a curator at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. Moggridge pushed for this foldable design when it was realized the flat-panel screen, keyboard and circuitry could all fit snugly together. Moggridge, who was 69, died on Saturday, Sept. 8, 2012 from cancer. 'In terms of the industrial design of the enclosure, Moggridge was instrumental in proposing that,' Bochannek said. 'He came up with that particular form factor.' Until that point, portable computers resembled portable sewing machines that weighed more than 20 pounds and had a big handle, he said. It was after using the machine that Moggridge’s ideas about design began to change, Bochannek said. His work began to focus more on how people interacted with devices, rather than just making sure they were enclosed well. A co-founder of design consultancy firm IDEO, Moggridge authored the books 'Designing Interactions,' which was published in 2006, and 'Designing Media,' published in 2010. 'Beloved by the museum staff and the design community at large, Bill touched the lives of so many through his wise council, boundary-pushing ideas and cheerful camaraderie,' said Caroline Baumann, associate director of the museum, in a statement.

Iran's top military commander yesterday said ‘nothing will remain’ of Israel if it took military action against the Islamic republic’s controversial nuclear programme. General Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the Revolutionary Guard, also warned that if attacked, Iran would close the strategic Strait of Hormuz and hit US bases in the Middle East. Such warnings, and references to . Israel’s destruction, have frequently been made by Iranian officials . however the General gave an unusually detailed, strongly worded and . comprehensive description on how Tehran would retaliate against a strike . on its nuclear facilities. Warning: General Mohammad Ali Jafari, left, and Benjamin Netanyahu, right, who said Iran is dangerously close to acquiring an atomic weapon . He said: ‘Our response to Israel is clear: I . think nothing will remain of Israel should it attack Iran. Given . Israel’s small land area and its vulnerability to a massive volume of . Iran’s missiles, I don’t think any spot in Israel will remain safe.' He said Iran’s response to any attack . will begin near the Israeli border. Iran has close ties with militant . forces in Gaza and Lebanon, both of whom have stockpiled rocket arsenals . that could be used for strikes against the Jewish state. Jafari said he did not believe however . that Israel would attack on its own. Should the U.S. launch a strike, . he claimed that Iran could respond with missile bombardments directed at . U.S. bases in the Gulf. He added: ‘The US military bases sprawled around . Iran are considered a big vulnerability. 'Even the missile shields that . they have set up, based on information we have, could only work for a . few missiles but when exposed to a massive volume of missiles, the . shields will lose their efficiency and will not work.' The U.S. and Israel have left open the possibility of such a strike if Iran does not back down from what they say are a push to develop nuclear weapons. In recent days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran is dangerously close to acquiring an atomic weapon. On Sunday, the Israeli premier renewed his call for the U.S. to set ‘red lines’ on Iran’s nuclear program. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. 'Nothing will remain': Israel would be wiped out if it took military action against Iran's controversial nuclear programme, it was claimed . America’s ambassador to the United Nations said yesterday that there is ‘no daylight’ between the U.S. and Israel when it comes to stopping Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. But Susan Rice also says U.S.-Israeli intelligence indicates that the two nations have ‘considerable time’ before that happens. Rice says President Barack Obama has been clear that it stands with Israel and ‘will do what it takes’ to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. But she added ‘we are not at that stage yet.’ Jafari also said that Iran warned that oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz will be in danger if a war breaks out between Iran and the U.S. Iran has previously threatened to close the waterway between the Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf, which is the route for a fifth of the world’s oil. He said: ‘If a war breaks out where one side is Iran and the other side is the West and U.S., it’s natural that a problem should occur in the Strait of Hormuz. Export of energy will be harmed. It’s natural that this will happen.' Jafari’s comments come as U.S. and naval forces from the West and Arab allies, from more than 27 countries and four different continents, gather in the Straits for the largest ever military exercise aimed at practicing how to find and destroy sea mines in the waters of the Middle East.","General Mohammad Ali Jafari, also warned that if attacked, Iran would close the .

Yet for a man with a wife and two mistresses, this may seem an unusual lament. For decades, Britain’s best-loved modern poet was torn between his love for three women – his faithful wife, Penelope; long-term mistress Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, a childhood friend of the Queen; and Margie Geddes, who was revealed to have been his lover only after she died in 2006. Romance: More than 100 letters and postcards were sent by former Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, right, to his secret lover Margie Geddes, left . On display: After being stored under a bed for decades, the private, passionate thoughts of Sir John Betjeman are to go on show to the public for the first time. Some of the letters are pictured . Now, almost 30 years since the Poet . Laureate’s death, details of their secret affair have been revealed for . the first time following the emergence of more than 100 love letters Mrs . Geddes had kept hidden under her bed. The deeply touching notes show the . intensity of Betjeman’s ardour during their liaison, where he writes of . their ‘delicious and wonderful evenings’ together. In one he says: ‘Darling Margie, I . fear you are bound to haunt my mind for the rest of my life. I like this . haunting. I feel I can rest in you and depend on you.’ In another, he writes: ‘I long to be . in your arms and comforted and able to talk to you for hours alone... It . is very selfish of me to demand so much of you in sympathy and warmth . but as you have both I must rest in them.’ A young John Betjeman and one of the letters he wrote to Mrs Geddes in 1964 . In a note sent in October 1970, he . asks when his lover is free to have lunch with him, adding: ‘I long and . ache to see you. Love Jo.B.’ Even before his marriage, Betjeman had . a reputation as a ladies’ man and had been engaged three times. But it . was not until the death of Mrs Geddes, aged 98, that it emerged the . mother of two was not only a friend but his lover. The affair was revealed by her son Andrew, who said it was her wish that, once she was gone, the world should learn the truth. Affair: The letters show Sir John had a four-year affair with Mrs Geddes in the 1970s while he was married to Penelope, pictured . They met in 1929 at a sports day at . Heddon Court prep school in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, where Betjeman . was a 22-year-old English master. She was 20 and had gone to see her two . younger brothers compete. She wrote of this first encounter: . ‘Quite suddenly in a flash I was aware that this was no ordinary person, . but someone very special. No, it wasn’t love, it was just an awareness . of potential greatness.’ Rare: The museum will not just feature the love letters but also other forms of the poet's work . Unique: This picture shows another of Betjeman's original works which will be displayed from October . Sir John Betjeman is one of the most popular British Poet Laureates and was also a much-loved television personality. He was born in north London in August 1906 and eventually attended Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford. He started his career as a journalist but continued to write poetry. In 1931 he had his first book of poems, called Mount Zion, published. His prolific writing continued throughout the 1930s and 40s. By the 1950s, he was a well-known figure across the country, often making television and radio appearances. He was knighted in 1969 and made Poet Laureate in 1972. He died on May 19, 1984. But within three years the . relationship had ended after she learned of his marriage to Penelope . Chetwode, the daughter of a former commander-in-chief of the Indian . army. Later, Margie married Alexander Geddes and had two children, . although by the time she met her ‘Betje’ again in 1960 her marriage had . ended. They became lovers after she invited . him to a literary speaking engagement in Jersey. At this time he was . having an affair with Lady Elizabeth, the daughter of the tenth Duke of . Devonshire and lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret. Mrs Geddes once said: ‘He was a highly . sexed man, practically to his death’, but added: ‘To be with John B was . to enter another world – a more scintillating world, with the freshness . of a child’s outlook, where everything is a discovery, nothing taken . for granted, things seen not with the sight but with his vision and . enhanced by his imagination.’ The letters, the last of which was . sent two years before Betjeman’s death in 1984, will be on show from . October 27 at Tom Brown’s School Museum in Uffington, Oxfordshire, where . the poet once lived. Despite his affairs, Betjeman and his . wife were married for 53 years and had two children, Paul and Candida. Candida has helped transcribe the love letters. Poet: Sir John Betjeman first met Mrs Geddes when he was in his 20s . Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!It isn't fit for humans now,There isn't grass to graze a cow.Swarm over, Death! Come, bombs and blow to smithereensThose air -conditioned, bright canteens,Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans,Tinned minds, tinned breath.

President Obama will be a huge financial winner even if he loses the election - and could make  millions of dollars in book deals and public appearances. The 44th President of the United States could earn a fortune on the lecture circuit if he was forced to leave the White House, according to political experts. The lucrative template was set by former president Richard Nixon . who earned a fortune on leaving the Oval Office, even though he was forced to quit . in disgrace over the Watergate affair. Scroll down for video . Call me! Barack Obama, pictured at a campaign office in Chicago today, could earn millions of dollars even if he is not re-elected . Every president since, including George W Bush, has worked their contacts and experience for the benefit of their bank balance. Larry Sabato, a respected political scientist at the University of Virginia, said: ‘You never have to worry about an ex-president eating. Being a former president is a ticket to printing money. That’s all it is. ‘When we elect someone president, we nearly guarantee he will become a one-hundred millionaire.’ If Obama loses the election, he will likely return to his $2million red-brick, Georgian Revival home in a middle-class neighborhood on Chicago's South Side along with wife Michelle and daughters, Malia, 14, and 11-year-old Sasha. Drumming up support: Obama sits alongside volunteers and makes calls at a field office on election day . Show of support: Political analysts expect that Obama would earn millions of dollars in book deals and public appearances even if he doesn't win the election . A huge cash windfall would probably be the first time in his life that he would have some serious money. Earlier this year, Obama admitted that it took him 13 years to pay off his student debt and finally cleared his decks in 2004. In the same year, the Obamas reported an income of $207,647 - the kind of money he could make from just one speech. In 2005, he became Illinois state senator, earning $162,100 a year, while Michelle was the breadwinner on $316,962 for handling community affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center. According to Fox Business, Obama could follow the example of Clinton who has had the most successful post-presidency of all time - at least when it comes to making money. He left office in 2001 with huge legal debts from the Lewinsky sex scandal but last year alone raked in $13.4million in speaking fees. If the shoe fits: Obama autographs a sneaker while leaving a Chicago campaign office on polling day as the race to the White House reaches its final stage . Clinton earned a $15million advance for his 2004 autobiography My Life and can command up to $750,000 for a single appearance, which is nearly twice the President’s annual salary of $400,000. According to CNN, Clinton has pulled in $89million from speeches alone. In one speaking engagement, Clinton himself joked: ‘I never had any money until I got out of the White House, you know, but I've done reasonably well since then’. Made: Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, pictured outside a polling station in Belmont, Massachusetts today, is already a millionaire many times over . Obama could also follow the example of Nixon who paid off his $1million legal fees after Watergate with the $2million he earned from his memoirs in 1978. He also worked with British TV host Sir David Frost for the famous series of interviews which went on to inspire the film Frost/Nixon. Nixon was paid $600,000 and a slice of the profits -  $2.29million. Sabato said: ‘He [Nixon] resigned in disgrace. Yet he made money hand-over-fist between interviews, books and lectures.' Nixon’s successor Gerald Ford followed his example and joined the boards of businesses including Commercial Credit and Tesoro Petroleum. Ronald Reagan was paid $2million to make a speech in Japan after he left the White House. According to the Center for Public Integrity, George W Bush coined in $15million for 140 speeches in the three years after he left the White House. Ron Bonjean, a partner at PR firm Singer Bonjean Strategies in D.C., said the presidency was a ‘huge windfall’. He said: ‘If President Obama were to leave office I don’t think he’d be part of the middle class. He’d be part of the 1 per cent.' In the race: Mitt Romney and wife Ann leave a polling station in Massachusetts today .","President could eclipse his White House salary on the lecture circuit .

"By . Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 3 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:37 EST, 3 November 2012 . Prisoners have been given telephones inside their cells despite ministers promising to crack down on perks behind bars. Convicts at a young offender institution in Kent have become the first in state-run jails to be given personal landlines that they buy credit to use at any time of day or night. They can only ring numbers approved by the authorities and cannot receive calls on the handsets, while the cost of installing them is being covered by BT. Talk time: Prisoners across the country could have access to a phone in their cell if a new pilot scheme is successful . If the pilot scheme is deemed a success it could be copied in public sector prisons across England and Wales, having been used for several years in privately run institutions. But it is taking place at the same time as the new Justice Secretary, Chris Grayling, has vowed to stop prisoners spending all day in their cells watching television or playing video games. Unions also fear that governors are putting phones in cells in order to reduce the amount of time that criminals spend on landings or communal areas, allowing them to reduce the number of guards required. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “Greater use of IT could transform prison education, resettlement and family contact but as a complement to, not a substitute for, good professional staffing. “No one wants Big Brother hi-tech prisons with everyone held behind their doors and no human interaction.” The deputy general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, Harry Fletcher, said: “There must be safeguards that these phones are not used to contact, harass or intimidate victims. The same goes for drug dealing and organised crime.” Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to stop prisoners spending all day in their cells . However he added that the move may reduce the number of mobile phones being smuggled into prisons. Until recently inmates had to queue up to use phones on prison landings if they wanted to speak to friends or family, prompting a black market in mobiles brought in by visitors. Many jails now allocate time slots for individual prisoners, who must give details of who they want to call, to use the public handsets. But some newly built jails run by private firms have started to feature phones inside cells, and now HMYOI Rochester has become the first state-run prison to install them. In the pilot scheme, selected cells on two wings have been fitted with telephones at the Victorian institution, which is currently home to about 600 men aged between 18 and 21 who have been sentenced to up to four years behind bars. Under the BT system, they must set up a personal account that is accessed by a PIN and give the authorities the names, addresses and phone numbers of the people they wish to call so a list can be approved. The calls are monitored and recorded by the authorities, and inmates are warned against saying anything linked to crime, escape plans, threats or coded messages. Prisoners must buy credit to use the BT Pinphones and calls to landlines cost 9p a minute but ringing a mobile costs 20p a minute. There is no limit to how many calls they can make. Inmates can also have televisions in their cells for £1 a week while those given “enhanced” status for good behaviour are allowed PlayStation consoles from home and can sleep on their own bedding. Last month the prisons watchdog, Nick Hardwick, said too many prisoners were “lying on their backs in their cells watching daytime telly” because of a lack of money and staff to give them useful activities. But some of the in-cell perks could be scrapped as ministers try to stop prisons being seen as “holiday camps”. A law is being passed that will allow jamming devices to block mobile phone signals in jails, while access to satellite TV channels could be removed. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: “Ministers are reviewing the policy around the incentives scheme for prisoners. It is crucial that these incentives are appropriately earned and that they have credibility with the public. “A pilot scheme has been running at HMYOI Rochester which gives prisoners limited access to phones in their cells. In cell phones are subject to the same security controls that apply to phones on the communal landings, no prisoner can receive calls on this system. “This pilot will be evaluated and the results considered along with the other benefits associated with the incentives scheme.”","The cost of the pilot scheme is being paid for by BT .

Joe had been waiting by the school gates to be collected from Dorcan Academy in Swindon when he was suddenly hit by a lightning bolt around 3pm on September 26 during Britain's worst storm in 30 years. Medics at Bristol’s Frenchay Hospital, have given Joe a series of skin grafts and will fit him with a special body . suit next month to aid his recovery. Lucky to be alive: Schoolboy Joe Compton lying in hospital recovering the day he was struck by lightning at his school gates on September 26 . First aiders came to the rescue of .

I can’t really remember anything that happened that day or even waking . up in the hospital but I know I had detention after school so I was a . little bit late coming out. 'I don’t remember the pain at the time or afterwards because I blacked out.' It will be at least two years before Joe can expose his skin to direct sunlight. His family have thanked medics who . battled to save the Year 7 student’s life, as well as members of the . public who offered support following the incident. Upon . his release from hospital, Joe was also invited to Swindon Town FC’s .

'But because of what happened and the state that he was in, I was told to think the worst, but he surprised the doctors.' She also thanked first aiders who rushed to help Joe after he was hit by lightning. Stuart Arthur, 37, who was standing in . the reception at Dorcan Recreation Centre when the storm hit, arrived . first on the scene to administer CPR. Lucky 1: Joe Compton with his Swindon Town FC shirt . Speaking at the time, he said: 'I . heard a horrendous crack and there was a bright white light - I knew . then that something was wrong.

'We assessed whether he was breathing and it was apparent that he was not so I started CPR. 'While . I was performing CPR we got no immediate response but we were not . really expecting any, you don't tend to get a response straight away.' Mr Arthur continued CPR while other staff members ushered on cars and comforted Joe's sister, who had witnessed the incident. His . colleague Stephanie Woodman, 38, who was also in reception when the . bolt struck, grabbed a defibrillator and rushed to help. The assistant manager said: 'We heard this amazing sound and just as a lightning bolt struck, it sounded like a big explosion.

'Then I just saw him lay on the floor and I began to clean him up and put on the defibrillator.'

Tesco is launching a ‘drive-through’ service to boost sales and try to reverse its first profit fall for nearly two decades. Shoppers using ‘click and collect’ will buy online and then pick up their purchases from one of 150 designated stores. Britain’s biggest and richest retailer is also looking to sell some of its vast Extra supermarkets and rent out space in others in an admission it has expanded too far, too fast. Sales have slumped for the supermarket, despite the investment plan . The moves come as group profits fell 11.6 per cent to £1.66billion for the six months to September compared to last year – the first profit reversal in 18 years. The chain, which has 3,000 UK outlets, is being hit by a squeeze by rivals as well as cutbacks by shoppers. However, there was a glimmer of  optimism with the news of a rise in UK sales of 0.1 per cent over the last three months compared to a year ago. This still lags behind Sainsbury’s, which yesterday revealed a 1.9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales for a comparable period. Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive, says 'there is much more to be done' to improve the customer experience . Tesco chief executive Phil Clarke, commenting on the future of the Extra stores, said: ‘We could see disposals – that may happen. We could downsize them, repurpose them to focus more on food than clothing or rent out space.’ The grocery giant has seen sales in the UK hit a brick wall for the past 18 months. It has already shrunk some of its retail space by allowing third parties, such as the restaurant chain Nandos, to open in its shops. Tesco has suffered a squeeze from budget chains like Aldi, Lidl and Iceland on one side and Sainsbury’s and Waitrose on the other. Consumers struggling in the downturn are also economising in a trend hitting other chains like Asda, Morrisons and the Co-op. Tesco’s woes come after years of growth when it expanded to every corner of the land. It overtook Sainsbury’s to become the country’s biggest supermarket in 1995. Tesco has embarked on a £1billion turnaround plan which includes bombarding homes with money-off vouchers and its new ‘drive-through’ service. Shoppers will pay a £2 fee for this but it frees them from having to wait in for deliveries and means Tesco does not have to pay for a fleet of vans and drivers. The chain has also relaunched its cheapest Value range as Everyday Value. Sales of these budget lines have risen 10 per cent as a result.

It seems Blackberry’s impending revamp is too little too late to save the aging platform’s exclusivity deal with the Pentagon. The Pentagon wants to establish a ‘multi-vendor environment’ while still adhering to ‘strict security requirements’, spokesman Lieutenant Damien Pickart told News24. The move comes just days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it had bought $2.1 million worth of iPhones as Blackberry’s current platform just isn’t on the cutting edge anymore. The Pentagon (pictured) has decided to establish a multi-vendor environment costing Blackberry millions in exclusivity deals as the aging platform loses customers to next generation smartphones . Losing exclusivity with civil servants is a trend Blackberry has been weathering for a while. In February the General Services Administration announced it would expand support to iOS and Android in February, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it would switch off Blackberry servers that same month. When Blackberry was at the peak of its popularity, the reliable email and security were considered exceptional draws but now those features are common on competing phones. The iPhone’s iOS security and its manufacturers were advantages which attracted the Immigration Department over the Android with a range of hardware supplied by unknown manufacturers. Blackberry is betting everything on a revamp next year to win back millions of customers who have abandoned the device . Other major losses for Blackberry include US government consultant Booz Allen which announced its 25,000 staffers would no longer use the handsets and Yahoo’s decision last month that staff could have any device except a Blackberry. The Canadian firm behind Blackberry, RIM, says it still has at least a million users in the U.S government. The company is betting heavily on its six smartphone model releases in 2013 to win back the millions of users who have moved on to iPhones and Androids.","Move comes days after announcement saying platform is not cutting edge .

Jayden Lee Green, who was just a month short of his second birthday, was found dead in his parents’ bed after overdosing on the heroin substitute in August last year. The toddler, who was given the drug to sedate him, lived with his crack cocaine and heroin-addicted parents Jamie Green and Sonia Britton in a filthy flat in the St Georges area of Bristol.

Tragic: Jayden Lee with his mother Sonia Britton who bought her son up with partner Jamie Green in a filthy . flat in the St Georges area of Bristol. He was just a month short of his second birthday when he was found dead . Before his birth there were . concerns that Britton was regularly injecting heroin while also taking . methadone during the pregnancy. Following his birth he became subject of a child protection plan but that was discontinued. A second child protection plan was commenced but moves to take Jayden Lee into care were never initiated, the review said. During . this time Green and Britton continued to use heroin and methadone and . were also were falsifying regular urine tests. They pair later admitted . they 'knew the tricks to get around screening'. The report also found that there was a lack of co-operation from Jayden Lee’s parents with all involved in dealing with them. This included drug agencies, midwifery, housing, health visitors, social workers and there were also regular failures to keep appointments or be at home when visits were made. The report stated: 'What was lacking was the authoritative challenge to this lack of co-operation, there was a lack of enforcement of consequences. There was a lack of challenge by practitioners across the range of agencies.' The report, which referred to Jayden Lee as 'Child K' throughout, continued: 'The extent of the parents’ lack of engagement, avoidance and dishonesty grew over time and although this was recognised by practitioners there was insufficient challenge by professional and no sustained, planned approach to protecting the child. Failures: Jayden Lee pictured with his father Jamie Green. The report into his death stated that the extent of the parents’ lack of engagement, avoidance and dishonesty grew over time but professionals didn't challenge this . 'The only way that Child K’s death would definitely have been prevented was if he had been placed away from his parents. 'The opportunity to do this was lost due to the failure to follow through on the initiation of care proceedings. However, a better-planned and authoritative approach to the family may also have prevented his death.' It was revealed today that Jayden Lee suffered two head injuries - one at seven weeks and one at 11 weeks - and his parents gave the same explanation. The report stated that this should have raised concerns that the injuries were not accidental. The . boy also sustained injuries to his face at 21 and 23 months old and . again the same explanations were given when he was seen by medical . professionals.

During the trial the court heard that several different agencies were monitoring Green and Britton in caring for their son but they were able to pull the wool over their eyes. 'Sonia Britton and Jamie Green were aware that health care professionals, drug workers as well as social services were monitoring their behaviour as well as trying to help them,' prosecutor William Mousley QC told jurors. 'They created an image with those professionals that they were looking after Jayden Lee. Of course nobody knew they were giving methadone to Jayden Lee. 'While both of them cared about Jayden Lee, he was not their priority. They were drug addicts, whose need for drugs came before Jayden Lee.' Death: The report said that Jayden Lee's parents created an image with . professionals that they were looking after him but no one . knew they were giving him methadone. It said their need for drugs came before him . Prof Jones also called on the Government to publish guidance on the testing of children for methadone.

A couple have told of their horror after discovering an earwig inside a sealed bag of bread rolls picked up on their weekly supermarket shop. Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches. 'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said. Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed . The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them. An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects. Ms Naisbett and her partner Mr MacPhail, a 47-year-old council worker, said they bought the rolls fresh on Monday and put them straight into their freezer when they got home. After removing them to defrost on Wednesday the couple say they found the earwig lurking inside the bag. Disgust: Gary MacPhail and Jane Naisbett, seen with the bread rolls, say they will be taking their business elsewhere . Mr MacPhail said: 'Jane lifted out the pack of rolls to make some sandwiches and when they had defrosted there was earwig inside the bag. 'The bag is still completely sealed, there's no way it could have got in there,' he added. Mr MacPhail claims he was offered a £5 voucher after taking the rolls back to Asda - although the store insists he was offered a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture. His partner said she would be taking her business elsewhere. 'I've shopped there for over 20 years,' Ms Naisbett said. 'But I won't be setting foot in there again.' An Asda spokesman said: 'The quality of our products is our number one priority and we take any customer complaints incredibly seriously. 'We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened and unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to look at this product or investigate it properly.

Most people have a few operations in their lifetimes, but brave Lila Ruiz is about to have her fortieth - and she's just four years old. The adorable Tampa toddler was struck down with a mystery illness when she was just eight months old. Since then, doctors across multiple states have been battling to diagnose her debilitating condition, which affects the major muscles controlling her organs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fighter: Brave four-year-old Lila Ruiz, pictured left and right, is about to have her fortieth surgery as she battles a rare, unnamed disease . 'She struggles every day with a very, very, very rare disease,' her mother, Maghann Ruiz, told CBS News, adding that Lila is the only person known to have the ailment, which remains unnamed. 'The disease is so rare, they can't really tell us what the future holds, or what tomorrow holds, if this is her last surgery, or if there's more in the future. They don't know,' said Ms Ruiz, confused and heartbroken. A happy, healthy baby, Lila picked up a strange bug at her Tampa daycare in 2009. '(She) just never got better,' Ms Ruiz said.

The panicked family began traveling to Texas, where Lila could be treated by doctors they trusted at Children's Medical Center. 'We've been in Dallas a lot!' said Ms Ruiz, who has a second, younger daughter, Stella. The Ronald McDonald House near the hospital has become their second home, putting them up for weeks at a time as Lila, brave-faced, underwent surgery after surgery over the past two years.

The BBC said the number of complaints ‘will fluctuate both up and down as new allegations are made and investigated’. It is not yet known whether any complaints are linked to Jimmy Savile. Mounting problems: The total of 29 past and present employees is more than triple the figure given by BBC director-general George Entwistle in evidence to MPs two weeks ago of nine people under investigation . ‘Once they (the allegations) have been investigated - either resulting in further action or the matter being cleared and resolved - the cases will be closed,’ a BBC spokesman told the Sunday Times. The rising figures come after the national broadcaster launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of the late TV and radio presenter's alleged sexual abuse. Savile, who died last year aged 84, is believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims. Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into his activities. A Slater & Gordon solicitor told the Sunday Times that more than 30 potential Savile victims have come to the firm - and their claims range from when they were aged just seven up to adulthood.

IF you’re always striving to reach impossible standards your parents are probably to blame. The pursuit of perfection runs in families and is determined by your genes, claim scientists. A study suggests that rather than becoming perfectionists, people are born to it. Runs in the family: Gwyneth Paltrow has said she is a perfectionist, just like her actress mother Blythe Danner . Researchers at Michigan State University made the link by studying the twin registry and comparing the personalities of identical and non-identical female twins aged 12 to 22. Identical twins have the same genetic make-up so if a personality trait is determined by nurture alone, they should be just as likely as non-identical twins to share it. However, one study in the Depression and Anxiety journal, found identical twins had much closer scores on measures of perfectionism and anxiety than non-identical twins. This indicated that perfectionism is determined more by nature than nurture and can be attributed to a person’s parents. Gwyneth Paltrow is one famous actress who has confessed to being a perfectionist. She said: ‘One of my most negative qualities is the perfectionism that I have. I think that I unconsciously project that because it comes from self-doubt and insecurity and that’s the ironic part. ‘I’m so deeply flawed. I’m just a normal mother with the same struggles as any other mother who’s trying to do everything at once and trying to be a wife and maintain a relationship.’ Her parents Bruce, a television and film producer, and Blythe Danner, an actress, are also likely to have been perfectionists judging by their success. Perfectionist: Actress Emma Watson does not do things by half . Emma Watson, a successful actress who also did well academically, admitted she was a ‘perfectionist’ - a trait no doubt shared by her successful lawyer parents. She said: ‘I’m not a worrier, but I’m a perfectionist. The thing is feeling like I didn’t do the best job I could have. ‘I will always be able to find something wrong, something I can do better. My parents say I’m always looking ahead, thinking about what’s in front of me.’ Mary Berry, a judge on The Great British Bake Off and a bestselling writer of more than 70 cookery books, said that her daughter had inherited her perfectionism. ‘I strive for excellence in the Bake Off without any doubt,’ she said. ‘I think I used to be even more of a perfectionist. But if I’m laying a table, even for supper, I want it to look special. My standards are high. ‘I feel I’ve done my job properly if it is done well. If I open a kitchen drawer, I want everything to be methodical and tidy.’ She said her daughter Annabel, with whom she launched a range of sauces and dressings in 1994, had inherited her pursuit of perfection. Victoria Pendleton, winner of two Olympic cycling gold medals, often describes herself as a perfectionist like her father Max, a former national grass track cycling champion. Andy Murray’s dedication to perfection, which helped him win the US Open and an Olympic gold medal, is comparable to his mother Judy’s determination. Mrs Murray, a former professional player and coach, still irons her son’s shirts and once jumped on a plane to take him the correct shoes. No mistakes: Tennis star Andy Murray's mother Judy famously jumped on a plane to get him the correct shoes . Dr Jason Moser, who led the study, said: ‘We found there is a strong genetic component to perfectionism and the association between perfectionism and anxiety. ‘There is also a significant contribution from the unique environment of the individual outside the home. ‘But we didn’t find evidence that the shared home environment had much to do with perfectionism.’ The study showed that a lack of perfectionism - being slapdash or impulsive - also has a strong genetic component. A second study of 340 twins, published in the Journal of Eating Disorders, looked at the extent to which girls and women accepted the idea that thin bodies were more attractive. It found that identical twins were more alike than non-identical twins in how much they idolised the bodies of skinny celebrities - a sign that they are also more likely to be perfectionists.","Perfectionists are born - not made - scientists claim .

In fact, John Bottomley has got the world’s . most iconic celebrities licked after he created portraits of them - using only postage stamps. The . 64-year old former butler has produced pictures of Michael Jackson, . Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Liza Minnelli by sticking used first . and second class stamps onto a canvas. The . avid stamp collector has also made up a special 2012 Olympic tribute to . a local sports club also made entirely out of stamps. Each picture . takes John around 30 hours to complete and needs about 1,500 stamps - . around £700 worth if bought new. First-class: Jack Bottomley works on his Marilyn Monroe portrait. Some of his works can take more than 30 hours to make . Father-of-one John, from Clayton, . Manchester, who cares full time for his wife said: 'I must have a million . stamps, I’ve got albums full and as I love artwork it just seemed to . make sense to use old stamps to create pictures. 'But . when I get orders for my work I do wonder whether I should cheekily ask . the Royal Mail for free postage - because of all the stamps I use. 'I’ve not made any money from it, it’s just cost me a lot of time and my own money, but it is a love. 'I . was collecting stamps back with my brother back in the 60s; the first . was probably just a normal postage stamp, I would have cut it off and . started to collect them. 'The first one I did was Elvis, it was a challenge straight through, I think it took me about thirty hours. 'So . far I’ve done Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson and I’ve just started . Liza Minnelli and whatever else comes along. I’ve got an order from a . friend for an Elvis one. Return to sender: John has also made a portrait of Elvis Presley. Sometimes John uses as many as 1,500 stamps in each piece . 'I’ve . done one for the 2012 Olympics, I’ve not seen anything in stamps about . like that before, and it’s quite unusual. It’s not easy because it can . take so long and I hate wasting stamps. You do also end up with lots of . glue on your hands.' John says he was first inspired to . collect when he saw a little dish his uncle made completely out of . stamps and couldn’t get over how unusual it was. And from there his collection grew and grew with him even purchasing three bin liners full of postage stamps for £300. But after years of making plates, cards and gifts for friends and family he decided to branch out to re-creating images. He . added: 'I’ve collected stamps on and off over many years. I first got . the idea in my aunt’s house when I saw a plate on her wall, made by my . now late uncle and he’d done it out of stamps. What a dish: John with one of the plate collages he has created, commemorating the London 2012 Olympics . 'It . was four or five different colours and I’d never seen anything like it . before. I used to do plates and then I thought there must be a way of . using the stamps in pictures. 'But when you pixilate an image the pixels are square and stamps are oblong, so it’s not easy and then you have all the colours and shading as well. 'The Elvis one must have taken me over thirty hours alone. I’ve got to get my stamps first of all cutting them off or steaming them off and drying them and then sorting them into colours and getting them ready to start. 'The problem is its very hard to get someone to be able to pixilate a picture, there’s only one person I’ve found who can do it properly. 'But I’ve also done birthday cards, Christmas cards all made out of postage stamps they’re much better than the ones you can buy over the internet.

A family watch on in horror as bulldozers smash their home to make way for sewage pipes for the Olympic village in Russia. Sergei Khlystov and his son-in-law Maxim Samokhval tried to block the bulldozers at first but stood aside and watched as their two-storey house in Mirny, Sochi was destroyed in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Mr Khlystov’s family is one of at least 1,500 in the path of bulldozers clearing for the Games, which less than 500 days away. In the bulldozer's path: Sergei Khlystov's daughter Tatyana Samokhval and her mother Valentina Khlystova embrace as their home is destroyed by bulldozers as they clear land for sewage pipes for the Olympic village . While Mr Khlystov, 55, may have lost his house, the distress does not stop there. He has failed to prove that the family owned the land on which their house was built, a condition for resettling in a new house in exchange. Mr Samokhval’s wife, Tatyana, even appealed to the local priest as well as the local authorities. Mr Samokhval said: ‘She went to the spiritual authorities and the secular authorities. ‘One said “pray” and the other said “sue”.’ On bailiff orders, half his house was bulldozed a few days before workers, accompanied by police, returned to finish the job on September 21 even though the family continued to live there with Mr Somokhval’s children, aged three and eight. On bailiff orders: Half the house was bulldozed a few days before workers returned to finish the job even though the family continued to live there . Mrs Samokhval with her crying daughter Katya in front of their partially demolished house as houses all along this stretch of the Black Sea are pulled down and some 1,500 people are resettled . All along the stretch of the Black Sea coast, houses have been pulled down and thousands of people resettled in the Olympic building boom that has overtaken the city of 340,000 people in the shadow of the Caucasus Mountains. The Russian Government has spent a reported 15.5 billion rubles (£307.14 million) before the end of 2011 to resettle 90 per cent of the people whose homes had been demolished. For President Vladimir Putin, the Games are a prestige project that will allow him to showcase Russia's ability to organise major events and boost its international image. He regards the event as an important . element of his new presidential term as well as a chance for the . country, which will also host the 2018 World Cup soccer finals, to show . off its sporting prowess. Construction . of the Olympic venues and infrastructure alone is expected to cost more . than £3.7 billion, and half of this will be privately financed. The . final bill for hosting the Olympics in Sochi, most of whose spas and . resort hotels date from the days of Stalin, who died in 1953, is likely . to end up much higher. Construction of the sports facilities is about 70 per cent complete, officials say. New . homes are being provided for Sochi residents displaced by the . reconstruction of their town but such is the importance of the project . that people who do not want to move, have no option but to get out of . the way of the bulldozers. Olympic construction: The 'Fisht' Olympic stadium under construction in August is one of six stadiums which is part of an estimated venue and infrastructure construction bill of more than £3.7billion . Nearly there: With the Games less than 500 days away, construction of the sports facilities is about 70 per cent complete . The New York-based watchdog, Human . Rights Watch, urged the International Olympic Committee to intervene, . saying ‘the illegal eviction of a family in Sochi casts a dark shadow . over preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games’. Other . Sochi residents have complained that compensation has in some cases . been arbitrary, and some have accused the local authorities of damaging . the environment and harming wildlife. Just . out of sight of Mr Khlystov’s garden is the Iceberg stadium, one of six . stadiums to be built in the complex as venues for ice event and Olympic . ceremonies. Hotels, sports . facilities and general improvements are under construction in the city, . and work is going on in the mountains above Sochi where other events . will be held. Some Sochi residents are happy with their new homes given to the m in exchange for being uprooted. Viktor Altunyan, an employee in the . Sochi department of culture, was moved from a small house in Mirny to a . newly built village a short distance away near the border with Georgia's . Abkhazia region. He now . lives in a house more than twice the size with his mother, wife and . young child, surrounded by almost identical homes decorated with similar . paintwork. International image: President Vladimir Putin (right) believes the construction (left the 'Fisht' stadium) is a change for Russia to showcase their ability to organise major events and boost its international image . He said: ‘The president's words came true for me,’ referencing Putin's pledge that people should not be moved into worse housing. ‘It's better here in terms of location and utilities, electricity and water. It's only positive.’ He says he no longer misses his old house, which he built himself and lived in for 15 years. Dmitry Chernyshenko, President of the Sochi 2014 Organising Committee, told reporters in Moscow: ‘The state built villages, perfect houses. I don't have such a house. Without commenting on the Khlystov case specifically, he said: ‘Sometimes people built buildings without any permission on land which did not belong to them. ‘They are trying to earn money from the state.’ About . 180 cases will be settled in court, most of them disputes over house . valuation, Saurin said. In cases where cash compensation was not . provided, the government had built seven new residential developments . and apartment blocks, he said. About 180 cases will be settled in court, most of them disputes over valuation, Saurin said. Plea to intervene: New York-based watchdog, The Human Rights Watch, has urged the International Olympic Committee to intervene . In cases where cash compensation was not provided, the government had built seven new residential developments and apartment blocks, he said. Mr Khlystov said he had lived in Mirny for more than three decades since being given some land there in the Soviet era. But Oksana Rafalskaya, a spokeswoman for the Krasnodar regional government's Olympic department, said the Khlystovs had never established the right to use the land for a residence so it remained government property. She said Khlystov's extended family had been offered flats as compensation. Nina Shishimorova, a neighbour of the Khlystovs said: ‘When the construction is over, it will be better. ‘We already have roads and they've started picking up the rubbish again. Compared to the way the rest of Russia is living, we don't live too badly.’ Such construction and resettlement programmes are not unusual for an Olympics. Rights groups criticised China for forced evictions before the 2008 Beijing Games, with some estimates indicating that 1.5 million people were moved, many against their will. The Chinese government said the demolition of homes in parts of Beijing earmarked for development before the Olympics was carried out fairly and legally. A few London residents were also rehoused because of construction work before this year's Olympics in Britain.","At least 1,500 families are in the path of bulldozers clearing for the Games .

A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal over the last 15 months and now authorities have vowed to kill the ferocious beast. The severed head of the latest victim, a 4-year-old boy, was found in the forest a kilometer from his home this morning, said Kamal Prasad Kharel, the police chief of the Baitadi district, an area 373 miles west of Kathmandu. CNN reported that the creature dragged the child away into the jungle to eat, the 15th victim since the attacks began last year. A leopard has killed at least 15 people in a remote region of Nepal. Stock image . The police chief suspects that a single leopard, at most two, with a taste for human flesh is responsible for the deaths. Maheshwor Dhakal, an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu, agreed that a group of the animals, which are common in the low mountain areas of Nepal, would cause even more bloodshed. He said: 'Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer'. He added that the actual death toll could be higher than 15, because there have been other animal attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India, which borders Baitadi district. Of the 15 victims in Nepal so far, two-thirds are children below the age of 10 and all are from small villages in the remote region. The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest. 'No adult male has been killed,' Kharel said. After killing its victim, the leopard drags the body away into the forest to eat. Leopards are common in Nepal, but most hunt wild and domestic animals . 'In the case of the children it just leaves behind the head, eating everything, but some parts of the adult body are left behind because it cannot finish it,' Kharel added. The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilised armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the leopard and has announced a $300 reward to anyone who captures or kills it. It is it is illegal to kill wild animals . in the region but the chief district administrator has granted a . special dispensation for this leopard to be killed.

David McNally, who has lived most of his life in Staten Island, is organizing an unofficial shadow marathon with his friends and they’re looking for company. ‘My friends and I are still planning to run the course, starting in Bay Ridge and we are recruiting people!’ McNallly said. Cancelled: The New York City Marathon was cancelled amid criticism it would drain valuable resources from hurricane recovery and insult residents who'd lost homes and loved ones . He’s also started a Facebook page to rescue the marathon, inviting others to take to the course with him on Sunday, Gothamist reported. ‘For those of who are disenfranchised from running this Sundays NYC Marathon, come join me to run the course this Sunday. It takes a lot to train for such a feat and to come so far to run the worlds most popular marathon shouldn't draw anger or diversion, but unity and respect for the greatest city in the world,’ he wrote. ‘Ive lived on Staten island for the greater part of my life and i believe by running this marathon it would raise money and draw admiration for the resiliency of the greatest city in the world.

'Even though it is canceled we should . run it anyway for our selves, but most of all for all those that we . have lost during this week. 'The . show must go on.

Despite criticism, the mock-marathoners say the race will be proof of New York's resiliency . So far 77 people have joined McNally’s Facebook group for the proposed run. McNally’s project was met with some criticism from people who felt the marathon was insulting to people who’s homes have been destroyed or lost loved ones. ‘Instead of running past neighborhoods where people’s homes once stood in a display of defiance, how about you volunteer and make your trip to NYC worth something bigger than your pride,’ William F Hattar wrote on the Facebook group’s wall.

The stories have been put together by 17 institutions including museums, foundations and others who have drawn on their archives of letters, manuscripts, first-hand video testimonials and more. Much of the material is very moving - and some is being shown online for the first time. The new exhibitions are the latest chapter in the work of the Google Cultural Institute, which has already showcased the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Holocaust Museum at Yad Vashem and the Nelson Mandela archives online.

His spectacular rise and fall . provides the defining personal story of Ireland's 1990s rise as a . property-obsessed Celtic Tiger - and its stunning collapse in 2008 when . that Anglo-driven construction boom turned to bust. Aerial of the rear of Sean Quinn's house in Ballyconnell . New home: This is an aerial view showing Mountjoy prison situated on the North circular road in Dublin where Quinn will spend the next nine weeks . The son of a Northern Ireland border farmer, Quinn started his first construction-materials business in 1973 with a £100 loan. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s canny acquisitions allowed his empire to grow from cement to hotels, insurance to bottlemaking, his name adorning trucks and office blocks across Ireland. He built a fiercely loyal following in his native borderland, a traditionally jobs-poor region, where he based most of his enterprises. Forbes in 2008 listed him as the 164th richest man in the world. But fatefully and inexplicably, he bet his family's riches on the continued runaway success of Anglo, the most daring of Ireland's property financiers, whose shares rose tenfold during the boom years. Worse, as Anglo's share price reversed course in the run-up to the global credit crisis in 2008, he kept doubling down, borrowing billions from Anglo itself to become the bank's top owner with up to 28 per cent of its shares. Ireland nationalised Anglo in early . 2010, rendering Quinn's stock worthless and leaving taxpayers with a . bill expected to exceed £20 billion, including Quinn's loan defaults. Quinn . and his family contend in a separate, continuing lawsuit that Anglo's . loans to them were largely illegal because the bank didn't disclose the . true scale of its problems, so they shouldn't have to repay them. The Irish businessman's striking blue Agusta 109E helicopter . Bleak times: The Headquarters of the Quinn Insurance Group in Cavan town which went into administration . Lawyers for the former Anglo, now reorganised as a toxic debt-management agency called the Irish Bank Resolution Corp., insisted all Quinn's assets, whether at home or abroad, must be seized to repay a bill owed ultimately to Irish taxpayers. Irish courts agreed. During court proceedings over the past year, Quinn and his children were caught concealing the last-minute shifting of ownership for properties to foreign-based fronts and allies, including by making a secret $500,000 payment to a Ukrainian businesswoman to receive legal control of assets that included a shopping mall. Anglo had been due to take control of those properties the next day. The judge, Dunne, ruled earlier this year that Quinn's defense was incredible and evasive. She postponed his jailing to Friday in hopes his family would reverse the asset-stripping moves in compliance with more than 30 court orders. She ruled Friday this had failed to happen and Quinn 'has only himself to blame.' In June she ordered that Quinn's son, Sean Jr., and his nephew Peter be jailed for three months in punishment for their role in asset-stripping. Sean Jr served his sentence but the Peter fled to neighboring Northern Ireland, where border communities staged several public rallies in support of the Quinns.","Billionaire property tycoon opted to go straight to prison for his 'outrageous' contempt .

Two nurses have avoided prison and have been sentenced to just probation in the malnutrition death of a teenage girl who had cerebral palsy and weighed 28 pounds when she died. Mary Kilby of Miamisburg, Ohio and Kathryn Williams of Englewood, Ohio were sentenced to up to five years of probation in a Dayton court on Wednesday, avoiding a sentence of 18 months in jail. Their sentence stems from the March 1, 2011 death of 14-year-old Makayla Norman, who a coroner said at the time was the 'worst malnourished child' his office had ever seen. Sentenced: Mary Kilby, left, and Kathryn Williams have been sentenced to up to five years probation for the death of a 14-year-old girl in their care and have been stripped of their nursing licenses . Authorities say the teen had numerous bed sores and was living in filthy conditions when she died from nutritional and medical neglect complicated by cerebral palsy. Kilby, 64, and Williams, 43, had pleaded no contest to charges of failing to provide for a functionally impaired child and could have faced up to 18 months in prison at their sentencing. As part of Wednesday's sentence, handed down by Judge Mary Katherine Huffman, both women had to agree to surrender their nursing licenses and will no longer be allowed to practice in Ohio. They both still face misdemeanor charges in a juvenile court that could carry prison time and have a status conference scheduled for Monday. The trial in that court has not yet been scheduled. Loss: Makayla Norman had numerous bed sores and was living in filthy conditions when she died from nutritional and medical neglect complicated by cerebral palsy in March 2011 . Torture: A coroner said at the time she was the 'worst malnourished child' his office had ever seen . Locked up: Makayla's mother, Angela Norman, is serving nine years in prison for the death . The nurses' attorneys argued that they . had much less significant roles in Makayla's death than the teen's . mother and another nurse. Her mother, Angela Norman of Dayton, was sentenced to nine years in prison stemming from the death. The other nurse, Mollie Parsons, is set for trial November 5 and has pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter, failing to provide for a functionally impaired child and tampering with records. Prosecutors say the teen was supposed to be cared for by her mother and Parsons, whose job was to administer care to the girl six days a week. Williams was to supervise Parsons, visit and inspect the living conditions, and do a physical assessment of the girl every 30 to 60 days, and Kilby was scheduled to visit every six months to check on conditions in the home and assess the girl's health, needs and care, prosecutors say. Brad Baldwin, Williams' attorney, said his client 'is very, very heartbroken and remorseful'. 'Throughout Kathryn's nursing career, she's done many good things and helped many people,' he said. 'This is a case where things went terribly wrong, but she does take full responsibility for her involvement in this tragedy.' Dennis Lieberman, who represents Kilby, said the retired grandmother also regrets Makayla's death. 'If Mary could go back in time, she would have done things differently,' he said.","Makayla Norman was living in filthy conditions when she died in 2011 .

Old habits: MIT researchers have found an area of the brain that controls which habits are switched on at a particular time . Old habits die hard, so the saying goes - but they may be overridden, suggests a new study which raises hopes for the treatment of obsessive behaviours. Scientists have identified a brain region which can switch us between new and old habits, raising questions about how automatic habitual behaviours really are. Habits are wired so deeply in our brains that we perform them automatically, such as getting to work each day. This frees up the brain to think of other things - like what to have for dinner. But MIT scientists say that the brain does not completely relinquish control of habitual behaviour. A small region of the prefrontal cortex, where most thought and planning occurs, is responsible for moment-by-moment control of which habits are switched on at a given time. 'We’ve always thought - and I still do - that the value of a habit is you don’t have to think about it. It frees up your brain to do other things,' said Professor Ann Graybiel of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research. 'However, it doesn’t free up all of it. There’s some piece of your cortex that’s still devoted to that control.' The research suggests that bad habits, however deeply ingrained, could be overidden by the brain’s planning centres. This could lead to possible intervention in those suffering from conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder. Dr Kyle Smith carried out on tests on rats in which the rodents were placed in a T-shaped maze. As the rats approached the decision point, they heard a tone indicating whether they should turn left or right. When they chose correctly, they received a reward — chocolate milk for turning left or sugar water for turning right. Even when researchers removed the rewards the rats eventually responded to the tones in the same way, showing the behaviours had become fully ingrained. And when the reward for turning left correctly was spiked with a substance that made the rats sick, they would still turn left when cued to do so - but simply not consume the fluid. Obsessive: The discovery could lead to new treatments for those who are held in thrall to obsessive habits like gambling . The team then altered part of the prefrontal cortex known as the infralimbic (IL) cortex, which is needed for habitual behaviour to develop. If you think giving rats a drink to make them sick to investigate habits is a little cruel, spare a thought for these unfortunate rodents. Scientists investigating the spread of cancer cells surgically implanted windows into the bellies of live mice. The glass portholes stitched directly into the rodents' abdominal walls are intended to help researchers track how cancer cells spread to form secondary tumours. Dutch researchers surgically removed a section of a mouse's abdominal wall altogether and replaced it with a tiny glass pane about half an inch wide surrounded by a biocompatible titanium ring. 'It's just like a window in a ship or a plane,' Dr Jacco van Rheenen of the Hubrecht Institute for Developmental Biology and Stem Cell Research in the Netherlands told New Scientist. Tightly stitched to the skin and abdominal wall, the windows reportedly did not impair the rodents' movements and they caused no signs of infection and inflammation. However, in just over one in 50 cases the glass panes did break, with presumably grisly consequences. Where this did not occur, the windows remained in place for an average of five weeks before the stitches loosened, giving the Hubrecht Institute team plenty of time to record their findings. Using optogenetics, a technique that . allows researchers to inhibit specific cells with light, they turned off . IL cortex activity for several seconds as the rats approached the point . in the maze where they had to decide which way to turn. Almost instantly, the rats dropped the habit of running to the left, the side with the now nauseating reward. This . suggests that turning off the IL cortex switches the rats’ brains from . an 'automatic, reflexive mode to a mode that’s more cognitive or engaged . in the goal - processing what exactly it is that they’re running for,' Dr Smith said. Once broken of the habit of running left, the rats soon formed a new habit, running to the right side every time, even when cued to run left. The researchers showed that they could break this new habit by once again inhibiting the IL cortex with light. To their surprise, they found that these rats immediately regained their original habit of running left when cued to do so. 'This habit was never really forgotten,' Dr Smith said. 'It’s lurking there somewhere, and we’ve unmasked it by turning off the new one that had been overwritten.' Professor Graybiel said that the findings showed the IL cortex is responsible for determining, moment-by-moment, which habitual behaviours will be expressed. She said: 'To us, what’s really stunning is that habit representation still must be totally intact and retrievable in an instant, and there’s an online monitoring system controlling that.' Jane Taylor, a professor of psychiatry and psychology at Yale University, who was not part of the research team, said the study also raises interesting ideas concerning how automatic habitual behaviours really are. 'We’ve always thought of habits as being inflexible, but this suggests you can have flexible habits, in some sense,' she added. Professor Graybiel said it would be too invasive to use the same techniques to break habits in humans but the technology could one day evolve to a point where it could be used to treat compulsive or addictive behaviour. The teams findings were reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","MIT researchers identify brain region that controls habitual behaviours .

Tougher than the rest: Kaytlynn Welsch, far left, isn't just competing in endurance races, but is winning against athletes typically 20 years older than her . In August, Kaytlynn won the women’s division of a major 13-mile race through Cameron Park in Waco, Texas and Heather finished third. After that win, Kaytlynn was triumphed as a ‘12-year-old trail running phenom’ by Outside magazine. The story provoked much debate on Twitter. Many readers found the girls inspiring, while others questioned if perhaps their parents were pushing them to do too much too young. The girls’ mother Niki Welsch, 42, . says she and husband Rodney, also 42, have gotten used to people . questioning their parenting skills. ‘These people don’t know us. They’re on the outside and can’t see the inside,” she told The New York Times. Rodney Welsch is an analytical chemist for a plastics manufacturing company, while Niki works weekends as a registered nurse for hospice patients. As parents, Niki and Rodney like to set high standards for their daughters. Kaytlynn, in seventh grade, and Heather, in fifth, are expected to keep at least a 93 average in each subject at school. Some people have found the girls success to be inspiring, while others have questioned if their parents are pushing them to do too much too soon . Daddy's girls: Heather, left, and Kaytlynn are pictured with their father and coach Rodney Welsch . At home, television is banned and instead a large treadmill sits beside the sofa in the family room. The girls are however allowed their own smart devices, Kaytlynn has an iPhone and Heather an iPad. Both parents are athletic and wanted their children to be active at sports too. The girls' puny size - both are small for their ages and each weighs about 60 pounds - was a disadvantage for most sports. However four years ago their father heard about children’s triathlons where competitors could start as young as seven and the distances weren't very long. He started to take his daughters along and was pleasantly surprised by how well they did. In 2010, he began entering his daughters in road races of up to 10K. The girls usually beat anyone their age and outran most women in their 20s and 30s. Since then they’ve competed in more than 160 races. Some have been over modest distances specifically for kids, but most have covered mileage meant to challenge adults. Kaytlynn had finished two marathons and both girls have also competed in triathlons, typically involving a 500 meter swim, 13 mile cycle and 3.1-mile run. The sisters have competed in more than 160 endurance races over the past two years . Kaytlynn, left, shows off one of her trophies, while Heather, right, takes part in a road race . The girls' preference however is for 13-mile trail runs over rough terrain, which are much tougher than a half-marathon, the comparable distance run on road. The conditions for trail runs typically favor seasoned athletes and the woman’s race is typically won by those in their 30s or even 40s. In triathlons and trail runs, age requirements are often set by the race director. However, many leave the decision to parents as long as they sign a waiver of responsibility. The family have become accustomed to people questioning if all this endurance running is healthy for growing girls. As concerned parents, the Welschs have researched the risks and taken their daughters to a series of doctors. Experts offer differing views about what impact, if any, running so many endurance races can have on their young bodies. Some have warned that distance running can put stress on their growth plates and also delay the onset of puberty. Kaytlynn Welsch says other kids complain she isn¿t fun because she can't sleepover at weekends because of her race schedule . The Welschs remain cautious and when the girls have complained of plains, their doctor has treated them with anti-inflammatories and recommended strengthening exercises. As well as impact on their young bodies, there is also the impact on their childhoods. Kaytlynn says other kids complain she isn’t fun because she can't sleepover at weekends because of her race schedule. As a result she doesn't have many school friends. The girl’s don’t train much on weekdays, but on a typical weekend they will . compete in one endurance event, and often two. They may run . a 10K on Saturday and follow that with a triathlon on Sunday.

According to Van Hooser's attorney, Susan Hutchinson, her client was pulled over on Bowen Road on October 28, 2011, for driving with her headlights off after dark - an accusation she disputes. Van Hooser was then arrested for having a warrant out for an unpaid speeding ticket. As the woman was being taken into custody, her lawyer claim that officer Alvarez slammed her body against the car, spread her legs and roughly pulled her arms far behind her back to put on the handcuffs, according to NBC 5. In the process, Hutchinson said an implant in her client's right breast had burst. According to the suit, Van Hooser screamed out in pain, telling the officer that she had undergone spinal surgery in 2008 and tried to show him her scar. The lawsuit filed against the town of Pantego and the local police department goes on to state that the woman was in such agony that she begged for help and began to lose all feeling in her arms. In response, Alvarez allegedly told her, 'You're not supposed to be comfortable.' The Pantego officer pulled her over on a headlight violation and arrested her after learning she had a warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket . Rebecca Van Hooser is now suing the town . Van Hooser was then put into a squad car, where she told a second officer about her pain and surgery. The cops eventually relented and handcuffed the woman in the front before hauling her off to jail, Fox 4 reported. In the aftermath of the arrest, Hutchinson said Van Hooser suffered two hematomas and had to undergo four surgeries. Rebecca Van Hooser said the rupture has led to health problems . She will also have to have a partial mastectomy, tissue transplant and have a new implant inserted. Pantego officials said the town has complete faith in its police force. The town said its officers always conduct themselves in the most professional manner. The police department responded to the lawsuit by dismissing Van Hooser’s excessive force claims. ‘Our preliminary investigation shows there is not merit to the allegations,’ Police Chief Thomas Griffith said in a statement.","Rebecca Van Hooser claims she 'screamed out in pain, telling the officer that she had undergone spinal surgery in 2008'

Superbowl Champ Warren Sapp has sold his palatial home in Windermere Florida for $2.1 million to a fitness celebrity who made her fortune with workout videos. Brenda Dykgraaf was the high bidder at the Thursday’s auction of Sapp’s estate, according to Fisher Auction. ‘[It was] strictly a real estate deal,’ Dykgraaf told reporters. ‘I live in Wesley Snipes’ old home right next to where Tiger Woods used to live so it doesn’t really matter to me.’ Scroll down for video . Lucky winner: Dykgraaf made her fortune selling fitness programs and exercise machines on the Home Shopping Network . Busted: Sapp lost most of his money in an investment to build low-income housing before the real estate market crashed . No stranger to profiting from the poor business acumen of celebrities, Dykgraaf bought Snipe’s house just before he went to federal prison for tax evasion. Dykgraaf said she wouldn’t live in the house but might use Sapp’s celebrity to market it. Dygraaf, 51, is the star of several home exercise videos including Disco Workout and Whole Body Workout and has sold fitness equipment for the Home Shopping Network including the AirClimber and Ab Roller Plus. Luxury home: Sapp's 10,000 square foot estate was built for appromixmately $7 million just seven years ago but only sold for $2.1 million this week . Built in 2005 for $7 million, the 10,000 square foot Tuscan style home is filled with luxuries. There are four large bedrooms, a wine cellar, a private movie theater, and a custom resort-style swimming pool complete with waterside and lazy river.

Dykgraaf was one of five registered bidders who eposited $300,000 in cash each for the chance to bid for Sapp’s home with the initial asking price set at $1.6 million. Sapp¿s home is rumored to still house a pair of Mohammed Ali¿s boxing gloves and more than 200 pairs of Nike Air Jordan¿s the former NFL star collected . The auction lasted only 15 minutes before Dykgraaf’s bid wasn’t matched. ‘You always hope for more bidders,’ said Lamar Fisher, owner of the Pompeo Beach auction company. A deal: Dykgraaf said she wouldn¿t live in the house but had purchased it strictly as a real estate deal . Sapp, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers stay who played in the National Football League for 13 seasons told the Tampa Tribune that he had to file for bankruptcy to avoid jail time. Last resort: Sapp said he wouldn¿t have declared bankruptcy or sold the beautiful Tuscon home if there was another way to stay out of prison . ‘Do you think I wanted to declare bankruptcy?’ he said to reporters. ‘Do you think, if there was any other way possible, I would have done it? It was either this or go to jail.’ Great outdoors: Sapp's yard features 500 feet of combined frontage leading to a boat house and dock . Sapp lost much of his money in a plan to build a low-income housing project in Fort Pierce, but the market dropped out after he invested in the deal leading to his NFL wages being garnished for 11 months as his bills went unpaid.","NFL star had to sell his luxury mansion after filing for bankruptcy .

This astonishing time-lapse video released by  NASA shows just how Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc across the US East Coast. The superstorm's path was predicted almost exactly by the National Hurricane Center - and this accurate forecast was critical to ensuring authorities knew which direction it would take. The centre, based in Miami, Florida, had an average error in its track forecast three days into the future for Sandy of just 71 miles, which dropped to only 48 miles within two days of it hitting. Scroll down for videos . First-look: Sandy is seen over the Caribbean on October 25 at 06:40 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) Moving along: Sandy is seen last Sunday (October 28) at 17:32 UTC, just before it struck the US East Coast . Devastation: Sandy hit the US East Coast last Monday (October 29) and it is pictured here at 15:45 UTC . Destruction: Sandy passes over New Jersey and causes huge damage on Tuesday (October 30) at 03:55 UTC . Leaving: Sandy begins to leave the US on Wednesday (October 31) at 11:45 UTC after causing destruction . This is compared to an average error of 518 miles in 1970, 345 miles in 1990 and 138 miles from 2007 to 2011. The average in the past five years was 96 miles, reported the Washington Post. The NHC correctly predicted by last Thursday morning that southern New Jersey would be near the centre of Sandy’s track forecast - around 108 hours before it hit land. Andrew Freedman of research group Climate Central said that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration figures show track forecasts have improved by 50 per cent over the past 15 years. He added: ‘During the period from 2003 to 2008, the average storm track forecast had an error that was down to less than 200 miles at 72 hours, and less than 100 miles at 48 hours.’ Burning: This aerial photo shows a fire in the wake of Superstorm Sandy in Jersey Shore on Wednesday . Rebuild: A new break in the island across Route 35 at the Herbert Street bridge in Mantoloking, New Jersey . Wrecked: Destruction in the wake of Superstorm Sandy on Wednesday in Seaside Heights, New Jersey . But the five-day forecast error margin for Hurricane Isaac, which hit Louisiana in August, was 253 miles - above the modern-day average of 245 - although it was only 70 miles out with 48 hours to go. And storm intensity forecasts have not progressed like track forecasts over recent years, because computer models still have problems capturing small-scale details such as air mass characteristics. Sandy was blamed for at least 98 deaths in the US and Canada, and left New Jersey's barrier islands a wasteland of eroded shoreline, ruined beachfront homes, flooded streets and damaged utilities. As New York City came back to life yesterday, starting with the partial reopening of subway routes three days after the storm, it was revealed the total U.S. damage could hit $50billion (£31billion). This would make it the second-costliest storm in US history after Hurricane Katrina. Warnings also rose again over global warming and the prospect of more similar severe weather to come.

The bodies of James Ryals, 73, and his wife, Joyce Ryals, 74 were discovered at their Ormond . Beach home, Florida, last night after a relative in New Jersey raised the alarm when she could not contact them. Police believe Mr Ryals shot his wife before killing himself and police said they had a difficult relationship, although it is not know what the motive was.

Though the note found by officers did not say anything about the double killing, Mr Davidson revealed there were some marital problems between the couple. He said, however, that there was no clear motive for why Mr Ryal would have killed his 74-year-old wife and then shot himself. 'We don't know for sure why this happened and we may never know,' Mr Davidson said.

The warring family of Dallas Cowboys' Tyron Smith have been accused in a row over $1 million missing from the NFL star's bank account. A lawyer for Smith has claimed the player's mother and her step children have continually demanded money from the 21-year-old offensive tackle. Dallas-based attorney John Schorsch warned that a legal action will follow a 'forensic' review of the his accounts. Rising star: Dallas Cowboy Tyron Smith grabs New York Giants' Jason Pierre-Paul during their game last month . But Smith's mother, Frankie Pinkney, denied that the family took any of the money without his agreement or harassed or threatened him in any way. Star: Tyron Smith took out an order against his family barring them from approaching him or his girlfriend . 'I don’t know anything about any missing money,' Pinkney told SportsdayDFW, the official sports website of the Dallas Morning News. 'The money that we did receive from Tyron was all accounted for and everything is in writing, and he’s authorised all of it.' Last Tuesday police responded to a 911 call from Smith’s North Dallas home after two of his step sisters, Tiari Dennis and Brittany Pinkney, were among at least three people outside his front door. They were there to 'harass and torment' him 'in the pursuit of collecting financial gain,' according to the police report. The latest incident comes after Smith filed a family safety protective . order in the summer  against his stepfather, Roy Pinkney, and his mother to keep them . from having any contact with him or his live-in girlfriend  Leigh Costa. In an email statement to the Dallas Morning News, Pinkney denied any family demands for  money and blamed her son's girlfriend for the feud. She backed her daughters and said her that her son had 'hurt' and 'betrayed' her. Pinkney who owns a cleaning business in Riverside, California, claimed 26-year-old Costa would not  let her daughters in the door. Pinkney told the paper: 'They had not seen nor talked to him in months due to a family disagreement, which by the way, was not about finances.' The Morning News quoted sources which claimed the NFL player  gave his family a substantial amount of money after signing a four-year, $12.5 million contract in July 2011 after he was drafted from the University of Southern California. Pinkney would not say how much money her son gave her. Burt Smith's lawyer hit out at the  'parasite mentality' surrounding professional athletes. He added: 'I’m not certain of the amount of money that’s gone. I would suggest that the numbers are in the seven digits that need to be accounted for. 'I don’t know how much of that, if any, is a legitimate gift and how much of that is squeezed out of him or how much of that is flat out taken. And I know of the latter two categories it’s a bunch. 'I’m going to make sure all the money is justified and it’s not going to be pretty.' Smith declined to comment to the paper when approached in the Cowboys’ locker room earlier this week.","Dallas Cowboy's lawyer claims family continually demanded cash .

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch swatted away a shareholder revolt at News Corporation's annual general meeting last night. A motion for the 81-year-old to step down as chairman of News International’s parent company was easily defeated in a vote at the Los Angeles meeting. Other attempts to diminish the Murdoch family’s control also failed in the wake of the company’s huge 44 per cent share increase over the past year. Powerful: The motion to remove the wealthy Australian from his post as News Corporation chairman was easily defeated . There was no mention of the £7million former News International chief Rebekah Brooks reportedly received when she resigned at the height of the phone hacking crisis in July last year. The meeting also failed to discuss claims that James Murdoch was being lined up for a top job in charge of Fox in the U.S. despite the uproar over his handling of the scandal in Britain. Mr Murdoch made his feelings clear in a Twitter posting in the run-up to the meeting, declaring that ‘any shareholders with complaints should take profits and sell!’ ‘If you don’t like it, don’t buy the stock,’ he added in one flinty exchange with a shareholder yesterday. Referring to the scandal that resulted in the closure of the News of the World and the arrest of Sun journalists, the Australian tycoon admitted at the meeting that the company had ‘mishaps.’ But he insisted News Corporation had ‘seized the opportunity to make amends.’ News International has now been dogged by the accusations of phone hacking at its newspapers for years. 'Golden goodbye': There was no mention at the meeting of Rebekah Brooks' £7million pay-off when she resigned over the phone hacking scandal at News International tabloid the News of the World . Now-defunct tabloid the News of the World allegedly conspired to hack the voicemail of celebrities and even the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002. David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson and Brooks will face trial along with five other journalists from the paper over the allegations next September. Executives and journalists from News International publication The Sun have also been arrested over the allegations. Despite the scandal, Brooks was awarded a bumper pay-off when she resigned over the allegations, it emerged yesterday. The sum is thought to have consisted of cash and pension payments as well as an allowance for legal fees and the use of a chauffeur-driven car. The award - much higher than the £1.7m cash pay-out previously reported - looked set to rile investors at today's meeting. Mr Murdoch's words last night did not stop some institutional investors from demanding changes in the way News Corporation is run, but there was no rebellion of the kind he faced at last year’s meeting at the height of the scandal, when he again overcame calls for his ouster. On trial: Brooks, pictured leaving the Old Bailey with her husband Charlie, who is also charged with conspiring to pervert the course of . justice . His critics did get their chance to speak at yesterday’s meeting on the Fox film studio lot – but only after he had announced that their motions had already been outvoted. Julie Tanner, of Christian Brothers Investment Services, said it was a ‘conflict of interests’ for Mr Murdoch to serve both as chairman and as chief executive officer. She called the company’s reforms in the wake of the phone hacking ‘timid’ and warned that without structural changes, the scandals would ‘cloud the company for the foreseeable future.’ Ian Greenwood, of the UK Local Authorities Pension Fund, supported the move to strip Mr Murdoch of the chairmanship. ‘I’d like to thank you very much for making us a lot of money – but this won’t go away as an issue,’ he added. Even though the Murdoch family owns 13 per cent of the equity in the company, it still controls 40 per cent of the voting stock. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a Saudi investor and a strong supporter of Mr Murdoch, owns an additional seven per cent of the voting stock, making any real changes almost impossible without the chairman’s acquiescence. After the 80-minute meeting, Mr Murdoch and his board of directors left without a serious blow being landed. They even got a round of applause.","A motion for the media mogul to be ousted from his post was defeated .

Designer Robin Wilson was hired by Mary Richardson Kennedy when she was rebuilding the family's mold-infested 1920s house in Bedford, New York State, into a green showpiece home. Wilson has told The New York Post, that part of her job with the Kennedys was to secure products and services for ‘free or as free as possible’ during the renovation project, which lasted from 2008 to 2010. Builder Jim Blansfield, Robert Kennedy Jr., and Mary Richardson Kennedy showed off the finished home in 2010 just months before RFK Jr. filed for divorce .

During the remodeling of the . seven-bedroom mansion, the Kennedys amassed more than $1.3 million in . free products including high-end appliances, dual flush toilets, solid . brass and zinc faucets, hardwood flooring, and hypoallergenic rugs. In . addition, the family used their influence to secure massive discounts . from the builder and other contractors. Builder . Jim Blansfield, who led the two-year construction project, said he . charged 'very, very much less than what I would normally charge. I felt . the project had great merit.' However his work on the house did not lead to an increase in business. Many contractors were promised free publicity and credit in a television show for NBC, which never aired. The . kitchen was designed free-of-charge, and the craftsman who did the . bookcases and fireplace mantels charged half his usual rate. Energy-efficient . windows were provided by a local distributor for a Minnesota company, . Marvin Windows and Doors, at a discount of more than $100,000. But Richardson called Sen. Al Franken, a . Minnesota Democrat and an ally of her husband, and asked him to force . the company to donate the windows. ‘Mary reached out to many people and corporations, including Al Franken,’ Wilson told The New York Post. A spokesman for Franken denied the claim. Other contractors have claimed at . Robin Wilson is reputed to have told the contractors that they wouldn't . receive any credit for their work if they didn't donate the windows for . free. Despite the hard . sell, the window distributor refused to budge and the Kennedys paid . $230,000 for the windows, which had a retail price of $350,000.

Jailed: Steven Ray Milam, 44, will spend 35 years in federal prison for committing 11 bank robberies . A bank robber dubbed the 'handsome guy bandit' for his bizarre hold-up costume, has been jailed. Steven Ray Milam, 44, will spend 35 years in federal prison, a judge ruled on Monday, after he pleaded guilty to 11 robberies in May. Wearing an $810 Hollywood-pro latex mask to hide his features, and brandishing a gun, Milam stormed Dallas banks and demanded cash. He was eventually caught after a high-speed police chase and shootout in Mississippi on New Year's Eve, having left 61 victims in his wake. That final robbery began when he entered the BBVA Compass Bank in Richardson wearing his signature mask, black frame glasses, and latex gloves. Carrying a black semi-automatic handgun and a clear bag, Milam forced staff and customers into the bank's vault, demanding money from the manager. 'No dye packs or trackers,' he said. 'I’ll kill you if you put them in the bag.' He then told his victims to count to 500 and not contact the police before fleeing the scene. As he left he was approached by police and began shooting at their squad car. They backed off and he ran home, packing a bag and driving to Austin where he spent the night. The following day he set off for Florida and was spotted in Mississippi by police who gave chase after he refused to pull over. They put out road spikes as Milam stormed down the highway reaching speeds of 85mph, almost smashing into cars as he did. Caught on camera: Wearing an $810 Hollywood-pro latex mask to hide his features, and brandishing a gun, Milam stormed Dallas banks and demanded cash .

A teenager who had a massive heart attack and 'died' for seven minutes was saved thanks to the quick thinking of his teacher. Dan Edwards, 17, collapsed after running up the stairs at college - while rushing to get to a hospital appointment. His heart stopped beating and the teen was technically dead - but managed to make a miraculous recovery after one of his tutors started CPR - giving him a fighting chance until paramedics arrived. Thanks Sir: Dan with teacher Matt Harwood who gave him CPR while waiting for paramedics . Tutor Matt Harwood desperately battled to keep him alive after calling paramedics - but after realising he had no heartbeat for more than seven minutes, feared the worst. After arriving at hospital, worried doctors warned his terrified parents, Sue and Darren, that they didn't know whether their sporty son would pull through - and if he did, feared he would be severely brain damaged. But amazingly, a month after his brush with death, Dan has stunned medics by making an amazing recovery - and is now recovering at home in Worcester. His mother, Sue, 40, an NHS . administrator, said: 'We are so grateful to everyone who has helped Dan . pull through - we can't thank them enough. 'We . came so close to losing our son, we're just so grateful that so many . people knew basic first aid, and for everything the doctors have done . for him. Dan's scar: He fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat . 'Even after Dan's heart had been restarted, the doctors told us they didn't know if he'd make it through the night. 'We were distraught - just a few hours before our healthy and happy son had been heading off to college on his moped, and now we were being told we might lose him forever. 'It was devastating. Once his heart had been stabilised, they still said that he might have suffered bad brain damage because his heart had been stopped for so long. 'We were told it would take a long time for him to properly wake up - but a few days later, Dan was sitting up in bed laughing and joking. 'Even the nurses in the hospital told us it was a miracle - he was really one of the lucky ones.' Engineering student Dan had been due to attend a hospital appointment for tests after doctors told him they suspected he might have issues with his heart. But after running up a flight of stairs at the Worcester College of Technology, to grab his coat, the teenager suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed, on September 28. Fortunately, one of his tutors, engineering manager Matt Harwood, heard him fall - and despite initially thinking that Dan had fainted and put him in the recovery position - but quickly realised he had no pulse and began CPR. He was joined by colleagues, including community first responder David Price, who took over the CPR, until paramedics arrived and restarted his heart with a defibrillator. Dan said: 'I can't remember much about what happened. I felt like I was in a swimming pool and I had fallen asleep. I could hear the faint voices of the paramedics calling my name, but I didn't know where I was. 'I'm so thankful to the people who saved me - it hasn't really sunk in yet how serious it was.' Dan's parents were already at Worcester Hospital, waiting for Dan to arrive for his appointment when they got a call from the college to say their son was being rushed in. Sue said: 'We were completely panicked - it didn't seem real when they said Dan had collapsed and was in an ambulance. 'We feared the worst, and seeing him in intensive care was devastating. 'The doctors told us they didn't know if he would pull through - they said he was very very sick. 'He was being kept alive by machines and was in a coma. 'They said it would take a long time for him to wake up, but four days after it happened, he was alert and awake. 'The nurses said there's not many people lucky enough to survive what he did - and they said it's a miracle he recovered as quickly as he did.' Relieved: Dan with his mother Sue, father Darren and sister Megan . Matt said: 'We knew that Dan's life was in the balance, so we all worked as hard as we could to save Dan. 'The paramedics were first class and reassured us we did the correct thing and that our reaction had given him a fighting chance. 'I think someone must have been looking down on him.' Dan, who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, has now been fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat. The device, slightly larger than a matchbox, monitors the heart rhythm and can deliver low-voltage electrical impulses to keep the heart beating correctly and larger shocks if needed. Dad Darren, who works in manufacturing, said: 'We are so grateful to the staff at the college, and especially to Matt, who realised what had happened and sprung into action so quickly. 'We want to share Dan's story to encourage people to consider learning basic first aid - it's so simple that anyone could do it, but all of Dan's friends have said that if he'd collapsed in front of them, they wouldn't know what to do. 'I can't thank the staff at the school enough for saving my son's life - there's no way we can repay them.'","Dan collapsed after running up the stairs at college .

A 16-year-old boy has died after being knocked down by a hit-and-run driver as he and his friends crossed the road on their way to a party. Callum Hilton died after suffering a serious head injury when he was hit in Greater Manchester shortly before 6.30pm yesterday evening, despite the efforts of a nurse and neighbours who came to his aid. A man has now been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after the incident in Stand Lane, Radcliffe, Greater Manchester Police said today. Scroll down for video . Hit-and-run: Callum Hilton, 16, died after being knocked down as he crossed the road in Radcliffe, Bury, at around 6.30pm yesterday . The 16-year-old Manchester United fan was rushed to hospital after being knocked down by a silver Peugeot on the busy main road, where he later died from his injuries. The driver sped from the scene at Stand . Lane in Radcliffe, Bury, after the crash on Saturday evening. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said a man was arrested in Radcliffe shortly after 1.30pm today on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Callum's 'distraught' mother Tricia Hilton wrote on a Facebook tribute page set up in memory of the teenager: 'im not going to wake up from a nightmare, my son on the news hit and run... it shouldn't be happenin but now its all becoming real for me.' The 16-year-old was raised by his mother and his grandfather, who have been left 'absolutely distraught' by the tragedy, Greater Manchester Police said. A man who lives nearby and witnessed the 'heartbreaking' scene described how a neighbour, a nurse, and a passerby battled to save the boy as he lay in the road. He said: 'As I was coming back home, the boy was already on the floor and there were two people offering first aid. 'One was a neighbour, a nurse who lives further up the hill and one was a guy who was driving past. 'With the boy were three friends, one was apparently his cousin but I don’t know any of them. 'It was heartbreaking to watch. The lad was in a very, very bad way. 'The frustration of standing there as two people try to save a young kid’s life was heartbreaking.' He said cars were 'always' speeding up and down the road despite a number of signs warning drivers of the 30mph speed limit. 'There was a dog run over about 100 yards up the hill about 10 minutes before this boy was run over last night,' the man said. 'Last week a lady who lives down the road had her car struck. 'So just within this stretch of 200 yards there has been three accidents in a week. It’s very unfortunate.' A bunch of flowers had been left in memory of the teenager at the scene today. The attached card read simply: 'Callum xxx'. Scene: The driver sped from the scene after hitting the 16-year-old in Stand Lane, Radcliffe, as Callum and his friends crossed the road .

'Our thoughts and sympathies are with them at this time and we have a . specially-trained Family Liaison Officer who is supporting Callum's mum . and grandad as they try to come to terms with what has happened. 'We have made an arrest but I would continue to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward,' Det. Insp. Waywell added. She added: 'Callum's family have suffered an unimaginable loss.

'They deserve to know exactly what happened so I . would urge anyone who either witnessed what happened or has information . about the movements of the silver Peugeot 206 to come forward.' Shortly after the crash police recovered an abandoned silver Peugeot close to Bury town centre, but the vehicle has now been ruled out of the inquiry. 'It is now believed another silver Peugeot 206 was the vehicle involved,' a GMP spokesman said. Anyone with information should call GMP on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","A man has been arrested over the death of 16-year-old Callum Hilton in Bury, Greater Manchester Police said .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 17:13 EST, 26 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:49 EST, 27 October 2012 . Barack Obama today made a new attempt to shore up the youth vote with a live interview on MTV. The President sat down at the White House with anchor Sway Calloway and delivered a careful pitch based around youth-friendly topics such as climate change, college tuition and gay marriage. He also opened up about his personal life, revealing that he has banned his daughter from using Facebook for security reasons, and talking about his anguish at seeing his friends' family members die in gun violence in Chicago. Appeal: Barack Obama appeared on MTV on Friday to boost his standing among young voters . Sit-down: The President was interviewed by MTV News anchor Sway Calloway . The questions for the half-hour interview were sent in by young MTV viewers, and focussed around issues which concern college students and the under-30s. Obama is likely to attract the support of a large majority of young people, but nonetheless faces a fierce battle to boost turnout among the group, who traditionally vote in relatively low numbers. He was in his element during the MTV interview on Friday afternoon, with many of the questions centring around common Democratic talking points such as global warming and women's equality. The first question, predictably, was about youth unemployment, and prompted the President to defend his economic record, arguing: 'We've made real progress since I came into office... but we've got to do a lot more.' Having his say: Obama returned to his native Chicago yesterday in order to cast his vote early . Family: The President in the White House's Oval Office with his daughters Sasha and Malia . When . asked how he would help entrepreneurs, he claimed his administration . was 'making it easier for entrepreneurs to raise money through the . internet' by seeking crowd-funding from a number of small investors. However, . he refused to contemplating forgiving the student debt of graduates who . start their own business, saying it would be better to 'make sure that . folks don't get loaded up on debt in the first place'. Calloway pointed out that the majority of young people now support same-sex marriage, and pressed the President to make a greater commitment to 'ensure that all Americans have equal rights in the eyes of the federal government'. However, Obama - while describing gays as 'outstanding people' - reiterated that 'historically marriages have been defined at the state level', and suggested he would not push for federal legislation to legalise gay marriage nationally. But he insisted, 'The evolution in this country will get us to a place where we will be treating everyone fairly,' and argued that future generations' support of gay marriage would change the political landscape. Guest: A visitor to the White House scopes out the Oval Office's communication systems . Insult: The Obama campaign recently posted this image of Mitt Romney with the caption, 'Sums it up' When the conversation turned to the 'silent epidemic' of gun violence in America's cities, the President spoke of his personal grief at the murders which have blighted his native Chicago. 'These shootings are taking place a few blocks away from my home, and I have friends whose family members have been killed,' he said. Obama also talked about climate change, an issue which did not come in the presidential debates, saying: 'We're not moving as fast as we need to, and this is a problem which future generations will have to be dealing with.' He addressed his hopes and fears for his daughters, Malia and Sasha, as he said: 'They're growing up pretty quick, and when they're out of the house I want to make sure they have the same opportunities as anyone's sons.' The President revealed that Malia found it difficult to balance the stresses of adolescence with life in the public eye, saying: 'Because she's well-known I'm very keen about her protecting her privacy.' He said that she was not allowed to use Facebook for security reasons, but joked that he was not worried about the prospect of her dating - 'because she's got Secret Service protection'. Playtime: Michelle Obama on the campaign trail in Ohio with a young future voter . Number two: Vice President Joe Biden addressed supporters in Wisconsin on Friday . A more cultural moment came towards the end of the interview, when Calloway asked whether Obama was concerned about the decline in political music. The President reminisced about his youthful love of Bob Marley: 'I can remember when i was in college listening - and not necessarily agreeing with everything, but thinking about how people outside our country were thinking about the struggle for jobs and dignity and freedom.' Among modern bands, he praised the Roots, a hip-hop group who are 'doing some really good stuff'. MTV has invited Mitt Romney to participate in a similar event, and the network says it hopes to feature the Republican candidate at some point before election day.

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 12:49 EST, 1 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:50 EST, 1 November 2012 . A suspected robber in Missouri learned the hard way that you don't mess with a bank president - especially one who's packing a Colt .380 pistol at all times. David Thompson, 58, who has stood at the helm of Peoples Bank and Trust in the city of Troy for the past 36 years, turned the tables on a would-be robber wearing a Halloween mask by pulling a gun on him in the parking lot and detaining him until police arrived. ‘I didn’t have time to get scared,’ Thompson, a life member of the National Rifle Association who supports concealed-carry laws, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Armed: Bank President David Thompson, 58, followed and restrained a robber who made off with $5,000 from his bank in Troy, Missouri . Scene of the robbery: The People's Bank and Trust in Troy, where David Thompson has been president for 36 years . Clear warning: A notice on the front door of the bank makes it clear that staff carry concealed weapons - as the would-be assailant found out to his cost . ‘I was excited. Your adrenaline pumps. He robbed a bank, he menaced my employees, and I don’t allow that.’ Thompson later learned that the suspect who attempted to hold up the bank on Tuesday, identified as 58-year-old Donald Lee, was one of his customers. The brave bank president said he was surprised that someone would try to rob the establishment since there is a notice on the front door clearly indicating that 'lawful concealed carry permitted on these premises.' Police said at around 2.30pm on Tuesday, a man in a Chucky mask walked into the bank at 430 East Wood Street and demanded that tellers hand him all the money they had. Thompson was in his office when his receptionist alerted him to the situation playing out in the lobby. When . the banker looked out, he saw a man wearing a heavy jacket and a mask . walking away from the tellers carrying a red bag with $4,779 in cash. That . is when Thompson, who has a black belt in martial arts, jumped into . action, following the man outside and locking the door behind him so as . not to put anyone else at risk. Bank robber: Donald Lee, 58, was a customer at the bank. He walked in wearing a Chucky mask and demanded all the money in the bank. He made off with $4,779 . Frightening: Lee, seen here on CCTV footage, pretended he was carrying a firearm and demanded money. It later emerged he was unarmed . Hold-up: The bank clerk handed over nearly $5,000. The robber was followed by bank president David Thompson, who restrained him at gunpoint until police arrived . There were about 60 employees in the three-storey building and a few customers in the bank at the time. Thompson then drew his Colt .380 pistol and ordered Lee to get out of his car. When the 58-year-old suspect reached into his jacket as if he had a gun, Thompson told him: ‘Sir, you don’t want to do that or this will end badly.' The quick-thinking banker grabbed Lee’s hand and got him out of the Ford pickup truck, after which he stood guard over the alleged crook and prevented him from fleeing. By that point, another bank employee, who also had a concealed weapon on him, came out of the building and helped Thompson keep an eye on Lee until police arrived about a minute later. Pursuit: Mr Thompson is seen following Lee into the bank's car park, where he restrained him with a Colt .380 pistol . Unfazed: Mr Thompson, an NRA member, said he didn't fear for his personal safety in pursuing the assailant . During the police search, Thompson found out that Lee had a debit card from Peoples Bank and Trust, which he received when he opened an account there six months earlier, according to the Lincoln County Journal. Police also revealed that he was not armed. Lee has been charged with first-degree robbery, and his bail bond has been set at $50,000, cash only. Peoples Bank and Trust was last robbed in the 1930s, but all the employees receive training on handing emergency situations like this one every year. In the aftermath, Thompson praised his tellers for remaining calm and handling the robbery by the book. The banker added that at no time was he worried for his own safety because according to him, the robber appeared ‘frail and slow-moving.’ Lee told police he’d gone to the bank only to trick or treat. According to a neighbor, the 58-year-old moved to Troy from Oklahoma about a year ago to live with his daughter and grandchildren, and he may be suffering dementia or Alzheimer’s.","Bank president of 36 years David Thompson followed would-be assailant Donald Lee into the car park and restrained him until police arrived .
