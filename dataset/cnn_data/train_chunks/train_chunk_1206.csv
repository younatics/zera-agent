"Gordon Brown, pictured, has 'no plans' to quit Parliament amid rumours he may step down in 2015. He is pictured here attending the Nelson Mandela Memorial Service, at Westminster Abbey in London in March . Former prime minister Gordon Brown 'will remain' an MP amid speculation that he could stand down as early as next year. Since leaving No 10 Mr Brown has combined his job as a constituency MP with acting as the UN special envoy for global education. Reports have suggested that he would stand down from the Commons at the general election in 2015. But Mr Brown's office said the former Labour leader remained an MP and had 'no plans to make any announcement to the contrary'. His spokesman said Mr Brown was playing an 'active role' campaigning for Scotland to vote No in September's independence referendum. Responding to the claim he would leave the Commons next year, the spokesman said: 'So many people have tried to write this story on so many occasions with no facts. 'Mr Brown has just announced he is playing an active role in the referendum for United with Labour. 'He is giving a major speech next Tuesday and will be delivering a series of lectures on Scotland's future, the dates of which will be announced shortly. 'He is, and will remain, Member of Parliament for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath and he has no plans to make any announcement to the contrary.' Last year Mr Brown described himself as an 'ex-politician'. Taking part in a panel discussion at an education summit in Qatar, Mr Brown was asked his views 'as a politician', at which point he interjected ""ex-politician"".

"The Wall Street protesters had another surprise visitor today when Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon came along to show her support . The 64-year-old stopped by the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Zuccotti Park on her way to Italy this afternoon. She told the crowd: 'I'm just here to be educated and offer my support. There’s a lot of different kinds of people here who want to shift the paradigm to something that’s addressing the huge gap between the rich and the poor. Scroll down for video . Star-studded: Actress and activist Susan Sarandon visits the Square on Day 11 of the Occupy Wall Street protest, which continues gaining momentum and people . Celebrity turnout: Susan Sarandon talked with protesters and gave them advice on what to do, suggesting they focus on one issue and have people sign petitions . 'I'm very happy to be here. I'm here to support freedom of speech. It never changes from the top, it only changes from the bottom. This is great. 'It helps to focus on one thing to be accomplished. Is everyone here registered to vote? Are you having people sign petitions?' Sarandon is a veteran of protest marches and civil disobedience actions for liberal and humanitarian causes. She gave the younger generation of . ralliers some pointers, suggesting that they focus on one issue. Last night, left-wing author and documentary maker Michael Moore made a surprise visit to protesters. A populist but controversial figure, it could only have been a coincidence that his new book, Here Comes Trouble, has just hit book stores. He joined campaigners at Zucotti Park, New York, on the 10th day of protests that have seen nearly 100 arrests and just hours after markets in the U.S. and across the globe had rallied. Anti-capitalist: Michael Moore made a surprise visit to Occupy Wall Street protesters last night where he said Americans have no say over how the economy is run . Saluting the flag: Occupy Wall Street' demonstrator Zuni Tikka drew the stares in New York's Financial District last night . Moore was especially welcomed by the protesters who are growing increasingly angry at an impressive array of things. First . it was the greedy bankers, then the plunging markets, followed by the . mortgage crisis and even the execution in Georgia of convicted murderer . Troy Davis. Last night the . arrival of Bowling For Columbine director Moore was topped only by one . female protester stripping to her bare chest. Outside Federal Hall: Mr Moores' visit came on the 11th day of protests in Manhattan and after global markets made their strongest gains for two week . Anger: Hundreds of people have joined the demonstration against bank bail outs, the U.S. mortgage crisis and the execution of convicted murderer Troy Davis . His arrival followed the previous day's surge by global . markets, which made some of their biggest gains for two weeks. Those rises continued again today with European markets rose up across the board - London's FTSE closed up 204.68 at 5,294.05. The . Dow Jones industrial average followed the path, shooting up 257.86 points to 11,301.72, thanks mainly to continuing house prices. The Standard . & Poor's 500 rose 26.45 to 1,189.40. The Nasdaq . composite rose 54.05 to 2,570.74. Sycophantic: Mr Moore's appearance came days after he started promoting his new book, described by the New York Times as 'a cabbage rather than a rose' Investors . have been on edge about Europe's debt problems for months. The Dow . plunged 6.4 per cent last week, its biggest drop since the week ended . October 10, 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. The market's volatility has made many . investors nervous. Since the first week of August, the Dow has closed . up or down more than 200 points a total of 16 times. There were only . four swings of 200 points or more in the other seven months of 2011. However, the news of a multi-trillion dollar bailout package to help the defaulting Greeks appears to have settled investors. But it hasn't soothed the mood of Mr Moore and his protesters. The anti-capitalist said: 'These [protesters] and the people across this country . have no say in how our economic system is run. Capitalism destroyed my . town, Flint, Michigan, people have suffered as a result of the greed of . corporations. 'I . have actually done pretty decent [out of capitalism] because people . come see my movies,' he told Fox News, adding: 'I totally reject the . system. A happy day for me is when I will be unemployed.' Mr . Moore recently started promoting his new book, Here Comes Trouble, . which has been panned as being self-aggrandising with New York Times . describing it as 'a cabbage rather than a rose, a tangy ring of bologna . rather than a sirloin.' And that's one of the more favourable reviews. Tools of capitalism: Protesters in Zucotti Park, New York, have taken to the internet and social networking sites to promote their cause and give live feeds . Arab Spring? In some quarters the demonstrations have been compared to the uprisings of Northern Africa . No say: Mr Moore said that protesters and people across America have no say in how the economic system is run . The Sunday Telegraph suggested that even his most ardent fans would struggle to swallow the utter lack of immodesty in the tome.

"Given the intensifying public anger this week at the richest men in America, Rupert Murdoch can’t have been that surprised when he was heckled during a speech by Occupy Wall Street protesters. The News Corp CEO was shouted at during a speech at an education forum in San Francisco, California, by demonstrators who accused him of trying to profit from public education. Activists repeatedly interrupted Mr Murdoch as he gave a keynote speech at a downtown hotel about how technology could help transform the nation's public education system. Taken out: Activist Joe Hill dressed as the 'Count' character from the TV show 'Sesame Street' and was pushed out of the meeting room after yelling sarcastically . Mr Hill yelled: 'Corporations own all the media in the world. Why should they not own all the education as well?' ‘Equality in education, not privatisation!’ one woman shouted as security guards escorted her out of the ballroom of the Palace Hotel, which hosted the National Summit on Education Reform. ‘Corporations own all the media in the world. Why should they not own all the education as well?’ activist Joe Hill yelled sarcastically. Mr Hill, who was dressed as the ‘Count’ character from the TV show ‘Sesame Street,’ was also pushed out of the meeting room. But Mr Murdoch appeared unfazed by the commotion. ‘It's OK, a little controversy makes everything more interesting,’ he said to audience applause before continuing his half-hour speech. Removed: One woman shouted as security guards escorted her out of the ballroom of the Palace Hotel, which hosted the National Summit on Education Reform . About half a dozen hecklers were escorted out of the hotel after they disrupted Mr Murdoch's speech, but said they were not arrested. They joined about two dozen protesters holding signs and chanting ‘Occupy Wall Street! Occupy Sesame Street!’ outside the conference. Mr Hill later accused Mr Murdoch and other corporate leaders of trying to ‘use the economic crisis to further privatise education and divert more public funds into private corporate interests’. Unfazed: News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch smiles as he delivers a keynote address at the National Summit on Education Reform on Friday in San Francisco, California . Mr Murdoch appeared as part of a two-day education forum sponsored by the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a group chaired by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. It champions school vouchers, charter schools, performance pay for teachers and digital learning. ‘We need to tear down an education system designed for the 19th century and replace it with one suited for the 21st,’ Mr Murdoch said during his morning address. ‘You don't get change by plugging in computers at schools designed for the industrial age. You get it by developing technology that rewrites the rules of the game by centring learning around the learner.’ 'Occupy Sesame Street': Occupy Wall Street protesters stage a demonstration outside of the National Summit on Education Reform where Mr Murdoch was delivering a keynote address . Last year, News Corp acquired Wireless Generation, a company based in Brooklyn, New York, that provides software and services to K-12 schools. In August, New York's comptroller rejected a $27million contract with the educational technology company because of the phone-hacking scandal involving News Corp's British newspapers. On Thursday afternoon more than 100 protesters, mostly San Francisco teachers, picketed outside the hotel, protesting Mr Murdoch's presence at the education conference. In July Mr Murdoch was attacked with a custard pie by comedian Jonnie Marbles while giving evidence on hacking to the UK House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.","News Corp CEO heckled during education speech in San Francisco .

"The University of Virginia on Saturday suspended activities at all campus fraternal organizations amid an investigation into a published report in which a student described being sexually assaulted by seven men at a fraternity in 2012. President Teresa Sullivan said in a letter to the university community that the Board of Visitors is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the allegations contained in a Rolling Stone article, along with the university's policies and procedures concerning sexual assaults. Groups of students, faculty, alumni and others will be asked to hold similar discussions. 'In the words of one student who wrote to me this week, `Policy is needed, but people make change,'Sullivan wrote. Students protested against sexual assault and held signs outside the fraternity house Phi Kappa Psi where the alleged incident took place on Saturday.

'We need the collective strength of the members of our community to ensure that we have the best policies.' Sullivan said the suspension of all fraternal groups is effective until Jan. 9. She also has asked Charlottesville police to investigate the alleged rape at the Phi Kappa Psi house. The fraternity has voluntarily surrendered its fraternal agreement with the university. On Friday, Attorney General Mark Herring said the university agreed to withdraw its appointment of former federal judge and prosecutor Mark Filip as independent counsel to investigate how the school responds to rape allegations. In college, Filip was a member of Phi Kappa Psi. Sullivan had said the Rolling Stone article includes details that weren't disclosed to university officials previously. 'I write you in great sorrow, great rage, but most importantly, with great determination,' Sullivan wrote. 'Meaningful change is necessary, and we can lead that change for all universities. We can demand that incidents like those described in Rolling Stone never happen and that if they do, the responsible are held accountable to the law. This will require institutional change, cultural change, and legislative change, and it will not be easy. We are making those changes.' promising change: University of Virginia President, Teresa Sullivan says that she is dedicated to making meaningful changes in the university's response to sexual assault .

"A 12-year-old boy is fighting for his life after being shot by a  police officer when he allegedly pulled a BB gun from his waistband outside a recreation center in Cleveland. The unnamed youngster was spotted 'waving around' the airsoft gun in the playground area next to Cuddell Recreation Center at Detroit Avenue and West Boulevard at around 3.30pm on Saturday. A concerned man, who was sat nearby, called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy in here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody. 'The guy keeps pulling it in and out…it’s probably fake, but he’s scaring the s*** out of people.' Shooting: An unnamed 12-year-old boy is in a serious condition after being shot by a police officer when he allegedly pulled this BB (airsoft) gun (pictured) from his waistband outside a recreation center in Cleveland . cene: The youngster was spotted 'waving around' the airsoft gun in the playground area next to Cuddell Recreation Center (pictured) at around 3.30pm on Saturday. Above, police are pictured at the scene . Minutes later, two Cleveland Police officers - a rookie and a 10-15 year veteran - arrived at the scene, where they apparently saw the boy pick up the gun from a table and put it in his waistband. The rookie then asked the boy to put his hands up, at which point the youngster reached into his waistband and pulled out the pistol,  Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer said. Despite the 911 caller's prior warning that the gun was likely fake, the officer then fired two shots at the boy, at least one of which hit him in the stomach, according to Cleveland.com. The victim was rushed to MetroHealth Medical Center, where he underwent surgery on Saturday evening. He is believed to remain in a critical condition. Distraught: One of the boy's relatives is pictured weeping on the ground after hearing of Saturday's shooting . Scene: A concerned bystander called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy in here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody.' Above, Cuddell Recreation Center . Police later told Fox 8 the weapon the boy was carrying was 'an airsoft type replica gun resembling a semi-automatic pistol.' They added that the gun's orange safety indicator had been removed. Union officials claimed the officers - one of whom was later taken to hospital with an ankle injury - acted responsibly amid concerns the boy was in possession of a real gun. However, Deputy Chief of Field Operations Ed Tomba described the incident as 'very, very tragic', saying that the child did not threaten the officer verbally or physically. 'When an officer gives a command, we expect it to be followed,' Mr Tomba said. 'The way it looks like right now, it wasn't followed, but we're going to continue our investigation.' Response: Two Cleveland Police officers arrived at the scene following the 911 call. After the boy refused to put his hands up and reached for the gun (pictured from another perspective), one officer fired at him twice . On Saturday evening, members of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office were at the scene. Investigators will determine if the officer was justified in shooting the boy. According to the boy's mother, Samaria Rice, the family lives across the street from the recreation center, which is expected to remain cordoned off on Sunday. She told Action News 19 the first she heard of the shooting was when two  men came to her home to say her son had been shot. She added that her son did not have access to a gun at the property. Both officers involved are believed to have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with protocol in officer-involved shooting incidents. An investigation is ongoing.

"When inventor Roger Sawyer created his 'Emdrive' concept in 2000, everyone laughed at his design. Nasa claimed the quantum vacuum plasma thruster went against the laws of physics, as did many others in the scientific community. But now the space agency has found out that the fuel-free space drive, once described as 'impossible', actually works - it is just not sure why. Scroll down for video . When inventor Roger Sawyer created his 'Emdrive' concept (pictured) in 2000, everyone laughed at his design.Nasa claimed the quantum vacuum plasma thruster went against the laws of physics, as did many others in the scientific community . The finding could bring human deep space travel a step closer as well as reducing the cost and size of satellites. The engine, called EmDrive, is relatively simple. It provides thrust to a spacecraft by bouncing microwaves around in a closed container. Solar energy provides the electricity to power the microwaves, which means that no propellant is needed. The implications for this could be huge. For instance, current satellites could be half the size they are today without the need to carry fuel. Solar energy provides the electricity to power the microwaves, which means that no propellant is needed.The implications for this could be huge. For instance, current satellites could be half the size they are today without the need to carry fuel . Humans could also travel further into space, generating their own propulsion on the way. When London-based Sawyer came up with concept, the only team that took him seriously was a group of Chinese scientists. In 2009, the team allegedly produced 720 millinewton (or 72g) of thrust, enough to build a satellite thruster. But still, nobody believed they had achieved this. Now Pennsylvania-based scientist Guido Fetta and his team at Nasa Eagleworks have published a paper that demonstrates that a similar engine works on the same principles. Their model, dubbed Cannae Drive, produces much less thrust at 30 to 50 micronewtons - less than a thousandth of the output of some relatively low-powered ion thrusters used today. Nasa is yet to explain why its engine works. This could mean that either the results are wrong, or the space agency has confirmed a breakthrough in space propulsion. A functioning man-made leaf that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, just like natural leaves, has been created by an art graduate. The new material could provide a steady source of oxygen for humans on long missions in space and even help us colonise new planets. Julian Melchiorri claims that the leaves could also transform life on Earth as we know it, because buildings could be clad with the material to oxygenate homes and polluted urban areas. The Royal College of Art graduate told Dezeen that Nasa is researching ways to ensure a supply of oxygen over long journeys so that people can live in space, but that plants don't grow in zero gravity. This material could allow us to explore space much further than we can now,' he said. Mr Melchiorri claims that he has made the 'first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does.' Mr Melchiorri says that his material consumes very little energy and as a result he thinks it could be incorporated into modern buildings, to absorb carbon dioxide. It could be used to clad facades, ventilation systems, he said. 'You can absorb air from outside, pass it through these biological filters and then bring oxygenated air inside.'","Concept for the spacedrive was put forward by Roger Sawyer in 2000 .

"Financial setbacks: Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky left an estate worth nothing in the UK . Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky left an estate worth nothing in the UK after he was found hanged in mysterious circumstances. The former tycoon, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, was once known as Russia’s second richest man, worth £1.9 billion. He was found dead in March last year in a bathroom at his ex-wife’s £20 million home in Ascot, Berkshire, after a series of financial setbacks. His family do not believe he killed himself, and a coroner recorded an open verdict. Probate records reveal that he died without a will and left an estate valued at 'nil' in England and Wales. It is not known if he had assets held overseas or in trust or joint-ownership which would not have been included in his estate. His daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya claimed at a two day inquest in Windsor last March that the Russian Government could have been behind his death. A German forensic scientist, acting for his family, who examined autopsy photographs, said he did not believe Berezovsky had killed himself. But police found no evidence of foul play and the inquest heard how he had spoken of suicide before his death. Another scientist also concluded he had not been murdered. The Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford recorded an open verdict, but said there was 'compelling evidence' of suicide due to Berezovsky's depression and financial problems. The former tycoon, also known as Platon Elenin, lost a London High Court battle with Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea football club owner, just seven months before his death. He lost a £1.8billion damages claim over rightful ownership of the oil group Sibneft and was also left with an estimated £100million legal bill.

"A stunning luxury boat has combined the worlds of marine and aviation design by using an engine that originally powered an iconic British warplane. The £3million Aeroboat is propelled by a reconditioned, waterproofed 27-litre Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine. It’s the same engine that fitted to Britain’s Spitfire fighter plane during the Second World War. The aircraft also provided styling inspiration for the boat. The £3million Aeroboat is propelled by a reconditioned, waterproofed 27-litre Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine - the engine used in the RAF Spitfire . The Spitfire symbolises the Battle of Britain and has an aura of mystique in the world of aviation . Just 10 Aeroboats with 1,100 horsepower on tap, able to propel the vessel to a top speed of between 75 and 95 knots, or 86-109 miles per hour, have been built. The vessel was created by Hampshire-based yacht design studio Claydon Reeves. The boat is sculpted in carbon fiber Kevlar and lightweight wood veneer to keep the weight down and ensure it rides the waves with ease. Each of the reconditioned Aeroboat engines will come with 'documented provenance' of its history. Soaring: With 1,100 horsepower on tap, the vessel can hit a top speed of between 75 and 95 knots, or 86-109 miles per hour . Interior: The plush fittings in the Aeroboat are a far cry from the stark functionality of the Spitfire's cockpit . The vessel was created by Hampshire-based yacht design studio Claydon Reeves . A scale model will be unveiled at the Salute to Style show in London on July 16. A Claydon Reeves spokesman said: 'The Aeroboat is one of the fastest and most elegant small yachts ever produced. Length overall: 14.64m . Beam: 2.98m . Max draft: 1.14m . Weight: 7700kg . Passengers: Seven (max) Power: 1,600-2,100hp . Maximum speed: 75-95 knots (86-109mph) 'It is perfect for anyone wanting to breakfast in St Tropez, lunch in Antibes and dine at night in Monaco. 'Inspired by the sleek lines of the famous Spitfire fighter, from the stern and sweeping tail echoing the wing’s trailing edge to the authentic air intake scoop, the Aeroboat’s throttle and switchgear design is aircraft-inspired and the shock-mounted forward seats are a nod to the Spitfire’s own landing gear.' It also features aircraft-inspired switchgear and shock-mounted seats into its long, sleek form. Salute to Style is a celebration of speed on water, air and road tpo be held at London”s Hurlingham Club between July 16 and 19. The Aeroboat will be built to customer specifications with every element of its interior design, from the cockpit to trim, engine specifications and exterior finishes, configured to suit its owner.","The design of the £3m Aeroboat has also been inspired by the iconic plane .

He wanted the ‘reverse offering’ to teach churchgoers that faith in God - not government - is the only route out of the current financial crisis. ‘The success of this effort comes from empowering people to be the solution, instead of expecting the government to do it,’ Pastor Lucas said. ‘We're hoping this fosters an outbreak of generosity, that people creatively invest the money in good works to make themselves and their community better. ‘We believe the economic crisis is a spiritual issue, which is why we are moving forward with God's recovery plan.’ Big idea: Lead pastor Tim Lucas said they had no problems and there were not hordes of people who just came looking for free money .

'We're . hoping this fosters an outbreak of generosity, that people creatively . invest the money in good works to make themselves and their community . better' Pastor Tim Lucas . Parishioners appeared to take the ‘do good deeds’ message to heart. ‘I think this is a fabulous idea,’ said Michelle Clifford of North Caldwell, who recently began attending . services at the church. She got an envelope with $10, which she planned to return to the church. Ms Clifford said she was so inspired by the message that she would donate clothes and $20 of her own money to a local homeless shelter. Collection basket: Officials at the Liquid Church say they had heard of a church in California trying a similar 'reverse collection' tactic . ‘They took a strong step of faith which shows people that church isn't all about the money, it's about touching hearts,’ Ms Clifford said. Liquid Church was first set up as a Bible class with 12 people in 1999, before they launched as an official church in 2007. Now about 2,000 people attend at three locations. ‘And that's what I saw today, a lot of people feeling blessed, excited about doing good things with the money they got.’ Church officials say they had heard of a church in California trying a similar ‘reverse collection’ tactic. They thought it was a good idea at a time when so many people are struggling financially. Collection: The church wanted the idea to teach churchgoers that faith in God - not government - is the only route out of the current financial crisis . ‘The national economy might be in the . ditch, but at the end of the day, your personal economy is what . matters,’ Pastor Rich Birch said. 'They took a strong step of faith . which shows people that church isn't all about the money, it's about . touching hearts' Churchgoer Michelle Clifford . ‘The Bible teaches simplicity and living within your means, and that God gives us resources and trusts us to use them. ‘So in a real way it's saying God trusts us. It's a bit of a teaching metaphor, and when we literally give them money, it's saying God trusts us to use it properly.’ One churchgoer said she planned to use her money to buy cake supplies to bake goods for a fundraiser for flooding victims.

"Charged: Ian Ball, the day after he ambushed the Princess's car en route to Buckingham Palace . The fanatical loner who tried to kidnap Princess Anne believed he ought to be thanked for highlighting serious flaws in Royal security. Ian Ball, who ambushed the Princess’s car en route to Buckingham Palace on March 20, 1974, said the police realising that the Royal Family needed better security was the ‘one good thing’ to come out of his ‘audacious’ crime. Ball seeks to justify his actions in police files which were supposed to remain classified until 2048 but which have been obtained by The Mail on Sunday following a seven-month Freedom of Information battle. In his interrogation after being arrested, the then 26-year-old told police: ‘I suppose I’ll be locked up for the rest of my life. I am only sorry I frightened Princess Anne. There is one good thing coming out of this: you will have to improve on her protection.’ The interview transcript provides new insights into a crime that shocked Britain. Princess Anne was 23 and had celebrated her marriage to first husband Captain Mark Phillips only months before. The couple were returning from a charity event when Ball used his Ford Escort to force their car to stop on The Mall. Ball shot and wounded the Princess’s driver Alexander Callender and Inspector James Beaton, a Royal protection officer whose gun jammed as he confronted the attacker. Ball demanded that the Princess get out of the car but she told him: ‘Not bloody likely.’ The would-be kidnapper told police that he thought she would be an easy target and that he had learned her movements simply by telephoning the Buckingham Palace press office. He said: ‘I had thought about it for years… She would have been the easiest. I have seen her riding with her husband.’ Drama: The confrontation on March 20 1974, as reconstructed in the 2006 film To Kidnap A Princess . Ambush: Ball's white Ford and the car in which Princess Anne was travelling on the night of the ambush . Front page: How the next morning's Daily Mail reported Ball's failed attempt to kidnap Princess Anne . Before his arrest, he also shot Brian McConnell, a journalist who tried to help the Princess, and constable Michael Hills. The files reveal that Ball showed no remorse for wounding the four men. In the limelight: Princess Anne and Mark Phillips at their 1973 wedding . He said: ‘They were getting in my way so I had to shoot them. Well, the police, that’s their job. They expect to be shot. I took a chance of getting shot so why shouldn’t they?’ Ball had planned to take the Princess to a Central London property which he had rented under an alias, and to demand a ransom of £3 million. Detectives initially feared Ball was part of the IRA but he told officers: ‘I have got no friends. I’m a loner. I put a lot of thought and work into it. ‘I can’t expect people like you to understand or accept that I did it and planned it alone. Do you think I am part of the IRA or something? If there had been anyone else they would have helped me at the scene.’ He also told police: ‘I knew [Beaton] would be armed. If his gun had not jammed, I would be dead.’ The Princess’s car was unaccompanied because police did not think the Royal Family was a target. But Ball’s actions led to a major overhaul of security arrangements for all VIPs. Mr Beaton, who was awarded a George Cross for his bravery, last night said: ‘I am not surprised about the lack of remorse because he was mentally ill. But in a sense his comments about Royal security were right. Nobody expected anything like that to happen, not even with the IRA. ‘We took precautions but nothing like you have today. I was walking past the door at the wrong time and they said, “We want someone to help with the Royal protection team,” and that was it. There were no interviews or training.’ Ball pleaded guilty to kidnap and attempted murder. He was committed to a mental hospital and is believed to be currently in Broadmoor.","Ian Ball ambushed Anne's car en route to Buckingham Palace in 1974 .

"Everton are considering a bid for Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis after Romelu Lukaku injured his ankle against Liverpool on Tuesday night. The influential Belgian has damaged his ligaments and faces three to four weeks on the sidelines. They need another strike option as Lacina Traore is still some way off with his hamstring injury and Arouna Kone is out for most of the season. Wishlist: Everton could launch a move for Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) before the window closes . Blow: Everton want to sign a new striker after Romelu Lukaku was injured against Liverpool . Click here to read Part I of the Transfer Column . France centre forward Gomis is a long-time target of Newcastle but they grew tired of negotiating for the 28-year-old and have switched their attention to midfield and Clement Grenier to replace Yohan Cabaye. Lyon need the money but Gomis is out of contract in the summer and ready to leave after enduring a strained relationship with the club. Everton ideally want younger players but, if Lyon can be tempted with a bid of around £3million, they may be able to reach an agreement. Manager Roberto Martinez also remains keen to bring in another defensive midfielder on loan from abroad. He had designs on Gueida Fofana from Lyon but they are not prepared to deal with Grenier’s pending move and Arsenal considering Yoan Gourcuff as an alternative to other plans. West Bromwich Albion are looking at a diverse set of targets as they look to replace Shane Long. Chief scout Stuart White watched Leeds United against Leicester at the weekend and was at Burnley against Brighton on Tuesday night. In demand: West Brom and Sunderland are among the clubs interested in Ross McCormack . Ross McCormack is understood to be the object of his attention on Saturday while Burnley’s Danny Ings was the target at Turf Moor. They have made an enquiry for Valencia’s 29-year-old forward Jonas but, as West Ham found out earlier this month, he will struggle to gain a work permit as he does not have a dual passport and has not played the necessary games for Brazil. Albion have also asked about Espanyol’s Thievy Bifouma, as have Leicester City, while QPR target Ishak Belfodil of Inter Milan has been offered on loan, as has former Manchester City striker Rolando Bianchi, now 30 and at Torino. Belfodil was in the stands at Loftus Road on Tuesday night. His deal there has fallen through over terms of a proposed permanent deal but he is open to joining an English club until May. Seeking a move: Ishak Belfodil (right) has seen a move to QPR fall through but is still keen to come to England . Albion have a large squad and could still take offers for Nicolas Anelka while Markus Rosenberg is still expected to join Malmo. Offers have been made from Turkish sides for Diego Lugano but Pepe Mel sees the Uruguayan as someone who can help get his message across to the other players and he will stay. Midfielder George Thorne is likely to join Derby County on loan later on Wednesday. West Ham have been criticised by the sporting director of La Liga club Osasuna over the proposed transfer of Raoul Loe that failed to materialise last week. The Hammers had moved to sign the Cameroon defensive midfielder but backed out at the last minute after becoming aware that they could definitely sign Antonio Nocerino from AC Milan. It left 24-year-old Loe ‘sorely disappointed’. Vasiljevic said: ‘I cannot understand how a club at that level can negotiate and work in a two-faced way like that. Raoul had a bad Saturday night.’ West Ham believe it was more misleading information from the agents involved but there will be a few more upset players like that this week as clubs and agents adopt an almost scatter-gun approach across Europe. New arrivals: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce with Marco Borriello (left) and Antonio Nocerino . Wigan fear they will miss out on Hull City’s Jack Hobbs as Nottingham Forest seem to be in pole position. Leicester are also lurking with Fulham poised to bid again for the injured Liam Moore but Hull manager Steve Bruce said: ‘I would expect Jack to go. We have accepted a bid from Forest, we have accepted a bid from Wigan and we have accepted a bid from Reading, so I would expect him by Friday to take up one of those options.’ With that in mind, Wigan have considered Bolton target Craig Dawson as a loan from West Brom but are now leaning towards a move for former New York Red Bulls defender Markus Holgersson. The 28-year-old Swedish man is a free agent after failing to take up a new deal at Red Bulls for the new season. Sunderland have also expressed an interest in Ross McCormack. Manager Gus Poyet has been offered deals for Tomane from Guimaraes and Valencia winger Andres Guardado but is reluctant to bring in too many more foreign players. He remains keen on bringing in Liam Bridcutt from Brighton which may entail Connor Wickham going the other way. Swap deal: Liam Bridcutt (left) could join Sunderland from Brighton with Connor Wickham going the other way . Losing McCormack would be a blow to Leeds and manager Brian McDermott. West Ham are unlikely now to make a renewed bid but West Brom have watched him too. McDermott fears the 27-year-old may be sold as Leeds’ prospective new owners continue to jostle for position. The Italian consortium led by Cagliari’s Massimo Cellino were not seen at Elland Road on Tuesday night despite being expected. Their move on Leeds is being heralded in Italy as a chance for Cagliari playmaker Andrea Tabanelli to move to Yorkshire on loan for the rest of the season. That news has not gone down too well with some playing staff, who fear more Italians could follow if that buy-out goes through.","Everton are considering a bid for Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis .

"A 26-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly stripping naked, falling through a ceiling into a women's bathroom and assaulting an 84-year-old man in a bizarre rampage at a Boston airport. Cameron Shenk reportedly stripped inside one of the stalls in the bathroom at Logan International Airport on Saturday, before leaving his clothes on the floor and climbing into a dropped ceiling. He then crashed through the ceiling, suffering cuts to his head and body, and attacked an elderly man while he was still naked and bleeding, leaving the pensioner with serious injuries, it is claimed.

"A former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby bed after the comediam gave her a sedative after complaining of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. Hours later she was in bed with one of the 77-year-old's acquaintances. Scroll down for video . Spiking allegations: Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s . Aftermath: She described how the comedian told her the pill would be 'a little strong', then hours after she took it, she woke up naked in bed alongside one of Cosby's friends . When he gave her the substance, she claims Cosby told her it was a 'little strong', but it it caused her to black out. She added that, even though she never saw Cosby drink or take drugs, he had a drawer full of pills. Emmons, who was born in Brooklyn, said women would sometimes take the drugs 'knowingly or voluntarily' while men partied after taking them. She claims Cosby drugged her, but has not accused him of sexual assault. Quaalude, which is also referred to as Methaqualone - a sedative-hypnotic substance that acts as a depressant to the central nervous system. It was used in the 1970s as a muscle relaxant and as a cure for insomnia. It is still believed to be used as a recreational drug around the world. Emmons' claims are similar to many others made by women against the comedian. Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions. Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. Supplies: Emmons said that she never saw Cosby drink or do drugs, but claims he still had a 'drawer full of pills' at his disposal . Another four women; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Lawyers for Cosby have dismissed all the claims as untrue while the star has refused to make any comment. Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has released a statement calling recent rape allegations 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical.' 'This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards,' says Singer. 'Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?' He then closes by saying, 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.'","Joyce Emmons said comedian slipped her substance in the 1970s .

"A crazed gunman was shot dead  after he went on a deadly rampage, setting fire to his house, then fatally shooting a sheriff's deputy and wounding another when they arrived to tackle the blaze. The man, who has not been named, was killed by a Tallahassee police officer who lived nearby. He heard the shooting, threw on his bullet-proof vest, grabbed his gun and ran toward the house. Crime scene: Heavily-armed law enforcement officers stand at the site where a man set his house on fire and then fatally shot a sheriff's deputy and wounded another responding to the scene . Lt. James McQuaig of the Leon County Sheriff's Office said deputies and firefighters responded to the blaze about 10:15 a.m. But as the first deputy approached the house, the man opened fire and he was fatally shot. The gunman then picked up the deputy's gun, walked down the street and used it to shoot a second deputy before he was fatally shot by other law enforcement officers, McQuaig said. The wounded Deputy credits his vest for saving his life and his injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Police have not yet released the name of the gunman who was killed, or the names of the wounded deputies. However, the fire has been extinguished and crime scene investigators were seen going in and out of the house. The house blaze was set near a gray and white house which sits on a corner in a middle-class neighborhood just outside the Tallahassee city limits. Property records show it was purchased in 2012 for $128,000. The shooting comes just days after a police shootout at Florida State University left a gunman dead after he wounded two students and an employee. Myron May, 31, an FSU alumnus, showed signs of mental health issues months before he opened fire at a campus library early Thursday.","The man has not been named but was killed by a Tallahassee police officer .

"A cereal fan has spent a staggering £36,800 tasting cornflakes in 60 countries - in search of the perfect bowlful.

However, some cheaper, paler brands - mostly found in Asia and Africa - have tasted 'more like cardboard, and gone limp’, once soaked in milk.

'I thought my idea was the perfect way to combine my two passions. 'Thankfully, it has not been too difficult finding cornflakes in shops around the world as they are a basic cereal.

'However, some have been very disappointing. 'The cheaper ones have been pumped with air, looked pale, and taste more like paper or cardboard. 'They also go limp in milk. There is quite a clear divide between quality of cornflakes in the developed and developing world. 'I had to use varying amount of sugar to try and give some of the poorer flakes some flavour. 'That also gave me some of the energy I needed to cycle throughout the day.' 'The quality of the milk and the surroundings can also influence how much I enjoy my bowlful.

"It’s a question men often ponder as they talk to females on the phone: ‘Is this woman as attractive as she sounds?’ Now scientists claim to have found the answer: she probably is. Women who sound sexy tend to have more feminine faces – with higher cheekbones, softer jawlines and fuller lips – than those with more humdrum voices, academics have discovered. Look as good they sound: Presenter Mariella Frostrup, left, and actress Scarlett Johansson, right, are famous for their sultry voices . And their faces are usually symmetrical, a telltale sign in both sexes of good genes. It means there is good reason why women with famously sultry voices, like broadcaster Mariella Frostrup and actress Scarlett Johansson look as attractive as they sound. Scientists at Austria’s University of Vienna believe men have evolved to use the sound of a woman’s voice as a ‘back-up signal’ to better gauge how fertile they are. Writing in the journal Evolution And Human Behaviour, they said relying on more than one indicator – in other words, both sight and sound – ‘ensures a low rate of mate choice error’. They photographed 42 female students, most in their 20s, as well as recording their voices, spoken in a normal manner. They found those women who sounded attractive to a panel of men also tended to be so in the flesh. They had smaller faces, their eyes were further apart, and they had smaller noses and chins, and larger lips. Somewhat unromantically, Dr Peter Abend, who led the research, said what men were hearing in an attractive woman’s voice was the fact that her vocal cords, larynx and nasal cavity were well aligned. Consequently, an attractive voice gave away the fact that a woman had a symmetrical face.","Women who sound sexy have more feminine faces, researchers say .

"Object of desire: David Gandy in his M&S advert . When John Prescott revealed he had bulimia, the world laughed. Yes, eating disorders are funny. Who knew? The former Deputy Prime Minister had revealed his struggle, no doubt hoping to help others blighted by the condition. But one award-winning political commentator declared a misdiagnosis, saying Prescott was ‘more likely just a greedy incompetent, who gobbled every treat going’. This wasn’t an isolated jibe. Feminist website Jezebel produced a What Prezza Was Eating… Daily Guidelines For Men – complete with fat and carbohydrate content. Would women be spoken about like this? Would it be tolerated? No way. I thought back to Prescott’s revelation in 2008 during the recent uproar over Victoria’s Secret, which launched an advertising campaign called The Perfect Body, showcasing the variety of underwear it sells. Women were outraged, it seems, because all the models were lithe and toned. US advertising trade publication Adweek reported that within days of posters going up, 10,000 people had signed a petition demanding the company ‘apologise for and amend the irresponsible marketing of your new bra range’. Complainants said the advert played on women’s insecurities, sent out damaging messages, and failed to celebrate diversity. Can you imagine if men made a similar response to the David Gandy posters for Marks & Spencer? Many of the same women who later went on to denounce Victoria’s Secret used their newspaper columns to leer at the images in ways that would make a builder blush. ‘Well done M&S on that autumn ad campaign. I’ve spent most of the past fortnight alternately lusting over David Gandy in his pants and that orange coat. But mainly David Gandy,’ said one. A broadsheet interviewer spent an entire article making jokes such as: ‘I’ve just buried my face in David Gandy’s underpants… it was heaven.’ And one famous feminist added: ‘It’s nice to see that objectification sometimes runs both ways.’ Uproar: When Victoria's Secret launched a campaign called The Perfect 'Body', women were outraged . But a diet of David Beckham and Gandy, or whichever Hollywood muscle man of the moment is gracing the cover of Men’s Health, is unarguably as damaging to male self-perception as The Perfect Body is to females. More than 1.6million Britons suffer an eating disorder, ten per cent of whom are men. We have to contend with ‘bigorexia’, which sees men pump their bodies with hormones and protein shakes to get a bigger chest and arms. One leading rugby coach told me that anabolic steroid abuse was endemic among teenage players, desperate to emulate the muscular physiques of their sporting heroes. And at least two British teenage boys have died over the past few years after taking the banned slimming pill called DNP. One was apparently trying to get a ‘six-pack’. Ultimately, there is a wider malaise surrounding male health in general. Not only is there a lack of empathy for our health concerns, there is also a lack of medical care. For example, women are screened for breast, ovarian and cervical cancer, which is great. But there’s no screening programme for prostate cancer, even though it kills four times more men than cervical cancer does women. Ridiculed: Labour peer John Prescott revealed he had bulimia in 2008 . Research from Cancer Research UK illustrates that men are 16 per cent more likely to develop every form of unisex cancer in the first place, then 40 per cent more likely to die from it. Despite cases of oral cancer having risen by 50 per cent among UK men since 1989 – accounting for almost 2,000 deaths annually – there is no vaccination for young men against HPV, which causes it. Between 2007 and 2012, NHS Primary Care Trusts in the London boroughs of Haringey, Hammersmith and Fulham, Brent and Camden ‘spent £4,830,095 commissioning women’s services outside the NHS… and nothing on men’s’. It’s a trend that is visible nationally, with female care almost constantly ranked above that of men. Rather than being the subject of sympathetic public concern or the odd fundraising gala, men are repeatedly told it’s all their fault. But in truth, men aren’t dying sooner because they’re ignorant or proud. When men don’t discuss their health concerns it’s not because they’re wired this way – it’s because if they say anything, they’ll be greeted with shaming tactics to stop them, just like Prescott. I shall leave it to Dr Timothy Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at London’s King’s College, to summarise: ‘Compared to women, men have shorter markers of longevity, called telomeres – suggesting there’ll always be a biological difference [which justifies the need for men to get greater care]. The state needs to realise men are discriminated against by the set-up of the current UK system.’ I couldn’t have said it better myself. Stand By Your Manhood, by Peter Lloyd, is published this week by Biteback, priced £16.99.","When John Prescott revealed he suffered from bulimia, he was ridiculed .

"Entrepreneur Jessica Furtado has set tails wagging after launching her own fashion line for pug dogs. The 22-year-old's hand knitted hats and costumes have been designed for those wishing to dress the dogs up as characters such as a ladybird, an alien, an aviator, Batman and even Minnie Mouse. The English student has also launched a range of stylish knitted bow ties, French berets and neck warmers.

The Snuggly Pug Alien hat was such a hit with fellow pug owners she founded her company All You Need is Pug while still studying for her university degree. She now sells the hats for between £11 and £20. Ms Furtado said: 'During the winter our clothing provides warmth and comfort especially for pugs, bulldogs, Boston terriers and other breeds whose bodies are low to the ground. 'Pugs in particular are sensitive to extreme heat and extreme cold so they require their owners to be aware of the weather and to take precautions.

'Other hats are inspired by history and fashion, such as the iconic aviator helmet or the cabbie cap which resembles old fashioned ""newsboy"" hats. 'In my experience, most dogs enjoy dressing up now and then whether it is because they feel comfortable or because they notice the doting attention that they receive from humans when they wear clothing.'","Jessica Furtado set up company after knitting hat for her adopted pug .

"A love story worthy of Downton Abbey has been revealed after a piece of mysterious graffiti was deciphered after more than 100 years. The phrase 'essere amato amando' was scratched into a window at historic Penrhyn Castle in north Wales, and for years experts believed it was nothing more than a jumble of Latin words. But it has now emerged that the graffiti was in fact a heartfelt plea by a thwarted lover - thought to have been an aristocratic teenager who was pining after the estate's gardener. Mystery solved: This graffiti reading 'essere amato amando' had baffled experts for decades . Tryst: The words appear result from a forbidden romance involving Alice Douglas-Pennant . Striking: The story is similar to a story in Downton Abbey which sees Lord Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville, right) have an affair with a maid . The words have long been dismissed as . a meaningless scrawl, but an Italian working at the castle said he . thought he could understand what it was saying. Resi . Tomat, the institution's education manager, revealed that the phrase . was in fact garbled Italian and meant: 'To be loved while loving'. Historians think the words were etched on the glass by The Hon Alice Douglas-Pennant, known locally as 'Lady Alice'. She . is said to have fallen in love with a gardener and been banished to the . castle tower by her father, wealthy industrialist and Conservative MP . Lord Penrhyn. The romantic message in the window pane . has become a hit with visitors to the castle, which is now owned by the . National Trust and open to the public. The story which appears to be behind it . is reminiscent of a storyline in hit ITV show Downton Abbey, in which . the Earl of Grantham has an illicit affair with his maid, crossing class . boundaries. Home: Lady Alice apparently pined after a gardener at Penrhyn Castle, pictured, in north Wales . Patriarch: It was the second Lord Penrhyn who apparently shut up his daughter in her room . House steward Clare Turgoose said that workers at the castle had long puzzled over the graffiti. But Mr Tomat was able to recognise the language it was written in and translate it into English, she said. 'We knew the room had once been Lady Alice's bedroom, because she had scratched her name on another window pane. So it was fair to assume that the writing was probably hers and we began to dig a little. 'We kept coming across the same story - that as a young woman Lady Alice had fallen for one of the castle staff, possibly a gardener.' Attraction: The window with the graffiti scratched into it has become popular with tourists . That liaison could explain why the girl was forced to spend so much time cooped up in her room, Ms Turgoose said. 'It was not just on that the daughter of a lord should fraternise with an employee. It was a Downton Abbey situation where the two just don't mingle socially. 'The story goes that he forced her to stay in the nursery to keep her away from her love.' The message in the window is believed to date to around 1880, and National Trust staff are currently doing research to try and corroborate the romantic tale attributed to it. Lady Alice was one of 15 children brought up in the neo-Norman castle set in countryside between Snowdonia and Menai Strait. She never married and died in London in 1939 at the age of 76. Four years ago, an exhibition of her watercolours was put on at Penrhyn, revealing her previously unexpected artistic talents. The fate of the gardener she was in love with is unknown. Aristocracy: Downton Abbey has lifted the lid on the lives of the upper classes in Lady Alice's time .","Graffiti reading 'essere amato amando' baffled experts for decades .

"A bald middle-aged New York mechanic was fired from his job and claims it was because he turned down sexual advances from his married boss. Robert Inchierchiro, 53, was working at a vocational school called Nassau BOCES in Long Island where he claims to have been fired by his boss Lisa Rice for not giving in to her persistent seduction. The New York Post reports that Inchierchiro also made a Division of Human Rights complaint against two other female bosses who supposedly teased him for turning down Rice's advances. Fired: Robert Inchierchiro pictured here with a friend claims he was fired for turning down his married boss' persistent sexual advances at the vocational school where he worked . He also claims that his bosses terrorized his girlfriend Vanessa out of spite and jealousy. The Post reports that Rice was Inchierchiro's supervisor for a year before he started dating Vanessa and that when he  entered the new romantic relationship, Rice's behavior spun out of control. Rice, 50, and another boss, Louise Flynn, 58, allegedly visited Vanessa at the Jericho Public Library where she worked, and asked for someone named 'Natasha,' the complaint says. Vanessa told the women there was no one working there by that name and so the women said, I'm sorry, we meant Vanessa.' Vanessa said that she was the person they were looking for and that's when the women introduced themselves as Bob's co-workers. 'My client was courageous to stand up to sexual harassment in the workplace,' said his lawyer, David Rosenberg. 'We are seeing more female-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace.' Fired for dignity?: Robert Inchierchiro filed a sexual-harassment complaint this week against Nassau BOCES, a vocational school where he says he was fired for rejecting married supervisor Lisa Rice's come-ons . The Post reports that in August, Rice allegedly bought Inchierchiro a ticket for a 'work related' cruise and told him Vanessa could come but she would have to buy her own ticket. Rice then supposedly asked Inchierchiro to drive her to the event but Inchierchiro told Rice he'd have to 'get back to her' because driving her would imply it was a 'date.' 'Bob, uncomfortable with . . . Lisa’s jealousy of Vanessa . . . told Lisa that he would have to get back to her,' says the filing. Rice then allegedly told Inchierchiro she was too sick to go on the cruise so he invited a guy friend instead. Despite saying she was sick, Rice supposedly showed up at Inchierchiro's doorstep dressed up for the event and asked Vanessa if 'Bob was ready to go on the cruise.' She allegedly exclaimed, 'How could you do this to me? You know I got all dolled up! Why would you go without me?' in front of Vanessa. The Monday after the cruise, Inchierchiro was allegedly confronted by his supervisor  Lori Rowcroft, 57, for going on the cruise with a friend instead of with Rice and demanded he apologize. The filing states he called Rice who said, 'I can’t believe you’d do this. How dare you!' Rice banned Inchierchiro from future events and said that he botched a new GPS system and he was put on paid leave. Alter complaining to a supervisor, he was fired.","Robert Inchierchiro, 53, was working at a vocational school where he claims to have been fired by his married boss Lisa Rice .

"A landowner is selling one of the Lake District's most famous peaks for £1.75m - and is hoping 'some daft Russian' will come along and take it off his hands. Lord Hugh Lowther, the eight Earl of Lonsdale, is flogging the 3,000ft Blencathra mountain in a bid to pay off a £9m inheritance bill. But the 64-year-old, who lives there with his third wife Lady Elizabeth, admits he needs some 'show off' to buy the iconic peak - because any prospective buyer won't be able to do anything with it. Lord Hugh Lowther, the eighth Earl of Lonsdale, pictured with his wife Lady Elizabeth, is selling Blencathra mountain in the Lake District for £1.75m . The iconic mountain, commonly known as the Saddleback, is being sold - complete with a ceremonial lordship - to help pay off a £9m inheritance tax bill . Speaking to the Telegraph, Lord Lonsdale said: 'Who's got the money? We know the Chinese have got it, and the Russians . have got it. 'We're hoping there will be some daft Russian (who wants . it) to show off.' The aristocrat, whose family has owned the peak for 400 years, has already sold a Turner painting, a derelict farm standing and a couple of vacant cottages to try and reduce his inheritance tax bill. But with just 18 months to pay every penny, Lord Lonsdale decided it was time to sell the peak - with a ceremonial lordship title chucked in for free. Despite its stark beauty and prime location, Lord Lonsdale knows selling the peak will be hard work. As it is part of the Lake District National Park, which is in Cumbria, any buyer will be unable to develop or build on the peak. Lord Lonsdale, 64, said he can think of 'better things to spend his money on' but hopes 'some daft Russian' will want the mountain so they can 'show off' The new owner will also be unable to do anything about the thousands of walkers who cross the peak each year. Lord Lonsdale admits he can 'think . of better things' to spend his money on, but hopes an extravagant international might feel otherwise. If his wish for a 'daft Russian' does not come true, Lord Lonsdale hopes the government or . National Trust will step in instead. He told the paper: 'Once the duties are gone, I can have a better way of life. I can . go and buy myself a super yacht in the south of France or a house in . the Bahamas. Why not? The mountain, one of the most renowned landmarks in the Cumbrian national park, would still be protected from development even if it is sold . A favourite among tourists and walkers, is only the second mountain to be put on the market, after Snowdon in 1998 . Estate agent John Robson said he hoped someone would buy it, in the same way someone might buy a 'stunning piece of artwork' 'We can still walk on it, and fly over it, and do what the hell we like with it. It's not going anywhere.' Lord Lonsdale inherited the peak, which covers an area of 2,676 acres, from his father in 2006. The iconic mountain is commonly known as Saddleback, due . to the distinctive drop from its peak. On a clear day, it gives view over to the Isle of Man and North Wales. But Lord Lonsdale is still embarking on new ground. Blencathra is only the second mountain to be put on the market, since Snowdon went up for sale in 1998. The peak, which has six separate fell tops, has been in the Lowther family for 400 years . Covering nearly 2,700 acres, the mountain gives stunning views, sometimes as far-reaching as the Isle of Man and North Wales . It will not have a For Sale sign to alert . potential buyers, but the mountain will be advertised in a glossy . brochure, before being bought under sealed bids. Lord Lonsdale, who has several lordships under his belt, is also selling the lordship of the manor of Threlkeld - a ceremonial title, dating back to the 18th Century - to go with the mountain. John Robson, managing director of Lonsdale Settlement Estates, said: 'It is one of the biggest tourist destinations in this country. He said: 'We hope someone will buy it in . the way they would buy a stunning piece of art work. But instead of a . picture of the landscape you are getting the real thing. Lord Lonsdale said he will still 'walk on it, fly over it and do what the hell we like with it' when he sells the iconic peak . Lord Lonsdale says he plans to buy a super yacht in the south of France or a house in the Bahamas once he sells Blencathra . 'The mountain features in the Wainwright mountain guides. It is a unique opportunity to own something so unusual. 'It is the stand out mountain in the Lake District, with a truly beautiful landscape.' The Lowther family have a long history and Lord Lonsdale's father, who was the seventh generation to own the land, inherted the estate in 1953, aged 39. Blencathra's reputation as a tourist attraction has its roots in the 18th century, when people would travel by horseback or carriage along the new Penrith to Keswick turnpike road to enjoy the spectacular views. It was also a favourite of the fell-walker and guide book author Alfred Wainwright.","The iconic Lake District peak, Blencathra, is on the market for £1.75m .

"A bighorn sheep escaped from the Los Angeles Zoo on Saturday and died after being struck by a driver who fled the scene, authorities said. The adult female sheep escaped an exhibit just before noon and traversed the Santa Monica Mountains from the area in Griffith Park where the zoo is located, zoo spokeswoman April Spurlock said. Witnesses reported seeing the ewe being hit by a car near the Greek Theatre in the Los Feliz section of the city, near the entrance to the park, police said. Baaad escape: A bighorn sheep (not pictured) escaped from the Los Angeles Zoo on Saturday and died after being struck by a driver who fled the scene . Zookeepers, park rangers and a police helicopter joined the search after the animal was reported missing. When zoo personnel and veterinarians got to the sheep, they tranquilized the animal to bring it back to its habitat but it died at the scene, Spurlock said. 'It's suspected that it died after being hit, but we won't know the cause of death until a necropsy is performed,' she said. She said an investigation was underway to determine how the sheep escaped. 'We looked at the habitat, and we're not sure how it got out,' Spurlock said. The ewe was one of five bighorn sheep in the zoo exhibit. The desert bighorn sheep has been listed as endangered since 1998 due to loss of habitat, disease brought by domestic sheep and cattle and predation.

"They are one of nature's most magnificent predators, and these stunning pictures show how they can jump up to eight feet in the air. The 15-foot-long great white shark completes the jump in a quest for food.

"Thanksgiving could be marred by floods as snow-hit areas across the east coast look set for a sharp rise in temperatures, the National Weather Service has warned. The big freeze saw areas such as Buffalo, New York, buried in historic blizzards, reaching a year's snowfall - 88 inches - in just five days. Armies of shovelers have descended on the city in a desperate bid to make a dent in the unprecedented road blocks. But forecasters claim it could all melt in less than 24 hours if temperatures soar from 40F to 70F as predicted. Scroll down for video . Flood warning: The National Weather service said a year's snowfall in Buffalo, NY, could melt by Thursday . Warming up: This map shows how the east coast is set to experience warmer climes in the coming week . More than 200 volunteers, called the Shovel Brigade Mob, armed themselves with shovels and headed into neighborhoods south of downtown Buffalo. The group said some residents were still stuck in their homes, days after a lake-effect system clobbered the region with up to seven feet of snow. The heat wave is expected as an intense cyclone sweeps north east from the Midwest, driving warmer climes into West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. It could spell a moment of relief for Minneapolis after an historic stretch of freezing temperatures that has lasted 12 days - the longest since 1880. Emergency services are still shoveling snow to clear the area and rescue civilians. At least 13 have been killed by the extreme weather. The NWS predicted temperatures would start to climb above freezing by early Sunday, reaching 60F by Monday. Hard-hit: The city was one of a few across the east coast that have seen historic levels of snow this week . Tragic: At least 13 have been pronounced dead following weather related incidents, officials claim . Temperatures in western New York will stay above freezing until at least Tuesday night, with highs of nearly 50F on Sunday and nearly 60F on Monday, the Weather Service said. 'The warming will bring melting. The melting will bring water. Water will bring floods,' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. 'We are preparing now for more flooding than we have seen in a long, long time,' he said. 'We've never had this much snow and this much melting of this much snow in a short period of time.' Some areas should expect five to six feet of water, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said. To prepare, area residents said they were moving valuables out of their basements. Warning: Residents in Buffalo, as well as Chicago and DC, are clearing their homes for fear of floods . Rocketing: Temperatures look set to hit 70F, a climb of 30 degress from 40F which Buffalo is now . Sections of the New York State Thruway will reopen on Friday afternoon to move vehicles and help remove snow, Cuomo said. Some 140 miles of the thruway had been closed. Experts warn the exact figures are still vague and they are taking samples of the snow to gauge how likely the flood risk is. Initial research found rising dew points and winds pointing south will 'make for a more efficient melting of the snowpack'.","National Weather Service says snow could melt in 24 hours .

"A Georgia man accused of leaving his toddler son to die inside a hot car will not face the death penalty, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds said in an emailed statement that he won't seek the death penalty against Justin Ross Harris after reviewing the state's death penalty statute and other factors. He declined to elaborate. Police have said the 22-month-old Cooper Harris was left in the vehicle for about seven hours on a day when temperatures in the Atlanta area reached at least into the high 80s. The medical examiner's office has said the boy died of hyperthermia — essentially overheating — and called his death a homicide. Not facing death: Prosecutors will not seek the death penalty against Ross Harris after his 22-month old son died when he was left in a hot car for seven hours . Harris' attorney Maddox Kilgore did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Harris faces multiple charges, including malice murder, felony murder and cruelty to children. The malice murder charge indicates prosecutors intend to prove Harris intentionally left his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in the hot car. The eight-count indictment also includes charges related to sexually explicit exchanges prosecutors say Harris had with an underage girl. Serious allegations: Ross Harris is facing murder charges for leaving little Cooper in a hot parked car for seven hours, while he sexted multiple women at work . During a three-hour bond and probable cause hearing in July, Cobb County Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring questioned a police detective at length, outlining evidence he said proved that Harris intentionally left his young boy in the hot SUV. Harris was sitting in his office exchanging nude photos with several women, including a teenager, the day his son died, Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at the hearing. The indictment also accuses Harris of asking a girl under the age of 18 to send him a nude photo and of sending nude photos of himself and sexually explicit messages to her. It charges him with attempting to sexually exploit a child and with disseminating harmful material to a minor. Harris' attorney has said the state has introduced several inconsistent theories about a potential motive in the boy's death, which he has said was a terrible accident. Harris is a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and moved to Georgia in 2012 to work for Home Depot.","Cooper Harris died after his father Ross left him in the family car in 80 degree temperatures for seven hours .

"Olympic hurdler-turned-bobsledder Lolo Jones has revealed she eats four McDonald's double bacon cheeseburgers every day as well as calorie-laden protein shakes, chocolate bars and ice-cream, all in the name of her sport. The 31-year-old weighs more than ever before - 157 pounds - thanks to a 9,000-calorie-a-day diet that is helping her pile on the weight. The star weighed just 130 pounds when she competed in the 100 meter hurdles at the London Olympics, and the mantra on the track is 'fat doesn't fly.' But she is now training hard to qualify for the Sochi Games for bobsledding, and in that sport the popular thinking is 'mass pushes mass,' she said. Piling on the pounds: Bobsledder Lolo Jones, pictured on September 30, has gained some 30 pounds since competing at the London Olympics . Happy: Jones said she was pumped about the weight gain because it is all muscle . 'I'm the heaviest ever in my life,' Jones told USA TODAY Sports. She said her very un-Olympic daily diet includes two protein shakes - which, at 1,365 each, are more than the total recommended daily intake for some people - plus not one but four McDonald's double bacon cheeseburgers. She admitted the change in diet was stark. In track, 'you eat an M&M and you think your career is over,' Jones said. But the ultra fit woman isn't stopping her junk food binge just yet. Burgers: Jones is eating 9,000 calories a day for the Olympics, which includes four stops at McDonald's . 'It took so much work. I'm three . pounds away from my ultimate goal,' she said. The extra muscle mass, . which saw her literally burst the seams of her speed suit at a recent . commercial photo shoot, will help her power a 400-pound bobsled. 'I'm pumped about this muscle weight,' Jones told USA TODAY. 'My abs are still there. I'm still cut, just super solid.' In a February interview, after Olympic bobsledder Elana Meyers suggested Jones give the sport a try to pick herself up from the disappointment of coming fourth in the hurdle finals in London, the athlete revealed she was scoffing ice cream, pizza and chocolate to put on weight. 'In the track world, I would eat two carrots and be worried about risking a 12-second race,' Jones said. 'Now they're buying me these huge mocha bars.' London: The Olympian, pictured in London last August, weighed just 133 pounds when she finished fourth . Slim: Lolo Jones, right at the Olympic athletics trials in Eugene, Oregon in June 2012, was used to restricting what she ate . Video source YouTube . She's serious about the sport, and if her bobsled debut year proved anything she's likely to help Team U.S. score a medal when the Olympics roll around. Jones and driver Jazmine Fenlator paired to win a silver medal at the World Cup season-opener in Lake Placid, New York. Team trials for the Sochi Games begin October 12 in Lake Placid and the Olympics kick off in 130 days. Then the diet begins.

"Members of the public could go on patrol with frontline police officers, a senior Metropolitan Police officer has said. Assistant Commissioner Helen King said she wanted British police forces to adopt the American 'ride-along' scheme, which sees people join officers on the beat. Ms King believes confidence in the police could be improved by showing members of the public what officers do and how they make decisions. Members of the public could go on US-style ride-alongs with frontline police officers, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Helen King said . According to the London Evening Standard, Ms King said: 'Quite a few forces in the States have a 'ride-along' programme and I have always found that a powerful idea. 'It is quite easy to look at what the police do and pick holes in it but actually once you are alongside them on patrol and realise what they face, how they don't know what's coming next and how quickly they have to make decisions, it helps people understand the pressures they face.' The scheme was trialled in Lewisham, south-east London, earlier this week in an unmarked car earlier this week with the Metropolitan Police hoping to offer ride-alongs each month to community members interested in policing. Avon and Somerset and Thames Valley police forces already run similar schemes, but London officers are said to have concerns over the safety of taking members of the public along with them. If the scheme is rolled out, people might not be able to go on patrol in their neighbourhood in case officers have to deal with anyone they know. There are hopes that the ride-alongs may help increase confidence in policing. Ms King said the ride-alongs would improve public confidence in the police as members of the public would see how officers make decisions (file picture) The 'Plebgate' affair, concerns about undercover officers and the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster have all lowered public confidence in the police, with the number of people feeling the Metropolitan Police in particular are doing a good job 'flat-lining' at 68 per cent, Ms King said. She added: 'There are individuals in communities who often for legitimate reasons have suspicions about what we do and why we do it. We need to work really hard to break that down and help them understand some of the issues we are dealing with. 'We want many more people knowing and believing that the police are there for them and that they are on their side.' Last month a report recommended that students, teachers and judges are brought on patrol with inner-city officers.","Members of the public could join patrols with frontline police officers .

Party girl: Erika Menendez, 31, during happier times. She allegedly pushed an Indian immigrant into the path of an oncoming subway train Thursday . A New York fire chief revealed today that he was attacked by Erika Menendez, the deranged woman who pushed a man to his death on the Subway on Thursday, . Daniel Conlisk, a retired Battalion Chief who battled to save lives in the Twin Towers, said he too had been attacked by Menendez, who is claiming she killed Sen because of her hatred of muslims post 9/11. The officer told the New York Daily News of his sadness following the death of Sen and how he took out two orders of protection against Menendez following the incident almost a decade ago. 'That poor guy she pushed . . . I consider myself so lucky now,' Conlisk, 65, told the paper. 'The thought of it gives me chills. The whole situation is sad. It’s horrible.' Conlisk was taking out the trash at his home in Ridgewood, Queens, when he says Menendez attacked him from nowhere. 'I was going out with the recyclables. It was dark out. Then this girl . was standing there in front of me. She was shouting, ‘You f---ed my . mother!’ ' Conlisk told the newspaper. 'She started charging at me. She started clawing me in the face. I was trying to get away from her.' 'There was blood on my face, my chest and my neck,' he added. The officer says Menendez's boyfriend at the time asked him not to press charges.

Crime scene: Sen was struck by the train and killed at the 40th Street station near Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside, pictured . Authorities arrested Menendez after her family tipped them off on Friday, sources told The New York Post. Officers reportedly spotted Menendez in Brooklyn's Crown Heights . area at about 5 a.m. Saturday. At the time, she wore the same jacket as she did in . surveillance video retrieved from the 40th Street-Lowery subway station . in Queens. Police reportedly tried in vain to question a muttering Menendez, who at one point inquired after the R train's location. 'All I know is that she's bipolar and as far as seeing the footage, I'm pretty sure it was her,' a cousin of the suspect told the Post. The doorman at the  Rego Park building where Menendez’s mother and stepfather  live said she visited her folks regularly. On the run: Menendez was captured on a surveillance camera fleeing from the train station after the incident .

The New York Daily News reported Sen had lived in the U.S. for the past 20 years and currently resided in a Queens apartment with at least two roommates. It was not clear if he was Muslim or Hindi. Hunt: New York Police Department chief spokesman Paul Browne said the woman fled the scene, pictured, after the shocking attack and officers were searching for her . Investigation: Officers, pictured, quizzed witnesses after the shocking incident .

Meanwhile, Kelly has said Sen was looking . westbound as the train pulled into the station and likely didn't . see the woman leaping from a bench and shoving him at the last, possible moment before the train arrived. Sen was struck by the first car of an 11-car northbound train and got stuck under the wheels of the second car, Browne said. The NYPD chief added Sen, who was . pronounced dead at the scene, had 'terrible injuries that make providing . a description difficult at this time.' It also has not been determined if anyone tried . to help the man up before he was struck by the train. However, according to witnesses, there wouldn't have been time. 'I . heard the train screech as it was stopping and then heard this loud . scream,' Linda Santini-Tripodis, who was beneath the 40th Street station . at the time, told the newspaper. 'I'm never going to forget that scream for as long as I live.' Sen's death marks a second time this month that someone has been killed in such a gruesome fashion. However, Browne added there was 'no trend' of . such horrific occurrences. 'It's the urban nightmare,' Browne told Bloomberg. 'It's sometimes in the back of peoples' minds because of the incident preceding this one, but there's no indication that it is related in any way or inspired it,' he added. Crime scene: The shocking incident occurred at around 8pm at the station, pictured, and is the second horrific case this month . Shocking: Sen was standing on the elevated platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when he was shoved on the tracks . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly said during his weekly radio address Friday he understood that the extraordinary nature of the tragedy did not diminish its impact upon the victims' families. 'To say it’s only two in a long period of time doesn’t help either person,' he said. 'I don’t know what happened here.' Police viewed footage from a 24-hour surveillance camera outside a pizzeria located across from the station and were able to obtain clear images of the suspect, according to The New York Times. 'She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,' Oasis Restaurant owner, Giovanni Briones, told the newspaper, describing the video he provided detectives. On December 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was shoved in front of a train in Times Square. A photograph of him on the tracks a . split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New . York Post the next day, causing an uproar and debate over whether the . photographer, who had been waiting for a train, should have tried to . help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image. Charged: Homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, pictured, was charged with murder after pushing a man under a train on December 3 . Dead: Ki-Suck Han, pictured, was shoved in front of a train in Times Square . A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and is being held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming Han was the aggressor and had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before. Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many of the commuters who ride the city's subway a total of more than 5.2 million times on an average weekday, but deaths are rare. Among the more high-profile cases was the January 1999 death of aspiring screenwriter Kendra Webdale, who was shoved by a former mental patient. After that, the state Legislature passed Kendra's Law, which lets mental health authorities supervise patients who live outside institutions to make sure they are taking their medications and aren't threats to safety. On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said that had some concerns about the state releasing mentally ill people from custody.

The app, which is used by over 10 million dating fanatics, matches users who are in close proximity to each other and allows people to decide whether they find each other attractive based on a select number of Facebook photos. This means that Schoolies who are in a crowd on the Gold Coast could take out there phone and potentially swipe through all the Tinder users in the room. Social media experts believe Schoolies looking to meet a match on the Gold Coast this weekend are likely to turn to the dating app Tinder . Schoolies week kicked off tonight in Surfers Paradise, with over 20,000 teenagers expected to hit up the popular designated party zone on the beach by 7pm tonight. Experts say the apps eliminates any social awkwardness that may be involved in directly talking to either a boy or a girl. Professionals say Tinder can be used as a conversation starter amongst teens and there should not be a social stigma attached to the online dating tool. The popular matchmaking mobile phone application can be used by people under the age of 18, however underage users are unable to access the Tinder profiles of people who are over 18. Schoolies who are in a crowd on the Gold Coast could take out there phone and potentially swipe through all the Tinder users in the room . Tinder offers users the opportunity to interact with people nearby, who have common interests. Users then 'swipe left' if they do not think they are a match, or 'swipe right' if they think they are perfect for each other. Speaking to the Age, Associate Professor Burgess said Tinder's popularity has grown significantly in the last year due to the success of other dating apps. The popular matchmaking mobile phone application can be used by people under the age of 18, however they are unable to access any other Tinder profiles where the users are over 18 . 'We've seen a massive mainstreaming of mobile dating as opposed to online dating, and Tinder has been a huge part of that,' she said. Tinder follows in the footsteps of previous dating sites including PlentyOfFish, Match.com and OKcupid.com . 'We talk about 'digital delegation' – Tinder outsources checking age, sourcing pictures and building a profile to Facebook,' Professor Burgess said. Concerned parents have warned their kids against the dating app, which has come under fire in recent months due to its controversial nature and it's ability to let complete strangers view users' personal photos . 'But you've got to be careful of toolies on Tinder just as you would out in a club.'

It’s in complete contradiction to our own ethical policy.’ Ms Phipps said that clothing retailer Whistles, which sold the £45 T-shirts – worn by Labour’s Harriet Harman and Ed Miliband, and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg – was conducting the investigation with Made-By, a charity dedicated to ethical standards in fashion. ‘Whistles are concerned and the government of Mauritius is concerned. What matters to us now is that there is a full and thorough investigation. Whistles are in Mauritius. We expect to have a report from them in about two weeks.’ But the news came after the charity was again accused of ‘shameless hypocrisy’ over its new campaign for a ‘living wage’ in the UK, despite the fact the migrant workers in Mauritius are paid far below the official ‘living wage’ there, and were living 16 to a room in dormitories. Yet When The Mail on Sunday asked the Society whether it supported the living wage in Mauritius – which would represent a significant pay rise for workers producing their T-shirts at the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile (CMT) factory – we received no comment. The official Mauritian living wage is £1.47 an hour, though the workers making the T-shirts do receive free board and lodging, however basic. Labour leader Ed Miliband in the T-shirt, left, and right, how The Mail on Sunday reported workers' plight . Whistles and the Fawcett Society chose to ignore the living wage – an official Mauritius government benchmark of a basic salary in the country – and instead pointed out the women were being paid above the minimum wage, a figure even the government accepted needs to be reviewed. In a press release last week, the Fawcett Society gave its full backing to the concept of a living wage, at least in the UK. Commenting on figures showing the disparity between wages paid to men and women had closed only a little in the past year, it said more needed to be done to reduce the gender pay gap, and called on the Government to sign up to the living wage in this country by paying it to civil servants and encouraging local authorities to do the same. Fawcett’s deputy chief executive Dr Eva Neitzert said: ‘We urgently need to tackle the unacceptably low wages paid to women. ‘Government should take the lead in supporting the take-up of the living wage.’ Jane Ragoo, a Mauritius union leader, last night condemned the Society over its UK living wage comments, saying: ‘It seems to think it is OK to exploit workers in Mauritius, but not in the UK. It is guilty of shameful hypocrisy.’","Fawcett Society has finally conceded it is 'very concerned' about working conditions in Mauritian factory .

"An estate agents has been forced to change its name from ISIS Residential Homes to distance itself from the terrorist group in Syria. The company, created 10 years ago, was named after the Egyptian goddess of family, by its founders. However after the emergence of the barbaric extremist group in the Middle East, bosses have decided to rename the business. iSis Residential has been forced to change its name to distance itself from the terrorist organisation in Syria . It comes after a Belgian chocolate company of the same name was forced to rebrand and campaigners suggested a dog in Downton Abbey be renamed to avoid confusion. Steven Harvey, Managing director of the estate agents in Staines, Surrey, said: 'We, like most, have watched the actions of Islamic State in the Middle East unfold with shock and revulsion. 'As a company which regrettably shares a historic term of reference with this group, the public connection, however tenuous, has caused us much anguish. Managing Director Steven Harvey said the company was revolted by the extremist group . 'Fortunately, as a long established local brand our business has not suffered any noticeable impact.' The business will now be known as Oasis Residential Homes, and is moving to a larger premises next year. In April last year when the terrorist organisation first became known, the estate agents decided against changing its name. But as time went on and further atrocities were committed by the group, bosses felt compelled to take action. 'It is because of our success and support locally that we felt confident enough to weather the media storm, especially as ISIS as a definition has been superseded by IS and ISIL in April 2013,"" said Mr Harvey. 'As the actions of ISIS become ever more desperate, ignoring the association in the hope that the media moves on is no longer an option, regardless of our personal sentiments. 'While we had no intention of changing our name, a natural stage in our business life cycle affords us the opportunity to adjust our name as part of our planned expansion. Twitter users suggested Isis the dog in Downton Abbey should be killed off to avoid association with terrorists. He appeared sickly in a recent episode of the ITV show (pictured) 'While the journey in reaching this decision has been a distracting one, now we are here we know it is the right decision and it enables us to concentrate on what we do best - selling and letting homes.' It comes after a Belgian chocolate company was forced to change its name following confusion with the branch of terrorists. Italo Suisse renamed itself Isis after a new line of pralines and tablets. The company was forced to change its name to Libeert following public upset. The Grantham family's pet Labrador in Downton Abbey also came under fire, with Twitter users suggesting the animal be killed off to avoid any association with extremists. An Australian couple were also urged to consider finding a renaming their eight-year-old daughter earlier this year in light of the group's activity.

"The son of a woman whose body parts were found shoved into bags and scattered around a Bronx neighborhood this morning has confessed to the crime, after an electric saw and other carving implements were discovered in the apartment they shared. Police were overwhelmed by the stench of bleach when they entered the apartment 22-year-old Bashid McLean shared with his mother Tanya Byrd, 45, whom he is suspected of killing. He was led out of the house in handcuffs after police recovered a saw, gloves and a Sawzall power saw, which they believe he used in the disturbing crime. Shocking: The body parts of Tanya Byrd, pictured, were found strewn around at least four different curbside locations in the Bronx . Byrd's body parts were found strewn around at least four different curbside locations within a half-mile of the pair's Morrisania home in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The pieces - which include her head, torso, right leg and hands - were found zipped into travel bags or stuffed into plastic garbage bags. McLean, who suffers learning . disabilities, admitted to the crime during questioning by NYPD officers, sources told The New York Daily News. Investigators . have spent the day scouring through piles of trash in the South Bronx . neighborhood after a horrified dog-walker discovered human remains in a travel bag at around 4:30am and . called police. One-by-one, . Byrd's decapitated head, right leg, torso and hands have been unearthed . in the area around . Eagle Avenue, 158th Street, 156th Street and Cauldwell Avenue. Some of . Byrd's body parts were still wearing the clothes she was in when she was . slaughtered, police sources told the Daily News.

A neighbor told the paper: 'I . wouldn’t be at all surprised if Bashid killed her. She was afraid of . that boy... He was a hellion.' Byrd was sometimes frightened of her son . but loved him, a relative who didn't want to be named told DNAInfo. 'He's acted out in violent ways before, but I never thought he could do . something like this. Not in a million years.' But Byrd's sister, Cassandra McLean, insisted the boy was innocent. She believes her sister's allegedly abusive ex-boyfriend was responsible for her ghastly murder and dismemberment. Police confirmed Byrd's son reported her . missing at the Bronx's 40th precinct station. He found a photograph of her, which they matched to the decapitated head found in . one of the bags,  when police showed up at his house. This is when they discovered the saw. He reportedly told police he hadn't been able to contact his mother for at least a day. Right leg: Byrd's right leg, pictured under a sheet, was discovered in a pile of trash on the corner of E156 Street and Eagle Avenue .

Detectives: The mother's body was chopped up and scattered around the Bronx neighborhood. Police say far fewer murders were carried out this year in New York . Cassandra McLean said her nephew suffered learning difficulties from an early age. She said Bashid McLean told her Byrd's former boyfriend dropped by on Monday and that was the last time he saw her. 'He (the ex-boyfriend) came over . yesterday and walked out with her in the morning, yesterday morning,' McLean told the newspaper. 'That’s what her son told me on the phone . just now.' She told DNAInfo that Byrd's ex-boyfriend was trouble. 'I told my sister to stay away from him, but she said he's harmless and not to worry.' McLean added of her sister,  who also had a 23-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son with Down's syndrome: 'She was a loving mother and very devoted to her son. That's what she lived for. That's her joy in life.' Neighbor . Elizabeth Cruz told the newspaper the woman would never have left her . youngest son willingly, as his Down's syndrome means he is very reliant . on her.

Another neighbor who knew the woman told DNAInfo that Byrd was a good to her kids. 'She's a good person, she's a good mom,' they said. The Daily News reported a witness saying they saw a suspect dump the bags and their gruesome contents on the curb for collection and then flee the scene in a silver SUV. One woman said a female leg was clearly visible, protruding from one of the bags. 'It was sticking out the bag and . apparently it was an African-American leg,' she told WCBS 880. 'It was . on top of the garbage that we put out.' Byrd's . right leg was found on Eagle Avenue near 156th Street, while her torso . was discovered on Eagle Ave near 158th Street, witnesses told The Post. Smiles: Byrd, pictured, met a grisly death and her son, Bahsid McLean, 22, is the only suspect at this point in the investigation .

The mother's head was found at Cauldwell Avenue and 158th. Investigators have also found the woman's hand, though it's unclear where. 'I saw the police find it. It was on top of the garbage, the recyclables,' a 53-year-old witness told The Post of the leg discovery. She said it was in a plastic trash bag that was stuffed inside a small traveler's bag. 'That family is going to suffer, somebody is going to wake up without their mother,' she added early this morning. Investigators are continuing to look . through other garbage piled up on the street along with discarded . furniture and have roped off the area. Building superintendents were told to steer clear of the trash piles. Grisly: Police detectives, left, investigate a site on Cauldwell Avenue where the woman's head was discovered .

Suspect: A witness said they saw a suspect dump the bags and their gruesome contents and then flee the scene, pictured, in a silver SUV . 'You could tell it was real. You could see past the ankle, but there was no blood,' Bobby, a superintendent for a building overlooking where one of the body parts was found, told DNAInfo. 'It's creepy. It feels like some Freddy Kruger stuff. I don't like it at all, man.' Byrd was taken to the medical examiner to determine the cause of death. The bags were found strewn near El Batey Borincano Garden, part of a quiet residential block that comprises two religious schools and a church. 'I really don't know what to think,' nearby resident Joyce Placencia told CBS News. 'This is the first time I've seen something like this happening around here.' Dozens of uniformed police officers swarmed the area after the disturbing discoveries and continued searching for evidence into the afternoon. A police spokesman said they'll remain at the scene as long as required.","Body parts of an African-American woman were found in at least four travel and plastic bags strewn among garbage in South Bronx .

"Mass production: Orange juice has changed over the years . There was a time when  it was marketed as the ultimate health drink, a glass of sunshine packed with vitamins and energy. Generations were raised to believe orange juice fights off colds, boosts the immune system, tones the skin and protects against cancer. Yet in the topsy-turvy world of health advice, what’s good for you one day, turns out to be bad for you the next. This week an influential body of Government scientists blamed Britain’s love affair with orange juice and other sugary drinks for fuelling a crisis of obesity and ill health. The warning follows calls to remove fruit juice as one of the recommended ‘five a day’ portions of fruit or vegetables, and for parents to ban it from the meal table. So if fruit juice turns out to be such a devil in disguise, why have we all been led to believe it was so healthy for so long? The idea goes back to the 1920s, when American nutritionist Elmer McCollum blamed a condition called acidosis, an excess of acid in the blood, on diets rich in bread and meat.  His bizarre solution was lots of lettuce and — paradoxically — acidic citrus fruits. At the time orange juice was not hugely popular, but fruit growers leapt on the acidosis panic and sales rose. Juice got an even bigger boost thanks to World War II when the U.S. Government wanted a new way to get a product rich in  vitamin C to troops overseas. It poured money into research. In 1947 — just in time for the post-war consumer boom — scientists invented a way to remove water from juice and freeze the concentrate into a palatable product. The blocks of this concentrate could be sold to the new fridge-owning U.S. consumers or stored by manufacturers for months at a time, and sales exploded. Meanwhile in the UK, war babies had been given rose hip, blackcurrant and concentrated orange juice by the Government as a cheap nutrition supplement in the 1940s. This continued into the 1950s, seeding the idea in a generation of baby boomers that juice is healthy. By the 1980s orange juice was being marketed not just as a health drink, but also as the key to a stylish, modern life  — a status it enjoys today. But while the juice in the supermarket is often sold as ‘natural’ or ‘fresh’, it is usually anything but. Concentrating . juice doesn’t just remove water, it also removes the flavour. After it . has been reconstituted, manufacturers add ‘flavour packs’ — cocktails of . chemicals which restore ‘natural’ oranginess. You may think ‘not from concentrate’ juice means a more authentic product. You’d be wrong. Juice . made that way is heated and stored in air-free tanks for up to a year. Again, the process strips the juice of flavour, which has to be added . afterwards. But the flavour packs contain orange essence and orange oil . so don’t have to appear separately on the ingredients list. Breakfast! But while juice contains many vitamins and minerals, there is no fibre - and a lot of sugar . Manufacturers say they help give their . product a consistent flavour. They also explain why juice in cartons . doesn’t taste like fresh juice. ‘Naturalness’ isn’t the only dubious claim made for juice. For decades, health gurus, . and some doctors, have claimed the vitamin C in juice fights common . colds. But while the immune system needs vitamin C, there’s little evidence that regularly taking the stuff prevents colds. Research . shows that the best that can be claimed for vitamin C is that it might . shorten colds by a day or two. Given that most of us get two colds a . year, worrying about vitamin C every day seems an over-reaction. There’s . another myth about vitamin C, that citrus fruits are the best source. Yet plenty of vegetables, including broccoli, potatoes, kale and . peppers, have doses comparable to those in fruit. What you will get from juice is sugar. Lots and lots of it. The new advice this week from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition is that men should have a maximum of 35g of sugar a day — seven to eight teaspoons — while women should not exceed 25g — five to six teaspoons. A single 330ml glass of orange juice has eight teaspoons. Helen Bond, spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association, says: ‘People have lost sight of how much sugar is in food and portion sizes have got bigger. A 150ml glass provides one of your five a day and anything more than that doesn’t count. But measure people’s glasses and they are often 250ml. ‘Juice provides a lot of vitamins and minerals, but unlike fresh fruit you don’t get the healthy fibre.’ Doctors say the huge volume of sugar in our diet is contributing to the obesity epidemic, causing heart disease, cancer and diabetes. There is growing concern that not all sugars are the same — and that fructose, the type found in fruit, may be more harmful than table sugar. American hormone scientist Robert Lustig argues that it does more damage to the liver and cells than glucose or sucrose. He says excessive fructose intake is key to rising obesity and diabetes levels. There is even evidence that fructose may contribute to higher uric acid levels in the blood — and increase the risk of gout, an excruciatingly painful condition that is becoming ever more common. Orange juice can also rot your teeth. Around half of five-year-olds have signs of damage to their tooth enamel, and too much fruit juice is thought to be a key cause. There have been signs this year, however, that the tide is turning. Schools have been leading the way. In January, Elizabeth Chaplin, the head of Valence Primary School in Dagenham, London, told parents that pupils would not be allowed juice in their lunch boxes. Instead, they had to drink water. Around that time, Professor Susan Jebb, the Government’s obesity tsar, said juice shouldn’t count towards your five a day. ‘Fruit juice is absorbed very fast,’ she said, ‘so by the time it gets to your stomach, your body doesn’t know whether it’s Coca-Cola or orange juice, frankly. I have to say it is a relatively easy thing to give up. If you are going to drink it, you should dilute it.’ Weaning Britain off fruit juice may be difficult. Market research firm Mintel says 83 per cent of us drink fruit juice or a smoothie at least once a week, while 76 per cent believe fruit juice to be healthy. But if you need motivation when you sit down to breakfast, remember this: there is more sugar in a 250ml glass of fruit juice than in a large bowl of Frosties with milk. And that’s food for thought.","Juice was popularised after Second World War as cheap health supplement .

"The Islamic State militant group claims teenage terrorist Numan Haider's stabbing of two police officers was a call to action by the group's leader.

"A Joey Essex wannabe dubbed Britain's vainest man has been forced to flee his home after receiving death threats over his £55,000 bid to look like the TOWIE star. Sam Barton, 22, transformed his face with several cosmetic operations - including a nose job funded by the taxpayer - in a desperate attempt to look like Joey Essex. Last week he announced he planned to sue the NHS over the 'botched' operation so he could spend the money on a BMW.

Sick: A tweet sent to Mr Barton suggested he hang himself after he asked what he should do one evening . On Sunday night, Mr Barton asked his 22,000 Twitter followers for ideas on what he should do that evening. One user, using the name Mr Nobody, replied: 'hang yourself'. Mr Barton retweeted the post, leading followers to criticise the person who sent the message. Chris Brackley wrote: 'That is way to [sic] strong is there any need for that at all.' Mr Barton also tweeted that a man had threatened to break the Joey Essex wannabe's nose. Other sick trolls posted death threats to the 22-year-old on Facebook, forcing him to flee his parents' home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, to a friend's house for his family's safety.

Mr Barton (left) received a £5,000 nose job on the NHS as part of his quest to look like Joey Essex (right) Recovering: The 22-year-old barman posted a picture of himself online after the taxpayer-funded nose job . Barton, a barman who lives with his parents and brother, said: 'I am leaving my family home as I don't want to put my family at risk. 'I am prepared to receive a lot of abuse as what I say is controversial, but I think a line is drawn when someone says they will kill you. 'I am looking to move into a flat. My parents don't really want me to leave but they understand my decision. I just don't want to put them at risk. 'It really has unnerved me. You don't know what some people are capable of. 'I have reported it to the police and they have told me they will investigate. I am meeting them again and will take it from there.' In August, Mr Barton was left with a bruised lip after he was punched in the face in a nightclub in Romford, Essex. During the altercation, the suspect allegedly shouted: 'You will need a new nose job before I have finished with you' in reference to Mr Barton's £5,000 taxpayer-funded nose job.

He payed £5,400 for another nose straightening operation which was not done by the NHS. Mr Barton said he had been driven to sue the health service because of negative comments people have made since he hit the headlines after his 'uneven' nose job.

They are also choosing taller trees to make their homes look extra special this festive season, according to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA). Traditionally, 6ft trees have been popular, but demand is growing for 7ft and 8ft trees. Christmas tree grower Vincent Thurkettle says there is a good crop this year because of the mild weather and prices are about the same as last year, with 6ft Nordmann Firs at about £44 and 6ft Norway Spruces at £28. Despite the increased demand as the economy improves, prices are similar to last year. File photo . Harry Brightwell, secretary of the BCTGA, said: ‘Lots of people now like to have two trees, one in the lounge and another in the dining room or hall, because it adds to the festive atmosphere. ‘The tree is the centrepiece of Christmas for many and 6ft trees have always been popular, but now we are finding people are opting for that extra foot.’ Mr Thurkettle, 58, who grows Norway Spruce, Blue Spruce and Nordmann Firs at Manor Farm in Great Hockham, Norfolk, said: ‘People want trees which go from floor to ceiling. I think the economy is picking up and there is more money about. ‘We are also finding people are keen to buy narrow, space-saving trees. They want it to be a feature in the room but they don’t want it to dominate.’ Christmas tree grower Vincent Thurkettle says the crop is good this year because of mild weather.

"An Australian teenager has been arrested after he tweeted a bomb threat to American popstar Pink as she performed a concert. Shortly before the singer was due on stage for her Melbourne show, the unnamed 16-year-old posted: '@Pink I'm ready with my Bomb. Time to blow up #RodLaverArena. B****.' Security spotted the tweet because the teenager used the Rod Laver Arena hashtag and managed to identify him in the 12,000-strong crowd thanks to his profile photo on the social networking site. High alert: Pink was about to go on stage for her 'Truth About Love' tour in Melbourne when a fan in the audience sparked a security alert by tweeting that he was 'ready with my bomb' In trouble now: The tweet the 16-year-old boy posted while at Road Laver Arena in Melbourne shortly before Pink was due on stage to perform . He was escorted out of the venue and held by police for three hours until his parents could drive to the venue from their home in Warrnambool, 165 miles away, and take him home. The youngster, who had been at the concert with two friends, is now expected to be charged with uttering threats and causing a public nuisance when he appears in court later this week. His Twitter profile has also been deleted. The drama happened on Sunday night - the first of Pink's record-breaking run of 18 shows in Melbourne as part of her The Truth About Love world tour. The boy's father, named as David King, told a Melbourne radio station that security at the venue overreacted. Search: Security manged to spot the teenager in the 12,000-strong crowd at Rod Laver Arena from his profile picture on the social networking site . 'When he wrote that, he didn't have time to put ""Timebomb"",' he said. 'The policeman said to me, ""If it was up to me, I would have booted him in the backside and said go home"". But they demanded he be arrested.' The boy's sister has also defended his actions, telling Australian media he was a 'grade-A student' and that he sent the tweet after the concert was delayed by an hour. She said he also meant the message to refer to Pink's song, Timebomb, and not an actual bomb. She said: 'He wrote it as in one of her songs is called Timebomb and he forgot to put the Time on there. 'We are a decent family and we don't have bombs and stuff like that. We're not terrorists and we don't want people to think that. 'Boys will be boys. It wasn't an issue that they had a bomb, it wasn't a prank or anything like that. 'He told us he was referring to lyrics in a song and it was just a ""check-in"" sort of thing.' Charged: The teenager was escorted out of the concert and is expected to appear in court later this week over the incident . Describing what happened after he sent the tweet, she said security guards approached her brother inside the venue, showed him his Twitter profile pic and asked if it was him. 'Then seven people just jumped on him. It was just so violent,' she said. 'They pulled him, they threw him on the ground and locked him up. 'He's not a trouble maker. He's a grade-A student. 'We don't think it should be going to court because of the way they handled him.' A police spokesman said: 'We can confirm we were called to the Rod Laver Arena at about 8.30pm on Sunday in relation to a bomb threat. 'A 16-year-old boy from Warrnambool has been interviewed and is expected to be charged on summons.' A spokesman for the Rod Laver Arena said: 'We took swift and appropriate action in conjunction with Victoria Police to ensure the venue was secure and free from risk.'","Teenager sent tweet shortly before Pink was due on stage at Melbourne gig .

"They say it ain’t over till the fat lady sings, but calling an opera singer ‘dumpy’, ‘stocky’ and a ‘chubby bundle of puppy fat’ is a different matter — as male critics who commented on rising star Tara Erraught’s appearance are discovering. Fellow opera singers have accused them of sexism while music websites have been swamped with messages of support for 27-year-old Miss Erraught. The row erupted after the mezzo-soprano performed for the first time at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival in the comic opera Der Rosenkavalier. Scroll down for video . Storm: Tara Erraught, left in the male role of Octavian, received unflattering comments on her figure in reviews of her performance . Row: Rival opera experts have come out in defence of Ms Erraught, saying that the quality of a performers' voice is the only relevant quality . Dispute: Ms Erraught was palying a leading role in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier . The reviews provoked a furious . backlash because though her singing was widely praised, some included . disparaging remarks about her shape. Rupert . Christiansen of the Daily Telegraph said Miss Erraught is ‘dumpy of . stature and . . . her costuming makes her resemble something between . Heidi and Just William’. The Times described her as ‘unbelievable, unsightly and unappealing’. The . classical music website Slipped Disc hit back saying: ‘Tara Erraught . may carry slightly more heft than a size eight, but what has that to do . with performance? ‘Does excess body weight affect artistic performance on stage? Obviously not, as Luciano Pavarotti loudly demonstrated.’ Alice . Coote, a leading mezzo-soprano, said: ‘We cannot people our operatic . stages with singers that above all are believable visually or sexually . attractive to our critics — that way lies the death of opera . . . opera . is all about the voice.’ A . spokesman for Irish-born Miss Erraught said: ‘Tara is focused on the . music and  preparing for her upcoming performances. There will be no . further statement at this time.’ However, . her parents, who live near Dundalk and went to the opening night at . Glyndebourne on Saturday, voiced their distress at the row to the Mail. ‘Tara is concentrating on her work and not getting involved in the debate,’ said her mother Brianain, 50. ‘So, . we are not saying anything, even though there’s lots I would like to . say. She has a show tonight and just needs to concentrate on that. ‘Tara . has such inner strength. She takes the view that what’s said is said, . it’s out there now, and it would be much worse if they were criticising . her singing rather than her body. ‘She is getting tremendous support from everyone around her. She is a professional and is just getting on with it. ‘We’ve never had to face this before. She’s been reviewed in a lot of places and there’s never been an issue like this before.’ Miss . Erraught’s father Joe, 63, added: ‘I am so, so proud of my beautiful . daughter. You have to meet her to know you are living with an angel. All . of us — her family and people around here — are so proud of her. She is . a young woman of substance and I’m delighted to be able to say that . about my lovely girl. ‘I saw . her performance in Der Rosenkavalier and she was fantastic. She got a . standing ovation — what more could you ask for? She couldn’t have done . any better. ‘I wouldn’t like . to comment on the people who made the remarks about her. She’s a . sensible girl — it won’t affect her too much.’ Tara . began singing lessons at school when she was ten, but it was a family . holiday to Italy that set her on the path to becoming an internationally . acclaimed opera singer. ‘We . went to Verona and experienced a stunning production of [Verdi’s] Aida, . a life-changing experience and my first-ever live opera performance,’ she said in a recent interview. ‘I . already knew that I loved to sing, but this opera experience was a new . firework that interested me beyond belief. And that was it: I had . decided!’ After opera . singing lessons, she went on to study at the Royal Irish Academy of . Music in Dublin and then joined the Bavarian State Opera company. She . was catapulted to world-wide acclaim three years ago when she replaced . an ailing colleague in the role of Romeo with just five days’ notice to . learn the part. One German . reviewer said at the time: ‘They call it a breakthrough when a star is . born . . . Tara Erraught creates moments of wonder.’ She . has won several prestigious awards, toured the U.S. and made her London . recital debut at the Wigmore Hall in April. Fellow opera singers have . joined the protest at the Glyndebourne reviews and have spoken out in . support of the young singer. To watch video in full click here . 'Derisive': The criticism of Ms Erraught has been characterised as fat-shaming . Mezzo-soprano . Jennifer Johnson said: ‘How have we arrived at a point where opera is . no longer about singing but about the physique and looks of the singers? Clearly overt sexism is still rife.’ And . bass baritone Trevor Bowes has published a hard-hitting open letter to . Tara. ‘The hideous, immature, low-life trash that we saw hurled in the . name of music criticism could have landed on anyone,’ he said. ‘I am so deeply angry it happened to a radiant, beautiful performer bubbling with talent and technique. ‘You . have taken a bullet, but it will not be in vain. You have taken that . bullet for all of us, and it is our responsibility to make change in our . world. ‘We singers have all . been nagged or bullied about our bodies, though usually in private, and . it has done nothing but harm to us and to the artform. ‘It . is my hope that this has not only exposed certain critics as perverted . schoolboys with no imagination, but that it has also exposed everything . that has gone wrong in the opera world over the last generation or so. ‘I . believe this critic debacle and the backlash has been a catalyst to . usher in a new era where singing and artistry matter most, once again. It is  long overdue!’ Yesterday, . Daily Telegraph critic Mr Christiansen said he is ‘distressed to learn . that Miss Erraught has been upset by the hoo-ha’, but said he stands by . every word he wrote. He defended his review, saying he felt she had been cast ‘against type’ in a ‘principal boy’ role. He added that Miss Erraught is ‘a very pretty girl with a delightful smile and endearing stage presence’. Yes, it’s true that the Irish soprano Tara Erraught is never going to win Miss World, or even Miss Dundalk, any time soon. But then none of the shockingly ungallant critics who have described her as fat is a candidate for Mr Universe. Their complaint is that her role is unconvincing because she lacks the gamin, androgynous qualities of a principal boy. It is true that she suffers by comparison with her lover, sung by Kate . Royal, who is lissom and appears stark naked at the opening of the work. Even so, Miss Erraught sings fabulously, which is all that matters to some of the more old-fashioned of us. She . may not look remotely masculine, or have heart-throb qualities, but if . you can’t suspend disbelief, you shouldn’t go to the opera. What’s . more, I’ve seen much fatter singers — including one playing Wagner’s . great character Isolde, who was nearly the size of Yorkshire. Der Rosenkavalier is a comedy — not quite a Carry On, but not far off. As such, Miss Erraught should ignore her critics. A great future in opera awaits her, whatever they say. Ms Erraught, from Dundalk, Ireland, graduated from the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin and has been a member of the opera studio at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich since 2008. In summer 2010 she joined internationally celebrated French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet for the Prinsengracht-concert telecast from the canals of Amsterdam and made her debut at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. Ms Erraught won First Prize in the Jakub Pustina International Singing Competition in the Czech Republic along with the Zdar nad Sazavou Audience Prize in May 2008. In that same year she was awarded with both the Houston Grand Opera Prize and the Washington National Opera Prize at the International Hans Gabor Belvedere Singing Competition in Vienna. In March of 2010 she was awarded the National Concert Hall's Rising Star Award in Dublin. She has also won the Dermott Troy Award for the Best Irish Singer. Her professional debut came last year when, aged 26, she sand Il Barbiere di Siviglia at the Wiener . Staatsoper, and has performed in many acclaimed roles since.","Tara Erraught, 27, is playing a lead part at the Glydenbourne Opera Festival .

"Summer has kicked into full gear a little early across much of the nation with the south east of Australia copping the worst of a sweltering heatwave that has hit much of New South Wales. The temperature in Richmond, western Sydney recorded a record high of 45.2C, the hottest day since 1982 when the mercury reached 43.6C. Peter Zmijewski, senior meteorologist at Bureau of Meteorology, told Daily Mail Australia that the high temperatures were not unseasonal but because of the changing seasons. He said: 'This time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why we can experience very hot and cold in the same day. Scroll down for video . Bondi Beach was packed this afternoon as the temperatures hit high levels . This Instagram user posted this photo of her car thermometer where the temperatures topped 44C in Newcastle, NSW . 'This year seems to be on the hotter side than others, Richmond had its hottest day since 1982. It got so hot because we had a very low pressure troth moving the hot air from north western Australia down to NSW and the east coast. 'Tomorrow is going to be hot in the north eastern part of the state will still have pretty high temperatures. Normal temperatures for this time of year are 27C inland and about 23C in the coastal areas. 'The steam fog which we saw across Sydney today could have been caused by many factors but we don't know the exact cause of this phenomenon. It does not matter how hot or cold it is and they can happen at any time of day, why they appear is not simple.' After a day of relief following Friday's sizzler, Sydney is again sweating due to a mass of hot air that moved across state which has also caused more than 50 fires to burn out of control across the state. This morning some coastal residents also woke to a mysterious fog but weather experts have put it down to just condensed cloud close to the water which can be caused by a range of factors including humidity and temperature. The city's forecasted temperature was to reach the mid- to high 30s on Sunday, while Penrith and Richmond have already tipped the thermometer at their forecast of 43C at around 4pm. A strange mist covered Manly beach (pictured) which was put down to condensed cloud do to factors like temperature and humidity .

Meanwhile in the Hunter region, the small town of Cessnock reached a blistering 43.6 Sunday afternoon and Scone, 41.4, while in the upper west, Bourke no doubtedly melted its residents at a scorching 43.7 at around 4pm. 'There's a build up of heat due to the clear sunny days which has allowed heat to build,' said Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott. 'The heat is slowly moving ahead of a slow pressure trough.' 'It's not unusual, it's the summer pattern arriving and we have a lot of moisture in the air,' said Ms Westcott. Earlier she said she expected the western parts of Sydney could break some records with Richmond, which hadn't ever seen a 43 degree day since records dated back to 1993, but that has been smashed. Penrith has also already recorded the hottest November day since 1995. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Peter Zmijewski said we should see a change later Sunday night.

A number of people were also taking to social media to post pics of the fog, including at Terrigal beach (pictured) As Sydney sweltered, families their dogs and horses headed to Yarramundi Recreational Reserve taking advantage of the cool flowing water and the shade . He said a change would move through the west and southwest during the day, 'so some places will feel a little bit of relief towards the late afternoon'. 'We'll see a north easterly wind about the coast and a change tonight at around 8pm,' said Ms Westcott. 'Monday looking at a low pressure trough bringing showers and storms in afternoon and evening but it will still be quite warm.' But the heat stretched far and wide to Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland although it skipped Victoria. Broome hovered just below it's forecast top of 35 degrees at around four oc'lock, Alice Springs surpassed it's top to reach 39 degrees and a usually mild Canberra also surprisingly reached its expected top of 38 degrees. Too hot for the cricket : some brave the heatwave to sit in the sun and watch the cricket at the SCG . Stairway to heaven wrote on instagramer, the sight at Bondi beach (pictured) as it filled up as the heat soared . Much of Queensland's coastal areas reached in the low to mid 30s while Mt Isa sizzled at almost 41 degrees and Adelaide is cruising along below its forecast although the heatwave did make its way to other parts of the state including Coober Pedy and Roxby Downs in the high 30s. The heat has also fuelled 51 fires burning across state, with three fires at watch and act stage. The NSW RFS says they included large grass fires at the central west region, in Parkes, Tullamore and Ungarie (300 hectares) and the mid western highway Weethalle fire (200 hectare). 'Currently there a number of fire crews out at these locations performing water bombing attacks and property protection,' said Matt Sun from the RFS. 'At the Tullamore road fire, residents did not have to relocate and there was no property loss. Crews have been working several hours and we are hopeful of containing them, but will be providing constant updates.' 'There's strong winds but we are expecting southerly changes bit later and will wait to see tomorrow for conditions to ease off.' he said. Tomorrow it's expected a fire ban will be placed on the Central West Plains. The Bureau of Meteorology also forecast a severe fire danger rating for central and southern parts of Western Australia Sunday. The warning remains in place to stay alert and watch for signs of fire, especially smoke and flames advising people to have their bushfire survival plan and kit ready.","Hot weather is stretching right across the nation .

"The BBC provoked outrage yesterday by playing an offensive song propelled into the charts by enemies of Baroness Thatcher. Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead failed to reach the number one spot. The recording, taken from 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, entered the charts at number two and BBC Radio 1's official chart show only played a five second clip of the song. Former defence minister Sir . Gerald Howarth said: ‘Like all Margaret Thatcher’s opponents, the people . behind this song have failed to get to No 1.’ Scroll down for video . Controversial hit: The Wizard Of Oz track which has had a surge of . popularity in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death went to number 2 in . the official charts .

However the man behind the Facebook campaign, Mark Biddiss, said he was 'ecstatic' that the song made the top five. Campaign: Protester Mark Biddiss says he is 'ecstatic' the song hit number two in the charts . It was more than 5,000 sales short of this week's chart-topper Need U (100%) by Duke Dumont featuring A*M*E. The clip played on Radio 1 contained . the controversial lyrics: 'Ding Dong the witch is dead. Which old witch? The wicked witch. Ding Dong, the wicked witch is dead.' Radio 1 presenter Jameela Jamil handed over to music reporter Sinead Garvan, who said: 'Tributes poured in from around the world when (Margaret Thatcher) died, but there were also people throwing street parties across the UK. 'Like much of Margaret Thatcher's political career, this song has divided opinion.' She then outlined that Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper had decided not to play the entire song and invited listeners to log onto the radio station's Newsbeat page to see his reasons. On the page he said: 'I am not going to play it in full but I will play a clip of it. You have very difficult and emotional arguments on both sides of the fence. 'Let's not forget you also have a family that is grieving for a loved one who is yet to be buried.' Biddiss, 39, defended his actions, which he says has seen him receive death threats. He said: 'I'm ecstatic. We have got people talking across the world. 'Hopefully people will start . listening. There is a lot of pent-up frustration and the group was made . up of people mainly over 40 who come from all walks of life who felt . frustrated by Margaret Thatcher's policies and that her history has been . airbrushed after she died. 'She's . being lauded as our greatest ever leader, which is not correct. What . she did in the UK and her policies are very much in evidence today and . caused a lot of pain. 'It has been ridiculous how this has . been portrayed. At the end of the day people were trying to get a . voice. 'That song must have hit a nerve . because people didn't have a voice. They have a voice now. Number one in . Scotland, number one in Wales,' he said. 'I must say the public have been . absolutely supportive. It has been absolutely amazing. It has been worth . the occasional death threat I had and the 'I am a lefty music . producer'- I am a satirist, and that is all,' he added. The BBC played part of the 1939 tune during Radio 1's top 40 countdown, hosted by Jameela Jamil, left.  It was beaten by the week’s biggest selling single, Need U (100%) by Duke Dumont, right, FT A*M*E . When . asked what Baroness Thatcher's children might feel when hearing the . news, he said: 'I don't think they'll be happy but they are aware the . consensus was she divided opinion. 'No . one has been disrespectful to the children and grandchildren. I hope . people show respect when it comes to the funeral. This is a lady, this . is a person.' However Tory MP Philip Davies added: ‘The whole campaign has been small-minded and ridiculous. ‘When you put this lot against the towering achievements of Mrs Thatcher, you see what a pathetic bunch they are.’ The Official Charts Company described . Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead as 'one of the most controversial chart . contenders of all time'. Place in the charts: The song is the shortest top 10 single ever, with the most popular version running to 51 seconds . It entered the charts at number 54 on . Tuesday, the day after Baroness Thatcher's death, and climbed to number . 10 on Wednesday. By Thursday, it had reached number four and was at . number three by Friday. There . was a final rush of 18,000 sales between Friday morning and yesterday, the . Official Charts Company said, but its final total was 52,605 copies - . 5,700 behind Duke Dumont, which achieved 58,321 sales in the past week. An Official Charts Company spokeswoman . said it had been a 'relatively quiet' week for sales however, with the . average sale of a number one in 2012 being just under 106,000 copies. Some Tory MPs demanded the BBC ban . the song - but others warned that politicians should not interfere in . the choice of records played by broadcasters. New . BBC Director General Tony Hall has explained the broadcaster's decision . to only play a five-second clip of the song as part of a news item . during the Radio 1 chart show, saying: 'I personally believe it is . distasteful and inappropriate. 'However . I do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech . is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity.' New director general Tony Hall defended playing the clip, saying: 'I do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity' Former Tory MP Louise Mensch tweeted: 'It's so good to see that #HopeNotHate triumphed and #DingDidnt flopped at the fence. Much like her opponents in life :) #Thatcher' On Friday UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'If you suppress things then you make them popular, so play the b***** thing. If you ban it it will be number one for weeks. 'Personally I think that the behaviour of these yobs - most of whom weren’t even born when Lady Thatcher was in power - is horrible, offensive and disgusting'. Despite . failing to reach the top spot, Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead has broken a . new record by becoming the shortest top 10 single of all time and is . the only one in history to be under a minute long. Punk . song I'm In Love With Margaret Thatcher by the Notsensibles, which was . featured in recent film The Iron Lady, also entered the top 40 yesterday.

"Unique taste: Heston Blumenthal at a party with Pippa Middleton... not drinking his gin . He is one of the most feted chefs in Britain, with an enviable six Michelin stars and a reputation for creating exciting and innovative new tastes. Now Heston Blumenthal has launched a typically exotic gin, infused with tea and lemon. But despite his track record, and a suitably elevated price tag, the drink has just come bottom of an expert taste test. Embarrassingly, his Earl Grey & Lemon Gin even scored considerably lower than Aldi’s own brand budget spirit, which costs less than half as much. Blumenthal said of his drink: ‘The addition of Earl Grey with its aromatic bergamot makes this a spirit with real spirit.’ Expert taster Martin Isark acknowledged that Blumenthal was ‘pushing the boundaries’ with his concoction – but came to the blunt conclusion: ‘It does not work.’ He tested several gins according to four criteria: bottle design, price, the taste neat and with Schweppes tonic water. Only on design did Blumenthal’s product – part of the Heston From Waitrose range for the upmarket supermarket chain – score top marks. It was equally poor served neat or with tonic. Isark gave the £23 bottle just 44 points out of 100, saying: ‘When drunk neat the gin is aggressive from midway to swallow and the Earl Grey blend does not complement the tonic at all well. ‘The botanicals make it flavoured but with the bergamont you have the tea taste there. It does not work on any front.’ In contrast, Aldi’s £9.99 own brand – Oliver Cromwell London Dry – managed to secure fourth spot with 85 points. It scored 15 out of 25 for taste neat and full marks for taste with tonic and for price. Top-ranked was the familiar Beefeater brand, among the cheapest at £14 for a 70cl bottle. The most expensive spirit tested, the £32 City of London Dry, also scored poorly, coming in eighth out of ten. Isark, who conducted the survey for his consumer website Can I Eat It? added that the mixer was important too, saying: ‘If you are a G&T drinker you are wasting your hard-earned cash buying high priced, super premium, elegantly flavoured gin only to pour pronounced quinine-flavoured tonic water into it.’ A Waitrose spokesman said that Heston’s gin was best drunk with Fentimans tonic water. She added: ‘If you do not like Earl Grey or bergamont you may not like this gin. It’s really popular with our customers. It’s all quite subjective. It’s a twist on traditional flavour – that’s the point.’","His Earl Grey & Lemon Gin scored lower than Aldi's own brand spirit .

"Stansted airport is to be sold off after its owner BAA gave up on its long legal battle today. The Spanish company, which recently lost a Court of Appeal ruling over the Essex airport, said it would not make a further appeal and accepts it has to sell it. The Competition Commission (CC) ruled that BAA must dispose of Gatwick, Stansted and one of its Scottish airports following an inquiry into the company’s airport ownership. Given up: Stansted, pictured, will now be sold off after BAA dumped its legal fight to keep it . But BAA had fought it for years saying that Stansted is a completely different operation to Heathrow so it was not breaking competition rules. 'Having carefully considered the Court of Appeal's recent ruling, BAA has decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court and is now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport,' BAA said in a statement. But added: 'We still believe that the CC ruling fails to recognise that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets.' The BAA decision today ends a process which began as far back as March 2007 when the Office of Fair Trading referred BAA airport services to the Competition Commission. Blow: The BAA flag will soon be taken down at Stansted, having already sold Gatwick and Edinburgh . They then ruled that BAA must sell off Gatwick, Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airports in March 2009. Gatwick was sold to Global Infrastructure Partnerships (GIP) in December 2009 and GIP also took over Edinburgh Airport last year. But then BAA mounted a series of legal challenges to the CC ruling, with the latest one - against the sale of Stansted - ending in defeat at the High Court in July this year. After that latest loss, BAA said it would appeal to the Supreme Court but today the Spanish-owned company signalled an end to its fight to hang on to Stansted. BAA, which formerly ran seven UK airports, will have responsibility for just four - Heathrow, Southampton, Glasgow and Aberdeen - once the Stansted sale is concluded.","Competition Commission said the Spanish company must sell the Essex airport to avoid a monopoly .
Until today they pledged to fight it, which has included several legal actions .
BAA has already sold Gatwick and Edinburgh airports and Stansted will now be next ."
"A police officer in Ferguson allowed his dog to urinate on a makeshift memorial for Michael Brown just hours after the teen was gunned down, a new report has claimed. According to Mother Jones, police also drove their patrol cars over the flowers and candles Brown's mother had scattered over the place her son's body fell and laid for more than four hours, crushing them. Reporter Mark Follman says he corroborated the shocking claims with three separate state and local officials who worked with the community in the immediate aftermath of the August 9 shooting. Scroll down for video . Memorial: A police officer allegedly allowed a dog to pee on a makeshift memorial on the spot Michael Brown was killed, pictured here on Sunday August 10 before it was then crushed . He said one of the officials interviewed an eyewitness and pressed the young woman to describe exactly what she saw. 'She said that the officer just let the dog pee on it,' he said the official told him. 'She was very distraught about it.' It's not clear who the officer controlling the dog was or which agency he worked for, according to the report. Missouri state Representative Sharon Pace, whose district includes the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, told Mother Jones that she brought tea light candles for the family the day after Brown's death. She said they scattered the candles and some rose petals on the ground where Brown had died at around 7 p.m. 'They spelled out his initials with rose petals over the bloodstains,' Pace recalled of the teen's mother Lesley McSpadden and other family. McSpadden had earlier been blocked by police from approaching his body. But soon the flowers and candles had been smashed by officers who had blocked off the street to cars other than law enforcement vehicles . 'That made people in the crowd mad and it made me mad,' Pace told the publication, and she added that residents began walking in front of police vehicles to prevent them from driving into the block. Dogs: Police dogs were brought to the scene in an attempt to control protesters. The officer who allegedly allowed his dog to urinate on the memorial has not bee identified. MailOnline is not suggesting it is the officer pictured . Destroyed: This picture taken after the incident and posted on Twitter by Alderman of the 21st Ward of St. Louis Antonio French shows the destroyed memorial . A picture taken after the incident and posted on Twitter by Alderman of the 21st Ward of St. Louis Antonio French shows the destroyed memorial, with the caption 'Police cars trampled the rose petals and candles at the memorial for #MikeBrown.' He also tweeted video of the angry police dogs. The St. Louis County Police said the department was unaware of the incidents. But, if true, they no doubt fueled the violent conflict in Ferguson that rumbled on for two weeks following Brown's shooting.","According to Mother Jones, residents witnessed the cop allowing his dog to urinate on the place where Brown fell and laid for hours the day prior .

"Sian Lloyd, pictured, has written a novel about a ferociously ambitious weather girl who will stop at nothing to get on in television . For as long as she can remember, Sian Lloyd has carried a slim black notebook in which she records her daily observations, and the result is a cupboard at home full of scribblings. An innocuous activity, you might think, if a little dull. But now the weather girl has used her jottings as the basis of a novel in which she intends to lacerate the monstrous egos behind – and in front of – the television cameras. And as Sian has spent 30 years in TV – more than 20 of them as ITV’s main weather presenter – there are plenty of people who might have reason to be concerned. ‘Some of the sweetest people on TV, male and female, are absolute b******* in real life,’ she says, with an outspoken candour. ‘To be blunt, I’ve been well placed to watch egos at play – and I mean people with enormous, killer egos.’ For those who wondered what had happened to 56-year-old Sian after she disappeared from our screens last February amid rumours she’d been sacked, it’s clear she’s spent some time sharpening her quill. ‘I enjoyed the buzz of working on live TV,’ she says, ‘but when it comes to vanity, pomposity and sheer naked ambition, the television industry has no rival. ‘It has been more than interesting to see what people will do to get on in television and I draw upon all of it in my book.’ The novel – provisionally titled Sunshine And Showers and due out next year – is not exactly autobiographical, says Sian. The plot is based on a ferociously ambitious weather girl who will stop at nothing to get on. ‘I like to think I am far nicer than that,’ she says. ‘But the dog-eat-dog world my character inhabits is not a million miles from the truth, and I can’t be blamed if it sets people guessing.’ Ms Lloyd, pictured, spent 30 years on television with two decades as the main weather presenter on ITV . Like her fictional heroine, Sian worked her way up the television ladder, starting as a researcher for the Cardiff Broadcasting Company, before moving to the Met Office after a stint with BBC Wales. She joined ITV in 1990. ‘I’ve enjoyed the ride, even if I’ve been left agog over the lengths my colleagues would go to scale the greasy television pole. It is such an insecure business. Everyone is aware there are hundreds of bright young things snapping at your heels. Ms Lloyd, left, had been previously engaged to former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik . ‘Even so, what people resort to is bizarre. Like make-up being stolen. You will go into make-up, and find your favourite little bit missing, a blusher that you particularly love because it works with the lighting, perhaps. And someone has just taken it… and it’s deliberate.’ Soon after starting on national television, she caught one such make-up thief red-handed. ‘A prominent female presenter, a household name, was rifling through my cosmetics in the green room before a major network light entertainment show,’ says Sian. ‘She was fingering an expensive blusher she was obviously hoping to nobble. ‘Another popular personality was so desperate for exposure that I overheard her asking her agent, without a hint of irony, whether it would be better for her career to support an animal charity or a children’s one. Then there are the mind games. A favourite is trying to throw fellow presenters, standing in their eye line – making a point of standing and watching because there’s nothing worse if you’re on camera. ‘You see big bubbles coming out of their head, full of negativity. Pathetic really – but effective.’ She says the men are little better. ‘I narrowly missed having my bottom groped by a drunken manager at Channel 4 following his Christmas party. I was working and about to step on set. I swerved – leaving him to throw up all over the ornamental coffee table that was part of the set. Seconds later, I was live on air sitting next to a vase covered with vomit.’ ‘I know of one married female star nicknamed after a cleaning product because her favourite risque activity was said to involve polishing the boardroom table… . ‘I’ve never got up to that sort of thing,’ says Sian, who instead can recount some comically hairy moments on air: ‘Like the time I had to spit my chewing gum out after a producer cut to me unexpectedly. Ms Lloyd, left, married entrepreneur Jonathan Ashma seven years ago . ‘All I could do was turn away and try to discreetly cough it into my hand. But I spat it on to the weatherboard instead, leaving an Everest-style protuberance in the Midlands. I had to keep my hands close to Birmingham and hope no one noticed. They did. The next day, I was offered the chance to front an advert for chewing gum.’ She declined. Sian insists that most ego maniacs she has worked with will be too self-obsessed to notice her novel. But she is no stranger to the art of a feud, not least with her former fiance, ex-Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik, who lost his seat in 2010. Opik famously succumbed to the charms of Romanian pop singer and Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia. Sian has previously labelled him ‘a fool’ and ‘tedious’, but today she’s in softer mood. ‘Do you know, I genuinely have no idea what he’s doing these days – he seems to have disappeared into a black hole, which is such a shame because he was a very bright person,’ says Sian, who married entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman seven years ago. ‘I generally feel rather sorry for him, which is not me being supercilious because he genuinely could have made a difference. It’s self destructive, really.’ And last year, it was claimed that Sian had been ‘disinvited’ from stepdaughter Suzanne’s wedding to Tony Blair’s son Euan, amid rumours her anti-Iraq War stance was at issue. Professing herself ‘dumbfounded’ at the time, Sian can shed little further light, saying she remains ‘puzzled’ by those events. On one thing, however, she is entirely clear. She was certainly not sacked by ITV. ‘There was speculation when I left, but I was increasingly getting rid of my shifts or swapping them as I wanted to try new opportunities. My heart was obviously elsewhere so I took the decision to leave. ‘I enjoy working in television, but I couldn’t give a fig if I’m “on TV” or not. I just cared about doing my job properly. I know a lot of people in TV who are still hanging on by their fingertips, and that’s not what I want for me.’","Sian Lloyd is finishing her first novel which is due out next year .

"Callous Paul Lattimore, 39, was jailed for more than three years for fleecing his dementia-stricken great aunt out of £60,000 . A callous thief raided £60,000 from the bank account of his dementia-stricken great aunt after posing as her carer, a court heard. Paul Lattimore, 39, splashed out on a new car and a wide screen television after fleecing his frail relative. His 78-year-old victim was forced to sell her house and move into a care home after her savings were plundered. The thief was jailed for 40 months after he admitted theft and fraud at the Old Bailey. Lattimore became a carer for the vulnerable pensioner, who lived by herself in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, after being released from jail. He used the frail OAP's bank card to withdraw money from the cashpoint and transferred cash into his own account. The thief even paid a deposit for a Volkswagen Golf with her money, and set up a hire purchase agreement for the vehicle against her current account for the £199 monthly repayments. The car was registered in his great aunt's name and he then ran up 40 fines for speeding and driving in bus lanes. Lattimore also signed up to a finance agreement in his great aunt's name for a widescreen TV. He carried out the thefts between April last year and January. Lattimore, also of Wisbech, was snared when his victim told police she thought her money was being taken by her great nephew. He was arrested and refused to answer questions. Lattimore later admitted the theft and fraud at the Old Bailey in London. He was jailed for 40 months and the goods he had fraudulently acquired were forfeited. Detective Constable Ralph King, of Cambridgeshire Police, was also commended by the judge for his work on the case. Det Con King said: ""Lattimore callously took advantage of his vulnerable relative, who does not live near other members of her family. ""The victim was forced to sell her home to help towards her losses and is now settled in a care home. ""These were appalling offences and I hope the jail sentence reassures the victim and her family that justice has been done.""

"A windsurfer was pulled dead from the water after onlookers today spotted his equipment in the sea near Portsmouth. The alarm was raised at 12.15pm after a dinghy spotted windsurfing gear in water just outside Langstone Harbour. The Hayling Island Coastguard Rescue Team, the Coastguard helicopter from Lee-on-the-Solent, three RNLI lifeboats were sent to the scene, along with police and ambulance crews. A windsurfer was pulled dead from the water after onlookers today spotted his equipment in the sea just outside Langstone Harbour in Portsmouth . A man was later found face down in the water and was pulled onto a boat and taken to the shore. The man was then flown by the Coastguard helicopter to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham, Portsmouth, where he was pronounced dead. The man's name is yet to be released. A spokeswoman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said very little was known about the circumstances leading to the man's death, other than the fact he was windsurfing with a friend at the time. She said the conditions were not unlikely to be a factor in the death as wind gusts had been mild in the area.","Rescuers were called after windsurfing gear was spotted in the sea .

"He travels the world on official royal duty and sees more in a year than most do in lifetime. But could it be possible that the Prince of Wales does not know what a skip is? Prince Charles was visiting the National Heritage Garden in the ground of Raymond Blanc's country house and restaurant yesterday when the subject of skips arose. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles, pictured with Raymond Blanc, was visiting the National Heritage Garden in the ground of Raymond Blanc's country house and restaurant yesterday when the subject of skips arose . The Prince was shown the garden's compost heap, made out of old pallets, and was 'very interested' in the design - according to David Love Cameron, who won a competition to work in the garden for a year. Mr Love Cameron told The Times: 'He loved the fact that we use shipping pallets, and wanted to know where you get them from. 'I said you could probably find some in a skip if you looked hard enough but I'm not quite sure he knew what a skip was.' During his visit Prince Charles admired the way in which the garden's compost heap was constructed. He was told the design was made using old shipping pallets - but would he have known what a pallet was? When Dragons' Den star Hilary Devey appeared on The Graham Norton Show in 2011, she was forced to explain to bemused guests including Mcfly member Dougie Poynter what a pallet was. The businesswoman, 57, made her fortune from pallet company, Pall-Ex. During the visit the Prince enthusiastically inspected the vegetables growing in the garden and also revealed his favourite mushroom was the birch boletus. The National Heritage Garden at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, has almost 140 rare specimens of vegetable including the Delicata squash and the Carruthers pea. The site was opened last June to showcase rare varieties of vegetables and educate people about gardening. It is run in partnership with garden Organic, and their Heritage Seed Library, which conserves vegetable varieties that would otherwise have disappeared. The Prince, who has been a patron of garden organic for more than 25 years, was given some peas from Northern Ireland which had all but died out before being saved by gardeners. Perplexed: Gardener David Love Cameron suggested Prince Charles appeared to not know what a skip was . He planted an organic fruit tree to commemorate the visit and was heard telling Raymond Blanc 'you're a genius' as he inspected the specimens, the BBC reports. During the visit Prince Charles was also persuaded to taste the leaves of a plant called Stevia, a natural sweetener. 'He was completely amazed a plant could be so sweet.' said restaurateur Mr Blanc.

"Wealthy pensioners should be stripped of their winter fuel allowance to fund cheaper bus fares for young people, a Liberal Democrat Minister claimed yesterday.

Speaking at her party’s Scottish conference, she said the Lib Dems were suggesting that the winter fuel allowance ‘should not be going to all pensioners and all wealthy pensioners. ‘That is something which is very difficult to justify when there are so many other difficult decisions being made.’ The plan would be to give ‘two-thirds discount to young people in terms of bus travel, and to pay for that partly by the winter fuel payments actually being taken away from wealthy pensioners who can afford it,’ Ms Swinson said. Instead she suggests cutting the payments and using the spare cash to help young people get to college or work with a two-thirds discount on bus fares (file image)","Jo Swinson said payments of up to £300 per person were hard to justify .

"Although the charges were thrown out, Ms Kidson and her daughter – who cannot be named for legal reasons – have not seen each other since April and can only speak on monitored calls . A mother falsely accused of poisoning her teenage daughter has issued a heartfelt plea to social workers to let her child return home. Mary Kidson, 55, was acquitted last month of attempting to poison the 16-year-old – an accusation which followed her attempt to find medical help abroad. The case echoes that of young cancer patient Ashya King, whose parents were arrested after removing him from Southampton Hospital for treatment outside the UK. Although the charges were thrown out, Ms Kidson and her daughter – who cannot be named for legal reasons – have not seen each other since April and can only speak on monitored calls. A care order, imposed when Ms Kidson was detained last year, remains in place despite the trial judge at Worcester Crown Court saying the girl would be ‘psychologically harmed’ by the separation. Now an e-petition on Change.org has collected 1,830 signatures and urges social services and the courts to return the girl to her mother. ‘All my child and I want is for her to come home,’ Ms Kidson said last night. ‘Social workers are ruining my daughter’s life. She was studying for four GCSE equivalent qualifications and a Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, but that has all stopped because of what’s happened. ‘We speak on the phone but the calls are listened to. It’s unbearable. She was so happy with me, and to think of how she is living, without her mother, is just heartbreaking.’ The mother of two, from Ledbury, Herefordshire, added: ‘It’s supposed to be innocent until proven guilty but in my case it seems I’m guilty despite being proved innocent. ‘The care order was drawn up before anyone had heard any of the evidence. The grief I am feeling now at being denied access to my daughter is very hard to bear.’ The Daily Mail report from earlier this month on the case that echoes that of young cancer patient Ashya King . Ms Kidson’s troubles began in 2012 when, after failing to find treatment in Britain, she took her daughter, then aged 14, to the Brussels clinic of Dr Thierry Hertoghe, a physician and expert in hormone therapy. The girl had suffered from constant tiredness, low blood pressure, muscle and joint pain, and growth problems, which often left her bedridden. Ms Kidson believed she had chronic fatigue syndrome. But in March last year, without having made contact with Ms Kidson, police and social workers arrived at their home, arrested her and took her daughter away. The medication the teenager had been prescribed was stopped by doctors and she was put into foster care. In January, Ms Kidson was charged with poisoning her child and unlawfully causing grievous bodily harm. The initial complaint is believed to have been made by her ex-husband Michael, the girl’s father. But it was when Ms Kidson responded to a text from her daughter in April – after becoming worried she may harm herself – that she was imprisoned for breach of bail. Her daughter, traumatised by the events, according to Ms Kidson, was certified under the Mental Health Act. She remains in hospital. Hereford Council said: ‘We can’t comment on individual cases. The council is in contact with both parents about the next steps.’","Mary Kidson, 55, acquitted last month of attempting to poison daughter .

"Forget Johnny Knoxville, one young prankster has become a social media sensation after filming herself playing Jackass-style jokes - on her own mother. Kelly Mai Webb, 22, secretly uses her mobile phone to capture herself pelting her mother Jackie Webb, 52, with eggs and hot dogs before posting her videos on Facebook. In one incident, Kelly recreated any mother's worst nightmare by poring sugar in a plastic bag and falsely claimed to a horrified Jackie she was a cocaine dealer - before admitting she had made it up. Scroll down for video . Kelly Mai Webb has become a hit om social networks after filming herself pranking her mum Jackie Webb . The collection of videos of long-suffering Jackie being pranked - usually as she innocently watches TV on the sofa - have become a smash hit on social media site with more than 250,000 hits. And Kelly who lives in Blackpool has even been recognised in the street by fans of her films - with one woman even asked if she could have a selfie taken with her. Kelly, a healthcare assistant who has a young sister aged ten called Libby, says that she loves the light-hearted nature of the videos and saw a gap in the market to start her own. Kelly has previously thrown eggs, hotdogs and trifle at her mother usually while she is relaxing on the sofa . Jackie says that Kelly has been a hand-full from a young age and was always getting in trouble at school . 'I just love watching pranks online because they always make me laugh. One evening I was sitting watching funny YouTube videos when I realised there are no female pranksters. 'It's always the blokes like Johnny Knoxville and Dom Joly getting all the limelight and making people laugh so I thought why not? 'I started filming myself doing pranks and uploading them on my Facebook page and within weeks I was getting thousands of views.' Kelly, who doesn't live with her mum but visits four times a week, admits that some of her previous tricks have been a bit harsh. Kelly captures all of her videos on her mobile and uploads them to her Facebook page . 'Some of the pranks I do are a bit mean, and people do tell me they are disgusted in me but I make them laugh. 'The worst one I ever did was when I put sugar in a plastic bag and told my mum I was dealing cocaine. 'She was so upset that I thought she was going to call the police so I had to tell her I was joking. I also threw hotdogs at mum whilst she was sitting watching a Bushtucker trial in I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. 'My mum does get annoyed with me pulling pranks on her. My personality is outrageous and I know that, but I just love making people laugh.' Kelly says that although her mum doesn't always find her jokes funny she has had plenty of praise from everyone else. Kelly was inspired to start filming her tricks after she realised there were very few female pranksters . 'I was on a night out in Blackpool and these Norwegian guys came over and said they had seen my videos, and a couple of weeks ago I was going through a McDonald's drive-through in Preston and a woman noticed me and asked if she could have a selfie with me. 'She said she loved my videos and that my mum made her laugh. It was so good to know I'm making people smile with my pranks. 'I would love my own TV show where I could go round pulling pranks on people.' Jackie who works as an admin assistant says that Kelly has been mischievous from a young age. Kelly's videos have become so popular that she has even been recognised in the street . 'Kelly is a handful. She has always been a nutcase. I've got all of her reports from when she was at school and she was always getting in trouble, not for anything really bad, just for silly things. 'Kelly's dad and I would sometimes sit on the sofa and try and work out what is wrong with her. She never gave us a minute's peace. She's got worse as she's got older. I've never met anybody like her. 'She never shuts up and she is always winding me up. I love her to pieces but she's so annoying. It would be nice if she just came round to see me, but every time she comes round she has to do something silly like these video pranks. Sometimes I dread her coming round because I just don't know what tricks she's got up her sleeve.' Jackie added that no matter how many pranks Kelly plays on her she still believes everything her daughter says. 'The awful thing is that I believe everything she says - she's like The Boy Who Cried Wolf. It will probably get to the point where I will have to ban her from coming to the house. 'When Kelly pranks me I get really annoyed and upset. Sometimes I do feel fed up, but a couple of days after Kelly shows me the videos and I do see the funny side and we have a laugh together.' Jackie says that although Kelly receives plenty of compliments for her videos online not everyone agrees that she is funny. 'Kelly tells me she gets all these comments and things on Facebook but I don't use social media so I don't know what people are saying. 'She says people find the videos hilarious, but a few of my friends think she's disgusting. They say ""how can you let her humiliate you like that?"" 'My younger daughter Libby is only ten but she's more grown up than Kelly. She's quiet, she's the absolute opposite of her and she's always telling Kelly to grow up. She says ""She's pathetic, Mum, just ignore her."" 'I have been in the shops a few times when I have seen people looking at me, and a couple of people have said ""Are you Kelly's mum? We've seen you in her videos."" I can't believe I am being recognised for these silly pranks.'","Kelly Mai Webb films herself playing tricks on her mum Jackie Webb .

"A scandal-hit hospital  has been branded one of the worst in England after the number of patient complaints reportedly doubled in the last year. Colchester General Hospital is also  facing a shortfall of 170 nurses, it has been claimed. It comes just weeks after a 'major incident' was declared at the hospital and all but the most seriously ill patients were told to stay away from its A&E department. Colchester General Hospital, pictured above, is facing a shortfall of 170 nurses, it has been claimed . A total of 2,997 patients raised concerns about poor treatment last year - or eight a day - up from 1,592 in the previous year, according to figures published in The Sun. Dr Katherine Rake, head of Healthwatch England, told the newspaper: 'In the last year Colchester has gone from mid-table to one of the worst hospitals in the country'. And the Royal College of Nursing has said the hospital needs to fill a shortfall of 170 nurses, the newspaper claimed. Colchester General Hospital was put into special measures last November after a Care Quality Commission report found the records of 22 cancer patients out of a sample of 61 had been altered to disguise ‘extensive delays for treatment’. Police were asked to probe claims staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to alter waiting times. The CQC carried out a surprise inspection earlier this month after receiving ‘information of concern’. It comes just weeks after a 'major incident' was declared at the hospital and all but the most seriously ill patients were told to stay away from its A&E department . This led to the trust announcing a ‘major incident’ and all but the most seriously ill patients being barred from A&E. It is now only handling urgent cases after a surprise inspection found staff swamped by ‘unprecedented demand’. A Department of Health source told the Daily Mail earlier this month that the trust has suffered from long-term problems, stemming largely from weak management. On Wednesday, Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell, who met with hospital bosses and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt the day before, said he was optimistic the current situation 'will be resolved within a few days'. A review in 2010 also found that in four of the five previous years, Colchester Hospital reported higher than expected death rates.","Scandal-hit hospital has reportedly seen patient complaints nearly double .

"The Australian Open is in full swing with home-grown talent getting off to a great start but it’s not just the game that everyone’s eyes have been fixed on – the fluorescent fashion is simply unavoidable. The world’s top players are making the most of the tournament’s relaxed dress regulations and donning bright yellow, greens, oranges, pinks and purples on the court as the year’s first grand slam gets under way. When playing at Wimbledon  players are required to wear all-white, a rule that was initially introduced in 1890 and updated in 1995 to clarify that players must wear ‘almost entirely white’ but are allowed a coloured trim of 1cm width. But at the Australian Open pros can ‘express themselves’ in any colour they - or their sponsors - choose. Scroll down for video . Eugenie Bouchard of Canada (left) donned a bright pink top and skirt combo while Victoria Azarenka of Belarus (right) wore high-vis yellow from her shoes to her sweatbands . Rules simply stipulate that players can only have two commercial logos on their clothing which must be 'clean and customarily acceptable tennis attire'. Pros view the fun summer tournament as a chance to stand out on the court. But are they also donning the brightest colours as some kind of distraction technique against their opponents? Or are they purely making fashion statements? Roger Rasheed, a former Australian tennis player turned coach,  ruled out the colours had anything to do with stunning opponents. He told Daily Mail Australia ‘coaches don’t get involved’ in what players wear. Meanwhile, former model and fashion expert Kate Peck said the stars ‘look great’ and their outfits are all about ‘adding another dimension to the game’. ‘It’s hard to be in a bad mood or get too serious when you are wearing outfits such as those, it’s a nice thing to have at the Australian Open to add some flair and fun and that vibe in such a serious environment,’ Peck told Daily Mail Australia. Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis entertained crowds on the first day of the Australian Open in his bold head-to-toe fluoro . The prize for the brightest outfit on day one of the Australian Open went to  Kokkinaki who sealed an astonishing win against the world’s No.13 Latvian Ernests Gulbis . Spanish player Rafeal Nadal dazzled in a bright pink t-shirt and fluoro yellow sweatbands when he won his first match at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon following injury and illness on Monday. While Swiss star Roger Federer stood out in a high-vis t-shirt, along with Andy Murray in a fetching lime green top. But the prize for the brightest outfit of all went to Australia’s rising star Thanasi Kokkinaki who sealed an astonishing win against the world’s No.13 Latvian Ernests Gulbis while wearing eye-popping, head- to-toe fluoro. The 18-year-old from Adelaide, who is ranked 147th in the world, stunned the crowd and served his way out of an early exit of the tennis tournament in a pink and yellow outfit. Peck advised that while neon colours are on trend in sports fashion at the moment, ‘too much colour blocking can be a little heavy on the eye… but some of their details and patterns are pretty cool.’ Roger Federer (left) of Switzerland celebrates match point in his first round match against Yen-Hsun Lu of Chinese Taipei at Melbourne Park and Rafael Nadal of Spain (right) plays a backhand in his first round match against Mikhail Youzhny of Russia .

"Heartbreaking: Luke's temperature spiked and he suffered another huge bleed - close to a second litre - on April 6th and he went into cardiac arrest . A seven-year-old boy died in a short-staffed hospital ward on Good Friday because nurses were 'unconcerned' about a massive internal bleed following surgery, an inquest heard today. Luke Jenkins, who was born with half a heart, went into hospital to have his third and final corrective operation at Bristol Children’s Hospital on March 30 2012. But a report revealed that a series of errors - including staff being unaware where the resuscitation equipment was when he suffered cardiac arrest - contributed to his death. Luke was expected to make a full recovery, but he lost almost two litres of blood following the operation. He . was moved out of intensive care and into a high dependency unit a day . after the operation - despite his parent’s claim they were told he should . remain there for three days. His . mother Faye Valentine and father Stephen Jenkins noticed that Luke . suffered a huge bleed - around a litre - from a draining tube just three . days after his operation, . In . a harrowing statement read in court, his father Stephen, 31, said: 'We called . the nurse and asked her to look. She said it was ok, it was old blood. 'The . nurses did not seem bothered by this and kept walking out of the room. Nurses were just looking at a monitor and writing things down on notes . but not making any changes. 'Every time we had to ask nurses for pain relief because they were not checking.' Mr . Jenkins told the inquest nurses reset potentially vital alarms, which . monitored Luke’s condition, to lower the trigger threshold. He said: 'We were left for long periods of time before anyone would come and see what was going on. 'After an hour [of the alarm] the nurse came and put the bag [containing fluid] in the machine. 'I explained to her and she said it was disgusting and she was going to note it.' Tragic: Mr Jenkins told the inquest nurses reset potentially vital alarms, which monitored Luke's condition, to lower the trigger threshold . Bleed: Luke was expected to make a full recovery, but he lost almost two litres of blood following the operation at Bristol Children's Hospital . Panic: His mother Faye Valentine and father Stephen Jenkins (left) noticed that Luke suffered a huge bleed - around a litre - from a draining tube just three days after his operation . Luke’s temperature spiked and he suffered another huge bleed - close to a second litre - on April 6th and he went into cardiac arrest. But junior staff on the ward did not know where a vital piece of resuscitation equipment was kept. Stephen, a student, has been unable to leave his home in Cardiff due to psychological problems following Luke’s death. But his statement, read to the inquest in Flax Bourton, Bristol, told of the frantic efforts to save Luke’s life. He said: 'We were left in the room holding the oxygen mask to his face. There didn’t seem to be any organisation of what was supposed to be done. Everyone seemed to panic.' Harrowing: His mother Faye Valentine and father Stephen Jenkins gave harrowing statements to the court about their son's final hours. Stephen, a student, has been unable to leave his home in Cardiff due to psychological problems following Luke's death . Loved: Brain scans showed Luke had suffered serious damage and, with his family surrounding him for an emotional Christening service, Luke died on April 9 - just ten days after his surgery . Luke’s chest was opened in an effort to bring him back to life, but his heart stopped for more than 40 minutes. Brain scans showed Luke had suffered serious damage and, with his family surrounding him for an emotional Christening service, Luke died on April 9 - just ten days after his surgery. Getting better: Luke was born with a congenital heart defect and had already had two of the three corrective operations before he was taken to Bristol Children¿s Hospital for the third . A report, published shortly after Luke’s death, found that staff shortages were partly to blame for the tragedy. The root cause analysis, put together by an investigative team at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, said 'the workload and patient dependency is recognised as being significant' in Luke’s death. When Luke collapsed on his ward, junior staff did not know where a vital piece of resuscitation equipment was kept. The report said a risk assessment . which had previously been carried out identified 'low and unsafe nurse . staffing for a cardiac high dependency unit'. Pathologist . Liina Kiho, who performed the post mortem, recorded a cause of death of . hypoxic ischemic brain injury, caused by post operative bleeding, due . to a congenital heart defect, contributed to by a failure to thrive. Luke . was born with a congenital heart defect and had already had two of the . three corrective operations before he was taken to Bristol Children’s . Hospital for the third. The . court heard how Luke’s parents wanted Luke to be treated at BCH - despite . concerns about previous treatment - because cardiologist Andrew Parry . was to carry out the operation. But . on examining their son’s notes following his death, the family . discovered a different doctor led the operation, with Dr Parry providing . assistance because he would not be around for follow up checks due to a . booked holiday. Dr Parry . told the inquest he did not believe the surgery caused the bleed - but . could offer no clear answer as to how Luke came to lose so much blood. He . said: 'I am fastidious in my surgical technique and even if I had been . even the slightest bit concerned about it I would have made sure it was . perfect.' After giving . evidence, Dr Parry choked back tears while he apologised to Luke’s mother . for apparently telling her he would be the lead surgeon. He said: 'I’m sorry about the consult. It was never my intent.' The inquest continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Luke Jenkins was born with half a heart and already had two corrective ops .

"A hapless taxi driver had to be rescued after plunging his car into a canal while waiting for a fare outside a restaurant. Emergency services were called to Castro's Restaurant in Chedderton, Staffordshire at 10.30pm on Friday night after reports of a vehicle in the water. When they arrived they found a Toyota Avensis almost completely submerged in the Caldon Canal after it somehow managed to land in the middle of the four foot deep water. The taxi somehow ended up in the middle of the Caldon Canal in Chedderton, Staffordshire while the driver was waiting for a fare . When emergency services arrived at the scene they found the Toyota Avensis almost completely submerged . Restaurant owner Jamie Bateman, 38, said police, paramedics and firefighters all turned up at the scene after the car ended up submerged. Mr Bateman, who has run the restaurant for 11 years said: 'I was in the kitchen at about half 10 when some of the staff came in and told me there was a car in the canal. 'A local man got into the water and got the driver out before the emergency services arrived and we took him into the office for a cup of tea while he was getting dry. 'I've never seen anything like it before, there were flashing lights everywhere like some kind of terrorist attack. There were emergency services everywhere. 'It was dark on Friday but I just don't know how the taxi driver managed to do it. It was like something from the Dukes of Hazzard or a Carry On Film. 'You would think he would have dropped in from the edge but he must have taken off as he was right in the middle of the canal. A local man jumped into the water to rescue the driver before a lorry came and lifted the taxi from the canal . 'Everyone came out to take photographs of what was happening, even other taxi drivers. It was quite amusing really and we're glad the driver is OK. 'He was obviously a little shaken but he wasn't injured.' Police, firefighters and ambulance crews attended the scene and spent more than two hours removing the car from the water which was from Roseville Taxis, based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. A spokesman from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Two pumps from Leek and a pump from Newcastle were called to Cheadle Lane, in Cheddleton, at about 10.40pm on Friday, November 21. 'Firefighters prepared themselves with wetsuits but the driver of the car was already out of the vehicle on arrival. 'The man was receiving treatment from the ambulance service. Crews left the scene at just after 11pm.'","Taxi ended up plunging into the canal as the driver waited for a fare .

"Nathan Jones, who has been jailed for stealing his grandmother's Fiat Punto and leading police on a 90mph chase . A drugged up motorist who stole his grandmother's car and led police on a 90mph chase before crashing into trees has been jailed for two years. Nathan Jones suffered near fatal injuries, while his girlfriend Tiana Ajdoha was left with a broken pelvis in the smash New Year's Day last year, after driving the car through the streets of Sheffield. Sheffield Crown Court heard how the 21-year-old stole a Fiat Punto belonging to his grandmother at a family party on New Year’s Eve 2012. He drove his girlfriend and some friends to the home of Jodie Holliday, Miss Ajdoha’s best friend. After realising the car was stolen, Miss Holliday begged Jones to get out, but, while the other men got out, he drove off with Miss Ajdoha still inside. Brian Outhwaite, prosecuting, said police were alerted and officers spotted the Fiat in Broomhill area at 3am, where they activated their lights and sirens. He said Jones sped through traffic lights at 70mph in a 30mph zone along Penistone Road and Halifax Road towards Grenoside. He reached speeds of up to 90mph in a 50mph limit, went through a red light, overtook other motorists and then undertook a driver before crashing into trees when he failed to negotiate a bend. Mr Outhwaite said Jones and his girlfriend, who had both been smoking cannabis, were trapped in the wreckage. He explained: 'It was a prolonged incident of dangerous driving over three miles.' Peter Hampson, defending,, said Jones suffered bleeding on the brain which could have proved fatal. When interviewed by police, Jones said he could not recall anything after Christmas Day. He admitted aggravated vehicle taking and causing serious injury to his passenger by dangerous driving. Mr Hampson said Miss Ajdoha had made a good recovery and was in court supporting her boyfriend. He said: 'It is fortunate the incident was not worse, the most damage he caused was to himself.' He added Jones’ head injury had affected his cognitive behaviour and memory and he was still having treatment. Jones was sentenced to two years in prison and was banned for driving for five years at Sheffield Crown Court . Sentencing, Judge Peter Kelson QC said the incident had been a ‘wake-up call’ for Jones, but he had ignored pleas to get out of the car and the cannabis ‘perhaps’ influenced his judgment. Jones, who only holds a provisional licence, was jailed for two years and banned from driving for five. Sergeant Steve Askham, from South Yorkshire Police’s serious collisions unit, said: 'This collision was completely avoidable. 'A member of the public felt the need to dial 999 about the standard of his driving and, when requested to stop by a police officer, Jones should have simply pulled over and stopped. 'The serious injuries caused to both himself and his passenger could have been avoided, as well as the risk posed to the public and the significant resources from the three emergency services utilised to deal with this incident.'","Nathan Jones stole his grandmother's Fiat Punto on New Year's Day 2013 .

"Survivor: At 107 Austrian born Mr Engleitner is the world's oldest known holocaust survivor, and has had a film made about his unfailing faith . Handed a simple sheet of paper Leopold Engleitner was given a choice - renounce your faith, or face death in a concentration camp. With a flick of ink, the Jehovah's Witness could have saved himself from his unknown fate, a fate which saw him starved and forced to labour in not one but three Nazi prisoner camps. He refused. At 107 Austrian born Mr Engleitner is the world's oldest known holocaust survivor, and has had a film made about his unfailing faith. Now Mr Engleitner will be guest of honour at the film's LA screening where with help of an interpreter, he will be talking to audience members. Ladder in the Lions' Den charts Engleitner's journey as survivor of three concentration camps, Buchenwald, Niederhagen and Ravensbrueck. Born in 1905 with a curved spine and raised in a village not far from where Hitler grew up, the young Engleitner was horrified by the atrocities of World War I and joined the pacifist religious movement in the early 1930s. When Austria joined the German Reich in 1938, Jehovah's Witnesses were rounded up and unlike their Jewish counterparts, given a choice. They would be allowed to get out of the camps if they signed a paper - the Ladder in the Lions' Den - turning their back on their religion and joining the Nazis. According to the film, the Austrian Witnesses, including Engleitner, refused to do so, with many losing their lives. The film charts their story, and details Engleitner's own horrific ordeal. When Austria joined the German Reich in . 1938, Jehovah's Witnesses were rounded up and unlike their Jewish . counterparts, given a choice - your faith or your life . Trapped: Prisoners in block 61 of Buchenwald concentration camp in April 1945. The construction of Buchenwald camp started 15 July 1937 and was liberated by US General Patton's army 11 April 1945 . One scene documents the time when, starving on a march back to camp from hard labour, his testicle was crushed by an SS guard's boot, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports. The incident prevented . him from ever fathering children. Determined: Witnesses were told they would be allowed to get out of the camps if they turned their back on their religion. Engleitner refused . The documentary's narrator and script-editor, Frederic Fuss, said that among the things that captivated him from the beginning was 'the strength of Leopold's unbroken will and determination never diminished his positive outlook, and the intensity of his trial never made him bitter'. He added: 'Ladder in the Lions' Den takes a slice of Leo's experiences and puts them into a more direct historical context. 'You get to the significance of the stand he took as a conscientious objector, not going along with Nazism and and its ideals. 'The name Ladder in the Lions' Den is about Leo's experience as a Jehovah's Witness in the camps. 'A document was regularly presented to the Jehovah's Witnesses, who were conscientious objectors and who objected to the principles of Nazism, and they did not subscribe to any of the racist ideas. 'To get out of the camp, they were told 'just sign this document where you renounce your beliefs, say you go along with Nazism and go along with Hitler'. 'They [Jehovah's Witnesses] would also not say the 'Heil Hitler' greeting, and the film comments on that, that the words ascribe salvation to Hitler. 'They said, no, he's not God so we're not going to do that.' The survivor is still active and tours schools around his home country telling children 'You don’t need to go along with peer pressure, you can stick by your conscience.' Survivor: Leopold Engleitner survived three concentration camps including Ravensbruck (pictured) Horrific ordeal: Despite living through terrible times at three concentration camps including Niederhagen (pictured), Mr Engleitner is still active and tours schools around his home country .","Leopold Engleitner was given a choice - renounce your faith, or face death in a concentration camp .

"Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant,64, is the MP for the strait-laced Staffordshire cathedral city of Lichfield . There are colourful MPs. And there’s Michael Fabricant. His Commons office, preposterously modelled on the White House Oval Office, is a riot of red, white and blue giant Union Flags, Stars And Stripes banners. There is a ukulele on his desk. His hair is an ‘enhanced’ yellow, straw like thatch. He is wearing pink and blue socks. Even they pale into insignificance when he opens his mouth. He no sooner has a Technicolor thought than he blurts it out, or tweets it. It got him sacked as Tory vice chairman earlier this year when, bizarrely, he tweeted about having sex with a llama and disowned a Conservative Minister in an expenses scandal and the HS2 rail link. Simultaneously. Fabricant’s latest battle is with John Bercow who tried to ban him from a gay rights reception at the Speaker’s official residence a few weeks ago – only to be shamed into backing down by a Fab tweet. Fabricant saw it as a lame attempt by Bercow to repay him for exposing how the Speaker told a senior Commons official to ‘f*** off’. ‘One minute it was “you appalling little s***, don’t ever darken our door”, next it was “what we meant is, of course you’re welcome”.’ So perhaps I should not be surprised to be sitting in his Commons office as the exotic MP for the strait-laced Staffordshire cathedral city of Lichfield: . Openly discusses intimate details of his sex life and his relationship with soulmate Andy Street, boss of John Lewis. Reveals how ‘xenophobic and homophobic’ fellow Tory MPs made him want to vote for Tony Blair. Jokes about his ‘bromance’ with Michael Gove and the ‘Heinrich Himmler’ antics of Tory chairman Grant Shapps. Fabricant had cause to be annoyed by Bercow’s attempt to exclude him from the reception for Pink News. The gay rights website wanted to thank Fabricant for calling for curbs on gay blood donors to be scrapped. The MP puts it as only he can: ‘If you are a straight guy screwing three girls a night and never use a condom, you can give blood. But if you are a gay bloke in a monogamous relationship having safe sex, unless you sign an affidavit that you have been celibate for 12 months, you can’t. ‘I mean, come on!’ he guffaws. ‘Most gay people I know can barely be celibate for 12 hours.’ It is not always easy to tell Fabricant’s campaigns and quips apart. But there is no mistaking his loathing of Bercow – ‘petty and volatile, needs an anger management course’. Beneath his flamboyance and Twitterings, being the Jewish son of a Second World War intelligence officer who became a rabbi after learning of the Holocaust left its mark. Hear him scoff at the way he was fired by Shapps earlier this year: ‘He was only obeying orders, as Himmler would have said.’ Hitler’s henchman Heinrich Himmler ran the death camps that traumatised Fabricant’s father – though the jibe is clumsy, to say the least, bearing in mind Shapps is also from a Jewish family. Fabricant clammed up when asked about his hair, other than to admit that it was 'enhanced' On a slightly lesser scale, on entering politics in 1992 after making a pile selling equipment to foreign radio stations, Fabricant junior was shocked by the ‘xenophobic, misogynistic and homophobic’ Tory benches. Imitating a pukkah colonel’s voice, he recalls in disgust a debate on ending the ban on gays in the Armed Forces in which a fellow Conservative MP warned: ’We’ll have soldiers in pink feather boas proposing to each other.’ ‘If I hadn’t been a Tory MP in the 1997 Election, I would probably have voted for Tony Blair,’ he says. New Labour tried to tempt Fabricant to defect but he refused, saying, to derision from most, that he would wait until a ‘New Tory’ party came round to his ‘liberal’ views on gays, ethnic minorities and women’s rights. Eventually it did. Many at Westminster deride him as more twit than Twitter. But there was nothing silly about being among the first Tories to warn David Cameron of the ‘foolishness’ of dismissing Ukip as ‘fruitcakes, closet racists andloonies’. Or about his recent behind-the-scenes intervention to stop young Commons interns being preyed on. Fabricant, a preternaturally boyish 64, has never married, and shares a remote £300,000 Snowdonia holiday home with his very close friend of nearly 25 years, Andy Street, chief executive of John Lewis. Fabricant met Street, 13 years his junior, when Street heckled him during a speech at Oxford University. A mutual love of walking turned into a different type of John Lewis partnership – though Fabricant has been criticised for using his position as an MP to defend Street’s Middle England shopping empire. He loyally leapt to his defence on Twitter last month when the Street was forced to apologise for calling France ‘sclerotic, downbeat and hopeless.’ Fabricant (left) described John Lewis boss, Andy Street (left), who he shared a holiday home with,  as a close friend . Are they an item? ‘No,’ laughs Fabricant. ‘Frankly, if we lived together we would murder each other!’ He reflects sincerely: ‘I have gone past the stage of wanting girlfriends and all the rest of it. I guess he’s someone I can rely on in life and he can rely on me.’ Before meeting Street, Fabricant had relationships with women, including an American girl who came back to the UK with him after he met her studying in California. But he has no regrets at not marrying. ‘I have always run away from responsibilities like babies and things. It’s rather selfish actually. In my 30s I was abroad a lot – and I enjoy the company of blokes. I’m not exclusively gay [though] I have certainly done things with a bloke.’ The unconventional and almost alarmingly candid Mr Fabricant states he has only had full sexual intercourse with women, not men, though the explicit terms he uses to describe it would make readers of Pink News blush, never mind The Mail on Sunday’s. He and Mr Street are content to have a relationship that does not involve such intimacy, he says. Fabricant, pictured in the House of Commons, revealed that he is having a 'bromance' with Michael Gove . ‘We can be friends without having him do things to my ****** or me to his, for God’s sake!’ he roars with metrosexual abandon. However, he is keen to point out he does have an active sex life. ‘I get it in one form or another quite regularly, I can tell you,’ he chuckles. ‘All my bits and pieces work… They haven’t fallen off through lack of use.’ But not with Mr Street. ‘I give Andy a hug occasionally and he stands there rigid with embarrassment,’ he laughs. Most people are not exclusively gay or straight, elaborates Mr Fabricant, but are ‘on a form of the [bisexual] spectrum, though whether they do anything about it is another matter.’ Unsurprisingly, his Cabinet favourites include fellow Tory free spirit and moderniser Michael Gove. ‘I’m having a bromance with Michael,’ he grins. Less predictably, another is close friend and bluff Derbyshire ex-miner Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, the least likely Tory Cabinet Minister to read Pink News. There is only one subject that makes Mr Fabricant clam up – his ludicrous barnet. More like flax than real hair, and a lurid yellow from a child’s paint box, MPs swear it is a wig. A telltale 2in gap appears between the stiff tufts on his collar and the nape of his neck when he leans forward. ‘It’s not as simple as that,’ he replies coyly. All he will say is that it is ‘enhanced’. Implants? Wig? Dyed? Bald silence. It is one area where he is not coming out. For all the Notting Hill modernity of today’s Conservatives, some traditionalists will share the view of Tory grandee Sir Anthony Royle, who interviewed young tyro Fabricant in the late 1970s. ‘You’d make a marvellous MP,’ he declaimed, somewhat to Fabricant’s surprise. ‘Have you tried the Liberal Party?’ Fabricant was sacked as Tory vice chairman earlier this year .","Michael Fabricant, 64, is the Tory MP for Lichfield, Staffordshire .

"An undercover policeman planted a bomb in a department store to prove his commitment to animal rights extremists, an MP claimed yesterday. Bob Lambert is accused of leaving an incendiary device in a Debenhams in London – one of three set off in a coordinated attack in 1987. Caroline Lucas, leader of the Green Party, used parliamentary privilege to claim that Mr Lambert – who went under the alias Bob Robinson – carried out the attack after infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front. Undercover: Bob Lambert - who went under the alias Bob Robinson - carried out the attack to prove his worth to the Animal Liberation Front, Caroline Lucas claimed today . The group planted the devices in protest at the store’s decision to sell fur products. The attacks caused £8million of damage and led Debenhams to stop selling fur. The claims were strongly denied by Mr . Lambert, who is now a leading academic and expert in terrorism and . Islamophobia at St Andrew’s University. Following the July 1987 attacks on . Debenhams, two activists – Geoff Sheppard and Andrew Clarke – were . jailed for planting devices in the Luton and Romford stores. Sheppard received a sentence of four . years and four months, while Clarke was jailed for more than three . years. The third activist involved was never caught. Allegation: Caroline Lucas used parliamentary privilege to reveal that a police officer was accused of planting a bomb in a Debenhams store in 1987 . Bombing: A fireman hoses down a smouldering Debenhams store in Luton, Bedfordshire, after it was targeted by animal rights activists.

She read from his statement, which . said: ‘I straightaway knew that Bob had carried out his part of the . plan. ‘There’s absolutely no doubt in my . mind whatsoever that Bob Lambert placed the incendiary device at the . Debenhams store in Harrow. ‘I specifically remember him giving an . explanation to me about how he had been able to place one of the . devices in that store, but how he had not been able to place the second . device.’ Infiltration: Bob Lambert was outed as an undercover police officer after Mark Kennedy was exposed . Miss Lucas alleged that when . Sheppard’s flat was raided two months later while he was making four . more fire-bombs, the intelligence was so accurate it ‘came from Bob . Lambert’. Calling for an inquiry into the . activities of undercover officers, Miss Lucas told MPs: ‘It would seem . that planting the third incendiary device was perhaps a move designed to . bolster Lambert’s credibility and reinforce the impression of a genuine . and dedicated activist. ‘There is no doubt in my mind that . anyone planting an incendiary device in a department store is guilty of a . very serious crime and should have charges brought against them.’ Mr Lambert said: ‘It was necessary to . create the false impression that I was a committed animal rights . extremist to gain intelligence so as to disrupt serious criminal . conspiracies. ‘However, I did not commit serious crime such as planting an incendiary device at the Debenhams Harrow store.’ Mr Lambert infiltrated the Animal Liberation Front in the late 1980s and his evidence was used to convict Sheppard and Clarke. He went on to become a police spymaster who led a network of undercover officers who infiltrated radical groups. His cover was blown when Mark Kennedy, another officer who infiltrated a group of environmental activists, was exposed in 2010. Mr Kennedy was later found to have had . sex with two activists. Mr Lambert has also admitted to carrying out . affairs while working undercover and fathered a child with one . protester.

"A T-shirt company promoting race equality released a video on Tuesday with children from Ferguson, Missouri aimed at calling attention to the racism that still exists in America today. FCKH8.com is a 'for-profit T-shirt company with an activist heart' that donates $5 out of every $13 dollars spent on T-shirts to charities working to fight racism. The Blaze reports that the T-shirt company recruited six children from Ferguson, Missouri who lived on the same block where teenager Michael Brown, 18, was shot in the face by police officers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Joining together: A T-shirt company recruited kids from Ferguson who lived on the same block as Mike Brown to join together to fight racism . Misconceptions: The video pointed out the misconceptions white people have today about the existence of racism . Things white people say: This girl mockingly pretends to be a white person who doesn't have to deal with racism . The video begins by saying that Ferguson is the place, 'where white police shot an unarmed black teen in the face.' The shooting spawned a nationwide discussion about the prevalence of racism in the modern day despite having a black president in office and supposedly living in more accepting times. In the background a kid can be heard yelling that the incident is, 'a national disgrace.' The video goes on to point out things that white people allegedly say about racism and their belief that it  no longer exists. 'But is racism still a thing?,' a a kid asks pretending as though they were ignorant. 'All this focus on race makes me uncomfortable.' 'Try being black,' pipes an adorable little boy. 'It’s you people who are making this about race,' say one kid, . 'I don’t see color,' mocked another. 'You people are just playing the race card,' said a kid pretending to be a jaded white person. 'Some of my best friends are black.' Later in the video a white man appears in the video and talks about how fighting racism is about joining together. 'Racism is not over but I’m over racism,' says the T-shirt and the message the the children are trying to send to racist America. Puts them in their place: 'Try being black' says a little boy in response to white people saying that talking about race makes them uncomfortable . 'You people': The kids point out how white people deflect the race issue by saying only black people are bringing it up .

"Scotland could be on the verge of voting for independence in the upcoming referendum on its future in the Union after a recent poll showed the gap between rival campaigns had almost closed. The dismal polling for unionists has led to senior Tories to push for Alistair Darling to be sidelined as head of the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK, amid growing concerns about his performance. Members of David Cameron's inner circle are increasingly alarmed that the lacklustre Better Together movement run by the former Labour chancellor could hand victory to the Scottish nationalists. One poll yesterday found the pro-independence Yes campaign, which once trailed by a wide margin, is now only three points behind – raising the prospect of a majority vote to break up the union in September. Members of David Cameron's inner circle are increasingly alarmed about Alistair Darling's performance as head of the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK . Senior Tories are pointing the finger at Mr Darling, who was initially seen as a safe pair of hands. They accept the campaign cannot be led by a Conservative, but believe a more charismatic Labour figure such as former home secretary John Reid should be recruited to take on SNP leader Alex Salmond. A senior Tory source said: 'Alistair Darling's true colours have come through now – he's a middlingly competent accountant with zero charisma. 'You never see him. Where is the big figure to lead the campaign and take the fight to Salmond? It's just dismal at the moment.' Senior Tories believe a more charismatic figure is needed to compete with Alex Salmond (pictured) The faltering performance of the No side of the debate is said to be causing bitter infighting in the Better Together organisation. A source said factions were 'barely talking to each other'. Better Together is also struggling to compete financially, following an intervention by EuroMillions winners Colin and Chris Weir. The couple, who won £161million in 2011, are reported to have given a total of £3million to the Yes campaign and the SNP during the past 15 months, dwarfing contributions to the No campaign. Blair Jenkins, of the pro-independence drive, said: 'The extreme negativity of the No campaign is proving a major turn-off for voters and month by month they are paying the price.'","Members of David Cameron's inner circle are increasingly alarmed .

"A Boston Market employee unwittingly ranted about his hatred of customers to a female co-worker, who ended up being a company exec working incognito on Undercover Boss. A youthful looking employee named Ronnie, at the company's outpost in Duluth, Georgia, said he hated guests who came to the restaurant, calling them selfish and demanding. The undercover executive became livid and ended up firing the man, the first time ever for someone to get the boot on the CBS reality show. Scroll down for video. Outrageous: Sara Bittorf, Chief Brand Officer of Boston Market (left), went undercover on the show and was trained by Ronnie (right) who openly complained about the restaurant's customers . Incognito: Sara Bittorf is a high level executive at Boston Market. She posed as a waitress, Rachel Rand (right), to appear on the CBS reality show, Undercover Boss . Sara Bittorf, Chief Brand Officer at Boston Market, was sent on a reconnaissance mission by the company's CEO to appear on the CBS show and find out what was actually going on, in the episode that aired on February 1. Ms Bittorf posed as a waitress, Rachel Rand, who joined the Boston Market staff - saying she was appearing on a reality show to win a chance to open her own diner. But she had no idea what was in store for her when she showed up as a trainee at a Boston Market in Duluth, Georgia. She underwent training and learned the tricks of the trade but was appalled when her shift supervisor, Ronnie, spent much of his time mouthing off about the people being served. 'I literally hate customers more than anything in the entire world. I hate them so much,' he told Bittorf, knowing full well his words were being captured on camera for the so-called reality show. 'They're terrible. It's all about them all the time and they demand everything,' he continued, adding his disdain at having to 'suffer through' the day serving customers. Oops: Ronnie was surprised to learn the girl in the kitchen was actually a big shot at Boston Market . Defensive: Ronnie didn't see what the big deal was about his comments, saying 'It's not wrong of me to hate people' The secret exec excused herself from the kitchen to catch her breath because she became so incensed by Ronnie's comments. 'My job's on the line. Here I am a representative of this brand and this is what happens. It can't happen on my watch,' she said as she tried to cool off in the parking lot. 'I can't have someone who just told me that they hate customers more than anything in the world serving our guests. That's the complete antithesis of what we stand for.' After collecting her thoughts, Bittorf decided the truth must be told. She revealed her true identity to Ronnie and scolded him for his behavior. 'Without the guests in there, we don't have a business and you don't have a paycheck,' she informed him, sending him home for the day as his future hung in the balance. Ronnie was shocked to learn the kitchen help was actually a bigwig at the company but even so, he failed to show remorse at his prior comments. 'I would tell them my attitude would change but I didn't think it was that terrible,' he said, out of earshot of Bittorf after the big reveal. Shocked: The undercover exec was appalled that a shift supervisor openly shared how much he hated customers . 'It's not wrong of me to hate people,' he said. 'They don't know I'm saying it so it's not that big a deal but now this giant lady of Boston Market knows what's going on, that's just not fair,' he said before he got into his car and drove home for the day. After Ronnie got a dressing down from Bittorf, she revealed her true identity to the branch manager and advised that Ronnie be fired. The manager agreed and Ronnie was shown the door, a first for the CBS program that has been on the air since February 2010.","Sara Bittorf, Chief Brand Officer at Boston Market, went on Undercover Boss at the behest of the company's CEO .

"Employers are being urged to watch their staff for signs of domestic violence - with indicators including shifts in behaviour and changes in clothing to hide bruises. Public Health England (PHE) issued the warning and stressed that managers have a duty to spot people who are being abused and take steps to offer them support. The PHE guidance is part of its campaign, 16 Days Of Action, which is running from November 25 to December 10, to highlight the responsibilities that employers have to protect their workers. Scroll down for video . New campaign: Employers are being urged to watch their staff for signs of domestic violence by PHE . The campaign, which comes with an advisory 'violence toolkit for businesses' states: 'Women often experience repeated abuse for longer than men before reaching out for help. 'This means you may well be involved in managing someone who has experienced or is experiencing domestic abuse, as well as those who are perpetrators of abuse.' Research says 25 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men fall victim to some form of domestic abuse during their lives. As well as physical violence - this can also be verbal, emotional and financial abuse. More than half of those affected by domestic abuse are absent from work at least three days a month - and 56 per cent of abused women arrive late for work at least five times per month. A staggering two per cent of employees in the UK actually lose their jobs as a direct result of domestic violence and 75 per cent of victims are targeted at work. This often includes harassing phone calls, text messages and emails - with abusive partners often turning up at the workplace. PHE's guidance tells companies to record any incidents that take place at work and ensure that staff do not have to work alone or in isolated areas. They are being encouraged to put up posters to highlight the support available for staff who disclose difficulties in their personal life. Signs: Public Health England say managers should look out for shifts in behaviour or a change in attire that may be designed to hide bruising . And employers are also advised to divert phone calls and emails from suspected abusive partners and offer employees a new phone extension number if required. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said: 'It is unacceptable that in England and Wales, two women a week die as a result of domestic violence, and many more suffer physical and mental harm. 'Workplaces are a safe space for many people living in violence and are key for providing opportunities for disclosure and support into safety. 'As it stands, companies can do more to support their employees who experience domestic abuse, train those who witness, and protect staff as a whole.' Mr Fenton believes companies which take steps to tackle the issue will actually benefit financially as there would be fewer unexplained absences and less staff turnover caused by violence at home. He adds: 'Signing up to the pledge and using the toolkit not only means businesses are supporting their staff and securing safety in the workplace, but they will also save on financial loss due to absence and turnover. 'It is a win win for businesses and we urge them to utilise this resource.' Speaking to The Independent he added: 'Bringing discussions of domestic violence into the workplace is a crucial step in providing routes to safety for people enduring violence.' Companies are being urged to sign the 16 Days of Action pledge and join 'the global fight against domestic violence'. The NHS is one of the first organisations to train its staff in dealing with the issue. Sue Covill, director of employment services at NHS Employers, claimed guidance was crucial as most managers would not be confident enough to intervene. She said: 'It's not about the workplace intruding into personal matters but helping to ensure the workplace doesn't get in the way and can even speed up the process of recovery.' Companies can sign the 16 Days Of Action pledge by visiting the campaign's website.","Public Health England issued guidance for 16 Days of Action campaign .

"Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius's chances of winning bail appeared to increase dramatically today after an embarrassing series of blunders and confusion in the prosecution case. Just hours after the police officer leading the murder hunt told the athlete's bail hearing in Pretoria that the performance enhancing drug testosterone and steroids had been found at his mansion home shortly after the killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, prosecutors changed their story. In a humiliating U-turn, a spokesman for South Africa's National Prosecution Agency said there had been an error in the evidence of detective Warrant Officer Hilton Botha when he identified the substance found in the 26 year-old's bedroom. Scroll down for video . Boxes of 'testosterone' and needles were found at Oscar Pistorius' home where he shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead after 'non-stop' arguing, a court heard today . Investigating officer Hilton Botha had to correct himself in court after initially saying steroids were found at the home of Oscar Pistorius. He then said it was testosterone but prosecution later admitted the drugs have not yet been tested . Medupe Simasiku said it is too early . to identify the substance as it is still undergoing laboratory tests. In fact, no results of any forensic tests from the scene of the killing . had been given to investigators. There had been gasps in court when WO . Botha, a policeman for 24 years and the first officer to arrive at the . Pistorius house on Valentine's Day following the shooting of the 29 . year-old model and law graduate, and prosecutors claimed testosterone . had been found together with needles. Discovery of the sports drug could . potentially have brought questions over the star's achievements at . London 2012 where he became the first athlete to compete at an Olympics . and Paralympics, winning two gold medals and a silver. At one stage, the detective supposedly . providing the key facts to keep Pistorius in custody had agreed with . the defence lawyer that police had no evidence challenging the runner's . claim he accidently killed his girlfriend in a bathroom, believing it . was an intruder. Police accuse Africa's most famous sportsman of premeditated murder, a charge he emphatically denies. Damning: The first half of the hearing saw damning allegations surface, but after a recess his defence team fired tough questions at the main witness, chief investigative officer Hilton Botha . WO Botha left prosecutors rubbing . their temples, only able to look down at their notes as he misjudged . distances and acknowledged a bungling forensics team left in the . bathroom toilet bowl one of the bullets fired at Miss Steenkamp. The second day of the bail hearing in a . case that has riveted South Africa and much of the world appeared at . first to go against the double-amputee runner, with prosecutors saying a . witness can testify to hearing 'non-stop talking, like shouting' between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. before the predawn shooting on February 14. However, WO Botha later said under cross examination that the person who . overheard the argument was in a house 600 metres away in Pistorius's . gated community in the suburbs of South Africa's capital, Pretoria. Later, prosecutor Gerrie Nel . questioned the detective and acknowledged the distance was much closer. But confusion reigned for much of his testimony when at one point WO . Botha said officers found syringes and steroids in Pistorius' bedroom. Mr Nel quickly cut the officer off and said the drugs were actually testosterone. Defence lawyer, Barry Roux, asserted . when questioning the detective that it was not a banned substance and . that police were trying to give the discovery a 'negative connotation.' 'It is an herbal remedy,' Mr Roux said. 'It is not a steroid and it is . not a banned substance.' WO Botha had claimed examination of the model's . body and the bathroom door Pistorius fired through suggested he had . been had been wearing his prosthetic legs - directly contradicting the . athlete's claims that he was on his stumps and fired believing an . intruder had broken in. 'I believe that he knew that Reeva was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door,' the detective told the court. Pistorius broke down in tears during the second day of the bail hearing as Mr Botha outlined the forensic evidence . Detective Hilton Botha said he believed the bullets were fired down suggesting Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were discharged . As details were released from Miss . Steenkamp's post mortem showing bullets hit the right side of her head, . her hip and right elbow - resulting in a broken arm, Pistorius lent . forward sobbing and muttered prayers, the muscles straining on his neck. In apparently damning evidence aimed . at countering the athlete's case for bail, WO Botha said he viewed the . man who won two gold medals and a silver at London 2012 as a 'flight . risk' pointing out he had not used any of the four telephones found at . the house to call police and claiming his family had been searching for a . memory stick containing details of off-shore bank accounts. But amid confusion, Mr Roux began to . pick holes in the prosecution case with the officer forced to . acknowledge that the witness who allegedly overheard the argument was . 600 metres from Pistorius' house at the Silver Woods complex on the . outskirts of Pretoria. He later changed this to 300 metres. Police 'take every piece of evidence . and try to extract the most possibly negative connotation and present it . to the court,' Mr Roux told magistrate Desmond Nair. Pistorius's brother Carl said after the hearing that he 'trusts everyone has more clarity about this tragic incident' There was even laughter in the court . during an exchange between Mr Nair and WO Botha with the magistrate . asking the officer about his belief that if granted bail, Pistorius . would flee South Africa. Addressing WO Botha and prosecutor . Gerrie Nel, Mr Nair said: 'The accused before court is an international . athlete, paralympic athlete, he uses prosthesis on both legs. 'I'm sure . we would both agree that his face is widely recognised internationally. Do you subjectively believe that he would take the opportunity, being . who he is, using prosthesics to get around, to flee South Africa?' WO . Botha responded: 'Yes.' Security in the court stopped the laughter in . the court. The magistrate raises his eyebrows. WO Botha protested: 'I believe for . someone facing 15 years to life, I would make a plan to get out and go . somewhere, with the finances he has.' Bathroom plan: A projector was used to beam the plans up for the public and press to see . Mr Nair said: 'And if he were to . flee, he may opt for a country with no extradition agreement with South . Africa?' 'It's possible,' the officer replied. Mr Nair pressed him: 'But do you think . it's possible that a person who has won Olympic golds would want to . forsake his career when he has a chance to prove his innocence in a . court of law?' 'Your honour, imprisonment is no joke,' the officer said. The exchanges appeared to lift the . spirits and hopes of the Pistorius family sitting in court that the bail . application might be successful, their dark mood during the initial . stages of prosecution evidence changing to one of relief and smiles as . they left court. Earlier, Mr Nel said the killing was premeditated because Pistorius took time to put on his prosthetic legs before the shooting. Scene of horror: This is the toilet cubicle where Reeva Steenkamp was found 'slumped over but alive' after being shot three times through the locked door . He projected a plan of the bedroom and . bathroom for the courtroom and argued Pistorius had to walk past his . bed to get to the bathroom and could not have done so without realizing . the Miss Steenkamp was not in the bed as he claimed. 'There's no other way of getting there,' Mr Nel said. WO Botha said the holster for the 9mm . pistol was found under the side of the bed on which Steenkamp slept - . also implying it would have been impossible for Pistorius to get the gun . without realizing that Miss Steenkamp was not in the bed and could have . been the person in the bathroom WO Botha said he wanted Pistorius . charged additionally with a weapons violation after unlicensed .38 . calibre ammunition was found at the house. Mr Roux asked the officer if Miss . Steenkamp's body - she was wearing white shorts and a black vest - . showed 'any pattern of defensive wounds,' and the detective said it did . not. WO Botha said the shots were fired . from five feet, and that police found three spent cartridges in the . bathroom and one in the hallway connecting the bathroom to the bedroom. He admitted police had initially missed finding one cartridge. The hearing at Pretoria Magistrates' Court is due to resume at 11am local time tomorrow morning - it was initially expected to last for two days . Police also found two iPhones in the . bathroom and two BlackBerrys in the bedroom, he said, adding that none . had been used to phone for help. Pistorius had said that he called the . manager of his guarded and gated housing complex and a private paramedic . service. Mr Roux countered Pistorius did make . calls, including to the guards of the housing estate. In one case, he . said, a guard could hear Pistorius crying. 'Was it part of his premeditated plan, not to switch off the phone and cry?' Mr Roux asked sarcastically. Screaming heard coming from the house was Pistorius calling for help from his balcony, not Miss Steenkamp, the lawyer said. Leaving court , the athlete's brother . Carl Pistorius said : 'I feel like the court proceedings went well. We . trust that everyone has more clarity about this tragic incident.'

"It is a mystery that has gone unsolved for more than 140 years since Charles Darwin noticed something peculiar about domesticated mammals. But now scientists think they know why domestic species tend to have certain characteristics that accompany their tameness, such as floppier ears, patches of white fur, and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws. Geneticists believe that a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest, link all these traits, which are seen in many people’s pet cats and dogs. Domestic science: Scientists think they know why domestic species tend to have certain characteristics that accompany their tameness, such as floppier ears, patches of white fur, and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws (illustrated by this spaniel) - and it's because of a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest . Although the experts' proposal has not yet been tested, it is the first hypothesis that connects several components of the ‘domestication syndrome.’ It not only applies to mammals like dogs, foxes, pigs, horses, sheep and rabbits, but it may even explain similar changes in domesticated birds and fish, according to the study published in the journal Genetics. ‘Because Darwin made his observations just as the science of genetics was beginning, the domestication syndrome is one of the oldest problems in the field. So it was tremendously exciting when we realised that the neural crest hypothesis neatly ties together this hodgepodge of traits,’ said Adam Wilkins, from the Humboldt University of Berlin, who is one of the paper’s authors. Neural crest cells are formed near the developing spinal cord of early vertebrate embryos. As the embryo matures, the cells migrate to different parts of the body and give rise to many tissue types. Charles Darwin (pictured left) noticed tame mammals share certain characteristics and scientists have struggled to understand why they share certain characteristics ever since. Wild dogs and wolves, (pictured right) which evolved from a common ancestor of the modern dog, tend to have large jaws and erect ears . These tissues include pigment cells and parts of the skull, jaws, teeth and ears, as well as the adrenal glands, which are the centre of the ‘fight-or-flight’ response. Neural crest cells also indirectly affect brain development. In the hypothesis proposed by Dr Wilkins and scientists at Harvard University and the University of Vienna, domesticated mammals may show impaired development or migration of neural crest cells compared to their wild ancestors. ‘When humans bred these animals for tameness, they may have inadvertently selected those with mild neural crest deficits, resulting in smaller or slow-maturing adrenal glands. So, these animals were less fearful,’ he explained.

Scientists now think that these cells link traits seen in domesticated animals, such as floppier ears, patches of white fur and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws. The neural . crest influences more than adrenal glands. Among other effects, neural . crest deficits can cause white patches of skin and fur, floppy ears, . tooth anomalies, and jaw development changes, all of which are seen in . the domestication syndrome. The . authors also suggest that the reduced forebrain size of most domestic . mammals could be an indirect effect of neural crest changes, because a . chemical signal sent by these cells is critical for proper brain . development. ‘This interesting idea based in developmental biology brings us closer to solving a riddle that's been with us a long time. It provides a unifying hypothesis to test and brings valuable insight into the biology of domestication,’ said Mark Johnston, editor-in-chief of the journal. Tests of the neural crest hypothesis may not be far off, as other scientists are rapidly mapping the genes that have been altered by domestication in the rat, fox, and dog. The hypothesis predicts that some of these genes will influence neural crest cell biology. If so, experts will have a much deeper understanding of the biology underlying a significant evolutionary event, Dr Wilkins explained. ‘Animal domestication was a crucial step in the development of human civilisations. Without these animals, it's hard to imagine that human societies would have thrived in the way they have,’ he added.","A study led by Humboldt University of Berlin claims that a a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest, link traits in tame animals .

Amy Brown, 21, suffered cruel taunts during her school years because she achieved good grades and wore boy's clothes. Amy, from the Forest of Dean, learned to cope with her tormentors after taking up rugby when she was 12 and played at least twice a week for her local club. Scroll down for video . Amy Brown suffered years of bullying but now the rugby star has been crowned a beauty queen . Amy was crowned Miss Forest of Dean earlier this year after friends suggest she enter . Last month her friends suggested she enter a local beauty pageant and two weeks ago she was crowned Miss Forest of Dean. Amy, who stands 5ft 8ins tall, will swap her muddy boots for high heels when she competes in the semi-finals of Miss England in June. Amy, who is studying Criminology at the University of Gloucester, says she never imagined that she would take so well to pageanting. Amy began playing rugby when she was 12-years-old . 'I never expected to come this far. I've never been into high heels and dresses. 'For me, it was always rugby and drinking with the lads in the bar afterwards. The closest I ever had to having a picture taken was doing a selfie.' Amy says that after years of being told how unattractive she was she never thought she would go on to win a contest. Before winning Miss Forest of Dean, Amy had never entered a beauty pageant before . 'I never ever thought of myself as being particularly glam. Before I got into rugby I was bullied at school. 'I wasn't very popular and worked hard so the bullies called me ""boffin"" and ""ugly"". Even in my teens I didn't wear makeup and played rugby to deal with the name calling.' Amy says that rugby helped to act as a release for all of her pent up anger towards her bullies. 'It was a way I could get my frustration out but I really enjoy it. I'm in the second row so I'm in the thick of the action. 'I always get stuck in and I've got knocked out twice. I haven't got any cauliflower ears thankfully.' Amy, who has a long-term boyfriend, gym instructor Ben Jones, 22, has beaten thousands of hopefuls to reach the semi-finals of Miss England. Before winning Amy had no experience in beauty contests but says that she loves getting dolled up now. 'I never thought I'd make it to the semi-finals of Miss England. It's been an amazing journey. 'Before the competition I'd never been on a catwalk. The first time I put on high heels I tottered about and almost lost my balance so I've had to practice loads. 'It's a great feeling to get glammed up now, especially when I think back to the abuse I got from the bullies. I do feel like I've had the last laugh.' Amy says that playing rugby was a way of releasing all of her pent up frustration towards her bullies .","Amy Brown began playing rugby after being bullied about her looks .

"The storming of the BP gas plant in Algeria and murder of dozens of hostages was orchestrated by a Canadian, it emerged yesterday. Documents found on the bodies of two terrorists – one a ringleader – identified them as Canadians and Western intelligence agencies were checking last night whether either was ‘known’ to them. Survivors have told how at least one of the kidnappers spoke perfect English in giving them orders. Both Canadians entered Algeria from Libya with members of the ‘Blood Battalion’ led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar. Scroll down for video . One-eyed fugitive: Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian who fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of up to 41 foreigners at an Algerian gas field . Armed to the teeth: The terrorists' weapons, recovered by Algerian special forces, included six machine guns, 21 rifles, two mortars with shells, two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and ten explosive belts . Their cars were painted in the colours of the Algerian state energy firm, Sonatrach. Only part of one of the men’s names – . ‘Chedad,’ which is Moroccan – was released yesterday but British . investigators were seeking to establish whether either Canadian had . spent time in Britain or had UK links. The development raises fears that the . Arab Spring has been a rallying call for extremists. Hundreds of . Britons and Westerners joined the fighting in the Middle East and North . Africa and some may have subsequently joined violent groups abroad or . terror gangs back home. Significantly, a Briton who is . believed to be an Islamic convert in his late 20s with blond hair and . blue eyes is said to have joined one-eyed Belmokhtar’s group last year. He is reported to have visited wounded jihadists at a hospital in . south-east Mali. Terrifying: This image shows the moment that workers were first taken captive by Al Qaeda terrorists at the remote plant in Algeria . Destroyed: Men look at the wreckage of a vehicle near In Amenas. Algerian bomb squads scouring the gas plant found numerous new bodies as they searched for explosive traps left behind . And a second British jihadist linked . to the terror leader is said to be a Londoner, who was captured by the . Mauritanian authorities last month trying to cross into Mali. The BBC was criticised yesterday for calling the gang behind the Algeria hostage killings ‘militants’ rather than ‘terrorists’. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he was disappointed that the broadcaster was ‘consistently’ using the term. The BBC has specific guidance about the  word terrorist, warning its reporters that it can imply value judgments. In one report on its website, it described the killers as ‘militants’ 12 times. The word ‘terrorist’ appeared only in a quote. Mr Bridgen quizzed David Cameron on the issue yesterday and the Prime Minister agreed that he had a ‘good point’. He added: ‘These are terrorists and they should be described as such.’ Investigators say the men are part of . a ‘small but increasing and significant’ number of Britons or foreign . nationals living in the UK and travelling to join extremist groups with . loose associations to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. It is thought Britons and other Europeans may have attended terror camps in the Sahel region to the south of the Sahara. The Canadian link has long been . feared, according to David Harris of the terrorist intelligence . programme at Insignis Strategic Research in Ottawa. He said the country’s open borders . and dual language made it attractive to French-speaking immigrants from . North Africa. French anti-terrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière has . called Montreal a hub of North African terrorism. Four years ago, a Canadian, Momin . Khawaja, was jailed for ten years for his part in planning a fertiliser . bomb plot in Britain for which five people were convicted in the UK. Khawaja, 33, made numerous trips from his home in Ottawa to London claiming to be seeking a wife. He was actually helping to plan the attack, which was foiled by British police. Algeria’s prime minister yesterday . said 37 foreigners of eight nationalities and one Algerian worker were . killed during the hostage crisis. At least 29 militants also died. Abdelmalek Sellal, who strongly . defended the actions of his special forces in storming the BP plant, . said the terrorists had worn army uniforms, memorised the layout of the . vast complex and were intending to blow it up. The plant, which is vital to the Algerian economy, is expected to resume operations today. Jihadists yesterday threatened more hostage-taking unless Western powers leave Mali. Updating MPs in the House of Commons this afternoon, David Cameron said the process of bringing home the bodies of the victims was Britain's top priority, but might take some time. David Cameron, pictured outside Downing Street today, was due to update MPs on the situation in Algeria this afternoon. Mr Cameron said his deepest . condolences were with the families of the victims and told the Commons . work to clear the site of potential traps was continuing. He said: 'Now our most vital work is . bringing home those who died. An international team of British, American . and Norwegian experts is in close co-operation with the Algerian . ministry of justice undertaking the task of formally identifying their . bodies. 'We want this process to happen as . swiftly as possible but it will involve some intensive forensic and . policing work and so may take some time.' He said 800 employees were working at plant at the time of the attack, 135 of whom were foreign nationals. More than 40 of those were taken hostage and at least 12 were killed, with at least a further 20 unaccounted for and feared dead, he said. The number of terrorists was over 30, most of whom were killed during the incident, while 'a small number' had been taken into Algerian custody. He said evolving nature of the global terrorist . threat demanded a 'tough, intelligent, patient' response based on strong international partnerships. Earlier, the PM's official spokesman stressed that the Government's position that UK . troops will not take on a combat role in Mali remained unchanged. The spokesman told a regular . Westminster media briefing: 'Clearly in Mali at the moment there is a . military response in terms of French forces supporting the Malian . government. 'We very much support the French in . that but our position about troops not being in a combat role is . completely unchanged with regard to Mali. 'More widely, as the Foreign . Secretary was saying in the context of Somalia, when it comes to . military roles our view is very much that they should be . regionally-led.' Asked whether Mr Cameron was content . with Algiers' response to the siege, the spokesman said: 'We were always . very clear that there there were difficult decisions that faced the . Algerian authorities. It was a fluid, fast-moving event. We were not . going to rush into making judgments.' He added: 'The Prime Minister said . yesterday that we should be very clear that the responsibility for the . loss of life lies with the terrorists. 'We recognise what the Algerians have . done to co-ordinate with us. He thanked them for that and he also noted . the Algerian loss of life and the fact that this was an attack against . an Algerian site.' The spokesman said Britain would 'work with our international partners' to bring those responsible for the killings to justice. Asked about claims made during the . siege by the hostage-takers' leader, Abdul Rahman al-Nigeri, that he had . been in contact with British officials, Mr Cameron's spokesman said: . 'We don't negotiate with terrorists. 'That has always been and remains our policy. I have seen these reports but I am not going to go into details.'

"Hollywood movie director Steven Spielberg is the talk of the internet after a photo of him posing with a 'dead' dinosaur went viral. The picture, taken on the set of his 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, was posted online last Sunday by Facebook meme-maker and wit Jay Branscomb.

"A woman has revealed how she has to hire a babysitter to look after her dolls – because she believes they are possessed by the ghosts of dead people. Katrin Reedik, 33, from Glasgow, has spent thousands of pounds on what she claims are haunted dolls and believes they are possessed and if they are left alone they will cause mischief in her home. The full-time mother-of-two says her nights are taken up with chatting to her charges about how they died. Scroll down for video . Karin Reedik has purchased 12 haunted dolls which she claims hold the spirits of dead people . The single mother to Christopher Robin, eight, and Karl, seven, says that she bought the dolls after developing a fascination with the supernatural while travelling. 'I became interested in the spirit world in 2008, while living in Estonia, Northern Europe, because I felt the presence of a spirit,' she said. 'This started my interest in the paranormal and when I moved to Glasgow in November 2008 I started researching spooky things and stumbled upon haunted dolls.' Mystical was the first doll that Karin purchases and she said that she immediately knew she was a 'person' Each of Krin's dolls has a story. Pictured: Yulia (left) was a woman who was 33 when she died in a plane crash and Trena (right) was a  witch who died in her 30s . Katrin was first intrigued when she discovered through online shops and forums there were dolls with spiritual powers. 'Haunted dolls are not possessed as such, the doll is the spirit's home. 'The spirit is attached to the doll and sometimes leaves it in the same way humans go to work every day. 'You can buy a doll, get it in the post, and the spirit comes with it.' Katrin has to hire a babysitter while she is out to prevent the dolls from causing mischief . A shop in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, sells the dolls in the UK and scores of people chat about the subject on forums. Enthralled by this new discovery, in August 2010 Katrin ordered her first doll, Mystical, from the US for just £10. Katrin says that as soon as Mystical arrived she began to notice spooky goings-on in her home. 'When she arrived I realised straight away she was not a doll, she was a person,' she said. 'That night I put her near the television I told her: ""If you're happy switch it off, if you are not happy leave it."" 'The response was terrifying. The TV switched off and on, the lights flickered and I knew it was Mystical talking to me through the electricity. 'She told me she was happy to have been adopted by me. 'I was overwhelmed and had to put her away.' But a week later, Katrin tried to 'speak' to the doll again. 'She told me, in the same process through the TV, that she had died when she was 103 and is very wise.' After coming to terms with Mystical's power, Katrin decided she wanted more dolls and has now bought 12. Karin now says that she sources her dolls from a number of different places. 'I usually get the dolls from collectors who have websites dedicated to them. 'They have purchased the dolls from people who didn't know the doll was haunted.' She says she is happy to spend a fair amount on the dolls because you are buying into their history. 'Cost depends on quality and history. You can't put a price on them, because they're so much more than dolls, they're links to another world.' Katrin has even sacrificed her basic needs in order to fund her habit. 'I am happy to go without other things to buy the dolls. I make my own clothes rather than buy new.' Katrin says that Michael (right) is the most active of her dolls and that Agatha (left) is possibly evil . Karin uses specialist ghost-hunting equipment to chat to her dolls, including voice recorders. 'I have also attempted to hear voices though my mobile phone. I put my phone on record when the dolls are in the room and listen back. 'You can hear them. They sound like humans, having conversations in the background. 'I heard a doorbell once, and I don't even have one.' Despite having devoted much of her time and money to the dolls not everyone is as keen on the collection as Karin. 'Usually my sons are not scared by the dolls, they like them and read to them. 'But they are a bit scared of my latest doll, Agatha, as her body is soft and her head heavy. 'Some relatives don't like them, they make them nervous.' Pearl (left) and Iris (right) died in their twenties and apparently love to gossip together . It was the purchase of Michael which showed Miss Reedik the dolls could 'misbehave.' 'Michael, the second doll I got in June 2011, is a baby who died from cot death in the 1980s and has since inhabited the body of a porcelain doll which I have now adopted into my care.' 'Michael is very active, he will twist his head. My mum noticed this too, and his facial expression changes. 'When Michael sees me playing with my children I often sense him crying out: ""Mummy, play with me."" But what do you expect? He is only a child. 'One day I was watching TV and the channels kept flipping to cartoons, I turned them back, but it kept flipping. 'I realised it was Michael. He is only a baby and he wanted to watch cartoons. Ashley who is said to have died more than three decades ago in a crash, regularly hides Katrin's car keys . 'I think he used his energy to do this.' It is not just Michael who plays up his 'doll mum' Karin says she has witnissed other younger dolls becoming mischevious. 'Ashley came weeks after Michael. One night Ashley revealed to me, through the use of a pendulum, that he died more than three decades ago in a car crash. 'He regularly hides my car keys, because of the accident. His mum passed over in the crash and now he doesn't want me going out in my car. 'I shout out: ""Ashley, Ashley,"" and the keys come back.' Each of Karin's dolls have a story which can affect the way the doll's behave in the house. 'Isabelle was a young girl who died of cancer, she was a bald child as a result of treatment. Touchingly, the doll's hair is also wispy. The Facebook page of Haunted Dolls, a shop in Shrewsbury, Shropshire has 8292 likes. Haunted dolls is run by a group of paranormal investigators. Dolls are not bought they are adopted. And dolls are not considered as toys by collectors. Dolls cost between £10 and £500 depending on their history. 'She is quite cheeky, she teams up with Michael to turn on taps. I have no idea how they do this. It's a real mystery. 'I then got Yulia, 33, who died in a plane crash.' Karin says that the dolls are even starting to play tricks on her children as well as her. 'Baby Blue came next in autumn 2011, he died when he was ten months old. His spirit sneaks into my sons' beds. They feel the covers go back. 'We know who it is so they are not scared.' Her next four dolls were Heather and Gretchen, both seven-years-old and Iris and Pearl, who died in their 20s. 'I know when Pearl is around, she smells of fresh washing and bread. 'They love to gossip to one another. I'm not sure what they talk about, like most young women they don't want to tell their old mum.' Kartin's last two dolls both arrived in May this year, Trena is a witch who died in her 30s and Agatha who is a portal for three spirits. But having the dolls around has not always been a smooth ride with Karin claiming that they were responsible for an accident in her home. 'There was a small fire in my flat a few weeks ago and I know it was the spirits. 'They just have so much energy, but I wouldn't be without them.' She does not like to leave the dolls alone, so her mum babysits if she has to go away over night but she tries to avoid them where possible. 'Mum refuses to go into my room, where the majority of the dolls are kept. 'She said it is too scary, and is afraid of the spirits but I couldn't leave them alone.' Karin admits that people do have a hard time believing her but she insists that she is telling the truth. 'I have had boyfriends and they don't mind them as they don't believe they are haunted. 'People think I am mad, but I have heard the dolls talk. I have adopted them like I would a child and I would not let them go.' Mystical - Died when she was 103 and is very wise. Michael - A baby who died from cot death in the 1980s. Ashley- A child who died more than three decades ago in a car crash. Isabelle - A young girl who died of cancer. Yulia - A woman who was 33 when she died in a plane crash. Baby Blue - A baby who died when he was ten months old. Heather and Gretchen - Both died when they were seven-years-old. Iris and Pearl - Died in their 20s. Trena - A witch who died in her 30s. Agatha - Possibly evil, as her kids are scared of her.","Katrin Reedik has spent thousands on the haunted dolls .

"Mrs May – famous for her daring kitten heels – chose a lifetime subscription to Vogue as her luxury item on the BBC's Desert Island Discs . She is the longest serving Home Secretary Britain has had in 50 years, and now Theresa May has revealed she is not shy of putting on her dancing shoes. The politician said that Abba track - Dancing Queen - is one of her favourite records for 'something to jump up and down to' when she appeared on Desert Island Discs this morning. She recalled donning a pair of flared trousers and a yellow blouse with 'huge voluminous sleeves', adding that 'my husband and I are sort of the Abba generation'. But one of the 58-year-old's song choices on the Radio 4 programme may have raised some eyebrows, after she demanded that women be themselves in the workplace and not try to ape the antics of their male colleagues. After telling host Kirsty Young that ‘women in politics, in business, in whatever field they’re in, should be able to do the job as themselves’, Mrs May then selected Walk Like A Man by the Four Seasons as a castaway track. The song comes from the Broadway production of the musical The Jersey Boys. The Home Secretary says: ‘My husband and I went to see The Jersey Boys a few years ago. It’s a fantastic show – Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.’ Mrs May – famous for her daring kitten heels – chose a lifetime subscription to Vogue as her luxury item. In a far-reaching interview, Mrs May, also recalls her shock at being assigned her own personal protection team when she was appointed Home Secretary in 2010, and reveals she has not driven a car since she took on the job. But the former financial consultant says she rarely loses sleep despite having one of the toughest jobs in British politics. She said: ‘Fortunately, I am somebody who can sleep quite well, although I don’t get as many hours’ sleep as I might like. You are probably talking about five or six.’ Mrs May – the most powerful woman at Westminster and tipped by many to become a future leader of the Conservative Party – talks about her daily struggle with type 1 diabetes, the condition she revealed she suffered from in an interview with The Mail on Sunday last year. She says: ‘I just get on and deal with it. I am on an insulin regime, so I am injecting four times a day.’ Mrs May declines to discuss her leadership ambitions and refuses to say how she will vote in an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. Theresa May picked 'Dancing Queen' by Abba, pictured, as one of her Desert Island Discs and says it gives her 'something to jump up and down to' But she apologises for twice failing to choose an appropriate chairman for the Home Office inquiry into how the political establishment dealt with allegations of child abuse from the 1970s and 1980s. ‘I am sorry that we’ve had two attempts to appoint a chairman and both of those have ended in the individuals feeling that they had to resign. We need to look at how we are going to vet individuals who come forward,’ she says. Mrs May’s other Desert Island choice was a recording from the 1980s sitcom Yes, Minister - specifically an extract from the episode The Compassionate Society, performed by Derek Fowlds. Called The Compassionate Society, the episode is about a new hospital which is top-heavy with managers but has no medical staff or patients. Young also pressed the home secretary about plans to lead her party but she responded: 'David Cameron is a first-class prime minister. I hope he will be doing it for a very long time.' Desert Island Discs was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 this morning but is repeated again at 9am on Friday. She chose 'Walk Like A Man' from the Broadway production of the musical The Jersey Boys. She said: ‘My husband and I went to see it a few years ago. It’s a fantastic show – Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons'","Home Secretary said Abba record was something to jump up and down to .

"Created: . 10:54 EST, 2 July 2014 . A woman dubbed the 'Angel of Woolwich' for confronting Lee Rigby's two killers has been detained under the Mental Health Act after allegedly racially abusing a shop worker. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett was praised by Prime Minister David Cameron for her actions outside Woolwich barracks in May last year. But today it emerged the 49-year-old has been detained three days after an alleged race row and released into the care of the NHS. Scroll down for video . 'Detained': Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, who comforted Lee Rigby after his brutal attack last May, has allegedly been detained under the Mental Health Act after reports that she racially abused a black Tesco pharmacist three days before . Investigation: The Tesco in Helston, Cornwall, has admitted to being aware of the alleged incident last Friday . Police are investigating claims she was escorted from a Tesco in Helston, Cornwall, after a row with a black pharmacist last Friday. It is claimed she told the man he should not be allowed in England and should be working in Nigeria. Victim: Ingrid Loyau-Kennett was praised by David Cameron for her actions when Lee Rigby was killed in May last year . Tesco is said to have handed over CCTV footage to Devon and Cornwall Police. Now reports state that on Monday she was detained under the Mental Health Act. A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'We are aware of an incident which took place at our Helston store on Friday. 'Colleagues at the store are helping the police with their inquiries.' Police have only stated that inquiries are ongoing following an allegation of verbal racial abuse at the store. No one has been arrested or spoken to. Police were called to the Bulwark Estate at around lunchtime on Monday, over concerns for the welfare of a woman - believed to be Ms  Loyau-Kennet. Officers have not confirmed that the two incidents are linked or involve Ms Loyau-Kennett. A . spokesman said only: 'Following [Monday’s] incident a 49-year-old woman . from Helston has been detained under the Mental Health Act to the Royal . Cornwall Hospital and released into the care of the NHS.' Ms . Loyau-Kennett came in for national praise last May, after being among . the first on the scene following the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in a . Woolwich street. His killers, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, have since been jailed over the killing. Half-French Ms Loyau-Kennett, who has . lived in Helston for six years and hopes to find work as a translator . for a humanitarian organisation, had been returning home after a visit . to the capital to see her children, Basil and Pawony Baradaran, when the . drama unfolded. The former cub scout and brownie leader reasoned with the men, attempting to calm the situation until police arrived. 'Angel': Ms Loyau-Kennett was praised for confronting Fusilier Rigby's killers at this moment outside Woolwich barracks in London . Ms Loyau-Kennett became a national hero and last October received a Pride of Britain award for bravery, although she was unable to be honoured at the televised ceremony due to reporting restrictions in place at the time. She was also awarded a Special Certificate of Exceptional Endeavour at the Cornish Gorsedh in Penryn last autumn. However, locally she has been in dispute with neighbours after distributing leaflets calling on them to voice opposition to a £36,000 play park scheme in Bulwark Road; it has since been built. Helston police were forced to step up patrols in the area following complaints of anti-social behaviour in Bulwark and Albion Road. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 49, became a national treasure after she intervened to help police who were called to the scene of the Lee Rigby killing in Woolwich, London, in May 2013. Her actions led to a wave of praise throughout the country. The next day, David Cameron stood outside No  10 to salute her courage, while the French government recognised Ms Loyau-Kennett's . bravery with a medal. But not everyone reacted positively to Ms Loyau-Kennett's actions. The half-French divorced mother-of-two, who was formerly a teacher, said the publicity made her a target of abuse from youngsters living on her housing estate in Helston, Cornwall. She said they had picked on her since she moved to the area, due to her French accent, but the television appearances had made things worse. In October 2013, a group of young boys began pelting her Ms Loyau-Kennett's three-bedroom house, where she lives alone, with eggs and stones. When she went outside to reprimand them, she claims police threatened to arrest her for breach of the peace. Ms Loyau-Kennett said was so traumatised by the incident that she fainted and an ambulance had to be called, she said. The cub leader and former Girl Guides leader was born and raised in France to . an English mother and a French father. She lived in New Zealand for seven . years as well as Suffolk before settling in Cornwall seven years ago. Mrs Loyau-Kennet, who is a practising Catholic, is a fervent royalist who says she has embraced her adopted home with a passion. Politically, she previously described . herself as 'naturally right-wing' and said she doesn't 'agree with the . socialist thing'. She said she was proud that the country was led by . David Cameron. She has two children - Basil and Pawony, both in their 20s - who, at the time of the killing, shared a house with friends in Plumstead, South-East London. She was travelling back from visiting her children when the incident unfolded. Her grandfather, Basil Kennett, won the Distinguished Flying Cross in the Second World War.

"Casey Kasem's body was flown from the funeral home in Tacoma, Washington to a funeral home in Montreal, Canada on July 14, two days before a judge ordered Casey's widow Jean Kasem to keep the body in Tacoma for an autopsy. But mysteriously, Casey's body never arrived. A representative for Kerri Kasem, Casey's daughter, has confirmed that her father's body is missing. MailOnline has learned that Casey's body was put on a plane by staff at the Gaffney Funeral Home in Tacoma on July 14 and shipped to Urgel Bourgie Funeral Homes in Montreal. But staff at the Canadian funeral parlor say they have no record for any arrangements for the arrival of Kasem's body under his name, his birth name Kemal Amen Kasem or his wife Jean's name. Scroll down for video . Mystery: They body of Casey Kasem has gone missing more than a month after his death, according to reports . Mystery: According to Casey's death certificate, the radio icon's body was sent from the Gaffney Funeral home in Tacoma to a funeral home in Montreal, Canada on July 14. It also lists the cause of death as pending and an address for Jean Kasem in Jerusalem, Israel . Family sources told TMZ they . believe the radio host's widow Jean, who has long battled with his . three daughters from his first marriage, has taken the body from a . funeral home in Tacoma. But MailOnline confirmed that Casey's body was shipped by the Gaffney Funeral Home on July 14 to Montreal, two days before a judge ordered her to . keep it in Tacoma so that an autopsy could be carried out, at the request of . one of Kasem's daughters, the website reported. A call to Jean Kasem's attorney has not been returned. But her address listed on Casey's death certificate is in Jerusalem, Israel. The death certificate also lists the cause of death as 'pending.' On Wednesday, Pierce County Superior Court Judge Ronald Culpepper ordered her to ensure Kasem's remains are preserved and that his body remains at the funeral home until the court decides on the autopsy petition. Kerri Kasem had said she was worried that her stepmother may prevent the autopsy by having his remains moved to Canada or cremated, according to the statement she filed in court. She said she learned from the director of the funeral home that Jean Kasem planned to have an autopsy done and that worried her because she wondered why it was needed. 'I'm concerned about the results of any autopsy Jean Kasem may have commissioned and how they might be used,' Kasem wrote. At war: Jean Kasem, center, is pictured in court with her attorneys in May. A judge has ruled that she must keep Kasem's body at the funeral home until an autopsy was conducted but it has vanished . 'Consequently, I thought it would be best to ask the Washington Court to allow me to have an autopsy conducted by a forensic pathologist of my own selection.' Kasem's death certificate says the cause of his death is still undetermined. The autopsy is key to an ongoing criminal investigation into elderly abuse. Investigators are looking into his daughter's claims that Jean took him on a week-long car ride to keep him away from his family. She believes the journey caused him to develop bed sores that contributed to his death. Kasem, the radio host of 'American Top . 40' and voice of animated television characters like Scooby-Doo's . sidekick Shaggy, died on June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, . Washington. Fight: Kerri Kasem, pictured at a premiere in Los Angeles on Tuesday, wants to bury her father in the cemetery he had requested . He had suffered . from a form of dementia, and his three adult children fought a bitter . legal battle with Jean, Kasem's second wife of 34 years, over control of . his health care in his final months. His widow has accused the DJ's children of making a desperate grab for his life insurance following his death. Mrs Kasem accused Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could be cashed in. But Kerri hit back, saying that Jean hadn't had Casey's body flown out to L.A. for burial because she was trying to deflect attention from the imminent investigation into elderly abuse.","Legendary radio host died on June 15.

"A radio DJ who ridiculed a woman with Down's syndrome on the air after she called his show by mistake has been suspended from the station where he works. Kellie Baker, 30, had been trying to call a friend but was left in tears when DJ Mo, presenter of The Mo Show, said to her 'obviously you have some sort of speech impediment', before asking 'are you from this country?' DJ Mo issued an apology and has been suspended from his post at Canton station Q92 following the exchange, which Miss Baker's outraged family has described as 'blatant bullying'. 'Wonderful person': Kellie Baker, 30, was left in floods of tears when she was mocked by a DJ after calling his radio show by mistake . Miss Baker, described by her sister as a 'wonderful' person who views the world 'without cynicism and with complete and utter hope', had been trying to call a friend but dialled the number for the radio station by accident. When she asked to speak to her friend, Kelly Ann Burkhart, DJ Mo said: '... I don't want to come across - obviously you have some sort of speech impediment.' Miss Baker said: 'Uh... no, this is . my voice', before trying to cut off the conversation, saying: 'Alright, . never mind... I'll see ya later, okay, bye.' But the presenter urged her to stay on the line, saying: ''K - say it real slowly.' Trying again to end the call, Miss Baker said: 'Never mind, never mind,' to which the mocking DJ replied: 'No, say it real slowly. I want to try to figure this out. It's a little game.' Miss Baker apologised for dialling the wrong number when the presenter asked her if she realised that she had called a radio station. When he asked her if she knew who he was, Miss Baker said she didn't, and the laughing DJ replied: 'Okay, so I can laugh at you and you won't know who to call and say you're offended. Very good.' Laughing: DJ Mo, from Radio Q92 in Ohio, asked Miss Baker whether she was 'from this country' in the exchange broadcast to listeners . Kara Ball, Miss Baker's sister, said: 'Sometimes she cuts a word or two. But still, she speaks English.' Ms Ball said in a blog post that, because her sister assumes that everybody is trustworthy and kind, the DJ's comments have hurt her especially deeply. According to a report in the New York Daily News, when the call ended, Miss Baker called her mother in tears and asked: 'Why would he make fun of me?' The suspended DJ, who has said he takes 'full responsibility' for his actions, issued an apology on air and has offered to meet Miss Baker to apologise in person. 'At the time of the call, I honestly believed it was a prank. However, that doesn't excuse what happened or what I did,' he said in an audio file released by the radio station. Miss Baker's furious family claim that the conversation would have been checked before it was broadcast and insist it should never have gone on the air. The radio station has declined to comment on whether the exchange between DJ Mo and Miss Baker was pre-recorded. Miss Baker's sister Kara Ball said: 'He knows that she dialled the wrong number. This never needed to be aired, period. The family has said it intends to use the incident as an opportunity to raise awareness of how people with disabilities are treated.","Kellie Baker, 30, accidentally dialled the number for an Ohio radio station .

"Scientists have discovered a new species of fish in waters more than six miles deep. The researchers discovered the new breed of eelpout fish while combing some of the deepest waters in the world near the Kermadec Islands, north of New Zealand. They also set new depth records for rattail fish and large deep sea cusk eels, some of the most abundant of the deep-sea species. Scientists are thrilled at the discovery of the eelpout, a species not known to science before . The waters in which the team from the . University of Aberdeen's Oceanlab are so deep that they exceed the . height of Mount Everest. The scientists launched more than 50 fishing . nets over the last 14 months to a depth 9,900 metres -  1,052 metres . deeper than the height of Mount Everest, which is 8,848 metres. Dr . Alan Jamieson, the voyage leader, said: 'It's always fantastic to . discover new species of fish and to find a new type of eelpout is a . massive success.' 'It's even . better for us because we spent most of the summer building the . equipment that was used to find these fish and so it's even more . gratifying to have success. It was this big! The scientists pose with some of the rare species of fish they found in deep waters off the coast of New Zealand . 'And . now, between this and the previous two expeditions over the last 14 . months, we have sampled from a depth range greater than Mount Everest is . high. 'We are never quite sure what we will find on these expeditions to unchartered territories. 'We . had set out to find out more about the deep sea fish communities and we . were delighted to find both new species and new depth records for fish. 'But what we found was better than we expected and we can't wait to get back out there in October for another expedition.' The new species of deep-sea cusk eel was found by scientists off New Zealand who set new records for the depth at which they were found . Because the waters the fish were found in are so deep, the fish are unable to see. Dr Jamieson said: 'While the eelpouts, rattails and large deep sea cusk eels do have optical nerves, they are practically blind. 'They wouldn't be able to see a thing if they were at a higher depth as white light from the sun is too bright. 'They're surrounded by pure darkness at depths of the sea they live in, but jellyfish and shrimps give off a very, very dim blue light which eelpouts and the like can actually see.' Dr Jamieson and colleagues from NIWA and Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa conducted dozens of ocean samples in seven days of sampling. They took more than 6,500 photographs of deep sea fish and caught about 100 in total. A new fish found in the rivers and creeks in the American deep south has been named after President Barack Obama. Two scientists from Georgia and Missouri decided to name the five new species of darter they had found after American presidents. The freshwater darter was thus dubbed the Etheostoma obama. Ecologist Steve Layman told Scientific American: 'We chose President Obama for his environmental leadership, particularly in the areas of clean energy and environmental protection, and because he is one of our first leaders to approach conservation and environmental protection from a more global vision.' The other species of darter that Mr Layman and his colleague Rick Mayden discovered were dubbed Etheostoma teddyroosevelt, Etheostoma jimmycarter, Etheostoma clinton and Etheostoma gore. The biggest scoop was finding a new species of eelpout at depths of 4,250 metres. A new depth record of 5,500m was also set for a rattail fish - a breed which have never been caught in the southwest Pacific before. Another rattail fish - in depths of between 2,000 metres and 4,500 metres - which has not been caught in New Zealand waters for more than 100 years was also discovered. And finally, large deep sea cusk eels were found at another record depth of 3500m. The scientists onboard the research vessel RV Kaharoa used landers with cameras attached that free-fall to the seafloor, as well as baited fish traps to attract the animals. NIWA principal scientist Dr Malcolm Clark said: 'The international collaboration enables New Zealand researchers to use scientific equipment we don't have, and to sample places that would otherwise be inaccessible, and hence unknown. 'The results from this deep exploration are giving us a much better understanding of biodiversity in the deep sea around New Zealand, and enable us to better assess potential risks to the ecosystem from future climate change and even human activities which may include seabed mining. 'Dr Jamieson added: 'A voyage such as this is testament to how feasible scientific research in the deep sea has become. 'It is no longer the inaccessible, out of reach, part of the world it once was. 'The technological challenges of the past are being overcome, and shouldn't limit our responsibility to learn about and understand the deep sea to help ensure the long term health of the deep oceans - one of the largest environments on Earth.' The new specimens are being held at the National Fish Collection at the Museum of New Zealand. The scientists also found a rare species of rattail fish, the first time it had been found in the south Pacific . The cosmpolitan rattail was first caught off New Zealand by the HMS Challenger in a global scientific expedition in the 1870s .","New species of fish are blind .

"Men and women have different tastes in art because of biological diversity that was forged in the Stone Age, according to a leading academic. And the fact early men and women took on the different roles of hunters and gatherers may explain why just one painting in 200 at the National Gallery is by a woman, says Professor Gloria Moss. In her new book Why Men Like Straight Lines And Women Like Polka Dots*, Prof Moss argues that these ancient biological differences mean that men have better rotational and spacial vision because they were responsible for spotting and targeting prey. Prof Moss said only one painting at the National Gallery, pictured, is by a woman as collections are generally chosen by men and each gender tends to like works by their respective sex due to biological differences . ‘Some people will be squirming at the suggestion of hunter and gatherer fine-art skills,’ she says. ‘But the way men and women actually see is radically different, thanks to their roles in the hunter gatherer age. On average, men’s eyes are spaced 5mm further apart than women’s. ‘Men have better stereoscopic vision, better targeting and rotational skills and can see better in 3D. But at the same time, men are more likely to be colour blind than women. Men have three colour pigments, which means they can see millions of colours. But a substantial number of women have four colour pigments, which means they can see a much greater range.’ For this reason, Prof Moss believes men and women prefer paintings created by their own sex, explaining why great art collections – historically run by men – have only a handful of works by women. Men prefer works that have darker and fewer colours and are more likely to be drawn to works about inanimate objects, she says. By contrast, women prefer more colourful paintings, likely to be about animate things like people and plants. Prof Moss said that men like darker paintings with fewer colours about inanimate objects, while women choose artworks featuring people or plants as they are able to see a greater range of colours .","Prof Gloria Moss claims that men and women see things differently .

A simple Google search of the name and ‘energy drink’ brings up a review of the beverage, including a picture and its ingredients . The disclosure is particularly embarrassing for the hit show – which is meant to find a business partner for Lord Sugar – as it raises potential trademark issues and appears to highlight a lack of proper checks by production staff. During last week’s episode, the two teams were asked to come up with and market a new energy drink. The task, which saw three of each of the show’s teams travel to New York to pitch to experts, was won by Team Summit, with Hill, 27, singled out for his efforts.

"A catastrophic Vodafone technical fault shut down a raft of key phone services including police and NHS hotlines - and even RAC breakdown recovery, Barclays bank and First Great Western. Problems were first reported at about 9am this morning when callers were unable to reach the police non-emergency 101 number and NHS 24's medical advice line. But customers stranded at the roadside were also unable to get through to RAC and those with queries about trains were also stuck when trying to get through on the phone. A major technical fault by phone operator Vodafone left people unable to contact police and NHS hotlines . Engineers spent hours working to resolve the issue and initially anticipated that it could take several hours to fix but worked on it as a 'matter of priority' and most lines were up and running by 1pm. A spokesperson from Vodafone said: 'We can confirm that this morning an issue with one of our fixed line call routing systems temporarily affected the services we provide to a number of organisations. 'However, our engineers have worked hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and services have now been restored. 'We will continue to monitor the service closely and will be carrying out a full investigation into the issue. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.' Anglian Water, which was also affected, tweeted that the issue was at a Birmingham exchange and had been causing intermittent faults. Staff at RAC Breakdown advised people to email them their details and brief location and also said they would drive around to see if anyone was stranded. Humberside Police tweeted earlier this morning to inform members of the public that the number was down . Metropolitan Police also advised people to visit a local station or use the online form to report crime . They tweeted: 'Patrols are driving the busiest routes in their areas to look out for anyone broken down to see if we can help.' The recovery firm added: 'Vodafone suffered a catastrophic failure to its telephone equipment this am which is affecting many large businesses who use their services.' While Barclays bank also posted on Twitter that their customers were experience issues on the phone lines due to the Vodafone outage. The problem affected at least 23 police forces and people were advised that the 999 system had not been affected - but should only be used in the case of an emergency. Humberside Police tweeted: 'We can confirm that 101 is not working nationally. Fault lies with some kit in Birmingham which is being worked on.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We are working with our service provider to rectify this issue as soon as possible.' RAC Breakdown customers were also affected by the outage after lines went down and they were unable to contact the company if they were stranded by the roadside. It asked drivers to email in instead . Several affected forces offered alternative numbers or directed people to their websites or local police stations. A spokesman for Dorset Police said: 'Until the problem is fixed members of the public should use 01202/ 01305 222222 for non-emergency calls.' Hertfordshire Police offered the following numbers for reporting non-emergencies: 01707 354000 if in Hertfordshire, 01234 841212 for those in Bedfordshire and 01480 456111 for people in Cambridgeshire. Suffolk police said in a statement: 'Whilst this issue is being resolved, members of the public who need to contact Suffolk Police with non-urgent matters should dial 01473 613500. '999 should continue to be used in the event of an emergency.' North Yorkshire Police tweeted: 'There is a national issue with our non-emergency 101 line and unfortunately it is off service until further notice. 999 is still fine.' The Metropolitan Police said non-emergency crime could be reported online at www.met.police.uk . While NHS officials said some callers were also experiencing problems and were unable to get through to new medical advice line via the 111 number. Those seeking medical advice were advised to call an alternative number while engineers work to resolve issue . Members of the public were offered alternative numbers or advised if their condition was life-threatening they should call 999. NHS England tweeted at about 12.45pm: 'NHS 111 is now working normally a previous technical issue has been resolved the public should use the service as normal.' The new freephone 111 number was launched in Scotland in April. At the time, ministers said the change made the number easy to remember, while the introduction of the free-to-call service removed any barrier to the public accessing the health advice out of hours.","The issue affected calls nationally as engineers attempted to fix problems .

'While the majority of school leavers are well behaved and are enjoying the festival, I want to warn the public to be aware if you decide to take illicit drugs, you are putting your life at risk,' Hills Fleurieu police superintendent Rob Williams said. The news comes just weeks after the funeral of Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter, who died of a suspected drug overdose after taking 'one and a half' pills at Harbourlife music festival earlier this month. No arrests or injuries were reported overnight on Friday but authorities are bracing themselves for an eventful Saturday night . Police have already arrested nine people at schoolies festivities in South Australia . Her family believe it was due to an acute allergic reaction from the drugs. It's believed she overdosed on the drug known as purple speaker. The tablets had a logo in the shape of a loudspeaker and resemble other Ecstasy tablets manufactured in the Netherlands and on the market two years ago. Major Events Group Sen-Sgt Ben Nielsen issued a blunt warning about the party drugs after the death of 19-year-old Georgina Bartter, who attended music festival Harbourlife in Sydney over the weekend. 'It's not the time to experiment and the tragedy that happened in Sydney on the weekend highlights that,' Sen-Sgt Nielsen told the Herald Sun. 'You just do not know what this stuff is made up with – there is no purity to it, there is no consistency to it.' Police say a type of Ecstasy or MDMA tablet known as a 'purple speaker' may have been responsible for Georgina Bartter's death .","Schoolies week has kicked off on the Gold Coast .

"Former Kings Cross stripper and police trainee Kim Hollingsworth, who was this week found guilty of animal neglect, says she is the victim of a vicious Facebook hate campaign that has forced her to go into hiding under an assumed name. Ms Hollingsworth told Daily Mail Australia she has vengeful enemies who wrongly accused her of cruelty to animals. On Wednesday, a magistrate ordered Ms Hollingsworth pay more than $100,000 in costs after convicting her of charges including starving horses on properties at Brownlow Hill and Mulgoa, west of Sydney, late last year. Scroll down for video . Former policewoman and Kings Cross stripper Kim Hollingsworth has been ordered to pay more than $100,000 in vet costs after she was convicted of starving her horses . Ms Hollingsworth was dismissed as a NSW Police trainee in 1995 after failing to reveal her past as a stripper in Sydney's notorious Kings Cross . The one-time police trainee, whose earlier short careers as a Kings Cross stripper  were portrayed in the television series Underbelly: The Golden Mile, maintained she had done nothing wrong and would appeal against the convictions. She says she is the victim of a Facebook-led hate campaign which at one stage had more than 3000 followers and which has caused her to fear for her life. 'I'm now hiding under an assumed name somewhere in Sydney,' she said. Ms Hollingsworth said she had never been cruel to animals and pictures showing emaciated horses in her care did not prove she had neglected animals. 'Any horse I save comes in looking like s....,' she said. The 48-year-old faced 14 charges of animal neglect against four horses at properties at Brownlow Hill and Mulgoa in Sydney in late 2013 . Ms Hollingsworth, who was portrayed in the popular television series Underbelly: The Golden Mile, was forced to surrender five horses to the RSPCA . The 48-year-old said one of the horses she was convicted of failing to properly feed, a bay gelding called Ghrib, was 29 years old, was missing teeth, and 'came to me in the most emaciated condition I'd ever seen in my life'. Ms Hollingsworth was forced to surrender five horses to the RSPCA and ordered to pay $67,609 for vet costs and $46,768 for professional costs at Penrith Local Court. The charges included failing to provide proper and sufficient food and failure to provide veterinary treatment to four horses in three separate matters. Ms Hollingsworth pleaded not guilty. 'In one month I had the vet out to six different horses,' she said. 'So it's not like I was trying to avoid vet bills.' RSPCA inspectors responded to a complaint regarding horses at a Brownlow Hill property, in Sydney's south-west, in August 2013. They found a grey pony mare in an emaciated body condition and Ms Hollingsworth was issued with written directions to have the horse seen to by a veterinarian. That pony, Sadie, was aged about 35, Ms Hollingsworth said, and she had been looking after her for six to eight weeks. Sadie had an undetected eye condition and no teeth. 'She would just stand there and not eat,' she said. 'Obviously (the short time) in my hands it was not enough for her to gain significant weight.' 'I did my best with her. As far as I was concerned, I was following the vet's instructions.' A month later, she was issued further directions to provide veterinary treatment and proper and sufficient food to Sadie and Ghrib. She was ordered to pay $67,609 for vet costs and $46,768 for professional costs at Penrith Local Court . The charges she faced included failing to provide proper and sufficient food and failure to provide veterinary treatment to four horses in three separate matters . However, Ms Hollingsworth said Ghrib was missing teeth, had been 'very problematic' and fluctuated widely in weight. 'There's a million reasons why a horse doesn't gain weight,' she said. On October 31, the RSPCA were called again to the property where they claimed Sadie was in need of urgent treatment. Sadie and Ghrib were taken into care after being found to have dental issues. Sadie is the horse Ms Hollingsworth said has no teeth. On November 5, the RSPCA was called to a Mulgoa property, near Penrith in Sydney's west, in a separate matter after concerns were raised over the emaciated condition of a brumby mare. The animal was seized and was found to have lice and worms. Ms Hollingsworth said that horse had been resistant to worming and lice treatment had not worked. At the time, bushfires in the area had sometimes prevented her from visiting the animals every day. 'I drove through flames to get to those horses,' she said. Later in November, RSPCA inspectors were called to the Mulgoa property again to look at a chestnut brumby mare and foal. RSPCA inspectors were called to a Brownlow Hill property, in Sydney's south-west, in August 2013 where they found this grey mare pony in an emaciated body condition . 'I paid the vet to come and see her and followed his expert advice to just keep feeding her,' Ms Hollingsworth said. 'She was actually over fed.' The mare was in an emaciated condition, the court heard. Both horses were seized and a vet determined the mare was suffering from lice and worms. Ms Hollingsworth said: 'Lice can be very hard to get rid of. Horses can reinfect each other.' Ms Hollingsworth said it was difficult to maintain weight on brumbies. 'Brumbies have this way of just plummeting very quickly,' she said. This is the second time Ms Hollingsworth has been convicted of offences under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act for similar charges. She has also beaten another set of charges, will appeal against this week's decision and has one more set of charges to defend in court next month. 'Every case I lose will go to the Supreme Court because I've got nothing to lose,' she said. 'It's not the money. It's all about the horses' lives. They would all be dead if it were not for me.' Ms Hollingsworth told Daily Mail Australia she had been the subject of a Facebook hate campaign. Two of the women she alleges to be campaigning against her have taken out apprehended violence orders against Ms Hollingsworth. She, in turn, is applying for orders against them. 'They're just jealous,' she said. 'I was saving horse after horse. I've never said no to a horse in my life. I think I just got too big for my boots in their eyes. I was saving too many horses.' Horses in Ms Hillingsworth's care were also found to have lice and worms on various occassions . Penrith Local Court awarded custody of the horses to the RSPCA this week . This is the second time Ms Hollingsworth has been convicted of offences under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act for similar charges . Ms Hollingsworth was dismissed as a NSW Police trainee in 1995 after failing to reveal her past as a prostitute and stripper in Sydney's notorious Kings Cross. Her story became part of the TV series based on John Ibrahim in Underbelly: The Golden Mile. She was recruited as an undercover detective to act as an informant for the Wood royal commission into police corruption in the lates 1980s and early 1990s. Those experiences led her to being diagnosed with post traumatic stress syndrome. Ms Hollingsworth said it was only due to what she had been through during those years that she had not thrown herself under a train. 'This has traumatised me more than the police force thing,' she said.

"David Cameron's attempt to recover from his defeat to Ukip in the Rochester by-election was hit last night by a Downing Street row over whether Britain is ‘full’ of immigrants. An ‘immigration summit’ led to an angry clash between the PM’s allies and rebels demanding a tougher response to Nigel Farage. Former Cabinet Minister Peter Lilley is said to have claimed the UK must shut the door to EU migrants, arguing: ‘Britain is full.’ Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured, has attempted to put the defeat in the Rochester by-election behind him . He was backed by senior MPs on the Number 10 policy board, but branded ‘shrill’ by one of the PM’s aides. Jo Johnson, brother of Boris and head of the policy unit working on the party’s Election manifesto, also challenged his claim. And pro-Cameron MP Margot James praised ‘hard-working Poles and Bulgarians’, arguing the Tories ‘must not dance to Ukip’s tune’. The details have emerged as the Prime Minister faces criticism from two leading MPs in the wake of Thursday’s defeat at the hands of Ukip defector Mark Reckless. Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the Tory 1922 Committee, calls on Mr Cameron in today’s Mail on Sunday to kick out renegade MPs who have flirted with Ukip. And former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis says he must close ‘the yawning gap between Britain’s political leadership and the people they serve’ or lose the Election. The summit was held on Tuesday to prepare for a crunch speech on immigration which Mr Cameron is expected to give within days – which MPs hope will include a vote-winning set of migration curbs. Former government minister Peter Lilley, pictured,  told the meeting that in his opinion, Britain is full . According to one account, the row at Number 10 flared after Mr Lilley demanded a so-called ‘emergency brake’ on migrants from the EU. ‘Most people believe Britain is full – and they are right. We are already a nation of more than 60 million. We cannot take any more and have to shut the door,’ he said. Mr Johnson appeared to suggest immigration fears are exaggerated. He reportedly said that ‘95 per cent of Britain is undeveloped’. One insider said: ‘It sounded as though Johnson was saying there is plenty of room for more immigrants.’ Mr Lilley, who yesterday attended a conference of the Eurosceptic Bruges Group with Mr Reckless, was called ‘shrill’ by Mr Cameron’s immigration special adviser, Daniel Korski, who once worked for the former EU High Commissioner, Labour’s Baroness Cathy Ashton. Others rallied behind Mr Lilley. Lancashire MP Jake Berry said Mr Cameron must not be ‘outflanked’ by Ed Miliband. The Labour leader last week pledged to deny dole to new EU immigrants for two years. Many Tory MPs want an even longer ban. Margot James, pictured, warned the meeting that the Conservative Party should not march to Ukip's tune . A well-placed source said: ‘It was pretty lively. It was Jo, Margot and Korski versus Lilley and the rest.’ Mr Johnson, 42, has argued for stronger ties with India. Some pundits say he is brainier than brother Boris and could beat him to the Tory leadership. A former banker, he is married to Amelia Gentleman, who writes for the Guardian newspaper. Millionairess entrepreneur Ms James, 57, is the first openly lesbian Conservative MP. She gave those at the meeting a written statement, which said: ‘There is a danger that the anti-immigration and anti-EU minority tail is wagging the majority British dog. There is a clear case that needs to be made for immigration. Their role in wealth creation should not be underestimated. ‘The day people are put off by the constant negative rhetoric about people coming to this country, and stop coming, is the day we will have far more to worry about.’ She is said to have highlighted a recent poll which showed that more than two thirds of the public would not vote for Ukip in any circumstance. Mr Lilley, 71, a hardliner on welfare and immigration, once wrote a pamphlet entitled ‘Immigration, too much of a good thing’. In 1992 he called for an end to the ‘something for nothing society’ via a parody of the Lord High Executioner’s ‘Little List’ song from Gilbert and Sullivan’s Mikado. A source said: ‘Jo Johnson and Korski are part of the cosy Downing St chumocracy. They just don’t get ordinary people’s concerns about immigration.’ Jo Johnson, left, head of David Cameron's policy unit called for calm claiming that fears over immigration are being 'exaggerated'. However, one Tory branded Johnson  as part of 'the cosy Downing St chumocracy' But a Government aide said there was concern at the tone of some of the comments, adding: ‘Some of them sounded more like Nigel Farage than Conservative MPs. They were coming out with crude stuff like “we’ve got to stop Poles stealing the jobs of our voters”.’ The Prime Minister has discussed with aides the logistics of imposing a ‘brake’ on individual EU countries when, for example, migrants reach a specified proportion of the UK’s population. He has been advised by the Foreign Office that as the treaties stand, any brake could only be triggered in the event of an emergency such as a natural disaster. In his article, Mr Walker says his party ‘put aside its moral compass’ during the Rochester by-election by ‘banging on’ about immigration. ‘We fought the wrong campaign against Mark Reckless and have paid the price,’ he writes. ‘In recent weeks and months we have allowed the terms of the debate to be framed and set by the pernicious, dripping, corrosive cynicism of Ukip.’ And in his article, below, Mr Davis says: ‘The Rochester result is not some bolt out of the blue. It is the inevitable result of the most dramatic shift in voter behaviour in our lifetimes.’ Last night, Mr Johnson declined to comment. But a Number 10 spokesman said: ‘This is not a fair and accurate representation of the meeting.’ When contacted, Mr Lilley also declined to comment on the discussions. Ms James and Mr Berry could not be reached for comment. David Davis, pictured, warned that the Conservatives and Labour can no longer count on the support of two-thirds of the electorate . On Tuesday I walked the streets of Rochester trying to persuade Ukip voters to vote Conservative. As I did so, in the Commons the Government was suffering a defeat on pub regulation, as publicans won the right to buy beers from somebody other than the owner of their pub chain. It was a victory for private enterprise over big business. The Government was seen to be on the side of big business. Only the week before, it effectively denied the house a proper debate on the critical European Arrest Warrant. The voters of Rochester would have said, ‘I told you so’. They would see these incidents as part and parcel of the problem with modern politics, that the leadership of all the main parties are aloof, out of touch and have little interest in ordinary people. Emily Thornberry’s tactless tweet characterised all too clearly what an ever growing part of the electorate see as the Westminster elite’s scornful view. The Rochester result is not some bolt out of the blue. It is the inevitable result of the most dramatic shift in voter behaviour in our lifetimes. As it stands, 44 per cent of voters will back a different party at the General Election than in 2010. The biggest migrants are Conservatives joining Ukip, and Liberal Democrats joining Labour. But all parties are losing significant support to ‘don’t know’. As a result, the Conservatives and Labour can no longer command even two-thirds of the electorate’s support. The sense of rejection of the establishment was put best by the victim of Emily Thornberry’s tweet when he said, ‘I’ve not voted and I’m not going to. No matter who you have in, it doesn’t matter.’ This sense of disenfranchisement hurts all of us, but as the party in power it hurts us most of all. This is why on the best polls available in the Conservatives’ marginal seats, those commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, we seem set to lose a disastrous proportion. After Tony Blair stood down in 2007 there was a public desire for clarity, coherence and principle after years of spin. We were unable to harness it in 2010. I believe it is not too late to tap into that mood now. In the six months leading up to the General Election, we are free of the shackles of the Coalition. What we say and do are more about what happens after the Election than before. That means we should be able to address the issues of Europe, immigration, welfare and taxation with more clarity than has been the case in the last four years. Lord Ashcroft's polls of marginal seats show the Conservatives losing 'a disastrous proportion' But in the end the public are not just making a judgement on policy. They are also making a judgment on character. They want to believe that their leaders understand their problems, care about their problems, and have the courage, strength and clarity of purpose to do something about them. This is the yawning gap between Britain’s political leadership and the people they serve that has to be closed. If we can do that, we will win the next Election. If not, no amount of incompetence on the part of Labour will save us from yet another defeat.","An immigration summit prompted rebel Tory MPs to demand strong action .

"It's one of the most memorable tunes in the history of pop. Acker Bilk’s 1961 hit Stranger On The Shore is the biggest-selling instrumental single of all time – and became the first British recording ever to reach No 1 in the US charts. Now, 53 years after its release, and in the month in which clarinettist Acker Bilk sadly passed away at the age of 85, the premises in London’s Holland Park where he recorded the famous track have been put on the market for £7.5 million – as a four-bedroom flat. Until eight years ago the property was Lansdowne Studios – one of the most famous recording spaces in London where, besides Bilk, stars such as Shirley Bassey, Queen, Bryan Ferry and John Lennon laid down tracks. Spatial and Interior designer Audrey Lovelock and her husband Jeff, 50, bought the property from the studio’s owner and engineer Adrian Kerridge in 2006. Vast: The kitchen and studio area, which was once a studio, where artists including Shirley Bassey, recorded . Audrey, 52, recalls the couple living in the space for a year with their teenage sons before she began realising their dream of converting it into the apartment it is today. ‘We hadn’t even got full planning permission when we bought it and a number of things had to be ironed out before we could get started,’ she says. ‘Of course it had the huge studio window which separated the mixing desks from the studio area. The boys loved it – because of the soundproofing, they could have 20 mates around and we wouldn’t even know they were there.’ Clarinettist Acker Bilk recorded 1961 hit Stranger On The Shore on the premises . The flat is in Lansdowne House, which was built in 1904 as a place where struggling painters could work. There are 11 other flats in the building. At Lansdowne Studios, besides the studio space there was a ‘smoking room’ and a thermal bath. The transformation of the property into a luxury living space took five years – and Audrey not only needed her design skills but a great deal of logic, too, as she wrestled with complex problems involving wiring and plumbing. ‘I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for,’ she jokes. Such was the transformation of the property that it was featured in magazines and on TV shows, including Grand Designs. Audrey’s job was made easier by some of the natural features of the space, which is spread over three floors – lower ground, ground and first floor, including its 12ft windows in the ground floor reception room, and the original fireplaces (Audrey has restored the building’s 90ft chimney). She also rescued some parquet flooring, which has been put to use in the reception room. Taking centre stage in the flat are two beautifully crafted skylights, installed by the Lovelocks. The four double bedrooms each has an en suite bathroom, and there’s a luxury wet room, gym, cinema room and wine room. There are two terraces, one of which can be used for parking. What was once the studio space is now the vast kitchen/dining area. Distinctive: The exterior of the building in London's Holland Park which was formerly home to Lansdowne Studios . Adrian Kerridge clearly remembers the day Acker Bilk arrived to record his most famous song in this space. ‘It was a three-hour session and Acker was recording with the Leon Young String Chorale. There were about 25 musicians in there – violins, violas, cellos. In those days they all played live together – there was none of the individual “takes” you get now and they had it all wrapped up in 25 minutes. The song was then called Jenny, as it was written for his wife. Acker called everyone “Dad” for some reason and he kept saying “Is that all right, Dad?” when we were recording it.’ Price £7.5 million . Location: Holland Park, London . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Luxury wet room, gym, cinema room and wine room; starred in Grand Designs; fascinating history as a recording studio; the place where Acker Bilk recorded Stranger On The Shore . Kerridge has a very different memory of the day riotous punk band The Sex Pistols came to record at Lansdowne. ‘They were a very rough-and-ready crowd,’ he recalls. ‘They were doing a night session and I came in the following morning. They had sprayed shaving foam all over the studio window, their dog had messed on the carpet and they had spilled wine over a mixing desk!’ Audrey is keen to keep alive the musical memories of her flat and has portraits of a number of the artists who recorded there – including The Sex Pistols – on the wall.

The result is a visually stunning piece of film-making which offers viewers breathtaking aerial perspectives of the Old City and other famous landmarks. Jerusalem is like nowhere else on earth, not only is it one of the oldest cities in the world, but it is considered holy by three major world religions - Christians, Jews and Muslims.

Ferguson, who produced the movie along with Taran Davies and George . Duffield. 'Jerusalem' presents the story from several perspectives and features three teenage girls, one from each faith - Farah Ammouri, a Muslim, Nadia Tadros, from a Greek Orthodox and Catholic family, and Revital Zacharie, a Jew – who each took Ferguson on a (separate) one-day tour of Jerusalem, which he filmed. 'Our goal was to look at the roots of the universal attachment to Jerusalem: Jewish, Christian and Muslim,’ explained Ferguson. For those of the Jewish faith, Jerusalem represents their homeland. Every synagogue in the world faces Jerusalem, and three times a day, Jews pray towards the temples that once stood here above 'the Kotel' or Western Wall. They believe prayers pass through the Kotel to God. For Christians, Jerusalem is the place where Jesus was arrested and sentenced to death nearby in the Garden of Gethsemane. The Via Dolorosa, or ‘Way of Sorrows,’ is said to be the path Jesus took on his way to crucifixion.

From the Damascus Gate and the Dome of the Rock, to the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the girls each reveal the Holy City from their own perspective. ‘What was really amazing was that they would bring me to some of the same places in the city and tell me entirely different things,' said Ferguson. 'Revital would point out Jewish history, but when I asked her if she knew about the Christian or Muslim attachment to the same places, she didn’t. The same was true of the other girls.' ‘We hope the juxtaposition of these different religions and cultures - all with profound spiritual and historical connections to the city - will reveal how much Jews, Christians and Muslims have in common and inspire all of us to better understand each other.'

'It's a living city, and it's a city that's been inhabited continuously for thousands of years,' Magness told NBC News. 'Unless, God forbid, the city is ever completely abandoned, we'll never get a complete picture.' In the film, Dr. Magness leads a group of students through an ancient water tunnel beneath the biblical-era city of Jerusalem, which conveyed water from the Gihon Spring outside the city walls to the residents of the city in the event of a siege by an invading army. She also gives audiences a tour of excavations around the Western Wall, marveling at one of the greatest feats of engineering in the ancient world.

"The children of a 48-year-old stroke victim have been forced into a lengthy battle with the NHS after doctors placed a controversial ‘do not resuscitate’ order on their father. Days after Paul Scoble was admitted to Basildon Hospital in Essex, doctors applied to put the DNR notice on his medical notes – meaning they would let him die if he suffered a cardiac arrest. The orders are controversial because they can be applied despite strong objections from relatives if doctors think they are in a patient’s ‘best interests’. Since August, doctors have applied four times to put a DNR on Mr Scoble, who has extensive brain damage. He is immobile, confined to an intensive care bed, reliant on a ventilator and largely unable to communicate. Support: Danielle with her father, Paul, who is being treated at Basildon Hospital after he suffered a stroke . But his son Leon and daughter Danielle believe he could recover – and want him moved. They claim Basildon Hospital has ‘given up’ on him, and an independent specialist brought in by the hospital to assess the case said he should be resuscitated, if needed, adding: ‘It is my opinion that full active treatment is in Paul’s best interests.’ Dr Chris Danbury found there had been ‘considerable improvement in his neurology’, and he was ‘noticeably more awake and interactive’. He said he had seen similar patients recover to ‘a reasonable functional state’ – although others had died. The hospital ‘categorically refutes’ any allegation it has ‘given up’ on the case. A spokesman said: ‘We would not deny Mr Scoble the opportunity of life-saving treatment if that was a realistic option.’ But Leon Scoble, 28, from Harlow, Essex, claimed he and his sister had been forced to battle doctors from the start. He said: ‘I’m not going to let him go without fighting my hardest. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. ‘That’s my dad. But the doctors at Basildon – they can’t understand that. Their attitude was, “We are going to give up”. But they never thought that we would actually fight it. ‘If you believe something’s wrong, don’t you fight it?’ He claimed his father understood and had mouthed ‘Don’t stop’ to him. Miss Scoble, 29, said last month one doctor advised them to ‘seriously consider’ what their father’s life would be like if he lived on. The hospital, based in Essex, 'categorically refutes' any allegation it has ‘given up’ on the case . If he is to survive, Mr Scoble must have an operation to fix two leaky heart valves and be ‘weaned’ off his ventilator. Dr Danbury believes it is ‘more likely than not that he will die’ due to this treatment. But Miss Scoble said: ‘We’ve got to give him that chance.’ Doctors first applied for a DNR on August 20, then again on September 9. It was finally imposed on October 14, but was rescinded the next day after the siblings got lawyers involved. On October 22, doctors reactivated the DNR, said Miss Scoble. It is now suspended while the family wait to hear if the Royal Brompton Hospital in London will admit Mr Scoble. Doctors there say he ‘definitely should be considered for surgery’ but the risk of death is ‘extremely high’. They want to assess him in person. A Basildon Hospital spokesman said last night: ‘We categorically refute any allegations that we have neglected Mr Scoble. We have done everything we can to deliver the best possible care in very difficult circumstances.’ He said NHS England officials agreed the hospital was ‘offering the most appropriate care’ based on the independent review. He added that doctors were awaiting Royal Brompton’s decision, and insisted: ‘We haven’t given up on him.’","Days after stroke victim Paul Scoble, 48, was admitted to hospital, doctors applied to put a Do Not Resuscitate notice on his medical notes .

"No relief in sight: Energy Secretary Ed Dacey said yesterday that he believes the British public will face further price rises in the future . Fuel prices will continue to soar, the Energy Secretary said yesterday – as he ruled out moves to cut punishing green taxes. Ed Davey said there was no respite in sight for hard-pressed families struggling to pay their fuel bills, adding: ‘I think we will see more price rises.’ The Liberal Democrat minister said Britain was on the verge of agreeing a £50billion French and Chinese investment in new nuclear power, which is expected to drive bills even higher. And he indicated the Lib Dems will try to block any attempt by David Cameron to reduce so-called green taxes. Downing Street confirmed last week that the Prime Minister has ordered a review into whether some green taxes could be watered down, delayed or scrapped altogether in a bid to ease the misery caused by soaring fuel bills. The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s own figures suggest these levies already add £132.20 a year to the average bill. This figure is set to rise to £270.30 by 2020 as the drive for green energy is stepped up. But the Lib Dems have vowed to block any reduction in green taxes, arguing they are needed to support the development of wind farms and pay for the homes of the poor to be insulated. The Coalition rift means significant progress is unlikely before the election in 2015, when the Tories could pledge to reduce bills by cutting environmental levies. Power company SSE sparked fury last week by announcing plans to increase bills by 8.2 per cent this winter, partly because of green taxes. But Mr Davey – who described Labour’s plan to freeze energy bills as a ‘con’ – told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that further price rises were inevitable. ‘I think we will see more price rises,’ he said. ‘One of the reasons why we’re seeing big energy price rises is the cost of wholesale gas on international markets. Now neither I, you or Ed Miliband can do anything about that. ‘We have also seen a big increase in the network costs because we have got to replace ageing network. These are costs which are impossible to avoid.’ Mr Davey claimed green levies could play a crucial role in reducing energy bills in the long term, adding: ‘People have got to understand what these green taxes actually are. ‘Most of them are actually social policies to help the fuel poor…so I don’t think we want to get rid of those do we?’ He said direct subsidies to wind farms . and other forms of renewable energy added only 4 per cent to bills. He . said the payments were ‘absolutely’ good value for money, despite . widespread criticism. Campaigning: Song writer Sir Tim Rice has been a vocal critic of windfarms and says it is wrong for 'rich twits' to benefit from them at the expense of the average bill payer . Mr Davey said ministers were ‘extremely close’ to announcing a ‘massive’ deal to allow France and China to build new nuclear power stations in Britain. He suggested that Korea and Japan could also play a significant role, despite the latter’s problems in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Details of the deal are likely to be announced this week. EDF energy, which is owned by the French state, and China General Nuclear will be in line for tens of billions of pounds in subsidies over the coming decades in return for building a new generation of nuclear reactors. Mr Davey insisted there would be none of the hidden subsidies that have inflated the cost of nuclear power in the past. But the Government is expected to guarantee nuclear investors a minimum price of £90 per megawatt hour – roughly double the current electricity price – for up to 35 years. The increased cost will be passed on through higher bills. The Department of Energy and Climate Change admits that electricity prices are 15 per cent higher because of green levies and gas prices are 5 per cent higher.","Ed Davey says he was on the verge of agreeing a £50billion investment in new nuclear power, which could drive bills even higher .

"A hospital in Missouri is facing outraged calls to fire an OB-GYN doctor after she publicly posted deeply personal information about one of her patients onto Facebook last week. Dr. Amy Dunbar, who works at St John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis, is under pressure after she initially complained about a patient who was chronically late for her appointments on the social networking site. Dr. Dunbar asked her 470 friends on Facebook whether she should 'show up late for her delivery' after her patient was 'three hours late for her induction.' but went on to divulge in a further comment the patient had previously endured a still-born child. Scroll Down for Video . Dr. Amy Dunbar is in hot water for her remarks which were re-posted by an unknown individual onto the main page of Mercy hospital's Facebook page . Although Dunbar didn't reveal the patient's name, the controversy erupted when someone posted a screenshot of the status and the comments to the hospital's 'Mercy Moms To Be' Facebook page. Critics then flooded to the hospital's . page and said that her discussion of any aspect . of a patients history and case was inappropriate. Dr. Amy Dunbar has not lost her job over the posting she made to Facebook but has received a severe warning from her hospital over the use of social media . However, the post does not reveal specific patient information, such as name and medical status, but does reveal the . patient suffered the tragedy at some stage in her past. 'I hope immediate disciplinary action . is taken against each of these individuals,' wrote Mands Glover on . Mercy’s Moms-to-Be Facebook page. '[Dunbar] should not be allowed to work with patients if she callously . talks about them on her own Facebook page. While she does not name . patients on her page she gives personal information about patients which . could identify who she is talking about,' wrote Facebook user Heather . Tiedemann. Dr. Dunbar, 33, graduated the Medical College of Wisconsin in 2010 and has worked in St. Louis since. Another . poster on the wall disagreed with Glover, stating that 'The patient's . name was never mentioned...there are still thousands of women that match . that description.' Kylie McConville, who wrote the . article on pregnancy website TheBump.com that revealed the post, said, . 'The situation here is amplified because the patient is pregnant, and . the doctor is the one responsible for delivering the baby (and let’s get . real, there’s no way we’re okay with the delivering doctor showing up . LATE to (the) baby’s birth).' The full posting and replies by Dr. Amy Dunbar which mention the stillbirth are seen here in from the St Louis physicians Facebook page . Mercy has not fired Dunbar, but released the following statement: . 'Our . physician leadership has already called Dr. Dunbar. Her comments were . definitely inappropriate. We are also reviewing them to determine if . they violated privacy issues, etc. 'That process requires a more thorough review, but we will determine the appropriate response as quickly as possible. In the meantime, know that our physician organization holds its members to the highest standards and strives to improve our service and clinical care through that process.' Regarding punishment, Mercy said its physician leadership has spoken to Dunbar. This Facebook posting from Heather Tiedemann onto the Mercy Moms To be page expresses the outrage of some towards Dr. Dunbar . Dr. Dunbar works at St. John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis and made the Facebook post last week . 'Mercy holds its physicians and other co-workers to high standards in ensuring the protection of patient information. 'We cannot comment on specific disciplinary actions, but we will use this as an opportunity to reinforce our standards through additional education of our physicians and co-workers, including appropriate use of social media.' Dr. Manny Alvarez, the senior managing health editor of FoxNews.Com was unimpressed. 'The answer is not to get mad at the patient or to launder your frustrations in public,' said Alvarez, who is also the chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Science at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. 'As a doctor, our role is to heal the sick – but also educate them,' Alvarez said. 'One of the biggest challenges I have as an OB-GYN is to make my point on the significance of a good relationship between a pregnant woman and her obstetrician. This has to start very early in the relationship.'","Dr. Amy Dunbar of St John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri posted her frustrations about a patient who was late for appointments onto Facebook .

"A mural depicting money-grabbing bankers will be removed following complaints that it resembles the anti-Semitic propaganda of Nazi Germany. The provocative painting has appeared on a wall in the predominantly Muslim area of Brick Lane in East London, once a thriving Jewish community. The mural, by international graffiti artist Mear One, shows moustachioed and hooked-nosed bankers huddled around a Monopoly board supported on the backs of the working class, seemingly drawing on long outdated Jewish stereotypes. Azmel Hussain, pictured, is defending the artwork which has been painted on his property. He described the wall as showing world leaders playing monopoly on a table held up by tax payers . Now the artist has been accused of anti-Semitism, a claim he vehemently denies. But with its continued presence causing public tolerance to fray, council bosses have set a deadline for its removal. Mear One - real name Kalen Ockerman - completed the painting last month in an area steeped in Jewish history. Orthodox immigrants fleeing persecution in Tsarist Russia first settled in Brick Lane in the 1880s  and the area remained a proud Jewish neighbourhood until the 1960s. Local councillor and long-term resident Peter Golds has urged the police to pursue the inflammatory artist under race hate laws. He said: ‘When I saw the mural I was shocked. It’s horribly similar to the propaganda used by the Third Reich in Nazi Germany. ‘The money hoarding and hooked-nosed men is classic Nazi. The mural, painted on a wall in Brick Lane, London, has been branded as anti-Semitic by Tower Hamlets council . Local councillor and long-term resident Peter Golds, who has branded the mural anti-Semitic, has urged the police to pursue the inflammatory artist under race hate laws . ‘It’s seriously worrying in an area that is so culturally sensitive - Brick Lane was home to the Jewish community and now home to another immigrant group. He added: ‘It’s intensely racist and has caused a great deal of offence. ‘These horrible stereotypes are not just unpleasant and divisive, they are dangerous as they feed prejudice.’ Lutfur Rahman, the Tower Hamlets mayor, confirmed he had received ‘large numbers’ of negative comments about the mural. Councillor Mr Golds said: 'When I saw the mural I was shocked. It's horribly similar to the propaganda used by the Third Reich in Nazi Germany. The money hoarding and hooked-nosed men is classic Nazi.' He said: ‘I have received a number of complaints that the mural has anti-Semitic images. I share these concerns. Whether intentional or otherwise, the images of the bankers perpetuate anti-Semitic propaganda about conspiratorial Jewish domination of financial and political institutions. ‘Where freedom of expression runs the risk of inciting racial hatred then it is right that such expression should be curtailed. I have asked my officers to do everything possible to see to it that this mural is removed.’ The Revd. Preb. Alan Green, Area Dean of Tower Hamlets and Rector of St John on Bethnal Green, who serves as Chair of the No Place For Hate Forum, said: “Whilst I appreciate street art in Tower Hamlets, it must always respect the principles of our diverse community. This mural uses images that have for centuries been used to incite hatred and persecution against Jewish communities. There is no place for such incitement against any community in this borough”. But Mr Ockerman claims his mural has been misunderstood and, while it is supposed to provoke critical thought and debate, is not supposed to be anti-Semitic. He said: ‘A group of conservatives do not like my mural and are playing a race card with me.’ By way of explaination the artist, who has been labelled ‘The Michelangelo of Graffiti’ wrote under a video of him creating the artwork on You Tube: . Artist Kalen Ockerman claims his mural has been misunderstood and, while it is supposed to provoke critical thought and debate, is not supposed to be anti-Semitic . He said: ‘My mural is about class & privilege. The banker group is made up of Jewish & white Anglos. For some reason they are saying I am anti semetic[sic]. This I am most defenatly[sic] not. ‘I believe in equality and brother & sisterhood on a global scale. What I am against is class.’ The council has served a notice on the owner of the building to remove the painting within 28 days. If this is not done by 28 days then the council will take further action. A council spokesperson said: ‘The mural in Hanbury Street is not on council property but we are responding to a number of complaints about it. We are working with the police in order to establish how best to proceed.’ Mr Ockerman asked supporters to ‘rally’ at the mural and stop any attempts to remove it.

"It's not likely to be a day they'll ever forget but new mothers are increasingly asking their partners for 'push presents' to mark the occasion they gave birth. The trend from the U.S is catching on in the UK, fuelled by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. She was reportedly given a £500,000 diamond ring from Kanye West after she gave birth to their daughter North this year. Analysis of conversations on parenting website the BabyCentre's online community over the last three years found that mentions of push presents had increased by 41 per cent in the past 18 months, compared to only a two per cent increase between 2011 and 2012. Labour pain to gain: More new mothers in the UK are expecting a 'push present' from their partner . A poll of 1,200 BabyCentre mothers also revealed that more than a quarter (27 per cent) were expecting, or had already received, a 'push present' this year. Diamonds were the most popular gift in the form of an eternity ring with the prices spent ranging from £500 to £1475. Tablet computers, charm bracelets and designer watches and handbags were also popular gifts to celebrate a new arrival.

Sarah Barrett, BabyCentre's managing editor said the rise in popularity of the trend shows how fathers want to reward their partner for the 'huge physical and emotional changes' they've been though in order to give birth. She said: 'Whilst Mums are becoming more vocal about push presents this trend also shows a shift in Dads' understanding around the huge physical and emotional changes that their partner has been through. 'Whilst having a baby is the ultimate present, many Dads want to show how proud they are of their new family and all that Mum has been through with a special gift.' Push presents have been common currency in the U.S. since 2007 when a survey of more than 30,000 respondents found that 38 per cent of new mothers had received a one. It's now the latest trend to cross the Atlantic following 'sip and see' parties - where friends and family are invited for drinks to meet the newborn for the first time.

"It was the moment the world had been waiting for. Or at least the large portion of the world who harbour an obsession with the Kardashians. Kim Kardashian made her first appearance in public as a mother. And while she kept her style dressed down and sober (is this the new relaxed Kim?), she sure let her accessories do the talking. Not for Kim the everyday nappy bag from Cath Kidston. For her first appearance en famille with baby North and 36-year-old rapper boyfriend Kanye, Kim toted a £20,000 Hermes bag, stuffed full, no doubt, with Swarovski pacifiers, Dior baby bottles and cashmere babygros.

Eschewing heels for once, Kim wore on her feet a pair of tan fringed Minnetonka boots in suede - and Kanye wore his own black fringed pair. It is no secret that the two have long been performing a sort of style merge.

In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim was in tears as Kanye went through her wardrobe with his assistant, throwing out dozens of items of clothes - some she said were her favourite. 'I like that top, it's like 'Yo, I'm getting on best dressed lists now. I'm stepping all into this territory,' he says as he bins heaps of clothes.

As the transformation took hold, it was clear just how much influence Kanye had over his girlfriend when the two started making public appearances dressed eerily similarly. Matching leather outfits, top-to-toe black, co-ordinated urban sportswear... Where Kanye shopped, Kim followed. And now it seems her post-baby wardrobe will be no different. Kanye has spoken in the past of wanting Kim to dress and style herself more 'naturally'. 'I grew up with women in 80s magazines,' he has commented previously.

"This groundbreaking footage signals the moment gamers around the world have been waiting for - the first action movie shot entirely from first person point-of-view cameras. The gory preview of shoot-em-up film, Hardcore, will seem oddly familiar to anyone who has spent hours playing computer games such as the hugely popular Call of Duty. The film, which stars District 9 actor Sharlto Copley, has been 18 months in the making and now its creator is hoping to raise £160,000 to add the post-production special-effects needed for it to be cinema worthy. Scroll down for video . Groundbreaking: Hardcore is the first full-lenth film to be shot in the first person point-of-view (POV) Hardcore is also the first full-length movie to be shot using the Go Pro camera - a device that straps to the a helmet or other part of the body making it increasingly popular with extreme sports fans. The film was created by Ilya Naishuller and was inspired by a similarly-shot short film he made for his band's music video - which earned more than 40 million views online. Timur Bekmambetov, the director of Wanted and Night Watch, approached Mr Naishuller about making the full-length feature. Mr Naishuller initially dismissed the offer as 'gimmicky', but was soon convinced and now the pair are trying to raise £160,000 for post-production costs on the crowd fundraising site Indiegogo.

A mother says she is in a 'race against the clock' to save her anorexic daughter's life - but fears the NHS will not give her the help she needs. Gill Barlow, says her daughter Jasmin is in desperate need of specialist care after the illness destroyed one of her kidneys and left her weighing just six stone. Despite the devastating effect on her health, she claims mental health officials . have so far failed to arrange appropriate care for her, which has . resulted in repeated emergency admissions to general wards. 'Every day, Jasmine wakes up and asks herself ""will I die today"",' she said. 'She needs far more help from the NHS or she will die. They’re not giving her the care she needs and this has been going on about two years. 'She’s had about 25 emergency admissions in that time and we’re just going round in circles. 'I feel like I’m racing against the clock to get her the right treatment.' Ms Barlow wants her daughter to be in an eating disorder unit with the right specialists giving her the attention she needs. 'We’ve been told she will definitely need dialysis and a kidney transplant but she’ll need to be in a better physical state before that happens - and she can’t do that without more help,' she added. Jasmin, 26, who lives with her mother in Blackburn, Lancashire, has been under the care of the East Lancashire Eating Disorder Service, but this does not cater for patients with acute problems. Ms Barlow added: 'The eating disorder service just isn’t equipped to deal with cases as complex as Jasmin’s, who is also bipolar and has type two bulimia. 'I think they are starting to realise that she needs proper 24-hour care and they’re now trying to get her into the Priory Hospital in Preston, a specialist unit, but we’re still waiting. 'I’ve heard people say that she should just eat but it’s a mental illness and it’s not that simple.' Despite weighing a healthy 10st before she was diagnosed five years ago, Jasmine’s health has rapidly deteriorated and, at 5ft 5in tall, she now weighs 6st. With a body mass index (BMI) of just 14, which is well below the recommended minimum of 18.5, her condition has become so severe that her stomach automatically repels food. Her mother says she has had to fight untill she was 'blue in the face' for the NHS to provide a peg-feed, which can be inserted through her stomach. But . when Jasmin’s mental state deteriorates, she stops using the feed, . which results in her being rushed to hospital with renal failure, due to . dehydration and low potassium levels. Jasmin said: 'I wake up every day in tears and every morning I ask myself ""will I die today?"" Jasmin has been admitted to hospital several times and, at times, has to be fed through a tube in her stomach . Ms Barlow said: 'I feel like I'm racing against the clock to get her the right treatment' 'I desperately want help but the hospital doesn't know what to do with me. 'They don’t seem to understand my illness and I feel like they think I’m being selfish and choosing not to eat. 'But it’s not a choice - it’s a mental illness. There’s so much ignorance surrounding anorexia and bulimia and that makes it so much harder to recover. I want nothing more than to get better but I feel so alone. 'Anorexia is a physical illness as well as a mental one and the mental health ward only offers me therapy. 'I need to be in a proper eating disorder unit that specialises in treating people with the illness. If they don’t address the problem soon I will die.' Jasmin said: 'I wake up every day in tears and every morning I ask myself ""will I die today?""' Blackburn . with Darwen Clinical Commissioning Group said the Eating Disorder . Service will be a priority in its commissioning plans for 2015/16. In a statement provided to MailOnline, Shelley French, Eating Disorder Team Manager at Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'The Trust’s Eating Disorder service provides assessment and treatment interventions within the community, for people presenting with a primary eating disorder. 'The team works closely with other organisation including the Hospitals Trust to support service users who may require secondary care services. 'We are unable to discuss details relating to an individual’s care due to confidentiality reasons.'

"Families of victims of the 7/7 London bombings have slammed the BBC for a 'disgusting' documentary that investigates conspiracy theories surrounding the atrocity. The programme, to be aired on BBC3 and hosted by Irish comedian Andrew Maxwell, probes claims that the co-ordinated blasts were in fact part of a Government plot to boost support for the Iraq war. The attacks killed 52 people when four suicide bombers detonated their home made devices on Tubes and a bus during the morning rush-hour commute. 'Disgusting': Programme makers even blow up a London bus in the documentary that explores the theory that the 7/7 bombings were in fact a government plot to garner support for the 'war on terror' In tonight's documentary show producers blow up a double-decker London bus in a bid to recreate the explosion in Tavistock Square that killed 13 people. It also features conspiracy theorists - including model Layla Randle-Conde - playing the parts of the bombers in a reconstruction of events. June Taylor, whose daughter Carrie, . 24, died in the underground blast near Aldgate Station told The Sun: . 'The BBC can’t get any lower than this. They should have spoken to the families.' Branding the programme 'disgusting', she added: 'They are trivialising the tragedy. People don’t want to be back in that dark . place. It puts us through the pain all over again.' Carnage: Thirteen people were killed when a bomb detonated on board the Number 30 bus in Tavistock Square . Kim Beer, 54, of Borehamwood, Herts, who lost her son Philip, 22, in the Tube . blast near King’s Cross said it was in 'really bad taste', adding: 'How do they . think we live with this?' A BBC spokeswoman said of 7/7 Bombings: Conspiracy Road Trip: 'The series takes conspiracy theorists on a journey to fully explore the facts and challenge their beliefs.' Between 8.50am and 9.47am on July 7 2005, four British Muslims - Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, . Jermaine Lindsay, 19, and Hasib Hussain, 18 - blew themselves up using . home-made explosives, killing 56 (including themselves) and injuring 700 on three Tube trains . and a double-decker bus. Angry: June Taylor (left, with husband john), whose daughter Carrie, . 24, died in the blast near Aldgate Station branded the show 'disgusting'. It is hosted by Irish comedian Andrew Maxwell (right) They had travelled on a mainline train from Luton into King's Cross . Thameslink Station in London, each carrying a heavy rucksack of . explosives. It is a timeline that has been endorsed by a high-level . Parliamentary inquiry and a government report, both published in May . 2006 ten months after the event, based on 12,500 statements, a police . examination of 142 computers and 6,000 hours of CCTV footage. The report insisted that the bombers carried out the attacks on their own, constructing . explosives from chapatti flour and hair bleach mixed in the bath at a . flat in Leeds, Yorkshire, where all four had family and friends. However there have since been a wave of conspiracy theories around the attacks. One . of the more popular accuses then Prime Minister Tony Blair, the . Government, the police, and the British and Israeli Secret Services of . murdering the innocent people to stir up anti-Islamic fervour and create . public support for the 'war on terror' and looming war in Iraq. Suicide bombers: Four British Muslims - Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, . Jermaine Lindsay, 19, and Hasib Hussain, 18 - used home-made explosives to carry out the attacks . It also alleges that the four British . Muslims were tricked by the authorities into taking part in what they . were told would be a mock anti-terror training exercise. What they weren't told, it is claimed, . was that the Government was going to blow them up, along with other . passengers, then pretend the four were suicide bombers. Theorists have also accused government agents of setting off pre-planted explosives under the three Tube trains and on the bus. The aftermath: Theorists have also accused government agents of setting off pre-planted explosives under the three Tube trains and on the bus . They . suggest that the four Muslims were not, in fact, on any of the Tube . trains, claiming that they missed them altogether because of the train . delays on the Luton to London line. Some . even believe that because the four did not get onto the Tube on time, . three of them were murdered by police at Canary Wharf later that morning . and the fourth - the bus bomber - ran off. An earlier version of this article carried a headline which said that the documentary suggested that the Government had plotted the 7/7 attacks.  We accept that this was seriously wrong: the true position was, as explained in the article, that the programme actually challenged the beliefs of the conspiracy theorists and did not suggest that the Government was in any way responsible for the attacks.  We apologise for the error.","The BBC3 documentary shows conspiracy theorists - including model Layla Randle-Conde - play the bombers .

"Gutted by fire and currently uninhabitable, even an estate agent could not hide the problems with this property. However, that did not stop one woman bidding $790,000 for the smoke-strained ruin in St Peter's, Sydney, despite her husband's attempts to stop her. Footage shot at the auction shows an increasingly desperate George Ge tugging at Sonia Chen's arm in a futile bid to keep her out of the bidding war. Scroll down for video . A determined wife has completely gone against the wishes of her concerned husband after bidding nearly $1 million at auction for an unliveable house . He eventually had to admit defeat and a delighted Mrs Chen secured the cottage for $90,000 above the reserve. Over 20 potential buyers registered to bid on the property and the bids came thick and fast for the sought-after house. Bidding on the three-bedroom house began at $550,000 but rose after a quick-fire round of bids. The house ended up selling for $790,000, which is significantly higher than the Sydney median house price of $725,000. Nothing could deter Sonia Chen from forking out $970,000 for the property . Sonia's husband George was at a loss as to how to control his wife at the auction . Sonia can be seen looking triumphant at the end of the video, as her wary husband cowers behind his hands, clearly dreading the renovation process to come. In an interview following the sale, a dumbfounded Mr Ge revealed to Channel 9 that he was at a loss as to how the couple would face the imminent renovations. 'She is excited, not me,' he said, referring to his ecstatic wife, who could not hide her broad smile. 81 Frederick St, St Peters has some unavoidable flaws - including being gutted by a sever fire and being within stomping distance to the airport . The auctioneer appeared to be delighted that the house went for $90,000 over the reserve price . When reporters questioned  Mr Ge on why wasn't more enthusiastic about his investment, he replied: 'Because I have to do, a lot of work for this one... I don't know how to do that,' Mr Ge revealed that the purchase was an impulse buy on his wife's part and he was at a loss to what would happen next. 'Not very planned, not very prepared, but she is determined' he said. 'I don't really know what to do next.' The house was gutted by a raging blaze in August and left extensive smoke damage throughout the property. Over 20 bidders registered for the auction . Sonia Chen was ecstatic when she was the final bidder standing . The previous owner, Tom Noicos, was forced to sell-up after his insurance company suspected arson was involved in the demise of the home and refused to pay him any compensation for the tragedy. Speaking to Domain,Noicos said he was devastated when his three-bedroom home was destroyed, but can see the silver lining in the huge profit he has made. 'I always think from all that's bad something good happens,' the former IT worker said. 'The price was good and if I can find the right place [to move] that will be even better.' The house was gutted by fire in August and left extreme smoke damage throughout . The previous owner, Tom Noicos, was forced to sell the house after his insurance company suspected foul play in the fire . He said he will use the money from the sale to finance a new property.

According to Channel 9, $7.7 billion dollars is expected to be spent on the housing market in NSW in 2014. The most popular areas for renovations in Sydney are the lower north shore and the eastern suburbs . Auctioneer Damian Cooley told Channel 9: 'Buyers always like to add value, they like to renovate a home tp their own tastes and what we saw today was a very strong auction.'

"Firebrand senator Jacqui Lambie is warning her opponents they will need at least an M60 gun to halt her plans to leave the Palmer United Palmer and become an independent. Senator Lambie is looking to break from the party after a public spat with leader Clive Palmer over her pledge to vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal is reconsidered. The controversial politician said Mr Palmer had been exhausting all options to try and influence her vote, including enlisting the help of fellow senator and rugby great Glenn Lazarus. But Senator Lambie is standing her ground, telling the Sunday Telegraph she would not cave that easily. Scroll down for video . Firebrand senator Jacqui Lambie is warning her critics will need at least an 'M60' gun to halt her plans to leave the Palmer United Palmer and become an independent . 'If you want to intimidate Jacqui Lambie you'll have to bring in a M60 and we will start with that,' Senator Lambie said. 'I won't be intimidated. I won't tolerate it. No, they'd be wasting their time trying to intimidate me sweetheart.' Despite sources telling the News Corp newspaper Senator Lazarus marched into her office and pressed her to vote in line with her party, the former sportsman said this was not the case and all decisions were made by the caucus. He said his main concern about the 'passionate and committed' politician was the advice her chief-of-staff was handing out to Senator Lambie. Speculation over Senator Lambie's future in the party has been mounting over the weekend as she seeks legal advice to see if she can run as an independent. To go with her new role as independent, her chief-of-staff Rob Messenger said his boss had 'undergone a two-and-a-half-hour procedure at the hairdressers' and bought new clothes to get 'a new look'. Senator Lambie is looking to break from the party after a public spat with leader Clive Palmer over her pledge to vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal is reconsidered . It comes after PUP leader Clive Palmer extended an olive branch to the troublesome senator, saying she is a team player who he wants to keep on board. But her claims of intimidation and interference from the party leader has sparked retaliation from Mr Palmer who accused her of lying in parliament and scheming to start her own political party. Despite the war of words, Mr Palmer is not giving up Senator Lambie, urging her to talk to him in person rather than through media. Previously, Mr Palmer has said Senator Lambie had failed to attend party meetings and had not returned his phone calls or spoken to him for a month. 'I think she's a team player and we'd like to keep her on board,' he told ABC's Lateline on Thursday. 'If she wants to have a talk I'd have no problem doing that.' Mr Palmer said he did not know where Senator Lambie's accusations of intimidation had come from and his party had done all it could to support her. He excused her behaviour as a result of media pressure to break up the PUP team. On Wednesday, Mr Palmer demoted the senator from her parliamentary positions of deputy Senate leader and deputy whip, and suspended her from all party meetings. After removing PUP logos and references from her website, the Tasmanian senator split from her party colleagues in the upper house to vote against the government on a series of motions. Senator Lambie has thrown her support behind the Australian Defence Veterans Party which is in the final stages of getting enough supporters to register with the Australian Electoral Commission. She also denied claims she wanted to set up her own party.

"Ultra-Orthodox Jewish demonstrators caused outrage today by dressing children as Holocaust victims to protest against what they see as persecution of devout Jews seeking gender separation in Israel. A boy wearing a cloth cap and the sidecurls of an Orthodox Jew was the centrepiece of the Jerusalem protest late on New Year's Eve. His hands were raised in surrender and a yellow Star of David inscribed with 'Jude', Jew, in German, was sewn on his jacket. The image mimicked a memorable photo of a terrified Jewish boy during a round-up in the Nazi-occupied Warsaw Ghetto in World War Two. 'Nazis, Nazis,' some of the protesters shouted at police. The Ultra-Orthodox Jewish boy wearing a cloth cap and a yellow Star of David inscribed with 'Jude', Jew, in German, sewn on his jacket, raises his handcuffed hands during a protest in Jerusalem's Mea Shearim neighbourhood on New Year's Eve . The boy's appearance in Jerusalem echoes that of the youngster (right) in this image taken in 1943 in the Warsaw Ghetto when terrified Jewish families surrendered to Nazi soldiers. Earlier that year the residents of the ghetto rose up against the Nazis and held their ground for several months, but were defeated after fierce fighting in April and May . A group of ultra-Orthodox adults and children wearing concentration camp uniforms sit in a truck with bars. During the demonstration they protested at what they called the 'media campaign of incitement' being waged against their community . A Jewish family in Amsterdam wearing the yellow stars marking them out as Jews. The picture was taken in June 1943 and the family had just been arrested. They were ordered to leave their house and go to a Nazi concentration camp in Poland . Other children and young men were dressed in replicas of striped concentration camp uniforms at the protest attended by hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews in traditional black garb. 'Prisoner uniforms and yellow patches with the word ""Jew"" written on them in German are shocking and appalling,' said Defence Minister Ehud Barak in a statement. 'The use of yellow patches and small children raising their hands in surrender crosses a red line which the ultra-Orthodox leadership, who are largely responsible people, must not accept.' Israel is in the grip of an emotional debate over attempts by Jewish zealots to impose and enforce gender separation in ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and other public places. Much of the controversy has stemmed from ultra-Orthodox men trying to force women to sit in the back of public buses in deference to religious beliefs against any mixing of the sexes in public. President Shimon Peres has described the debate as a battle for the soul of the Jewish state. The issue jumped to the top of the . public agenda in Israel nearly two weeks ago when an eight-year-old girl . complained on television that ultra-Orthodox men spat at her on the way . to school, accusing her of dressing immodestly. Prime . Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has political alliances with . ultra-Orthodox parties but is facing mounting public anger over such . incidents, has vowed to crack down on zealots who harass women. Israel is in the grip of an emotional debate over attempts by Jewish zealots to impose and enforce gender separation in ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and other public places. Posters at the protest accused the 'Zionist entity' of carrying out 'an unprecedented attack on the ‘Haredi’ community', referring to ultra-Orthodox Jews. Some groups within the ultra-Orthodox community do not recognise Israel, saying such a state can only be established with the coming of the Messiah. 'You will not be able to impose on us sinful (Western) culture. We will remain faithful to the laws of Holy Torah,' read one protest sign at Saturday’s demonstration. Speakers at the protest singled out an activist, jailed for vandalising a computer store he deemed heretical in an ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood, as a victim of what they called government persecution. Avner Shalev, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel’s national memorial to the six million Jews killed by the Nazis, said the protesters’ use of Holocaust imagery was a 'profound insult' to survivors. 'This is totally unacceptable and degrades Jewish values,' Shalev said on Israel Radio.","Claim devout Jews are being persecuted for wanting gender separation in public places .

"A state trooper has been suspended after pointing a gun at a teenager when he pulled over her car at a traffic stop. Timothy Wagner, of Michigan State Police, drew the weapon at the 18-year-old near Sturgis after he clocked her red Pontiac doing 77 mph in a 55 mph zone. After being handcuffed and taken into the trooper's car, she told him she was speeding after receiving a call that her family home had been broken into. Scroll down for video . The state trooper draws his firearm and starts to approach the teenage girl's car . The pictures came from the trooper's dashboard camera during the incident near Sturgis in Michigan . But despite confirming that was in fact the case, Mr Wagner then asks her, 'How'd you like having a gun pointed?' It is then claimed the trooper said to the teenager that she should take it as a learning experience even though he should probably take her to jail as she refused to stop when asked to pull over. Video from the officer's dashboard camera shows the girl being pulled over before the state trooper approaches her vehicle with his firearm pointed. It is thought she was on her way home from baseball practice and was still wearing her training kit at the time of the incident. The girl is then handcuffed and taken into Mr Wagner's car where she apologises for going fast but says her home is being broken into. The girl, who was on her way home from baseball practice, raises her hands as she gets out of her car . However, he asks her, 'How'd you like having a gun pointed' before the rest of the conversation become inaudible. The incident was investigated by the local St Joseph County Prosecutor, but they decided it did not warrant any criminal charges. However, prosecutor John McDonough says he was 'appalled and disgusted' by the incident. An internal investigation is also being carried out by the Michigan State Police and Mr Wagner is suspended with pay pending the results of the probe. The investigation was prompted after the teenage girl's parents complained about the incident. Her father says she was crying when she arrived home and told him that a gun had been pointed at her. The 18-year-old then walks back to her vehicle. Her parents then complained about the trooper's conduct . However, in a written statement by Mr Wagner to Detective 1st Lieutenant Chuck Christensen, obtained by the Kalamazoo Gazette, the state trooper says the fatal shooting of a fellow colleague was playing on his mind. Trooper Paul Butterfield was shot dead during a routine traffic stop in Mason County last year. The paper reports Mr Wagner as saying: 'With the recent incident involving the murder of Trooper Paul Butterfield while approaching a vehicle at the forefront of my mind I elected to 'clear' the vehicle for my safety as I feel the vehicle could have suddenly pulled to the side in an effort to lure me into a vulnerable position where I could easily be shot.'","State Trooper Timothy Wagner pulled over girl's car near Sturgis in Michigan .

"A woman featured in a reality TV show about a polygamous family is going public about sex abuse she claims she suffered as a child in hopes of changing a culture of secrecy plaguing plural families in Utah. Rosemary Williams of 'My Five Wives' on TLC says she was molested more than two decades ago by her father, Lynn A. Thompson and published her claims in a blog. He is the leader of the one of largest organized polygamy groups in Utah, the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB. The AUB is estimated to be the second-largest polygamist church in Utah behind Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on the Utah-Arizona border. Unlike Jeffs' group, which has been plagued for years by allegations of abuse and child brides, the Apostolic United Brethren in northern Utah has a clean reputation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaking out: . Rosemary Williams of 'My Five Wives' on TLC says she was molested more than two decades ago by her father, Lynn A. Thompson and published her claims in a blog . Accused: Alleged molester Lynn A. Thompson . is the leader of the one of largest organized polygamy groups in Utah, the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB . Thompson said the allegations were not true when contacted by The Associated Press on Friday. He did not immediately respond to a phone message on Saturday. Rosemary Williams says her father fondled her when she was 12 years old. She told The Associated Press that she does not plan to file a criminal accusation or a lawsuit against her father because she doesn't think that will do any good. She says she wants to prevent him from abusing others, especially given his recent appointment as president of the AUB, which has up to 7,500 followers across the West. Williams also hopes to be an advocate for abuse victims in patriarchal societies like the one she was raised in, where families are often fearful to report crimes out of concern they may be prosecuted under polygamy laws. She doesn't believe sex abuse is widespread among the polygamous group, but she wants mothers to be able to come forward and report it and other forms of abuse when they occur. 'The reason people are afraid to say anything is because they are upholding somebody in a position of authority and they're taught to respect them,' Williams said. Polygamist marriage: Rosemary Williams is a memeber of a polygamous family (pictured) and is going public about sex abuse she claims she suffered as a child in hopes of changing a culture of secrecy . 'They are afraid of the repercussions. They are afraid of Utah coming down on them and carrying their kids out of their home.' A search of criminal charges available online show no record of any criminal convictions for Thompson, and the Utah Attorney General's Office is unaware of any formal complaints submitted against Thompson, said spokeswoman Missy Larsen. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said he couldn't comment on the matter. David Watson, a spokesman for the AUB, didn't return multiple phone calls from The AP. Rosemary Williams is Brady Williams' third wife. He and his five wives and their combined 24 children are featured in the TLC reality show, 'My Five Wives.'They decided to do the show in part to demonstrate that polygamy can be healthy and stable. They live in a rural community outside of Salt Lake City Lake City where most people belong to the group Thompson leads. They no longer are members of the group. They slowly withdrew during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs. They still practice polygamy, but only because they are happy doing so, not out of the fear of hell or the promise of heaven, Brady Williams says. She said she recently confronted her father about what happened. He said he didn't remember and that he would pray to God to remember what happened. She reported the abuse recently to another high-ranking church leader, but nothing was done, she said. Rosemary Williams became choked up and was unable to talk while discussing the reaction she expects from family and friends who are still members of the polygamous group. 'She knows that it will be very strong reprisal,' said Brady Williams, explaining why his wife couldn't speak. 'Her family will probably disown her along with many of her friends.'

"A woman who found a decades-old wedding photograph washed up outside her home in the wake of Hurricane Sandy is returning it to the original owners after a two-year hunt.

The image is thought to be a photograph from the woman's wedding, and show her helping her father prepare to walk her down the aisle. Welsh, from Massapequa, New York, described the moment she found the picture to NBC News. She said: 'I called my husband over and I said, ""Can you believe that I just found a picture?

"The Army has more top brass than battle tanks, alarming statistics have revealed. There are 256 brigadiers and generals but just 200 Challenger II tanks, according to the figures uncovered by a former senior military intelligence officer. It also emerged there are three times more senior officers than Apache attack helicopters, which play a vital role in Afghanistan. Alarming: New figures have found there are more than 250 brigadiers and generals in the British Army but there are just 200 active Challenger tanks . The disturbing imbalances were discovered by Frank Ledwidge, who served on the frontline in Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo. ‘Our priorities are hugely skewed,’ he said. ‘The British Army is over-burdened and over-staffed with senior ranks. ‘We need to think about cutting top brass and the focus now should be on our conflicts rather than promotion.’ He believes retaining so many . one-star generals and above earning £100,000-a-year plus while cutting . spending is devastating morale in the Armed Forces. One tank officer said: ‘When the MoD . is making large cuts to  equipment and personnel, the troops are rightly . going to question why we need to retain so many well-paid senior . officers living a good life.’ The Royal Navy is suffering a similar plight with more admirals than active warships, according to an 2008 study. Following the recent defence cuts, the senior service now has just 20 fighting surface ships, which are destroyers and frigates. Rare sight: The Army has three times more senior officers than it does Apache attack helicopters . Mr Ledwidge’s figures were gleaned . from official statistics and published in his new book Losing Small . Wars: British Military Failure in Iraq and Afghanistan. He claims only around 200 of the UK’s force of 350 Challenger II main battle tanks are in service, with the others in storage. It was reported this year that the . number of tanks in operation could fall as low as 50 as the Ministry of . Defence looks to make £4.7billion of budget cuts. It also needs to . eliminate a £38billion deficit in the equipment programme. At a peak during World War Two, . Britain produced more than 30,000 tanks. The Challenger II main battle . tank is considered the most  complex vehicle in the nation’s arsenal. The Royal Tank Regiment – the world’s . oldest tank unit – has been at the forefront of armoured warfare since . the vehicles were used to smash through First World War German trenches . in 1917. Challenger IIs were used in Iraq in 2003 but the difficult terrain of Afghanistan means they have not been deployed there. Instead, the regiment has transferred . its skills to a new range of more manoeuvrable armoured vehicles, . including Mastiffs and Warthogs, in the fight against the Taliban. The Army currently has more than 3,000 armoured vehicles. The MoD believes the Army can cope . with fewer tanks as traditional heavy warfare will be replaced by more . counter-insurgency campaigns, such as in Afghanistan. Last night the MoD said the number of senior officers had dropped slightly from the figures obtained this year by Mr Ledwidge. A spokesman said: ‘As we restructure . for the future, we are reducing the number of senior officers, which . currently stands at about 230. ‘Modern armies require more than just tanks. Operations require a range of armoured vehicles.’ Under the spending cuts, the Armed . Forces will lose at least 22,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen within . four years, more than ten per cent of their number. The Navy was ordered to axe HMS Ark Royal and retire the fleet of Harrier jump jets. The RAF was forced to send its new Nimrod MRA4 maritime  surveillance aircraft to the wreckers’ yard.","Three times more officers than Apache helicopters .

"Released: Muhammad al-Zahrani, 45, was sent back to his homeland after a U.S. government board decided that he no longer posed a threat . A Saudi citizen with links to al Qaeda has been released from Guantanamo Bay after serving 12 years. Muhammad al-Zahrani, 45, was sent back to his homeland of Saudi Arabia on Friday after a U.S. government board decided that he no longer posed a threat. The move came as the U.S government whittles down the prison population at the controversial prison base in Cuba in a bid to close the controversial base. According to officials, even more prisoners will be released from the site where 142 men are currently held including 73 who have already been cleared for release. Al-Zahrani is the thirteenth prisoner to leave Guantanamo Bay this year and the seventh in just the past two weeks. During his hearing, his lawyers told the review board that he was no longer a threat to the U.S. and was instead a 'middle-aged, ailing man who desperately wanted to return to Saudi Arabia.' They said that he was a changed man because his father had died while he was in U.S. custody and 'his only wish was to see his ailing mother before she passed away.' Closure: The U.S government is attempting to whittle down the prison population at the controversial prison . But the Saudi national is alleged to have traveled to Afghanistan in 1999 and 'almost certainly' joined al-Qaida, trained in military tactics, and fought the Northern Alliance. He was detained at Guantanamo in August 2002. But has agreed to take part in a Saudi program to rehabilitate militants upon his release. It was argued that he was less of a threat than five senior Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo who were exchanged for U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl - the last American prisoner of war in Afghanistan. The Periodic Review Board initially cleared al-Zahrani for release in October, citing a number of factors including his willingness to participate in the rehabilitation program. However, the board decided that a second Saudi inmate with links to . al Qaeda - Muhammed Abd Al Rahman Awn Al-Shamrani - should not be released. Al-Shamrani, 39,  is still regarded as a considerable security threat. He is alleged to have been  a key facilitator and recruiter for al Qaeda and the Taliban in . Saudi Arabia and carried out front line fighting in Afghanistan. He has been held at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base since January 2002, and has served 12 years and 10 months during which time he's had 'significant disciplinary infractions.' Detained: Muhammed Abd Al Rahman Awn Al-Shamrani, pictured here, will stay at the U.S. prison in Cuba because he is still considered to be a considerable security threat . Release: In the coming weeks, more prisoners will be released as part of a renewed effort to close the site . Prison: The controversial base still holds 142 detainees including 73 already cleared for release . The inmates assessments were carried out by the 'Periodic Review Board' which was established to speed up Guantanamo's closing as ordered by President Barack Obama. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is tasked with informing Congress of any U.S.intent to transfer inmates. The controversial base still holds 142 detainees.","Muhammad al-Zahrani was released and sent back to Saudi Arabia on Friday .

"A watch worn by Steve McQueen in the film 'Le Mans' had sold for nearly $800,000 at an auction of film memorabilia. The movie star sported the timepiece in the 1971 action movie set in Monaco about the 24 hours of Le Mans car race. The Tag Heuer Monaco has a black alligator skin strap and a stylish retro 60s style blue face. It was the first ever automatic and square cased chronograph watch. The star wearing the wristwatch helped the brand to become a favourite of motor racing drivers and fans around the world. Steve McQueen wearing the TAG Heuer Monaco chronograph watch in the 1971 movie Le Mans, and right, a close up of the time piece which sold at auction this week for $800,000 . Auctioneers had been expecting it to fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars but the sale surpassed expectations when the hammer came down at a staggering $799,500. A signed U.S. passport belonging to McQueen fetched $46,125 during the auction at Profiles in History in Calabasas Hills, California. Other items that were sold included a miniature drop-ship used in 'Aliens' for $225,000. Groucho Marx's wire-rim glasses from 'A Night at the Opera' for $86,100 and Vivien Leigh's hat from 'Gone with the Wind' for $67,650 were also auctioned off. One bidder paid $98,400 for Marlon Brando's assassination jacket from 'The Godfather.' A personal copy of the 1971 film's script signed by Brando went for $55,000. The buyers were not identified. Classic: A still from the 1971 movie about the 24 Hours of Le Mans motor race, which is considered by racing fans to be one of the greatest motorsports movies of all time . McQueen starred in Le Mans eight years after his most famous movie, The Great Escape. He was arguably at the height of his fame and appeal when he appeared in the film. It is considered by some fans to be one of the greatest motor sports movies of all time for its portrayal of the iconic 24 hours race around the streets of Le Mans in Monaco, France. However, it did relatively badly in the U.S. as audiences were unfamiliar with the race. Tag Heuer was founded in 1860 but after McQueen wore the watch in the film the brand became even more popular among motor sports fans and drivers. The watch is one of several automatic Heuer chronographs that run on the Caliber 11 series of movements. They were introduced in 1969 as a series of wrist watches made in honour of the Monaco Grand Prix.","Star wore timepiece in 1971 film about the 24 hours of Le Mans motor race .

"A British scientist fathered up to 600 children after founding a fertility clinic that promised to provide sperm donors from ‘intelligent stock’, it emerged yesterday. Biologist Bertold Wiesner supplied sperm to the partners of infertile men from the middle and upper classes, including ‘peers of the realm’. His wife Mary Barton later destroyed medical records, meaning most of those conceived there – and their thousands of subsequent offspring – have no idea of their true family history and blood ties. Family ties: Barry Stevens with a photograph of his father Bertold Wiesner . Half-brothers: Barry Stevens from Canada, left, and David Gollancz from London, right, were both conceived at the controversial Barton clinic and have discovered that Bertold Wiesner is their biological father . But two men conceived by artificial . insemination at the practice, which operated from the early 1940s until . the mid-1960s, have completed research suggesting up to two-thirds of . sperm donations during that period were by Wiesner. David Gollancz, one of Wiesner’s . biological sons, estimated he would have made 20 donations a year, . meaning he is likely to have fathered between 300 and 600 children. The barrister found out in 1965, at . the age of 12, that he was born from a sperm donor, but was never told . who his biological father was. He finally discovered the truth . through DNA tests and has subsequently made contact with 11 of his . half-siblings, including documentary-maker Barry Stevens, who led . research into the clinic. Mr Gollancz said he had mixed feelings about . his unusual family history. Donor: It is believed that Bertold Wiesner may have fathered up to 600 children through donating sperm at the fertility clinic he founded with his wife Mary Barton in the 1940s . He said: ‘It’s rather uncomfortable, . because artificial insemination was developed on an industrial scale for . cattle and I don’t like the feeling of having been “bred”. ‘But meeting the half siblings that I . have tracked down has been a very life-enriching experience. This does . make it frustrating too, because I know there are all those other . siblings out there who I don’t know but would really like to meet. I’d . love to be able to hire a huge marquee and invite them all to a party.’ Wiesner and Barton’s clinic, based in . London’s Portland Place, is believed to have helped women conceive . around 1,500 babies known as the ‘Barton Brood’. Trent Arsenault, 36, hit the headlines last December after revealing he had fathered 14 children despite being a virgin by donating his sperm to reproductively challenged couples. Mr Arsenault, from Silicon Valley, California, set up a free online sperm bank to help childless couples in situations where he claimed the only other alternative would be sex with a stranger. Speaking on Anderson Cooper's daytime show, he said: '100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that. 'I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin, except I'll have 15 plus kids.' He told Huffington Post: ‘I'm helping people in need... I'm not running a business here.' The high fees meant most of their clients were middle-class, but Barton also claimed to have helped many of the upper classes and even some ‘peers of the realm’. The couple used family friends to provide sperm, but a shortage of donors is believed to have led to Wiesner providing the majority. DNA tests were carried out in 2007 on 18 people conceived at the clinic between 1943 and 1962. The tests found that 12 of the group – two-thirds – were Wiesner’s children. Dr Barton told a 1959 government forum on artificial insemination: ‘I matched race, colouring and stature and all donors were drawn from intelligent stock.’ She added: ‘I wouldn’t take a donor unless he was, if anything, a little above average. ‘If you are going to do it [create a child] deliberately, you have got to put the standards rather higher than normal.’ An article the couple wrote in 1945 about their work prompted a peer to denounce their activities in the House of Lords as ‘the work  of Beelzebub’. Geoffrey Fisher, then Archbishop of Canterbury, also demanded the closure of the clinic. Austrian-born Wiesner died in 1972, aged 70. His wife died 11 years ago. Mr Gollancz was involved in a campaign to stop sperm donors being anonymous, but said he still wanted further changes in the law. He said: ‘I would like to see birth certificates also carrying the name of the sperm or egg donor. ‘Most recipient parents don’t tell their children they are conceived this way, meaning they would never know to search for a donor father. ‘People have a right to know about their own history.’","Bertold Wiesner set up the controversial London Barton clinic with his wife Mary Bartons in the 1940s .

"Emily Thornberry’s Islington home is at the heart of the liberal elite’s dinner party circuit. Directly next door is Margaret Hodge, who is expected to seek Labour’s nomination to be the next London Mayor. Ms Thornberry's home is a vast, four-storey Victorian townhouse in an area beloved of lawyers and bankers, where a similar property changed hands earlier this year for £2.9 million - £900,000 above the threshold for Labour’s planned ‘soak-the-rich’ mansion tax. Hodge’s likely rival, Tessa Jowell, lives a couple of miles north. If Ms Thornberry ever needs to consult Tom Baldwin, one of Ed Miliband’s key advisers, he is only a short stroll away. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband can be found two miles away in a £2.6million townhouse, not far from his staunch supporter and former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Notorious Number 10 spin doctor Alastair Campbell has himself a £2million property within walking distance, while Miliband’s adviser Stewart Wood is not far away either. Others nearby include Ed’s brother David, Lord Falconer, Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. Ms Thornberry shares her home with Oxbridge educated lawyer husband Sir Christopher, a barrister at Wilberforce Chambers whose specialities included the lucrative  field of off-shore trusts (which, among other things, help rich people avoid taxes). The pair bought the property in 1993, two years after they married, and moved in during the same week as another great Islingtonian power couple, Tony and Cherie Blair. Ms Thornberry, a close Ed Miliband ally and one of the first to back him as leader in his battle against brother David, stepped down from her post as Shadow Attorney General two days ago. The resignation came after she was confronted by a 'furious' Ed following her tweet of a house in Rochester flying three England flags from the upstairs windows, with a white van parked in the driveway. Where the other half live: Emily Thornberry and her QC husband moved into the elite  neighbourhood at the same time as Tony and Cherie Blair . She was branded a snob and attacked for her subsequent comments to Mail Online that she had 'never seen anything like it', after which she protested that she had become a victim of anti-Islington prejudice. Dane Ware, the owner of the house which is worth £119,000, has insisted that Ms Thornberry apologise to him over her remarks, but she has so far ducked any meeting with him. The comments have caused a meltdown in the upper echelons of the Labour party, with one MP branding the gaffe 'horrendous, while others turned on Mr Miliband, saying his reaction had been hasty and ill thought-out. Labour strategists had hoped a Ukip landslide in Rochester would mark the moment that pressure switched on to Mr Cameron and away from Mr Miliband, who has endured weeks of speculation about his leadership. But with Ukip’s win narrower than expected, a result likely to deter further potential defectors who want to keep their Commons seats after next May’ s election, there was little sign of Tory disunity. Instead, Labour was riven over whether Mr Miliband’s treatment of Miss Thornberry had been over the top and how it should counter the threat to its working-class vote from Ukip.","Emily Thornberry lives in £3million Islington home with Oxbridge educated lawyer husband Sir Christopher Nugee .

"Getting your own place and moving out from Mum and Dad is every teenager’s dream, but property savvy young Australians have worked out that it’s much better financially to stick with their parents until they're 30 if they want to buy their ideal home. Today young people all over Australia are happy to live with their parents for as long as possible if it means they can afford to buy the property they want in the right area. Graham Mirabito of RP Data – the largest provider of property information, analytics and property-related risk management services in Australia and New Zealand – confirmed that many young adults and couples were prepared to stay at home until they were 30 and do things differently. Young Australians are happy to stay at home with their parents before splashing out on a trendy pad . ‘What we’re hearing from the mortgage brokers is that young people today are buying an investment home in an area they’d like to live in, but for the first few years they'll rent it out and let someone else pay for it, while they remain living at home,’ Mirabito explained. ‘It means they are never priced out of that market and they can move when they can afford to. So what we’re seeing from the mortgage brokers is that young couples are happy to buy an investment property but still live with Mum and Dad. ‘Kids are a lot smarter with their money than what we give them credit for today. It’s a new trend to live at home until you’re 30 because there’s no stigma attached to it now. It’s a sensible business decision.’ Mum and Dad could be seeing much more of their children in the future . Many couples are from Chinese, Italian and Greek ancestry where living together as an extended family well into their 20s is traditional. But it also now makes a lot of financial sense. ‘Young couples buy an investment property and let it tick over, then when they do get married they can move in themselves or sell it to get an even better property in that area,’ Mirabito said. He argued that this new way of thinking caught some developers out in recent years. ‘Developers were building dairy farms in the country into attractive housing lots when the kids looking for places just wanted to live in the city. For 10 years the developers got it wrong to an extent, because the lots were not being bought up as fast as developers thought they would be,’ Mirabito said. A house in this row in Newtown in Sydney would appeal to many first-time home owners . Terraced houses like the ones here at Bourke Street, Surry Hills in Sydney are much sought after . He also believed that the change of thinking was as much cultural as anything else. Decades ago Australians used to get married in their early 20s. Their kids had grown up by the time they were in their 30s. They’d live in the suburbs until the kids had flown the nest and then move back into the city. ‘That has all changed. Young people today want to live in the city to start with and have babies later in life,’ said Mirabito. ‘They’ll then bring their kids up in the early years in their city apartment. It’s later on when the kids get older that they’ll move out to the burbs where they can kick the football around.’ Staying at home longer will help young people save more money to buy their ideal home . CoreLogic RP Data’s quarterly review on the Australian residential property market and economy highlighted other reasons why this new phenomenon was taking place. At the moment first home buyers languish at near record low levels. In September first home buyers accounted for just 12 per cent of all financial housing commitments over the month. The main reason for this is because since early 2010 temporary first home buyer incentives were removed. Over a 12-month period to September 2014 there were 77,854 commitments by first home buyers which were just 12.5 per cent of all commitments and the lowest annual figure on record. Houses like these overlooking North Bondi Beach in Sydney will not come cheaply . It all means that the lack of affordable housing available for Australian first home buyers, particularly within the major capital cities, is what’s likely to be contributing to the low number of first home buyers despite historically low mortgage rates. Young Australians will stay at home first before making a bid on the house of their dreams . The mortgage rates are at near record low levels, because interest rates are at extremely low levels. However, the trouble is that although mortgage rates are low and home values are increasing, household disposal incomes are hardly rising at all.","Young Australians happy to live with parents until finding the right place .

"A woman who launched a Twitter rant over an unpaid £150 bill is facing a libel battle that could cost her £100,000. Lesley Kemp, 55, took to Twitter in a fit of rage alleging that a Middle Eastern company called Resolution Production failed to pay promptly for some transcription work. The typist claims the TV production and equipment hire company took two months to pay her modest fee before docking £25 for 'bank costs'. Twitter libel case: Lesley Kemp, 55, is being sued after Tweeting about a Middle Eastern company which was late paying a bill for typing services . Grandmother Mrs Kemp singled out Resolution Production boss Kirby Kearns by including his username. She also tweeted pleas to Alan Sugar, Theo Paphitis and Duncan Bannatyne in a bid to name and shame the company for what she believed was their lack of professionalism. But the mother-of-two was then hit with a claim form from Mr Kearns’ solicitors saying he had lodged a libel action against her over the allegation for up to a value of £50,000. Mrs Kemp, of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has taken legal advice and been told she could face £100,000 legal fees if she loses the claim. The claim was issued by the company last November and Mrs Kemp received it early this year. Her defence team are preparing for a possible two-day trial later this year. The case is the latest in a series of . libel cases to go before the courts. The speaker's wife Sally Bercow is . currently being sued by Lord McAlpine over a Tweet he claims was . linking him to false child abuse allegations. Mrs . Kemp will be represented by barrister Jonathan Price and libel lawyer . Robert Dougans who successfully defended another landmark libel case. Mr Dougans described the case as a 'Twitter flame war' and said it should not end up before the High Court. 'There is something wrong with the . law. If you have your leg run over by a bus that will be a case in the . small claims court. If we have a fist fight in the pub and we shook . hands afterwards we will be up before a magistrates' court,' he said. Battle: grandmother Mrs Kemp is being supported by the Libel Reform Campaign group and a leading lawyer . 'Libel is a High Court matter - in criminal cases it has to be rape, robbery or murder before you are up before a High Court judge. 'The idea that a Twitter flame ear ends up in the court that is a joke - but that is the law.' The Libel Reform Campaign are supporting Mrs Kemp and well-wishers have donated £2,000 to pay her initial court fees to lodge a defence. Mr Dougans said with a mortgage to pay she faces financial ruin if she loses the case. Mrs Kemp said: 'It was only a small amount of money that we argued over but because I was broke and stressed I took to Twitter and went on a bit of a rant. 'There were a lot of e-mails between us before I took to Twitter. 'He said that I was damaging his reputation and that it was all done maliciously. 'As soon as I received the lawyer's letter I panicked that they were going to really clobber me with this. 'I am not used to freelance work and didn't understand there is a culture of late payments and its not uncommon to have to wait months to receive your fee.' Mrs Kemp says she plans to fight the libel claim the whole way. She added: 'I'm a bit feisty and very determined and if I'm going down then I'm going to come up with a bang. 'I can't even begin to describe the stress that it has put me under.' Mr Dougans represented journalist Simon Singh in his successful libel battle against the British Chiropractic Association in 2010. Singh was sued by the BCA for a piece he wrote in the Guardian's comment pages and the case became a free speech cause celebre. Scientists, celebrities and campaigners lined up to condemn the British libel laws and argue that Singh had a right to express his opinion in print.","Typist Lesley Kemp took to Twitter after company failed to pay bill quickly .

On Thursday night, Autumn Erhard of Laguna Niguel started her turn as a spinner of the big wheel with at least a little more luck than most: She’s 30 years old, it was the shows 30th anniversary, and it was May 30th. But until May 30, only one of the show’s thousands of contestants since 1983 has ever successfully taken home such a huge sum. Scroll down for video . Fortunate: Autumn Erhard became the second person to ever win a one million dollars on Wheel of Fortune on May 30 . Why so rare? Quite a bit of luck goes in to taking home the Wheel of Fortune gold. First, the contestant must be have the good fortune of landing on the million dollar prize wedge during game play and then correctly answer the subsequent question. If they do, they get to hold on to the wedge. In this case, Erhard’s parents and fiancé did the honors. If the player makes it through the rest of the game without hitting the ‘bankrupt’ wheel wedge and then beats the other two contestants to go on to the bonus round, then the usual $100,000 grand prize is replaced with the million dollar wedge. Serendipity: Erhard's big historic win came during the long-running game show's 30th anniversary season . Historic: Erhard, seen here is her family wishing her luck and holding the game piece that let her spin for a million dollars, beat all odds to become only the second million dollar winner in Wheel of Fortune history . Erhard made it that far. She spun the bonus wheel and took an as yet unopened envelope--her future prize. But it didn’t look like it was going to be hers at first. She was left with only four letters revealed to help her solve the final puzzle. That was even after she used a bonus letter she'd picked up over the course of the regular game. 'This looks challenging,' said longtime host Pat Sajak, before encouraging Erhard. 'Talk it out, you're a good player, you never know.' But Erhard didn't need the encouragement. Nor did she need to talk it out, as most contestants do in the final round. In what feels like half a second, Erhard spits out her answer. 'Tough workout,' she said. Vanna threw up her hands in astonishment and Sajak squawked 'WHAT!' and when the letter board lit up, she knew she'd won the game with impressive ease. With a big smile, she waited as Sajak opened her prize envelope to reveal the largest cash prize the game has to offer. 'We have a million dollar winner,' Sajak said, showing the envelope's glittering contents to the camera and audience. Early wedding gift: Erhard (right), a UC San Diego graduate recently became engaged to fiance Joey Penna (right) recently got engaged . Great timing: Fiance Joey, right, works in construction--an industry hit hard by the global recession--but things will certainly be looking up for the couple after Autumn's big win . Happy couple: The couple's wedding is scheduled for July 2014, though they they already received the biggest gift they could possibly expect . The impressive feat was followed by a much deserved exaltation from Erhard and her thrilled family, including fiancé Joey. ‘No one could believe it,’ Erhard told WBMA of the big moment just before her family realized what had happened. ‘They were just off stage and couldn't see what my prize was. They were celebrating the fact that I solved the puzzle. They kept asking me how much I won, and I had to keep repeating it because no one believed me at first.’ The million dollar wedge was added to . the bonus wheel in 2008. The first, and only other million dollar winner . was Michelle Lowenstein in October of that year. Domination: Erhard dominated throughout the game. Compared to her winnings, her competitors took home pennies: one got $2,000 while the other won $1000 . Holder her breath: Erhard nearly blew it when only four letters showed up to help her solve the final puzzle . Amazing: Erhard solved the puzzle, 'Tough Workout' with only four letters and 'thing' as a clue, so quickly even game show veteran Vanna White could hardly believe it . Lowenstein had just gotten home from her honeymoon in 2008 when she was told she would be taping the show. 'I got home from my honeymoon on a Monday,' she told the New York Post. 'They called me on Wednesday and I taped the show that Friday.' The New Jersey native was living in California with her new husband when she became the show's first millionaire. She and her husband met while working at a New Jersey Cheesecake Factory restaurant. WATCH THE FIRST MILLION DOLLAR WINNER . Her winning phrase was 'Leaky Faucet.' Asked what she would do with all the dough, the then 24-year-old said she'd like to buy a car. 'And I'll help out my parents and my sister,' she said. Lowenstein’s takehome of $1,026,080 in . cash and prizes remained the highest in Wheel of Fortune history until . now. Her record has now been bested by Erhard’s $1,030,340 in cash . prizes, including trips to Belize and Arizona. Beaten expectations: 'I am in complete and utter shock,' said Erhard, who'd gone on the show just hoping to solve a few puzzles and earn money for her upcoming wedding . Erhard is a sales representative for a veterinary pharmaceutical company and her fiancé works in construction. No word yet on how they’ll spend the money, by Erhard is likely still just trying to calm down from the initial thrill. ‘I wanted to have some fun and solve some puzzles, she said. 'I feel like I'm in a dream!’ Erhard said that, prior to the show, she was hoping to win some money to put towards her upcoming wedding. She certainly did that. 'I am in complete and utter shock,' she said. Unbelievable: As her family gathered, Erhard said they were unaware how lucky she was, 'They were celebrating the fact that I solved the puzzle. They kept asking me how much I won'","With just two T’s, an R, and a G, she miraculously comes up with 'Tough Workout' to solve the .

"An end of terrace home in London is set to become the most expensive property ever sold in the UK after it went on the market for £250million. The six-storey Grade I listed Regency mansion is a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace and boasts 50,000 sq ft of living space, making it one of the capital’s largest private homes. On sale: This house in St James's has apparently gone on the market with an asking price of £250million . Luxury: Carlton House Terrace, pictured, is an exclusive street with few residential properties . Central: The house is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus . Reports yesterday suggested that a ‘strictly confidential’ brochure, . which describes 18 Carlton House Terrace as ‘probably the finest . residence in London’, has been circulating among the super-wealthy. For security reasons it shows only black and white photographs from the . 1890s. Details on the interior are sketchy, but there is believed to be a . magnificent double staircase and a huge ballroom. Spacious: The living space inside number 18 is nearly as large as a whole football pitch . Inside: This vintage picture shows how the £250million house looked under a previous owner . Private: The current owner has not allowed any up-to-date pictures of the interior to be published . The house is . registered in the British Virgin Islands and is said to be owned by a . member of a Middle East royal family. Property expert Henry Pryor, who pointed out that the ‘nearest corner . shop will be Fortnum & Mason’, said: ‘I think it will almost . certainly be bought by a foreign buyer.’ View: One expert has suggested that the house's value could be reduced by its location among businesses . Terrace: Regency townhouses in London have become increasingly unaffordable in recent years . Passing by: Carlton House Terrace is considered desirable thanks to its location just off The Mall . If . 18 Carlton House Terrace reaches its £250million asking price, it will . be the UK's most expensive home - but it is not the only super-pricey . property to reach the market in the past year. Last autumn, a huge house at . Rutland Gate overlooking Hyde Park was put on sale for £300million, . although its price was slashed when it failed to find a buyer. Around the same time, 1 Cornwall . Terrace, opposite Regent's Park, was advertised for £100million, which . estate agents said was the highest price ever asked for a terraced . house. Outside Central London, Heath Hall in Hampstead was also marketed at £100million - which later had to be lowered to £65million. Cambridge House on Piccadilly, . formerly home to the In and Out Club, is currently being renovated and . could fetch more than £200million when it is sold. The property is 1,537 times more expensive than the average house sold . last month in the UK, which was worth £162,606. At the asking price, the . buyer will face a £17.5million bill for stamp duty. Details on the property's interior are sketchy, it is believed to boast a magnificent double staircase and huge ballroom. The secret brochure apparently shows interior photographs which were taken in the 1890s, because the current owner does not want to advertise the contents of his home for security reasons. The property is registered in the British Virgin Islands, and said to be owned by a member of the Saudi royal family. Despite the shaky economic recovery, 2012 was a record year for sales in London worth more than £5million, according to research by estate agent Savills. Last year, more than 400 properties were sold over that threshold, up from 350 in 2011. With so many properties now . fetching nine-figure sums, oligarchs might be tempted to move to .

"This is an unusual moment when an elderly man crossed paths with one of the world's deadliest snakes and casually kicks it out of the way on a beachside walk. The footage captures an Australian man, whose identity is unknown, strolling along a picnic area, believed to be at The Surf Club Nobby's Beach in Queensland.

"Deanna Blegg never backs down from a challenge. Over the years the Australian has competed in both individual and team adventure races at the elite level all over the world. But none of these exhausting endurance tests compare to an even bigger battle – her fight with HIV. It was while travelling through Britain at the age of 24 that she found out she'd contracted it. In an interview with The Age last year Deanna said the prognosis was the worst it could possibly be. Deanna Blegg's battle with HIV has driven her on to greater things . She was given only five years to live. Feeling devastated and a long, long way from home, all she felt was a sense of shame and isolation. ‘The shame stayed with me for so long. I contracted HIV from my boyfriend and yet I felt shameful for it. What is shameful about having a boyfriend and a sexual relationship? Because HIV was a part of it, it left me with this disgusting shameful feeling,' she said. Thankfully for Deanna the future was not as bad as was predicted. Her life was saved by the advent of HIV drugs, and from here on she vowed to make use of every day. Deanna represented Australia in the World’s Toughest Mudder competition . Her miraculous tale continued last week when she beat hundreds of men for the chance to compete in one of the toughest physical challenges on earth. On November 15, Deanna represented Australia in the World’s Toughest Mudder (WTM) – a 24-hour non-stop obstacle course in Las Vegas. The 45-year-old mother of two was the only woman in the Australian team of four, and had competed against hundreds of men and women to earn her spot on the team. An amazing 800 people pulled out in the course of the race, but not Deanna. The WTM is designed to push Mudders to their physical and mental limits. The endurance test is an eight kilometre loop course in the Desert of Las Vegas, Nevada, with 29 obstacles per lap. As Mamamia.com reported, it was nothing she couldn't handle. In the Tough Mudder the aim is to run as many laps as possible. In addition to the obstacles, competitors also battle with the elements. Everything from sandstorms with winds of over 100 km-an-hour whipping the runners' faces with sand, to a wind chill factor that can get down to as low as minus five degrees at night, were just a few of the hardships she had to endure. The 45-year-old mother of two was the only woman in the Australian team of four . ‘Obstacle racing attracts an incredible amount of women. Sometimes the women outnumber the men. It is a sport where for most the pressure is off and they can go around the course in a group of friends. I love the sport for that reason,’ she told Mamamia.com. After what she has been through in her personal life it would also be safe to say that she loves life in general every single day too. And it's her memories of those darks times in 1994 when she was first diagnosed with HIV that keeps driving her on. ‘Every woman feels shame, disgust, anger, dirty, damaged, fearful, loss, regret, despair, shock and most importantly we feel alone,’ Blegg said about discovering she had HIV. ''Whether a woman chooses to share her HIV diagnosis with others or not… there will always be a sense of being alone.' Deanna celebrates with the Australia team after finishing the World’s Toughest Mudder competition . Now as well as her family, the athletic community from around the world will make sure she never feels that alone again. 800 people pulled out of the 24-hour non-stop obstacle course in Las Vegas, but not Deanna .","Superfit Blegg's world fell apart when she was diagnosed with HIV in 1994 .

"Gerard Depardieu has revealed he was once a rent boy and a petty thief who served three weeks in prison for stealing a car . He is regarded as one of the most prolific and talented character actors to grace the screen and it appears his ability to adapt to any role given can be traced back to his childhood. Gerard Depardieu has revealed he was once a rent boy, a petty thief who served three weeks in prison for stealing a car and also turned his hand to grave robbing before being saved from destitution by a gay theatre talent spotter who paid for him to study French drama. The 65-year-old award-winning actor makes his confessions confessions in his autobiography, called 'it happened like that' (Ca c'est fait comme ca) in which he also tells of his unexpected friendship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president and the death of his son Guillaume in 2008. Depardieu, who became a household name in Britain for his role in the 1990 romantic comedy Green Card alongside Andie MacDowell, reveals as a toddler he became accustomed to hearing his mother tell him about her attempts to abort him using knitting needles adding: 'And to think I almost killed you.' His family was so poor that as a child he helped deliver his siblings as his parents could not afford a midwife. Depardieu writes he began to wander the streets when he was just 10 but could easily pass for being 15 - and quickly realised he was attractive to men. He said: 'I've known since I was very young that I please homosexuals' and added when men approached, asking for sex, 'I would ask them for money'. He also admits he occasionally helped a man to dig up newly buried bodies in the cemetery and steal jewellery and shoes from them. At 16, he served three weeks in prison for stealing a car but continued his career as a rent boy after moving from Châteauroux, in central France, where he grew up, to Paris. Occasionally he would mug his clients. 'At 20, the thug in me was alive and kicking,' he writes. 'I would rip some of them off. I would beat up some bloke and leave with all his money.' Scroll down for video . The actor became a household name in Britain for his role in the 1990 romantic comedy Green Card and his performance in Cyrano de Bergerac . He also describes stealing watches and money from students taking part in the May 1968 anti-government protests, picking their pockets as they slept on the street in between skirmishes with police. At one point he also routinely charmed his way into a Nato base where he bought cigarettes to sell for twice what he had paid. Describing himself as a 'rough-hewn peasant' he eventually married actress Elisabeth Guignot, who is from a well-off Parisian family and they had two children, Guillaume and Julie. He had two more with two other women: but family life and the role of father is not one that Depardieu plays well. When his children have complained about being associated with him he writes he has told them: 'What do you want? Change your name, for heaven's sake, if it bothers you.' The confessions of the Cyrano de Bergerac star also shed new light on the tragic life of Guillaume who was also an actor. He also admitted to working as a rent boy when he was broke and he served two prison sentences for theft and drugs. He died of viral pneumonia in 2008, aged 37. He also describes stealing watches and money from students  in the May 1968 anti-government protests . Depardieu blames his inability to tell his children he loved them on his father Dede, a metalworker and volunteer fireman who said very little. 'I could never find the words,' he writes. 'I know how to speak the words of others, but when it comes to my own, I am the son of Dédé.' Depardieu, a drinker and gourmet, is well known for rumbustious behaviour. He has crashed his scooter when drunk, attacked photographers and outraged fellow aircraft passengers by urinating in the aisle. The actor recently boasted of drinking 14 bottles a day, starting with champagne in the morning and ending with whisky at night. He claims his drinking is not a sign he is an alcoholic but a man hounded by phobias: 'I'm obsessed with the racket in my body, the beating of my heart, the gurgling of my intestines, my joints cracking,' he writes. 'It's become a phobia to the point that if I'm alone in a hotel I must drink so as not to hear it, so as not to go mad from it. I can't get to sleep unless I am dead drunk.' He has little patience for the Socialist government of President François Hollande whom he blamed for leaving France in a 'filthy mess'. He fled the country last year for Belgium and Russia, where he became a citizen, to avoid paying what he said was an 87% tax bill. 'Are you happy now?' he claims to have bellowed down the phone at Hollande after telling him he was leaving. Depardieu also tells of his friendship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. They first met in 2008 and immediately hit it off, recognising they had much in common. 'We could have both become hoodlums,' he writes. 'I think he immediately liked my hooligan side ... the fact that I had occasionally been picked up off the pavement dead drunk. 'Like with me, nobody would have betted a penny on him when he was 15.' Depardieu reveals he regularly writes to Putin: 'It's very easy', he explains, 'I speak, there's a guy who taps it out in French then translates it into Russian and it arrives on Putin's desk. I send him letters that tell him about everything. He's like an old chum. It amuses him and he replies.'","Gerard Depardieu revealed he was a rent boy and mugged some clients .

"The grieving families of Britons who died overseas have hit out at the incompetence and insensitivity of Foreign Office staff employed to help them. They have accused consular officials of being uncaring and unhelpful – and even of failing to dress appropriately – making their heartache even more traumatic. The damning criticisms come in a report by a cross-party panel of MPs which ordered the Foreign Office to improve its services to bereaved families. MPs also demanded an inquiry into claims some torture victims were failed by consular staff. The grieving families of Britons who died overseas have hit out at the incompetence and insensitivity of Foreign Office staff employed to help them; pictured is the Foreign  and Commonwealth Office in Whitehall . Despite being ‘tested’ in recent years by people getting into trouble when taking more ‘adventurous’ holidays, and by other crises, the service has cut its staff by more than half. And in a hard-hitting report, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee warned the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) ‘not to dehumanise and minimise the service’ in the pursuit of ‘excessive cost-cutting’. MPs also raised concerns over the lack of British staff among consul employees as more than 90 per cent of those jobs are now filled by local staff. The Committee revealed how some families dealing with the tragic death of loved ones abroad felt ‘entirely let down’ by consuls. Karen Walchester, whose son was found dead in Tenerife, told MPs there was ‘no one to take responsibility for care of a broken-hearted family trying to muddle through a chaotic system whilst in terrible grief and confusion. The FCO say they are helping the family when someone dies abroad, but most of what they do can be found on the internet’. MPs concluded there was ‘substantial anecdotal evidence’ that the consular service had at times ‘fallen well below the expected standards’ – including repeated failures of communication and compassion . The family of a teacher murdered in Havana in March 2012 told MPs that the handling of their tragedy had been ‘wholly incompetent’. They said: ‘We had an expectation that in such a time of crisis there would be an infrastructure of solid support, with efficient, robust consular assistance. This was not the case. The FCO added significantly to the trauma and confusion.’ A witness to the Committee, whose partner died in a plane crash in Nepal, spoke about flying out to visit the crash site only to find embassy staff were waiting dressed in shorts and T-shirts. MPs concluded there was ‘substantial anecdotal evidence’ that the consular service had at times ‘fallen well below the expected standards’ – including repeated failures of communication and compassion. Official consular guidance to families affected by the murder of a relative overseas was also branded ‘timid’. MPs also called for a specific investigation into claims some consular staff failed to offer their full protection to torture victims. They heard claims that FCO officials in Dubai had failed to take a proper record of one Briton’s injuries, ‘had not been sympathetic or compassionate’ and did not apply diplomatic pressure until his friends took their story to the press. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Some of the issues the Committee has identified, including our response to murders abroad, are areas that we are already working to improve.’","Foreign Office ordered to improve its services to victim's families .

"A Boston couple with three children have pleaded guilty to the mistreatment of an immigrant they illegally smuggled into the U.S. to work around-the-clock as their housekeeper and nanny, paying her just $2,500 for 13 years of servitude. At a federal court hearing in Boston on Wednesday, Martha Smalanskas, 48, and Richard Smalanskas, 49, who live in Harvard, Massachusetts, admitted to paying the victim at times just $35 a month, with authorities determining the family owed her roughly $301,000 under prevailing minimum wage - $298,500 less than what she actually earned. The victim worked for the family from 1997 to 2011 - a total of 13 years and four months. As a result, the couple will be forced to pay the woman - who was not identified but is believed to be about 35-years-old - $150,000 in restitution and serve a year of probation, under an agreement they reached with prosecutors, according to The Boston Globe. Scene: The victim worked and lived in this house in Harvard, Massachusetts, for 13 years and four months, earning just $2500 the entire time. Her jobs including cleaning, cooking, caring for three children and even shoveling snow, the prosecution said . A charge of harboring an illegal immigrant, which carries a punishment of up to 10 years in prison, will be dismissed. The pair will be sentenced on April 2 after pleading guilty to charges of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. The case started when the couple hired the Bolivian woman as a nanny when she was 16. The family were living in Bolivia at the time. After three years, they brought her to the United States by falsifying documents to make it appear she was a relative. Once in the country, they took away and her travel documents and forced her to work from 6am to 8pm, six days a week. That's 84 hours a week and 336 hours a month. Among the victims duties were cooking, cleaning, caring for three children and even shoveling snow. She earned around $4 a week for 84 hours work. This is a stock image . The family had originally promised her $100 a month. Prosecutors determined they ended up paying the victim as little as $35 dollars a month, which is less than 10 cents an hour. Earning $2500 for 13 years work - as the prosecution said - works out to be $192 a year and $16 a month. Thats $4 a week and less than one cent an hour. As part of her job she cooked, cleaned, cared for the children and even shoveled snow. She had Sundays off and was occasionally allowed to early on Saturdays. The victim was removed from the home for unknown reasons in May 2011. Her current circumstances are also unknown.","Martha Smalanskas, 48, and Richard Smalanskas, 49, from Harvard, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to violating the Fair Labor Standards Act at a federal court hearing in Boston on Wednesday .

"This angry gorilla was clearly feeling camera shy. The ape was filmed throwing a rock at a group of Irish tourists when they tried to take a video of him at Berlin Zoo.

They filmed the 'impressive' animal on their phone as he walked down the slope towards them. One member of the group is then heard saying that 'gorillas are meant to be really aggressive' as they move to get a better view of the animal after he walked behind a bush. As the men continue to talk among themselves, the animal picks up a rock from the ground and throws it towards the group. The animal is then seen standing on its hind legs - apparently judging whether he hit his target. The camera jolts as Mr Nolan moves to avoid the missile - which was launched with such force that it is not caught on film.

"One father and daughter have found a very unique way of going into business with one another. Jeffrey and Meika Hollender, the founders of Sustain, are currently marketing and selling the first 'sustainable Fair Trade brand of condoms.' And to think some girls find it difficult to even talk about the birds and the bees with their father. Daddy's little girl: Meika Hollender (above) started a line of sustainable condoms with her father, called Sustain . Proud papa: 'The fact that Meika and I work together selling a product that has to do with sex is really a model for the kind of openness we should have in our society,' says Jeffrey . 'The fact that Meika and I work together selling a product that has to do with sex is really a model for the kind of openness we should have in our society,' Jeffrey tells the Daily News. His daughter seems to feel the same, adding, 'When an uncomfortable moment comes up, I laugh it off — it might end up in my next blog post.' The line uses latex taken from a sustainable rubber plantation in India that bans child labor and is environmentally sound. What's more, that plantation provides 180 workers a living wage and gives free medical care and education to workers’ families. 'The amazing thing about this incredibly small product is how many benefits it has for our society and the planet,' explains Jeffrey. How it works: The condoms are made from latex farmed at an environmentally sound plantation in India . Marketing: The two admit they do not however discuss condom specifics, just the sustainability of the latex . Making the father-daughter work relationship somewhat easier is also the fact that condom specifics, like size and reservoir caps and lubrication, are left to the experts to decide upon, not the Hollenders. 'There are certain things that are off limits for discussion,' says Jeffrey. 'Which I think is appropriate.'","Jeffrey and Meika Hollender, the founders of Sustain, are currently marketing and selling the first 'sustainable Fair Trade brand of condoms'

"Police are demanding to be allowed to patrol in pairs because they fear fanatics are planning to murder an officer on the street – in a horrific echo of the killing of soldier Lee Rigby last year. Frontline officers in London feel increasingly at risk as they take to the streets by themselves in cars or on the beat because of the danger of a jihadi attack. Some also want the right to carry protective equipment such as CS spray and batons when they go off-duty, over concerns they could be targeted as they leave stations at night. Senior figures in the Police Federation have met counter-terror chiefs to voice their members’ fears after alleged terrorists were accused of plotting to shoot officers after carrying out surveillance of their station. Police are demanding to be allowed to patrol in pairs because they fear fanatics are planning to murder an officer on the street – in a horrific echo of the killing of soldier Lee Rigby last year . But chiefs have refused requests to increase protection and are calling on officers to be more vigilant in the face of higher risk levels. In a further sign of the heightened security situation in Britain, the first ‘counter-terrorism awareness week’ will be launched tomorrow with more police on duty at shopping centres and airports as well as providing advice on how the public can spot potential radicals. Former Scotland Yard detective Chris Hobbs told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘Frontline police officers in London are fearful they could become victims of savage targeted attacks on the streets of the capital by fanatical Islamist jihadists. Officers are concerned that other than receiving “stay vigilant” advice they are not being kept fully informed of events in relation to the very real threats to their own safety or being afforded additional protection.’ Fusilier Rigby was hacked to death near Woolwich Barracks in south-east London on May 22 last year . It was standard practice for police to go on the beat in pairs but in recent years chiefs have changed to single crewing as budget cuts have led to the loss of 15,000 jobs since the last Election. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: ‘Officer safety is of utmost importance and the position will remain under constant review.’","Officers in London feel increasingly at risk from attacks by jihadis .

"An elderly dairy farmer threw himself under a train after being pushed to breaking point by the stress of modern farming and fears he might lose his livelihood, an inquest heard. Herbert John Michael Batkin, 73, died from catastrophic injuries after being dragged half a mile down railway lines by a speeding train on August 1. The grandad-of-13 - known to his family as Mike - was found  near to Prees Railway Station in Shropshire, close to where he lived. Herbert John Michael Batkin, 73, a grandfather-of-thirteen, died of catastrophic injuries after being dragged half a mile down railway lines after throwing himself in front of a train on August 1 . An inquest heard the experienced farmer was struggling to cope with mounting financial worries and fears he might lose his livelihood. Just two days before his death police confiscated guns from his home in Prees after doctors raised concerns about his depressed mental state. On Friday John Ellery, coroner for Shropshire and Telford & Wrekin, recorded a verdict of suicide. Although semi-retired, Mr Batkin was still carrying out day-to-day tasks on the farm including milking the cows. Dr Martin Sullivan, who had seen the farmer just days before he died, said in a statement Mr Batkin had asked for more sleeping pills as he was worried about the farm. Dr Sullivan said: 'He had a long history of depression and noted stress with farming. 'He explained he wrote a note in case anything happened to him, the implication being that he might try to harm himself. 'He said the note was just in case and he had written it a while ago. I explained I needed to contact the police to remove his firearms. 'I called the police and arranged for the guns to be removed and I called the crisis team and asked them to support him.' He said Mr Batkin was planning the future and agreed to go back for a review in one week. His wife, Dorothy, told the inquest that she heard her husband get up at around 2am, which was not unusual, but never heard him return. Mr Batkin's son, Kevin, said: 'Farming was just one of his worries. It is a stressful job. 'The industry is under quite a lot of pressure business-wise and the hours we have to do are long. You can't just switch off and you don't finish at 5pm. Mr Badkin, who was known to his family as Mike, had been suffering from depression over fears he might lose his livelihood, and had his guns taken away after doctors feared for his mental state . 'He had not suffered from depression for over 15 years but the way the industry is at the minute must have brought it all back. 'Unfortunately, that's the state of modern British farming. More and more farmers and being left helpless and increasingly losing their farms. 'They just can't compete with big supermarkets and producers slashing milk prices like they have.' The tragedy happened the same day senior figures in the agricultural industry warned farmers are under huge pressure, with many going bankrupt. The Farming Community Network said farmers are facing a mixture of problems including bovine TB, volatile milk prices and extreme weather. Charles Smith, chief executive, added 'It is a big problem. Farmers' tough breeding means they could be more reluctant to talk about their worries for fear of appearing weak.' Last month hundreds of farmers staged a protest over milk prices outside Muller Wiseman - one of the UK's largest dairies. It came over fears they would be put out of business after Muller slashed their price of milk by 1.9 pence per litre .","Herbert John Michael Batkin, 73, committed suicide on August 1 .

"Lawyer Maria Bamieh demanded a corruption inquiry into her colleagues at Eulex rule of law mission in Kosovo . When British lawyer Maria Bamieh was given the chance to help rebuild war-torn Kosovo with an elite EU anti-crime and corruption unit three years ago she jumped at the chance. Fifteen years after the conflict, Kosovo remains a lawless region, with gangsters, corrupt politicians and war criminals threatening the integrity of the EU borders. But Bamieh could hardly have known she would soon be demanding a corruption investigation into her own colleagues – or that she would then be escorted out of her office after becoming a whistleblower, and abruptly suspended. Today, six years after taking the job, the 55-year-old says the investigations unit, known as Eulex, failed to pursue her allegations thoroughly and instead chose to ‘punish’ her for speaking out. ‘I have been subject to a campaign of victimisation and my career with Eulex is over. I may well not work again,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘More to the point this affair raises wider questions about what Eulex has achieved over the six years of its existence and at what cost to the EU and the British taxpayer. 'Our money is going into this mission and most of the staff work part-time but get a full-time salary. They disappear on Thursday or Friday morning, fly home and reappear on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning.’ Her worrying story has not only rocked the anti-corruption unit, which has so far swallowed £750million of EU money, but could – if her allegations stick – envelop the EU in a major corruption scandal. There is already an official EU investigation into the affair. Ms Bamieh’s concerns reached a head during an investigation into a senior civil servant at the Kosovan health ministry. The man, Ilir Tolaj, had been arrested and held in prison amid allegations he had demanded bribes from pharmaceutical companies in return for official contracts. He had also smuggled a phone into his cell. Ilir Tolaj was arrested and held in prison amid allegations he had demanded bribes from pharmaceutical companies in return for official contracts . ‘I got a court order to intercept his calls because he was not entitled to have that phone,’ says Ms Bamieh. ‘We monitored the calls.’ And the results, gathered in May and June 2012, were disturbing. It became clear Tolaj was taking calls from people claiming to be intermediaries or go-betweens between Italian judge Francesco Florit, who was seconded to Eulex, and Bamieh’s boss, the Czech chief prosecutor Jaroslava Novotna. The intermediaries told Tolaj that the Italian judge would ‘do everything to help because he thinks that man [Tolaj] deserves to be helped.’ Bamieh was alarmed to find she was herself the subject of these illegal discussions. It was claimed, for example, that the Italian judge, had described Bamieh as ‘very difficult’ and that Florit had suggested he would get Bamieh replaced. Tolaj was allegedly taking calls from people claiming to be intermediaries between Italian judge Francesco Florit (right) and Bamieh’s boss, the Czech chief prosecutor Jaroslava Novotna (left) Another of the middlemen told Tolaj he would hold a meeting with Bamieh’s boss, her ‘chief… the Czech lady’. In one call, Tolaj offers the observation that, ‘I will analyse and see whether I can afford it or not’. The implication was all too clear: two senior colleagues in Eulex could well be compromised, wittingly or otherwise. Florit and Novotna have denied any wrongdoing to The Mail on Sunday. Ms Bamieh continued: ‘I could not investigate or prosecute Novotna or Florit because I cannot be a prosecutor and witness.’ Eventually, she says, despite the concerns she had raised, she realised there was no proper investigation. Her suspicions grew stronger when she was approached by two men convicted of a 2009 bomb attack in the Kosovan capital Pristina amid allegations of a feud between a gangster and a police officer for the hand of a pop singer. It resulted in a fatal explosion. Ms Bamieh claims she was 'victimised' and 'punished' for speaking out as she was suspended and escorted out of Eulex headquarters last month . The two convicted men, it seemed, had made their own approaches to the Italian judge. She said: ‘They told me they had paid money to Florit... and one of the family made a statement how he went to Albania with his lawyer to do negotiations with Florit and they were told that €300,000 was only enough for one of them to be cleared. But when I reported this all that happened was that I got punished. I began to be subject to a series of investigations for trivial offences such as car parking. In reality no one got investigated.’ Eventually she went on Kosovan television to outline her claims. Kosovo broke away from Yugoslavia in 1999 and became a UN protectorate after its bloody war, which pitched the Serb minority against the majority ethnic Albanians. In 2008 the ethnic Albanian-led parliament declared unilateral independence and the UN unit was replaced by Eulex that same year. Ms Bamieh claims she asked for protection because of her role as a whistleblower but when Eulux was downsized she was made redundant. Although reinstated on appeal, she was suspended and escorted out of the Eulex headquarters last month after repeating her allegations. Eulex accused her of leaking documents to the press, a charge Bamieh denies. Now back in London, the mother of one said: ‘I only went to the press after the story came out to clear my name.’ Eulex has announced a fresh investigation but in a sign of Brussels impatience with the unit the EU’s new foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has despatched a lawyer to oversee the investigation. ‘For God’s sake, they need to call a lawyer to say how an anti-corruption unit should deal with corruption!’ she said. ‘They are meant to be a rule of law mission.’ Richard Howitt, Labour MEP for East of England, said he had met senior EU officials about the case. ‘These allegations are credible and very serious,’ he said. ‘The EU has to have zero tolerance to corruption. It is clear the existing investigation is inadequate. It appears it could be a cover-up. Maria Bamieh has been let down badly.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lawyer Maria Bamieh demanded corruption inquiry into her colleagues .

"When it comes to the NYPD, no job is too big or too small. From catching crooks to cats stuck up trees, New York's Finest can handle it all - usually. One cat-capturing-cop responding to a 911 call found himself needing the emergency services too. Here kitty kitty: The stray cat was stuck up a tree in Queens, New York when a passing police officer decided to help out . After school drama: The double cat and cop rescue took place after school outside Public School 213 in Queens, New York . The officer was trying to rescue a stray that had become stranded in a tree in Oakland Park, Queens. After climbing one branch too many, he ended up having to make his own 911 call, this time to the fire department. The officer found himself stuck up the same tree as the cat, just a little further down. The cop was trying to rescue the kitty across the street from Public School 213. New York's Bravest: There are huge rivalries between NYC's fire and police departments. No doubt the cop involved here will be the butt of jokes for weeks to come... Courtesy Professionalism Respect: The NYPDs slogan for the work that it does whether it be capturing criminals or cute kittys . Children at the school made their wishes known to the officer, 'You gotta get the cat! You gotta get the cat!' they begged. 'The cop went up after the cat. The cat went a little further out. So, the cop went further out and he got stuck.' said a source at the NYPD. Leave it to New York's Bravest who arrived with the tools that this job needed from the get-go. An FDNY tower ladder and bucket arrived to scoop up the cop and cat 30 feet up the tree and brought them both back down to earth, without so much as a scratch. The black and white cat appeared to be about a year old and was not wearing a collar, according to neighbour Luna Giuong, 19. Another neighbour Jeff Yu, 22, said students from the nearby school had just finished classes for the day and stopped to stare at the police officer and the cat. 'It was kind of comical,' he said. 'They seemed to be enjoying themselves. There were no rude comments or anything.' The officer had lit a flare and set up cones on the ground underneath the tree before going up but onlookers ignored them as they gathered and gawked from the ground, said Yu. No doubt the officer involved will be preparing to face some ribbing from his colleagues back at the station house - perhaps a job at 'special branch' awaits?","Kids ask cop to rescue stray cat .

"The fiance of Lee Rigby has spoken of her daily battle to block thoughts about the two Islamic extremists who murdered him in the street saying if she has emotions towards them it means they have won. Aimee West was 3,500 miles away in Afghanistan when she learned that the fusilier had been hacked him to death in front of horrified onlookers near Woolwich Barracks in south-east London on May 22 last year. His killers Michael Adebolajo received a whole-life term, while Michael Adebowale, was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years. Scroll down for video . Aimee West pictured with her fiance Lee Rigby before his death. She says that she has a daily battle to block thoughts about the two Islamic extremists who murdered him . Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales and became engaged in 2013 . A Parliamentary report is expected to say that some of the online behaviour by Adebolajo before Fusilier Rigby's death could have pointed to his intentions. Now in a interview with the Telegraph, Miss West, 24, says she doesn't think about the killers as she refuses to let them ruin her memories of her fiance. She told the newspaper: 'I had a lot of therapy after this happened and the one thing that stuck with me was that if I think about them, if I have any emotion towards them - they've won. 'They haven't just killed Lee, they've killed me as well. And I refuse to let them do that. 'It's as if I'm standing on the outside looking in, like everybody else. I've mentally detached myself to be able to cope.' Miss West began a relationship with Mr Rigby in 2012 when they met at an Army Cadets training event in Wales. Miss West, left, has now said she refuses to think about the killers of her fiance, Lee, right . The 25-year-old father-of-one was then estranged from his wife Rebecca, who he had his son Jack with, and was getting a divorce. The following year, before the military police woman flew away for a tour of Afghanistan, he proposed and she accepted. Following Mr Rigby's death, Miss West says she has now quit the Army and has gone back to university, where she is studying to be a lawyer. She also set up the Lee Rigby Fund as part of the Soldiers' Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale who were both convicted of murdering Lee Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks last year . British-born Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car as he was walking towards the barracks wearing a Help for Heroes hoodie, before hacking him to death. They both claimed that they were ‘soldiers of Allah’ and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing, which they called an 'act of war'. Mayhem broke out at the Old Bailey earlier this year as the remorseless killers disrupted proceedings when they were accused of a 'betrayal' of Islam. As he was about to be jailed for life without parole Adebolajo shouted Allahu Akbhar, and Adebowale called out ‘that's a lie’ and ‘it's not a betrayal of Islam’ as the judge told them they had been radicalised. Last week it was revealed that internet service providers did not raise the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in the six months before his death. The companies - who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services - failed to inform authorities about material posted by Michael Adebolajo before the attack he carried out with Michael Adebowale. Floral tributes were left at the scene near Woolwich Barracks where Fusilier Rigby was targeted as he walked along the street wearing a Help for Heroes hoodie . It meant MI5 missed internet messages that could have alerted them to the threat posed by the murderers. A long-awaited report by Parliament’s intelligence watchdog is expected to say Adebolajo was posting extremist material on social media sites in the months leading up to the attack. The messages would have been sufficiently serious to justify the security services – who had had Adebolajo on their radar for eight years – putting him under more detailed surveillance. But officers found out about them only after the sickening murder of the 25-year-old soldier outside Woolwich Barracks in May last year. The report is expected to conclude that officials could not have prevented the attack on the day.","Aimee West says she often has to block thoughts about fiance's killers .

Delicious: Jessica Siskin, a New York-based food artist created the incredible life-like Thanksgiving meal . Talented:  Jessica Siskin, pictured here, has created the incredible life-like plate of food ahead of Thanksgiving . Her one-of-a kind meal is featured on the social media site, Instagram, under the handle Mister Krisp where she sells her incredible art. Her page features dozens of images of  everyday items such as chicken wings and even a bowl of hummus to go with the big meal, all transformed with Rice Krispies. She has even managed to cleverly re-create something to talk about after dinner with the cheeky image of Kim Kardashian's now famous  booty picture featured in Paper Magazine. Siskin said she originally came up with the innovative idea for the treats when she needed to make a dessert for a friend's potluck last fall, and settled on a Rice Krispie Treat. 'I don't know how to cook anything besides Rice Krispie Treats' she tells MailOnline. Each treat that she makes, typically takes between 40 minutes and two hours to make. And she is clear about why she enjoys using   the breakfast cereal in her food art. 'Because everything tastes better when it's made of rice krispie treat...except pizza,' she writes. Booty: She has even managed to cleverly re-create the cheeky image of Kim Kardashian's now famous booty picture featured in Paper Magazine for something to talk about after dinner . Food: Her page features dozens of images of everyday items  and even a bowl of hummus . Hot item: Depending on your taste, these Rice Krispie chicken wings could be a part of the Thanksgiving dinner . Support: Siskin used to work for the Olsen twins, seen here, and said 'They've been so supportive' The talented artist previously worked at Elizabeth and James, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's fashion line. 'They've been so supportive,' she says of the Olsen twins, adding that Elzabeth and James sent Mister Krisp snowmen to the brand's top customers for the holidays. Now, as families across the country prepare for their annual Thanksgiving dinner, Siskin's Rice Krispie version is  enough to set off a whole host of cravings ahead of November 27. It's fortunate that this non-traditional meal is, in fact totally edible.","The meal is the brainchild of Jessica Siskin, a New York-based food artist .

"The son of the pilot of ill-fated MH370 has broken his silence and denied Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately crashed the plane into the Indian Ocean. Ahmad Seth says he has 'ignored all the speculation' around his 53-year-old father since the plane mysteriously disappeared en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur 19 days ago. The 26-year-old, Captain Zaharie's youngest son, says the family has yet to accept the official ruling that all 239 people on board are dead, insisting they will wait for physical evidence, as searches were today suspended when heavy rain, winds and low clouds forced aircraft to return to base. Scroll down for video . Ahmad Seth Zaharie with his sister Aishah Zaharie, left, and their mother, Faizah Khanum Mustafa Khan, says he knows his father 'better' and has ignored all the speculation about his role in the fate of MH370 . The criminal inquiry cleared all the  intelligence checks completed for all the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur. The only individual arousing suspicion was Captian Shah . 'I've read everything online. But I've ignored all the speculation,' he told the New Strait Times. 'We may not be as close as he travels so much. But I understand him. 'Now, we are just waiting for the right confirmation. I will believe it when I see the proof in front of my eyes.' The Times added that Mr Seth was supported at the family home by friends. His mother Khanum Mustafa Khan and siblings Ahmad Idris and Aishah - who lives in Melbourne - have not spoken to media since the plane disappeared. It comes amid reports that investigators now believe Captain Zaharie is solely responsible for the Malaysian Airline jet's demise and have dismissed the likelihood of mechanical failure or a hijacking. A high-ranking official told USA Today that Captain Zaharie's family is being scrutinised in the hope of shedding some light on the tragedy. A friend of the pilot yesterday revealed Captain Zaharie was in 'no state of mind to be flying' and had been left distraught by his wife's decision to move out of the family home. The father-of-three (left) had made no social or work-related plans for the future, unlike the rest of the crew. Malaysian police were also told of rumours that he was experiencing tensions with some family members . A friend of the pilot says it is possible Captain Zaharie took MH370 for a 'last joyride', in which he tried high-risk maneuvers he had perfected on his beloved home-made flight simulator . ‘He's one of the finest pilots around and I'm no medical expert, but with all that was happening in his life Zaharie was probably in no state of mind to be flying,’ he told the NZ Herald on the condition of anonymity. He said his friend's relationships were breaking down, adding it was possible Captain Zaharie took MH370 for a 'last joyride' in which he tried high-risk maneuvers he had perfected on his beloved home-made flight simulator. Aerial sweeps of the southern Indian Ocean for debris were suspended on Thursday as adverse weather conditions forced the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to recall 11 search aircraft to Perth. But five ships will remain in the 78,000-square-kilometre search area and continue to follow a new lead from French satellite images dated March 23 that showed 122 objects floating in the area more than 2,000 kilometres off Australia's west coast. An aviation meteorologist told the MailOnline that deteriorating weather was expected to make life difficult for military and civilian search personnel, and warned further delays were expected in the coming days.

Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) personnel unload a P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Pearce, before flying over the southern Indian Ocean to participate in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Aviation meteorologist Martin Babakhan said a front of warm air was moving into the cold search area, causing a thick, wall-like band of low cloud cover. 'When you have those sorts of front mixing in with the cooler temperatures from the ocean, the result is it creates high-level moisture - or 100 per cent humidity,' he told the MailOnline. 'Visibility is completely restricted for those aircraft out there. When these types of weather conditions occur at Sydney Airport, for example, the plane is switched into auto-pilot and GPS is used to land the plane automatically. 'You just can't do that out there over the ocean - it's a completely different environment. Even trying to fly underneath the cloud cover presents a safety risk, that's why they don't do it.' Mr Babakhan said the visibility issues would linger for approximately 24 hours before conditions begin to improve. He said AMSA would most likely call the ships back later Thursday as the swell becomes more aggressive in the search area. 'The waves will definitely start to get bigger as a result of the front moving through,' he said. 'We're talking about them ranging from three metres up to seven metres. 'It's very unlikely they will be able to find anything in those conditions until at least Saturday or Sunday.' French satellite images from March 23 have spotted 122 objects floating in a 155-square-mile area . Eleven aircraft and five ships were leading the recovery mission on Thursday, but they face a race against time as adverse weather conditions may again halt the search . The Malaysian Minister of Defence and acting Transport Minister Dato Seri Hishammuddin Hussein shows the pictures of the possible debris of the flight MH370 at a press conference . The location of potential objects related to the search of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 debris was shown by the Malaysian Remote Sensing Agency (MRSA) Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein revealed Wednesday that the news satellite images have dramatically narrowed the search zone, with the debris spotted across an area measuring just 155 square miles (400 square kilometres). Mr Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the images were captured by France-based Airbus Defence and Space on March 23. They are the fourth set of satellite images to show potential debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in a remote part of the Indian Ocean roughly 2,500 km (1,550 miles) south west of Perth. The objects are believed to be solid and range from one metre to 23 metres (three to 75 feet) long.","Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's youngest son says he doesn't believe his father is responsible for the fate of MH370 .

"Prompts could be printed on nappies in a bid to remind parents to talk to their babies more often under new proposals being discussed by a government-owned organisation. The Behavioural Insights Team, also known as the 'nudge unit' are to consider the plan, which would see parenting tips written on nappies. The idea was discussed during a recent meeting of the World Economic Forum in Dubai, which was attended by the team's chief executive officer Dr David Halpern. A new proposal has suggested that parenting tips could be printed on nappies to remind parents to talk to their babies as they change them . In a blog post he revealed how the idea was discussed in a meeting of the international council of behavioural policy makers, which talked about family ideas. He wrote: 'On parenting and families, probably the most left-field proposal was to prompt parents to talk to their kids by printing messages on nappies.' He added that the proposal would now be worked on by the team in the UK. After the meeting, the Forum published an article saying that parents should talk to their babies while changing their nappy to help them develop and improve their language skills. The World Economic Forum article said many parents stay silent when changing nappies as they are too focused on the task in hand . They add that small prompts could remind parents to chat to their children beacuse many remain silent as they concerntrate on the task in hand. The article said: 'Add a note on the front of the nappy encouraging parents to 'look up' and 'talk to your baby' or to narrate what they are doing as they change the nappy. 'Small prompts like these may be just enough to remind parents that every second, a baby's brain develops 700 new neural connections and that this is a good time to help make those connections stronger.' Recent studies have shown that mothers and fathers who hold a conversation with their babies are actually teaching them to speak more quickly. Researchers found new mothers who respond enthusiastically to their baby’s babbling are helping to speed up the child’s language development. US academics at the University of Iowa (UI) and Indiana University, said the evidence shows that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital. Meanwhile a separate study has recommended that babies should hear at least 21,000 words a day to help aid their development. However, the plan has divided parenting experts with some praising the 'creative idea' and others branding it as invasive. Dr Ben Laskey from The Psychology Partnership healthcare group told the Independent: 'The more ways of getting positive messages out to parents the better.' But Dr Ellie Lee from the Centre for Parenting and Culture Studies at the University of Kent added: 'You've got plenty to think about when you're changing a nappy. The idea of turning into an educational experience is insane.'","Suggestion that parenting tips could be printed on babies' nappies .

"Shocked guests told last night how they feared they had been caught up in a terror attack after an explosion rocked their five-star hotel in London. Fourteen people were injured when the blast caused by a suspected gas leak ripped a hole in the basement of the £300-a-night Hyatt Regency Churchill Hotel in Portman Square. In the aftermath of the explosion, 500 staff and guests – many still in their night clothes – were forced to flee the hotel. Bricks, rubble and pieces of plaster were still at the scene today after workers attempted to clear up the aftermath of an explosion a a five-star hotel in London . Today, workers were attempting to establish the cause of the blast and clear up the mess it had created . Debris and broken windows were seen today near the hotel in the wake of the dramatic explosion . Stewart Dyer, 40, who was there with his wife and baby daughter, said: ‘It was a huge bang. I thought straight away it might be a terrorist attack.’ Rashid Al Marri, 27, from Qatar, said: ‘My first thought was 9/11. It sounded like a bomb.’ Guest Ahmed Al Maadeed, 34, also from Qatar, said the ceiling ‘began shaking like in an earthquake’. Paramedics and firefighters raced to the scene of the blast, shortly before midnight on Friday. The establishment, in Portman Square, was evacuated after part of the building began to collapse . Six fire engines attended the scene and two men sustained leg injuries from the incident . A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: ‘The cause of the explosion is being investigated but is believed to have been caused by a gas leak.’ All of those hurt were night-time cleaners and five of them needed hospital treatment. A Hyatt spokesman said the hotel would be closed for the foreseeable future.","Fourteen people were injured following the gas explosion at the hotel .

"The mystery of the Loch Ness monster has drawn millions to the Highlands in the search of the mythical beast. More than 80 years since she was first photographed, a recent spate of Nessie sightings has added weight to the claims that there really is something lurking in the depths of the loch. But the numerous sightings of the so-called beast over the last weeks could be something far more mundane, with experts at the Woodland Trust suggesting people could just be seeing logs floating on the water. Scroll down for video . Earlier this year Richard Collis captured footage of Nessie's head and neck emerging from Loch Ness, but was it just a log? Branch or beast? Another picture taken on the loch showed a strange shape emerging from rough waters . Comparison: Monster photographer Jonathan Bright drew a rough sketch to show how he sees the mysterious object in the water . Several Nessie spotters have come forward in the last few weeks, but the environmental charity claim people could be mistaking driftwood for the mythical creature. The Woodland Trust say 'deadfall' washed out by rivers from nearby Urquhart Bay Wood could explain the vast number of sightings since the Loch Ness Monster was first photographed in 1934. 'Large amounts of wood flows out of the woodland through the two winding rivers that flow into Loch Ness each year, peaking when water is high in late autumn and spring,' a spokesman for the trust told the Independent. 'I think that some of that debris explains the long thin, sometimes stick-like, shapes seen.' The spokesman added that the wood was effectively a 'Nessie spawning ground'. Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster date back to the 6th century, but became more common from the 1930s after George Spicer and his wife claimed to see 'a most extraordinary form of animal' cross the road in front of their car. This underwater photograph from 1972 is said to have been taken during an expedition using sophisticated underwater cameras and sonar equipment . This picture, taken in 1934, sparked a surge in visits to Loch Ness by people desperate to photograph the beast . The Spicers' story led thousands of people to visit Loch Ness to try to take a photograph of the creature. After sonar searches, countless hoaxes and dozens of weird and wonderful explanations for the sightings, no one has taken a clear picture of Nessie. In 2006, palaeontologist Neil Clark, from Glasgow University's Hunterian Museum, put forward an intriguing explanation linking the Loch Ness monster sightings to elephants. He said circuses used to visit Inverness often and would stop on the banks of Loch Ness to give the animals a rest. There are similarities between trunks and some of the most famous Nessie photographs, he said. 'The circuses used to take the road up to Inverness and allow their animals to have a rest, swim about in the Loch and refresh themselves,' Dr Clark said at the time. More recently, images have emerged allegedly showing Nessie poking her head out of the water, but the blurry images and video are not clear cut. Last year a satellite picture from an Apple map app appeared to show a large, mysterious creature swimming through the loch. The Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said the sighting was 'likely' to be a true image of the beast. In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by an Apple map app . A poll conducted in 2012 found that 24 per cent of people professed belief in the Loch Ness monster . Following Nessie's first modern sightings in the 1930s, which were often printed in newspapers, thousands took to Loch Ness to try to take their own picture of the mysterious creature. Dozens of blurry images emerged, with some taking to creating elaborate hoaxes of the hidden beast. Here are some of the most famous sightings of the Loch Ness Monster. This blurred picture, said to show the Loch Ness Monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 .

"Top cop: Austin chief of police Art Acevedo was forced to apologize for comments he made in a press conference Friday . Austin police chief Art Acevedo has issued an apology for comments he made during a press conference yesterday concerning the arrest of a female jogger near the University of Texas campus on Thursday. Acevedo dismissed the controversy over police handling of a jaywalking jogger, saying 'Cops are actually committing sexual assaults on duty so I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in Austin, Texas.' Today, he released a statement saying that he was trying to put the arrest of jogger Amanda Jo Stephen 'into context by bringing attention to the fact that law enforcement deals with many acts of serious misconduct' including recent cases of police officers sexually assaulting civilians. 'In hindsight I believe the comparison was a poor analogy, and for this I apologize,' reads his statement. Acevedo says the press conference was 'the culmination of an emotional week,' referring to the conviction of Brandon Daniel for killing Austin police officer Jaime Padron in 2012. Stephen was taken into custody while out running on Thursday morning after she illegally crossed the street and allegedly refused to give her name to police officers. A bystander, Chris Quintero captured Stephen's dramatic arrest marked by sobbing and yelling on film whose video went viral after being posted on YouTube. On Saturday, a visibly irritated Chief Acevedo downplayed the entire incident and brushed off words of censure directed at his officers by social media users. ‘Thank you, lord, that it is a controversy in Austin, Texas - that we actually have the audacity to touch somebody by the arm and tell them, “Oh my goodness, Austin police we’re trying to get your attention,”’ Acevedo remarked sarcastically. ‘Whew! In other cities, cops are actually committing sexual assaults on duty, so I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in Austin, Texas.’ Scroll down for videos . She had it coming: Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo responded to the controversy surrounding the jogger's arrest, saying that Stephen was uncooperative and left officers no choice but to grab her hand and cuff her . Sarcastic: Chief Acevedo told reporters he thanks God that a jaywalker's arrest passes for controversy in Austin, while elsewhere in the country cops commit serious crimes on duty . Combative mood: Acevedo insisted that his officers have done nothing wrong, and that Stephen should consider herself lucky that she wasn't slapped with a charge of resisting arrest . The chief explained that two uniformed officers screamed at Stephen to stop, but the woman, who allegedly didn't hear them because she had her headphones on, continued on her way. Only then, Acevedo said, did one of the cops grab her arm from behind. Jailbird: Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, pictured in her booking after being charged with failure to identify stemming from a jaywalking incident . The chief also challenged the claim that the woman couldn't hear the cops because of the pink earbuds seen in photos of her arrest. According to police, the 24-year-old runner refused to divulge her name and was uncooperative. Quintero, who wrote a post of his blog lambasting police for startling the woman, later toned down his rhetoric, telling the station KTBC that even if the officer came up from behind, at some point Stephen must have realized that he was a law enforcement agent. While it was suggested earlier that the woman was dragged to the ground after being handcuffed, Acevedo revealed that Stephen sat down on her own accord and went limp, the Austin American Statesman reported. ‘She did the limp routine, and in 28 years of law enforcement, I can tell you it happens all the time,’ Acevedo said. Austin’s top cop added that the 24-year-old should consider herself lucky that he was not among the officers on the scene, who let her walk away with a failure to identify charge rather than the more serious count of resisting arrest. ‘I wouldn’t have been as generous,’ he warned. Stephen was one of 28 people who were stopped for jaywalking Thursday. A total of seven pedestrians were issued citations. Stephen's headline-making arrest took place just before 11am outside a fast-food eatery near the intersection of 24th Street and San Antonio Street in Austin. Busted: Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, is seen handcuffed and in tears following Thursday's arrest for a traffic violation in Austin . Caught on camera: Chris Quintero took pictures and video of the jogger's arrest; the college student said the 24-year-old crossed the street without waiting to the light to switch and was ordered to stop by police . Sporting a black crop top, shorts and toe sneakers, 24-year-old Amanda Jo Stephen was running across the street when an officer yelled for her to stop. According to Quintero, who saw the arrest play out from a nearby Starbucks, the jogger got caught in a police operation targeting jaywalkers, University of Texas' student newspaper The Daily Texan reported. Since Stephen had her headphones on, she allegedly didn't hear the officer and continued on her way. The officer quickly caught up with her and grabbed Stephen’s hand from behind, prompting her to push his hand away. Desperate pleas: A sobbing Stephen repeatedly told the officers that she did nothing wrong and was simply exercising . Lawbreaker: Austin PD said the woman has been charged with failure to identify herself to police and a class B traffic signal violation . An Austin police spokesperson told MailOnline Friday that Miss Stephen was handcuffed and taken into custody for failing to give her name to police. In Quintero's 2-minute video, the young woman with blond hair arranged in two braids in seen weeping on the ground with her hands restrained behind her back and two officers towering over her. At one point, the apprehended jogger notices Quintero taking pictures of her and declares: 'I was doing nothing wrong. I was crossing the street.' A moment later, a pair of uniformed cops, joined by two more cops on bikes, could be seen placing the sobbing woman into the back of a squad car, with her pleading and shrieking at the top of her lungs. ‘I didn’t do anything wrong! I didn’t do anything wrong! she said repeatedly. ‘I didn’t f***ing do anything wrong! I just crossed the street.’ Since going up on YouTube Thursday, Quintero's video has gone viral, drawing more than 17,000 views, and counting. Internet hit: Quintero's video showing the four burly man overpowering the slender young jogger has gone viral in a day . The Austin Police Department has denied that the officers seen in the video were specifically targeting jaywalkers, claiming instead that they were working 'pedestrian enforcement' to ensure traffic safety. The agency spokesperson told MailOnline Miss Stephen has been charged with failure to identify and a class B traffic signal violation. As of Friday, she was not listed as an inmate in the local jail, suggesting that she has been released on bond. 'Maybe the plus size cops should follow her lead, and go on a jog instead of wasting tax dollars on trivial matters... just a thought,' Quintero wrote in his blog.","Police chief Art Acevedo was issued an apology today over statements he made in a press conference yesterday .

"DIARY OF A MAD DIVA by Joan Rivers (Berkley £18.99) Might Joan Rivers be a little hard on herself? So old that ‘Abe Lincoln and I were an item,’ she says. And so ugly that ‘Cupid saw me naked and shot an arrow into his own head’. She reckons she never appealed to men — ‘not even my husband’, who committed suicide. To bring about a radical improvement, she has undergone compulsive plastic surgery — in this diary, she is always off to hospital, for a brow-lift, tummy tuck, chin job, lip implant, or what her doctors call ‘the usual’. She realises, however, that you can’t change in essence what you are — and what Joan is, essentially, beyond an 80-year-old clown with boundless mad energy, is a great and abrasive New Yorker, who, in the streets of Manhattan on an average morning is used to being shoved and banged into and told to ‘go f*** myself’ in three different languages. Joan Rivers is her own crazy creation, as funny and candid as ever reveals all in her new autobiography . She loves the cosmopolitanism of her city. She gets her pedicures from a Vietnamese sex slave, rides in taxis driven by Haitian ex-cons hiding from the police, and has Mexican servants who remind her of ‘Downton Abbey with sombreros’. It is a characteristic of the professional curmudgeon that hands that could help her regularly get bitten. Aggrieved she has never enjoyed a film career — if Hollywood wants a ‘mean, humpbacked Jew’, for some unaccountable reason ‘Jane Fonda always gets those roles’ — Joan has instead made a name for herself on cable television, mocking the celebrities who, in her estimation, are without exception ‘drug addicts, shoplifters or closet cases’. Pretty actresses and models, in Joan’s eyes, are bulimic twits who meet their ‘tweaked-out gay agents’ at hangouts such as The Ivy to discuss business ‘over scrambled egg whites they don’t eat’. All such sorts do in the first-class cabin on a plane is lock themselves in the lavatory, purging and vomiting. Then, they go and buy African children, whom they will love ‘until they reach puberty and the problems start’. Joan is gloriously scornful about the famous. Mia Farrow is ‘that psychotic bitch’. Style, to Aretha Franklin, meant trying to look impressive ‘while sweating mayonnaise through 60 yards of organza’. Joan reveals she began to have plastic surgery on her face when she realised men didn't find her attractive . Stars who give their offspring silly names get especially short shrift. In a sentence that made me laugh out loud, Joan says: ‘I always wanted to ask Gwyneth Paltrow, “Does Apple have worms?” ’ If little gives Joan more pleasure than watching ‘narcissistic actors pretending to be happy for someone else’ when they fail to win at an awards show, it would not be true to say that ordinary folk are immune from her wrath. Indeed, Joan’s disdain is democratically sprinkled about. ‘Why should blind people have apartments with park views?’ she asks, reasonably. Fussy eaters are an irritation — the ones who keep going through the menu, fretting, ‘Is there alcohol in tiramisu? Is there rum in rum cake?’ Self-pity annoys her enormously, as victims can be weirdly competitive about their rock-bottom moments: ‘I was drunk and raped by a gang of 12. It was a horrible moment. Four of them were Japanese and poorly endowed.’ Generally, Joan’s complaints are entirely justifiable. She resents having to pay taxes to fund ‘some teenage mother in Houston with five kids by seven different baby daddies’. Joan loathes waiters who say ‘no problem’, or ‘no worries’, when all you want is a cup of decaf. She gets steamed up with the stupidity of bookshop assistants — when she requested Paul Anka’s autobiography, she was asked, in all seriousness, ‘Who’s the author?’ She can’t abide it that television now panders only to audiences so idiotic, none can spell ‘mom’ backwards. Interviewers, too, are morons, incapable of deviating from their set list of questions. If you say, ‘I killed my mother’, they’ll ask, ‘I understand you like shoes?’ Joan is against the trend for audience participation, for example, Diana Ross wanting people to join in the chorus. ‘How did singing suddenly become my job? When I’m in Vegas, I don’t make my audience hold hands and tell the jokes.’ The popular comedienne always wanted a career as a Hollywood film star . It’s as bizarre a development as supermarkets suddenly deciding it’s green not to have shopping bags, which reminds Joan of restaurants without plates. ‘What do you do? Have the chef throw the food in your mouth?’ That’s a typical Joan syllogism. She pounces on small-scale annoyances and pumps them up until they are cosmic gripes, with surreal twists. ‘If you stutter,’ she counsels, ‘don’t look for work on a suicide hotline. D-d-d-d-don’t j-j-j-jump! Too late!’ Joan Rivers is her own crazy creation, wonderfully lacking in sentimentality, propelled by a healthy rage against political correctness and any form of priggishness. ‘Happiness is a rich husband with three days to live,’ is a trade-mark pronouncement. Half Mae West and half Dame Edna, she’s someone you wouldn't want to upset. ‘I hope she gets run over by a car driven by an uninsured driver, and the ambulance is stuck in traffic,’ is one of her average witch’s curses. We must be grateful, in the end, for modern developments in police forensic techniques, as ‘in the good old days, you shot some son of a bitch, pressed the smoking gun into his hand and got away with it’. Nowadays, what with DNA, high-tech sprays that show up blood, crumb analysis, carpet fibres and so forth, ‘there’s just no way a nice person like me can get away with murdering someone who really annoys me’. I know exactly how she feels. Every good joke told is a homicide averted.","Joan Rivers, 80, says she never appealed to men, even her own husband .

Spain's health ministry confirmed that an Ebola emergency protocol had been set in motion but declined to give details. There had been at least 160 people on board the flight which left Charles de Gaulle in Paris at 9.35am and arrived at 11.30am. An Air France spokesperson said the passenger had been isolated 'for medical checks', but other sources at the airline suggested that he did not have Ebola. France today became the fourth country after Britain, the United States and Canada to introduce screening for the virus at its main international airport. It came as the United Nations warned Ebola was outpacing efforts to combat the epidemic. Spain's government has stepped up its response to suspected Ebola cases in the wake of a health scare when a nurse in Madrid became the first person outside Africa to become infected with the deadly disease in the current outbreak. Teresa Romero, was diagnosed with the virus last week and is still seriously ill but stable. She had cared for two infected Catholic priests repatriated from West Africa and who later died. Air France said the other passengers disembarked from the plane, which was flying via Paris. The plane will now be disinfected and the return flight has been cancelled . An ambulance arrives at Carlos III hospital bringing the suspected Ebola case from the Air France plane . Spanish authorities said that a person who had been in contact with Ms Romero and was being monitored remotely for signs of the disease would be hospitalized, after developing a fever. The person was one of 68 considered to have a low risk of catching Ebola, and are required to check their temperature regularly from home. Another 15 people, including Romero's husband, are still under observation for signs of Ebola in Madrid's Carlos III hospital where she is also being treated, but have shown no symptoms. Carlos III hospital manager Rafael Perez Santamarina takes pictures with his mobile phone  of the ambulance carrying a suspected Ebola patient from an Air France plane that landed at Madrid Barajas airport . An ambulance transporting a potential Ebola virus carrier arrives at the Carlos III hospital in Madrid where 15 people are in quarantine as a precaution following the admission of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero . The World Health Organization  estimates the death toll from the worst outbreak of Ebola on record to have exceeded 4,400. It has called the outbreak the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'. West Africa is the worst affected area. In Liberia more than 2,300 people have died, while in Sierra Leone and Guinea stands at nearly 1,000 each. The deadly virus has also reached Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far.

"Two teenagers have been arrested after a 12-year-old boy and woman were left with burns after marine flares were thrown in the middle of an A-league game in Melbourne. The incident happened during the second half of Melbourne Victory's clash with Brisbane Roar at Etihad stadium on Friday night. Victoria Police say five flares were let off during the second half of the game and they believe young fans are being led astray by older patrons. A 12-year-old boy and woman were burnt after flares were let off during an A-League game in Melbourne . The incident happened in the second half of Melbourne Victory's clash with Brisbane Roar at Etihad stadium . Carl Valeri of Melbourne Victory crosses the ball during the round seven A-League match between the Melbourne Victory and Brisbane Roar at Etihad Stadium on Friday night . The teenagers who have been arrested are assisting police with their inquiries. North West Metro Commander Rick Nugent said letting off flares was dangerous and illegal and that anti-social behaviour has increased at the soccer this season despite the game's governing body, the league and authorities working tirelessly to improve community safety. 'Flares are extremely dangerous. They can burn at more than 1000 degrees Celsius and are not designed to be released in highly populated areas. 'They are not easily extinguished, they are designed for marine distress. 'They are not designed for highly populated areas like you have at sporting arenas. 'The increased criminality we are seeing at the soccer this season is completely unacceptable.' North West Metro Commander Rick Nugent told media on Saturday that letting off flares was dangerous and illegal . Since the first match on October 10 this season, 38 flares have been let off and about 200 chairs broken, he said. Commander Nugent said most of the 22,000 people attending Friday night's match were well behaved, but a certain group of individuals had other motives. He said he  believed older patrons could be leading younger supporters astray. 'Last year we had quite a successful season in terms of significantly reduced anti-social behaviour, violence and criminality at games. 'This year, I suspect part of it is that we have young people joining the active supporter areas that are being led astray by some older and more experienced people and are now embarking upon this sort of conduct.' The number of flares let off on Friday brings the season's total to 38 compared with eight last season, he said. Commander Nugent added letting off flares was dangerous and illegal but many people didn't seem to realise how risky it was. So far this season, about 30 people have been arrested at Victorian A-League soccer matches. The first match took place on October 10.","Boy, 12, and woman burnt after flares were let off during an A-League game .

"A 20-year-old woman who was beaten and held captive in a cupboard for a decade by her aunt - a convicted killer - is suing the city of Philadelphia for failing to prevent the horrifying ordeal. Beatrice Weston claims the city failed to properly train its care workers, resulting in her being given to her aunt, who had served eight years behind bars for starving her sister's boyfriend to death in 1981. Weston was allegedly beaten with a baseball bat, forced to consume her own urine, held in a tiny closet and prostituted in the 10 years she was in the custody of her aunt, Linda Ann Weston. The cruel conditions were discovered last October when four mentally-disabled adults were found in the dank, cramped basement of an apartment building where her aunt lived. Victim: Beatrice Weston is pictured in October after she was rescued from her aunt's home, where she was allegedly locked up for 10 years. She is now suing the city for failing to prevent the abuse . Accused: She says authorities should not have placed her in the care of her aunt, Linda Weston (pictured) as she had served eight years in prison for starving a man to death in 1981 (mug shot, right) The elder Weston and three others - including her daughter - were arrested, accused of holding the victims captive in order to claim on their Social Security checks. The abuse came even though Linda Weston had served eight years in prison after her first victim, Bernardo Ramos, 'was held captive for an extended period . of time, locked in a closet and literally starved to death', Police . Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Beatrice Weston's complaint says the city of Philadelphia failed to release information about the aunt's criminal history in 2002, after her mother said she could not care for her. Workers failed to carry out home . investigations or arrange for health evaluations of Beatrice, according to the lawsuit, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Dank: Weston is also accused of locking up four mentally disabled adults in the basement of her building . Cruel: The victims were found hiding under blankets and chained to walls last October by the landlord . It also names two other . defendants, Nefertiti Savoy, a former social worker with the Department of Human Services, and Richard Ames, an . attorney who recommended Weston be given to her aunt. 'Beatrice Weston was forcibly prostituted by Linda Ann Weston and was regularly beaten, starved, and denied medical and dental care, as well as schooling,' the lawsuit states. 'During these 10 years, the City of Philadelphia received numerous complaints that Linda Ann Weston was holding children captive in her basement.' The suit seeks damages for her anguish, payment for her medical and therapy expenses, and compensation for loss of past and future earnings, the Inquirer reported. 'Jurors are going to have to fix a value on every day, every month, every year that she was imprisoned,' her attorney Shanin Specter said. 'There's no amount of money that's fair.' Lair: Police officers show the basement where the four adults were kept so the suspects could take their Social Security checks. Beatrice Weston was locked in a cupboard upstairs . Killer: Linda Weston had been imprisoned for locking up her sister's boyfriend and starving him to death . Horrifying: Sgt. Joseph Green stands in the basement room where the victims were forced to urinate and bathe in a bucket for 10 days. Beatrice Weston said she was locked up for 10 years . She added that Weston is planning to go to school later this year. Linda Weston's attorney told CNN she had not seen the complaint and would likely not be representing her in any civil hearing. Sick: Beatrice's cousin Jean McIntosh allegedly taunted her through the cupboard door . She faces a trial in January on charges of kidnapping, assault, conspiracy, false imprisonment and other related counts to holding the four adults captive. Last January, Beatrice Weston explained . she had been held captive since she was 10 and starved, beaten and . forced into prostitution by her aunt and cousin, Jean McIntosh. She said she was locked inside a . closet inside an apartment in the same building where the adults were . found in the basement. She huddled on the floor under the shelves, she . said. 'I knew it was morning because light . came . through the window and the crack under the door,' she said, adding that . she was only allowed out once a day. 'Sometimes I got food, I think . once a day.' She added that her cousin taunted her, saying through the door: 'Don't you . wish that you was out of that closet taking a hot shower like me?' When she was found, police noted she had pellet gun wounds and burn marks, suggesting she was scolded with a hot spoon. 'She is in very, very poor . condition,' Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Ray Evers said at the time. 'She has lost . a lot of weight. She has newer injuries, definitely some older . injuries, a lot of scarring.' The four mentally disabled adults - Edwin Sanabria, Herbert Knowles, Tamara Breeden and Derwin McLemire - were found locked in the room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet and a bath. Caught: Gregory Thomas, left, and Eddie Wright were also arrested in the Social Security check scheme . Freed: Three of the victims speak out after the horrifying ordeal last October . Their plight was discovered when the building's landlord, Turgut Gozleveli, came across two dog bowls in the apartment block, even though pets were not allowed. He asked all the tenants if they had . any animals and, when they said no, he searched the basement for pets - . but instead came across the starving victims hiding under quilts and . chained to the walls. Police reports noted the pitch-black, 13-by-7 foot space reeked of urine and feces. Rags and tatty were scatted throughout the tiny room, which housed an old boiler. 'I used the bucket to go to the . bathroom. Others used the same bucket,' Sanabria testified in January. He added that for a bath, they 'used the same bucket we used . to urinate in'. McIntosh, 32, and Linda Weston, 51, were arrested. Her boyfriend, Gregory Thomas, 47, and Eddie Wright, 50, were also charged with taking Social Security checks. They go on trial in January.","Linda Ann Weston awarded custody of her niece Beatrice Weston, then 10, when her mother could no longer care for her .

"The manipulation of Libor by Barclays is likely to be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ in terms of fraudulent activities by banks, according to a former head of the U.S. securities regulator. Hervey Pitt, the former chairman of the Washington-based Securities and Exchange Commission, said: ‘It is in Barclays’ interest to prove the old adage that misery loves company and I expect they’ll be implicating a lot of their colleagues in other banks. ‘This is the proverbial tip of the iceberg.’ Money worries: RBS Group and other banks saw shares slump as fears grew they could be hit with huge fines . Dramatic: Shares in RBS Group were hit hard as details of the Barclays penalty rattled the banking sector . Barclays was fined £130million by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the largest penalty ever by the agency. It has also agreed to pay £100million to the US Justice Department, whose criminal investigation continues. The U.S. Justice Department decided to levy the fine rather than pursue litigation against Barclays. Mr Pitt said this was a matter of ‘taking the bird in hand’ rather than risk taking action through the courts. The £230million in fines in the U.S. makes up most of the £292million levied on Barclays and its subsidiaries . on both sides of the Atlantic, following an agreement between . regulators in Washington and London. Under pressure: Lloyds Banking Group and RBS Group, led by chief executives Antonio Horta-Osario (left) and Stephen Hester (right) respectively, are both under investigation . Scrutiny: Lloyds Banking Group's London headquarters. Analysts say fines could be imposed across the sector . Devalued: Shares in Lloyds Banking Group slumped yesterday morning but rallied slightly during the afternoon . Speaking to Bloomberg Television, Mr . Pitt continued: ‘This is a phenomenal example of the ability of both the . UK and the U.S. authorities to work together. ‘This really should give marketplace . participants a lot of hope, and for those who are thinking of violating . the law a lot of fear, that different governments will work together . constructively and come up with cases of this nature.’ The massive fines are unlikely to be . the end of the pain for Barclays. Crisis: George Osborne told MPs that Barclays was 'not alone' in its efforts to rig interest rates . The cost of lawsuits related to the . Libor scandal are likely to be bigger, according to Sandy Chen, banking . analyst at Cenkos Securities. He added: ‘Since Royal Bank of . Scotland, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group have also been named in . lawsuits, we expect they will also face significant fines and damages. ‘We are pencilling in multi-year provisions that could run into the billions.’ The Barclays case follows co-ordinated . investigations lasting years and is just the first in a series of . potential cases against other financial firms, including HSBC, Citigroup . and JPMorgan Chase. American regulators have issued . subpoenas to banks including UBS, Citigroup, and Bank of America . regarding how Libor rates are calculated. Canada’s Competition Bureau is looking into the activities of Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and others. At least nine agencies have carried . out investigations into Libor, including the Financial Services . Authority in Britain and Japan’s Financial Supervisory Agency. Authorities across the world are also looking into the activity surrounding similar interest benchmarks such as . Tibor, the Tokyo interbank rate, and Euribor, the eurozone rate. Bart Chilton, commissioner of the . CFTC, said: ‘This thing was about smoke, mirrors and sneaky backroom . dealings with potentially dangerous effects on the world economy.’ He added that it was essential that . there be ‘a sturdy firewall’ between bank workers involved in setting . the Libor rate and traders. Uncertainty: The scandal comes only days after RBS Group, which owns NatWest, suffered an embarrassing computer crisis .","Analysts say penalties could dwarf the record £290m fine for Barclays .

"An astonishing photograph album created by one of the men who helped launch Britain’s first submarines has emerged for the first time after it was released by his family. The previously unseen pictures show the embryonic stages of the submersible machines from the very first years of the 20th century. Cpt John Moreton’s album also includes snaps from the late 19th century and captures the time when the Napoleonic era of sail was being replaced by newer technologies. Emerging naval power: This photo in Captain John Moreton's incredible album shows a submarine with HMS Victory in the background, depicting the changing technologies from sail to submersibles . Going under: A sequence of pictures showing one of the very early submarines submerging. The album has delighted naval enthusiasts and is expected to fetch thousands at auction . The discovery has delighted naval enthusiasts and it gives a glimpse into a past world when the British Empire that was built through her navy was still all-powerful. Moreton was a protege of Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon who pushed for the development of subs despite much opposition. Some of the pictures show the great vessels of previous eras including Lord Nelson’s ship HMS Victory that helped defeat the French and Spanish navies at Trafalgar in 1805. She is seen afloat and clearly remained a commissioned vessel, flying the white ensign. The album includes well over 100 . photos mostly taken at Portsmouth, Hants, and shows the brave men who . crewed the experimental submarines. Both . Bacon and Moreton moved to the brand new destroyer Dreadnought after . she was launched in 1906, and this powerful ship is also pictured. Its design redefined the battleship, making all previous ships out of date. There . includes an amazing shot of a broadside of a Majestic-class ship, and . shows her in a cloud of smoke made from the firing of her huge guns. Another . photo shows a dockside scene at Portsmouth with crowds of people, . including ladies under parasols and a police constable. The man himself: Cpt Moreton stands proudly on top of a submarine, a technology he was instrumental in bringing to the British navy . Pioneers: Some of the brave crew who manned the experimental machines with a sub moored alongside a depot ship in Portsmouth . In it, a Royal Sovereign class steam . ship is pictured afloat as well as two men-of-war from the Napoleonic . era, including one of which is the Victory, the other may be the Duke of . Wellington. Another shot . shows HMS Dreadnought - the most modern ship of the time - with HMS . Victory in the background, representing over 100 years of Royal Navy . vessels. And between them, . three submarines can be seen - representing the future. One shot shows . Moreton himself standing on the deck of a submarine with his arms . akimbo. The first British sub, H1, was launched in 1901, and the album includes photos of H2 and H3 that followed shortly afterwards. They were named ‘H’ after John . Holland, an Irish-born American who perfected the working submarine. There is a picture of one sub moored to the side of a ship, HMS Hazard, . and others show them submerging. The boats didn’t have proper names . because there was a feeling that submarine warfare was a bit underhand. Indeed, Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson VC in 1901 described them as . ‘underhand, unfair and damned un-English.’ Incredible insight: The album, which has come into public view for the first time after permission was granted by Cpt Moreton's family, will go up for auction on April 25 . New technology: Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon and officers on HMS Hazard, a ship that supported the submarine experiments, in 1901 . However, . with Lord ‘Jacky’ Fisher pushing for the technology and backing Admiral . Sir Reginald Bacon, submarine development advanced quickly. And with Bacon supporting talented men such as Cpt Moreton, submarines became an accepted arm of the senior service. The . album is to go under the hammer at Charles Miller auctions in London on . April 25 and is expected to fetch several thousand pounds. Mr Miller said: ‘This is an extraordinary and fascinating album that was compiled by Cpt John Moreton. He was a protege of Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon whose work on submarines had the important backing of Lord Jacky Fisher. ‘There was a feeling at first that submarines were a little underhand and people looked down on them. But Jacky Fisher correctly predicted they would be important and this albums records the very early days. ‘And it straddles the modern era of ships such as Dreadnought with the past era of sail typified by HMS Victory. Between them is the story of the development of the submarine. They were very small and were expensive to develop. Past and future: HMS Dreadnaught in the front, HMS Victory in the distance and between them three submarines . Historic: The dock at Portsmouth with a Royal Sovereign class ship on the left and HMS Victory to starboard . ‘They didn’t even have proper names because they weren’t considered important enough. ‘These photos show pictures of the crews and it really is a wonderful record of this period of our naval history.’ Wyn Davies, a maritime heritage expert and author, said: ‘This looks like a splendid collection of photographs of some historic importance. ‘In one shot alone there is a battleship, plus HMS Dreadnought, HMS Victory, a survey vessel or colonial gunboat and three submarines. ‘The album shows vessels from the 18th century right through to HMS Dreadnought and the submarines that represent the future.’ Moreton was promoted to commander in 1909 transferred ultimately to the Indomitable. He had a distinguished career in the Great War, gaining the DSO and promotion to captain. He died of pneumonia in 1920 aged 43 while on active service.","Over 100 pictures chart move from Napoleonic sail to submersibles .

"The last surviving Nazi officer to take part in the Greek island massacre that formed the backdrop to  'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' has been handed a full life sentence. Wermacht corporal Alfred Stork was convicted of ordering the slaughter of 117 Italian officers on the Greek island of Cephalonia in 1943. The senseless slaughter, which continued for days, was immortalised in the bestselling 1994 novel, a love story about a Greek girl and an Italian officer, which became a film starring Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz. Executed: Platoon commander Alfred Stork allegedly ordered the execution of 117 Italian officers of the Acqui Division (pictured) on the Greek island of Cephalonia in 1943 . The killings formed part of a mass reprisal by Nazi troops after Italy changed sides during the war. In . Italian-occupied Cephalonia, the Italian general gave his troops three . options, telling them to follow their conscience: fight on with Germany, . surrender or resist. Five . thousand Italian prisoners were shot dead after they had surrendered and . another 1,300 died in fighting. 3,000 drowned when a ship carrying them . to Nazi concentration camps sank. The . bodies of 200 men were tossed down a well, from which they were only . recovered and sent back home a few months before former Italian . president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi visited the island in 2001. Stork was not present in court for the sentence and in any case would not serve time in jail in Italy because of his age. Inspiration: The war-time atrocity forms the backdrop to the bestselling 1994 novel by Louis de Bernieres (left) before it was turned into a Hollywood movie in 2001 (right) starring Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz . Tragic: The film, and book, follows the exploits of Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain with the Acqui Division which refused to surrender to the Germans, fighting for nine days before running out of ammunition. Some 1,500 Italian soldiers died in the fighting while 5,000 were massacred after surrendering . Military . prosecutor Marco De Paolis said: 'He did not have the courage to . maintain his admission of guilt and stayed comfortably in his home in . Germany.' The prosecution was barred from submitting a 2005 confession by Stork because he made it with no defence lawyer present. In it he allegedly told German prosecutors . he was part of two execution platoons that killed the Italians . because they were 'considered traitors’. De Paolis . said: ‘All the German soldiers present in Cephalonia, and also Stork, . were fully aware that the order received to kill the prisoners was . illegal, an order which it was their duty not to obey.’ In his submissions the prosecutor argued that Stork’s guilt is already determined by witnesses who identified his platoon as the executioners. But he said that the case had been a struggle because fellow officers who are still alive would not incriminate Stork. 'There is a disgusting code of silence,' he said. Stork . deserved the full life term, he said, 'in view of the extreme gravity . of the crime, the cruelty with which it was carried out, the total . disregard for the victims and the refusal of the accused to cooperate in . any way with the courts.' The reasons for the verdict and sentence will be published in anything up to three months.","Alfred Stork led squad that killed 117 Italian officers on Cephalonia in 1943 .

"Lingering suspicion directed at the captain of missing flight MH370 has today lifted, as FBI investigators reveal they found 'nothing sinister' on his home-built flight simulator. Officials in Kuala Lumpur declared that Malysian police and the FBI's technical experts have found nothing to suggest Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was planning to hijack the flight after closely  examining his flight simulator. Police who raided the 53-year-old's house in a wealthy part of Kuala Lumpur seized the simulator, taking it apart piece by piece, to examine its hard drive for clues. Suspicious: The captain of the missing airline MH370, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, has been dubbed the 'chief suspect' in Malaysia's official police investigation into the incident . The criminal inquiry cleared all the  intelligence checks completed for all the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur. The only individual arousing suspicion was Captian Shah . The probe revealed that logs had been deleted on February 3. It meant records of what Captain Shah had been up to on the simulator prior to that date had been erased. Experts who have anaylsed the programme, successfully extracting vital flight and technique records, are said to have found nothing to raise suspicion. 'As far as I know, there is nothing sinister on the simulator but of course that will have to be confirmed by the chief of police,' Mr Hussein Hishammuddin, Malaysia's Defence Minister and acting Minister of Transport, said in Kuala Lumpur today. He made the dramatic revelation at a briefing after meeting relatives of the Boeing 777's passengers, most of whom were Chinese. The father-of-three (left) had made no social or work-related plans for the future, unlike the rest of the crew. Malaysian police were also told of rumours that he was experiencing tensions with some family members . Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters: 'As far as I know, there is nothing sinister on the simulator but of course that will have to be confirmed by the chief of police' Until the revelation, suspicion had lingered over the pilot. Had he practiced landing on a remote airfield where he intended to take MH370? Had he tried sending a make-believe aircraft on a crazy joy ride, taking it up to 45,000ft and then putting it into a plunge? Those were the questions that many were asking about his activities on the simulator, but the FBI has concluded he was up to nothing suspicious. The lessening of the pilot's complicity in the fate of the aircraft is now expected to focus on the jet experiencing a major catastrophic event which forced Captain Zaharie and his 27-year-old co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid to turn it around from its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing route and head west to the nearest airfield. However, some experts believe that smoke, depressurisation or some other disaster had rendered the pilots incapable of controlling the aircraft and auto-pilot had taken it out into the Indian Ocean. Mr Hishammuddin said police would clarify the results of the examination of the simulator very soon, as investigations continue with international agencies into all aspects of the aircraft's disappearance.","Malaysian minister Hishammuddin Hussein told the media in Kuala Lumpur today that there is 'nothing sinister' on the simulator .

Flaunting it: The 25-year-old reality TV star went for the cheeky breast grab as she cooled off on the show earlier this week . Model turned designer? Perhaps Nadia could forge a career as a bikini designer after fashioning her own out of leaves and string in the jungle this week . I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Rear! Kendra Wilkinson, a fotmer Playboy bunny, lifted up her towel to expose her pert derriere and insisted she would have to work out ahead of Nadia joining camp . Cold, Gemma? Miss Collins was only in the jungle for three days but she still managed to squeeze in a quick shower scene . More modest: Gemma, 33, has since quit the show but took time to have a cold shower in her modest black swimming costume . Iconic: Myleene Klass became more famous for her white bikini-clad shower scene in 2006 than her jungle antics and now she's a household name . Pageant queen: Amy Willerton was relatively unknown when she entered the jungle last year but has since gone on to land herself men's magazine covers and numerous modelling gigs - so was it thanks to her shower scenes? Seeing a flash of a good bikini bod has become as synonymous with I'm A Celebrity as the sight of some D-lister eating a witchetty grub. It can work wonders on sales of swimwear and on the wearer's career. Just look how Myleene Klass reinvented herself from pop princess to pin-up and Helen Flanagan's transition from teenage Corrie star to FHM's sexiest woman is case in point. Thanks to Myleene, sales of white bikinis sky-rocketed. Then Helen Flanagan tried her luck in one similar, and even Matthew Wright had a go, as scary as that was! Gemma Collins attempted to get in on the action and she donned a black one-piece, which looked great on her. And that's the point. Wearing swimwear that is right for your shape and which flatters your assets is paramount. It's so unsightly if you get it wrong and, to be honest, very unfair on other beach users. Be careful in a triangle cut top if your breasts are too big, one cut slightly higher and supported is better and much more flattering. If you've got broad shoulders, opt for a halter-neck which balances your dimensions. If you're looking for bikinis which are slimming, try one with clever contouring trims on tops and high-waisted bottoms, and if you're short then wear a slinky bikini with spaghetti straps. If you're feeling daring, reach for something with cut-out details on the sides, but be careful of those which feature metal rings... imagine them in the heat! Catapulting her to stardom: Helen Flanagan's bikini scenes in 2012 helped promote her from Coronation Street sweetheart to lad mag favourite - and she even topped FHM's Sexiest Woman in the World poll . From Essex to stardom: Not only did Stacey Solomon, 25, take home the jungle queen crown in 2010 but she's since landed numerous campaigns and modelling gigs . Remember me?

"The family of a senior First World War commander tried to get Lord Attenborough's film Oh! What A Lovely War banned because they regarded it as a 'sordid' insult to his memory. Descendants of the late Field Marshal Sir John French, who led the British Expeditionary Force from 1914 to 1915, took legal advice and appealed to the film censor. On July 7, 1968, his son Colonel John French, who has also since died, wrote to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), calling it a 'despicable attempt to create sensation for the sordid purpose of making money'. The family's letters have been found in the BBFC archive. Scroll down for video . The family of Field Marshal Sir John French (left) tried to get Lord Attenborough's (right) film Oh! What A Lovely War banned . When told of their concern, Lord Attenborough said he had hired a 'battery of lawyers' to ensure that the musical satire was not offensive or libellous. He said that it was anti-war, but very 'pro-soldier'. In his letter to Sir John Trevelyan, the then Director of the BBFC, French is particularly alarmed by reports that his father who is to be played by Sir Laurence Olivier will be seen dancing while the casualties continue to mount up on the front line. He wrote: 'It appears to be a disgraceful performance making fun of a time of great national peril and falsely portraying the Commander-in-Chief as indulging in dancing while the fighting was going on and his men were being killed.' 'In appealing to your board to prevent this despicable attempt to create sensation for the sordid purpose of making money, I would point out that not only the reputation of a great soldier is involved but the prestige of the British Army. Laurence Olivier's depiction of Sir John (pictured) was seen as prancing and pouting by critics . Colonel French said the production should either be banned or the offensive references to his father should be removed. Three days after receiving the letter Trevelyan wrote to Attenborough to warn him of the Colonel's concerns. Attenborough assured Trevelyan that the film was anti-war rather than anti any particular soldier. He wrote: 'When the first letter arrived, I held a special screening of all the material for a positive battery of lawyers who unanimously proclaimed that the film is neither libellous or offensive. He added: 'Let me assure you John that I would never have anything to do with a film such as the one Colonel French mentions in his letter and in fact I believe that the only way to be truly ante-war is to be pro–soldiers, for if one dislikes the soldiers, it's difficult to get concerned when they become casualties.' 'As you know we have totally eschewed blood and gore and are trying to make our points by means of speech based upon historical record. I cannot believe that Colonel French would wish to curb my right to read history aloud.' Just weeks earlier Lord Attenborough wrote to Trevelyan to share the 'dread' and 'insane' news that he was about to direct his first film. Lord Attenborough's 1969 film Oh! What a Lovely War starring Kenneth Moore as the Kaiser and John Clements as Von Moltke . Vanessa Redgrave starred in the film as Sylvia Pankhurst alongside Laurence Olivier . Attenborough who would go on to direct a string of hit films including Gandhi, Shadowlands and Cry Freedom wrote: 'You might have heard but in case you haven't I write to tell you of the dread news that I am about to take the fatal step of directing my first film. Nothing easy of course, like a contained little domestic drama, but a picture shot entirely on location with almost 40 musical numbers in it and a cast that would put your eye out. You see, I am insane,' Sir John French carved out a reputation for himself during the Boer War, He headed the BEF for the first two years of the First World War and was then made Commander in Chief, Home Forces. He retired from the British Army in April 1921 and was elevated to the Earl of Ypres in 1922. Opinion about French's contribution to the war effort remains divided to this day. The late Alan Clark described him as weak willed man of medium height in Donkeys his seminal history of the first world war. But other commentators have been far more generous and they stress that French was a far more popular figure in the ranks than other senior figures like Kitchener or Haig. His family may have been right, however, to be wary of how Olivier performance which was subsequently described as pouting and prancing. Sir John French died aged 72 in 1925 and his son died in 1958. Laurence Olivier's depiction of Sir John was seen as prancing and pouting by critics.","Family of Field Marshal Sir John French tried to get film banned .

"The family of a seven-year-old boy who died within a week of undergoing heart surgery have spoken of their anger after a report found that Bank Holiday staff shortages at an NHS hospital were partly to blame for the tragedy. Luke Jenkins had been expected to make a full recovery from his operation but died over the Easter weekend after suffering a cardiac arrest at Bristol Children's Hospital. A hospital investigation into his death uncovered a catalogue of avoidable errors, including the loss of vital time because junior staff did not know where to find resuscitation equipment. Suffering: Luke Jenkins died within a week of undergoing corrective heart surgery at Bristol Children's Hospital . Because the emergency happened on a . Bank Holiday weekend, a surgeon had to be called in from home to treat . Luke, the inquiry found. The . contents of the report have shocked Luke's grieving parents, who . believe their son would still be alive if he had received the care he . needed. Stephen Jenkins, . 30, and Faye Valentine, 27, of St Mellons, Cardiff, south Wales, have also . raised concerns about the standard of the investigation into Luke's . death. Mr Jenkins said: 'Luke fought it (his heart condition) as hard as he could but in the end they let him down. 'He wanted to grow up to be a doctor - he wanted to help children, he didn't want anyone to suffer like he had. Anger: Luke's parents, Steve Jenkins and Faye Valentine, hold a copy of the investigation report into their son's death . 'We're fighting this for him. We want answers and we want to raise awareness. What about the children who are there now?' Luke was born with a congenital heart defect and had already undergone two of three corrective operations. He went into the hospital for the third operation and it was deemed a success. He was initially kept in intensive care but was transferred to another ward, Ward 32, after a few days. He suffered a cardiac arrest on Good Friday. Junior nursing staff lost vital time . because they did not know where resuscitation equipment on Ward 32 was kept. The emergency team was also unfamiliar with the equipment because cardiac arrest was rare in the ward environment. The . fact that Luke suffered a cardiac arrest on Good Friday meant that the . duty surgeon was at home when he collapsed and had to be urgently called . in to attend hospital. The investigators' report, called a 'root cause analysis' (RCA), does not specify when the call was made, but it states that the surgeon was at the scene within 19 minutes. 'On the 6th April when the patient . deteriorated it was a bank holiday; although it is recognised that the . resuscitation team arrived quickly,' the document states. 'The cardiac surgeon had responded from home and had the chest open within 19 minutes of the emergency call.' 'Fighter': Luke Jenkins, seen playing in these family photographs, had been expected to make a full recovery after undergoing corrective heart surgery . What is clear is that Luke's heart . stopped for 43 minutes before he was resuscitated, after which he . underwent exploratory surgery. He died the following day. While staff numbers on the ward was . set according to official guidance, low staff levels had been a problem . for at least two years. 'A . risk assessment identifying low and unsafe nurse staffing and high . dependency patient acuity issues was developed following a high-risk . incident in October 2010 remains outstanding,' the report states. There . have been eight separate patient safety incidents on the ward since . January, two of which prompted 'high-risk' investigations. All eight were linked to problems of low staffing levels. Luke Jenkins, pictured in a black and white portrait (left) and dressed as computer game character Mario (right), died over the Easter weekend when there were hospital staff shortages . Other . worrying factors include the resetting of potentially vital alarms on . Luke's condition monitoring equipment after his arrival on Ward 32. 'The . patient was frequently triggering the alarms on his monitoring . equipment; and the family witnessed the alarms being reset to a lower . threshold by the nursing staff to stop the alarms from being activated,' the report states. 'Triggering the alarms did not appear to trigger a medical review.' The 40-page report makes eight recommendations and draws a raft of conclusions based on the experience of Luke's tragic death. But the child's parents claim the report is less than honest and fails to give a true picture of what really happened. Emergency: The report revealed that Luke Jenkins's heart stopped for 43 minutes before he was resuscitated. He died the following day . Concerns: Luke Jenkins's parents believe he would still be alive if he had received the care he needed . They . claim a series of factual errors appear to combine to hide the full . extent of the negligence their son suffered. An assertion that Luke . underwent an x-ray the day before his death is questioned in a letter . sent in reply to the report. 'If . he had had an X-ray they would have found what was wrong with him and . he would still be here now,' said Mr Jenkins. 'But we were . with him all day and we know that it never happened.' He said that the family intended to fight on until the full truth was revealed. 'If he had an X-ray they would have found what was wrong with him and he would still be here now.' Luke's father Stephen Jenkins . 'There . have been eight other incidents since January 2012. They cannot tell us . who the people were but that should be made public,' Mr Jenkins said. 'We have written saying that we are not happy with the report.' He said one major problem was that nursing staff failed to listen to them when they were anxiously calling for help for Luke. That . view is supported by the report itself, which states: 'Failure to . listen to the 'voice of the patient' is recognised to be a major . contributory factor in patient safety investigations.' However, . it concluded: 'The RCA team were unable to comment on whether listening . to the family on this occasion would have changed the patient outcome.' Inquiry: The report stated that a catalogue of avoidable human errors at Bristol Children's Hospital (pictured) had fatal consequences for Luke .","Luke Jenkins was expected to make full recovery after undergoing corrective surgery at Bristol Children's Hospital .

"Jimmy Savile was given his own keys to high-security Broadmoor mental hospital, it emerged yesterday. The gold-plated set was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed. The extraordinary revelation came as NHS chiefs came under mounting pressure to start an inquiry into Savile’s freedom to sexually abuse child patients. Savile, seen at Broadmoor in 1991, as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe meets boxer Frank Bruno, who was on a visit to open a new gym . He was given bedrooms or an office at three hospitals, and yesterday more former patients came forward to say he abused them on children’s wards. There are growing fears NHS bosses turned a blind eye to sick and disabled children being attacked by Savile because he raised so much money for them. Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire – where nurses warned children to ‘pretend to be asleep’ when the Jim’ll Fix It star came calling – made £40million from his fundraising. The TV entertainer volunteered as a porter to gain access to children recovering from cancer and brain surgery, and sexually assault them. He said hospital chiefs ‘realised I might be useful to them’ and boasted he was ‘untouchable’. Chilling picture: Savile outside the cafe named Jimmy's - in the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire - in November 2005 . A former Stoke Mandeville nurse yesterday . claimed managers were ‘well aware’ that Savile – given a bedroom at the . hospital for two decades – was a child abuser. Holly, from Dover, told . LBC radio: ‘Jimmy Savile molested one of the patients on the paediatric . unit. He was not supposed to go on any children’s wards unaccompanied. ‘Stoke Mandeville were well aware of . what was going on. For them to say now they knew nothing is complete . lies. They knew. It makes me so angry. He raised all this money for . them. There has been a massive cover-up.’ The . National Association for People Abused in Childhood said it had been . ‘inundated’ with calls about Savile. Chief executive Pete Saunders said: . ‘Two this morning told us that not only did Jimmy Savile abuse them at . Stoke Mandeville but a doctor did as well.’ Mental hospital: A gold-plated set of keys to Broadmoor was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed . Labour leader Ed Miliband called for . every institution connected to Savile to hold a ‘far-reaching . investigation’ into ‘who knew what when about what was happening and why . nothing was done about it’. Tory MP Rob Wilson, an aide to the Health Secretary, demanded an independent inquiry into the scandal at Stoke Mandeville. Mr Wilson said: ‘It is being alleged that . his money-raising made him untouchable, despite the information that . circulated about his behaviour. It must be a priority that the hospital . answers these concerns as soon as possible before huge damage is done to . its reputation.’ He added: ‘I am astonished to learn . Savile had keys to Broadmoor, one of the highest security hospitals in . the country. From what we’ve learned he should have been locked inside . the institution, not been given the keys.’ One . Broadmoor victim claimed the Top Of The Pops presenter put his hand up . her nightdress when she was 17 after walking in on a group of girls . watching TV in 1969. Alison . Pink said: ‘I felt absolutely disgusting afterwards, like I had been . used as a piece of meat for his sexual gratification.’ Big money: Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire - where nurses warned children to 'pretend to be asleep' when the Jim'll Fix It star came calling - made £40million from his fundraising . She said Savile kept his own mobile home . in the grounds of the Berkshire hospital, where patients include . Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe. ‘He definitely had his own keys – they . were gold, especially for him. Both male and female patients thought it . was very strange. He could access any of the girls’ bedrooms.’ Alison, who has since had a sex . change and is now Steven George, 60, of Portsmouth, added: ‘He made very . good friends with patients on the male ward, which was full of sex . offenders.’ Broadmoor hospital did not deny Savile . had been given keys, but said the allegations related to a time when it . was run as a ‘separate, somewhat isolated’ organisation. A spokesman . said volunteer access and activity at Broadmoor was now strictly . controlled and the hospital operated ‘within strict child and adult . safeguarding guidelines’. Meanwhile, psychiatric nurse Naomi Stanley told the Guardian that a patient told her she had been frequently abused by the star while she was in hospital in the 1980s. She said the young woman said Savile had raped her repeatedly near the stage of the theatre at the hospital and that Savile had claimed 'nobody would believe her and he could do what he liked' when she threatened to report him. The woman told the nurse Savile was 'very forceful' and 'treated her like she was an animal', and the nurse was left with no doubt the woman was extremely distressed by the alleged attacks. Leeds General Infirmary, where Savile raised also millions of pounds and was given his own office, has declared ‘shock’ at claims he groped vulnerable children recovering from surgery while volunteering as a porter. Two more victims came forward there yesterday. Thirteen police forces have now taken statements from people claiming they were raped or molested when they were children by the late BBC presenter, who died last October aged 84. Scotland Yard has branded Savile a ‘predatory sex offender’ who preyed on children as young as 13 for four decades in a nationwide campaign of abuse. Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which is responsible for Stoke Mandeville, said it was supporting the police inquiries and would take further action ‘if their findings suggest that we do need to’. It also said it had advised staff to contact police if they had any concerns. West London Mental Health Trust, which covers Broadmoor, said it had not received any allegations of abuse from patients, their representatives or from staff, but would co-operate with police if they investigated.","Gold-plated keys to high-security mental hospital was presented to him .

"Two schoolgirls waiting for a bus were showered in blood and guts from a lorry carrying animal carcasses when it hit a bump in the road. Lilly Tomlinson-Hulme and Lydia Hopwood had to be collected from school after showing up to class 'smelling of blood and cow'. The 11-year-old's from Weston Coyney, Staffordshire, said they were 'embarrassed' and 'felt sick all day'. An investigation has now been launched by Staffordshire County Council into the incident. Lilly Tomlinson-Hulme and Lydia Hopwood were showered in blood and guts as they waited for a school bus when a lorry carrying animal carcasses drove past them and hit a speed bump . 'We were waiting for the bus when a really smelly truck came past. 'I felt this splash of cold, it felt like water. There were stains on me that looked like blood. 'When I got to school my friends said I stank of blood and cow. I was a bit embarassed, I felt sick all day,' said Lilly. The 11-year-old's mother was horrified when the girls' school called to tell her her daughter was 'covered in blood'. 'It was awful. I got a phone call from the school to say my daughter was covered in blood on her hands and face. I couldn't believe what I was hearing,' said Claire Hulme. 'Lilly was a little bit upset, but once she had a bath she was not too bad. But it is a bit embarrassing to have to go to school covered in blood. The 11-year-old's were sent home from school 'smelling like blood and cow' 'I had to wash her school uniform twice to get rid of the smell of blood. 'Apparently 17 wagons went through Weston Road on Thursday morning. 'But if children are getting hit with blood when they are waiting for a bus then something needs to be done about it.' Lydia's mother described it as a 'public health issue', adding: 'Lydia sent me a text to say something really horrible had happened. 'I thought she was exaggerating but when I called her I couldn't believe it when she told me what had happened. 'When she got home she jumped in the shower and I bunged all her clothes in the wash. 'In the summer the smell of animal waste along Weston Road is disgusting.' Moorside High School headteacher Simon Clarke confirmed three students were sent home to get cleaned up. Two of the families have complained to John Pointon and Sons, the area's biggest animal rendering plant. Company officials are now investigating whether the truck was heading to their plant. Technical director Barney Williams said: 'We are taking this issue very seriously and carrying out our own investigation. 'We leak-test our vehicles to make sure animal by-products are contained. 'They are all covered and have to be of a Defra-approved standard. I have not had an incident like this in the 10 years I have been with the company.' Councillor Gill Heath, cabinet support member for environment and rural issues, said: 'This was a very unpleasant experience for the pupils and should not have happened. 'There are strict controls covering the transportation, disposal and processing of animal by-products, which should always be carried in leak-proof vehicles. 'We are aware of the reports and are investigating.' The girls were waiting for the bus in Weston Coyney in Stoke when they were showered. It's though 17 trucks-full of animal waste were driven down the road on one day .

"A medieval sword found buried under a birch tree in Siberia may have belonged to Ivan the Terrible, archaeologists have claimed. The rare 12th century blade, discovered in 1975 and nicknamed Siberia's Excalibur, was found three kilometres from where the lieutenant of a Cossack leader favoured by the tsar is thought to have died. Until now the sword had been considered a spoil of war, but a new theory suggests it could have may have been a gift from the leader to Ermak Timofeyevich, and passed along to Ivan Koltso. The sword discovered beneath a birch tree in Siberia may have belonged to the ruthless Russian tsar, Ivan the Terrible, whose armies conquered the area in the 1500s . Koltso, who died in battle in 1583, may have even used the blade in the fight for Siberia. Latin letters engraved on the weapon mean 'In the name of the mother of our savour, eternal Lord and Saviour. Christ Jesus Christ.' The reverse side reads: 'In the name of the Almighty. The Mother of God. In the name of Eternal.' It was uncovered at the base of a tree in the Baraba forest-steppe, less than three kilometres from where it is thought Koltso died in battle in 1583. He was declared a hero by Ivan the Terrible, Russian most fearsome tsar, with church bells ringing out in Moscow. In a new hypothesis, Academician Vyacheslav Molodin suggests the blade 'could have been taken from Ivan the Terrible's armoury and brought here by the legendary warrior Ivan Koltso,' reports The Siberian Times. 'Imagine the last battle of the Cossack detachment headed by Ivan Koltso,' he said. The sword, discovered in 1975, is a 12th century blade thought to have been made in Germany and Sweden. It is possible it was gifted to the leader of the Cossack army by the tsar in the 14th century . When unearthed by the archaeologist in the 1970s, the sword was 'incredibly well preserved', he said . Letters on the blade mean 'In the name of the Almighty. The Mother of God. In the name of Eternal' Mr Molodin said he had seen swords of the same kind in museums and books but never in real life . The archaeologist was worried the metal would fall apart after going untouched for hundreds of years . 'The attack was unexpected. Picture someone immediately being killed by a treacherous stab in the back, and somebody else grabbing a sword to fight the advancing Tatars. 'They are unequal forces and the Cossacks are trying to break through the crowds of enemies, but the ranks of the fighters are melting rapidly. 'Ivan strikes not one opponent. In his hands, the glittering giant sword, a gift from the Russian Tsar. 'In desperation Ivan and a few survivors of the Cossacks literally hack their way to their waiting horses. 'Ivan's leg is already in the stirrup and he is racing on the steppe, with his horse taking him further from the bloody battle. 'Behind him they chase, with arrows flying. And then, suddenly, the sword falls out of the hands of the hero and drops to the ground under a young birch tree. 'I am not sure that I am right, imagining all this, but the legend is really beautiful.' He stressed he is not yet ready to advance the theory in a scientific publication but 'we should not exclude the version that the sword could have got to Baraba together with Yermak's squadrons. An illustration of Ermak Timofeyevich, the famed Cossack leader conquering Siberia with Ivan's army . Mr Molodin said he is not ready to put his hypothesis forward in a publication yet but is developing the theory . 'Despite his Cossacks having sabres and firearms, they were still using swords. So it was quite possible they were using them during that trip'. It was during a dig led by Molodin that the sword was unearthed decades ago. 'It took us an hour to clear the soil completely to see a massive sword, about a metre long with a typical iron hilt of medieval knight's swords with a clearly expressed crossbar guard and tripartite pommel,' he said. 'It was incredibly well-preserved, yet I was scared to raise it from the ground. I was scared it would fall into pieces in my hands. 'Finally I put my thin bladed knife underneath the sword and raised it. 'I've seen swords like this in museums and in scientific books, but it was my first time ever to hold it in my hands. 'It was as if it just descended from some knights' fairy tale. 'I slowly twisted it, noting sparkles of silver on the guard and blade. It was so well preserved that you could in fact use it in the battle almost straight away.' Crowned in Moscow in 1547, Ivan the Terrible would become known as one of the most ruthless rulers in history, slaughtering thousands in his final years at the helm of the Kremlin and well as killing his own son. Born Ivan Chetvyorty Vasilyevich on August 25, 1530, he was orphaned at the age of 8 and developed a deep distaste for the rival noble families  to whom he attributed his mother's death. After declaring himself the first tsar of Russia, he embarked on a destructive campaign to gain sole control over the growing empire. His power multiplied upon Russia's conquering of Sibera, Kazan and Astrakhan, and a centrally-controlled Russian state was created. Under his rule, the structure for Governments created centuries later was created. However a successful leader, he was deeply unpopular and detested for his cruel leadership methods. Following the death of his first wife, Ivan is said to have developed severe paranoia and depression. His ruthlessness was such he beat his pregnant daughter-in-law into having a miscarriage, killed his own son in a fit of rage and blinded the architect of St Basil's Cathedral so that he may never recreate something so beautiful. He died in 1584 of an apparent stroke, leaving Russia in the hands of his son, Feodor.","Medieval sword may have been gift from the tsar to Cossack leader .

"Makeup is a precise mask used to subtly enhance features and hide blemishes. For kids, it is a whole other world of excitement. A group of mothers handed over the lipstick, blusher, mascara, foundation and nail varnish to their daughters aged three to six. And the results were spectacular. Abstract: Ashley Donoghue sports one entirely pink hand and colored streaks painted by three-year-old Aavie . Not so precise: Kristi Tetzlaff forwent her usual mascara for five-year-old Brooklyn's unusual makeover . Striking: Jill Clapton's four-year-old daughter Taze opted for a few streaks of black and purple for her mother .

"It will be the focal event of next week's Opening Ceremony. But the lighting of the Olympic Flame is in danger of being overshadowed by the petty squabble between two of Britain's greatest Olympians about who deserves the honour. Daley Thompson and Sir Steve Redgrave have each questioned the other's credentials to be the one to light the fire to launch London 2012. Yesterday double-gold winning decathlete Daley Thompson implied that rowing was much easier than his own specialism of track and field, adding that Sir Steve was ‘not in the same class’ as his friend Sebastian Coe. Who is the greatest? Daley Thompson (left) said that rower Sir Steve Redgrave (right) was . 'not in the same class' as his friend Sebastian Coe . The pair are said to have always had a . lukewarm relationship, so eyebrows were raised when they were both . named as favourites to light the cauldron at the opening ceremony. It emerged that former runner Lord Coe, chairman of organisers Locog, had been pushing for his long-time friend Thompson to do the honours on July 27, over the bookies’ favourite Sir Steve. Yesterday, when asked about any rivalry between Lord Coe and Sir Steve, Thompson said: ‘Why would there be rivalry? In my opinion Sebastian Coe is the second greatest Olympian, after myself. ‘Steve Redgrave is not in the same class as Seb Coe. He is a rower, but I think track and field is the toughest sport in the Olympics, which means the rewards are greater.’ Contentious: It emerged that Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of organisers Locog, had been pushing for his long-standing friend Thompson to do the honours at the opening ceremony . Asked if Sir Steve was one of the . obvious choices to light the torch as a five-times Olympian, Thompson . said: ‘I don’t think so. It depends on your opinion. Who should light the Olympic flame? Who should light the Olympic flame? Now share your opinion . ‘Without knowing the criteria or who is making the decision, it’s impossible for me to say who should light the flame.’ In an article in the Evening Standard newspaper two weeks ago, Sir Steve wrote: ‘Obviously, Daley was a great athlete. Some people, Seb Coe included, think he’s the best athlete ever. 'My personal view is that he doesn’t make the top five of great British Olympians. I’d put Seb above him, and Kelly Holmes, certainly Ben Ainslie, and, all modesty aside, myself and Matt Pinsent. ‘I say that because, to me, athletes compete at the decathlon if they are great all-rounders instead of being supreme in one event.’ Rapid rower: Sir Steve Redgrave holds his hand aloft in a salute to the British support at Sydney after winning his fifth consecutive gold medal . Coe and Thompson both won the first of their two Olympic golds in Moscow in 1980 – Coe in the 1,500 metres and Thompson in the decathlon. They both won gold again four years later in Los Angeles, the Games at which Sir Steve won the first of his five gold medals. He went on to win gold in Seoul, Barcelona, Atlanta in the Coxless Pair discipline and Sydney in the Coxless Four. Olympics . World Championships . Commonwealth Games . Olympics . World Championships . Commonwealth Games . Traditionally it has always been track and field athletes to light the cauldron, with a few exceptions. But no rower has ever taken the responsibility. Lord Coe has no direct power over who will light the cauldron, but Locog chief executive Paul Deighton is one of the key decision-makers. Lord Coe has previously joked that Thompson should perform the lighting ‘because he is my mate’, adding: ‘I also do actually happen to believe he is the greatest Olympian we have delivered.’ However, this week he said the decision may not be made until the day itself.

"Hospitals are to hire Eastern European nurses because so many patients cannot speak English, making it hard for doctors to understand their health concerns. For the first time, NHS trusts in immigration hotspots want to recruit staff from Poland to cope with the language barriers they face every day on their wards. It is hoped the move will improve care for foreign-born patients, cut the Health Service’s £23 million annual bill for translation services, and reduce the lengthy consultation times clinicians must have with non-English speakers. NHS managers want to recruit Polish staff, pictured, to cut down on the service's translation service bill . However, critics say it highlights the strain placed on health care by Britain’s open borders policy over the past decade. New figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to confirm this week that migration to the UK last year was far higher than the Government target of the ‘tens of thousands’. Official figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show there are already 2,473 nurses from Poland working in Britain, with 210 registering in the past year alone. But for the first time it can be revealed that hospitals are also recruiting foreign staff because they will be better able to communicate with patients. The first trust to speak openly of the plan is in Boston, Lincolnshire, which has a larger proportion of Eastern European residents than anywhere else in Britain. Census figures show one in ten of the town’s 64,000 population is from new members of the EU such as Poland or Latvia, and the high birth rate among recent arrivals puts strain on maternity services as well as interpreters. Garry Marsh, deputy chief nurse of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, said: ‘We have a big Eastern European community and the health needs of that population will grow as they age within the UK.’ He added: ‘By looking at recruiting from Eastern European counties, we would introduce nurses that culturally are very responsive to those patients’ needs – the most obvious and immediate barrier we face being the language differences.’ The United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, pictured, has been paying translators £38-an-hour . The trust has 36 nursing places to fill and senior staff are expected to travel to Poland early next year to carry out interviews, having gone on a similar recruiting trip to Greece. A spokesman declined to answer questions about the current number of Eastern European patients it cares for or how many existing staff members are Polish. Figures showed the trust spent £57,000 on language services in 2011-12, up from £45,000 two years earlier. As well as translating leaflets into Polish, the hospital has to hire £38-an-hour interpreters so doctors can understand patients’ problems and be sure they understand treatment being offered. In Norfolk, hospital bosses are also considering hiring foreign nurses. A spokesman for Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Trust said: ‘Recruiting Eastern European nurses is under consideration but there are no plans at this moment to do so.’ Interviews have also been held in Krakow, Poland, to find foreign nurses to fill staffing gaps at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.","Hospitals are paying translators £38-an-hour to interpret for patients .
There are now almost 2,500 nurses from Poland working in the NHS .

"After backlash from customers, the producer of Maker’s Mark bourbon is reversing a decision to cut the amount of alcohol in bottles of its famous whiskey. Rob Samuels, Maker’s Mark’s chief operating officer, said Sunday that it is restoring the alcohol volume of its product to its historic level of 45 per cent, or 90 proof. Last week, it said it was lowering the amount to 42 per cent, or 84 proof, because of a supply shortage. Change of plans: The producer of Maker¿s Mark bourbon is reversing a decision to cut the amount of alcohol in bottles of its famous whiskey after facing backlash from customers . One of the oldest and largest conventions of its kind in the country opened Saturday and will run through February 18. In the 1990s, the problem was the government crowding out the private sector. Today, the problem is the government crowding out itself. ‘We’ve been tremendously humbled over the last week or so,’ Samuels, grandson of the brand’s founder, said of customers’ reactions. The brand known for its square bottles sealed in red wax has struggled to keep up with demand. Distribution has been squeezed, and the brand had to curtail shipments to some overseas markets. In a tweet Sunday, the company said to its followers: ‘You spoke. We listened.’ Fans of the whiskey applauded the move and questioned why the company moved to change in the first place. ‘Some things you just got to leave alone,’ Todd Matthews, 42, of Livingston, Tennessee, said.Company officials said much customer feedback came from Twitter and Facebook. On those sites, comments on Sunday’s change of course ranged from angry to celebratory to self-congratulatory. The statement on Maker’s Mark’s Facebook page drew more than 14,000 'likes' and 2,200 comments within two hours of Sunday’s announcement. The change in recipe started with a shortage of the bourbon amid an ongoing expansion of the company’s operations that cost tens of millions of dollars. Maker’s Mark Chairman Emeritus Bill Samuels, the founder’s son, said the company focused almost exclusively on not altering the taste of the bourbon while stretching the available product and didn’t consider the emotional attachment that customers have to the brand and its composition. Back to normal: Rob Samuels, Maker's Mark's chief operating officer, said Sunday that it is restoring the alcohol volume of its product to its historic level of 45 per cent, or 90 proof . Bill Samuels said the company tinkered with how much water to add and keep the taste the same for about three months before making the announcement about the change Monday. It marked the first time the bourbon brand, more than a half-century old, had altered its proof or alcohol volume. ‘Our focus was on the supply problem. That led to us focusing on a solution,’ Bill Samuels said. ‘We got it totally wrong.’ Both Bill and Rob Samuels said customer reaction was immediate. Company officials heard from ‘thousands and thousands of consumers’ that a bourbon shortage was preferable to a change in how the spirits were made, Bill Samuels said. ‘They would rather put up with the occasional supply shortage than put up with any change in their hand-made bourbon,’ Rob Samuels said. The change in alcohol volume called for the recipe and process to stay the same, except for a ‘touch more water’ to be added when the whiskey comes out of the barrel for bottling, Rob Samuels said. When production restarts Monday, those plans are off the table, Bill Samuels said. ‘We really made this decision after an enormous amount of thought, and we focused on the wrong things,’ Bill Samuels said. Maker’s Mark is owned by spirits company Beam Inc., based in Deerfield, Illinois. Its other brands include Jim Beam bourbon. Maker’s is made at a distillery near the small town of Loretto, 45 miles south of Louisville.Its bourbon ages in barrels for at least six summers and no longer than seven years before bottling. The supply shortage at Maker’s comes amid growing demand for Kentucky bourbons in general. Combined Kentucky bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales from producers or suppliers to wholesalers rose 5.2 per cent to 16.9 million cases last year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, a national trade association that released figures last week. Revenue shot up 7.3 per cent to $2.2 billion, it said. Premium brands, generally made in smaller batches with heftier prices, led sales and revenue gains. Kentucky produces 95 per cent of the world’s bourbon supply, according to the Kentucky Distillers’ Association. There are 4.9 million bourbon barrels aging in Kentucky, which outnumbers the state’s population.

"A strong earthquake struck a ski resort that hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics, flattening homes and injuring more than 22 people. The magnitude-6.8 earthquake rocked a mountainous area of central Japan near Nagano city shortly after 10pm on Saturday, leaving three people with serious injuries. It struck at a depth of six miles and destroyed at least 10 homes at the Hakuba ski resort, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. At least 21 people were trapped underneath collapsed houses, but they all were rescued by police, with two of them suffering injuries. Scroll down for video . A strong earthquake struck Hakuba ski resort near Nagano city in central Japan on Saturday night . The magnitude-6.8 earthquake destroyed at least 10 homes in the resort and caused travel disruption . This came just hours after a deadly earthquake rocked southwestern China late Saturday afternoon, killing at least one woman. The US Geological Survey measured the quake's magnitude at 6.2 in Japan, but since it occurred inland, there should be the no possibility of a tsunami. Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority said no abnormalities were reported at three nuclear power plants in the affected areas. It struck at a depth of six miles and 21 people were trapped underneath the collapsed houses . Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority said no abnormalities were reported at three nuclear power plants . All of Japan's nuclear plants are offline following a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and massive tsunami in 2011 that sent three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant into meltdown. Fukushima is about 155 miles northeast of where Saturday's earthquake occurred. 'We are trying to assess the situation as quickly as possible, and we'll do our utmost for the rescue of the injured people,' Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters. One of the hardest-hit areas was ski town  Hakuba, as at least 10 homes collapsed there, according to Shigeharu Fujimura, a Nagano prefecture disaster management official. Many houses also lost water because of a ruptured pipe and landslides on two major roads blocked access to some areas. Cracks appeared on major roads and landslides blocked several busy routes in the mountainous area . The impact was felt across much of northern Japan and in Tokyo, around 125 miles southeast of Hakuba . 'We are afraid there could be some areas that may have been isolated, so we need to conduct a thorough assessment of damage after sunrise,' Fujimura said. Ryo Nishino, a restaurant owner in Hakuba, told Japanese broadcaster NHK that he had 'never experienced a quake that shook so hard. The sideways shaking was enormous.' He was in the restaurant's wine cellar when the earthquake struck. It was felt across much of northern Japan and in Tokyo, around 125 miles southeast of Hakuba. All shinkansen bullet train systems in the region were temporarily suspended and the quake caused scattered blackouts, including about 1,600 homes in Hakuba and Omachi city. The earthquake was followed by 21 aftershocks, said Yohei Hasegawa of the Meteorological Agency's earthquake and tsunami division. He warned of further aftershocks and urged residents to watch out for landslides. A local community centre was badly damaged after the strong earthquake hit the ski resort town .

"Detectives investigating suspected terrorists and paedophiles will have the power to force internet companies to hand over details of computer-users under new laws being introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May. The move is the latest round in a power battle between Mrs May and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over the so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’, which would greatly increase the power of the police and intelligence services to monitor communications between suspects. Last night, Mrs May said the move would boost national security, but complained that Mr Clegg was still blocking her from taking further vital steps on the grounds of civil liberties. Scroll down for video . Power battle: Home Secretary Theresa May has clashed with Nick Clegg over the so-called 'snooper's charter' But the Lib Dems hit back, saying there was ‘no chance’ of any ‘illiberal’ measures being allowed on to the statute book. Under the Home Secretary’s plans, to be included in the Anti-Terrorism and Security Bill, internet service providers will be obliged to help police and MI5 track suspicious individuals by retaining information that helps them match Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to individual users. IP addresses are numbers that identify each device connected to the internet. If police seize a computer that has been shared between individuals, they will be able to demand the information that will single out the key suspects. It will also allow them to track anyone using websites showing child-abuse images. But despite Mrs May’s lobbying, police still cannot demand that internet companies tell them which websites were being viewed by suspects. The move comes just days after Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, Scotland Yard’s head of counter-terrorism, said the ‘massively stretched’ police were forced to rely on old-fashioned methods such as following suspects because the targets were finding it easier to evade electronic monitoring. Mrs May said: ‘Loss of the capabilities on which we have always relied is the great danger we face. The Bill provides the opportunity to resolve the very real problems that exist around IP resolution and is a step in the right direction towards bridging the overall communications data capability gap. But I believe we need to make further changes to the law. ‘It is a matter of national security and we must keep on making the case for the Communications Data Bill until we get the changes we need.’ Internet giants were asked at a Downing Street summit last month to hand over the personal details of extremists they catch posting offensive material online, such as beheading videos . An aide to Mr Clegg said he supported the move on IP addresses, but continued to oppose plans to allow the security services to access records of every website visited by targets and who they communicate with on social media sites. The aide also accused Mrs May of previously making ‘deeply misleading’ claims that the Lib Dems had ‘put children’s lives at risk’ by blocking the ‘snoopers’ charter’. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It is good news that the Home Office has finally got round to producing proposals on this after being repeatedly asked by Nick Clegg. These can now be agreed and acted on in the upcoming Bill. ‘This is exactly the kind of thing we need to take action on, rather than proposing an unnecessary, unworkable and disproportionate snoopers’ charter. There is absolutely no chance of that illiberal Bill coming back under the Coalition Government – it’s dead and buried.’ As The Mail on Sunday disclosed, internet giants were asked at a Downing Street summit last month to hand over the personal details – including IP addresses – of extremists they catch posting offensive material online, such as beheading videos.","Detectives will have the power to force internet companies to hand over details under new laws .

The nurses gathered around Mariano Rajoy's motorcade at the end of his visit to the Carlos III hospital to protest at the government's handling of the case of Teresa Romero. The nurse, is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside of Africa, after becoming infected by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease as she treated him at the Carlos III Hospital. Scroll down for video . Spanish health workers throw latex gloves at the motorcade of the prime minister Mariano Rajoy today outside the Carlos III hospital in Madrid . The protest comes amid reports staff at the hospital are working under stressful conditions as some stay away from work . She is said to be in a serious but stable condition and has being described as at 'serious risk' of dying by Madrid's regional leader. The protest comes after it was reported staff were working under stressful conditions at the hospital as some nurses stay away from work, fearful they might catch the deadly virus. One of the nurses caring for Mrs Romero, Charly Manuel Torres, told AFP: 'There are fewer staff signing up to help by providing voluntary extra cover at the hospital. 'We are very stressed. We are working under a lot of pressure.' Some health workers are reportedly calling in sick with some even resigning so they don't have to go to the hospital . Health workers' unions have also said that the protective equipment that they have been provided with is substandard . According to other reports, medical workers have been calling in sick with some even formally resigning from their posts. Meanwhile health workers' unions say training and equipment at the Carlos III hospital were insufficient to deal with the deadly Ebola crisis. Health professionals have blamed substandard equipment and protective suits for the infection spreading. Nurses threw the latex gloves towards the prime minister's motorcade earlier this afternoon . Carlos III hospital specialises in infectious diseases but parts have been closed at a time of public spending cuts . The hospital also specialises in infectious diseases but parts of it were recently closed at a time of public spending cuts. But after visiting the Carlos III hospital where the infected nurse lay, the prime minister said the situation was 'complex and difficult,' but he was 'absolutely convinced' everything necessary would be done to beat the crisis. The deputy premier Soraya Saenz de Santamria also told a news conference the government was working 'to give the best care possible to Teresa Romero, to transmit calm to the population and to coordinate our actions.' Ms Saenz said she herself would head the new committee, which will bring together Health Minister Ana Mato and representatives of various other ministries. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, giving a press conference outside the Carlos III hospital in Madrid . Teresa Romero, the Spanish nurse who has been infected with Ebola. She has been described as gravely ill but in a stable condition . It comes after seven people turned themselves in to an Ebola isolation unit in Madrid yesterday, where Mrs Romero is being cared for. The seven new admissions included two hairdressers who had given Romero a beauty treatment before she was diagnosed with Ebola, and hospital staff who had treated the 44-year-old nurse. A hospital spokeswoman said there were now 14 people in the isolation unit on its sealed-off sixth floor. Among them were Mrs Romero's, her husband, and health workers who had cared for her since she was admitted on Monday. Two doctors who treated her have been admitted for precautionary observation, while two nurses who worked alongside Mrs Romero Ramos are also in quarantine. One of the doctors has complained that the sleeves on his protective suit were too short. It has also been alleged that the nurse found out she had the virus through a media report, while looking at her mobile phone. Doctors wearing protective suits inside the Madrid hospital, where nurse Teresa Romero is being treated . Unions have accused the government of seeking to deflect the blame on to Mrs Romero for the failings of its health system . Spanish labour unions accused the government of seeking to deflect the blame on to Mrs Romero for the failings of its health system, after the European Union asked Spain to explain how the virus could have been spread on a high-security ward. The top regional health official in Madrid, Javier Rodriguez, has said Mrs Romero took too long to admit she had made a mistake by touching her face with the glove of her protective suit while taking it off. In a radio interview he said: 'She has taken days to recognise that she may have made a mistake when taking off the suit. If she had said it earlier, it would have saved a lot of work. But the nurse's brother Jose Ramon told the newspaper El Pais: 'They will find any way to blame her. Basically, my sister did her job ... and she has become infected with Ebola.' The anger also comes amid an investigation into a possible lapse in health safety protocol led, which led to Mrs Romero being infected and why it took a week for medics to admit her to hospital.","Health workers jeered and threw gloves at Mariano Rajoy on his visit .

Shaykh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi, formerly Imam of the Grand Umayyad . Mosque in Damascus, who flew in from Washington DC to deliver the eulogy. 'He took every risk in order to help the Syrian people, to . remove some of their tragedy, to offer them some relief,' al-Yaqoubi said. He called Kassig 'one of our brothers who . sacrificed his life for the sake of God.' He offered condolences to Ed and Paula Kassig, Peter's parents, calling their son a . great hero 'who carried in his heart the principles of Islam . even before becoming a Muslim.' Al-Yaqoubi used the occasion to denounce Kassig's murderers, calling them 'terrorists' and declaring that their violent actions go against everything Islam stands for. ‘The question is, is this Islam? Definitely not. Does this group belong to Islam? No, it does not…. Islam is a religion of love, mercy and peace and... encouraging killing is not Islamic,’ he told the audience, according to The Indianapolis Star. ‘Islam and human rights can never clash. God does not preach hatred. God is against oppression,’ reported WTHR. Al-Yaqoubi promised the extremists who took Kassig's life 'hellfire for every crime their commit.' The prominent Syrian cleric thanked Peter/Abdul-Rahman for his 'great deeds' and 'acts of championship.' ‘When he went there he knew there were all these risk. He went against all odds showing every type of bravery this is why he’ll be remembered,’ said al-Yaqoubi.

"A female gray wolf from the Northern Rockies traveled hundreds of miles into northern Arizona, marking the species' first appearance in the region in more than 70 years and the farthest journey south, wildlife officials confirmed Friday. A wolf-like animal had been spotted roaming the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and the adjacent national forest since last month. Biologists collected its scat and sent it to a University of Idaho laboratory for testing, verifying what environmentalists had suspected based on its appearance and a radio collar around its neck. This photo from the Arizona Game and Fish Department shows a gray wolf that was spotted north of the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona. Wildlife officials have confirmed the presence of the first gray wolf in northern Arizona in more than 70 years. 'The corroboration is really good to get,' said Michael Robinson of the Center for Biological Diversity. Biologists don't know the wolf's age or from where it traveled. The radio collar wasn't transmitting a signal, and cold weather forced biologists to suspended efforts to capture the animal and replace the collar. The Idaho lab might be able to glean more details about the wolf from its DNA, but U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Jeff Humphrey said that could take several weeks or months. 'We'll let this wolf be a wolf where it's at, and if it decides it's going to move back north, it can do that,' he said. 'Or if somebody joins her, then that's nature taking its course.' Analysis of the animal's scat shows it's from a Northern Rockies population. The wolf is believed to have traveled at least 450 miles into northern Arizona, where it's been spotted at the Grand Canyon and the adjacent forest . Wolves often roam vast distances in search of food and mates. But the farther they go, the less likely they are to find a mate, said Ed Bangs, who led recovery efforts for wolves in the Northern Rockies over two decades before retiring from the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2011. 'It's looking for love,' he said. 'It leaves the core population and doesn't know the love of its life is going to be right over the next hill, so it just keeps traveling.' About 25 percent of the roughly 1,700 wolves from the Northern Rockies are being tracked, wildlife officials said. They are distinguished from the Mexican gray wolves found in the Southwest by their more full bodies and less pointed ears. Mike Jimenez with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Wyoming said Northern Rockies gray wolves are hard-wired to disperse and have traveled hundreds of miles. One young female started off in Montana and traveled 3,000 miles over six months, making stops in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Colorado before it died, he said. Colorado had been the farthest journey south for the animals until the female was confirmed in Arizona, he said. Wolves from another major population in the western Great Lakes have likewise been found far from home. Wolves largely were exterminated early last century across the lower 48 states, except in the western Great Lakes area. The Northern Rockies population was restored after 66 gray wolves from Canada were relocated to central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in the mid-1990s. They've been absent from the Grand Canyon region since the 1940s. The Fish and Wildlife Service in recent years lifted federal protections for the animals in the western Great Lakes and the Northern Rockies. A federal judge recently ordered the protections re-instated in Wyoming after wildlife advocates sued. Environmentalists are pressing for continued protection of gray wolves. Meanwhile, they celebrated the news of the one in northern Arizona. 'I wonder if she has any sense of the celebrity she has achieved,' said Drew Kerr of WildEarth Guardians.","A gray wolf was recently photographed on the north rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona .
Any wolf roaming near the  Canyon would be protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act .

"Five people who had suffered severe strokes (illustrated) regained the power of speech and mobility thanks to a radical new treatment . Stroke patients have shown remarkable signs of recovery after they were given a radical new treatment. Five people who had suffered severe strokes regained the power of speech, use of their arms and legs and improved cognition after just six months, according to British research published today. The three men and two women, aged between 45 and 75, were treated with stem cells extracted from their own bone marrow in the first experiment of its kind. The treatment, developed by scientists at Imperial College in London, is thought to be so effective because it triggers the rapid regeneration of brain cells that are damaged during a stroke. More than 150,000 people have a stroke in England every year, with patients suffering paralysis, speech problems and personality changes. Many never recover their independence. Scientists cautioned that the new treatment is at a very early stage, and said it needs to be tested on thousands more people before it can be declared a complete success, but they said the results show great potential to revolutionise life for stroke patients. Dr Soma Banerjee, who led the research, said: ‘Obviously this is just a pilot study with five patients, but it is very exciting and certainly a spring board for more research to take this further. ‘This is the first step in translating the basic science to the bedside for our patients. ‘There were significant improvements in all our patients in neurological and clinical terms.’ Each of the five test patients had suffered severe ischemic strokes, in which an artery feeding blood to the brain had become blocked. When this happens the brain cells are starved of oxygen and can die, causing severe motor impairments including drooping faces, paralysed legs and arms, and problems with eating and talking. Out of the five patients, four had suffered the very worst category of stroke - a total anterior circulation stroke, in which the entire blood supply to the front of one side of the brain is cut off. The prognosis for people who have this kind of stroke is usually poor - around 50 per cent die within six months, and another 46 per cent are left dependent on others. Only 4 per cent recover enough to live independently. The treatment, developed by scientists at Imperial College in London, is thought to be so effective because it triggers the rapid regeneration of brain cells that are damaged during a stroke (illustrated). More than 150,000 people have a stroke in England every year, suffering paralysis and speech problems . Three men and two women, aged between 45 and 75, were treated with stem cells extracted from their own bone marrow. They had all suffered severe ischemic strokes, in which an artery feeding blood to the brain had become blocked. The . therapy uses stem cells called CD34+ - a set of stem cells in the bone . marrow that encourages the regeneration of blood cells and blood . vessels. A bone marrow sample was taken from the hip seven days after a stroke and the stem cells were isolated. The cells were then injected, via an artery in their groin, directly into the brain. The treatment triggers the rapid regeneration of brain cells damaged in a stroke. In the trial, three out of four patients regained enough control over their bodies to live independently within six months. They were able to wash, dress, eat, drink, look after their bodily functions, as well as walking. The . treatment is at an early stage and needs years of testing before it . could be offered as a standard treatment for stroke victims. In the trial, however, three out of four - 75 per cent - had regained enough control over their bodies to live independently within six months. Dr Banerjee said: ‘They were able to walk and able to look after themselves. ‘They were able to wash, dress, eat, drink, look after their bodily functions, as well as walking. They were independent.’ The remarkable results, however described in the journal Stem Cells Translational Medicine, come with many caveats. The experiment was only set up to establish that the treatment was safe - which it did - but five patients are not enough to show that it is truly effective. The therapy uses stem cells called CD34+ - a set of stem cells in the bone marrow that encourages the regeneration of blood cells and blood vessels. Previous research has shown that treatment using these cells can significantly improve recovery from stroke in animals. Rather than developing into brain cells themselves, the cells are thought to release chemicals that trigger the growth of new brain tissue and new blood vessels in the area damaged by stroke. The patients were treated within seven days of a severe stroke, in contrast to several other stem cell trials, most of which have treated patients after six months or later. After permission was obtained from the patient or their family, a bone marrow sample was taken from their hip and the stem cells were isolated. The cells were then injected, via an artery in their groin, directly into the brain. At least seven more years of testing are needed before it could reach hospitals, and thousands of patients will have to undergo the treatment before it is deemed a success. But scientists are excited about its . potential.Professor Nagy Habib who also worked on the research, said: . ‘These are early but exciting data worth pursuing. The therapy uses stem cells called CD34+ - a set of stem cells in the bone marrow (pictured) that encourages the regeneration of blood cells and blood vessels . Scientific evidence from our lab further supports the clinical findings and our aim is to develop a drug, based on the factors secreted by stem cells that could be stored in the hospital pharmacy so that it is administered to the patient immediately following the diagnosis of stroke in the emergency room. ‘This may diminish the minimum time to therapy and therefore optimise outcome. Now the hard work starts to raise funds for this exciting research.’ Dr Madina Kara, Neuroscientist at The Stroke Association, said: ‘This is one of the most exciting recent developments in stroke research; however, it’s still early days in stem cell research but the findings could lead to new treatments for stroke patients in the future.’ Dr Tim Chico, consultant cardiologist at the University of Sheffield, added: ‘It is important to understand that this study is only the very earliest step towards a possible new treatment for stroke and does not prove the stem cell treatment improved these patients’ recovery. ‘A much larger trial will be needed to compare stem cell treatment with no stem cell treatment. Anyone who has seen the suffering a stroke can cause will be encouraged that doctors and scientists are continually exploring new ways to treat this devastating disease.’","5 stroke victims were treated with stem cells extracted from bone marrow .

"A teacher won his battle with Vodafone yesterday after a thief stole his mobile phone and ran up a £15,000 bill. Osian Rhys Edwards, 29, called the mobile company immediately to cancel his phone when it was pickpocketed while he was on holiday in Barcelona. But weeks later he was shocked to receive the huge bill - racked up in just a few hours calling premium rate lines. Osian Rhys Edwards was told to pay the £15,000 bill despite claiming to report his phone stolen on the night of the theft . Pickpockets in the Catalan city target tourists and use their phones to place premium-rate calls before the handsets are blocked . Mr Edwards feared his life would be on hold for the 'next ten to 15 years' because of the crippling bill which he could not afford to pay. He also feared being blacklisted and unable to get credit and a mortgage because he has been forced to default on paying the bill. But a top lawyer took up his case for free and Vodafone have backed down. The company also dropped its bill demands against two other crime victims who had their phones stolen in Barcelona. Mr Edwards, of Barmouth, North Wales, said: 'It was clear that I was the victim of fraudsters but Vodafone wants to hold me responsible. The primary school teacher was originally told that the sum would be reduced to £10,000, but now Vodafone have relented and the bill has been wiped out . 'I can't believe that this is allowed to happen,' he said. 'I'm extremely grateful to the barrister who helped me. 'Most people aren't aware that it is possible to run up a £15,000 bill in just a few hours. 'Vodafone must have known I hadn't run up this bill but they are quite content to try to get me to pay it.' Mr Edwards is calling for capped bills to be brought in to stop others from falling victim of criminals racking up terrifying bills on stolen mobiles. A spokeswoman for Vodafone said it had waived Mr Edwards' bill following a 'comprehensive review of the case. Mr Rhys Edwards is the latest victim of pickpockets in the Catalan city who steal mobile phones and use them to place premium-rate calls in quick succession before the handset is blocked. Sarah Harvey, an NHS worker from Brighton, was told to settle a £5,800 bill run up after her phone was stolen in the same city. Georgia Harris, a recruitment worker, was initially told to pay £21,000 after her phone was stolen in 2013. Vodafone later withdrew its demand she pay for the foreign calls. In 2012, the telecoms regulator Ofcom ordered mobile phone companies produce plans to cap customers' bills. But the plans were never produced, and the issue was handed to the government with which companies are thought to be in continuing discussions.","Osian Rhys Edwards from Wales had phone stolen in Barcelona .

"In yet another classy PR stunt Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has launched the airline's new charity calendar by parading a line of half-dressed air hostesses through London. The gimmick came just days after the company's boss was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers. During the Twitter session the airline's flamboyant chief executive apologised for his firm's 'over-abrupt culture' and vowed to improve their image. Eleven of Ryanair's new calendar girls gave commuters a glimpse of what you can expect from the airline's charity calendar . The stunts are part of a drive to improve the public image of the airline, which was recently voted bottom of a 100-long list of brands by Which? readers. Announcing new 'family-friendly' deals Mr O'Leary said Ryanair was 'evolving' becoming 'more sophisticated'. But a line of half-naked women strutting their stuff through London's Victoria train station may not live up to the family-friendly image the airline is hoping to emulate. The stunt, which is all for a good cause, aims to raise more than £85,000 for Ryanair's nominated charity for 2014, the Teenage Cancer Trust. Since launching their first charity calendar the budget airline has raised nearly £600,000.

"Zoe Edwards, 38, chased a gang of youths in her 4x4 and shot them with a BB gun after they egged her conservatory in Worsley, Manchester . An angry mother-of-two chased down a gang of youths in her 4x4 while wearing pyjamas and shot them with a BB gun after they egged her conservatory. Zoe Edwards, 38, exploded into a rage after the teenagers attacked the back of her four-bedroom home in Worsley in Manchester, last Halloween. Wearing just her pyjamas, she got into her silver 4x4 and sped over a mile to confront the gang of between 10 and 15 boys, a court heard. Three of the teenagers said she sped towards them as they stood on Vicars Hall Lane in Boothstown, before winding down her window to shout and swear. Manchester Magistrates Court was told she fired some sort of BB gun, which hit one victim on the back and another on his rucksack. A post was later sent from her Facebook account to one of the boys saying: 'You can tell those spineless t***s you hang around with they are pathetic. Revenge is a b***h called Zoe.' Edwards, who is understood to work in management at a construction firm, denied being abusive or having any kind of weapon with her but admitted leaving her home to find out who had thrown eggs. She also denied sending the message and claimed instead that it was her son. On the allegations she said: 'I didn't do anything like that. I was scared as I realised I was on my own in my car and had come across these teenagers.' She was in tears in the witness box, as she added that her house, thought to be worth £305,000, had been targeted in egg attacks before and after the incident. The boys admitted they did not tell their parents about the attack until two or three days after the incident with one of them even apologising for the egg throwing to Edwards' husband Chris. Lee Bonner, defending, said this showed they had made up the story to pass on the blame for the 'nasty' egg attack. However, District Judge Mark Hadfield, rejected this account and found her guilty on two charges of assault and one of threatening behaviour. The gang of between 10 and 15 boys targeted the £305,000 four-bedroom house on Halloween last year . He said: 'I can understand you were angry and upset at having your house egged. 'I do find that you began pursuing them and that you discharged some form of implement which made contact with the back of the two complainants.' The case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. Speaking afterwards, solicitor Gareth Williams said his client was 'surprised' at the verdict. She jumped in her car and sped over a mile to Vicars Hall Lane where the boys claim she used a BB gun .","Zoe Edwards, 38, exploded into a rage after teenagers egged her home .

"A worker tasked with removing the Tower of London poppies bought for £25 each by thousands of well-wishers in support of charity has appeared to brag about stealing one in a Facebook post. Jo Maxwell claims the post in which she tells a friend she has taken one of the poppies for him was merely a joke. But Tower chiefs at Historic Royal Palace are said to have sacked the 30-year-old as the first batch of ceramic flowers is dispatched across the country. Scroll down for video . Jo Maxell posted a photograph on Facebook holding one of the 888,246 ceramic poppies and told a friend: 'I've got one for you'. The 30-year-old insists her post was a joke . 'Our inquiries are underway,' a spokesman for Historic Royal Parks, who run the popular tourist attraction, told the Sun. Ms Maxwell, a ski-worker, insisted she had not stolen one of the 888,246 poppies planted to represent each British soldier who died in WWI. Her comments, since removed from Facebook, were slammed by hundreds of people on the social media site. One fellow volunteer said even joking about stealing one of the poppies was 'disgraceful'. Thousands of people have begun dismantling Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red by artist Paul Cummins after the artwork was visited by around 4million since being unveiled in August. Each of the poppies has been bought in advance for £25, with a portion of all sales being donated to Armed Forces charities. Unscrupulous internet users attempted to flog their ceramic flowers online before they had even been distributed, with online auctioneers eBay forced to remove listings for the poppies at double their original price.

Earlier this week Mr Cummins revealed thieves had even attempted to break in to vans preparing to transport the poppies across the country. 'When they were taken out of the moat, people were breaking into the lorries to try to get them,’ he said. 'I am not happy.' ‘It is disrespectful to the people who bought them and made them and to the people they represent. ‘They have been trying to do this ever since we put them in. ‘So many people want them but we are not making any more, because I thought it would be disrespectful to the people who died.'","Jo Maxwell posted photograph holding poppy on her Facebook page .

"Anyone who has owned a cat knows that they most definitely like to feel in charge, and are quick to show their displeasure. So it is little wonder that these felines look decidedly unimpressed after their owners clipped and dyed them for a grooming competition. The world's largest grooming competition, Intergroom, is held every year in New Jersey, USA and features 2,000 of the world's best pet groomers from 23 different countries. Scroll down for video . This cat does NOT look pleased with the tiger clipped on its back, designed to look like the famous Cheetos Kitty . 'Big Boy' the cat looks grumpy after its owner transformed him into a Himalayan lion for the grooming competition . Owners spend weeks meticulously spraying and clipping their cats to perfect their designs, as in the case of this 'Scooby Doo' design . At the end of the three-day show participants are invited to show off their adventurous side in the creative grooming category. And they didn't disappoint this year with cats being made into lions, birds and dogs, amongst other things. The eccentric owners spend weeks meticulously spraying and clipping their cats to perfect their designs. Cat named 'Bird Stalker' has, in a slightly ironic twist, had beautiful patterns of three birds clipped and dyed into its fur . 'Martini' the winning cat in the creative grooming category had an intricate floral design on its back, with diamond crystals stuck on for extra sparkle . Professional photographer Paul Nathan, 43, who was at the event taking photos for his upcoming book, Groomed, said: 'They are all professional groomers who take this one opportunity a year to really be creative. 'Most of the work is completed before they arrive at the show as they have to be meticulous and spend weeks dying and snipping their cats. 'There is just so much detail and work involved as not one hair is out of place. 'There was a cat who had been turned into a lion but he didn't manage to look very fierce.'There was also a cat that had been turned into Scooby Doo - which looked good. Maritni is held by his doting owner who created the design, managing to scoop the top prize from 2,000 of the world's best pet groomers . Bird Stalker, here with his owner, is displayed inside a nest for maximum effect . 'I'm not a groomer myself and don't have a cat or a dog, but I just love the effort that goes into these competitions. 'I think the people involved have to be a little eccentric but in the nicest possible way. 'There are some people who may think this is a cruel thing to do, but any cat owned by a professional groomer is going to be fantastically well looked after . 'All of the dyes are non-toxic and the cats are obviously well looked after.'

"It didn’t just take dedication for Wendy Davis to filibuster the Texas state senate for 11 hours over an abortion bill: it also took a urinary catheter. After photos of her hot pink running shoes showed how she kept her feet from aching, and a shot of her donning a back brace to soothe her back surfaced, now comes this revelation of how the 50-year-old democrat stayed on the legislature floor and out of the ladies room for so long Tuesday. And her dedication didn’t even end there. Food and water are banned during filibusters, but rising star Davis was even deprived of the hard candy and ice chips normally provided to long-winded legislation blockers. V is for victory! Wendy Davis, Texas state senator from Ft. Worth, reacts to her successful filibuster in June. The democrat's victory may lead to Dewhurst's failure . At least according to Joel Burns, who knows Davis and told The Star-Telegram he watched the entire dramatic day on the Texas senate floor play out. The former single teen mom-turned-Harvard law school graduate became an overnight political star after pledging to block a bill that would have effectively shut down most of the Lone Star State’s abortion clinics and banned abortions after 20 weeks. As a midnight deadline to pass the legislation loomed and Davis continued to talk, political junkies from coast-to-coast tuned in via Internet, and the senator's followers on Twitter ballooned from around 1,200 to more than 79,000. As of Thursday afternoon, that number stood at over 100,000. Pro tips #1: Wear a back brace. Mrs Davis is helped into hers, which helped her stay upright for her 11-hour speech Tuesday on the Texas senate floor . Pro tip #2: Wear comfy shoes. Mrs Davis wore pink running shoes to prepare for the marathon session of speaking - for which she was not even allowed to lean against the table . Pro tip#3: Don't go to the bathroom, just use a urinary catheter, like this one. The bags act as a sort of external bladder and helped Mrs Davis to stay on the senate floor for 11 hours straight . Suddenly, photos of her Mizuno Women's Wave Rider 16 Running Shoes were everywhere, and customers began jamming online sales sites with such comments as the pair was ‘perfect for a filibuster.’ Even #StandWithWendy was trending. The makers of the ubiquitous Taiwanese animated re-enactments Next Media Animation even made a Wendy Davis video where the lawmaker flies into the senate wearing superhero spandex and high-fives the ghost of Anne Richards as coat hanger-wielding supporters cheer on their hero. It is a very odd ode to a rare moment where a Democrat in the deepest of red states was able to fend off, if just for a day, the efforts of a Republican majority. Obama's official Twitter account posted: ‘Something special is happening in Austin tonight.’ Similar messages of support came from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Other forms of support: Abortion-rights activists packed the Texas Senate gallery and objected loudly when Davis' Tuesday night filibuster was ended over a string of three rules violations . Davis' dedication and sudden surge in popularity come as no surprise to Texas Democrats, who chose her as the face of the battle to block the bill. ‘She's a total fighter,’ said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and daughter of the late former Texas Gov. Ann Richards. ‘And the thing about Sen. Davis, she says she's going to do something, she gets it done.’ Davis' filibuster ultimately ended as Republicans complained she had strayed off topic and cut her off. Fame: Davis' filibuster won her overnight fame, nearly 100,000 new Twitter followers and a coveted Taiwanese animation wherein she high-fives the ghost of Anne Richards . But that action prompted a lengthy debate with Democrats and deafening protests from hundreds of orange-clad abortion-rights activists in the gallery that spilled past the midnight deadline to kill all pending legislation. Even after she had stopped speaking, however, Davis continued to stand for more than an additional hour while her colleagues argued about whether her filibuster was really over. ‘Thanks to the powerful voices of thousands of Texans, #SB5 is dead,’ Davis tweeted Wednesday morning. ‘An incredible victory for Texas women and those who love them.’ Davis starting working at age 14 to help support a household of her single mother and three siblings. By 19, she was already married and divorced with a child of her own. After community college, she graduated from Texas Christian University before being accepted to Harvard Law School. She returned to Texas to become a Fort Worth City Council member before upsetting an incumbent Republican for a seat in the state Senate. ‘We knew about her on the City Council,’ said Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston. ‘And we knew her track record as someone you could count on in the heat of battle.’ The victory may be short-lived, though. On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Perry called a second special session beginning . July 1, giving the Republican majority in the statehouse another 30 days . to re-ignite the abortion debate - and likely finish the job this time. Small victory? Though Davis' fame may be lasting her victory will likely not be. He's called for a July 1 special session to push the bill through . Davis narrowly retained her Senate seat during elections last year, but her victory allowed the Democrats to hold 12 of the chamber's 31 seats, just enough to block contentious bills from coming to the floor. She is up for re-election again in 2014, though Democratic operatives have already begun a whisper campaign urging her to run for governor. A Democrat has not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, but those whispers are sure to get louder now. An email from Battleground Texas, a much-ballyhooed effort by former Obama campaign veterans to energize Latino voters and turn the state blue, read Wednesday: ‘Last night an incredible thing happened. Wendy Davis stood up to Texas Republicans.’ But she soon likely sat down. ‘My back hurts,’ Davis said when it was over. ‘I don't have a lot of words left. Work it out: Davis has a stretch during her successful 11-hour filibuster, which was helped along by comfortable shoes, a back brace, and a urinary catheter .","The revelation explains the Texas Democrat's remarkable ability to stay on the senate floor and out of the ladies room .
Davis, and her accessories, managed to block Tuesday's abortion bill vote but Gov. Rick Perry vowed Thursday to pass it in a special session July 1 ."
"NHS bosses have launched an official investigation into whether the closure of two A&Es triggered long waits at nearby hospitals – just days after The Mail on Sunday highlighted the problem. Dr Mark Spencer, the GP in charge of the huge hospital reorganisation in North-West London, said he was ordering the inquiry because he was ‘not happy’ with A&E performance at Northwick Park and Ealing hospitals, following the closure of two other London units in September. The surprise decision comes after repeated denials by NHS managers that closing A&Es around the country has a ‘domino effect’ on other emergency departments. NHS bosses have launched an official investigation into whether the closure of two A&Es triggered long waits at nearby hospitals – just days after The Mail on Sunday highlighted the problem (file picture) The probe will look at whether the controversial closures of A&Es at Central Middlesex and Hammersmith hospitals caused lengthy delays at nearby casualties – and led to a spike in death rates. This paper has discovered numerous instances of A&E closures having a knock-on impact elsewhere – leading to longer waits for emergency care, wards bursting at the seams, and more operations being cancelled. Last Sunday, we told how patients at Northwick Park and Ealing have faced the longest A&E waits in England this autumn, following the double closure ten weeks ago. Since then, a quarter of A&E patients at these two hospitals have had to wait more than four hours for treatment. That is more than double the comparable figure from the same period last autumn. Last week a spokesman for London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Northwick Park in Harrow, and Ealing hospitals, told us the increase in A&E activity there was ‘certainly not unique’. Last Sunday, we told how patients at Northwick Park (pictured) and Ealing have faced the longest A&E waits in England this autumn, following the double closure ten weeks ago . And in September chief executive David McVittie said he did not expect the closures to have a ‘large impact’ on Northwick Park. But now Dr Spencer has said an official investigation will look at the issue. He said local doctors were ‘not happy’ with the recent performance of the A&Es, adding: ‘A lot of this is unexplained. We need to look at that.’ He continued to believe that the increase in patients waiting more than four hours was not due to the closures, but admitted they could have played a part. He said: ‘If we are wrong, we will find out how we got it wrong and not do it again.’ Waiting so long for treatment was ‘not good care’, he said. ‘If your relative was stuck on a trolley for four hours you would be cheesed off.’ The investigation will look at death rates at the hospitals, although he thought it would be ‘hard to say’ if the closures had affected mortality rates. Chris Mote, a Harrow councillor, believed the care of elderly patients had been affected. He said: ‘A month ago I had to go to Northwick Park A&E one evening. I was there for six hours. I met a friend who’d brought his mother in, in her 90s. I went in for a scan at 10am the next day and she was still in casualty – 12 hours later. It was frightening.’ The graphic shows the official NHS A&E figures for Northwick Park and Ealing before and after closure of Central Middlesex and Hammersmith, with more patients waiting longer . Gareth Thomas, Labour MP for Harrow West, said: ‘Well done to The Mail on Sunday. I am glad to see some action being taken. The investigation needs to be independent and be willing to talk not just to medical experts, but people like councillors and MPs who get feedback from patients who use A&E.’ For two years, this paper has highlighted problems hospitals have faced following nearby A&E closures – including at Wexham Park in Slough; Stoke Mandeville in Aylesbury, and North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton, North London. People have also been waiting longer for ambulances in Newark, Nottinghamshire, which lost its A&E in April 2011. Those in charge of the ‘reconfiguration exercises’, as they call them, argue centralising emergency services in larger hospitals drives up standards. They enable the remaining A&Es to be properly staffed at nights and weekends, they say as Britain has a chronic shortage of A&E doctors. But campaigners claim closures are made to save money, not improve care. Tens of thousands of patients are resorting to A&E for dental treatment because they find dentists too expensive, official figures suggest. Since 2010, the number citing cost as the reason they do not go to an NHS dentist has risen by 50 per cent, to just under a million. At the same time the number receiving treatment at A&Es in England for dental problems has leapt fourfold, to 14,500. The true number going to A&E for dental help is likely to be far higher, because almost half of those who attend casualty receive no actual treatment – only advice. Tens of thousands of patients are resorting to A&E for dental treatment because they find dentists too expensive, official figures suggest (file picture) Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said as many as one in 20 visiting A&Es at the weekends or bank holidays was now seeking dental help. But he cautioned: ‘We don’t have any dental equipment or dental skills, so beyond giving them painkillers or antibiotics, there’s nothing we can do.’ NHS dental charges have increased 12 per cent since 2010 – roughly in line with inflation. The cost of a check-up has risen to £18.50, a filling to £50.50 and work such as a crown to £219. The British Dental Health Foundation suggested a key factor behind the rise in A&E attendances – revealed in figures unearthed by Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham – was the dismantling of NHS Direct, which used to employ dental nurses to give advice. The Department of Health said most people could afford a dentist. A spokesman said dental care was free for all children and a third of adults.","Investigation launched into whether closure of two A&Es triggered long waits at nearby hospitals .

"With blonde hair to her waist, four-year-old Evie-Leigh Austin loved pretending to be Rapunzel. But when she found out that there were little girls with cancer who had no hair at all, she insisted having hers cut off and turned into wigs so they ‘could feel like princesses too’. She has donated 14 inches of her golden locks, which was mixed with other hair to make wigs, and has raised enough money to buy three more for sick children. Before having it cut, Evie-Leigh Austin's blonde hair came down to her waist and she loved to pretend to be Rapunzel . Her mother Sarah-May, 26, told her about how cancer can cause hair loss when Evie-Leigh’s grandfather Baron, 67, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. She explained: ‘I said there were boys and girls who don’t have any hair because they are poorly. She loves her hair and was quite upset when she realised there were little girls who don’t have any hair at all. ‘She was adamant she was having it cut. She said she wanted to make the poorly girls smile and feel like a princess like she does. The four-year-old shows off her new shorter bob, after having 14 inches of hair cut off to make wigs for children battling cancer . ‘I didn’t want her to have it cut because I love her hair, but her dad and I agreed that if she wanted to do it for charity she should. When it came to the haircut, she wasn’t bothered, but I was nearly crying. But now I think it suits her. She looks a lot more grown up. ‘She’s done a lovely thing and we are very proud.

Evie-Leigh, from Burnley, also decided to raise £350 – the cost of a wig – for the Little Princess Trust, which provides them to child cancer patients. But she has already tripled her target and has raised more than £1,100. Mrs Austin said having short hair has not stopped Evie-Leigh from feeling like a princess.

"Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum's claims that she proved the existence of Sasquatch with DNA evidence last fall caused even some serious scientists to stand up and take notice. Now, they're rolling over and playing dead. A Houston newspaper reporter had the purposed Big Foot sample DNA tested by an independent geneticist and found Ketchum's 'evidence' isn't what she claims. The sample contains mostly opossum DNA, mixed in with markers from other animals, according to the tests. Houston Chronicle science reporter Eric Berger says there is no evidence that any of the DNA in the sample belongs to a Sasquatch or any other hominid cousins of humans. Coming up empty: The much-vaunted 'proof' that that Bigfoot exists turned out to be false after an independent geneticist found no hominid DNA in a crumb sample . Houston Chronicle science reporter Eric Berger says a reputed sample of Bigfoot sample contains mostly opossum DNA - along with traces from other animals . When Ketchum released her 'scientific study' of Big Foot earlier this year, Berger hammered her for not submitting the paper to a credible peer-reviewed journal and not allowing mainstream researchers to verify her work. Instead, she launched a journal of her own, the DeNovo Scientific Journal, and published her findings online and charged $30 to read the work. 'If Ketchum really had the goods she would have co-authored the paper with reputable scientists and gotten the work published in a reputable scientific journal,' Berger wrote in February. 'Instead she’s playing to an audience that doesn’t understand how science works, that wants to believe Bigfoot exists and is willing to send her some cash to further their delusions.' However, Ketchum approached Berger and offered him definitive proof of her findings - she would let his friend, a top Houston geneticist, take a sample of her Big Foot DNA and test it himself. Ketchum claims the sample came from a family of ten Sasquatches that lives in northern Michigan. She says the sample was taken from the crumbs left behind after the Bigfoots ate blueberry bagels. Face-off: Science reporter Eric Berger had the reputed Bigfoot DNA tested by a top geneticist. He found Melba Ketchum's claim of finding the Sasquatch false . She claims that her analysis of the Big Foot's DNA shows that they are distant cousins to human beings - the result of a non-human hominid mating with human women about 15,000 years ago. Berger admits he allowed himself to get momentarily excited by the prospect of testing Sasquatch DNA. 'If the evidence backed up Ketchum’s claims, I had a blockbuster story. My geneticist source would have a hand in making the scientific discovery of the decade, or perhaps the century. Ketchum would be vindicated,' he wrote. Instead, he says, rational science came crashing down. The sample contained nothing more than the remnants left behind by common forest animals.","Houston Chronicle reporter Eric Berger had the reputed Sasquatch DNA tested by a top geneticist .

"A 3-year-old boy is dead after his parents mistakenly left him in a hot car in Florida over the weekend. dding to the tragedy, the parents were attending a funeral for another family member when the little boy was accidentally left in the car. According to the Manatee County Sheriff's Office, Kyrese Anderson was pronounced dead after spending about three hours in the back of a hot car as his parents attended the funeral - and his two siblings were just feet away in the care of a babysitter. Tragedy: This is the Florida home where Kyrese Anderson, 3, died after his parents accidentally left him in a hot car for four hours while they went to the funeral of another family member . The confusion, the sheriff's office says, started when the baby's parents, Robert Anderson, 29, and Amanda Jo Anderson, 30, took two cars to drop their children off with a babysitter about 1 p.m. The two older children - ages 4 and 5 - were in one of the vehicles, as Kyrese was in the other. The Andersons dropped the two older kids off with the babysitter but forgot about Kyrese. They then took one car to the funeral and left the other - the one containing the boy - in front of the babysitter's house, as the hot, mid-day sun beat down upon it. Heat related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tend to happen in places with warmer climates like the southwest and Florida . 'They get back from the funeral several hours later,' Dave Bristow with . the Manatee County Sheriff's Office told WTSP.com, 'and they ask where the . 3-year-old was, and the babysitter said, ""I thought he was with you?'"" The couple rushed to the car and found the baby unresponsive inside at about 4 p.m. and called 9-1-1. Kyrese was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Heat related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tends to happen, as one would imagine, more frequently in places with warmer climates, like the southwest and Florida. According to the website KidsandCars.org, 33 children were killed in the U.S. when they were left in hot cars in 2011. That's down from 49 in 2010. The table shows non-traffic fatalities amongst children and shows that there were 613 heat-related deaths between 1991 and 2011 . The group suggests parents take precautions to keep them from forgetting about children sitting in rear car seats. For example, leaving a purse or cell phone in the backseat is a good way to ensure that you will look in the back of the vehicle before getting out of it. The group also suggests putting a large stuffed animal in the seat when the baby is not in the vehicle. When the baby is in the vehicle, the group suggests you put the stuffed animal in the front seat as a reminder that a baby is in the back. Additionally, the group suggests parents get in the habit of always opening a rear door when they reach a destination - the group calls this ' look before you lock.' Investigators are awaiting autopsy results to determine Kyrese's cause of death. No charges have been filed against the parents.","The baby was left in the car for about three hours .

"Darren Feldman is set to receive a substantial five-figure sum after a tribunal agreed his position at HCA International had become intolerable . A worker claims that his boss said he wanted to lock up 'Yids' like Apprentice star Lord Sugar's son and gas them and wore obscene t-shirts mocking Jewish football fans. Darren Feldman, 33, said that manager Chris Oates also mocked him by inviting him to JuJu, a champagne bar on London's King's Road. Mr Oates allegedly talked about taunting Jewish Tottenham fans by running past the club's White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with 'IVOR 4 SKIN' printed on the back. Giving evidence, Mr Feldman, who is Jewish, said that on his boss's birthday the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of Apprentice star and former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar. Mr Oates is alleged to have said: 'I'm just messing them around. Quite frankly they're all a bunch of Yids. I'd like to lock them in the building and gas them all'. Qualified surveyor Mr Feldman was a £47,500-a-year construction project manager for private hospital group HCA International. He is suing the firm at Central London employment tribunal for race and religious discrimination, harassment and constructive dismissal. Mr Feldman's solicitor Shilpen Savani said: 'The allegations made by Mr Feldman are very serious. 'This case has been brought because Mr Feldman ultimately felt that he had no option but to leave his employment.' American firm HCA is the world's largest private hospital group. Its London hospitals include the Portland, Princess Grace, Wellington, Lister, London Bridge and University College Hospital’s private ‘Harley Street’ wing . Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, said that within a month of joining the firm in April last year he mentioned to colleagues that he is Jewish. He alleged that director of estates and projects Mr Oates, who is not Jewish, called him into his office. Mr Feldman told the tribunal: 'Chris asked me what I thought of the idea of his to run down White Hart Lane wearing an Arsenal football top with the writing 'IVOR 4 SKIN' on the back. He wrote it out on a piece of scrap paper. 'This was a derogatory and offensive reference to the fact that Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is known to have a large contingent of Jewish supporters. 'I did not know how to answer that question as I was shocked and offended.' Mr Feldman alleged that on his boss's birthday the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of Apprentice star Lord Sugar, when Mr Oates made the remarks . Mr Feldman said that his tormentor then looked up bar JuJu on an iPad and showed him the search results. He recalled: 'Chris then asked if I wanted to go to a club after work which is located along Kings Road called JuJu. 'He pointed his finger at me saying 'want to go JuJu, Juju?' repeating it several times in an intimidating manner.' He added: 'Chris was not only a bully in the way that he treated me but he was also seriously abusive towards me because I was Jewish.' Mr Feldman said that Mr Oates moved him without warning from HCA's office in central London to the Portland Hospital and began calling him by his surname. Mr Feldman told a tribunal that he felt that his position had been made intolerable . He said: 'It was increasingly obvious to me that he disliked my presence in the office. 'I am convinced all of this negativity towards me was influenced by his dislike for me due to the fact that I was a Jew. I found it humiliating and upsetting.' In September last year, Mr Feldman was at a restaurant with Mr Oates when a black diner entered. This allegedly prompted Mr Oates to make the racist remark 'Feldman, do you want your boots polished?' In October last year, HCA's construction team were celebrating Mr Oates' birthday in a Marylebone bar. Mr Feldman said: 'I spoke to him about possibly renting Fitzroy House, located along Euston Road, and liaising with Daniel Sugar, the son of Lord Alan Sugar the owner. 'He replied with words to the effect: 'I'm just messing them around. Quite frankly they're all a bunch of Yids. I'd like to lock them in the building and gas them all'. 'I was in disbelief. I was even more disturbed because Chris knew I was Jewish and would find the remark particularly offensive due to the Holocaust. 'He either did not care about this or, even more worryingly, said it deliberately to hurt and offend me. 'I finished my drink and left soon afterwards.' Lord Sugar, 66, was born into a Jewish family in Hackney, east London. His property company Amsprop - managed by his 41-year-old son Daniel - holds most of his £800 million wealth and owns a string of London offices. Four days later, the manager allegedly told Mr Feldman he did not see him 'fitting into the business in the future'. In response, Mr Feldman quit his job. He told the tribunal: 'I felt that my position had been made intolerable and I did not wish to expose myself to any more abuse from Chris. 'It had become a very nasty and unpleasant place to work and I did not feel I could take any more. 'The decision to resign my employment with HCA was a very difficult one for me as I was giving up a very good salary and a really good job. 'However, I felt this was the only option available to me as I could not tolerate any more racist or religious abuse or bullying from Chris. 'I am also very saddened and disappointed that HCA has tolerated such racist and bullying behaviour by a senior manager and has supported him throughout this case. 'I believe this is really very shameful and is not how any responsible employer should behave in this day and age.' HCA and Mr Oates strenuously deny all Mr Feldman's allegations. A HCA spokesperson said: 'It would be inappropriate for us to make comment on the case whilst it is sub judice other than to state that we refute his allegations. 'We have a clear code of conduct around acceptable, professional and ethical behaviour and take any claim of discrimination very seriously.' The case continues.

"While reporting on a top high school football recruiting event in Oregon, a FOX Sports newscaster got a little bit too close to the action. Amy Campbell, a reporter for FOX Sports Next, was in the midst of interviewing recruiting analyist Chad Simmons when rising star footballer Ermon Lane came crashing into her on the sidelines. Though Campbell later told the sports broadcasting network that she was unharmed, the entire incident was caught on video and as with many sports and news bloopers, has become an Internet sensation. FOX Sports newscaster Amy Campbell (center) was knocked over by high school football star Ermon Lane (right) while interviewing recruiting analyst Chad Simmons (left) at an elite summer football camp . In the video, picked up by local television station ABC WPBF, Campbell is listening intently to Simmons speak when Ermon comes running up behind her at full speed to catch a pass. Screams are heard as Campbell, Simmons, and Lane all take a tumble and drop off camera. Though Simmons, who saw Lane coming at . the last minute, tried to block Campbell, he was unable to stop the . four-star wide receiver prospect. At 6''2 Lane is a powerhouse, and though currently a rising senior at Homestead High School in Florida, weights 193 lbs. He is a highly sought after prospect for Universities such as Miami, Florida State or Florida, according to FOX Sports. The collision happened at The Opening, a summer recruiting camp for the nation's top high school football players, which was held the the Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, according to the television report. In the aftermath of the crash, which went viral on YouTube, Campbell told FOX Sports she was not injured. Unsuspecting: Moments before the collision Campbell smiles as she interviews Simmons about the summer's recruiting prospects . Ball in play: While Campbell's attention is focused on her interview, behind her Lane (in white on the right hand side of the picture) begins to run in her direction to catch the football in midair .

Meanwhile Simmons (left) sees the accident about to happen and reaches out to help Campbell . 'My knee got a little bit bruised,' she said to the sport network. 'It's sore today, but nothing serious. It could've been a lot worse. At least I can take a hit, right?' Campbell told her network that the crash may have been captured on film, but was not the first incident that day. '[Lane] has almost collided with me several times since I've been out here,' said, explaining that earlier in the day the high school football star narrowly missed her when he came out of the end zone. Too Late: Campbell (center), feeling Lane (right) behind her senses something is wrong and braces for impact .

"A woman has spoken of her terror at discovering that she harboured flesh-eating maggots inside her ear. When Rochelle Harris, 27, from Derby, returned from the holiday of a lifetime in Peru, she thought little of the headaches that she had started to develop on the flight back to the UK. But within hours she had developed excruciating shooting pains down one side of her face and had started to hear strange scratching sounds in her head. The next morning she woke to a pillow soaked with fluid from her ear. Scroll down for video . Rochelle Harris has been on holiday in Peru with her boyfriend James (pictured) when she walked through a swarm of flies. On the flight back to the UK she developed head pains and started to hear unusual sounds inside her head . Rochelle's ordeal features in a new Discovery Channel documentary, called 'Bugs, Bites and Parasites' that follows the work of specialists who are faced with patients exhibiting a variety of mysterious symptoms - more often than not from people who have travelled abroad. On her arrival back in the UK, Rochelle became increasingly concerned there may be something seriously wrong, so she visited her local Accident and Emergency department at the Royal Derby Hospital. The New World Army Screw Worm Fly (CGI pictured) laid eggs inside Rochelle's ear where they hatched and feasted on her flesh. They eventually burrowed 12mm into Rochelle's ear but luckily did not hit her facial nerve, which could have left her face paralysed . As doctors tried to get the maggots out of Rochelle's ear, they retreated further into her head. Doctors described discovering a 'writhing mass' of the creatures deep inside her ear . Initially doctors weren't concerned by her symptoms and presumed that they had developed because of a minor ear infection or an infected mosquito bite. She was referred to the ear nose and throat (ENT) team for further investigation to rule out a more sinister problem, however. Rochelle said that as her ear was being examined, the ENT specialist went silent. The doctor had found a small hole in the ear canal which needed further investigation but would not explain what the problem was. After almost an hour of silent examination Rochelle, and her mother who had accompanied her, asked if they were any closer to a diagnosis. The scan revealed that the maggots have burrowed 12mm into Rochelle's head . Also known as Cochliomyia, the fly belongs to the blowfly family. They thrive in hot, tropical countries. The larvae feed on living tissue and can cause deep, pocket-like lesions in the skin. This feeding can cause significant damage to the host animal - or human, as in Rochelle's case. She said: 'My Mum asked her ""Can you see what it is?"" and the doctor said ""If you don't mind I'd prefer to speak to the registrar before I tell you anything"". 'My Mum said ""Please tell us"" and that's when the doctor said ""You've got maggots in your ear"". I burst into tears instantly.' Doctors tried to get the maggots out but the more medics delved into her ear, the more the larvae retreated into Rochelle's head. 'I was very scared - I wondered if they were in my brain. I thought to myself ""This could be very, very serious.""' Doctors ordered an emergency brain scan to find out if any damage had been done by the maggots,  as well as to determine how many there were and where they were hiding. Here the the moment doctors found a 'writhing mass of maggots' is captured. The tips of a maggot's head can be seen as doctors try to extract the larvae from Rochelle's ear . There was a risk that they were migrating through her head. If one reached her brain it could cause meningitis, fatal bleeding and if one ate through her facial nerve she might be left facially paralysed. Luckily, the scan showed that no damage had been . done to Rochelle's ear drum, blood vessels or facial nerve. But they did discover that the . maggots had chewed a 12mm hole into a ear canal. Doctors then tried to drown them by flooding the ear canal with olive oil. 'I had to wait overnight to see if the treatment worked,' said Rochelle. 'It was longest few hours of my life. 'I just wanted them out of me and now I knew what was causing the sensations and sounds it made it all the worse.' Rochelle Harris was given a MRI scan to see if the maggots had migrated to her brain, but luckily they had not got very far. She said the wait for minor surgery to remove the maggots was the longest few hours of her life . The next day doctors checked her ear and . astonishingly the maggots were still alive. They managed to remove two, . but doctors were concerned there might be one more left inside her. Rochelle was sedated and surgeons explored her ear using a microscope and speculum. They were shocked by what they found. As they pushed further inside the ear, they found what they described as a 'writhing mass of maggots'. The two of maggots that had been . extracted were not alone - further examination revealed Rochelle was in fact hosting a family of eight large maggots. Rochelle (pictured with boyfriend James) said she remembered walking through a swarm of flies when in Peru and a fly did indeed get inside her ear. But once she shooed it away she thought nothing more of it . The maggots were immediately sent to a lab for analysis where it was discovered that that a New World Army Screw Worm Fly had laid eggs inside her ear. Rochelle said she remembered walking through a swarm of flies when in Peru and a fly had got inside her ear. But once she had shooed it away she thought nothing more of it. Since her traumatic encounter, Rochelle has suffered no long-term problems and she says that there has been a positive side-effect of having maggots living in her head. She said: 'I'm no longer as squeamish as I was about bugs - how can you be when they've been inside your head?'","Rochelle Harris, 27, went on holiday to Peru with her boyfriend this year .
