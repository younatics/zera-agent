The Queen should open up Buckingham Palace for longer and rent it out for commercial events, MPs will say today. Commons watchdogs insist the royals need more money-spinning ventures to stop their palaces crumbling after years of complacency. The backlog of repairs is so great it will cost at least £50million to restore the Queen’s London residence and other historic buildings. Forty per cent of royal properties – including parts of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle – are below ‘acceptable’ standards, with some in a dangerous condition. Members of the Commons public accounts . committee want royal courtiers to get a ‘firmer grip’ on their finances . to stop taxpayers footing the whole bill. ‘The . truth of the matter is that the palace has been living from hand to . mouth for some time,’ the committee’s chairman, Margaret Hodge, told the . Mail last night. ‘The trouble is that people are frightened, because . this is the Royal Family, to address the issue head on.’ She suggested extending the opening season at Buckingham Palace and exploring other business opportunities. ‘The Queen is not there for much of . the time and I find it hard to believe they can’t open the palace to the . public for longer,’ she added. The . committee’s findings follow a parliamentary grilling of the sovereign’s . most senior staff last autumn over whether the monarchy offered value . for money to taxpayers. Senior royal aides maintain the . repairs backlog has built up because of a real-terms squeeze of up to 60 . per cent in their funding by governments over the past 20 years. This, they say, has forced them to patch up the palaces instead of embark on whole-scale repairs. But . the MPs claimed yesterday that the Queen ‘has not been served well by . the Royal Household and by the Treasury ... in balancing the books and . preserving heritage buildings’. According to MPs the Royal Household has . fallen short by spending more than it took in. Net expenditure of . £33.3million in 2012-2013 was 7 per cent higher than its income of . £31million.That resulted in the . palace taking out £2.3million from its reserves – leaving the Queen with . just £1million in the bank. That was described by MPs as an . ‘historically low level of contingency’. Repair work: Commons watchdogs insist the royals need more money-spinning ventures to stop their palaces crumbling after years of complacency . In need of repair: The backlog of repairs is so great it will cost at least £50million to restore the Queen¿s London residence (pictured in 2007) and other historic buildings . The report warned: ‘The Household . needs to get better at planning and managing its budgets for the longer . term – and the Treasury should be more actively involved in reviewing . what the Household is doing.’ It . was even more critical of what it described as the Royal Household’s . failure to look after ‘nationally important heritage properties . adequately’. The Royal . Estate encompasses about 360 buildings including Windsor Castle, . Clarence House, St James Palace and parts of Kensington Palace. The accounts committee is now demanding . that staff ‘get a much firmer grip’ on how they plan to address the . repairs backlog. MPs also urged the Queen and her staff to drum up ways . of generating more income and achieving savings. Buckingham Palace has been open to the paying public for around two months each summer since 1993 and small number of state apartments, particularly in St James’s and Kensington palaces, are occasionally rented out for carefully-selected commercial ventures. It emerged that US investment bank JP Morgan hired Buckingham Palace out for a private dinner attended by the Duke of York, Tony Blair and former UN chief Kofi Annan. Last year these ventures raised £11.6million. But MPs also highlighted the fact that . staffing levels have remained at around 430 for the past seven years, . with no apparent cuts.

Sun is forecasted for the Super Bowl kickoff this Sunday - but it will still be the coldest on record. The Weather Channel predicts a high of 37F (3C) and a low of 24 F (-4C) on Sunday with sun, a low chance of showers and slow winds in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home to the MetLife Stadium. While this is far kinder than commentators, fans and meteorologists have predicted in the weeks leading up to Sunday's game, it will still take the crown for the coldest ever Super Bowl. The current record is 39 degrees, which was set in 1972 in New Orleans. Promising: The weather forecast for the Super Bowl, which is being held in New Jersey, shows that it'll be sunny in the afternoon - easing fears that it'll be too treacherous for fans and players . Chill: But even though there are low chances of rain, it is still expected to be the coldest Super Bowl on record as the rest of the country also battles freezing temperatures . This weekend's chilly temperatures mean that spectators will have to take precautions before watching the Seahawks battle the Broncos.

AccuWeather also warned against . troublesome travel conditions, saying it expects 'a typical winter day' and potentially 'slushy roads'. The . promising forecast comes after weeks of speculation about whether the . game would go ahead, after the area was blanketed with snow in recent . cold snaps. The NFL had even considered moving the time of the game if officials concluded that the fans' safety was in danger. It meant that the choice of New Jersey sparked upset from commentators, including form Chicago Bears coach, Mike Ditka. 'The weather's going to be a problem,' Ditka told the Detroit Free Press. 'They made a big mistake. The game shouldn’t be there. I mean, it’s stupid.' He added that the choice of stadium isn't fair on the players, who want to show off their skills.

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . PUBLISHED: . 15:29 EST, 28 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:23 EST, 28 January 2014 . The University of North Carolina has apologized for a slew of fake classes that allowed student-athletes to easily get passing grades and keep their focus on the lucrative business of college sports. From the 1990s, well-known 'easy' courses were on offer at the Chapel Hill school's African and Afro-American Studies Department. The classes were attended in high numbers by football players, basketball stars and wrestlers among others, allowing them to coast through academic life and focus on athletics. An investigation in 2012 found that some courses allowed students to get a passing grade just for submitting term papers without attending classes or sitting exams. UNC officials have admitted that there was a lack of academic rigor in some courses offered through their African-American studies department, disproportionately attended by college athletes . Some 216 classes at UNC were found to have problems over a 15-year period - and up to 500 students had their grades changed without authorization. Blame was placed with the former Afro-American Studies Department chairman . Julius Nyang'oro and former administrator Deborah Crowder. Nyangâ€™oro was criminally indicted in December 2013 for defrauding UNC. It is unclear whether the Athletic Department at Chapel Hill pushed for the fraudulent courses or allowed talented athletes to exploit them. The school was slow to admit that anything untoward had taken place and . earlier this month halted a research project into the literacy levels of . UNC athletes - which found that several were reading . at below third-grade level. Academic officials are now taking responsibility for a lack of rigor in some students' educations. James Dean, the executive vice chancellor at UNC, told Bloomberg: 'We made mistakes. Horrible things happened that Iâ€™m ashamed of. James Dean, the executive vice chancellor at UNC, said that the university's integrity was damaged by fraudulent classes while Chancellor Carol L. Folt (right) admitted that students deserved better from UNC . 'Student-athletes and other students, too, were hurt. The integrity of our university was badly damaged.' Chancellor . Carol L. Folt also addressed the matter in a statement on the . university's website. She said that reforms were underway to fix . past problems but added: 'Offering courses that were unsupervised was . not reflective of the standards that we expect for our University. All . of those students who were involved in those courses deserved better . from us.' The pressures on . student-athletes to perform outside of the classroom is high as the . National Collegiate Athletic Association is a multi billion dollar . business with millions of fans across the U.S. College athletes often go on to become the next stars of the NFL, NBA and at the Olympics. The problem is not specific to UNC - schools across the country place great importance on lucrative championship wins, so easing off academically on students who are highly talented on the court or field is a common problem. UNC is taking changes to the academic program seriously. The disgraced department of the past has been renamed the African, African-American, and Diaspora Studies department. Mr Dean told Bloomberg he would be examining other departments to see if athletes were 'clustering' in classes that had become known for easy grades. Other reforms are now in place including tighter supervision over the academic program of school athletes and an internal investigation has been launched into the scandal to find out how the problem took root. UNC Chapel Hill, with its prominent football ground, has admitted that college players were let down when it came to academics .","Investigation in 2012 found some courses allowed students to pass just for .

In a harsh regime where the youngsters were known by numbers rather than their names, many were subjected to humiliation, threats and physical abuse, counsel to the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, Christine Smith QC said. Investigation: Christine Smith QC said youngsters were known by numbers, and many were subjected to humiliation, threats and physical abuse. She said children with assaulted with sticks, straps and kettle flexes . Forty-nine former residents of the Nazareth House Children's Home and St Joseph's Home, Termonbacca in Derry, have given evidence, describing their treatment at the hands of the nuns to the inquiry sitting at Banbridge courthouse. A total of 16 church and state-run care homes are being investigated as part of the inquiry presided over by retired judge Sir Anthony Hart, and is expected to run until June next year. Outlining the details of the alleged abuse, Ms Smith told the inquiry children were assaulted with sticks, straps and kettle flexes. It is said siblings were separated and not told where their brothers or sisters were living, children were bullied by their peers, locked in cupboards and humiliated for bed wetting, and forced to stand with the soiled sheets on their heads as punishment. Youngsters were allegedly forced to work on farms or in the laundry instead of going to school and Christmas presents and other personal items were confiscated. Ms Smith said those giving testimony accused the nuns of leaving them without food and added that when they were ill they were allegedly forced to eat their own vomit. She said the accusations also included allegations of sexual abuse by older children, visiting priests, employees and in one instance a nun. Allegations: The inquiry is the largest of its kind into the institutional child abuse, and will look at allegations of abuse at 16 church and state-run homes, including Nazareth House children's home in Londonderry, pictured . Witnesses: Forty-nine former residents of the . Nazareth House Children's Home and St Joseph's Home, Termonbacca (pictured) in . Derry, have given evidence, describing their treatment at the hands of . the nuns . A senior member of the order made a submission to the inquiry acknowledging that an individual sister or common staff member, having worked long hours with children from troubled backgrounds, may have lost her temper and acted inappropriately. She accepted there was scope for bullying because they could not keep eyes on all the children. 'The sisters always tried to provide the best care with the staff and resources available to them,' she added. She said they had little information to give the inquiry about sexual assaults but were extremely upset about them. At Nazareth House in 1996, a sexual abuse allegation was raised with police. 'Police advised the home in 1997 that a prosecution would not be made,' Ms Smith said. In August 1997, a further allegation of abuse against the same person was made by two people. The individual was subsequently dismissed. Ms Smith said delays by the order in submitting evidence caused considerable difficulties. Material was not properly ordered and was still being received up to last week, despite hearings being planned for many months. She said: 'This less than whole-hearted and rapid response on the part of the congregation has caused considerable difficulties to the work of the inquiry. 'The congregation is not the only body whose approach has produced problems. We do appreciate that this is not always avoidable, but we hoped that such late delivery could have been avoided - given the difficulties which it causes for the inquiry.' She added: 'Until recently the cooperation by the congregation of the sisters of Nazareth in the provision of material has not been as complete or rapid as the inquiry would have hoped.' The order was asked to cooperate voluntarily and produce documents in 2012. Ms Smith acknowledged that the information was old and not stored in a single orderly archive. 'A considerable amount of material was provided. However, the information which the inquiry received has been provided in a haphazard and piecemeal fashion.' The inquiry team spent a considerable amount of time trying to work out which nuns were which and when they were involved in the homes. A significant volume of information has been provided in recent days. On Friday they received two further witness statements. Public hearings are due to finish in June 2015, with the inquiry team to report to Stormont's power-sharing Executive by the start of 2016.","Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry will examine allegations of abuse at 16 church and state-run care homes across Northern Ireland .

Abuse: Former Delaware pediatrician Melvin Morse plans to testify in his trial which started yesterday. Morse is being accused of waterboarding his 11-year-old stepdaughter . The former pediatrician accused of waterboarding his 11-year-old stepdaughter will 'absolutely' testify in his trial, the man's attorney told Delaware's News Journal Monday. Opening statements in the trial against 60-year-old Melvin Morse were scheduled for Tuesday morning after a jury of eight women and four men was selected yesterday. Morse is pleading not guilty to child endangerment and assault charges following his 2012 arrest for dragging his stepdaughter across the driveway by her ankles. After being interviewed by authorities, the girl revealed that she had been waterboarded by her stepfather on four occasions and that her mother did nothing to stop the punishment. The girl's mother, Pauline Morse, was also arrested at the time but plead guilty last May to misdemeanor charges and agreed to testify against her ex-husband. The two divorced several years prior to the abuse, but continued to live as husband and wife. Morse was the eminent researcher on near-death experiences in children and had appeared on Oprah, Good Morning America and Larry King Live to discuss his research. He is the author of two books on near-death experiences, 'Closer to the Light' and 'Transformed by the Light'. Expert: Before his arrest, Morse, right, was the eminent researcher on near-death experiences in children. He was interviewed as an expert by Larry King and Oprah and authored two books on the subject . High profile: In 1992, he was also interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, pictured holding up a copy of his book . But his medical license was revoked after his neighbor reported him for child abuse two years ago. He worked as a pediatrician in a private practice in Milton, Delaware. His stepdaughter, then 11, told the . neighbor she refused to get out of the car when they returned home, so . Morse forcibly brought her into the house by dragging her by her ankles . across the gravel driveway and then spanked her. In an interview following the initial driveway incident, the girl told authorities about how her stepfather would waterboard her as punishment for bad behavior. He would hold her under faucets in the . kitchen, bathroom and bathtub so that water would shoot up her nose, . mimicking the sensation of drowning - a technique best-known for its use . on suspected terrorists following the 9/11 attacks. She said her mother Pauline did nothing to stop the torture. A changed woman: The girl's mother Pauline Morse was also arrested (mugshot left) for letting the abuse happen but plead guilty last May and agreed to testify in her ex-husband's trial. As of last May, she was still working to regain custody of her two daughters . Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over someone's face, simulating the sensation of drowning. A cloth is often placed over the captive's face so their breathing is restricted for up to 40 seconds as water is continually poured onto them.It dates back to the Spanish Inquisition, when it was a preferred interrogation technique as it leaves no marks on the person's body.The practice can cause extreme pain and distress, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, long-lasting psychological damage and death. It can also cause broken bones as the captive attempts to escape.In 2007, it emerged that the CIA had waterboarded three Al-Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003. The Bush administration allowed it as a form of interrogation by narrowing the definition of torture.In 2009, President Obama banned its use, but the Department of Defense has refused to say whether it uses the technique as a form of training on its troops. On one occasion Morse even threatened . he 'was going to wrap her in a blanket and do it so that she could not . move'. Another time he allegedly told her she 'could go five minutes . without brain damage'. The girl added that Morse would . 'sometimes look away while he did it and would become afraid that he . would lose track of time and she would die'. After . the alleged torture, she would 'go outside and cry', but Morse would . come outside and hold her nose and mouth with his hand, according to . court documents. 'He would . tell her she was lucky he did not use duct tape,' police noted. 'He . would not let go until she lost feeling and collapsed to the ground.' The girl added that she never knew what she had done to be punished and felt frightened. Her . then 5-year-old sister was also interviewed and said that, although . she witnessed the abuse to her sister, she was never targeted 'because . she is too young for it'. At the time of the arrest, police investigated the possibility that Morse was using his stepdaughter for his research. Both Melvin and Pauline Morse were released on $14,500 bail after their August 2012 arrest, but barred from seeing the children. Pauline Morse had been allowed visitation . when she struck a plea deal last May in which she agreed to testify . against her husband in his trial. At the time she was working to regain . custody of her two daughters and her public defender Dean Johnson said . she had 'totally changed' following her arrest. 'She has independence of thought...whereas before Melvin made the decisions and she went along,' Mr Johnson said in May. According . to her Facebook, Pauline Morse had worked as a researcher and the . treasurer of her ex-husband's non-profit, The Institute for the . Scientific Study of Consciousness, but is now a personal assistant at a . salon. Taking work home: At the time of his arrest, police investigated the idea that Morse performed the waterboarding as part of his research .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 06:11 EST, 28 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:35 EST, 28 January 2014 . The husband of a brain-dead woman who was kept alive during her pregnancy has revealed how he named the fetus before she was taken off life support. Paramedic Erick Munoz's wife Marlise was declared brain-dead after he found her unconscious at their family home on November 26, possibly due to a blood clot. But because she was 14 weeks pregnant, doctors refused to take her off life support under Texas law. After winning a lengthy legal battle, Mrs Munoz's life support was switched off on Sunday and both she and the 23-week-old fetus, which was said to have abnormalities because of oxygen deprivation, died at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. Speaking for the first time since his wife's death, Mr Munoz has now revealed how he named what would have been the couple's second child - calling the fetus by his wife's middle name, Nicole. Erick Munoz, pictured after winning his court battle in Texas on Friday, has revealed he named the unborn fetus after his wife's second name Maria . Mother: Marlise Munoz was already a mother of one. She was a few months pregnant when she suffered a blood clot and went brain dead . He said doctors at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth indicated to him that the fetus would likely have been a girl, although his attorneys previously claimed the fetus suffered from a lower body deformation that made it impossible to determine its sex. 'They think it was a female,' Mr Munoz said in a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press. Mr Munoz also told WFAA-TV in an interview which aired on Monday evening that he has seen many negative comments about his decision, but he feels he made the right choice. 'I'm just glad they are not in my shoes. I hope every day that no one ever has to go through what I went through,' he said. Mr Munoz said his wife will be cremated and there are no plans for memorial or funeral services because the family is concerned that protesters would show up. 'She made me a better man, and I thank her for it. I thank her very much,' he said. Both the hospital and his attorneys agreed the fetus could not have been born alive that early in the pregnancy, and the fetus was not delivered when John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth complied on Sunday with a judge's order to pull any life-sustaining treatment from Marlise Munoz. What she would have wanted: Husband Erik Munoz says his wife wouldn't have wanted to keep living in her condition . Tense weeks: Erick Munoz stands with a photograph of himself, left, with wife Marlise and their son Mateo, in Haltom City, Texas. Marlise was removed from life support on Sunday after the family's high profile fight to let the pregnant woman die . Doctors said Mrs Munoz, then 16-weeks pregnant, was brain-dead in November after Erick Munoz found her unconscious in their Haltom City home, possibly due to a blood clot. But the hospital had kept on machines to keep her organs functioning for the sake of the fetus, which it said was per Texas law. The case inspired debates about abortion and end-of-life decisions, as well as whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. Mr Munoz's attorneys, Heather King and Jessica Hall Janicek, had issued a statement last week saying that according to medical records, 'the fetus is distinctly abnormal'. The attorneys said the fetus also had fluid building up inside the skull and possibly had a heart problem. Mr Munoz told AP earlier that he believed in God but felt his training as a paramedic suggested the fetus would have been seriously harmed by his wife's condition. Unborn: The couple is pictured here with their first son Matteo . Filing suit: Erick Munoz filed suit against John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive . He sued the hospital because it would not remove life support. He said his wife, also a paramedic, had told him she would not want to be kept alive under such circumstances. In refusing his request, the hospital cited Texas law that says life-sustaining treatment cannot be withdrawn from a pregnant patient, regardless of her end-of-life wishes. Legal experts told AP that the hospital was misreading the Texas Advance Directives Act and that the law isn't an absolute command to keep a pregnant woman on life support. Judge R.H Wallace Jr sided with Erick Munoz on Friday, saying in his order: 'Mrs Munoz is dead.' The case has been noted by Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry and the two leading candidates running to replace him, but none has called for any new laws or action yet. In recent years, the Legislature has enacted several new anti-abortion restrictions, including setting the legal guideline for when a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. During a debate among the four big-name Republicans running for lieutenant governor on Monday night, all of them said the judge erred in ordering that Marlise Munoz be removed from life support and vowed if elected to tighten state law so that a similar outcome couldn't happen again.

Donald Preston Jr appeared unaware that he had crashed his SUV into Atlantic City's Irish Pub Sunday afternoon as police arrested him for drunk driving . Atlantic City's famed Irish Pub has closed for the first time since Hurricane Sandy when a man crashed his car into the bar after being refused a drink. Donald Preston Jr, 50, of Pleasantville, New Jersey was charged with drunk driving after ramming into the historic 111-year-old bar Sunday afternoon. Bartender Jack Dziegrenuk told the Press of Atlantic City that Preston appeared intoxicated when he came into the 24-hour bar around 2:30pm, so he refused to serve him. After that, Preston took off his jacket and placed it on a stool to go to the bathroom. When he came out, he grabbed his jacket and the bartender thought 'This will be easy on me' as Preston smiled, waved and walked out the door. But just a few minutes later the bar was shaken by a blast as Preston drove his SUV straight into the building near the front door. 'It sounded like a bomb pretty much went off,' manager Tracey Talley told NBC 40. Talley said the drunk driver struck the bar right where a couple was sitting, but they had gotten up just seconds before. Only one patron was injured in the crash, but refused medical attention on the scene. The bar is now closed for the first time since 2012's Hurricane Sandy since Preston left a gaping hole in the front of the building. The bar's century-old cherrywood bar was pushed in slightly at the base and its metal guad rail dented. The crash also broke a water pipe. Crash: Firefighters examine the damage to the Irish Pub on Sunday . The damage: No one was injured in the crash but the bar sustained major damage. Preston's car left a gaping hole in the front of the building and also pushed in the century-old cherrywood bar . Fellow manager Frank Pileggi told MailOnline that full restoration will take a month or more but they are working to cover the hole in the front temporarily to reopen for business on Thursday or Friday, in time for Super Bowl Sunday. Surveillance footage viewed by the Press of Atlantic City shows Preston leaving the bar and driving his SUV around in circles before taking a turn and barreling into the bar. Mr Pileggi says they have turned the surveillance footage over the police, and are not allowed to release it. The pub's managers don't believe Preston did it on purpose, since he asked police 'Did I do that?' while being arrested. An accident: Pub manager Tracey Talley says she doesn't believes Preston drove into the bar out of vengeance, just that he lost control . 'I don't think he was driving into the building. I just think he lost control of the car,' Ms Talley said. Mr Pileggi says Preston didn't seem vengeful and there wasn't a confrontation with the bartender. The six-story brick building housing the Irish Pub has been a boardwalk fixture since 1900 and has only been owned by three families in its entire history. It was initially opened as the Elwood Hotel. During Prohibition, it was turned into a speakeasy dance hall complete with a secret staircase and a trap door under the carpeting. Before: The six-story building housing the Irish Pub has been off the Atlantic City boardwalk since 1900 and has only been owned by three families in its entire history . After: Staff say the damage will take a month or more to fix, but it will be reopen by Thursday or Friday, in time for Super Bowl Sunday . Current owner Cathy Burke bought the pub with her husband Richard in 1971, and says she has experienced an unexpected outpouring of support from all over the world following the crash. 'Different people have called or dropped by,' Mrs Burke told the Press.'They give best wishes and they ask, ""Are you going change things?"" I say, you canâ€™t improve on perfection. I want everything to look exactly the same. To me, I want the Pub to be the Pub.' In addition to the DWI charge, Preston faces charges of careless driving and failure to stop while entering the roadway.","Donald Preston Jr, 50, appeared unaware that he had crashed into the historic bar Sunday afternoon, asking police 'Did I do that?'

Multi-millionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins has appeared on Bloomberg TV to address the outrage over his comments in an op ed to the wall Street Journal comparing the 'progressive war on the one percent' to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The appearance was less an apology and more a re-assertion of his viewpoints, with some bragging about his wealth thrown in. Perkins said he 'regrets' using the word Kristallnacht but said he does not regret the message 'at all.' In danger: The 'creative one per cent' says Perkins, is being threatened . After mentioning that he had spoken to Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League - twice - Perkins said that Kristallnacht was a 'terrible word to have chosen,' but apparently did not regret the broader comparision of the 'demonization' of the one per cent with Nazism. Perkins said he used the word because during Occupy San Francisco, 'they broke the windows at Wells Fargo bank, they marched up to our automobile strip and broke all the windows in the luxury car dealerships.' He noticed police standing by watching, he said, and thought, 'Well, this is how Kristallnacht began.' Interviewer Emily Chang questions Perkins as to the relevance of the analogy, to which Perkins responds: . 'The Jews were only one per cent of the German population. Most Germans had never met a Jew. And yet Hitler was able to demonize the Jews,' he said. 'My point was that when you start to use hatred against a minority, it can get out of control. 'The creative one per cent are threatened.' Useful: Perkins with his 'underwater airplane' He goes on to say that his friend and former business partner Eugene Kleiner, who fled to Austria to escape the Nazis, would have agreed with him - if he was still alive. When asked what should be done to improve the lives of 'the 99 per cent,' Perkins said, 'I think that the solution is less interference, lower taxes, let the rich do what the rich do — which is get richer, and along the way they bring everybody else along with them, when the system is working.' Bafflingly, Perkins took the opportunity to point out that his watch - a Richard Mille - 'could buy a six-pack of Rolexes' and smugly corrected Chang on his 'underwater airplane.' The final nail in his coffin may have been when he spoke of the reason for his inflammatory letter in the first place: someone called his ex-wife romance novelist Danielle Steele a 'snob.' This offensive slight sent the self-described 'classical self-made man' into defense mode. 'So I thought since I'm a knight - I'm a literal knight of the Kingdom of Norway - I would get on my horse and charge forth in her defense,' he told a bemused Chang. 'Six pack of Rolexes': The incredibly expensive Richard Mille watch - yours for the price of a family home - that Perkins wears . Shining armor: Perkins didn't appreciate his former wife Danielle Steele being labeled a snob - so wrote an inflammatory letter comparing the one per cent to persecuted Jews in WWII . Perkins, who repeatedly spoke of his 'message' helpfully boiled it down to the viewer to this: . 'It's absurd to demonize the rich for doing what the rich do, which is get richer by creating opportunity for others. 'I think the solution is less interference, lower taxes, let the rich do what the rich do.' The California one per center was widely ridiculed after the Wall Street Journal published his letter comparing criticism of the super-rich to the Holocaust. He wrote another letter Sunday, this time to Bloomberg, in which he compared the 'Occupy' movement to pre-Nazi rise to power fascism in Germany. 'In the Nazi area it was racial demonization, now it is class demonization,' wrote the Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers venture capital firm co-founder. He also expressed 'shock' over the windows broken at luxury dealerships and banks in San Francisco while the press 'focuses its wrath on the one per cent. The letter was written as a KPCB spokesperson immediately moved to distance itself from Perkins. 'Tom Perkins has not been involved in KPCB for years,' the firm tweeted. 'We were shocked by his views expressed today in the WSJ and do not agree.' Today, Perkins suggested the firm had 'thrown him under a bus,' and hinted that it was suffering in his absence. 'As I’ve distanced myself from the firm, there’s been a corresponding decline in the firm,' he told Chang. Not backing down: Billionaire Tom Perkins clarified his Saturday Nazi reference by comparing the 'Occupy' movement to pre-Nazi rise to power fascism in Germany . The second letter was written after Bloomberg contacted Perkins to clarify what he meant in his original letter to the Wall Street Journal, according to Business Insider. Perkins opened his letter to the Journal: 'Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its ""one per cent,"" namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the ""rich.""' Mr Perkins describing the hatred attracted by Google workers in San Francisco and an incident in which his former wife author Danielle Steele was branded a 'snob' in the San Francisco Chronicle in a row over the height of her hedge. 'This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent ""progressive"" radicalism unthinkable now?' he continued. Kristallnacht translates as 'The night of broken glass' and refers to coordinated attacks on Jews in Germany on November 9 1938, as authorities looke on and did nothing. Superyacht: Mr Perkins commissioned the $150m yacht Maltese Falcon which he later sold . Mr Perkins, 82, was educated at MIT before gaining an MBA from Harvard. He founded Venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1973 and has served as a director on boards of companies including Compaq. He recently spent $150 million building a super yacht called Maltese Falcon and lives on a 60th floor, 5,500ft penthouse overlooking San Francisco Bay. Before that, he was a general manager . credited with building Hewlett Packard into the huge company it is known . as today and started a successful laser company based on his own . invention. Comparisons: Mr Perkins referenced the Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany in 1938 . Protests: Mr Perkins also discusses the protests in San Francisco against Google buses and tech workers driving up the area's cost of living . His comments comparing criticism of the rich to the Nazis persecution of the Jews that resulted in six million deaths raised many an eyebrow. 'The parallel of Nazi Germany and some people getting kind of annoyed by the tech bro dudes is exactly ZERO,' Kaili Joy Gray wrote on the Wonkette blog. Author and New York Times writer Steven Greenhouse tweeted: 'As someone who lost numerous relatives to the Nazi gas chambers, I find statements like this revolting & inexplicable.'","Thomas Perkins, 82, appeared on Bloomberg TV to address his controversial op ed letter to the Wall Street Journal .

Jodi Arias's legal bills have surpassed a staggering $2million - and are expected to only increase. The costs, funded by Arizona taxpayers, are being used to pay for court-appointed attorneys, expert witnesses and other legal bodies, according to officials. They are predicted to only rise as Arias awaits a second panel of jurors to decide her sentence.

In May, Arias was convicted of brutally stabbing and shooting to death her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, who was found dead in a pool of . blood in the shower of his home in Mesa, Arizona, in 2008. However, the jury failed to reach a verdict on her sentence, according to USA Today. Now, a retrial of the penalty phase, featuring a new panel of jurors, has been set for March 17 - with Arias facing either life in prison or the death penalty.

So far, taxpayers have forked out almost $2.2million on the costs, county spokesman Cari Gerchick told The Associated Press. However, county attorney Bill Montgomery has refused to disclose how much money has been spent on the high-profile case. Guilty: Arias will either spend her life behind bars, or be eligible for release after 25 years . During the murder, Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds to his body, was shot in the head and had his throat slit so deeply he was almost decapitated. Arias initially denied any involvement - even calling Alexander in the days after the killing and leaving friendly messages on his voicemail. But two years after her arrest, she eventually admitted to killing him - but said it was in self-defense. She said she recalled Alexander attacking her in fury for dropping his camera after a day of sex at his home. However, the jury found Arias guilty of first-degree murder - a verdict they delivered . four months after the trial first began. At the time, the case captured headlines across the world - garnering daily coverage from cable news networks, and spawning a virtual cottage industry for talk shows. Arias even used her notoriety to sell artwork she made in jail. However, for the retrial, the judge will be limiting media coverage in a bid to avoid the same publicity. If the second panel of jurors fails to reach a unanimous decision, the death penalty will no longer be considered. Instead, Arias will either spend her life behind bars, or be eligible for release after 25 years.","Jodi Arias convicted in May of killing her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 19:07 EST, 28 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:08 EST, 28 January 2014 . The number patients aged over 90 having to be taken to A&E by ambulance has soared by 80 per cent in just three years. Some 300,370 were brought in to hospital accident and emergency units last year, up from 165,910 in 2009/10. MPs and campaigners say cuts to social care budgets and failures by GP services mean the elderly are not being properly looked after at home. Surge: The number elderly patients rushed to A&E has surged since 2009 . A lack of home help and inadequate monitoring by doctors, practice nurses and – in some cases – families has left them prone to falls, fractures, infections and sudden problems with long-term complaints such as heart failure. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that overall, 21.7million people attended A&E last year, up from 21.5million in 2011/12. But the increase was starkest among the over-90s brought in by ambulance, up from 275,883 in 2011/12 to 300,370 last year. There is concern that many are having to wait in ambulances outside A&E because hospital staff are too busy to attend to them immediately. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘The Government’s severe cuts to social care have left thousands of older people without the support they need, at risk of going into hospital and getting trapped there.’ However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has pledged to bring back the traditional role of family doctor overseeing the care of elderly patients round the clock to stop them ending up in A&E. Concern: Age UK warned that increases in hospital visits can be a result of poor car at home . In an article for the Mail in November, he promised to give the over-75s a named GP familiar with their conditions. He said yesterday: ‘Labour’s disastrous 2004 GP contract left many vulnerable elderly patients without good out-of-hours care, so it’s rank hypocrisy for them now to complain about the consequences of their historic mistake. We have ripped up that contract and are bringing back proper family doctoring.’ Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘In some cases being admitted to hospital is the consequence of not getting good-quality care at home. 'The core of the problem is that funding for social care has failed and is still failing to keep up with growing demand. ‘The care of our most vulnerable must be a priority.” Consultants had feared this winter would be one of the worst on record for A&E units facing a shortage of doctors and a steady rise in patients. Promise: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has pledged to bring back 'proper family doctoring' But most departments have been far less busy than anticipated, partly due to mild weather and low levels of flu and the norovirus stomach bug. However, Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, warned that ‘the system remains fragile’. He said: ‘That is why we are working with NHS England and the Government to deliver . . . efficient long-term solutions.’ The figures also show patients aged 20 to 24 are more likely to go to A&E than other groups – which campaigners say is because they are pushier and expect to be treated immediately. They comprise 8.6 per cent of all attendances, compared with the 50 to 54 age group, for example, who make up 5 per cent, and the 70 to 74 group at 3.5 per cent. Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘This is the demanding generation who want a cure now. They are more pushy. ‘They may also be far more familiar with A&E units than they are with GP out-of-hours services or walk-in centres.’ He added: ‘If only the elderly were more pushy.’","MPs and campaigners blame budget cuts and failures by GP services .

Whenever there is nothing happening, Lewis Hamilton usually provides the entertainment. He can be exceedingly good and occasionally frustrating, but he is never boring. Bless him, because the new era of turbo-charged V6 engines began quietly here in sunny Jerez with more action in the garages than out on the track. But just before lunchtime on the first day of this pre-season test, Hamilton left skid marks on the pit-lane after his gleaming Mercedes failed on him, and he plunged into the tyre wall at the first turn. Stalled start! Lewis Hamilton loses control of his Mercedes on the first day of testing in Jerez . Deja vu? Hamilton's new car ploughs into the barrier, a similar thing happened on day one of testing last year . Safe and sound: Hamilton emerges from his Mercedes unscathed, although his pride may have been damaged . Back to the garage: Engineers set about returning Hamilton's brand new Mercedes to the pits . Lewis Hamilton also crashed out on his first day of testing with Mercedes last year. The British driver lost control and careered into a tyre wall just 15 laps into his first session in Jerez. According to eye witnesses, debris . was strewn along the straight. It was estimated Hamilton was travelling . at 160mph when his machinery disintegrated. 'Front-wing . failure,' confirmed Mercedes spokesman Bradley Lord, soon after a truck . had transported the damaged chassis back to the team's spanner . collection. 'The cause is being investigated.' Off track! Hamilton's Mercedes skid marks can be seen heading towards the barrier . Road recovery: Hamilton's new car is removed from the track for the problem to be investigated . Quick clean up: Mercedes staff collect parts of the car left at the crash site . Debris: What appears to be the failed right wing is left on the track . That . was Hamilton's 18th and inescapably final lap of the day. Mercedes' 'Keep Fighting' message to Michael Schumacher, who lies in a coma after a . skiing accident at the end of last year, was seen no more. Uninjured . himself, Hamilton spoke later, looking downbeat. He periodically . displays this countenance, not always for a reason that is obvious. Perhaps the car was not as good as he had hoped, perhaps he was annoyed . to be sitting out the session. Who knows? His answers were unrevealing. To . the chagrin of his team, the headline news was Hamilton's smash, . whereas, in fact, their car was encouragingly the first to run and, . despite the setback, they completed more laps than any rival bar . Ferrari, for whom Kimi Raikkonen was the quickest performer of the day. It . was a day of very limited running: the teams combined completed just 93 . laps, compared to 657 on the equivalent day last year. Reliability problems? Mercedes have blamed Hamilton's crash on a 'front wing failure' Test drive: Hamilton takes his new car for a spin on the Spanish circuit as he gears up for a championship challenge . In the spotlight: Hamilton poses for the cameras before heading out on to the circuit . McLaren . and Marussia did not turn a wheel in anger, and Red Bull's world . champion Sebastian Vettel managed just three laps as dusk fell, none of . them timed, after 'a silly mistake' delayed their progress. Fitting . the new powertrains, complete with their mind-bending energy recovery . systems, was clearly proving a tricky task for all concerned. McLaren, . who suffered an electrical problem, are rotating shifts of workers . through the dark of night. Cups of coffee and bags of nuts are at the . ready. But, on the . upside, the significant change in rules mean that Formula One is at the . cutting-edge of technology again, where it belongs.  Other than the lack . of action, there were two major debating points here. Leading the way: The returning Kimi Raikkonen was fastest on the opening day of winter testing . The . first was over the shape of the new noses. Ugly, say some, but do they . really frighten the horses? I think we'll become accustomed to them in . time. More concerning . was the view of Adrian Newey, Red Bull's design guru, who thinks that . the lower snouts could be dangerous. He said: 'Cars now can effectively . ""submarine"". If you hit the back of a car square on then you go . underneath and you end up with a rear crash structure in your face.' The second debate was over the sound of the new engines: loud or enough or not? Nobody drove flat out on Tuesday so . we did not get the full answer, but, still, they are definitely quieter . (as was inevitable because sound energy is now being recycled rather . than emitted as a banshee scream as it was on the old 2.4litres petrol . engines). The result . is a resonant growl in a lower register. There is a hint of an old, . chain smoker's throaty rasp to it. I prefer the new 'music' and it is . undoubtedly less injurious to one's eardrums.","Lewis Hamilton completed 18 laps before the 160mph crash at Turn 1 .

Failing to get a good night's sleep can make cancer more aggressive and speed its growth, researchers have claimed. They say that sleep disturbed by constant waking can make a noticeable difference in just four weeks. The researchers say the key is damage to the immune system, dampening its ability to control or eradicate early cancers. Researchers say the discovery could lead to new treatments for cancer - but warn people to 'take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account' Researchers experimented with genetically engineered mice that had been injected with tumor cells. As the mice slept during the day, a quiet, motorized brush moved through half of the cages every two minutes – forcing some of the mice to wake up and go back to sleep. The other mice were not disturbed as they slept. After just four weeks, the researchers found that the tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns were twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally. In a study published in the journal Cancer Research, researchers experimented with genetically engineered mice that had been injected with tumor cells. As the mice slept during the day, a quiet, motorized brush moved through half of the cages every two minutes – forcing some of the mice to wake up and go back to sleep. The other mice were not disturbed as they slept. After just four weeks, the researchers found that the tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns were twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally. The study is the first to demonstrate, in an animal model, the direct effects of fragmented sleep on tumor growth and invasiveness, and it points to a biological mechanism that could serve as a potential target for therapy. 'It’s not the tumor, it’s the immune system,' said David Gozal, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital, who led the study. 'Fragmented sleep changes how the immune system deals with cancer in ways that make the disease more aggressive. 'Fortunately, our study also points to a potential drug target,' he said. The lead researcher on the project said: 'The take home message is to take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account.' 'Toll-like receptor 4, a biological messenger, helps control activation of the innate immune system. 'It appears to be a lynchpin for the cancer-promoting effects of sleep loss. 'The effects of fragmented sleep that we focused on were not seen in mice that lacked this protein.' 'This study offers biological plausibility to the epidemiological associations between perturbed sleep and cancer outcomes,' Gozal said. 'The take home message is to take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that about 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. 'Considering the high prevalence of both sleep disorders and cancer in middle age or older populations,' the authors wrote, 'there are far-reaching implications.' Their next step is to determine whether sleep affects metastasis or resistance to cancer chemotherapy.","Tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally .

A couple came within 48 hours of losing their grand-daughter forever after social workers put her up for adoption. Lee and Katrina Parker told how social workers, operating behind the cover of the notoriously secretive family courts, were ‘hell-bent’ on handing the baby to strangers. In an extraordinary ruling, in which they were denied guardianship of the then three-month-old, they were also excluded from all future proceedings while the adoption went ahead. Forced adoption: Now two years old, India Parker was almost taken away from her grandparents Katrina and Lee (pictured) despite them offering her a loving home. They claim social workers were 'hell-bent' on giving her away . Prejudice: The Parkers claim social workers made 'assumptions' about their working-class family because they had seven children, six of whom lived at home, saying their grandchild would 'become lost' among them. They were granted a last-minute reprieve only after they discovered they had a 14-day window to appeal. The Parkers claim social workers made ‘assumptions’ about their working-class family because they had seven children – six of whom lived at home – commenting that their grandchild, India, would ‘become lost’ among them. Mrs Parker, 39, said: ‘Social services walked into our lives with preconceptions and did not have any intention of revising those prejudices. ‘We are not a conventional family, some of our children have been home-schooled, and I don’t think they liked that. ‘But we knew we were capable of giving India a loving home. Too big? India (far left) with five of the couple's seven children, which social workers said was too many to give her a loving home - from left, Stanley (nine), Honey (five), Hollly (13), Autumn (11) and Bluebell (five) Loving: India (centre) with, from left, her new siblings Bluebell, Honey, Holly, Autumn and Stanley . ‘They never intended to take the time to get to know us or the children.’ The couple can only now finally tell their story after the judge released his judgment, more than 13 months later. In the ruling, made in November 2012, Judge Newton said he was ‘deeply troubled by what occurred’ and criticised the ‘manifestly unjust’ decision by Essex County Council to exclude the ‘interested and committed grandparents’. He said by denying the couple the right to a fair hearing, the council had breached their human rights. Anger: The couple only realised they could appeal the ruling with days to spare . The Parkers, who live in Colchester, were given full custody of India, now two, the daughter of their eldest child, last August. Former retail manager Mr Parker, 40, said: ‘We nearly lost our granddaughter to strangers because social services were hell-bent on having India adopted, but we were unable to talk about it because it happened in secret. ‘There is a misconception grandparents have automatic rights, but they don’t. ‘Social services have too much power and the secret courts assist them to behave in any way they wish, because there is no recourse. There is no one to scrutinise their decisions.’ The couple’s story has emerged in the same month Lord Justice Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court, announced that future judgments in the family courts and the Court of Protection must be made public except where there is a clear reason why not. It follows a series of major scandals exposed by the Mail over the past year in which justice was conducted behind closed doors. India was taken into care in February 2012 when her 19-year-old single mother suffered mental health problems. When the Parkers belatedly discovered this, they applied for guardianship. But assessments by social workers at their home in April and July that year raised ‘anxieties’ about the Parkers, including that their family was too large. In October 2012, social services told the court it intended to find a ‘permanent secure placement away from the birth family’ for India. They refused the Parkers’ application, citing ‘chaotic and hectic living arrangements and the current physical limitations that the [Parkers’] house represents’. Family: Without time to assemble a legal argument, the couple appealed with no lawyers to help - and won . But they went even further, dismissing the Parkers from all future proceedings after claiming there was ‘no further role for them’. Plans were made for India’s adoption, but the Parkers discovered the 14-day window to appeal. They were, however, on day ten. With no legal representation or legal aid, they appealed two  days before the deadline. Judge Newton immediately quashed the previous ruling. In his judgment, he said: ‘This court is dismayed by what occurred. It was manifestly unjust, not just to the grandparents but to [India] and could in no way be thought to be ECHR [European Court of Human Rights] compliant. ‘We are dealing with interested and committed grandparents and the law could not be clearer.’ The Parkers have seven children, aged 21 to five, but say it is ‘insulting’ for social workers to suggest they received less love or attention than an only child. The couple already take their children to ballet and drama classes, with some appearing in adverts and films . They take their youngest to ballet and . drama classes every week and five of their children, Holly, 13, Autumn, . 11, Stanley, nine, and five-year-old twins Honey and Bluebelle have . appeared in adverts and even Hollywood films, including The Invisible . Woman, starring Ralph Fiennes. India has now settled into her grandparents’ four-bedroom semi-detached house and sees her mother, now 21, once a month. Mrs Parker said: ‘Losing India would have been as close to a bereavement as you can get.’ An Essex County Council spokesman said: ‘This case involved very complex and finely balanced decisions... As the case progressed, the  council was able to change its position to support the grandparents.’ The Parkers deny that Essex ever switched its support in their favour. The council is already embroiled in another high-profile family court row, after Alessandra Pacchieri, a 35-year-old Italian, was forced to undergo a caesarean by the secretive Court of Protection, so her baby could be taken into care.","Baby girl was taken into care because of her mother's mental health issues .

A new generation of ultra-thin, bendable mobile phones are being developed - inspired by the humble cuttlefish. Known as the chameleons of the marine world, cuttlefish can change the colour and texture of their skin, even disguising themselves as floating seaweed as they stalk their prey. It is this remarkable natural ability scientists hope to harness to develop paper-like flexible displays that can be rolled up like a cigarette. Known as the chameleons of the marine world, cuttlefish can change the colour and texture of their skin, even disguising themselves as floating seaweed as they stalk their prey . They have found the cuttlefish relies on optical properties that change thanks to nerve-controlled pigments in cells called chromatophores. Bright red proteins in these chromatophores may open the door to foldable, and even wearable screens, reports the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Dr Kevin Kit Parker, of Harvard University, said: ‘Our data suggest visible colouration in the S. officinalis chromatophore is facilitated by the nanostructure and composition of the pigment granules themselves. Mobile manufacturers are already working on flexible displays such as this prototype Windows smartphone unveiled last year. MIT researchers hope their work could lead to more advanced screens that are so flexible they can be rolled up like cigarettes . The skin of cuttlefish have cells containing striped structures. These structures have a layer of pigmented sacs called chromatophores as well as a layer of reflecting plates called iridophores. By contracting and relaxing muscles attached to chromatophores they can control the amount of pigment revealed. Finding ways to mimic this optical trickery has received a lot of attention in recent years. As well as the team at Harvard University, a group at the University of Bristol recently created artificial muscles and chromatophores using elastic plastic material that responds to an electrical stimulus. ‘This hierarchy enables the cuttlefish to produce a wide variety of body patterns that function in signalling displays or camouflage.’ He added that materials capable of changing colour in displays are coveted for consumer electronics, as well as camouflaging paints, textiles and cosmetics. Cuttlefish and other such ‘cephalopods’ - a class of molluscs which also include octopuses and squids - can provide a biological model. ‘Cuttlefish possess neutrally-controlled, pigmented chromatophore organs that allow rapid changes in skin patterning and colouration in response to visual cues,’ said Dr Parker. ‘Examination of cephalopods, similar to the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, can elucidate the basic biological, chemical and optical functionalities necessary to provide design rules for novel high performance colourants required in adaptive, flexible displays.’ Prototypes of flexible smartphones have already been attracting crowds at gadget shows. Researchers are also working on bendable and transparent displays and surfaces that could in future be part of flexible tablets, TVs and solar cells.

A 19-year-old missing woman who was the prime suspect of a homicide investigation into the death of her 52-year-old pizza shop boss in Kansas has been located in Florida and charged with his first-degree murder. Sarah Brooke Gonzales McLinn had been living with her boss, Harold M. Sasko - the owner of three Cici's pizza restaurant franchises in Kansas - at his home in Lawrence, near Topeka. She is now facing the death penalty, with court documents alleging she acted with premeditation in killing Sasko, whose body was found beaten to death at the home they shared on January 19. Sasko's ex-girlfriend, Kimberly Qualls, told PEOPLE she was dating him when, in 2012, Sasko told her McLinn was coming to stay with him so he could help her with drug problems and get her away from friends in gangs. Charged: Sarah Brooke Gonzales McLinn, 19, is accused of killing her boss and housemate, Harold Sasko, who owned and ran three pizza shops in Topeka, Kansas. She had been missing for six days before police found and arrested her in Florida . Victim: Harold M. Sasko, 52, was found beaten to death with 'an edged instrument' at his home in Lawrence, Kansas, which he shared with 19-year-old employee Sarah McLinn. Police he had been subdued before his death . Scene: The body of Harold Sasko was found here, at his house in Lawrence, Kansas, on January 19. His car and housemate were missing . Qualls told the magazine Sasko was a spiritual man who 'liked to help people' and that she feared something bad would come of the situation. Police say Sasko had been subdued and was unconscious when he was killed. While details of the death remain unclear, police have said the murder weapon was 'an edged instrument'. 'Based upon our investigation, evidence suggests Ms. McLinn gained control over Mr. Sasko and then killed him,' court documents obtained by KCTV allege. Sasko's body was discovered after police went to his house looking for McLinn, whose family had reported her missing when she failed to make a meeting with her sister, Ashley. Sasko's car was missing but McLinn's was at the house. A search then started for McLinn, with authorities initially saying they did not whether she was a victim or a suspect in the crime. Sarah McLinn is now facing the death penalty after being arrested and charged with the murder of Harold Sasko . It wasn't until Saturday, January 25, six days after the murder, that she was found inside Sasko's 2008 Nissan Altima in Florida. A federal park ranger noticed the car parked at a campground in Everglade National Park in Dade County, some 1,560 miles from the crime scene. After running the plates, he realized the vehicle was linked to a murder case and called for back up. McLinn was arrested without incident. She was found in possession of a controlled substance, police said. Authorities believe that McLinn was living in Sasko's car at the park.

Lawrence Police Chief Tarik Khatib (left) and Douglas County District Attorney Charles Branson discuss the filing of murder charges against Sarah McLinn during a press conference on Monday January 27, 2014 . McLinn was believed to be alone but Sasko's dog, Oliver, was with her in the car. Authorities in Dade County dropped the drug charge and the first-degree murder charge was filed in Douglas County on Sunday. An extradition hearing for McLinn has yet to be scheduled. If she waives extradition, she could be back in Kansas by next week. McLinn's family had said they feared her safety and believed she was a victim. They had sought her safe return.","Harold M.

Appeal: Richard Durkin arriving at the Supreme Court today as he battles for compensation from HFC Bank . A man who has bankrupted himself by spending £250,000 on legal fees in a 16-year court battle over a laptop today took his case to the Supreme Court in a bid to claw back the money from banking giant HSBC. Richard Durkin, a 44-year-old father of two, claims that HFC Bank ruined his credit rating after he tried to back out of an agreement to buy a computer from PC World for £1,499. In an earlier hearing, a court ordered the bank to pay him more than £100,000 in damages, but after that decision was reversed he has launched a new appeal at the highest court in Britain. Mr Durkin, an offshore construction surveyor, bought the laptop from the Aberdeen branch of PC World in 1998, paying a £50 deposit and signing a £1,499 credit agreement with HFC - now part of HSBC - for the remainder. He claims he was told he could get a refund if he had a problem with the computer, but when he complained that it did not have an inbuilt modem a manager said he could not have his money back. Although PC World eventually relented, HFC told Mr Durkin he was obliged to carry on making payments, arguing that the credit agreement was legally unrelated to the purchase of the computer. He was put on a credit blacklist until 2005, which he believes prevented him from buying a new home in Spain. Mr Durkin insisted all along that the credit agreement with HFC was dependent on the purchase of the laptop, meaning that it was void as soon as he returned the computer. In 2008, Aberdeen Sheriff Court ruled that he was entitled to cancel the agreement and awarded him damages of £116,000, but two years later the ruling was overturned at the court of session in Edinburgh. Today Mr Durkin opened his appeal at the Supreme Court in London, which is reserved for cases 'of the greatest constitutional importance'. Speaking before the case, Mr Durkin said it was 'too late' to give in and concede defeat in the 16-year case. Claim: Mr Durkin has bankrupted himself thanks to the legal bills incurred in his 16-year court case . 'It's too late for me to throw in the towel now, and besides, I'm a very determined chap,' he told MailOnline. 'I've spent so much on lawyers I'm bankrupt already - I might as well go bankrupt for doing the right thing. 'Until you get a credit blacklisting you have no idea how much damage it can do - it has wrecked my life. At first I thought I would just take it like a man, but a bad credit rating affects everything.  I can't do anything. 'It's no longer about the money for me - it's the principle. Why should these companies and banks be allowed to get away with treating consumers like this?' Andrew Smith QC, representing Mr Durkin, told the Supreme Court today: 'This case is when a consumer goes into a credit or debit agreement and whether he has the right to leave that agreement. 'We have the surprising situation from the consumer's point of view that he paid for something he no longer has'. Court: The case has now reached the Supreme Court in London and is being heard in front of five senior judges . Refund: Mr Durkin bought a laptop from PC World in 1998, but tried to return it the next day . But Lord Sumption replied: 'The credit agreement is conditional of that deal and continues to exist upon sale or transaction. 'Otherwise we have a rather strange conclusion that the price of the computer is paid by way of advance to the supplier of the goods'. Outlining HFC Bank's case to the panel of five justices, Alistair Clark QC said: 'The creditor has advanced a sum of money on behalf of the consumer, £1,449, to the supplier. 'So the supplier has parted with the goods to the consumer who now owns the goods. 'The consumer rejects the laptop in this case and he says he has rescinded the contract. The supplier says there is no basis for that. 'The question must be what is the basis for the consumer rescinding the credit agreement?' Lord Sumption said that Mr Durkin's credit contract with HFC Bank seemed to be dependent upon there being an ongoing sales contract with PC World, which had already been 'lawfully' terminated. '£1,449 is paid by the creditor to the supplier towards the price of a laptop under the contract of sale', the judge said. It would seem to me on the face of it that there was a right to rescind'. He added: 'You have lawful rescission so the money, on the face of it, has to be paid back from the supplier to the creditor who paid it. That surely is the only and inevitable conclusion'. The panel reserved judgement on the case.","Richard Durkin, 44, bought laptop in 1998 but returned it the next day because it did not have a modem .

Dave Lee Travis admitted yesterday he has ‘fallen into temptation’ – but insisted he had never forced himself on a woman. During his second day in the witness box, the former Radio 1 DJ appeared to confess to cheating on his wife of 42 years Marianne. Travis was asked by his barrister Stephen Vullo if he had ‘on occasion fallen into temptation’. The 68-year-old replied: ‘I don’t like the fact this is being said. Well yes, of course I’ve fallen once or twice. Consensual, I may add.’ Travis added: ‘I don’t force myself on women ... I’m sorry, that’s just not me.’ The former BBC star had earlier been accused of pinching the bottom of the girl as he introduced a song by The Smurfs as the cameras rolled. The woman’s friend later accused producers of editing out the incriminating footage. But Travis, 68, today told Southwark Crown Court his career would have been killed 'stone dead' if he had asked for the footage - shot in the late 1970s - to be cut. He said: 'That wouldn’t happen. I do not have the power you see here. 'I’m probably the lowest of the low as far as the production team and bosses are concerned. We were just the DJs to them. We couldn’t ask for anything. Anything.' He was asked by his defence barrister, Stephen Vullo, who he would have to ask for the clip to be edited. He said he would have to ask the top editors and producers at Top Of The Pops to edit out the sequence. Travis told jurors: 'It is difficult for me to answer that, no such thing happened. Travis told the court his career would have been killed 'stone dead' if he had asked for the footage - shot in the late 1970s - to be cut . 'I would have to go to the man at the . very top of the BBC, somebody like John Birt. It is such a ridiculous . thing to ask, nobody would do that. It’s the BBC for goodness sake.' Asked what the effect would be on his career, Travis said: 'It would have killed it stone dead. 'So . many would have been involved in that, you just can’t play around with . these people. You can’t mess with something like the BBC - its simply . not done.' He . branded the allegation 'insane' and said he would never have groped . anyone while the cameras were rolling and with the audience in full . view. Travis said: 'That is a completely insane claim, and it’s especially insane as I’ve seen the video.' He rubbished claims he had groped a girl, adding: 'We are surrounded by the audience and cameras and people. That’s not good for my career. 'If I had been caught doing that in the Top Of The Pops studio I should have thought that the book would have been thrown at me and I would have been out of the BBC.' He told jurors: 'I did not sexually attack, put my hands on these girls or anything like that at any time.' Travis, who is on trial at London’s . Southwark Crown Court accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and . sexually assaulting another, denies all the offences against him. When . claims he molested a British Airways employee under the table and in . front of company bosses at a work party were put to him, he retorted: . 'Am I allowed to laugh? Because I’m sorry, it’s a situation which did . not happen.' Travis said he took his job seriously and that, even though working in showbusiness was fun, 'it is a business nevertheless' Travis, from Buckinghamshire, denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his career. Appearing under his birth name David Griffin, the alleged offences occurred when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while appearing on Top Of The Pops and when starring in panto. Travis, who chose to sit down to give his evidence, said he took his job seriously and that, even though working in showbusiness was fun, 'it is a business nevertheless'. Wearing a maroon blazer, white shirt . and patterned tie, he said he did not like being asked whether he had . ever cheated on his wife, to whom he has been married since 1971. But questioned further by Mr Vullo if he had ever 'fallen into temptation', Travis admitted he had 'once or twice'. 'Of course, I’m human,' he told the court. 'Consensual, if I might add.' A sketch of Travis giving evidence in his own defence at the court yesterday . Travis asked jurors to 'think logically about it'. He went on: 'If these women supposedly are chasing after me because I was the pop star of the day, the question would have to be, why would I go and assault somebody? 'I don’t like the idea of assaulting women in any way, shape or form.' Asked . about claims that he put his hand up a woman’s skirt in front of the . organiser of a Norwich Union event he was working at, Travis said he . 'should be committed somewhere' if that had happened because it would . have been bad for business. 'And it didn’t, by the way,' he added. The . court heard that he was alleged to have indecently assaulted a woman . who was working as a stage hand on a pantomime he featured in. Travis, who is on trial at London's Southwark Crown Court (pictured) accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another, denies all the offences against him . 'This is what has been doing my head in about this case, it’s the numbers,' he told jurors. 'It’s because there are quite a few complaints against me that this is any way important to people. 'I hate this idea that there is no smoke without fire. 'I can only say what I know and the way I feel about things. 'If I had been caught doing that in the . Top Of The Pops studio I should have thought that the book would have . been thrown at me and I would have been out of the BBC' - Dave Lee Travis . 'If I had sexually assaulted this girl in my dressing room, I would fully expect her to go and tell her boss and the boss would tell the person running the panto and that would immediately get me in big trouble.' He dismissed the idea that she would have decided not to complain because he was a celebrity. 'You are never too big in this industry, you can be knocked over very quickly and I don’t believe in taking risks with my business and I certainly don’t believe in attacking young girls,' he said. Asked about his relationship with the Chuckle Brothers, who also featured in the pantomime, he said that they were 'all showbizzy friends'. 'They were the comedy duo and I was the butt of all their jokes,' he said. Travis denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his career . Travis was asked about his interest in . photography in relation to evidence heard about a picture he took of a . female pop star in a bikini. 'I will not have them called sleazy,' he said. He was also questioned about allegations that he grabbed the breasts of a female journalist who came to interview him at his house after asking if she would pose for photographs. Mr Vullo asked if they were true. 'No, of course not,' he said. 'I’m not likely to get somebody to agree to do a photograph with me if I’m putting my hands all over them. It’s just not the way it works.' He also denied claims heard yesterday that he groped another journalist. 'After this I will never have an interview with a female again without somebody else sitting there with me,' he said. 'It just breaks my heart.' Travis was asked about allegations that he assaulted a teenager in his Radio 1 studio during a live broadcast but said he could not remember any such incident. 'This is just lies, out and out,' he said. 'I don’t have to recall that as it never happened.' Asked if he could have got away with such behaviour while working at the BBC, Travis said: 'I keep saying this, Mr Vullo. 'Yes, my position was quite high up within the echelons of DJs but nobody is bigger than the station - ever.' The trial was adjourned until 10.30am tomorrow, when Travis will continue to be questioned.","Dave Lee Travis accused of groping teenage girl on Top Of The Pops .

She has strongly denied the claims . A high-flying female headteacher has returned to court over claims she abused a young boy more than 20 years ago. Anne Lakey oversaw the steepest improvement in GCSE results at any school in the country when she was chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools. The federation, which runs two secondary schools in County Durham, previously suspended the 54-year-old while an investigation was carried out. Today Lakey appeared for the first time before a crown court where a date was set for her trial. She faces eight charges of abusing the same boy under the age of 16 during a 12-month period in the late 1980s. During a previous hearing before magistrates earlier this month, she pleaded not guilty to all eight charges. Her barrister told the court: 'She strongly denies these allegations.' Lakey is accused of two counts of inciting a boy under 16 to commit an act of gross indecency, two counts of gross indecency on a boy under 16 and four counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16. During today's short hearing Lakey, dressed in a navy dress and jacket, spoke only to confirm her name. A trial will take place at Durham Crown Court on June 23 and is due to last four days. Lakey, from Stanley, County Durham, was given unconditional bail until her next plea and case management hearing on April 17, 2014. The federation where she was chief runs Durham Community Business College in Ushaw Moor and Fyndoune Community College in Sacriston. Accused: Anne Lakey, who oversaw the biggest improvement in GCSE results in the country . Success: Good grades at Fyndoune College, pictured, went from 28 per cent to 80 per cent in four years . The federation where Lakey was chief executive also ran Durham Community Business College, pictured . Fyndoune serves 350 pupils from 13 former mining villages and last year was named the country's most improved secondary school. Just 26 per cent of pupils achieved five A* to C grades including English and Maths at GCSE in 2008, but by 2012 the figure had soared to 80 per cent. At the time the school credited a strict focus on teaching standards and staff training. Principal Trevor Dunn said at the time: â€˜We worked very hard across the two schools to have a curriculum that was engaging and exciting. It was clear students have to want to come to school andwant to work. â€˜We have a construction centre so we can do construction courses and we have a farm so we can do courses in animal care and horse care.â€™ .","Anne Lakey 'strongly denies' eight charges against a boy under 16 .

A managing director who asked his openly gay employee if he had AIDS when he saw that he was ill at work dismissed the question as 'office banter' at an employment tribunal hearing. Office manager Jack Howell, 36, said he was 'mortified' when his boss Peter Chambers made the comment after he had came out of the toilet looking pale and sweating. Mr Chambers, who founded Chambers Waste . Management Plc in 1964, accepted at the hearing today that the AIDS . comment was 'inappropriate' but said it was part of 'office banter' at . the firm of 120 people he runs with his wife Emma. Inappropriate: Office manager Jack Howell, 36, (left) told an employment tribunal he was 'mortified' when his boss Peter Chambers (right) asked if he had AIDS. Mr Chambers said the comment was part of 'office banter' He also admitted calling Mr Howell a 'c*** sucker' in a phone call to his wife, but said he was not his 'usual self' that day as he had been at a coroner’s inquest into the death of his father who had died in an accident months earlier. The company denied discriminating against Mr Howell and counter-claimed that he had made disparaging comments about Mrs Chambers in a Facebook post. The tribunal heard Mr Howell had been working as the skip office manager at the recycling and waste management firm for almost three years when his relationship with Mr and Mrs Chambers soured. In April last year, Mr Howell fell ill and was diagnosed by his GP with Raynaud’s Phenomenon - a condition that affects the blood supply to parts of the body. He said: 'Although I had returned to work after my doctor’s appointment, I was still not feeling well and, as I was walking down the stairs, Mr Chambers said to me: ""What’s up with you?"" 'When I mentioned that I was feeling really rough, he commented: ""What’s wrong with you, is it AIDS?”' Under cross-examination, Mr Howell said he was 'mortified' by what his boss had said, adding: 'I was horrified. I’m a gay man and the stereotype is still there - that it is a gay illness.' Mr Howell claimed colleagues were shocked when he told them about the AIDS quip and that Mr Chambers started to ignore him from then on. He said he didn’t raise a formal grievance because his line manager was Mr Chambers’ wife Emma, who is finance director at the firm based in Guildford, Surrey. Mr Howell had been working as the skip office manager at Chambers Waste Management Plc for almost three years when his relationship with Mr Chambers and his wife Emma soured . The tribunal heard the company was struggling financially and had suffered a £150,000 loss in the year ending April 2013. Its fortunes have since improved. Mr Howell, who was responsible for selling skip hire, had suffered a drop in sales and was called to a meeting with Mrs Chambers on May 14 to discuss his falling revenues. It was alleged that later that day he called Mrs Chambers a 'retard' in a Facebook post, which was seen by her husband. The couple claimed they decided not to take action against their employee at the time because she was not mentioned by name. However, Mr Howell told the tribunal his online comment simply referred to him falling out with his drug-addicted brother - and was not about Mrs Chambers. Two weeks later, Mr Howell was called back into Mrs Chambers’ office and informed he was at risk of redundancy because the company no longer needed a skip office manager. Following a further consultation on June 3, Mr Howell accessed the company’s recorded phone logs and listened to calls made between Mr and Mrs Chambers - where he heard Mr Chambers refer to him as 'the c*** sucker'. The tribunal, in Reading, Berkshire, heard office phone calls were recorded for training purposes and could be accessed by supervisors. Mr Howell saved recordings of several key private conversations between the couple, and transcripts were put before Employment Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto at the tribunal. A recording of a call made on May 21 heard Mr Chambers tell his wife he wanted to put Mr Howell in 'an uncomfortable and embarrassing position' by making her report the Facebook comment to the police. No complaint was ever made. After Mr Howell was informed he was at risk of redundancy on May 28, the tribunal heard Mr Chambers phoned his wife to see how the meeting had gone. Claims: Mr Howell says Mr and Mrs Chambers had decided they wanted him to leave the company either because of his sexual orientation or his alleged misconduct . He said that Mr Chambers had referred to him using the slur when he asked his wife about the meeting. 'Mrs Chambers stated that I was ""oh, so nice. You would not believe it,"" and that I was ""good as gold"" in the meeting that day,' he said. 'That apparently surprised Mr Chambers who then commented, ""don’t they turn?"" Presumably he was referring to homosexuals.' Mr Howell, of Deepcut, Surrey, left the office on June 3. He was signed off work and prescribed anti-depressants before formally handing in his resignation on June 28. He told the tribunal panel his trust and confidence in the Chambers had 'ended' and that he was placed in an 'impossible situation.' 'Mr and Mrs Chambers had decided they wanted me to leave either because of my sexual orientation or my alleged misconduct,' he claimed. 'I could not stay in view of the homophobic comments made by Mr Chambers and the attempt to ease me out of the company on the false claim of redundancy.' Mr Chambers denied he was homophobic and dismissed Mr Howell’s claims that he had engineered the redundancy scheme to force him out of a job. Referring to the AIDS comment, Mr Chambers said: 'I saw Jack coming out of the toilet looking very pale and sweating. I asked him: ""Are you okay, Jack? You don’t look very well."" 'He laughed and replied that he was okay and then I asked him, jokingly: ""Christ, Jack, you haven’t got AIDS have you?"" 'With hindsight, I appreciate that this comment was inappropriate. However, this was a response to the way Jack looked and not a reference to his sexuality. 'It was only afterwards that it occurred to me that the comment could be taken as a reference to Jack being gay. At the time, it was not calculated at all.' Mr Chambers said Mr Howell did not raise a grievance and did not seem offended by his comment at the time. He said the office had a 'whimsical' atmosphere and 'many of our employees like to have a laugh and partake in office banter.' Turning to the comment about Mr Howell made to his wife he added: 'I understand that this phrase is offensive and inappropriate but at the time I was extremely emotionally distressed and I was speaking - I thought in private - to my wife. 'I regret my use of this phrase but I did not use it because of any prejudice against homosexuals, but rather as a general term of abuse. 'This comment does not accurately reflect how I really viewed Jack or acted towards him.' Giving evidence, Mrs Chambers said her husband’s words to describe Mr Howell was 'not deeply offensive in the world of transport.' She added: 'I think it had no reference to him (Mr Howell) being gay. I think he could have chosen his words better.' In her witness statement to the tribunal, Mrs Chambers said she did not know how Mr Howell had obtained the password to access the recordings, and that she felt her privacy had been 'violated'. However, Mr Howell said the phone recordings were readily accessible to all staff members. Mrs Chambers accepted that the company did not have a social media policy in place in regards to the Facebook post Mr Howell wrote on May 14. The tribunal continues.","Jack Howell was 'mortified' when Peter Chambers asked if he had AIDS .

June Humphreys, 76, from Crewe, admitted a string of shoplifting offences and told magistrates she did it because she was bored and lonely . A great-grandmother used her OAP bus pass to go on shoplifting sprees because she was bored with being old. Supported by her trusty shopping trolley, June Humphreys, 76, would walk into a store and wander down the aisles filling it with goods before walking off. During a four-year spree she travelled across two counties and tried to make off with items worth hundreds of pounds. Despite being repeatedly caught by security staff she continued on her shoplifting binge. A probation officer said Humphreys had clocked up as many shoplifting convictions as a teenage heroin addict. Following the latest series of thefts on January 6, she admitted stealing sweets and chocolate worth £2 from Iceland, baby clothes worth £69 from BHS, another batch of baby clothes worth £24.98 from a B&M store and even a breast pump from Boots. After arriving at North Staffordshire magistrates court pushing her shopping trolley, Humphreys pleaded guilty to stealing from four shops in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent. But the mother of seven escaped jail after telling magistrates that she stole only because she was bored by old age and having nothing to do. Humphreys lives alone in Crewe, Cheshire, and claimed she went out shoplifting because she had to do something to ‘fill the time’. She said she had little contact with her children or grandchildren. She has previous convictions for shop theft in 2011, 2012, 2013 and as recently as two weeks ago. Magistrates warned her that she will go to prison if she shoplifts again. Darren Vernon, a probation officer, told the hearing: ‘She has travelled around Staffordshire and Cheshire on public transport and committed offences. She knows what she is doing is wrong – she says she is bored and needs to fill her time. Time to fill: The mother of seven lives alone and suffers from breast cancer and osteoarthritis, magistrates were told. She was jailed for one month, suspended for a year . ‘She lives alone. She has seven . children but the only one she has contact with lives above her. She has . acquired the record of a heroin addict in his late teens.’ Store detectives would catch Humphreys red-handed but she simply refused to stop. Appearing . in court the pensioner admitted the thefts on January 6 and also . pleaded guilty to stealing alcohol, coffee and confectionery worth . £30.42 from an Aldi store and stealing two pairs of boots worth £94.50 . from a shoe shop in Hanley a week before Christmas. Mr Vernon told the court Humphreys had been ill. She was being treated for breast cancer and also suffered from osteoarthritis. Shoplifting: Macclesfield, pictured, was one of many towns where Humphreys went shoplifting . Leek in Staffordshire was another town the OAP used her bus pass to travel to so she could shoplift . He . recommended that the court give her one last chance and that if she . reoffended then a custodial sentence may be the only answer. Andrew Bennett, defending, said: ‘My client does not want to go to prison. She wants to stop stealing.’ Magistrates . revoked a community order that had previously been imposed on Humphreys . for theft and sentenced her to one month in prison suspended for 12 . months. She was also ordered to pay £45 costs and an £80 victim surcharge for the offences.","June Humphreys, 76, from Crewe, has a record 'like teenage heroin addict'

British in India records, genealogy site Findmypast.co.uk discovered . that the Prime Minister David Cameron (left) is a blood relative of pub . landlord comedian Al Murray (right) The British Raj was the British rule in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947. The system of governance was instituted in 1858, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown and lasted until 1947. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states, the Union of India (later the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the eastern half of which, still later, became the People's Republic of Bangladesh). The British Raj extended over almost all present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, with exceptions such as Goa. The ruler was Queen Victoria, who in 1876 was proclaimed Empress of India. Thackeray is also famous in his own right, as the 19th century poet and author of satirical novel Vanity Fair. Elsewhere, John Talbot Shakespear, David Cameron’s four times great grandfather and Thackeray’s uncle, was a senior civil servant with the East India Company. The records also reveal details about Charles and Robert Bruce, two Scottish brothers who established the first commercial tea plantation for the East India Company.

Kipling’s sister Trix’s wedding records were also found, as were inventories of Kipling’s estate. During another investigation into the 200-year records, the researchers found evidence of a close relationship between Napoleon Bonaparte and a young teenage girl called Betsy Balcombe.

Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn is joining the Today show as a correspondent for the Sochi Winter Games after she was forced to bow out of the competition due to an ongoing knee injury. The alpine skier is set to report daily in the U.S. on the early morning show and provide additional coverage for NBC Sports. Vonn, 29, appeared on the Today show on Tuesday from her home in Pensacola, Florida, with her new rescue dog Leo to discuss her recovery from a recent knee operation and her painful decision to skip Sochi. Scroll down for video . Champion skier Lindsey Vonn was joined by her rescue dog Leo on Tuesday as she spoke on the Today Show about her new role as the network's correspondent for the Sochi winter games . Ski champion Lindsey Vonn will be working for NBC as Olympic correspondent during the Sochi winter games but she won't be traveling to Russia . Vonn, who has been dating golfer Tiger Woods since last year, had a second surgery on her busted right knee earlier this month. She said: 'I feel okay, I've been through this once before so I know the drill. It's a bit complicated because it's pretty major surgery but I've been doing therapy and I'm alright.' The athlete was asked by Today show presenter Matt Lauer if she had the strength to go through another round of training and rehabilitation to return to competition level. Vonn said: 'I can do it. After . making the decision not to commit in Sochi, I've made the commitment to . race through to the next Olympics. I felt a bit rushed for Sochi but I'm going to be racing next year and the year after that and the year after that.' The Olympic skier said it was difficult to watch Team USA heading for Sochi and gearing up for the games. With . tears in her eyes, she told the Today show: 'It's going to be hard to . watch, it's already hard, you guys run commercials every two minutes. Vonn, 29, appeared emotional when she discussed her painful knee injury and decision not to compete in this year's Winter Olympics . Vonn put herself through a grueling, and often painful, rehab and training program after knee surgery last year but was forced to bow out of the Sochi Games because she was not ready to compete . 'It will be hard to watch the alpine events, I always watch the figure skating and the luge but it's hard to watch the alpine.' However the champion skier was excited about her new challenge as a TV presenter but added: 'I'm not looking forward to waking up this early.' Vonn revealed on January 7 that despite undergoing major surgery to repair her anterior cruciate ligaments 11 months ago, the same injury had once again flared up. In a statement, she said: 'I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level. Lindsey Vonn competes during the Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Women's Downhill in December in Val d'Isere, France. An ongoing knee problem, however, left her unable to compete at an Olympic level . 'I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February.

Now you can own the backdrop from the film Zero Dark Thirty for $7.5 million. The Blue Cloud Movie Ranch in California's Santa Clarita Valley specializes in sets that look like Afghanistan during time of war and are almost entirely accurate. The ranch has also been used as a backdrop in Iron Man and some episodes of True Blood in addition to the film Zero Dark Thirty, reports curbed.com.

The man who currently owns the property is a former stuntman named Rene Veluzat and he gets lots of requests to purchase the property so it will probably sell. 'I get 50 phone calls a day,' he told the L.A. Times last year. The land has multiple movie backdrops called the 'Foreign Courtyard,' 'The Cave,' 'Army Camp,' 'Helicopter Crash,' '50s Town,' and 'Third World Country.' Now these dilapidated sets can belong to you. It may look broken but it's rather expensive to purchase the Afghanistan inspired set . It's only $7.5 million to reserve a permanent space in this broken down home .

A brand new superyacht has been unveiled to the world for the first time ahead of being delivered to its new owner - Formula One mogul Eddie Jordan. The Sunseeker 155 has been under development for 18 months, and will cost a total of £32million when it is finally completed. This week it was taken out of the shed in Poole, Dorset where it is being built, as it is now too large to be housed in the hangar. Unveiled: The Sunseeker 155 superyacht, commissioned by Eddie Jordan, has been unveiled to the public . Under construction: The boat has been moved out of the shed where it was built because it is now too large . It was transported at a glacial place by a radio-controlled unit as it was manoeuvred out of the shed with just a few inches to spare. The four-deck yacht includes five bedrooms, enabling Mr Jordan to host up to 10 guests at once, while the boat also has space for 11 members of staff. Other perks include a nightclub, day room, 'beach club' and a panoramic viewing platform - which could allow guests a perfect view of the Monaco Grand Prix if Mr Jordan decides to attend the society event. The yacht is 155ft long and weighs a total of 200 tonnes, with a maximum speed of 22 knots (25mph), and can travel 4,000 nautical miles in a single journey. New owner: Eddie Jordan, pictured with Jenson Button, is paying £32million for the Sunseeker 155 . Emerging: The yacht was taken out of the shed on a radio-controlled system . Plans: These floor plans show the layout of the yacht, which includes five guest bedrooms and a nightclub . Sunseeker International, the company building the boat, expects to be able to begin testing it on the water next month, before delivering it to Mr Jordan in the spring. But even after the businessman has taken delivery of his new pride and joy, handing over £32million in the process, the Sunseeker 155 will not come cheap. Filling up the boat's 60,000-litre engine with diesel will cost £30,000 every time. Despite the gigantic scale of the Sunseeker 155, it is still very far from the record for the biggest yacht in the world - the Azzam, completed last year, measures almost 600ft. Glamorous: But the boat has a top speed of just 22 knots (25mph) due to its vast size . Vast: However, the 155ft yacht is still some way off the world record, which stands at a staggering 600ft . Stewart McIntyre, managing director at Sunseeker International, said: 'This is an extremely exciting time for Sunseeker as we inch ever closer to the completion of the 155 Yacht. 'This is the biggest project we have ever undertaken and since the announcement of its build it has been the talk of the industry. 'We are incredibly proud of what we have created and look forward to showcasing it to the world.' Mr Jordan, who commissioned the yacht, grew up in Ireland and ran a number of racing teams before setting up Jordan Grand Prix, whose drivers included Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill. After the team shut down in 2005, the 65-year-old became a racing commentator for the BBC. Last year it was revealed that the Emirati royal family own the world's biggest mega-yacht, knocking Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's off the top spot. The Chelsea owner's vessel Eclipse had been the world's biggest yacht for the past three years, but it was usurped by the 590ft Azzam, which Yachts France revealed belongs to Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nayan, President of the United Arab Emirates and Emir of Abu Dhabi and is worth £390million. The yacht requires a staff of 50, and interior features include a 29ft salon and a stunning, open-plan interior. Abramovich's Eclipse, valued at £740million, features an armour-plated master suite, two swimming pools, two helipads, a hall, a cinema, a mini-submarine and even its own missile defence system. It had in turn taken the title of world's biggest private yacht from the 454ft Rising Sun, owned by American businessman Larry Ellison, which topped the 414ft Octopus, owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Of the top 100 yachts featured in the Yachts France mega yacht league table, 31 were owned by people from the Middle East, 19 were Russian owned, and 17 belonged to Americans.","Sunseeker 155 emerges from hangar after 18 months in development .

Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic denounced the United Nations war crimes tribunal as a 'satanic court' today as he refused to testify as a defence witness on behalf of his one-time ally Radovan Karadzic. For many of the families of victims of Bosnian Serb atrocities it was the two men seen together for the first time in more than 17 years who had performed the work of Satan as thousands are said by war crimes prosecutors to have been murdered on their orders during the 1990s war in Bosnia. The extraordinary courtroom reunion at The Hague lasted only about an hour as Mladic repeatedly told judges he would not answer the former Bosnian Serb leader's questions, citing ill health and an unwillingness to risk incriminating himself. Reunion: Ratko Mladic (left) has refused to testify as a defence witness on behalf of his one-time ally Radovan Karadzic (right). Above, the pair are seen together for the first time in more than 17 years at The Hague today . The two men - one the military enforcer, the other the politican who dreamed of creating an ethnically-cleansed pure Serb state in Bosnia - exchanged greetings as they saw one another again in public. Both men had clearly aged but appeared unbowed displaying the same robust contempt for 'outsiders' they had in the years when their faces were known around the world. Mladic, 71, said by his lawyers to be suffering from a condition that affects his memory, apologised to 68 year-old Karadzic as he refused to give evidence on his behalf, telling him as he left court: 'Thanks a lot, Radovan. I'm sorry, these idiots wouldn't let me speak. They defend Nato bombs.' Defence lawyer Peter Robinson said that . Mladic was 'the one person in the whole world who knows best what . happened in the war in Bosnia' and that Karadzic was asking him to do . his best to testify and to tell what had occurred. Condemnation: Mladic, 71, said by his lawyers to be suffering from a condition that affects his memory, dubbed the Hague a 'satanic court' . Above, the former Bosnian Serb commander is pictured at court in 2011 . Allies: Mladic (left) and Karadzic (right), pictured in 1995, exchanged greetings as they saw one another today . Karadzic, who was captured in the Serbian capital Belgrade after years on the run, faces 11 charges, including genocide relating to the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995. Both men deny charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Dubbed the 'Butcher of Bosnia' after Srebrenica where more than 7,000 men and boys were executed, Mladic initially refused to take the oath, saying: 'Your subpoenas, your platitudes, your false indictments, I do not care one bit about any of it.' He added: 'This is a satanic court, which is putting on trial us Serbs because we are defending our people from you.' 'The Butcher of Bosnia': Mladic, pictured addressing his troops in Bosnia in 1995, initially refused to take the oath, saying: 'Your subpoenas, your platitudes, your false indictments, I do not care one bit about any of it' Horrific: Both men deny charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995. Above, women weep over caskets at a memorial centre following the massacre . In one moment of light relief and farce, . the hearing had to be delayed so that Mladic's dentures could be brought . from his cell in the tribunal's detention centre . The two former allies barely made eye contact during the hearing. Karadzic was businesslike - often looking down at documents on his desk. Mladic appeared to be enjoying the attention, waving to the packed public gallery and saluting judges as he left court. Going through the motions of the examination of a witness, Karadzic asked Mladic questions about the main allegations in their respective indictments, even though he knew the bullish general would refuse to answer. He asked if Mladic had ever informed him 'prisoners' in Srebrenica would be or had been executed, an apparent reference to the 1995 massacre of thousands of Muslim men and boys in the eastern enclave. He asked if the two leaders had agreed to subject residents of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, to a campaign of terror by shelling or sniping. He asked why Serb forces conducted shelling and sniping in Sarajevo and, finally, he asked if the Bosnian Serb leadership had a plan to expel Croats and Muslims from Serb-held territory during the war. On trial: Karadzic, who was captured in the Serbian capital Belgrade after years on the run, faces 11 charges . Mladic repeatedly read out a refusal he had printed on a sheet of paper, once telling judges he touched upon the Srebrenica massacre in his seven-page prepared statement they had refused to allow him to read in court. 'I think it would be interesting,' he told judges. As he stood up to leave, Mladic sardonically thanked judges for not letting him say what he wanted to say. 'You have confirmed my thesis that the Hague tribunal is not a court of law but a satanic court,' he said through a courtroom interpreter.","Ratko Mladic has refused to testify in court on behalf of Radovan Karadzic .

A toddler has defied the odds by recovering from an incredibly rare condition that left her body covered in bruises. Hannah Hutchinson was just four weeks old when she was diagnosed with a rare condition that affects just one in 100,000 children. She has Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, which leaves her suffering from tumours that dramatically deplete her blood platelet levels. Hannah Hutchinson (pictured with her parents, Vicki and James) has a rare and life-threatening condition that left her covered in huge bruises . It means her blood cannot clot so a simple cut or bruise could be life-threatening. The 19-month-old has to go to hospital every day and takes as many as ten different medications to control her condition. But specialists from Alder Hey Hospital, in Liverpool, believe they may have successfully treated the condition, and hope she can make a full recovery. Her mother, Vicki Hutchinson, first suspected something was wrong when Hannah was just one month old and she developed severe bruising on her stomach. She was rushed to A&E where doctors carried out a blood test and found that Hannah’s platelet count had dropped to a dangerously low level. Mother-of-four Mrs Hutchinson, 35, from Liverpool, said: ‘Hannah was born healthy and had a normal delivery - but when she was four weeks old I spotted a huge bruise on her belly while I was changing her nappy. Hannah had a tumour which depleted her platelet levels meaning her blood couldn't clot and she was at risk of a life-threatening bleed. She was diagnosed after developing a bruise on her stomach at one month old . Hannah (pictured in hospital) had to have surgery to remove the tumour but after the operation she started to bleed uncontrollably and ended up fighting for her life . ‘When you see something like that on your baby you think either someone has hurt her or that it is meningitis - so we rushed her straight to hospital. ‘The doctor’s thought that we had hurt Hannah at first, they didn’t know what was wrong with her. It wasn’t until they did a blood test that they noticed her platelets were very low. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a rare benign tumour of the blood vessels. It is not cancerous and does not spread around the body. It is often accompanied by a potentially serious condition called Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. This occurs when the tumour traps and destroys platelets in the child's body. This means the child's platelet levels are depleted so their blood cannot clot properly. As a result, they are at risk of dangerous bleeding. Source: Boston Children's Hospital . ‘If I hadn’t got her straight to hospital, or had ignored the bruising, she could have died that day.’ Hannah had an operation to remove a large tumour from her torso when she was four months old, but had to be rushed into hospital again after the wound began to bleed uncontrollably. Her parents, Vicki and her husband James, spent their first wedding anniversary at their daughter’s bedside as she fought for her life in hospital. Mrs Hutchinson said: ‘She was bleeding really heavily from the wound so we rushed her straight to hospital. ‘They gave her a blood transfusion and pumped platelets into her before she was hurried into the operating theatre. ‘We really thought we were going to lose her that day, but she has really been a little fighter.’ The condition, which only affects children, means that Hannah’s platelet levels drop from a normal level of between 150 to 400 to as low as 12. The toddler has already undergone countless operations and spent a lot of time in hospital, and is still required to visit the hospital for monitoring. Hannah (pictured with her parents, Vicki and James, and her siblings Bethany, Sian and Andrew) is now starting to recover and her doctors hope she will grow out of the condition as she gets older . Hannah has to take up to ten medicines a day (pictured) as well as going to hospital for regular check ups . But her parents are hopeful that she will continue to show signs of recovery, and eventually recover fully from the condition. Alder Hey Hospital’s consultant paediatric oncologist Professor Barry Pizer said: ‘It is a very rare condition that I believe affects only one in 100,000 people. ‘Sufferers get these vast vascular anomalies that affect their platelets in blood vessels and can lead to bleeding disorders, which are often life-threatening. Hannah's mother, Vicki, said: 'When Hannah was first diagnosed we felt so alone. All we wanted was to find another mum or dad to speak to, someone who understood how we felt' ‘We currently do not know what causes the bleeding, but it can be fatal. We have tried a number of treatments with Hannah and we believe her last - a neurotherapy known as sirolimus - has been successful and she will begin to develop at a normal rate for a child her age. ‘The syndrome can cause severe problems for people depending where it is located in the body - in this case it is in Hannah’s chest and abdominal area. We hope the condition will burn itself out and will provide support to prevent the condition deteriorating. ‘I know the impact has been huge on Hannah’s family, but we are working to help her make a full recovery.’ Mr and Mrs Hutchinson are currently raising money for cancer charity CLIC Sargent and want to raise awareness of the rare condition to help other families in a similar position. They said: ‘When Hannah was first diagnosed we felt so alone. All we wanted was to find another mum or dad to speak to, someone who understood how we felt. ‘The only people we had to speak to were doctors and nurses and we went through a really lonely time. ‘We had a lot of support from our friends and family - but CLIC Sargent were brilliant and really helped us through a tough time. ‘That’s why we think it is so important to raise money for them and to raise awareness of the condition.’","Hannah Hutchinson had a tumour in her abdomen that depleted her platelet levels so her blood couldn't clot and she was at risk of dangerous bleeding .

'Endangered patients': Janice Harry, pictured last year at a hearing, has been struck off the nursing register . The former chief nurse at the centre of the Mid Staffs scandal has been struck off after it was found she endangered patients. Janice Harry, 60, was head of nursing at Stafford Hospital  during the years of the Mid Staffs scandal, in which 1,200 patients died needlessly. While in charge she made harsh cuts that reduced the number of nurses to dangerous levels. She also refused to adequately staff the A&E department, ignored warnings that patients were at risk and did not provide proper food and fluids for patients on the Emergency Admission Unit. Harry put patients in danger and failed in her role as chief nurse, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) had heard. A panel last year was also told of her aggressive management style, which led her to brand a staff member a 'waste of space' in front of a colleague. She had been let off with a five-year caution last November - even though the NMC ruled that she failed to act as a 'voice for nurses.' Today Harry, who has retired from nursing, agreed that she should be struck off after negotiations with the watchdog. She can now no longer work as a nurse in the UK. Jackie Smith, chief executive of the Nursing and Midwifery Council said: 'We are pleased to confirm a legal agreement has been reached between the NMC, Professional Standards Authority (PSA) and Janice Harry, which will lead to her being struck off the nursing register. 'We had previously raised concerns about the sanction imposed by an independent panel in November 2013, and took immediate steps to refer it to the PSA for review. 'The case raised important issues about the responsibility of nurses who hold senior management positions and their duty to ensure the protection of the public.' During the NMC hearing it emerged Harry asked whether patients were 'going to heaven soon' to see whether beds were likely to become free, shooting down staff with sarcastic retorts if they complained. The misconduct panel had found Harry guilty of exposing patients to 'risk' and 'danger' while she was in charge of nursing at the hospital from 1998 to 2006. She denied the charges against her, but was eventually cautioned for her behaviour. Joanna Harvey, a ward manager, described Harry as 'a bully' who would intimidate staff with aggressive and sarcastic comments. Janice Harry acted in an 'aggressive and intimidating' way and shouted at staff who raised problems with her, reducing some to tears, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard . She said staff tried to avoid meetings her, in which she often brought nurses to tears for making mistakes and missing targets. 'If anyone tried to express their opinion in these meetings, Jan would jump down their throat', she said. 'There were also concerns about patient safety, but Jan wouldn't listen.' Ms Harvey added that standards at the hospital plummeted when cuts of Â£10million were imposed by the Government. She said: 'Patient care had been significantly compromised, and a very stressful atmosphere had been created. Patients were left feeling uncomfortable, unpleasant, and cold - their dignity was not maintained.' A public inquiry led by Sir Robert Francis QC concluded as many as 1,200 patients may have died unnecessarily at the hospital between 2005 and 2008. Harry was employed by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and its predecessor Mid Staffordshire General Hospitals NHS Trust between 1998 and 2006, the NMC was told. She denies the charges against her . William Davis, for the NMC, said Harry presided over an 'unacceptable decline in the standards of nursing care offered' at the hospital. 'She wholly failed to ensure appropriate staffing levels, and the correct skill mix', he said. 'Whilst the registrant was not directly responsible for the provision of care she did have corporate responsibility for determining and monitoring the standards of care provided by nursing staff at the hospital.'She adopted an aggressive management style, which created an unpleasant atmosphere for staff.'Harry, previously a board member with the West Midlands Regional Health Authority and the Wolverhampton NHS Trust, left Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust in the summer of 2006. She retired from professional practice three years later. A total of 55 nurses and midwives from Stafford Hospital have been referred to the NMC over accusations of misconduct since February 2010.","Janice Harry, 60, was head of nursing at the hospital from 1998 to 2006 .

An alleged Philadelphia mob boss has walked free after beating two racketeering trials in a case that the Justice Department began pursuing more than a decade ago. Joseph 'Uncle Joe' Ligambi, 74, quietly left the city's federal courthouse Tuesday morning with his brother and nephew and took the front seat in a waiting black car. He said he planned to 'relax' Tuesday night after spending 2 1/2 years in prison. Justice Department officials decided not to take Ligambi to trial a third time. Clearly excited: Joseph 'Uncle Joe' Ligambi, 74, left the federal courthouse Tuesday and smiled after it became clear that the District Attorney was dropping their case against him . Free: The alleged mobster faced non-violent charges mostly related to localized gambling rings . 'It was a non-violent case. They were not looking to put away blood-thirsty criminals,' defense lawyer Ed Jacobs told The Associated Press. 'These were, at most, economic crimes, if they were crimes.' The indictment, described by one defense attorney as 'mob lite,' detailed relatively small-scale loansharking and gambling operations, such as efforts to control illegal poker machines inside South Philadelphia bars and collect sports bets in the neighborhood. Defendants could be heard on tape complaining that the mob was broke, and that the spread of legal casinos had taken a toll in their enterprise. 'Reasonable people can disagree on whether this was racketeering conspiracy,' Jacobs said. Out in the open: Ligambi already spent two and a half years behind bars for other charges but he was never found guilty of the central racketeering charge . 'Ten of 12 jurors said it was not.' Ligambi . allegedly took over Philadelphia's La Cosa Nostra after the younger, . flashier Joey Merlino went to prison in 1999. Mob observers said he . focused on business, not mayhem, unlike the bloody reigns attributed to . earlier bosses Merlino and the imprisoned Nicky Scarfo. Back in the day: 'Uncle Joe' is seen entering court in 2001 . Federal prosecutors unsealed a sweeping indictment in 2011, charging more than a dozen people in an investigation begun about a decade before. Two juries deadlocked on the central racketeering charge against Ligambi while acquitting him of lesser counts. The second trial ended Friday. A judge on Tuesday dismissed the remaining counts, given the Justice Department's decision. Overall, 11 defendants were convicted in the case, including Ligambi's alleged underboss and enforcer. Reputed underboss Joseph 'Mousie' Massimino was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Italian mob 'is not just a rag-tag bunch of guys hanging on a corner in South Philadelphia,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Frank Labor argued at his sentencing. 'It's a large, well-established, entrenched criminal enterprise' around the world. Yet Jacobs and other questioned the resources devoted to the 14-year FBI investigation. Jurors, . speaking to The Philadelphia Inquirer over the weekend, doubted the . reliability of mob turncoats and debtors who testified for the . government. Ligambi's only . co-defendant at the second trial, his nephew and alleged consigliere . George Borgesi, was acquitted Friday and released. Mind for business: Mob observers said after reportedly taking over La Cosa Nostra crime family, he focused on business, not mayhem, unlike the bloody reigns attributed to earlier bosses . Retired: A judge on Tuesday dismissed the remaining counts against the 74-year-old, given the Justice Department's decision not to try the case for a third time . He had been accused of helping Ligambi from prison, where he's spent the last 14 years in the Merlino case. U.S. Attorney Zane Memeger said Friday that the 11 convictions were an 'excellent result.' 'The government has shown throughout this prosecution that members of the Philadelphia La Cosa Nostra family have engaged in substantial criminal activity that warrants serious punishment,' he said.","Joseph 'Uncle Joe' Ligambi has had the remaining charges against him dropped after a second jury couldn't reach a verdict .

A Catholic priest who juggles his job with property developing has landed a £20million deal - and will donate all the spare profits to church charity projects. Father Gregory Grant, 63, went into business with a parishioner in 1998 and now runs the PG Group from a converted office above his Bristol church. The company has built up a large portfolio by buying dilapidated city centre buildings and turning them into much-needed accommodation. Father Gregory Grant, 63, went into business with a parishioner in 1998 and now runs the PG Group from a converted office above his Bristol church . But now they have moved into the big league by buying a 13-storey office block which they plan to convert into 120 new homes. Father Gregory has always considered God to be the 'third partner' in the business and as such gives a third of the profits to church projects. To date the company has handed out more than £1million to charity and he expects the new deal - his biggest to date - to raise that figure even further. The parish priest of St Patrick’s Church, in Redfield, Bristol, said: 'God gives you money simply so that you can give it away again. New project: Lewins Mead in Bristol which is being developed by Father Gregory Grant . 'My idea of fun is working out the best way to make money so that we can find a way of giving it away. It’s very satisfying. 'The work of the priest is often cyclical, with the same services coming around again each year. 'But the world of property management has projects, which have a beginning, a middle and an end.' After being ordained in 1977, Father Gregory spent four years as curate at Corpus Christi Church, Weston-super-Mare, where he became involved in his first development project. The church had an old Scout hall facing the sea and Father Gregory made £40,000 by selling it for redevelopment and using the money to build a meeting room. Later he was appointed parish priest of St Patrick’s in Bristol, which was scheduled for closure because of its decaying 65-year old church and dwindling 200 congregation. Father Gregory opted to rebuild the church, which now has a new building, convent, 22 retirement homes and a 67-bed nursing home - and its congregation has grown to 600. He officially launched the business in 1998 with parishioner and friend Peter Bradley in a bid to raise a small amount for their local community. Mr Bradley died from a brain tumour a year later aged 43 and his wife Fiona took over his role as trustee. In 2002, Father Gregory launched The Grant Bradley Trust, which helps to fight poverty in the Third World by providing housing and building schools.

A mother wept in court today as she described the moment her two-year-old girl fell to her death from the fourth floor walkway of an apartment block through a hole allegedly left by a workman. As the trial opened of maintenance worker Robert Warner, 45, jurors were told how Ryaheen Banismuslem wandered off from where she had been playing with her five-year-old brother in a communal garden area at the Wicker Riverside apartments in Sheffield city centre. Her mother, Ola Al Fatle, told the court: 'I didn't let her out of my sight usually.  I followed her and she was not there. It was a very short time.' She broke down and sobbed in the witness box for about 30 seconds before still shaking she said: 'I was looking for her but I didn't see. I didn't see anything.' Ryaheen Banimuslem, two, died after falling through a gap in a balcony 'left by workman Robert Warner, 45' The toddler died after falling from the fourth floor balcony of the Wicker Riverside building in Sheffield . 'Then three females said ""She was here"", and pointed. They were looking down and I saw her down.' Speaking . through an interpreter, Mrs Fatle said she had noticed a gap in the . walkway barrier about two weeks before and and put a bench in front of . it. 'It was clear to all people and was seen to all,' she said. The two-and-a-half-year-old girl was rendered unconscious by the fall and died almost immediately, jurors heard. Mrs . Fatle, who said she rarely used the garden and would not have gone . there if she knew the barrier was missing, said she was planning to . leave the flats because of her safety fears. Court: Ryaheen's mother Olaz Fatle, left, and father Hikmak Banimuslem, right. Mrs Fatle said she rarely used the garden and would not have gone in there if she knew the barrier was missing . Sheffield Crown Court was told that the workman removed the glass panel to use elsewhere in the building . 'It was not comfortable to us as a family,' she said. 'We had nowhere to go, myself and my children.' Earlier, Bryan Cox QC, prosecuting, said Ryaheen had been playing in an outdoor garden area on the fourth floor of the block with her brother, mother and others when she strayed along a walkway and fell through a gap left by Warner. The court heard that Warner, who was contracted to carry out maintenance on the apartments, was supposed to replace a panel in the garden area of the flats, which was regularly used by residents for recreational purposes. Ryaheen, whose father came to England from Iraq to study for a PhD, died after falling 60ft from the balcony . The workman, from Shiregreen, Sheffield, denies one count of manslaughter by gross negligence . But instead of purchasing a new glass panel for the job, prosecutors said he took one from the adjacent walkway, and then invoiced Allsopp Residential Investment Management (ARIM), who oversaw the flat’s maintenance, for the panel he never bought. Mr Cox told the seven female and five male jurors at Sheffield Crown Court: 'This accident was caused by the defendant's negligent conduct. 'The prosecution say he removed the barrier from the walkway, he failed to replace it and did nothing to prevent access to the walkway and created a very dangerous state of affairs and did nothing to warn of any obvious danger.' 'The prosecution say [Warner] removed the barrier from the walkway, he failed to replace it, and did nothing to prevent access to the walkway' - prosecutor Bryan Cox, QC . The prosecutor said Warner, who was employed as a caretaker at the block of flats, had had his hours reduced from five days a week to two. He said a fortnight before the tragedy, Warner had telephoned his manager at ARIM to say two glass panels, one on the ground floor and one on the fourth floor, needed replacing. The works order was given on 14 June, and he invoiced the company for £176 for two panels. The prosecution said it was unclear when the walkway panel was removed, but various witnesses had seen panels missing at different times and the garden panel was broken a 'significant' time before 14 June. Warner told police when interviewed that he had checked the flats two days before the girl fell and there were no broken or missing panels. But Mr Cox said the panel was deliberately removed from the walkway, and the only person who had a reason to do so was Warner. Tributes to a young life: Flowers and a class photograph were left at the spot where Ryaheen died . He said: 'He did not intend to injure Ryaheen or cause her death, but the negligence was the cause of her death. It was, say the prosecution, grossly negligent.' The court heard that Warner had more than 20 years' experience working as a builder and maintenance man. He had undertaken courses in health and safety, and his general tasks included maintaining the flats and grounds of the tower block, as well as menial tasks like clearing up rubbish. Warner’s company, RS Enterprises, had been operating for two years and made between £35,000 and £45,000 a year, the court heard. Mr Cox told the jury how Ryaheen was born in Iraq but moved to the UK in 2011 as her father, Hikmat, was studying for a PhD in material physics at Sheffield University. She died almost instantly from her injuries when she fell 60ft on 27 June 2012, the jury was told. Warner, of Shiregreen, Sheffield, denies a single charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. The trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, continues.","Ryaheen Banismuslem, two, fell through gap where a glass panel had been .

Tragic: Emily Harris, 18, who died in a blaze investigators believe was started by clothing which fire after it was left too close to an electric heater . A teenager burned to death while pet-sitting at her grandparents' home when clothing left to close to an electric heater burst into flames, an inquest heard. Emily Harris, 18, was so badly burned by the fire at the house in Aberdare, South Wales, that she could only be identified by her dental records and one of her favourite bracelets. Investigators believe the blaze caught hold after clothing fell on an electric heater. A sudden rush of air caused the smouldering garments to burst into a raging fire, trapping the student in an upstairs bedroom. Just a lock of her hair survived the blaze intact. Miss Harris, who had hoped to become a childcare worker, had offered to stay alone in her grandparents five-bedroom home to look after their pets while they were away on holiday. The inquest was told Miss Harris had spent the night of October 17 last year with friends at pubs in Aberdare and returned to the house alone at midnight. Her friend Gabriella Davies told the hearing: 'We chatted and were having fun - there were no issues. 'Emily was not falling down drunk and was just a bit tipsy. 'A friend drove her home and she made her way to the front door - I believe she was home safe and well.' It was not until seven hours later that neighbours saw flames shooting from the first floor of the modern detached house. Fire crews were on the scene in two minutes but took two hours struggling to bring the blaze under control. The property was so unstable rescuers could not bring Miss Harris’s body out until the following day. The cause of her death was given as smoke inhalation and burns. Destroyed: Investigators believe the blaze caught hold after clothing fell on an electric heater. A sudden rush of air caused the smouldering garments to burst into a raging fire, trapping the student in an upstairs bedroom. Miss Harris's family learned of her death early on the morning of the fire after her sister received a phone call to ask if everyone was okay. Simon Harris, her father, said in a written statement: 'This was the first we knew - we were then informed that Emily had passed away inside the house. 'The police later gave us a lock of Emily’s hair which we will keep forever.' Fire investigator Andrew Sargeant told the hearing: 'The cause of the fire is likely to be one or more of the electric heaters placed too close to clothing, or clothing having fallen on one fo the fires. 'It falls in line with a small smouldering fire burning in the room for some time before more oxygen breaking into the room turned it into a raging fire which has spread through the house.' Write caption here . Emily’s grandparents Keith and Ann Harris, who were on holiday in Tenby, West Wales, returned home after hearing of the tragedy. Aberdare coroner Andrew Barkley said: 'It is highly probably that the fire started in the bedroom where Emily was found, either by an electric fire or halogen heater coming too close to something. 'It is a distinction which hardly matters - all other possibilities have been excluded.' Miss Harris, of Aberdare, South Wales, was training to be a childcare worker and had just passed her driving test. 'She loved to drive and to listen to music, watch films and socialise with her friends,' said her father. Tributes were paid to 'happy and smiling' Miss Harris at Aberdare Girls’ School, which she had only left months earlier. Headteacher Jane Rosser said: 'She was a delightful pupil who always had a smile on her face. 'Emily was kind and caring to all around her - she was a lovely girl.' The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Emily Harris returned home a 'bit tipsy' after a night out last October 17 .

It might not be the proudest achievement on his extensive list of accolades, but Justin Bieber has become the latest edition to the celebrity mugshot hall of fame . The head of Justin Bieber’s record label has revealed his concerns over the teenage pop star’s wild behaviour, claiming the singer needs an ‘intervention’. Lucian Grainge, the chairman of Universal Music Group, admitted that the star needs help following months of wayward behaviour which finally saw the 19-year-old arrested last week in the US. The 53-year-old music mogul said Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun had flown over to Panama to try and help the star while he was on holiday. He said: ‘I’m very concerned about him. I’ve been concerned about him for many months. And Scooter Braun, who I work with very closely and who is supposed to be here but is with him at the moment. ‘This has nothing to do with the business or records or releases. This is to do with the young man. ‘He needs help. He needs an intervention. We are going to give all the support as a company to take as much pressure off him so he can look forward. Hopefully, we will all get through to him. But what people don’t understand is, he’s a 19-year-old. 'You cannot just pick someone up and force them to do something if they are not ready. ‘I think that emotionally, the public or people will see someone’s behaviour and think: “This is what I would do”. ‘All of us around him need to take all the responsibility, all the pressure off him and give him as much support so he can to address the issues he has - and he does have issues.

His manager has said that Bieber needs help, and that he is going to give all the support he can to take the pressure off him . Police said the star had been drag racing a rented yellow Lamborghini at twice the speed limit on a Miami Beach street. He was also charged with resisting arrest and having an expired driving licence. The incident is the latest in a string of problems for the troubled star. In March last year, he came on stage two hours late at a concert, and later screamed at a photographer and had to be restrained by his own minders. That same month, a neighbour near to his Los Angeles home claimed Bieber spat at him and even threatened to kill him. In November, he and a friend spent more than three hours in a Rio de Janeiro brothel and he was photographed creeping out under a bed sheet. He was later charged with vandalism after he was caught spraying graffiti reading ‘Beliebers 4 life’ on a hotel wall. In January, a neighbour accused Bieber and his friends of hurling eggs at his home, an ‘unprovoked attack’.","Record label boss has called for Bieber to have an intervention .

A leaked NHS report has revealed that cancer patients in the UK are being treated with obsolete radiotherapy machines. Out of 269 machines, known as linear accelerators, 38 are more than 10 years old and should be replaced, while a further 139 are at least eight years old. Modern machines, such as a state-of-the-art Gamma Knife machine, give patients better treatment. The NHS is using radiotherapy machines that are 10 years old and should have been replaced, it has been unveiled. File picture . The outdated machines, which use radiation to shrink tumours, also kill healthy tissue surrounding the cancer. Modern machines use a single dose of highly focused radiation, designed . to destroy only the tumour and leave the surrounding healthy tissue . undamaged. The document calls for an urgent review into the machines and states: 'The expected lifespan of a linear accelerator is 10 years. 'Machines older than this are considered outdated and often can no longer deliver modern radiotherapy techniques, which are linked to better patient outcomes.' The document, seen by the Daily Mirror, was blasted by Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt. She said: 'Patients won’t be safe if they keep these old machines working. 'They should be replaced with modern machines fit for the 21st century.' She added that the UK is trailing other European countries in modern radiotherapy treatments. The Gamma Knife is only available in four English cities. Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer is worried about the revelations in the report. He said: 'Radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of bowel cancer. Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt says the UK is severely lagging behind other European nations in radiotherapy care . 'It’s vital that patients have access to the latest advanced radiotherapy techniques which target the cancer and cause less damage to surrounding healthy tissue. 'We’d be concerned about any apparent inequalities in the treatment of bowel cancer as a result of ""outdated"" technology.' Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Radiotherapy is a life saving treatment, contributing to around four in 10 cancer cures. 'We want all patients who need it to have access to advanced radiotherapy techniques such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy that target the tumour more accurately and have fewer side effects. 'Since 2013 the Radiotherapy Innovation Fund has given thousands more patients access to IMRT and the NHS must be in a position to build on this success.' A spokesperson from NHS England said: 'The commissioning of radiotherapy services is the responsibility of NHS England however the running and replacement of linear accelerators is the responsibility of the individual hospitals where the machines are located. 'NHS England is aware of the age of the current national stock of machines and supports the replacement of machines as they reach the end of their operational life. To support hospitals with older machines, the Department of Health has  recently launched a scheme to assist with purchasing of new linear accelerators. 'NHS England and Cancer Research UK will shortly be publishing a document outlining a vision for innovative radiotherapy services. This will be used to inform the production of a 5-year strategy for radiotherapy services. 'This will be supported by two other pieces of work being carried out by NHS England, which are close to completion, looking at the current provision of stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy services and the future anticipated capacity and demand. 'This will allow NHS England to plan services for patients which are clinically effective, accessible and represent a responsible investment of public monies.' Radiotherapy is a treatment that involves the use of high-energy radiation. It is commonly used to treat cancer. Almost half of all people with cancer have radiotherapy as part of their treatment plan. More than 120,000 patients every year benefit from radiotherapy, which cures more people than cancer drugs. Tumour cells are destroyed quickly by X-rays, unlike normal cells. Radiotherapy has to be aimed precisely. Even the slightest movement – such as the patient breathing – increases the risk of errors. It is also sometimes used to treat benign (non-cancerous) tumours and other conditions - such as thyroid disease and some blood disorders.","One in eight machines are a decade old and should have been replaced .

'They had been go-karting and were returning home. 'He had one passenger in his vehicle and accepted he was driving at speed. 'He told the officer he was racing with the vehicle behind.' The court was told that the southbound carriageway of the A19 near Crathorne, North Yorkshire, was busy at the time of the incident, at midday on November 30 last year, and is often used by slower moving agricultural vehicles.

Michael Sisson-Pell, for Richardson, said his client felt 'remorse' but denied racing. He said: 'Prison would be a catastrophe for him, his family, and the employees of his firm who would very likely lose their employment.' Mike Walsh, for Burrows - who also denied racing - said: 'I do beg for mercy for my client. He has been a fool.' Richardson and Burrows were spared an immediate jail term, but were both given a four-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 300 hours of community service. They were also fined £85 each and ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge, as well as being banned from driving for three years.

'We have never seen speeds of 144 miles an hour, especially on a duel carriage way in the middle of a Saturday lunchtime.” He underlined they had been driving at excessive speed, in convoy, and 'showing off'. He continued: 'The issue of racing came up. We have heard submissions on that. There were passengers on both your cars. “The first and presiding risk was to the five people in those cars - the risk of fatality was so that the mere suggestion of a rabbit running out could have distracted the driver and there would have been a catastrophe in North Yorkshire.'

Leaving court, Richardson said: 'The only message I have for other drivers is - don’t do it.' North Yorkshire Police’s mobile safety camera manager, Dave Brown, said: 'The sentence sends a clear message as to how seriously the criminal justice system takes such appalling driving. 'The evidence captured by the safety camera shows both vehicles travelling in close proximity at extremely high speed. Any error, no matter how minor, could have been catastrophic for the two drivers, their passengers and other road users. 'The safety camera operator at the time, was utterly astounded by the speed of the vehicles. Members of the public should be allowed to use the roads in safety and should not be put at risk by other, irresponsible and dangerous drivers.

Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler faced further humiliation today after being referred to as ‘Rottweiler’ on a live news broadcast. The hugely embarrassing blunder took place during a flagship current affairs programme in Gabon, a former French colony on the west coast of Africa. A clip of the show is now spreading online in France, showing a female journalist announcing ‘more sad news’ towards the ends of a news show. Scroll down for video .

Un-muzzed: Valerie Trierweiler, pictured during her charity trip to India yesterday, earned the nickname 'Rottweiler' when she started dating Hollande . She then describes how President Francois Hollande has ended his ‘shared life’ with ‘the journalist Valerie Rottweiler’. Ms Trierweiler was first nicknamed ‘The Rottweiler’, after the potentially hugely aggressive dog, in April 2012. This was the month before Ms Trierweiler’s then boyfriend was elected, when she said: ‘I have character, they can’t muzzle me’. Ms Trierweiler has displayed her own fiery temper on numerous occasions, not least of all when she learned of Mr Hollande’s affair with the actress Julie Gayet almost three weeks ago. All over: President Hollande and Ms Trierweiler officially ended things over the weekend after his affair with a French actress . She is said to have gone on the rampage, smashing up antique furniture before checking herself into a hospital for eight days, suffering from stress. The relationship officially ended last Sunday, but Ms Trierweiler has been allowed to complete one last charity trip to India with presidential staff including a bodyguard. She is now expected to stay away from the Elysee Palace, and will be living alone in the flat she once shared with Mr Hollande in Paris’s 15th arrondissement. Gabon gained independence from France in 1960, but retains extremely close ties with its former coloniser.","Gabonese news anchor referred to Trierweiler as a dog live on air .

Police in the Philippines abused suspected criminals with a 'wheel of torture' game, according to human rights groups. The officers are accused of using the cruel game of chance while interrogating people thought to be drug traffickers. A photograph of the wheel obtained by the Commission on Human Rights shows a variety of punishments occupying different amounts of space on the wheel. 'Wheel of torture': This photograph shows a wheel allegedly used to decide cruel punishments for suspected criminals . Victims claimed they have been beaten up, electrocuted and hit by steel bars and baseball bats in the course of the officers' abuse. One said police pointed a gun at him, while another accused them of . threatening his relatives. One of the sections of the wheel is labelled '20 seconds Manny Pacman' - the nickname of Manny Pacquiao, a famous Filipino boxer. If the wheel landed there, detainees were punched by officers. Other spaces are marked with the words 'zombies' and 'duck walk', though it is unclear what the punishments entail. A police spokesman said that several officers have been suspended while the practice is investigated. But Amnesty international, which brought the existence of the wheel to light, has said the police's 'despicable' and 'abhorrent' actions require the officers to be tried as criminals. The Philippines has a history of torture and rights abuses left over from when it was ruled by brutal dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Thousands of his regime's victims won a law suit against the former leader's estate in 1992. Punching punishment: One section of the wheel is named in honour of Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, right . Current president Benigno Aquino III, son of leaders who fought Marcos, has pledged to prosecute violators of human rights, though campaigners say this has done nothing to stop abuses. The 'wheel of torture' is allegedly stationed at a police building in Binan town, in a province south of the capital Manila. According to the Human Rights Commission, the building is not an official detention centre, and was holding prisoners illegally. A spokesman for the commission said . they investigated the claims investigated after being tipped off several . weeks ago about alleged abuses against more than 40 prisoners. The . comission has urged top police officials to pursue criminal complaints . against about 10 officers who were implicated in the abuses. Accused: Filipino police officers have been suspended while the allegations and investigated . A spokesman for Amnesty International said: 'For police officers to use torture ""for fun"" is despicable.' These are abhorrent acts. Suspending officers is not enough. Errant police personnel and their commanding officers should be held accountable in a court of law.' An anti-torture law in the Philippines was passed in 2009. In 2010, all 11 officers in a Manila police station were relieved of duties after footage emerged of them allegedly hitting a naked robbery suspect. The video showed the suspect screaming on the floor as a man pulled a string bound around his genitals.","Officers 'would spin the wheel to decide which brutal punishment to inflict'

"By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 09:28 EST, 28 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 28 January 2014 . Katie Hopkins has made countless controversial comments in public, especially on parenting . Scroll down for video . Famously happy to share her opinions on parenting with anyone within earshot, former Apprentice loudmouth Katie Hopkins has once again launched an attack on mothers - this time targeting the ones who chose to stay at home with their children over going to work. Airing her views on Twitter yesterday, the self-styled 'social commentator' claimed being a full-time mother was 'merely a biological status', and certainly not a 'job'. The controversial mouthpiece had already hit out at various 'types' of mother in her Yahoo! blog earlier this week. The mother-of-three branded parents who home-school their children as 'certifiable', before venting her spleen on women she labels 'fat mum', advising readers to 'stare opened mouthed at her sheer size wearing only Lycra and a sneer'. But, clearly unfulfilled by her first rant, the 38-year-old decided upon a follow-up, taking to Twitter to mock mothers who chose not to work in favour of bringing up their children at home. She began her tirade with a statement mocking women who blame gender discrimination in the workplace as reasons for not working, saying: 'Misogyny is just a more concise way of saying business is too tough for me.' She followed this an hour later with the tweet: 'Full-time mummy is not an occupation. It is merely a biological status.' Hopkins made her latest controversial statements on her Twitter account, claiming that being a full-time mother is not an occupation . This is not Hopkins' first attack on mothers or on parenting in general, previously causing public outrage with such statements as 'behind every fat child is a fat mum who should take responsibility!', 'school mums are b****** because their lives are boring', 'working mothers who aren't a size eight like me are just lazy', as well as claiming babies with ginger hair are 'harder to love'. She famously aired her strong views on the 'correct' way to parent, during an extremely heated debate with Peaches Geldof on ITV's This Morning, in which she slammed the 'attachment parenting' method Geldof uses with her two sons. It was widely considered that Geldof emerged from the argument victorious. Hopkins gained some support from her Twitter followers for her opinion on stay-at-home mothers, but will likely anger thousands . Her latest statements have garnered a mixed response from her 114,253 twitter followers, who oscillated between berating her for being on Twitter so much, and strong agreement with her statement. Hopkins' most recent tirade was against the housemates of Celebrity Big Brother, upon whom she opened in an unprompted barrage of insults, saying that Linda Nolan was a 'boring old woman' who 'probably smells a little bit of wee', while suggesting former Apprentice star Luisa Zissman would be 'perfectâ€™' in a porn film.","Mother-of-three, 38, also hit out at mothering 'types' on her Yahoo! blog .

Mr. VanKulick died two years ago. 'It stays with you,' she said. 'It's something you never forget.' The cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks. The shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts, but it became known later that at least several of those on board survived the initial explosion. Then-president Ronald Regan ordered a probe into the Challenger catastrophe, where it was found that poor management and a disregard of safety advice were said to have played a role in the accident. It resulted in a nearly three-year lapse in NASA's shuttle program, with the next shuttle, Discovery, taking off on September 29, 1988. NASA ended the shuttle program for good last year, retiring the remaining vessels and instead opting for multimillion-dollar rides on Russian Soyuz capsules to get U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station. Private U.S. companies hope to help fill the gap, beginning with space station cargo and then, hopefully, astronauts. The crew of the space shuttle Challenge from 1986. From left to right: Ellison Onizuka, Mike Smith, Christa McAuliffe, Dick Scobee, Greg Jarvis, Ron McNair and Judy Resnick . Challenger was one of NASA's greatest successes - but also one of its darkest legacies. It was initially built between 1975 and 1978 to be a test vehicle, but was later converted into a fully fledged spacecraft. In its heyday, it completed nine milestone missions - from launching the first female astronaut into space to taking part in the first repair of a satellite by an astronaut. But it was also the vehicle that very nearly ended the space program when a probe into the 1986 disaster found that the shuttle was doomed before it had even taken off. In their honor: The Challenger Memorial Plaque (left) at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, in memory of the seven crew members who died in the 1986 disaster . Roger Boisjoly, a NASA contractor at rocket-builder Morton Thiokol Inc, warned in 1985 that seals on the booster rocket joints could fail in freezing temperatures. 'The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order â€” loss of human life,' he wrote in a memo. On the eve of the ill-fated flight, Boisjoly and several colleagues reiterated their concerns and argued against launching because of predicted cold weather at the Kennedy Space Center. But they were overruled by Morton Thiokol managers, who gave NASA the green light. After the accident, Boisjoly testified to a presidential commission investigating the Challenger accident. The group determined that hot gases leaked through a joint in one of the booster rockets shortly after blastoff that ended with the explosion of the shuttle's hydrogen fuel. Boisjoly died in 2012 aged 73.","Frances and Michael VanKulick lived in Melbourne, not at all far from Kennedy Space Center .

When you play for a team chasing their . first title since 2004  — and have served a ban for five bookings so . receive a longer suspension for a dismissal — it is also rank stupidity. Sadly, it also means Southampton's outstanding performance is of secondary importance. Instead it felt as though Arsenal’s season could be shaped by Flamini’s dismissal. The advantage has swung the way of their title rivals and Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City will go top if they beat Tottenham on Wednesday evening. Chelsea are also waiting in the wings. Southampton played this game at full throttle, taking the lead when Jose Fonte converted Luke Shaw's teasing left wing cross. To Arsenal's credit they recovered from a dreadful first half to level through Olivier Giroud and then went ahead with a delicious strike from Santi Cazorla. To see Arsenal panic as they did in the first half and for much of the second, when they were unable to put their foot on the ball, was extraordinary. Mauricio Pochettino’s team were full of exuberance, feeding off the raw, rampant enthusiasm of Sam Gallagher in his first Premier League start. At the age of just 18 he has the makings of a proper player, making life hell for Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. The kid didn’t give them any rest. Equaliser: Lallana score Southampton's second goal against Arsenal . Vital strike: Cazorla scored Arsenal's second against Southampton . I will take that: Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny wins the ball off Southampton's Jay Rodriguez .

February 2: Crystal Palace - League (h) February 8: Liverpool - League (a) February 12: Manchester United - League (h) February 15: Liverpool - FA Cup (h) To play as he did, against a team with the best defensive record in the Premier League, was something special. Gallagher, pinched from Plymouth’s youth team two years ago, played because Rickie Lambert’s hamstring injury ruled him out. He inspired Southampton’s opening charge, linking brilliantly with Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and the lung-busting runs of Calum Chambers down the right. Wenger’s team were untidy, sluggish and sloppy; careless in possession as Southampton built up a head of steam. Gallagher’s early strike drew a save from Wojciech Szczesny, flying to his right to tip the ball away for a corner. Game on. Southampton took the lead in the 21st minute. Shaw put in the hard yards, buying some time and space down the left and his cross was met by the head of Fonte at the far post. They could have been two up when Gallagher’s effort inside the six-yard box hit a post. Opening strike: Southampton's Jose Fonte, left, scores the first goal of the match against Arsenal at St Mary's . As half-time approached Wenger was desperate to get his team back down that tunnel and at the break he tweaked his system, encouraging his side to be more adventurous whenever they were in possession. It worked. Within minutes of the restart they were level when Bacary Sagna, in an advanced position for the first time in the game, poked the ball into Giroud’s path. The Arsenal forward improvised, turning Sagna’s ball beyond Artur Boruc for the equaliser. It was a special strike. Southampton were stunned, conceding again . when Cazorla’s sweetly struck effort on the edge of the area beat the . Polish goalkeeper. It was a remarkable turnaround for Arsenal, but .

In a bid to fight back against increasingly sophisticated hunters, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is using the chips along with the DNA records to track the decreasing rhino population and their valuable horns. The technology, gifted by charity World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is designed to protect the remaining 1,000 rhinos in the country as well as to collect evidence to use against poachers in court. Experts have warned that if the current trend continues, more than 1,000 rhinos could be poached by 2014 and Kenya alone saw 23 of its rhinos killed last year. Spokesman Paul Muya of the Kenya Wildlife Service, said that rangers will be able to move to areas where the lion have encroached using coordinates sent by the collars . Then they will be able to return the animals safely to the park, he said . The number of rhinos being poached in Kenya has risen dramatically in recent years and the reason is their valuable horns, that can sell for Â£40,150 per kilogram, which is more valuable than gold. While trading of the horns was regulated in the 1990s and poaching figures fell sharply as a result, there is increasing demand for the horns in South East Asia after a Vietnamese politician claimed the ingredient, used in traditional medicine, cured his cancer. The collars enable  the rangers to quickly move to the areas where the lions have encroached and return the animals to the park .","Livestock farmers track and kill lions to avenge the loss of animals .

With just two months to go before the birth of her seventh child, Kathy, 38, from Mount Hagen in Papua New Guinea, was looking forward to welcoming her new baby into the world. But tragically, the moment would never arrive. Instead, after a harrowing two day ordeal which saw her repeatedly beaten and raped with an iron bar, Kathy's baby was dead. Why? Because her family and neighbours believed - wrongly - that she was a witch. Endemic: A woman suspected of being a witch is burned alive after being gang raped in Mount Hagen . Kathy's Mount Hagen homeland is the capital of Papua New Guinea's Eastern Highlands, a place notorious for tribal violence, a ruthlessly applied system of 'payback' and dangerously high levels of drink and drugs. It is also one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman, with a shocking 99 per cent of women thought to have suffered violence of some sort at some point in their lives. Women are, according to locals, worth less than pigs, while many more fall victim to the same sort of superstitious belief as Kathy. In Mount Hagen, women suspected of being witches can be stoned, burned alive or even burned at the stake. Kathy was at a family funeral when the phone call that would change her life forever was patched through. Upsetting: Kathy's story is all too common in Papua New Guinea where violence against women is endemic . Prisoners: Ross Kemp talks to some of the men incarcerated in Port Moresby. Many of the men are rapists . Damascus, Syria . The war-torn Syrian capital was deemed the world's worst place to live by the Economist's Intelligence Unit. Dhaka, Bangladesh .

'There was a phone call and the person on . the phone said: ""This dead person, whose funeral you've just had, she's . the one who ate his heart"",' she remembers. 'That's why they took me and tied my hands . up with barbed wire.' At the time, she was seven months pregnant but even that wasn't enough to save her from what followed. 'I was . strapped up with barbed wire,' she recalls. 'Then they dragged me to the house and . locked me inside. 'They took my blouse, put a bush knife through my . blouse, my skirt and my tights, took them off and threw them aside. One . of them pulled my leg, one of them pulled the other and one man pushed . my head back, and I stayed like that. I didn't do anything and I didn't . move.' Already bleeding from the cruel barbed wire and in terror for her life, Kathy hoped that by doing nothing, the men might be persuaded to leave her alone. But worse was to come. 'One of them split some firewood and made a fire outside,' she says. 'They . heated up iron rods, spades and bush knives and when they were really . hot, they came in and put them on my skin. 'They damaged all my skin. They pushed an iron into my vagina. They tortured me for two days,' she continues. 'Five times . they pushed the rod into my vagina. The things they did to me... They . destroyed me. My vagina is still very sore. They shoved iron rods inside . me. It's totally destroyed my rectum and my vagina.' And Kathy's story is by no means unique, as Ross Kemp, points out in the newest series of Extreme World. Papua New Guinea is home to endemic violence, fuelled by the tribal 'payback' system and made worse by illegal moonshine, drugs and poverty. It's capital, Port Moresby, was recently declared one of the worst cities to live in on the planet by the Economist Intelligence Unit, with only Syria's war-torn capital Damascus and Bangladeshi capital Dhaka deemed worse. One of the woman to brave the city is Esther Igo of Women Arise Papua New Guinea, who in an interview with Kemp, declared that violence has gone 'beyond epidemic levels.' 'Every day there is a death, there is a rape, there is a killing, there is a murder, there is some sort of violence,' she explained. 'It's like the whole system, the social structure is breaking down. It's broken. It's all broken.' History: Papua New Guinea gained independence from Australia in the 1970s and is part of the Commonwealth . Tribes: The country has more than hundreds of different groups while 800 different languages are spoken . For many, Kathy among them, the damage is already beyond repair.

Another state now has a bill to consider about bringing firing squads back as an option for prisoners on death row. Lawmakers in Missouri are the latest to debate the issue as they try to come up with a solution in response to the dwindling supplies of lethal injection drugs. The squads are not the only relics from a more gruesome past that are under consideration, as electrocutions and gas chambers have also been suggested. Most states abandoned those execution methods more than a generation ago in a bid to make capital punishment more palatable to the public and to a judicial system worried about inflicting cruel and unusual punishments that violate the Constitution. Modern day firing squad: This is the execution chamber at Utah State Prison where a firing squad lines up and kills the seated prisoner . But to some elected officials, the drug shortages and recent legal challenges are beginning to make lethal injection seem too vulnerable to complications. 'This isn't an attempt to time-warp back into the 1850s or the wild, wild West or anything like that,' said Missouri state Rep. Rick Brattin, who this month proposed making firing squads an option for executions. 'It's just that I foresee a problem, and I'm trying to come up with a solution that will be the most humane yet most economical for our state.' Brattin, a Republican, said questions about the injection drugs are sure to end up in court, delaying executions and forcing states to examine alternatives. It's not fair, he said, for relatives of murder victims to wait years, even decades, to see justice served while lawmakers and judges debate execution methods. Missouri's attorney general and a state lawmaker have raised the notion of rebuilding the state's gas chamber. Earlier this month, a Wyoming lawmaker offered a bill allowing the firing squad. What remains: Four of the bullet holes from the killing of Ronnie Lee Gardner on June 18, 2010 are seen in the wood of the Utah  state prison's firing squad contraption . And a Virginia lawmaker wants to make electrocution an option if lethal-injection drugs aren't available. If adopted, those measures could return states to the more harrowing imagery of previous decades, when inmates were hanged, electrocuted or shot to death by marksmen. States began moving to lethal injection in the 1980s in the belief that powerful sedatives and heart-stopping drugs would replace the violent spectacles with a more clinical affair while limiting, if not eliminating, an inmate's pain. 'This isn't an attempt to time-warp back into the 1850s or the wild, wild West or anything like that,' said Missouri state Rep. Rick Brattin . The total number of U.S. executions has declined in recent years â€” from a peak of 98 in 1999 to 39 last year. Some states have turned away from the death penalty entirely. Many have cases tied up in court. And those that carry on with executions find them increasingly difficult to conduct because of the scarcity of drugs and doubts about how well they work. In recent years, European drug makers have stopped selling the lethal chemicals to prisons because they do not want their products used to kill. At least two recent executions are also raising concerns about the drugs' effectiveness. Last week, Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire took 26 minutes to die by injection, gasping repeatedly as he lay on a gurney with his mouth opening and closing. And on Jan.uary 9, Oklahoma inmate Michael Lee Wilson's final words were, 'I feel my whole body burning.' Missouri threw out its three-drug lethal injection procedure after it could no longer obtain the drugs. State officials altered the method in 2012 to use propofol, which was found in the system of pop star Michael Jackson after he died of an overdose in 2009. The anti-death penalty European Union threatened to impose export limits on propofol if it were used in an execution, jeopardizing the supply of a common anesthetic needed by hospitals across the nation. In October, Governor Jay Nixon stayed the execution of serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin and ordered the Missouri Department of Corrections to find a new drug. Days later, the state announced it had switched to a form of pentobarbital made by a compounding pharmacy. Like other states, Missouri has refused to divulge where the drug comes from or who makes it. Running into problems: A number of states have had problems securing the chemicals used in lethal injections so Burns said that he thought firing squads- like those used in Utah- were the next most humane option . Missouri has carried out two executions using pentobarbital â€” Franklin in November and Allen Nicklasson in December. Neither inmate showed outward signs of suffering, but the secrecy of the process resulted in a lawsuit and a legislative inquiry. Michael Campbell, assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said some lawmakers simply don't believe convicted murderers deserve any mercy. 'Many of these politicians are trying to tap into a more populist theme that those who do terrible things deserve to have terrible things happen to them,' Campbell said. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C., cautioned that there could be a backlash. Reverting back: Bruce Burns, a Republican state senator in Wyoming, said that if the chemicals used in lethal injections are not available, the state should use firing squads . 'These ideas would jeopardize the death penalty because, I think, the public reaction would be revulsion, at least from many quarters,' Dieter said. Some states already provide alternatives to lethal injection. Condemned prisoners may choose the electric chair in eight states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. An inmate named Robert Gleason Jr. was the most recent to die by electrocution, in Virginia in January 2013. Arizona, Missouri and Wyoming allow for gas-chamber executions. Missouri no longer has a gas chamber, but Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat, and Missouri state Sen. Kurt Schaefer, a Republican, last year suggested possibility rebuilding one. So far, there is no bill to do so. Delaware, New Hampshire and Washington state still allow inmates to choose hanging. The last hanging in the U.S. was Billy Bailey in Delaware in 1996. Two prisoners in Washington state have chosen to be hanged since the 1990s â€” Westley Allan Dodd in 1993 and Charles Rodman Campbell in 1994. Firing squads typically consisting of five sharpshooters with rifles, one of which is loaded with a blank so the shooters do not know for sure who fired the fatal bullet. They have been used mostly for military executions. Since the end of the Civil War, there have been three civilian firing squad executions in the U.S., all in Utah. Gary Gilmore uttered his famous final words, 'Let's do it' on Jan. 18, 1977, before his execution, which ended what amounted to a 17-year national moratorium on the death penalty. Convicted killers John Albert Taylor in 1996 and Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010 were also put to death by firing squad. Utah is phasing out its use, but the firing squad remains an option there for inmates sentenced prior to May 3, 2004. Oklahoma maintains the firing squad as an option, but only if lethal injection and electrocution are deemed unconstitutional. In Wyoming, Republican state senator Bruce Burns said death by firing squad would be far less expensive than building a gas chamber. Wyoming has only one inmate on death row, 68-year-old convicted killer Dale Wayne Eaton. The state has not executed anyone in 22 years. Jackson Miller, a Republican in the Virginia House of Delegates, is sponsoring a bill that would allow for electrocution if lethal injection drugs are not available. Miller said he would prefer that the state have easy access to the drugs needed for lethal injections. 'But I also believe that the process of the justice system needs to be fulfilled.'","Missouri state representative Rick Brattin has proposed the move to allow firing squads .

America has deployed the first of six state-of-the-art submarine-hunting jets to the East China Sea as tensions between Japan and China over a group of disputed islands mounts. China last month established an air defense zone covering islands controlled by Japan and claimed by Beijing - sparking fears that it could lead to . an unplanned military incident. Now the U.S. Navy is sending P-8 . Poseidon patrol aircraft which will strengthen America's ability to hunt . submarines and other vessels in seas close to China. Tensions: U.S. Navy FA-18 Hornets cram the flight deck of the USS George Washington during a joint military exercise with Japan, last week, in the Pacific Ocean as the territorial row over the disputed islands intensified. (File phot0) Tensions in the volatile region have risen since the Chinese Air Force stated that it ‘escorted’ foreign . warplanes out of its newly-declared air defence identification zone . (ADIZ). The deployment, planned before China established the ADIZ, includes six aircraft to be delivered to Kadena air base on Okinawa this month. The . first arrived on Sunday, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy told Reuters. The mission in the waters west of Japan's main islands will be the new . aircraft's first anywhere. Flashpoint: Chinese and Japanese air defense and economic zones and locating the islands in the East China Sea that the two countries have been disputing . Dispute: Relations between Japan and China have become strained as both assert their claims to disputed islets known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea. (File photo) The jet, built by Boeing Co based on its 737 passenger plane, has been built to replace the aging propeller-powered Lockheed Martin P-3 Orion patrol aircraft, which has been in service for 50 years. Packed with the latest radar equipment and armed with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, the P-8 is able to fly further and stay out on mission longer than the P-3. The arrival of the P-8 came a day before U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is due to arrive in Tokyo, a visit that is being overshadowed by the territorial spat in the East China Sea between Japan and China. While taking no position on the sovereignty of the islands known to the Japanese as the Senkakus and to the Chinese as the Daioyu, it does recognize Japanese control and therefore part of territory it would defend under a security pact with Japan. Stand-off: China last week scrambled fighter jets to monitor two unarmed U.S. bombers that flew over the East China Sea in defiance of Beijing's declaration it was exercising greater military control over the area. (File photo) Tensions in the region became even more strained last week when China sent two fighter jets to investigate US and Japanese military planes’ entry into a disputed area of the East China Sea. Beijing has declared that all aircraft crossing through airspace must file flight plans and identify themselves or face unspecified ‘defensive emergency measures’. But the US, Japan and South Korea have all defied the ruling over the past few days. In an intensification of the spat, China launched fighter jets into the area at the same time as foreign military flights. Chinese Air Force spokesman Colonel Shen Jinke said warplanes had been scrambled to monitor two US surveillance aircraft and ten Japanese planes, including an F-15 fighter jet, crossing through the ADIZ. He was reported by state media as saying that the jets had tracked and identified the planes. Ministers in Tokyo declined to give details of the flights but said the Japanese Air Force was on routine operations and had encountered no ‘abnormal’ incidents. China announced the creation of the zone. It covers a vast area of the East China Sea, including a region where gas has been discovered. The row centres on airspace over three uninhabited outcrops called the Senkaku Islands by Japan and Diaoyu by China. Taiwan also has a claim to the islands – bought by Japan from private sellers in 2012, much to the anger of China – and South Korea maintains an interest in a submerged rock in the zone known as Ieodo. The US called the establishment of the ADIZ a ‘destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region’.","China claims sovereignty over Japanese controlled islands .

And more than half (57 per cent) believe that expert mentoring would better equip them with the skills to reach their potential. Over a third of women say lack of confidence in their own abilities and reluctance to push for promotions is making it harder for them to reach their career goals . The survey of 2,000 women was carried out to launch Cancer Research UK's pioneering Women of Influence initiative. The scheme has established a unique network of senior businesswomen to support the charity's exceptional young female scientists and clinicians as they move up the career ladder to progress into senior positions. A quarter feel employers and colleagues have a negative attitude towards balancing work and family . It aims to enable these talented women to reach their potential in becoming science leaders of the future, and raise Â£1 million to support their life-saving research to help beat cancer sooner. 'Confidence helps us reach higher in our careers,' said Tamara Box, Chairwoman of the Cancer Research UK Women of Influence board. She continued: 'Cancer Research UK currently has many well-educated and capable female scientists who should be rising to the top of their professions. 'Our Women of Influence initiative hopes to provide business mentoring as well as financial support, in order that their work may be continued even while they have full, multifaceted lives. 'They in turn will become role models and leaders for the next generation. I'm confident that Cancer Research UKâ€™s Women of Influence initiative will make a huge difference not only in the lives of the researchers but also in the fight against cancer.' David Scott, Cancer Research UKâ€™s director of science funding said: 'The research we fund will save lives in the future so we need to fund the most talented male and female scientists at all career stages. 'We see a lack of female researchers moving to the highest levels and we want to address this by supporting our female scientists to achieve their potential, becoming future role models for younger scientists and ultimately helping us to beat cancer sooner.'","One in five believe gender discrimination makes it difficult to reach goals .

It has now been revealed that Miami Dolphins' Richie Incognito last year faced allegations of molesting a woman at a charity golf tournament and dumping water on her head. The maligned lineman was accused of molesting a female volunteer with a golf club during a team-sponsored charity golf tournament last year, according to reports. The harassment allegation became public after WPLG obtained a copy of the police report filed May 18, 2012 by the 34-year-old woman. Road trip: Richie Incognito has long been labeled one of the NFL's dirtiest players with a reputation for out-of-bounds behavior off the field . Mr Incognito’s lewd behaviour occurred during the annual Fins Weekend Golf Tournament at the Turnberry Resort and Club, the incident report said. The woman accused the footballer of using a golf club to rub her privates and knock her glasses off her head, a copy of the report reviewed by MailOnline alleges. The woman said Mr Incognito had been drinking during the event. ‘After that, he proceeded to lean up against her buttocks with his private parts as if dancing, saying ‘Let it rain, Let it Rain!’ The report said. ‘He finally finished his inappropriate behavior by emptying bottled water in her face,’ said the report.The woman told cops arriving on the scene that several people saw the inappropriate behaviour and did nothing to stop it. More than frenemies: Richie Incognito (center left), seen on the bench with Jonathan Martin (center right) who claims he was the subject of daily harassment . Had Mr Incognito simply apologized, it does not appear she would have filed the report. Instead, ‘she felt like he didn't care and thought the whole incident was in fun and games,’ the report reads. ‘Other people apologized for him, but not him.’ Dolphins team security said they would handle the issue when it was brought to their attention, but the woman told authorities nothing was done. The woman is not allowed to speak publicly about the incident after signing a confidentiality agreement, according to WPLG. The golf outing accusation is the third in a series of shocking stories involving the previously under-the-radar football player. Last month, a series of voicemails left for teammate Jonathan Martin emerged that showed Mr Incognito using racial slurs and threatening physical violence against him. Mr Incognito was suspended indefinitely from the team while an investigation is carried out. Mr Martin has since left the team to seek counseling, and accused unspecified teammates of threatening to rape his sister. Martin says he was harassed daily, and Incognito acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap Martin's mother . In the time since his suspension, Mr Incognito has told those close to him that he feels betrayed by Mr Martin, a rookie that other Dolphins have publicly said the veteran took under his wing. A source told ESPN the allegations 'shocked' Mr Incognito, and that he feels betrayed. 'It's probably a combination of totally blindsided and a bit betrayed,' the source told the network. 'He's shocked. He can't believe this happened and thinks it probably could have been avoided.' To his credit, several teammates have spoken out in favor of Mr Incognito, and also said many of the comments were taken out of context. 'I don't think what happened is necessary,' teammate Tyson Clabo told ESPN. 'I don't know why he's doing this. And the only person who knows why is Jonathan Martin.' Just this past week, a video emerged of an out-of-control, drunk, shirtless Mr Incognito rampaging through a bar shouting the n-word as terrified patrons dove for cover. The team has not publicly commented on the two latest incidents.","A 34-year-old woman accused Richie Incognito of molesting her with a golf club last year during a team-sponsored charity golf tournament .

The Colorado high school gunman scrawled messages on his forearm indicating five areas of the campus he intended to attack, before adding in Latin: 'The die has been cast.' The chilling messages were found written on Karl Pierson's arm in permanent marker after he headed to Arapahoe High School on Friday, shot a fellow student in the head and took his own life. Authorities today revealed that the letters and numbers on the 18-year-old's arm referred to specific classrooms located near the school's library, . where he Pierson reportedly planned to target librarian and . debate coach Tracy Murphy. The notes added: 'Alea iacta est' - Latin for 'The die has been cast.' The phrase, said by Julius Caesar before leading his army into Italy, means that a situation has passed a point of no return. Gunman: Karl Pierson, 18, scrawled 5 locations at Arapahoe High School on his arm before heading there on Friday morning, allegedly to target the school librarian. He shot one student and took his own life . 'The letters/numbers written on the shooter's arm is an indicator to investigators of the shooter's plan,' Sheriff Grayson Robinson wrote in a news release on Tuesday, the Denver Post reported. He added investigators hope to determine the relevance of the room list 'while closely evaluating if the occupants of those classrooms may have also been targeted for harm by the shooter'. The new information came as staff members prepared to return to the school to gather their belongings on Wednesday ahead of the holiday break. Students will be allowed to do the same on Thursday, but classes will not resume until the new year. Pierson's victim, 17-year-old Claire Davis remains in a coma in critical but stable condition after being shot in the head by the pump-action shotgun Pierson had legally purchased a week earlier. Intentions: He had also written 'The die has been cast' in Latin on his arm - a phrase used by Julius Caesar which means that a situation has passed a point of no return . Police have said that the teenager was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Candlelit vigils have been held outside the school, where a large sign reads: 'Pray 4 Claire'. Her parents released a statement on Facebook saying their daughter remains in a coma.

Admissions: Jurors heard that Lewis Dale, pictured, has admitted that he stabbed his grandmother to death . A teenager has admitted stabbing his grandmother to death while high on mephedrone - then stealing her TV to swap for his next fix, a court heard. Lewis Dale, 17, also repeatedly stabbed his grandfather as he and his wife lay sleeping in their bedroom. Jurors were told that the horrific 2am attack left Irene Dale, 78, dead at the scene. The jury at Hull Crown Court heard that Mrs Dale shouted 'What are you doing?' to her grandson as he pierced her heart and lungs through their duvet with a kitchen knife. Dale, who had cut the phone lines, then left the house in a taxi, carrying a suitcase containing a bundle of designer clothes and his grandparents' HDTV, according to prosecutors. He later swapped the television for five grams of party drug mephedrone - also known as 'meow meow'. He was arrested by armed police later that day, at which point he only had two grams of the drug left. Dale denies murdering his grandmother and attempting to murder his grandfather. Adrian . Strong, prosecuting, told the jury that the facts of the killing were largely admitted, and that they would have to decide whether or not . Dale had the intention to kill. The court heard that Dale had been taken in by his grandparents, who let him stay at their home in the weeks leading up to the incident. On the day of the stabbing, Dale had disappeared for three hours to visit his drug dealer, from whom he bought £50 of mephedrone. Mr Strong told jurors: 'The defence will claim at the time of the attacks he was the subject of a drug-induced psychosis as a result of him taking mephedrone. 'They will say it is a partial defence to murder. Mephedrone or M-Cat is a relatively new drug which was known as meow meow - a legal high until a few years ago. It is now banned. Stabbed: Irene Dale, left, died of her wounds in the bed where she was attacked. Allan Dale, right, was also attacked several times as his grandson made his escape, jurors heard . 'The prosecution case is Lewis Dale was not suffering from a drug-induced psychosis and was showing the effects of taking this drug.' Jurors heard how Dale walked into his grandparents' bedroom, wearing a dressing gown with the hood pulled up, at around 2am. Mr Dale Snr awoke to see his grandson armed with a kitchen knife. 'He was aware of a presence in the room,' said Mr Strong. 'Before he could do anything, Allan Dale described how Lewis lunged at him and plunged a knife into his chest. 'As his grandparents lay in bed he repeatedly plunged the kitchen knife into Allan Dale’s upper body, Irene Dale awoke and shouted: ""Lewis , what are you doing?"" 'Lewis Dale broke off the attack on his grandfather and went around to his grandmother’s side of the bed where he repeatedly stabbed Irene Dale to the chest through the duvet that she had over her. Accused: Dale, left and right, denies murder and attempted murder. Jurors heard they will have to decide whether he was capable of intending to kill at the time of the attack . 'Allan Dale got out of bed, Lewis then stopped the attack on Irene, threw the knife at his grandfather, left the room and went downstairs. Mr Strong told the jury the weapon Dale used to kill his grandmother was the heaviest one in their kitchen block. He said: 'If you take the heaviest instrument and aim it at the chest and abdomen you can sure it was an attempt to murder.' The prosecution also argued that Dale's actions prove he was capable of rational thought, and planning to kill. Mr Strong said: 'Around the time he was in his grandparents room he was texting his dealer. He was able to take part in a relatively-complicated plan and this is not an illustration of a drug-induced psychosis.' Scene: The house in Hull where Irene Dale was stabbed to death . 'There is no real difference between the drugs transaction at 1.30pm and the one at 3.30am. There is the same element of planning. He had the wherewithal to buy the drugs, made the planning and executions. 'The Crown says if he had a psychotic episode it would have lasted some time. Not one of the people who examined him at the police station recognised psychotic behaviour. 'Lewis Dale was only concerned with himself, when he arrived at the police station. He asked what had been done with his suitcase of designer clothes. He asked what was going to happen to him. 'There was nothing about what he had done to his grandfather. This is someone who is so selfishly motivated to get a drug who steals a TV. 'This was a man thinking about how he was going to satisfy his own needs. Drugs are important in this case, but drugs are more about his motivation for the crime rather than an excuse.' The trial continues.","Lewis Dale, 17, admits killing Irene Dale, 78, Hull Crown Court jury hears .

'Terrible': Presenter Clare Balding has spoken about her grandmother's reaction to her being a lesbian and her cancer diagnosis . Clare Balding has revealed that her grandmother branded her ‘disgusting’ for being a lesbian. The 42-year-old broadcaster said her grandmother made the  remark after a newspaper reported that she and former newsreader Alice Arnold, 50, were a couple. She told Desert Island Discs: ‘I said, “Have you seen the paper?” and she said, “Yes, and I think it’s disgusting.” ‘I said, “What, the invasion of my privacy or my lifestyle choice?” and she said both. ‘I didn’t talk to her for about six months after that and that was pretty difficult.’ Miss Balding, who fronts Channel 4’s racing coverage, said she and her grandmother eventually made peace thanks to her dog, Archie, who ‘broke the ice’. Miss Balding also admitted she struggled to cope when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, adding she 'pretended it wasn't happening'. The sports presenter - who first noticed a lump on her throat while watching herself on TV - said she was 'hopeless' following the diagnosis in 2009. Speaking candidly on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, she said: 'I was terrible. 'I couldn’t take it in. I was pretty hopeless. I pretended it wasn’t happening.' The presenter, 42, became emotional when she recalled breaking the news to her partner - radio presenter Alice Arnold. She said: 'We sat and cried. Alice kept saying to me, ""What did the doctors say?"" and I couldn’t remember, so she ended up coming to every consultation with me.' Ms Balding first noticed a lump on her throat while watching herself on TV in Christmas 2008. The star was diagnosed in June 2009, announcing she was in remission just a few months later in August. She had the lump drained by a doctor - but when she returned for a check-up was told she needed a further operation. The presenter returned to work soon after surgery, covering the Spring Meeting at Epsom for the BBC at the end of April. Happy couple: Ms Balding, pictured with her partner Alice Arnold before she received her OBE, spoke about being 'outed' in 2003 and her family's reaction to her relationship . She had a second operation to remove the . remaining cells before undergoing radioactive iodine treatment. She . announced she had been given the all-clear in early 2011. When asked by Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young how her health was now, she replied 'fantastic'. The . interview comes as was revealed that the presenter refused to host . coverage this year’s Open golf championship at Muirfield because of the . Scottish club’s ban on women becoming members. In the programme, the presenter spoke about being 'outed' in 2003 after she attended a film premier with her partner Alice, 51. She said: 'My . parents knew but my grandmother didn’t. I said, ""Grandma, I . need to talk to you"", and she said, ""yes, I should think you do"". 'I . said, ""Have you seen the papers?"" and she said, ""Yes and I think it is . disgusting"". [I asked] ""What, the invasion of my privacy or my lifestyle . choice?"" and she said, ""Both"". 'I didn’t talk to her for about six months after that and that was pretty difficult. But we’re fine now.' The couple have been together for 11 years - and had a civil partnership in 2006. Ms Balding's treatment coincided an interview with Grand National winner Liam Treadwell where she told the jockey he could now afford some new teeth - now coined 'toothgate'. The jockey had a condition called hypodontia - meaning some of his teeth were missing. 'National treasure': Despite some ups and downs throughout her career, Ms Balding was widely praised for her involvement in the Olympic and Paralympic coverage last year . Ms Balding said the combination of both the controversy and her illness 'wasn't great'. She added: 'You . have to say ""What can I do to make sure I don’t do that again?"". But . because I was going into hospital straight afterwards I gave Alice my . phone which never stopped and she was not able to say to them, ""Will you . just leave her alone she’s just being wheeled down to the anaesthetic"". 'I didn’t want anyone to know I was ill. I didn’t want to use that as an excuse. She admitted she regretted the incident - saying 'I think I was just trying to be one of the boys. [It was] not very clever.' However, the presenter has now put her illness and the controversy behind her - and has been widely praised for her work on the Olympic and Paralympics last year. Ms Balding's choice of music on the 45-minute show included the theme to The New Adventures of Black Beauty television series. Other tracks included Beautiful Noise by . Neil Diamond, a favourite of her mothers, and She’s Got A Way by Billy Joel  - a song played at her civil partnership ceremony.

Ryan O'Neal snatched an Andy Warhol portrait of his ex-lover Farrah Fawcett from her home shortly after she died, even though he knew it was not his, it was claimed this week. But as a long-awaited trial opened in Los Angeles, a lawyer for the veteran actor claimed he was the rightful owner of the painting, with an estimated value of up to $12 million (£7million). Lawyers for the University of Texas at Austin told the panel . of six women and six men that Fawcett repeatedly described herself as . the portrait's owner before her death in 2009, and her dying wishes . included that all her artwork be given to the school. Claims: Ryan O'Neal snatched an Andy Warhol portrait of his ex-lover Farrah Fawcett from her home shortly after she died, even though he knew it was not his, it was claimed this week . Dispute: Warhol created his two silkscreen portraits of the actress in 1980 . The university says Fawcett had insisted the Warhol painting should be displayed in a museum next to a near-identical portrait of the late actress. The university's lawyer, David Beck, told the jury that O'Neal removed the work from Fawcett's Wilshire Boulevard condominium shortly after she died of cancer on June 25, 2009, aged 62. 'We need your help to resolve a dispute as to who really owns this Warhol painting,' he said in his opening statement in the LA Superior Court. Relationship: O'Neal was Miss Fawcett's on-off lover for 30 years and they had a son Redmond . Fawcett 'had possession and control of these two paintings on the day she died and for years before that,' the university's lawyer said, claiming O'Neal knew that when he drove away with the disputed canvas. 'He didn't tell anyone what he was going to do, and he didn't tell anyone what he had done,' Beck said. Outrage: Controversy also shrouded O'Neal, when he donated Farrah's infamous red swimsuit, seen here,  to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. Beck showed jurors Fawcett's living trust and told the panel that the actress chose not to leave anything to O'Neal. There's evidence that Fawcett described both of the portraits as her own, Beck said. 'We are now told, since Farrah is now dead and can't speak for herself, and Andy Warhol is dead and can't speak for himself, Mr. O'Neal says that portrait was never Farrah's to begin with,' Beck said. But O'Neal's lawyer Martin Singer  said that the . university is relying on witnesses who had animosity toward the . Oscar-nominated actor and evidence would show the disputed artwork was a . gift to O'Neal from Warhol. He said the university was trying to . take away the one portrait the 72-year-old actor has of 'the love of his . life, Farrah Fawcett.' 'One . iconic portrait of Farrah Fawcett is not enough,' he told jury, . referring to the Warhol near-duplicate the university already has. While . the university says the portrait is worth about $12 million, O'Neal's . lawyer estimated its value at just under $1 million, adding: 'The . University of Texas should have been satisfied with what they got.' Fawcett . died in Los Angeles after a long battle with cancer on the same day . that pop icon Michael Jackson passed away from an overdose of the . anesthetic propofol, given to help him sleep as he rehearsed for a . comeback tour. O’Neal has previously said he feels closer to Miss Fawcett when he is surrounded by her possessions. He said: ‘You know, Farrah was a very strong presence in my life. So strong. She permeated my mind and my being. She still does. She had that kind of hold on me. ‘I live in the same house that we lived in together. The things that are nice in my house are the things that she got me.’ Allegations: The university's lawyer, David Beck, told the jury that O'Neal removed the work from Fawcett's Wilshire Boulevard condominium shortly after she died in 2009 . Warhol created his two silkscreen portraits of the actress in 1980 and both could be seen hanging in her home in the 2009 NBC documentary about her battle with cancer, Farrah’s Story. O'Neal has said he intends to give the artwork to his son, Redmond. Redmond O'Neal is the only son between the actor and Fawcett. Redmond O'Neal, 28, who has accompanied his father to court throughout jury selection and days of pretrial motions, will not be able to sit in on the trial until after he testifies, Superior Court Judge William MacLaughlin ruled Monday. Controversy also shrouded O'Neal, when he donated Farrah's infamous red swimsuit to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C.. But Farrah's best-friend Alana Stewart has since fiercely defended O'Neal's move. 'Farrah would have been delighted about the presentation, as now this famous red bathing suit belongs to the American people,' she said.","Lawyer for the veteran actor claimed he was rightful owner of the painting .

A judge has said the rights of two Christian B&B owners to bar a gay couple from sharing a room were outweighed by the need to  correct ‘centuries of discrimination’ against gay people. The Supreme Court yesterday rejected the claim by Peter and Hazelmary Bull that they acted within the law when they refused a room to Steven Preddy and Martyn Hall because they were not a heterosexual married couple. The decision ends a five-year legal battle that began when Mr Preddy and Mr Hall, backed by the Government’s Equality and Human Rights Commission, took the Bulls to court under equality laws. Peter Bull, 74, and his wife Hazelmary, 69, the Christian owners of a guesthouse, lost their Supreme Court case . Lady Hale, Deputy President of the . Supreme Court, dismissed the Bulls’ appeal to the country’s highest . court, saying that discrimination against homosexuals was ‘an affront to . their dignity as human beings’. She . added that hundreds of years of persecution of gays had led European . human rights judges in Strasbourg to require strong reasons to justify . discrimination against them. ‘It . is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting . hotel keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a . disproportionate limitation on their right  to manifest their religion,’ Lady Hale said. It . follows a series of cases in which judges in London and Strasbourg have . found against Christians who dissented from gay rights laws. Among . those who lost were Lillian Ladele, a registrar in Islington who wanted . to avoid presiding at civil partnership ceremonies, and Gary McFarlane, . a Relate counsellor sacked after he was questioned by his employers . over his attitude to gay rights following a statement that he would not . give sex therapy to a gay couple. The guesthouse owners refused to let Steven Preddy (left) and Martin Hall stay in a double room . The . Bulls were taken to court after they turned Mr Hall and Mr Preddy away . from their Chymorvah Hotel, in Marazion, Cornwall, in September 2008. The . Supreme Court judges have upheld an earlier ruling that the Bulls, whose . lawyers were paid for by the Christian Institute think tank, must pay . £3,600 in compensation to Mr Hall and Mr Preddy. Mrs . Bull said yesterday: ‘We are deeply disappointed and saddened by the . outcome. We are just ordinary Christians who believe in the importance . of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Our B&B is not . just our business, it’s our home. ‘These beliefs are not based on  hostility to anyone. We certainly bear no ill-will to Steven and Martyn.’ She . added: ‘Britain ought to be a country of freedom and tolerance, but it . seems religious beliefs must play second fiddle to the new orthodoxy of . political correctness. Dismissing the appeal, Lady Hale, deputy president of the Supreme Court, said: 'Sexual orientation is a core component of a person's identity which requires fulfilment through relationships with others of the same orientation.' Homosexuals 'were long denied the possibility of fulfilling themselves through relationships with others', she said, adding: 'This was an affront to their dignity as human beings which our law has now (some would say belatedly) recognised. 'Homosexuals can enjoy the same freedom and the same relationships as any others. But we should not under-estimate the continuing legacy of those centuries of discrimination, persecution even, which is still going on in many parts of the world. 'It is no doubt for that reason that Strasbourg requires ""very weighty reasons"" to justify discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. 'It is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel-keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion.' If Mr Preddy and Mr Hall ran a hotel which denied a double room to Mr and Mrs Bull, whether on the grounds of their Christian beliefs or on the grounds of their sexual orientation, they would find themselves in the same situation that Mr and Mrs Bull find themselves today. 'We appealed to the Supreme Court to . introduce a bit more balance when dealing with competing rights of . sexual orientation and religious liberty. 'Somehow, we have got to find a way of allowing different beliefs to coexist in our society. 'But the judges have sidestepped that big issue, and reinforced the notion that gay rights must trump everything else. 'In . particular, we are deeply troubled by the remarks of Lady Hale, who . says rulings by European judges means gay rights are almost untouchable. 'What . does this mean for other people in Britain who believe in traditional . marriage - not just Christians, but Muslims, Jews, people of all faiths . and none? 'We ask Parliament to take a serious look at how Christians with traditional beliefs are being left out in the cold. 'We have no regrets about contesting this case, nor will we ever be ashamed of our beliefs. 'We . are not perfect people, but we are trying to do our best to live out . our faith with honesty and consistency. And we will continue to do that, . come what may.' The Bulls had accepted an £80-a-night double room booking, believing Steven Preddy, 38, would be staying with his wife. But when Mr Preddy arrived with his . 46-year-old civil partner Martyn Hall, the men, from Bristol, were told . they would not be able to share one room and instead had to sleep . separately. The Bulls denied . that they had discriminated against the couple, arguing that their . policy of only allowing married couples to sleep in a double bed, in . accordance with their religious beliefs, was applied to everyone, . regardless of sexual orientation. They said they had also prevented unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing double rooms since they opened 25 years ago. Mr Hall and Mr Preddy said they were victims of discrimination. The . Bulls have since been forced to close the B&B in September because their . falling income no longer covered the mortgage on the business they had . nurtured over three decades. They . suffered a drop in bookings following the controversy, which led to . negative reviews online, their website being hacked, property vandalised . and receiving death threats. The Bulls said they thought that any sex outside marriage was 'a sin' - and denied discriminating against Mr Hall and Mr Preddy . Christian Institute spokesman Mike Judge said: 'What this case shows is that the powers of political correctness have reached all the way to the top of the judicial tree. So much so that even the Supreme Court dare not say anything against gay rights. 'Writing the main opinion in the ruling, Lady Hale effectively said gay rights are almost untouchable because of the rulings by European judges. 'Combine that with gay marriage, and it's a recipe for all sorts of threats to people who believe in traditional marriage. 'This ruling is another slap in the face to Christians, and shows that the elite institutions are saturated with a liberal mindset which cares little about religious freedom. 'It should be noted that the one-sided laws which paved the way for this case, the Sexual Orientation Regulations 2007, were voted for by the now Prime Minister David Cameron. 'Parliament needs to reform the law to allow a more reasonable approach which balances competing rights. Otherwise, Christianity will become the belief that dare not speak its name.'","Guesthouse owners Peter Bull, 74, and his wife Hazelmary, 69, turned away Martyn Hall and his civil partner Steven Preddy .

Assistant District Attorney Janet Albertson said Underhill suffered more than a dozen blunt-force wounds to his head and face, as well as multiple fractured ribs, according to Newsday. There was also evidence of 'neck compression', causing a fractured bone in the back of his neck, she said. Albertson said the medical examiner's office determined that Underhill was still alive when he was submerged in the marsh.

Underhill caused a stir with what he wrote in the Islip High School yearbook. Under his photo was this quote: 'I don’t think I’ve ever known so many people I hated so much all at once. See you in Abbadon.' Abbadon commonly refers to the depths of hell. Brian Melton, a student at the community college, said he can't believe Liming would have any involvement in Underhill's death. 'They were the best of friends,' said Melton, 20. 'They were like brothers. Kyle and Tom got along famously.' Kyle Underhill caused a stir with the message he left in his yearbook, denouncing the people at his high school . 'Tom killing Kyle? That's impossible in my head.' Melton learned of Underhill's disappearance as he was traveling back from a friend's house.

Victim: Christopher Foster is believed to have been stabbed to death in a case of mistaken identity . A father who became the unintended victim of a gangland stabbing 'didn’t have an enemy in the world', friends said today. Chris Foster, 34, was attacked without warning as he smoked a cigarette with a friend outside a pub in Borough, London. Murder squad detectives believe he was mistaken for someone else by up to seven armed youths who were seen running away. The law firm administrative . clerk, who had a four-year-old daughter, suffered catastrophic internal . injuries and died an hour later in hospital. Since the tragedy on Friday, tributes have been flooding in for the father. Laying flowers at the scene of the murder, devastated friends of Mr Foster paid tribute said he was a 'proper gentleman' murdered while out for a 'Christmas drink.' One childhood friend who asked not to be identified said: 'His family are devastated, his daughter is devastated. 'There wasn’t a nicer or more genuine guy in the world. 'The geezer didn’t have one enemy in the world. It’s a complete case of mistaken identity. 'He was the most genuine, nicest person you could have met.' Dozens of friends met in a nearby pub to remember their friend on Saturday as news of his death spread through social media, she added. 'Christopher was always popular, the funniest bloke who would never have caused harm to anyone and never had any arguments in his life. 'When we heard the news on Saturday we met at a pub nearby as it sunk in. In memory: Scores of flowers and tributes have been left for Mr Foster near to the scene . 'Within no time there were more than thirty people there who knew him and had found out over social media. It amazes me so many people came together. 'It happened in outside St Christopher’s Inn and his name was Christopher, it’s ridiculous.' Another added: 'It’s really worrying, that you could be walking down the road and get stabbed. It could happen to anyone.' The murder took place outside the packed St Christopher’s Inn in Borough, south London. Mr Foster had gone into an alley to have a cigarette when he was stabbed fatally from behind with no warning shortly before midnight. Investigators believe his attackers may have been circling the area looking for another man to target, but they do not know why. Within moments, the gang ran off towards a nearby housing estate, making use of several back streets and alleys. Mr Foster was rushed to the Royal London Hospital, in East London, but died just over an hour later. Attack: The murder took place outside St Christopher's Inn, right, in Borough, south London . Crime: Mr Foster was outside the pub having a cigarette when he was attacked . Detective . Chief Inspector John Sandlin, who is leading the inquiry, said that the . victim was ‘entirely innocent’. He said: ‘We believe this was a case . of mistaken identity. He was out with his friends, minding his own . business. Chris was . standing there chatting with a friend when seven people come up the . alley and one of them stabs him in the back. 'Almost immediately five . carry on and two double back, there is a commotion and it appears they . have gone after someone else at the end of the alley. 'This was an . innocent guy doing what most of us are doing on a Friday night, . socialising with friends. ‘It . is a cowardly attack, made even more tragic by the fact there is a . four-year-old girl who has lost her dad.’ The senior officer said Mr . Foster was not struck with a baseball bat and no knives had been . recovered from the scene. He added: ‘We don’t know anything more than that they were hooded and carrying weapons, some may have been female. ‘A group of bystanders who were also out in the alleyway smoking administered first aid to Chris before the paramedics arrived. ‘At that time on a Friday night there will have been a lot of people in the area, someone must have seen something.’ Tribute: One of the emotional messages left for the victim near to the south London crime scene . 'Gone too soon': Another message pays tribute to Mr Foster, saying he was a 'great dad' In . recent years the maze of streets around trendy Borough Market, close to . the River Thames, has become a popular evening destination for young . professionals. But it is a short walk from some of the capital’s toughest estates. Today colleagues at international law firm Pinsent Masons where Mr Foster worked for six years as a facilities assistant paid tribute to the 'very popular' worker. Martin Roberts, Head of Pinsent Masons’ London office, said: 'Everyone at the firm was shocked and saddened to hear this news. 'Chris was a very popular member of staff and we are doing all that we can to support his family and colleagues at this difficult time.'

Roly Cater wrote: 'Shocked lost touch with Chris a few years back but my memories were always fond good laugh fun guy RIP my thoughts are firmly with his family.' Nichole Clarke said: 'So sad & unfair. My thoughts are with Chris’s family! R.I.P God Bless!' Those who knew Chris also posted tributes on Twitter, angry that he had been caught up in gang violence. RIP: Around 40 bunches of flowers have been left outside the pub today - which is close to one of London's toughest estates . Jess Dunphy wrote: 'I can’t believe you have been taken Chris Foster in such an awful way, it makes me feel sick.' Another, Paul Fiander wrote: 'I wish I had the vocabulary to express how much the loss of an old friend has shaken me. But instead I’m failing. R.I.P Chris Foster.' Around 40 bouquets of . flowers had also been left near to the scene.

Prime Minister David Cameron said he was determined to roll back the green levies which push up bills . David Cameron today signalled that green levies on energy bills will be cut within days, as the political row over living costs heated up. The Prime Minister said he was determined to ‘roll back' costs which add to pressures on family finances, ahead of next week's Autumn Statement. But Downing Street was forced to deny reports it had 'asked for a price freeze' in talks with energy firms in a bid to ensure gas and electricity charges did not rise ahead of the next election. and was still working on ways to ease the pressure on family finances. It was reported that ministers were urging the Big Six to hold prices until the . middle of 2015 if action is taken next week on curbing green levies which push . up costs. Labour leader Ed Miliband seized on the claims, to accuse Mr Cameron of 'flailing' around in search of an energy policy. 'What we now know is that while David Cameron has in public been opposing an energy price freeze, in private he has been pleading with the energy companies to get him off the hook,' Mr Miliband said. The Labour leader stepped up his calls for . the biggest overhaul of the energy market since the utilities were privatised. Since he unveiled his promise to freeze gas and electricity . bills from 2015 to early 2017, the government has been scrambling to find a way . to offer help to families now. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use the . Autumn Statement on Thursday to announce that up to £50 will be cut from bills by removing levies . used to fund green and social policies. Instead they will be funded from general taxation. Industry sources suggested last night that Energy Secretary Ed Davey had written to . the Big Six asking for a price freeze in return for the green levy cuts. But a Number 10 source said: 'This story is utterly misleading. The Government has not asked for a price freeze. People should wait for us to announce our plans.' Profits on the average bill have risen from £8 in 2009 to £53 in 2012, fuelled by a bitterly cold winter . Latest figures show the profits made from domestic bills has . risen by 75 per cent to £53. The Big Six – British Gas, Npower, E.ON, EDF, SSE and . Scottish Power – are pushing up prices by up to 10 per cent this winter. Speaking . at a summit in Lithuania today, Mr Cameron said: 'I've said all along I . want households and families to have sustainably low energy prices now . the only way you can do that is by increasing competition and rolling . back some of the costs of some of the levies. 'I've said that is what we are going to do and that is what we are going to do. 'That's a world away from saying you might do something in 20 months time with no ideas about how to do it. That is a con, we're talking about real policy.' Energy watchdog Ofgem this week warned the Big Six that 'making a profit is not an entitlement' after reveal a sharp rise in the money they made in 2012. But Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, today insisted the profits made by the companies were 'modest'. 'In the energy industry, we have got a lot of changes for customers coming through, but it also is very political,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'The energy situation is a lot more complicated than people often think. Only about 18 per cent of the bill comes from energy. 'The profits are pretty modest, not in the league of many other industries. Energy companies have to be profitable.’ Mr Miliband used a speech in Manchester today to set out more detail . of his plans to overhaul the energy market, which he would push through in the . 20 months that a Labour government would freeze prices. Labour leader Ed Miliband, in a speech at Manchester town hall, called for a two-year freeze to give time to overhaul the energy market . He pledged to end the energy ‘rip-off’ and call for a . tough new regulator, and an independent body to plan new infrastructure and . ensure the lights stay on. He also promised action to boost competition among . suppliers, and simplify bills for customers. The shake-up - described by Mr Miliband as the biggest . since privatisation in the 1980s - would be implemented during the 20 month . price freeze planned if Labour wins the general election. ‘In the past three years it has become clear to everyone . but this government that the energy market is broken,’ he said. ‘Prices are rising year on year without justification. And Britain is not getting the investment in energy we need to secure supplies . for the future.’ An independent Energy Security Board would be created . modelled on the Office for Budget Responsibility, to help draw up and implement . a timetable for building energy capacity. A new regulator will have powers to order firms to pass . on wholesale savings to customers, and intervene in the market to ensure . consumers will get good value in the future. Other commitments in the green paper include preventing . power generation companies doing exclusive deals with their retail arms and ensuring . all environmental and policy levies on bills are delivering ‘value for money’.","Ministers write to energy companies seeking deal on two-year price freeze .

Debutante Lady Rose, played by 24-year-old Lily James, is at Buckingham Palace to be presented to society in a floor-length white gown, white gloves and an elaborate feathered head dress. Usually up to mischief, she behaves herself as she curtseys for King George V and his wife Queen Mary. But despite being surrounded by a host of wealthy bachelors, the moment is likely to prove bittersweet for Rose, who viewers know is in love with jazz singer Jack Ross, the show’s first black character, who called off their engagement at the end of Series Four.

For hardened criminals that have spent a lifetime trying to evade the police, politely offering to get The Bill might not come naturally. But that's exactly what inmates from HMP Prescoed and HMP Cardiff will soon be doing when they swap their overalls for aprons and sharp suits to work at a new restaurant inside the high security Cardiff jail. You might expect an eatery run by prisoners to serve up stodgy dishes, but the aptly named Clink Cymru restaurant will provide high quality food in a fine-dining environment. Scroll down for video . Jailly and ice cream: The clink restaurant is opening up inside HMP Cardiff - a high security Category D prison . Tasty treat: Behind the scenes look at the soon to open The Clink restaurant at Cardiff Prison . A total of 30 cateogry D prisoners will be offered jobs as chefs, waiters and cleaners at the new restaurant which can serve up to 96 people at any one time. The diner will be the second of its kind to be launched in the UK following the opening of The Clink at HMP High Down in Surrey three years ago. Employees at the new restaurant in Cardiff will all be criminals who are all close to their release date with  no drug addiction or anger management issues. Alberto Crisci - formerly a chef at Mirabelle in London's Mayfair, which was once owned by Marco Pierre White, cooked up the concept and is the man behind the Wales venture. Talking about why he decided to embark on the new scheme Crisci, who will be assisted by head chef Mike Arnopp, said he wanted to help prisoners stand on their own two feet again after their release. He said: 'Once the prisoners come to prison they've committed a crime. Garnish: Head chef, Mike Arnopp, left, and director of operations, Al Crisci, right, put the finishing touches on some of the new dishes prisoners will be serving up . Haute cuisine: The meals on the menu are more Michelin Star than prison gruel . 'If it was your son would you prefer that he was banged up, beaten, treated with disrespect, treated inhumanely? 'As far as I'm concerned he's in . prison, he's lost his freedom and he has to do what he's told 24 hours a . day and that's his punishment. 'If . he has no qualifications, if he has no prospects, when he is released . if they have no job, no family, no accommodation, no qualifications the . likelihood is they are going to come back. We're trying to break that . cycle. 'It's a very . short-term view to say get them in, bang them up, treat them bad, they . won't come back. If they have no other choice, no other means of finding . a job, of supporting themselves, the chances are they will come back.' Prisoners will earn £14 for a 40-hour week, working five days a week, 52 weeks of the year, with no holiday. They . must return to their respective jails at the end of every shift and . only inmates with between six to 18 months left on their jail terms . qualify for the project. Fine dining: Appropriately named The Clink restaurant, left, includes dishes such as Papardell with squid in tomato and garlic sauce served with seasoned salad on the menu, right . The goal of the restaurant is to . reduce the chances of re-offending as 74 per cent of prisoners with no . job or accommodation currently commit another crime within a year. The . results of the restaurant in Surrey show a dramatic impact on this with . only 10 per cent of those who have worked at the diner reoffending . within a year. In addition to providing a new employment route after leaving jail the Clink charity also assists prisoners with things like CVs and disclosure forms. The restaurant has a strict zero tolerance policy – and introduces father figures to prisoners who may never have been told off or indeed praised. Lags of lamb: Porridge isn't likely to feature on the high-class menu for The Clink restaurant . It is also hoped that providing a direct link between prisoners and the public will help to change perceptions about prisoners. Everything at the restaurant – from full meals to biscuits and bread – is made from scratch by the prisoners. Even the tables and chairs have been made by offenders, and the food is sourced from a prison farm at HMP Prescoed. The restaurant, which will open its doors on September 19 will serve breakfast and lunch between Monday and Friday, but initially at least will not offer alcohol. If the restaurant proves as successful as its forerunner in Surrey the plan is to open two more Clink restaurants every year for the next four years at prisons across the country.","A total of 30 cateogry D prisoners will be offered jobs as chefs, waiters and cleaners .

Accusations: Jhona Mathews, 33, has accused William McLaughlin of sexually assaulting and harassing her while they both worked at one of San Francisco's oldest Catholic shrines . Kinky sex in the sanctuary, embezzlement and racy photos are causing scandal at one of San Francisco's oldest Catholic churches. The accusations flying out of the National Shrine of St. Francis of Assisi have led to the 'comprehensive investigation of alleged improper behavior' involving the shrine's volunteer chairman, William McLaughlin and admin- assistant, Jhona Mathews, 33 - costing them both their jobs. According to shrine spokesman, Larry Kamer, a police report was filed last week alleging that Mathews had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from the church. Mathews, in turn, has filed a sexual harassment claim against the church, alleging that McLaughlin forced her to have sex with him inside the church's sanctuary. 'McLaughlin spanked her and forced her to engage in sexual intercourse with him' in order to keep her job, alleged Sandra Ribera, who is acting as Mathews's attorney. 'Paddling with a wooden paddle, getting spanked in the sacristy of the shrine of St. Francis, which Catholics know, it's just appalling to hear as a Catholic and having sexual intercourse in the shrine of St. Francis,' added Ribera. McLaughlin, who is believed to be in his 60s and is a wealthy Marin County real-estate developer, acts as the chairman of the shrine's volunteer program. Scandal: The National Shrine of St. Francis of Assisi conducted a 'comprehensive investigation of alleged improper behavior' involving the shrine's volunteer chairman, William McLaughlin and Jhona Mathews, . He briefly reached national prominence in 2005, when he arranged for a massive airlift of New Orleans pets that had been stranded by Hurricane Katrina. According to Kamer, McLaughlin has been relieved of his duties following the scandal and Mathews has been fired. Mathews first met McLaughlin when the carpet firm she was working for helped to renovate the residence of shrine that San Francisco's Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone shares with the archdiocese's vicar general. Mathews was offered a job in February 2012 as an admin-assistant and Ribera alleges that her client was soon experiencing sexual harassment from McLaughlin. Face-off: Sandra Ribera, who is acting as Mathews's attorney claims the abuse occurred inside the church while shrine spokesman, Larry Kamer, says that Jhona Mathews embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the church . 'She felt she had no choice,' Ribera said to the San Francisco Chronicle. 'He was dangling her livelihood over her head, and she had a daughter to feed.' Jhona Mathews is a single mother in her early 30s with a 2-year-old child. She worked as an assistant to the church rector Father Harold Sinider. She says the president of the church board of trustees Bill McLaughlin forced her into having sex with him . Mathews allegedly broke off the affair in October and filed her police report after she was fired last week. 'McLaughlin spanked her and forced her to engage in sexual intercourse with him' in order to keep her job, Ribera said. She also alleges that McLaughlin sent her sexy e-mails and photos - which she did not want or reciprocate. Church officials are claiming that Mathews was fired after evidence was found that she had stolen up to 'six figures' from the church. ABC7 News learned that early last week, the church filed a police report charging Mathews with embezzlement. Ribera categorically denies her client stole from the church. The church has now launched an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment. ABC7 news tried to contact McLaughlin, the man Mathews says sexually abused her but he did not respond.","Jhona Mathews, 33, claims she was spanked with paddles and pressured into sex inside the sanctuary of he National Shrine of St. Francis of Assisi .

It was absolutely therapeutic.’ Because she was so young, Arngrim says she didn't tell anyone when the abuse started. ‘I wasn't quite completely clear on exactly what it was that was being done to go report this,’ she said. ‘So when I started to get older and realize what it was, that's when I actually said “No, I'm not doing this anymore.” And amazingly, it stopped.’ Little House On The Prairie star Alison Arngrim says her cast mates never knew about her abuse and she even kept the secret from her family .

When asked about the nature of the abuse, she replied: 'Obviously I prefer not to go into specific, graphic details, but really, at six I did not understand exactly what was happening.

'To be 11 or 12 and have everyone call you a bitch to your face every day of your life is very strange,' she told The Today Show in 2010.

Amy Robach has opened up about her cancer diagnosis and treatment, saying how she is 'proud' of the 'Frankenstein-like' scars she has as a result of her double mastectomy and lymph node removal. The Good Morning America correspondent has been off TV ever since an on-air mammogram led to the discovery that she had stage 2 cancer in both of her breasts and her lymph nodes. 'It’s going to be a crappy year, and then I'll be on drugs for probably the next 10 years and there are other issues down the road that we're discussing and we're dealing with. It's about being vigilant and taking care of myself,' she told People Magazine. Looking great: Amy was first spotted back at ABC studios on Wednesday but she didn't go on air that day . [embed https://twitter.com/arobach/status/408241642487832576/photo/1] . Robach, 40, initially announced that her aggressive route of treatment meant that she would be able to return to the news set on Monday December 2 and while she hasn't been seen on the show yet this week, she was featured in a cover story in People where she told about the arduous recovery process. After being initially hesitant to have a mammogram during a breast cancer awareness campaign headlined by GMA anchor Robin Roberts, Robach now credits the move with saving her life. A few weeks later, she was called back to the doctor's office for further testing wherein they discovered that there was a second tumor in the same breast and abnormal cells in the other breast. 'For me, given my age, given the fact that I have young children, I was going to be aggressive,' she told People. High spirits: Robach said that while the disease has taken an emotional toll on her, she is determined to live to see her young children grow up . 'I want to be at my daughter's graduations, their weddings. I want to hold my grandkids. That just becomes your focus.' The cancer had spread to her lymph nodes as well, and all told she had 13 nodes removed. 'That was the most pain. The breast surgery was painful, but there was nothing like the pain that my arm felt,' she told the magazine. Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were. Staying positive: After an on-air mammogram revealed that she had a tumor in one of her breasts, further tests revealed that she had a second tumor, more abnormal cells and the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes . Support: Robach's husband Andrew Shue has been on hand throughout the ordeal, seen here on set when she announced that she had cancer . Driving force: Robach, 40, chose the most aggressive form of treatment- a double mastectomy- because she has young children and much to live for, saying she didn't want the chance of a second bout hanging over her . They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery. Even though she remains 'resolute' in her decision to choose the most aggressive form of treatment, it has been an emotionally taxing process.

November 22: Robach writes an emotional and upbeat memo to ABC staffers saying she is 'excited' to be back at work on December 2. December 4: Robach is seen entering ABC studios but does not appear on air. 'I'll be honest: there have been a couple of nights where I've sobbed myself to sleep,' she said. Publicly, she has remained extremely upbeat throughout the process and wrote an email to her colleagues on November 22. 'Physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger,' she wrote in the memo. She ended the grateful email with her plans to return: 'As of right now, I plan to head back into the building Monday, December 2nd and I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work.' That never ended up happening and she has not made an appearance on the air at all this week. Instead, the GMA staff had to deal with a surprise departure as well as her planned return as it was revealed this weekend that longtime weatherman Sam Champion was leaving the network and headed to The Weather Channel to launch his own flagship morning show. Much of GMA on Wednesday was dedicated to Champion, with tributes, highlight reels and even the unveiling of a 100-square-foot mosaic of his face made entirely of marshmallows. ABC press representatives refused to comment on the timing of Amy's return in relation to Sam's sudden departure, only reiterating how well she is doing.","GMA correspondent Amy Robach said that she chose the most aggressive form of treatment because of her age and the age of her children .

Olympic diver Tom Daley was dating a woman only a few months before meeting his boyfriend – believed to be an Oscar-winning gay activist 20 years his senior. The 19-year-old met Hollywood screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, 39, in March, after the Nickelodeon Annual Kids’ Choice Awards in Los Angeles. While Daley has refused to name his boyfriend, friends said Black was the mystery man. Daley, who won bronze at last year’s London Olympics, told The Jonathan Ross Show, which airs on Saturday, that it was ‘love at first sight’, but admitted it was a shock to find he had fallen for a man. He said: ‘People say “why did he have a girlfriend last year?”. Well, because I had a girlfriend last year. ‘And it wasn’t until spring this year, it came upon me. I didn’t expect it and it happened. Everything kind of clicked, everything went right.’ When Ross asked if he was surprised by his feelings, Daley replied: ‘It was the fact I was falling for a guy and it happened so quickly.’ Daley said he did not want to label himself as gay or bisexual, adding: ‘To be honest, everything is all pretty new and I don’t see any point in putting a label on it.’ Last night, friends said Daley was . dating a female friend as recently as March – but broke up with her when . he met Black. A source said: ‘Tom was dating a girl, an old friend of . his, for a few months when he went to LA for the awards. ‘Their . relationship was pretty informal, but when he got back, she heard he . had met someone else. She was pretty upset because she had feelings for . him, but she had no idea it was a man until this week. ‘Everything fell into place and she heard who he was seeing. She is happy for him, but it was a surprise.’ Couple? Tom Daley and Dustin Lance Black were spotted together in Los Angeles . Daley told Ross his boyfriend was his first real love, saying: ‘I can’t get him out of my head all the time’. Black won an Academy Award in 2008 for best original screenplay for his film Milk, starring Sean Penn, which is based on the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. He co-founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights and has been repeatedly listed in OUT Magazine’s ‘50 Most Powerful LGBT persons’. Last weekend Black attended the Side By Side Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgender Film Festival in St. Petersburg, Russia. It was really love at first sight. I've never felt anything like it before. I hadn't even talked to him and I was like, wow. I didn't know what to do . Tom Daley . But his reputation as a safe-sex advocate was marred in 2009 when gossip columnist Perez Hilton published explicit photographs of Black having unprotected sex. The screenwriter later issued an apology. Black answered the door of his £1million Los Angeles home yesterday, but did not comment when asked about his relationship with Daley. The gated English Tudor-style four-bedroom house is set just off Sunset Boulevard. Daley has made a number of secret visits to California and the pair were pictured drinking coffee together in Los Angeles in October. The coffee shop is within walking distance of Black’s home. Yesterday Black wrote on his Facebook profile: ‘Slept all day today after my trip to Russia. Did I miss anything?’ Friends then appeared to confirm rumours he was in a relationship with Daley by posting swimming puns in response to the message. Jayden Parker O’Neal wrote: ‘Let me take a dive into this. Nope, everything is just swimming along. Marc Wheeler said: ‘Oh, you know, just a little something about some Olympic athlete dating some equally gorgeous and wonderful man, but other than that, no.’ Together: Tom was rumoured to be dating US diver Kassidy Cook last year . While Daley never mentioned his name, the young diver seemed more than happy to talk about his boyfriend on Ross’s show, which had been brought forward to coincide with his announcement. He said he was instantly attracted to him, telling Ross: ‘It really was love at first sight. I’ve never felt anything like it before. I hadn’t even talked to him and I was like okay, wow, I didn’t know what to do.’ He described how he walked over to the man and typed his phone number into his mobile. He added: ‘I have never had it before where I love someone and they love me just as much as I love them. I am used to – believe it or not – rejection when it comes to girls and dating. Honestly, seriously. ‘I have never been in a position before where I have felt so happy. I thought I felt feelings like it before but this way surpasses all of it. Nothing compares.’ Dining out: Tom Daley leaving Itsumo Japanese Restaurant in London, after his confession video was made public . Daley said his boyfriend supported his decision to announce he was in a gay relationship, which he declared via a YouTube video message on Monday. He also said his partner had encouraged him to keep diving when he wanted to quit earlier this year. He said: ‘He just gave that extra motivation and made me think, yeah, and he just made me work so hard. He’s just exactly what I need.’ Black’s agent and publicist did not return calls or emails about Daley. When asked about Black, Daley’s spokesman said he would ‘not be making any comments today’.

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:35 EST, 1 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:58 EST, 2 December 2013 . Record numbers of anorexia sufferers - some aged just nine - are being admitted to hospital, according to shocking figures. File picture . Record numbers of anorexia sufferers – some aged just nine – are being admitted to hospital, according to shocking figures. Every night, 350 hospital beds across England on average are taken up by a patient desperately ill with anorexia, bulimia or another eating disorder. The figures have doubled in a decade. Last year, 15 children aged only between five and nine were admitted to hospital with eating disorders, underlining fears that unhealthy obsessions with food are developing very early. There is also growing concern that the NHS is worsening the crisis by refusing to treat patients because they are not deemed thin enough. Many clinics turn patients away until they fall below a certain body weight. One young woman told this when she appealed for help condemned it as a ‘perverse incentive’ to lose weight. The figures come after the NHS was heavily criticised in a report by the Patients Association. It revealed how a gifted 19-year-old died  following failings by GPs, hospital doctors and psychologists. Averil Hart was meant to have weekly check-ups but was allowed to become so thin that she slurred her words and was later found  collapsed in her student flat. Patients with anorexia, bulimia or other eating disorders accounted for 122,150 bed nights in 2012/13. This is up from 100,550 in 2011/12, said the Health and Social Care Information Centre. In contrast, 51,878 bed days were taken up by such patients in 2002/3. A total of 2,381 patients were admitted to hospital last year, three-quarters with anorexia. The figure is up from 2,287 in the previous 12 months. Girls aged 15 are by far the most likely to be taken to hospital, with 200 admitted last year. Charities said these figures are the ‘tip’ of the iceberg as they do not include thousands of sufferers battling eating disorders at home. Laura Willmott, who died from anorexia aged just 18. She weighed just 5st when she died . When she collapsed and died, former private schoolgirl Laura Willmott weighed barely 5st. The 18-year-old had fought anorexia for five years and was admitted to hospital when she was so thin that she could barely walk. But she was discharged 11 days later when doctors deemed her ‘physically fit’. They did not discuss their decision with her parents as she was over 18. Miss Willmott, who went to  Colston Girls School, Bristol, was taken by her mother to A&E in October 2011. After being discharged, she continued to starve herself at home and refused to see a GP. The teenager, who hoped to be a nurse, suffered cardiac arrest a month later and died of brain damage a week later. At her inquest in February this year, her mother Vickie Townsend said: ‘She became frailer and frailer. She was not strong enough to walk. To get around inside the house, she had to crawl. ‘It is impossible to describe the impact of Laura’s death on my family or explain our experience of Laura’s dreadful journey as a teenager with anorexia to her demise at 18. She was a wonderful daughter and a very talented and supremely caring human being.’ They also do not take into account patients at private clinics who have given up on the NHS due to the lengthy waiting times. Leanne Thorndyke, of the eating disorder charity BEAT, said:  ‘People often tell us that they were told their BMI (body mass index) was not low enough. ‘With most other illnesses, no-one would tell a patient to go away and come back when their problem was a lot worse. ‘Yet people with eating disorders are often made to become even more dangerously ill before getting the help they so desperately need. Eating disorders are serious  mental illnesses.’ This year, a survey of 500 patients by the charity found a quarter had waited at least six months for treatment while nearly one in ten had been waiting for more than a year. A total of 2,381 patients were admitted to hospital last year, three-quarters with anorexia. The figure is up from 2,287 in the previous 12 months. File picture . Kat Pugh, 24, of London, who has had anorexia since she was only 11, said: ‘I’m trying to get NHS treatment but I’m not deemed sick enough. It is like a perverse incentive scheme to get worse.’ Around 3 per cent of adults are thought to have an eating disorder but some estimates suggest it could be 6.5 per cent. Women make up 90 per cent of cases. A fifth of anorexia sufferers die from complications caused by starving themselves, including organ damage or heart failure. The proliferation of pro-anorexia websites has been blamed for the rise of eating disorders in the young, especially in girls. There are around 400 to 500 such sites where users swap tips on how to starve themselves and boast about how few calories they have consumed.","350 hospital beds are taken up with victims of eating disorders each night .

A military couple whose engagement ring was secretly bought by actor Paul Walker came forward today after finally having their suspicions confirmed that the star was behind the act of amazing generosity. Soldier Kyle Upham and his new wife Kristen were in a Santa Barbara jewellery store in 2004 looking for a diamond ring shortly before he was sent on his second deployment back to Iraq. The couple quickly realized that the other shopper in the store was Fast And The Furious star Walker and struck up a conversation. Kyle revealed to the actor that he had just come back from a tour of duty in Iraq. Scroll down for video . Kristen Upham, pictured with her husband Kyle, said that Paul Walker's generous purchase of her $10,000 engagement ring is the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for her . Paul Walker's secret act of generosity - buying a $9,000 engagement ring for an Iraq war veteran and his new wife - was revealed by the jewellery store following the star's tragic death . Kristen Upham told CBS today: 'When he found out Kyle just came back . from Iraq - I remember seeing the look in his face. He . kind of transformed.' The couple, from Victorville, ultimately left the store without a ring - after they decided they could not afford the $9,000 diamond band that Mrs Upham had set her heart on. A short time later, a sales assistant called the couple and told them to return to the store - where they were presented with the ring. Walker had sought out the manager of the store and told him to put the ring 'on his tab'. When they astounded couple asked who bought it for them, the clerks refused to say - at Walker's request. The Uphams kept the gift receipt and often suspected it had been the star but could never be certain. The store, which has since closed its Santa Barbara outlet, . kept Walker's secret but after the 40-year-old's tragic death in a car . crash on Saturday, employee Irene King felt the world should know the actor's true . character. Mrs Upham said Walker's gesture remains the kindness thing anyone had ever done for her. She added: 'His real life speaks volumes of his character. He really did put his money where his mouth is and did good for this world.' Kyle Upham, from Victorville, California, served two tours of duty in Iraq. He married wife Kristen in 2004 .

Viewers will also be treated to showings of Kung Fu Panda, Cars 2, Pirates of The Carribbean: On Stranger Tides, and Meet The Parents sequel Little Fockers.

The team had scoured the ABC archives and aired some retro clips of Champion's early days at the station. The weather presenter howled with laughter as he watched a clip of himself from 1989. 'I sound like Elvis!' he said, before George Stephanopoulos added: 'I like the Doogie Howser haircut!' Sad goodbyes: Champion (far right) bid farewell to the rest of the GMA team on Wednesday (L-R) Josh Elliott, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Lara Spencer . Champion has been part of the winning GMA team that has seen the show become the most-watched morning program . During the show, Champion tweeted: 'Last morning on @gma ! THANK YOU for being here this am!' Robin Roberts later posted: 'I'll be easy to spot this morning on @GMA. I'll be the one clinging to @SamChampion's leg screaming: DON'T GO!!! #PartingIsSuchSweetSorrow'. Champion is set to anchor The Weather Channel's new flagship morning show, which will debut in early 2014. Based at The Weather Channel headquarters in Atlanta, Champion will also assume managing editor responsibilities at the network. Champion called his new post 'a . once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to do what I love most at a . network that lives and breathes the weather'. Champion, who has been with GMA since 2006, and joined ABC-owned local New York station WABC in 1988. Champion was in fits of laughter as tapes from the ABC archives were brought back to haunt him . Sam Champion and Josh Elliott became very emotional as they said goodbye on their last breakfast show together . Ginger Zee, who was on the ground in Denver, Colorado, this morning to cover the severe winter storm, will take over from Champion as weather presenter at GMA . 'For 25 years, Sam has been a vital member of the ABC News family,' said ABC News president Ben Sherwood in announcing Champion's departure. Champion has been a member of the GMA anchor team as it seized the ratings crown from NBC's perennially front-running Today show. Whether his absence from the GMA anchor desk affects its ratings dominance will be closely tracked by morning-TV handicappers. GMA weather presenter Sam Champion said goodbye to viewers this morning on his last show before he heads to the Weather Channel . And he leaves the network scrambling to keep intact the rest of its winning GMA ensemble, led by anchor George Stephanopoulos, Josh Elliott, Robin Roberts and Lara Spencer are reportedly negotiating new contracts. Ironically, in his new role, Champion now joins forces with his former rival, Today weather co-host Al Roker, whose one-hour Wake Up With Al airs on The Weather Channel weekdays at 6am (EST), then repeats at 10am. Champion's new morning show will be tucked in between, airing from 7 to 10am, the network said. Meanwhile, Champion will also be in the partial employ (in a sense) of his old network rival: The Weather Channel is owned by a consortium made up in part of NBC Universal.","Champion, who has been with GMA since 2006, is leaving for the Weather Channel .

But, as these photos from her glossy new beauty campaign prove, Courteney Cox is defying the ageing process. The 49-year-old, who found fame as Monica Geller on cult show Friends, showed off shiny locks and radiant skin as she posed for her debut shoot for haircare brand Pantene. And while she may be able to afford the most luxurious products, the actress has revealed the cheap and simple secrets to youth as nothing more than sleep and water. Age defying: Courteney Cox, 49, looks young beyond her years in her latest beauty campaign for Pantene . Speaking about growing old, she said: 'It's a constant daily vicious battle trying to fight that clock.

'I'm all about trying to find the next beauty secret. I really do spend a lot of time trying products, I'm crazy for it. What's her secret?

'But I would say the most important thing to do to keep up with time would be drink a boat load of water and sleep is imperative.'

'One day I was on the set of my show and my hairdresser said: ""Your hair is different, what are you using? I can't even get the comb through it"" and I just said, ""I'm using the same thing I've been using forever.

Giving it some oomph: Courteney says she worries about how her hair has been getting duller and thinner with age . 'I thought it was really strange and started wondering if it was hormones. 'I wasn't aware that my hair was ageing but things were changing, it was getting duller, drier, thinner and more brittle,' she said.

Many people worry about piling on the pounds or arguing with the in-laws at Christmas, but new research suggests there are other hidden dangers. More than half of women risk unwanted pregnancy at Christmas, a survey has revealed. Some 51 per cent forget to take their contraceptive pill, have to get the morning after pill, or have an unplanned pregnancy during the festive season, the researchers found. They believe these lapses are down to drunken partying, hectic diaries and visiting family. The research comes from LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor which says its data shows a 32 per cent increase in the use of its online contraception services at Christmas. The pharmacy interviewed 2,000 women and discovered one in six have forgotten to take the Pill because they were drunk. One in seven have missed taking it because they were distracted by the hustle and bustle of Christmas. According to the survey, one in six women have missed taking the Pill for a few days while they struggled to get a repeat prescription. And one in three say they find it hard to see a doctor or nurse in December. Another 28 per cent admit to failing to take the Pill because they had gone to stay with relatives and forgotten to pack it. As a result, it is perhaps no surprise that 13 per cent of women admit to having had to take the morning after pill over Christmas and one in 14 say they have needed it after their office Christmas party.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 11:42 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:41 EST, 4 December 2013 . Good Morning America correspondent Amy Robach's return to ABC has been pushed back from the previously announced date as the network was side-lined by the sudden announcement that their weather anchor would be leaving the show just days later. Robach has been off the air since discovering via a televised mammogram that she had breast cancer that spread to her lymph nodes. She had a double mastectomy and 13 lymph nodes removed, and sent a grateful email out to colleagues on November 22 announcing that she would be back on the small screen on December 2. All smiles: Amy Robach, seen here on Wednesday, had a successful operation to remove the cancer and has told how it will be a long recovery process but she has yet to appear back on TV . High spirits: Robach said that while the disease has taken an emotional toll on her, she is determined to live to see her young children grow up and get back to work . Support: She tweeted this photo of she and Champion in the ABC studios shortly after GMA ended on Wednesday . That never happened as she did not appear on Monday's broadcast nor has she been seen on the program this week- even though she has been in ABC studios. Instead, the GMA staff had to deal with a surprise departure as well as her planned return as it was revealed this weekend that longtime weatherman Sam Champion was leaving the network and headed to The Weather Channel to launch his own flagship morning show. The news of Champion's departure only broke over the weekend and his last day on the news program was this morning. ABC press representatives refused to comment on the timing of Amy's return in relation to Sam's sudden departure, only reiterating how well she is doing. Robach made that point herself as she was pictured smiling as she entered the Manhattan offices of ABC this morning. She followed that with a photo of her own- posting a picture of her hugging Champion behind the scenes this morning with a shirtless cardboard cutout of him in the background. Last day: Sam Champion is leaving ABC after 25 years with the network and heading up a new show on The Weather Channel . Happy faces: The cast dedicated much of the last week to celebrating their departing comrade, never mentioning the fact that the return date for Amy Robach has been pushed back- and not for health reasons . 'I love @samchampion soooo much... Especially his hot bod! #missualready,' she posted at 9.29am New York time. Much of GMA on Wednesday was dedicated to Champion, with tributes, highlight reels and even the unveiling of a 100-square-foot mosaic of his face made entirely of marshmallows. October 1: In front of millions of viewers, a hesitant Robach undergoes her first mammogram as part of GMA's Breast Cancer Awareness campaign. Host Robin Roberts, who is a breast cancer survivor herself, urged the 40-year-old correspondent to have the test. October 30: Robach goes back to the doctor's office for further tests where they confirmed that she had two tumors in one breast, abnormal cells in the other and 13 cancerous lymph nodes. November 14: She underwent a bilateral mastectomy. They were able to save her nipples and doctors inserted expanders behind her chest muscle to stretch the area before inserting implants in a few months with a second surgery. November 22: Robach writes an emotional and upbeat memo to ABC staffers saying she is 'excited' to be back at work on December 2. The weekend of November 30 and December 1: News that Sam Champion will be leaving ABC to work at The Weather Channel. December 2: Champion and the GMA co-hosts confirm the news during the show, lavishing him with praise and wishing him the best. Robach does not appear on air. December 4: Champion's last day is celebrated throughout the program. Robach tweets a photo of she and Champion hugging backstage. The spectacle for Champion was thrown together over the weekend, and was publicly announced on Good Morning America on Monday where his co-hosts lathered him with praise. The effusive send off appears to be ABC's attempt to have the complete opposite situation that rival program The Today Show faced when one of their co-hosts, Ann Curry, left the show under significantly more tense circumstances. In their efforts to make sure that Champion- and viewers- felt loved as he left, they effectively over shadowed the return of Robach. On November 22, she wrote a memo to ABC staff proclaiming that while she had 'been through the ringer' with her cancer treatment, she was excited to return. 'As of right now, I plan to head back into the building Monday, December 2nd and I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work,' she wrote in the email. That never ended up happening and she has not made an appearance on the air at all this week. Media insiders are not the only ones noticing, as a number of Robach's Twitter followers responded to her photo this morning. 'How are you Amy. I thought GMA would give us an update,' a woman named Christine wrote. 'So nice to see you. Hope you are back on the air soon,' another user wrote. The last-minute side-lining of Robach becomes even more pointed as this week's issue of People magazine begins to hit newsstands today, with the mom-of-five on the cover. Under normal circumstances, GMA would have likely done a segment welcoming her back and tying it into the publication of her cover story.","GMA correspondent Amy Robach learned that she had a cancerous tumor in her breast after an on-air mammogram .

The attack came as fresh pictures emerged from the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in the aftermath of an alleged airstrike by government forces. At least another 30 people died earlier in the week in violence across the country, and it was the second bombing in the Lebanese neighborhood of Haret Hreik this month. Flames could be seen pouring from a multi-storey building as firefighters tried desperately to extinguish the flames, and thousands lined the street as the dead and injured were stretchered from the scene.

Lebanese emergency personnel carry a body on stretcher from the scene of an apparent suicide car bombing in Beirut's southern neighbourhood of Haret Hreik .

At least four people have been killed in the explosion in a stronghold of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah in the Lebanese capital Beirut . The . violence has targeted both Sunnis and Shiites, and further stoked . sectarian tensions that are already running high on opposing sides of the Syrian . conflict. It was the second bombing in the neighborhood of Haret Hreik this month amid a series of attacks that have shaken Lebanon in a spillover of Syria's civil war into its smaller neighbor. It comes as a military police photographer has smuggled out of Syria evidence of the torture and killing of 11,000 detainees, according to a report by three former war crimes prosecutors. The shocking images show emaciated corpses with strangulation marks, cuts, bruising and signs of electrocution – evidence of extreme torture, claim investigators. Some victims had no eyes. The 55,000 photos will ratchet up the pressure on President Bashar Al Assad who the US and its Western allies – including the UK – say has committed war crimes against his own people. Assad denies the claims, insisting he is fighting terrorists. The attack came as fresh pictures emerged from the northern Syrian city of Aleppo after an alleged airstrike by government forces.

More than 130,000 people have been killed in Syria's nearly three-year war, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates, and millions more have been forced to flee their homes . Today's explosion on a crowded street left 35 people wounded as it shattered shop windows, set cars ablaze and left debris across the pavement according to the Lebanese Red Cross. Footage broadcast by the Hezbollah-owned al-Manar television station showed medics hauling a man on a stretcher out of the area as flames engulfed a building. A group known as the Nusra Front in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in retaliation for Hezbollah's military support of President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria. The claim, which could not be independently verified, was posted on the group's Twitter account. Its name suggested ties to the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front in Syria, one of the most powerful rebel factions. Lebanon's state media said a suicide car bomber was behind the attack. A security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the vehicle was stolen and packed with 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of explosives.

'There was a car beeping, and then it exploded,' an unnamed eyewitness told the Voice of Lebanon radio station. 'Then we saw people on the ground - like every time.' Similar attacks have targeted Shiite areas in Lebanon in recent months, apparently the work of Syria-based Sunni rebels or militant Islamist groups fighting to topple Assad who have threatened to target Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in retaliation for intervening on behalf of his government in the conflict. On Thursday, a car bomb struck the northeastern Shiite town of Hermel close to the Syrian border during rush hour, killing at least three people and wounding more than 20. And on January 2, a bombing in Haret Hreik just meters (yards) from where Tuesday's attack occurred killed five people. Lebanese citizens gather at the site of a car bombing. Thousands lined the street as the dead and injured were stretchered from the scene . Another attack in November targeted the Iranian Embassy and killed at least 23 people. Iran is the chief patron of Hezbollah and an ally of Syria. Lebanon's Sunni community has also been hit, most notably by a deadly double car bombing outside Sunni mosques in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli in August. A December car bombing in Beirut killed prominent Sunni politician Mohammed Chatah. The attacks raise the specter of a sharply divided Lebanon being dragged further into the Syrian conflict. Shortly after Tuesday's bombing, clashes broke out in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, killing at least one person, said the security official. The city, with impoverished rival Sunni and Shiite areas, has seen frequent sectarian clashes linked to the war Syria that have killed dozens. The latest fighting unraveled a tenuous truce in effect earlier in the morning, following clashes that broke out between the rival neighborhoods on Saturday.","Comes as fresh pictures emerge .

Five people were killed and one person is fighting for his life after they went ‘hill-jumping’ in their car in Hamilton County, Illinois, on Saturday. The six relatives went driving after an early Thanksgiving celebration that same evening on a road popular among the locals for its ‘thrill hills’. But they never made it home after the driver lost control of the vehicle, which flipped multiple times. Diana Wright, 23, Robert L. Parker, 49, Lori S. Parker, 42, and Tammy A. Delong, 35, and Delong’s 16-year-old daughter, Katelynn Fancher, died in the crash. Victims: Katelynn Fancher, 16, left, and Diana Wright, 23, right, were both killed in the car crash on Saturday which claimed three other lives. They went for a drive with relatives to 'fly' over four popular large hills, but the joy ride ended tragically . Serious condition: The driver of the car,  Darrell G Delong, 49, right, is the sole survivor of the crash, which killed his wife, Tammy A Delong, 35, left, and his 16-year-old daughter Katelynn . Dead: Robert L. Parker, 49, left, and Lori S. Parker, 42, right, were also killed in the crash . The driver, Darrell G Delong, 49, whose wife and daughter were killed, was the only survivor. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Evansville, Indiana, where he is in serious condition, according to the St Louis Post-despatch. Sam Dorris, 22, who was married to Wright, was with them before they headed out to drive the thrill hills. ‘When they walked out the door, they said, “We’ll be back in a little bit”, and they never came back,’ said Dorris, of McLeansboro. ‘I guess they caught a little too much air going over that last hill and lost control at the bottom.’ The killed family were driving in a Chevrolet Trailblazer at about 10:20 pm on Anderson School Road about a quarter-mile north of County Road 1000 North when the sport utility vehicle rolled several times. 'They never came back': Sam Dorris, 22, the husband of Diana Wright, 23, who was killed in the crash says he will never do the thrill hill drive again, even though he admits he is 'good at it' All but Robert Parker were ejected. He was wearing a seat belt and was trapped in the SUV. Driving on the roughly four-mile stretch of rural paved road for the fun of flying through the air is a common activity in the area, according to police. ‘There are about four hills that are close together, and if you’re driving very fast, it doesn’t take much for a vehicle to go airborne,’ said Hamilton County Chief Deputy Jason Stewart. ‘Everybody does it,’ said Dorris. ‘I’ve done it. I’m good at it. But I won’t do it ever again.’ Ejected from the car: Both Katelynn, left, and Diana, right, were thrown from the vehicle and killed when it rolled over multiple times after the driver, Katelynn's father, Darrell, lost control of the vehicle . Robert and Lori Parker were married, as were Tammy and Darrell Delong. Robert Parker was Darrell Delong’s nephew. Robert Parker had worked as an assistant starter at Fairmount Park racetrack. Wright was a niece of the Delongs and worked at a hog farm, said Dorris, who had been married to her for about three years. Police said hill-jumping on the road had been the cause of several crashes — many involving deer — and that residents have often complained about speeders.","The people were killed, including a 16-year-old girl, after going 'hill-jumping' in their car, a popular pastime for the locals in an area with four large hills in a row .

A state official said Wednesday that he 'can guarantee' some West Virginians are breathing in traces of a carcinogen while showering after the chemical spill, but federal health guidelines say people need to breathe 'a lot of it' to be a problem. The crude MCHM that spilled into the water supply ultimately can break down into formaldehyde, Environmental Quality Board official Scott Simonton told a state legislative panel Wednesday. He added that the breakdown can happen in the shower and that formaldehyde is most toxic when inhaled . But University of Washington public health dean Dr. Howard Frumkin, an environmental health specialist, suggested that officials use caution when interpreting the results of the water tests, including asking whether the chemical's presence existed before the spill. Concern: The vice chairman of the West Virginia Environmental Quality Board told members of the state legislature he¿s a little 'freaked out' about what he¿s found in the water supply following Freedom Industries chemical leak and resulting nine-county water emergency . I'm not drinking it: Scott Simonton, who is also an environmental scientist at Marshall University, told members of a joint legislature committee investigating the chemical leak that he¿s found formaldehyde during testing of the water in downtown Charleston . 'There's lot of possibilities there,' he said, including the chance that formaldehyde showing up in tests . isn't a result of the chemical spill. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the chemical 'can make you feel sick if you breathe a lot of it.' Simonton called respiratory cancer the biggest risk with breathing in the chemical. 'I . can guarantee that citizens in this valley are, at least in some . instances, breathing formaldehyde,' Simonton said. 'They're taking a hot . shower. This stuff is breaking down into formaldehyde in the shower or . in the water system, and they're inhaling it.' Initial testing at Vandalia Grille in Charleston showed traces of the chemical in the water. Other testing showed no traces of formaldehyde, but samples are still being processed. 'The problem is, we're seeing it in water. We don't know what the concentration is in air.' Simonton told reporters Wednesday. 'We do know that there is enough mass of that contaminant to exceed EPA safe levels in air.' Worries: Scott Simonton, who is also an environmental scientist at Marshall University, told members of a joint legislature committee investigating the chemical leak that he¿s found formaldehyde during testing of the water in downtown Charleston . A resident of Charleston, West Virginia set a glass of tap water on fire to show the level of toxicity from a chemical contamination . A Charleston couple conducted a water experiment where they were able to set it on fire following its contamination with 4-methylcyclohexane methanol - which is used to clean coal . The testing is . funded by a Charleston law firm, Thompson Barney LLC, which is also . representing businesses that lost money because they couldn't use water . for days. Freedom Industries' spill in Charleston spurred a water-use ban for 300,000 West Virginians, but officials have lifted it. State . officials believe the leak of crude MCHM and stripped PPH started January 9th. Freedom Industries has estimated 10,000 gallons of chemicals leaked . from its tank. 'We know that . (crude MCHM) turns into other things, and these other things are bad,' Simonton told reporters Wednesday. 'And we haven't been looking for . those other things. So we can't say the water is safe yet. We just . absolutely cannot.' According . to the federal Centers for Disease, Control and Prevention, . formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. It is colorless, strong-smelling gas . used to make building materials and household products, including . walls, cabinets, and furniture. Erin Brockovich, who helped the illness-plagued town of Hinkley, California win $300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she will lend her expertise in West Virginia . Breathing . formaldehyde in large quantities can cause sore throats, coughing, . itchy eyes and nosebleeds. Symptoms also are common with other upper . respiratory illnesses, such as colds, the flu and seasonal allergies. People with short-term exposure are less likely to have symptoms. According . to the CDC, the risk of health problems is low when formaldehyde levels . are of 10 parts per billion. The risk is 'medium' at 100 parts per . billion, particularly among the elderly, young children and for those . with health conditions such as asthma. During the water ban, some people had put plastic bags . around faucets so that they will be reminded not to use the water while . others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant. Water . distribution centers handed out bottled water and trucks with large . tanks of water filled up containers for people to take home. So far, only ten people exposed to . the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in . serious condition, Health and Human Resources Secretary Karen Bowling . said. The chemical, even in . its most concentrated form, isn't deadly. However, people were told they . shouldn't even wash their clothes in affected water, as the compound . can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting . and diarrhea. Other . than schools, day-care centers, hotels and many restaurants were still . closed on Monday, the region was open for business but foot traffic was . slow.","Earlier this month as much as 7,500 gallons of toxic chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol spilled into Elk River, near the state's largest water treatment intake .

The Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Cornwall are known to share beauty secrets - and it seems that they have been passing their tips onto Prince Harry. The young Royal has Elizabeth Arden's Eight Hour Cream in his kit bag for his Walking With The Wounded Allied Challenge expedition to the South Pole. The Prince, who embarked on the challenge this week, was advised to use the cream by Conrad Dickinson, an . experienced polar guide who used it during his . expedition to the North Pole in 2011. Beauty secret: Prince Harry has been using Elizabeth Arden's Eight Hour Cream to keep his skin soft in the Antarctic . The £29 cream was created seventy years ago by Elizabeth Arden as a balm to soothe her horse's bruises and has now become a cult product with one sold every two minutes in the UK, and every thirty seconds globally. It is a blend of petrolatum and vitamin E, which aims to sooth dry skin and lock in moisture in harsh conditions. Benefits: The £29 cream is a blend of petrolatum and vitamin E, which aims to sooth dry skin and lock in moisture in harsh conditions . Prince Harry isn't the only famous fan - Victoria Beckham, Cara Delevingne and Cheryl Cole swear by it too. The 29-year-old Royal will complete the expedition in just under four weeks to raise money for the re-education and retraining of wounded ex-servicemen and women. The 2013 Allied Challenge will see . three teams of wounded soldiers from the UK, USA and Commonwealth race . across 330km in temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius, skiing . up to 20 hours a day. Speaking about the charity expedition, of which Harry is patron, co-founder Ed Parker said: 'It is the most inhospitable conditions on the planet.' Prince Harry, who is one sixth of the UK team, has already been described as the 'dynamo within the team,' by teammate Capt Disney. Elizabeth Arden will be giving £1 for every product sold during the expedition to the charity. Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream is a product I have written about many times over the years and one of the most iconic beauty products in the world, used and loved since the 1930s for its miracle multi-tasking moisturising properties. It can now add to its impressive history as it is be in the kit bags of all three Walking With The Wounded teams - Prince Harry among them - for their expedition race to the South Pole. Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream also comes in lipstick form, Lip Protectant Stick, £20, elizabetharden.co.uk. Keeping your skin and lips protected as the temperature drops is essential - nobody wants chapped, cracked lips or red, sore skin, but in extreme weather, serious protection is required. Many of those walking in the teams have very delicate, damaged skin, especially if they have been burnt. The non-covered areas, particularly the face and their amputee areas take a real battering from all the elements, including wind, UVA and UVB rays and the extreme cold climate. It is critical that they take care to protect their skin as they are at high risk of getting frostbite, which would prevent them from completing the challenge.Conrad Dickinson, an experienced Polar Guide, recommended that the teams take Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Skin Protectant in their expedition kit to the South Pole because he has used it before and found it highly effective in giving the skin extra protection during the challenge to the North Pole in 2011.It was originally created in the 1930s by Miss Elizabeth Arden to soothe her famous thoroughbred horses’ legs. It became very beneficial to her clients, even its name came about thanks to a remarkable performance – a loyal client used it to treat her child’s skinned knee and “eight hours later” the skin was all better. Its effectiveness is attributed to a perfect balance of skin-shielding petrolatum, Vitamin E and soothing, anti-inflammatory beta-hydroxy acid. Its multi-tasking uses protect skin from drying sun, wind and minor skin irritations; it is the essential beauty product for make-up artists, used to highlight eyes and cheeks, all year round Ideal for using after shaving or waxing; great to soften wind-chapped hands and rough, dry cuticle . It is a wonderful antidote for rough heels and soles and is the perfect in-flight moisture boost wherever and whenever skin feels dry.*In addition to supplying the team with their personal products Elizabeth Arden will donate £1 to Walking With the Wounded for every Eight Hour® Cream Skin Protectant, £25 (50ml) sold in the UK during their expedition (1st – 15th December)P.S...Prince Harry will not be the first member of the Royal family to be using Elizabeth Arden products. They have had the Royal warrant for fifty years and his grandmother likes their lipsticks. Most recently HM The Queen has been wearing either Elizabeth Arden Exceptional Lipstick in Fiesta or the new Beautiful colour.

A 14-year-old girl who went missing from her Sydney home earlier this week has been reunited with her emotional parents after she was found safe and well. Krystal Muhieddine's parents Wally and Suzanne had made a desperate plea for information regarding the whereabouts of the teenager after she left her home in Hunters Hill, one of Australia's wealthiest suburbs on Tuesday morning. She had last been seen getting into a silver hatchback with red P-plates driven by a teenage boy that was unknown to her parents. But police found her with a boy in a coffee shop near the Aire River in Victoria today. Safe: Krystal Muhieddine, 14, was found with a teenage boy at a coffee shop in Victoria on Friday . Worried: Krystal's parents, Wally and Suzanne Muhieddine (pictured), had made an emotional plea for her safe return . She hugged her parents as they were reunited later the same day after her parents flew in to Tullamarine Airport. According to Mr Muhieddine, Krystal . and the boy had been camping after the teenager grew 'angry and . frustrated' at home and ran away. He said that he and his wife will talk to Krystal in a bid to negotiate ways in which they can be 'better parents'. He told Fairfax Media: 'We’re going . to approach this from a position of negotiation, see what she would like . and what’s satisfies us. 'Clearly what we’ve been doing hasn’t worked. 'Our heart goes out to parents who don’t get the same good news we received today.' Runaways: The teenager had last been seen getting into a car with an unknown man . Fearing the worst, Mr and Mrs Muhieddine held a press conference earlier this week appealing for help to find their daughter. Mr and Mrs Muhieddine said that their daughter was 'only a baby... she sleeps with her teddy bear'. 'You're not in trouble, no one is in trouble - we just want to know where you are and that you are safe,' Mrs Muhieddine told news.com.au. Friends of Krystal said she had recently spoken about a boy. Her . parents said she might have been communicating with someone online . before she disappeared despite a ban on social media websites in the . family home, but her father was adamant she had never had a boyfriend. 'She's never dated anyone. She's never been anywhere without me dropping her off,' said Mr Muhieddine. Last Friday, Krystal - the second youngest of four daughters - sneaked out of the house to see a movie, telling one of her sisters she had her mother's permission.

A Seattle marijuana grower has started selling a new strain of weed called 'Beast Mode', after the nickname of Seahawks star running back Marshawn Lynch. Nate 'Diggity' Johnson, owner of Queen Anne Cannabis Club where Beast Mode is being sold, says he is getting into the Super Bowl spirit as the city's team prepare to play on Sunday. He told the Seattle Times that the pot was named after Lynch because it's so strong, it hits you like a running back. While most medical-marijuana sold at . Seattle dispensaries have a THC level of 12-20 per cent, Beast Mode has a . THC content of 17.6 per cent making it one of the stronger strains . Washington residents can purchase. Tribute: A Seattle marijuana dispensary has started selling a new strain of pot called Beast Mode after the nickname of Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch . Top of the game: Lynch is the star running back of the Seattle Seahawks, which are due to compete in this weekend's Super Bowl championships against the Denver Broncos . Beast Mode was produced by growers Zion Gardens, who were looking to develop a strain called Girl Scout Cookies. When they tried the product at the end, however, they realized the weed was anything but sweet. Mr Johnson says the effects of the strain start off slow and build before hitting 'like Beast Mode'. Pot peddler: Nate 'Diggity' Johnson is the owner of Queen Anne Cannabis Club where Beast Mode is currently being sold . Superfans: Above, a selection of some of the other Seahawks products on sale at the dispensary. Mr Johnson said the pot-laced Seahawks cupcakes sold out quickly . 'Marshawn has gears when he’s running and it’s kind of like that. It has a little bit of a slow start and then kicks in,' Mr Johnson told the Times. The asking price for Beast Mode is $13 per gram or $150 per half ounce. Washington dispensaries technically aren't allowed to charge for their product. Donations help pay for employees pay and the cost to keep the dispensary running. As far as he knows, this is the only marijuana strain currently on the market named after a Seahawk. While there may not be any other Seattle Seahawks-inspired marijuana strains, dispensaries in Colorado were selling pot named after Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning earlier this year. Colorado was the other state where marijuana became legal this year. Competition: A dispensary in Colorado, where marijuana is also legalized, was selling a strain named after Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning earlier this year . But naming a controlled substance after a football player brings up interesting legal questions. Lynch has trademarked 'Beast Mode' for use on clothing and hats, and has further trademarks pending for sunglasses, headphones, bracelets and cleats. Marijuana manufacturers have been told by legal experts that trademarks will most likely not apply to pot since there is a federal ban on the controlled substance. Mr Johnson believes that since his business runs on donations only, Lynch won't sue for their use of his slogan. When marijuana growers Good Meds started producing and selling lines of Peyton and Eli Manning pot, representatives for the elder Manning brother threatened to sue if they continued to use his name. It's uncertain whether Good Meds has continued to sell both Peyton and Eli Manning strains. Calls to the dispensary were not immediately returned Wednesday morning.

Keeping his options open: Vice President Joe Biden said that he hasn't decided about running for President in 2016 . Vice President Biden hasn't given up on his dream as he said that 'in my heart' he feels that he could be a good president. 'I haven't made a decision to run and I haven't made a decision not to run,' he said in a post-State of the Union interview this morning on The Today Show. 'In the meantime, I've got a job.' He laughed and thanked anchor Savannah Guthrie for not asking outright if he was running, but she rephrased the question, making it more about his feelings. 'In my heart I'm confident I could . make a good President. It's a very different decision to decide whether . or not to run for President, and there's plenty of time for that. In another stop on the morning show circuit, Biden said that he and his wife have not had any final conversations on the issue. 'Jill and I will make that decision later down the road,' he told CBS This Morning. 'If . I do the job well and decide to run for President, it will help, If I . don't the job well and decide to run for President, it won't help and if . I don't run for President we'll be okay.' When asked if Hillary Clinton's decision whether or not to run will play into his, Biden said: 'No not directly.' 'The . only reason a man or woman should run for President- I'm sure Hillary . views it the exact same way- is if they think they're better positioned . to do what the nation needs at the moment.' He echoed that sentiment during his ABC interview on Good Morning America: . 'If I run it won't be who's in the field, it'll be whether or not I . honestly believe I have a chance to be able to really move this country . in a direction that is different from those who are running.' While . Vice Presidents are typically the assumed candidate to lead a party at . the end of a second term, many in the Democratic party see former . Secretary of State Clinton as the likely nominee. Off topic: The majority of the interviews were dedicated to discussing the State of the Union address given last night, but he also touched on former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates' memoir . Obama, Clinton and Biden were all presidential candidates in 2008, and Biden's numbers forced him to drop out more quickly than Clinton, who stayed in till the bitter end against Obama. Though some thought that Clinton would make a good vice president for Obama in order to placate the warring factions of the Democratic party, tensions between the two were still so raw. Additionally, Biden was seen as a way to shore up Obama's international credibility given his time as the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Clinton's four years as the nation's top diplomat helped her check that box in President Obama's first term, and she now faces the challenge of overcoming the expectations allotted to a front-runner. Political analysts also read into the . fact that President Obama decided to sit down for his first televised . interview of the second term with Clinton at his side rather than Biden. In both interviews, which . were done remotely from the library at the Naval Observatory in . Washington, Biden made his first public remarks on former Secretary of . Defense Bob Gates' memoir. Gates . blasted Biden in the book, saying that the vice President had been . wrong on practically every issue throughout his decades in public . office. Next in line? Vice Presidents are typically the assumed successor after two terms, but many believe that Hillary Clinton is the most likely leader of the Democratic party in 2016 . Judged on performance: Biden said that he has a job to do and if he does well, that would help a 2016 bid . Biden made a slip in his first remarks, as he twice called Gates' Bill instead of Bob, opting for the Microsoft billionaire's moniker instead of the Secretary of Defense. 'Look I like Bill Gates, the part I focused on in his book is he said ""Biden's a man of great integrity"". I think he's a man of integrity as well,' Biden said. 'The fundamental problem here is that Bill Gates and I- Bob Gates and I have disagreed on almost every major foreign policy issue since Vietnam.'","The Vice President spoke this morning about the State of the Union but also answered questions about a possible 2016 presidential bid .

Ross, speaking at a news conference to introduce the Dolphins' new general manager, said he spoke with the NFL and Wells to get a sense of what will be included in the report. Suspended: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito (right) was accused of bullying his fellow teammates in the bullying scandal and was suspended from eight games. He said he doubts he will return to the Dolphins . 'I have an idea what will be in it,' Ross said Tuesday. 'I haven't seen the report. I don't know exactly what . his conclusion is. When it comes out, we'll do what has to be done. 'In . my mind, I know what direction we're going. ... The respect that we . gained by how we handled the situation that took place here says a lot . about this organization and the people that are running it.' Wells' report is expected to address the . roles of coaches and staff in the case. One issue is whether anyone on . the coaching staff ordered Incognito to toughen up Martin. The case inspired a national debate about workplace bullying. Incognito, who is white, confirmed that he had left an expletive-ridden message on Martin's voicemail, making racial slurs and saying he wanted to defecate in his teammate's mouth. 'Hey, wassup, you half n***** piece of [expletive],' he said in the message. 'I saw you on Twitter, you been training ten weeks. Martin left the Dolphins after being allegedly harassed by teammate Richie Incognito . '[I want to] [expletive] in your . [expletive] mouth. [I'm going to] slap your [expletive] mouth. [I'm . going to] slap your real mother across the face (laughter). [Expletive] . you, you’re still a rookie. I’ll kill you.' Incognito later said he was embarrassed about the voicemail, but insisted it was not malicious. 'I'm . embarrassed by my actions,' he told Fox Sports. 'I understand why a lot . of eyebrows get raised, but people don’t know how Jon and I communicate . to one another.' Incognito becomes a free agent this winter. When asked if he or the 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin will play for the Dolphins again, Ross equivocated. 'I don't believe so - well, I can't say that,' Ross said, adding with a chuckle, 'Therefore I retract that.' Part of Martin's interview aired on the Nightly News on Tuesday and on Today on Wednesday.

A cross-dressing ex-convict has admitted to strangling and hacking the neck of his neighbor before hiding his mutilated body in his bedroom closet more than a year ago. Aston Martin Barth yesterday pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the brutal December 18, 2012, death of his childhood friend, Jason Campbell. Moments before his trial began, Barth admitted to choking the 35-year-old before using an ax to partially . slice off Campbell's head following an argument. He then wrapped the body in a blanket and . trash bag and stashed it in the cupboard in his Ferndale Boulevard, Long Island home. Before Barth's mother and brother found the victim on Christmas Eve, the killer continued to go to work as a cook in a restaurant and told friends he didn't know what had happened to Campbell. Long Island News Day reported that, in return for the plea, Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Glenn Kurtzrock agreed to recommend the minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison. Barth will be sentenced next month. Campbell's family yesterday welcomed the plea and said they were relieved to avoid a trial. 'Part of it is relief that I don't have to go through the whole thing again,' Norma Campbell, the victim's mother, said. 'I live with it every day...I really would love to know the real . reason he (Barth) did this.' Victim: Barth admitted to killing his long-time friend, 35-year-old Jason Campbell (pictured) during an argument in Barth's Long Island home in December 2012 . In court: Members of Campbell's family, including his partner Latonya Mills (left) and mother Norma Campbell (right), were in court yesterday to hear Barth's plea . Latonya Mills, the mother of Campbell's two children aged three and five months, said she was still devastated. 'Jason was a good guy,' she said. 'He was a good father.' At the time of the murder, Barth was on parole for a notorious 2007 bank robbery. Wearing his mother's brown skirt suit, a blonde wig, sandals and makeup, Barth stole $11,000 from a Citibank branch in Central Islip. He told his father, who drove him to the bank, he was dressed as a woman to participate in a survey. Despite his meticulous disguise, the bank robber forgot to hide his mustache and was nabbed not long after. Scene: Barth has admitted killing his friend and stuffing his body in a closet in Barth's Central Islip home (pictured) on December 18, 2012 . Barth had a prior conviction for an armed robbery, for which he was sentenced to three years behind bars in 2001. Barth's mother, Connie Barth, told Newsday her son had been treated for mental illness since childhood but refused help in recent years. 'I'm so sorry,' she told the newspaper. 'My son needed medication but he wouldn't take it. He would say, 'I can do this' without medication.'

A 300-year-old rare Stradivarius violin was stolen by a robber who used a taser on Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra's concertmaster to force him to drop the valuable instrument. Frank Almond, who had the $6 million violin on indefinite loan from a local family, was leaving a concert at Wisconsin Lutheran College when he was attacked at about 10.30pm on Monday. Police believe Mr Almond was targeted for the Lipinski Stradivarius, which has been owned by a string of prominent musicians since it was first crafted in 1715. Scroll down for video . Loss: Frank Almond, right, had just finished a concert when he was attacked by a robber who stole his violin . Rare: The Lipinski Stradivarius, crafted in 1715, was on permanent loan to the concertmaster . The violin had been previously owned by a string of high-profile musicians, including Devil's Trill composer Giuseppe Tartini, wand Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. The Lipinski Stradivarius was crafted in 1715 by Antonio Stradiveri. An early owner was composer Guiseppe Tartini, who gave it to his student, Salvini. Salvini passed ownership to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. After Lipinski played for him, Salvini is said to have smashed the musician's violin, before handing him the Stradivarius and saying, 'Try this instrument'. After Lipinski's death in 1861 the violin was acquired by Engelbert RÃ¶ntgen, and it stayed with his family for three generations. In the 1940s the violin was sent to Cuba, where it was owned by a supporter of the Havana Symphony. But after fleeing the revolution, the violinist was forced to sell the instrument so he could start a new life in the U.S. It was bought in New York in 1962 by Evi Liivak, an Estonian who played secret concerts to keep spirits raised during the Nazi occupation. In 2008, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra's  Frank Almond was given the violin on permanent loan. Source: A Violin's Life . It had survived the Cuban revolution, during which its sale helped a Havana musician escape to the U.S., and was used in concerts across Europe by a woman who escaped the Nazis. 'The artistic heritage of Milwaukee was assaulted and robbed last night,' Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said. Mr Almond, who studied at the Juilliard academy in New York, was left incapacitated on the sidewalk after being hit by a taser, as the thief fled to a maroon or burgundy minivan that was waiting nearby. The violin's case was found, empty and discarded, near the scene of the attack, according to Fox News. 'This is not something that can be easily sold for even a fraction of its monetary value,' Police Chief Flynn said. Only a few hundred Stradivarius violins, crafted by Antonio Stradiveri, remain in the world, and the FBI and Interpol are helping with the investigation. Mr Almond was offered the use of the violin in 2008, when a family clearing the estate of a dead relative contacted the concertmaster to ask his opinion of an instrument they had found. In an interview with The Violinist last . year, Mr Almond recalled how he had at first been skeptical, saying . that he is regularly contacted by people who believe they have found a . rare instrument. After . meeting the owners, who showed him paperwork and old concert programs, . Mr Almond was led to a bank vault where the precious violin had been . stored for 20 years. 'It . turned out that they had put it in a bank vault - a regular bank vault . at M & I Bank, which happened to be about, I'd say, 100 yards from . the concert hall,' Mr Almond said. Loan: Concertmaster Frank Almond at a performance. The violinist was tasered by an attacker on Monday . Attack: Frank Almond had just performed at a concert in Wisconsin Lutheran College . 'It was ironic - I'd been playing all the time in this hall, and there was a 1715 Strad, down the street in a bank vault.' The violin had an impressive pedigree, and allowed Mr Almond to perform on an instrument once used by 'godfather of modern violin playing' Tartini, and Lipinski. 'If you start thinking about everything behind that instrument, it's easy to feel quite tiny,' Mr Almond said in a previous interview. 'Sure, it was creepy to play the Devil's Trill sonata for the first couple times. But that's what the violin is for: playing. 'It's going to be here a lot longer than I am, and every day that I'm able to play on it, to me, it's amazing.' Craftsman: An illustration of Antonio Stradivari, who made the missing violin in 1715 . Origins: The violin's early owners included Giuseppe Tartini, left, and Karol Lipinski, right . Generations of music: The violin was also owned by Engelbert Rontgen, left, and Evi Liivak, right . Well traveled: Frank Almond waits to board a plane with the rare violin in 2009 . Its last owner had been a child prodigy from Estonia, whose music studies in Budapest were cut short when her father was killed by the Gestapo. Evi Liivak was known for playing secret concerts in bunkers to raise the spirits of those living under Nazi oppression. She took possession of the violin in New York in 1962, when her husband, a Milwaukee pianist, bought it for $19,000 from a Cuban who was forced to sell it after escaping Havana. Its enticing history led Mr Almond to record A Violin's Life in tribute to it. The CD features him playing pieces that had been composed or were associated with its various owners in the past 300 years. Although the violin needs to be played regularly to keep it in good condition, the aged instrument must also be kept in a temperature-controlled environment to preserve it.","Frank Almond was leaving a concert when he was attacked .

The Fort Worth, Texas Democrat received claims on social media saying she left her daughters behind on her climb to the top and that she 'lost custody of them' after divorcing her husband Jeff Davis. Daughters Amber Davis, 31, and Dru Davis, 25, can only say wonderful things about the woman they say was 'remarkable.' Wendy Davis stands wither her vehemently supportive daughters Dru (left) and Amber (center right) and boyfriend and former mayor of Austin, Will Wynn . How could they say that? Davis is appalled over the rumors circulating about her on social media . Dru Davis spoke passionately in her open letter, reports the Austin American Statesman. 'I hate that I feel the need to write this, but I have been reading and hearing so many untrue things about my mom and I want to set the record straight,'said Davis. 'And sadly I feel the need to be crystal clear on the malicious and false charge of abandonment as nothing could be further from the truth. My mom has always shared equally in the care and custody of my sister and me.' Amber also addressed the libelous social media claims saying that her mother wasn't up to par. 'I have spent the past few days reading the ludicrous comments that people have shared on social media about my mother and our family. It is a shame that those who don’t know us feel the need to comment on the details of our lives as if they’ve lived them. I have a hard time understanding how such hate and negativity can result from one person’s false accusations.' Both Davis' daughters stand by their mother's story that she grew up in a Fort Worth Trailer Park and that she fought her way to becoming a student at Harvard Law.

In addressing the issue of how long her mother lived on a trailer she said, 'My mother had me when she was very young, a kid herself. And although she was married for a short period of time, parenthood was her sole responsibility. Yes, we lived in a trailer. Does it matter how long? Not to me.' Dru Davis had firmly stood by her mother and says that she was always a good parent, even though she took time to further her career after they were born. 'Yes, she went to law school after my sister and I were born. We lived with her the first semester, but I had severe asthma and the weather there wasn’t good for me. My parents made a decision for my sister and me to stay in Texas while my mom kept going to school. But that doesn’t mean she wasn’t there for us.' Davis believes that Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (pictured) is to blame for the libelous rumors . Dru says that her mother always had custody of them following the divorce and that the custody was shared equally between parents. The letters from her daughters came right before Davis went on Fusion television with Jorge Ramos on Monday. 'Those allegations are really absurd, Jorge,' she said. 'My life story is my life story. I am a young woman who had lived in poverty for many years before I was able to work and lift myself out of that place, and I know that there are Texans across the state that are facing the same challenges that I once faced.'

A convicted murderer who was released after 10 years in prison will spend the rest of his life behind bars after he was found guilty again for murdering a teenager and dumping her body in a shallow grave. Christopher Alexander Falconer killed Amber Kirwan, 19, who was last seen alive after leaving Dooly's pool hall in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, on October 9, 2011. Her remains were found a month later in a shallow grave in Heathbell, Pictou County. Supreme Court Judge Nick Scaravelli sentenced Falconer, 31, to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. The jury spent seven and a half hours deliberating before reaching a verdict. Miss Kirwan's mother, Marjorie Kirwan, wept as the sentence was read out. According to CBC News, crown attorney Bill Gorman said the Kirwan family will never recover from the death of Amber. Speaking after the case he said: 'Their sense of relief, I believe was palpable, this tragedy that I don't think they'll ever get past. 'Justice was done. The jury carefully and thoughtfully considered. They would have deliberated for the better part of a day and they got our message and they made their finding'. Miss Kirwan's body and clothes were found in a shallow grave close to the home of Falconer's stepsister. A bloody tank top with both Miss Kirwan and Falconer's DNA was found in his car. According to a medical examiner, Miss Kirwan was stabbed at least 10 times - mostly on her neck, upper back and through the heart. The court heard there was evidence to suggest Miss Kirwan put up a fight against her attacker despite having high levels of codeine in her body. Justice: Christopher Falconer arriving at Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Pictou, Canada, where he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Amber Kirwan . Falconer's defence lawyer Mike Taylor said he was not surprised by the verdict and that at this time his client did not intend to appeal. Falconer pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1998 and was sentenced to life in prison. He and another teenager killed taxi driver Robert Leblanc before joyriding in his cab. The murder took place on Heathbell Road - the same road where Miss Kirwan's body was found. However, Falconer was released after serving more than 10 years for the murder of Mr Leblanc.

Cantore was broadcasting from the snow-covered College of Charleston in South Carolina on Tuesday night when he spotted his assailant running at him from out of the corner of his eye. The student - emitting a convincing battle cry - ran towards Cantore, 49, and tried to jump on him, but was instead met with the force of Cantore's knee in his crotch. See below for video .

Cantore stayed remarkably cool throughout the incident and continued talking as he shrugged off his attacker. The student could do nothing but run away - this time silently.

A New Mexico woman is accused of calling 9-1-1 to report that she saw a man with a gun walking into a convenience store on Sunday in a feeble attempt to get the police officer who had just pulled over she and her friends to turn his attention from them to the supposed gunman. Unfortunately for 22-year-old Savana Jimenez, her plan backfired and she was arrested before the officers bothered to check on her bogus report. According to authorities in Roswell, Jimenez and two friends were stopped Sunday morning for an unknown traffic violation. 9-1-1: Savana Jimenez is accused of falsely reporting that a man with a gun was walking into a convenience store . When the three were pulled over, the officer who made the stop noticed that the woman in the passenger seat - Jimenez - was fiddling with her phone as the officer was checking out the information of the driver. 'The officer noticed that these three females in the vehicle were . fidgety, acting kind of nervous and he saw one of them with a cellphone . on her lap, Roswell Police Public Information Liaison Sabrina .

Even though he seems to have found love in the arms of model Chantel Jeffries, Justin Bieber won't be having a sweet Valentine's Day this year. MailOnline has learned exclusively the Baby singer is scheduled to be arraigned on that very holiday for his Thursday arrest in Miami, Florida that included a DUI, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. Meanwhile, the 19-year-old has been looking like he doesn't have a care in the world as he frolicks on a beach in Panama with his entourage. Scroll down for video . Life in the fast lane: Justin Bieber, seen here on Monday in Panama, will be arraigned for his DUI in Miami on Valentine's Day . 'Justin will be arraigned on February 14 at 9 am,' a source told MailOnline exclusively. 'He will have to meet with judge William Altfield. There is already a courtroom assigned to his case.' Justin already has an attorney, Roy Black, working on his behalf. Not facing reality: Instead of dealing with his management team, the 19-year-old has been hanging out with his party crew while on vacation . 'Justin doesn't have to be there,' Ed Griffith, a Miami state attorney's office spokesman, told People. 'He will plead non guilty and the process will begin.' The Beauty And A Beat singer was arrested in the early morning hours of Thursday in the Miami Beach area after visiting the club SET with his father Jeremy, 38, rapper Khalil Sharief and model Chantel, aged 21. Police noticed Bieber when a street had been closed off for him by friends to make room for a drag race with Khalil. The star was pulled over in his rented yellow Lamborghini and dropped several F-bombs after being asked to get out of his car and put his hands on his vehicle. In trouble: It was not even a week ago when the Baby singer had his mug shot taken and was released on $2,500 bail . The police officer had noted in his report that he smelled alcohol coming from the performer. That has now been the subject of a new debate, according to TMZ, because the singer admitted he had only one beer and the BAC level he was tested at came back at only .014, not the original .04 he was believed to have blown. Either way, the officer did note that Bieber was not fit to drive. The star did admit to smoking marijuana and taking prescription pills, which could have hindered his ability to operate a vehicle. His friend Khalil had a zero BAC level but was still arrested for a DUI, according to a Monday report from TMZ. But the Def Jam rapper could have been under the influence of something else such as marijuana or pills, the site notes. Musician Jermaine Dupri told TMZ on Tuesday he was also pulled over by Miami police in December after he left a club. The star explained this happens because 'nine times outta 10 they gonna find something' and suggested Bieber was too flashy on Thursday in his expensive sports car, calling unnecessary attention to himself. His ladies: Chantel Jeffries (left) has been with the star in Panama while his ex Selena Gomez (right), seen here with Bieber in 2011, has been shut out . Having his arraignment fall on Valentine's Day might be uncomfortable for the singer, who will no doubt be feeling a storm of emotions on the romantic holiday. In early January he was seen with his on-again, off-again love interest of two years Selena Gomez. He has since been spotted with Chantel, who Page Six reported on Monday was hoping to sell her story to outlets such as Good Morning American and Inside Edition about the night of Bieber's arrest. The model was looking to get five figures for her exclusive, but she bowed out of any negotiations after Justin whisked her off to Panama. 'She hired an attorney and was negotiating a deal with the weekly magazines and the big TV shows,' a source told the site. 'She wanted $20,000 plus a guaranteed mention of her modeling career.' Adding to his drama, MailOnline has reported the management team of the Believe star is interested in an intervention and sending him to rehab. His manager Scooter Braun is especially keen to get the star help. What a mess: Bieber and Jeffries in the rented Lamborghini just before his arrest on Thursday in Miami . On Tuesday RadarOnline reported Lucian Grainge, the CEO of Universal Music Group, Bieber's label, said during a Grammy party that the performer 'needs an intervention' soon. 'I’m very concerned about him - I’ve been concerned about him for many months, and [Bieber's manager] Scooter, who I work with very closely... is with him at the moment,' Grainge said. 'Hopefully, we will all get through to him.... All of us around him need to take all the responsibility, all the pressure off him and give him support so he can address the issues he has - and he does have issues. And I’d like it to be dealt with.' The All That Matters singer reportedly was confronted by Braun, his mother Pattie Mallette and mentor Usher while in Panama. Bieber may have bigger problems than his public image. On Tuesday CNN reported his DUI could lead to deportation back to Canada. There is already a petition on We The People to have the White House kick the star out of the US. As of Monday there were 40,000 signatures. Concerned: The Never Say Never singer with manager Scooter Braun, who MailOnline has learned wants his client to go to rehab, in 2012 . Also on Tuesday, R&B singer Brian McKnight, aged 44, told BANG Showbiz he believes Justin's wild antics are part of a plan to get people even more interested in his music. The My Kind of Girl singer - who has worked with top music stars such as Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, Nelly and Christina Aguilera - said: 'I think that the mere fact that everyone is talking about Justin, and Miley Cyrus, now shows that they know exactly what they're doing.' He added: 'In this day and age there really isn't bad publicity, no matter what has happened. With what's happened with Justin these past few weeks he's probably got a new record that's about to come out, I would almost bet my life.' UsWeekly reported on Tuesday the MTV favorite was filming a music video in Panama, most likely for his new song Confident. In photos, he can be seen singing and gesturing while a camera man recorded his moves. Bieber promised to release a new video this week. 'He's got to do something to drum up interest in him so if that means going and getting arrested, or egging his neighbour's house he does whatever it takes,' added Brian. Police visited the Canadian's home in January to investigate an alleged egging of a neighbor's house in his Calabasas gated community called the Oaks, which resulted in the arrest of the star's friend Lil Za. On Monday Detective David Thompson of the Los Angeles Police Department told the New York Daily News he was still going to present a case to prosecutors even though no evidence has been unearthed in the felony vandalism case where $20,000 worth of damage was caused. Is it all for more fame?: Brian McKnight, seen here with Christina Aguilera in 2000, thinks Bieber is getting into trouble to bolster his bad-boy image . Although Brian thinks Justin's behavior will work for him while he's young, he isn't sure if he can continue it when he reaches his 30s. 'At the end of the day, at least he's got the talent to back up his shenanigans, so I think it's a good formula for him,' McKnight added, . 'With the exception of One Direction, he doesn't really have any competition, he's the only game in town. 'My only question is, ""What do you do next?"" If you're always trying to top yourself, and it's not musically topping yourself, what do you do at 30? Well he'd probably say, ""I'll be so rich at that point it won't matter,""' McKnight said.","Justin will be arraigned in Miami, Florida on Valentine's Day by judge William Altfield .

As Cincinnati Zoo keepers laid out her birthday cake . this week, it was the gorilla's surrogate mom, M'Linzi, that led the . still small Gladys to her treat. Scroll down for video . First birthday: Gladys sticks close to her surrogate mother M'Linzi as she tucks into her cake . Growing up: Gladys is learning to live with other gorillas after being hand reared . Adorable . footage showed the tiny creature tentatively chewing on a piece of . fruit before leaning in to grab a huge mouthful of cake, smearing its . puree frosting across her face. Seeing Gladys enjoy her cake in the company of other gorillas was a proud moment for the Cincinnati keepers, who had acted as surrogates to her for five months. When she was transferred to the zoo at the age of four weeks, after being rejected by her mother, staff worked in shifts to provide round-the-clock care. As well as tending to her basic feeding and cleaning needs, keepers had to teach Gladys how to be a gorilla. They . wore specially made furry vests, walked on their hands and knees while . the baby gorilla clung to them, and tried to teach her the low grunting . sounds made by her species. At . five months old, Gladys was ready to be introduced to the zoo's main . gorilla group, and she was paired up with 31-year-old M'Linzi.

To many of us, broken household items are just junk, but to one designer this trash can be transformed into delicate robotic sculptures. Inspired by images from science fiction films, California photographer Larry Wong has designed a range of futuristic miniature droids called Mechanoids. From insects to drones, his electronic figures are all compiled from a collection of broken, everyday items. Inspired by images from science fiction films, California photographer Larry Wong has designed a range of robotic sculptures called Mechanoids. Each of his electronic figures is made up of old household, everyday electrical items. This humanoid features a motor for a head, and parts of a hard drive for arms . Many of Wong's designs were based on the work of Swiss artist and set designer H.R. Giger. Giger was part of the special effects team that won an award for the design of the 1979 science fiction film Alien. He is famous for artwork that represents the human body and machines in a 'cold interconnected relatonship'. Giger calls this relationship 'biomechanical'. These include parts taken from broken VCRs, DVD drives, hard drives, power supplies and plugs and vacuum tubes. Each Mechanoid is then fitted together using copper, steel and aluminum wires. Wong also uses everyday tools, such as pliers and screwdrivers, to build his creatures. The 38-year-old graphic designer and photographer from Pomona, California said his designs developed out of a fascination for electronics. 'I take junk that would otherwise go into a landfill . and turn it into art,' explained Wong. â€˜Looking at [the electronic] parts, I could see that some could possibly be an arm, leg or head for a robot. As well as humanoids, photographer Larry Wong, 38, also makes robotic sculptures designed to look like insects, like the one pictured. He said the intricate parts of many electronic items resemble the delicate arms and legs of spiders and other creatures . This robotic sculpture was designed to look like a drone. It's base is made from a disc drive, while the arms are attached with fuses and copper wire . Wong said his designs developed out of a fascination for electronics. Each sculpture takes up to six hours to complete, and the designer said the most time-consuming job is finding the right part for each leg, head or body from this tool kit, pictured . 'After making my first robot, I was pleased with the way it turned out, so I continued making more.' Wong's Mechanoids range from between four and six inches in size, and because of this minature design, Wong admitted the construction can be fiddly and time-consuming. Complicated humanoids, or more detailed creatures, can take up to six hours to complete, for example. Yet the most time-consuming job is finding the right part for each leg, head or body. The wings of the robotic insect, left, were made from wire bent into shape. The body is made using part of a laser drive, taken from a broken DVD or hard drive. Wong gets other parts from broken VCRs, power supplies and plugs, and vacuum tubes. The simple octopus design, right, is made from a light casing and motor . 'I reject parts if I don't like their shape, colour, material or how it would look on the robot. 'Proportion is very important to me; every part needs to be just the right shape and size. 'Some people don't understand what they're looking at while others wonder about its functionality, whether it does anything. 'Techies particularly enjoy this, I ask them to see how many parts they recognise and figure out where the parts came from.' Each Mechanoid, including this sculpture that looks like an anglerfish, is between four and six inches in size, and because of this miniature design, Wong said the construction can be fiddly and time-consuming . Wong said that proportion is key when designing Mechanoids, especially the more complex humanoid designs pictured. He added that he will regularly reject parts if they're the wrong shape, colour or size . Many of Wong's designs, including these fly-shaped sculptures pictured, were based on the work of Swiss artist and set designer H.R. Giger.

More than 100 members of  the family of the executed uncle of Kim Jong-Un have been killed or arrested, a report claims. A news website for North Korean defectors, Daily NK, reported that members of Jang Song-Thaek's family were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest and subsequent death in December. Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren have been condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Executed: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, right, is said to have ordered that all relatives of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek, left, were put to death following his order to execute his uncle last month . Although South Korean news agencies have . published unconfirmed information from North Korea in the past, the . report from Daily NK back up the claims of a 'purge' of Jang's family. Jang, 67, was executed last month, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime. The president of South Korea, Park Geun-Hye, has previously spoken of her fear of purges among the powerful in the North. 'North Korea is now engaged in a reign of terror while carrying out a massive purge to consolidate the power of Kim Jong-Un,' she told a cabinet meeting. Sources told the Yonhap News Agency . it is unclear exactly when the family members were killed, but they are . believed to have been put to death after Jang's execution on December . 12. Since Kim Jong-Un came to power in April 2012 he has shown himself to be a brutal tyrant, having executed or demoted a long list of people he has deemed a threat. According to newspaper Chosun Ilbo, Ri Yong-ho, Kim Yong-chun, U Tong-chuk, and Kim Jong-gak, all part of his father Kim Jong-il's inner circle, were handpicked to groom the 31-year-old leader, but have since disappeared or been demoted. As well as his uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, other high-ranking members of the military have been purged, including three defence ministers and three chiefs of the army's general staff. Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him. In August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra — which included his ex-girlfriend — were reportedly publicly machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming themselves naked. There are said to have been between 40 to 80 public mass executions in North Korea in 2013. 'Some relatives were . shot to death by pistol in front of other people if they resisted while . being dragged out of their apartment homes,' a source told Yonhap. Among . those allegedly executed were Jang's sister Jang Kye-Sun, her husband . and Ambassador to Cuba Jon Yong-Jin and Jang's nephew and Ambassador to . Malaysia Jang Yong-Chol, as well as his two sons. The children and grandchildren of Jang's two brothers are also said to have been killed. One source told the news agency, which is publicly funded and has close links to the South Korean government: 'All relatives of Jang have been put to death, including even children.' Another source said: 'The executions of Jang's relatives mean that no traces of him should be left. 'The purge of the Jang Song-thaek people is under way on an extensive scale from relatives and low-level officials.' The family were recalled to the Pyongyang area of the country by Ministry of State Security troops in early December before being killed, sources said. It has been reported some relatives were shot to death in front of other people if they resisted as they were dragged from their homes. Some relatives by marriage, including the wife of the Malaysian ambassador, are said to have been spared from execution, and instead have been sent to remote villages with their families, sources have said. Plot: Kim Jong-Un, left, gave orders for his uncle Jang, right, to be executed after he was alleged to have plotted to overthrow the communist regime. South Korean media have reported Jang's children, brothers and grandchildren have now been condemned to death by the North Korean leader . Yonhap's report has yet to be corroborated but in North Korea a culture of 'guilt by association' has prevailed for years with family members of those convicted of crimes facing severe punishment, even death, for decades. Kim Jong-Un's former mentor Jang was accused of a number of crimes against the state. They included plotting a coup, misappropriating resources, womanising, abusing his position of power and 'dreaming different dreams' to the regime. North Korea stunned the world by announcing the execution of the man once seen as the dictator's political regent. His death marks the biggest political upheaval since the 30-year-old inherited power. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated country for more than six decades. Jang is the husband of Jong-un's biological aunt, the sister of his father Kim Jong-Il.","Children, brothers and grandchildren of Jang Song-Thaek said to be dead .

It was the second medical emergency at the restaurant which glorifies unhealthy eating and offers free meals to people over 350 pounds. Its menu includes items such as flatliner fries and butterfat shakes. Meals on wheels: A woman was stretchered out of the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas after complaining of chest pains . A man was taken to hospital in mid-February after he suffered a heart attack while eating a Triple Bypass Burger. The unidentified woman, believed to be in her forties, had been enjoying a meal at the restaurant on Saturday night. Owner of the Heart Attack Grill Jon Basso said the woman was eating fast food, drinking alcohol and smoking before falling onto the floor unconscious. He added that he believed the woman would make a full recovery after the dramatic episode and was being look after in hospital. Supersized: Meals of bypass burgers and flatliner fries at the Heart Attack Grill can exceed 8,000 calories - the average person needs around 2,000 a day . The restaurant chain - founded in 2005 using the catchphrase 'Taste Worth Dying For!' - is run by a former nutritionist 'Doctor' Jon Basso who, remarkably, used to run a Jenny Craig weight loss diet centre.

The 63-year-old was spotted at the weekend with a 25-year-old called Anna in the industrial town of Sumy – 1,700 miles from his home in Hartlepool. He met the mini-skirted blonde through a foreign brides website for women seeking a rich husband. Trip: John Darwin, left, who was jailed for orchestrating a life insurance scam with his wife Anne, right, has been seen on a dinner date with a 25-year-old woman in Ukraine . Darwin was jailed for six years and . three months in 2008 for fraudulently claiming £500,000 in insurance . money with his then wife Anne. He . was declared dead in 2003 – a year after apparently drowning on a canoe . trip. Yet he was living in a hidden part of the pair’s home before they . moved to Panama in 2007. The swindle deceived the police, a coroner, a number of financial institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony. Under . the terms of his early release on licence from prison in 2011, Darwin . was not allowed to leave the UK without Probation Service permission. Last . night the Ministry of Justice advised that offenders who breach the . terms of their licence in this way will be returned to prison to serve . the rest of their sentence. One Probation Service source in the North East added: ‘I do not know what he was thinking by flying off to Ukraine. Journey: Darwin travelled 1,700 miles from Britain to Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine for his date. He was last night thought to be in Kiev . ‘There is an arrogance about Mr Darwin – he must have thought he could get away with it but he is very wrong about that.’ Officially . the Probation Service refused to discuss individual cases but a . spokesman said: ‘Any offender subject to licence supervision is required . to gain permission from probation to travel outside of the UK; . permission is only granted in exceptional circumstances. ‘Any offender who travels without this permission will be subject to recall to custody. ‘In these circumstances the Probation Service works closely with the police to implement the recall.’ Last night Darwin was thought to be staying in the Ukrainian capital Kiev and considering his next move. The . Daily Mail has learned he flew to Ukraine last Thursday before boarding . a sleeper train for the town of Sumy in the north east of the country. According . to one newspaper, Darwin met his statuesque date at his hotel on . Saturday before a two-hour meal along with another woman who . interpreted. When confronted by a reporter he said he had a migraine. Told . that it was likely the authorities would be in touch on his return, he . replied: ‘Well, I’ll have an even bigger headache then.’ Darwin admitted . fraud five years ago in court and received a slightly shorter sentence . than Anne, who denied the offences. Canoe: Darwin's boat was recovered from the sea in March 2002 but there was no trace of him for five years . Home: The house in Hartlepool where the Darwins lived before moving to Panama . In December 2007, he walked into a London police station claiming he had amnesia and was reunited with his stunned sons. Darwin now lives in a £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, and survives on a pension of £138 a week. It . was also unclear last night which travel documents he used to visit . Ukraine as it was thought his passport was not due to be returned to him . until March. The family of .

The clouds have a complex structure and temperatures exceeding 1000°C. As the object rotates, bright and dark clouds move in and out of view and alter its brightness.

It is hoped the findings published in Nature will lead to similar observations on giant planets in distant star systems. The weather outlook on Luhman 16B is bleak.

Dr Ian Crossfield, of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, said: 'Previous observations have inferred brown dwarfs have mottled surfaces but now we can start to directly map them. 'What we see is presumably patchy cloud cover - somewhat like we see on Jupiter.' The maps correspond to very rough versions of satellite weather maps of our own planet. Dr Crossfield said: 'In future we will be able to watch cloud patterns form, evolve and dissipate - eventually maybe exo-meteorologists will be able to predict whether a visit to Luhman 16B can expect clear or cloudy skies.' In a second study Dr Beth Biller, formerly at Max Planck and now at Edinburgh University, reconstructed what happens in different layers of the atmosphere on the brown dwarfs. 'We’ve learned the weather patterns are quite complex. The cloud structure varies quite strongly as a function of atmospheric depth and cannot be explained with a single layer of clouds,' she said. 'The exciting bit is this is only the start. With the next generations of telescopes and in particular the 39 m European Extremely Large Telescope we will likely see surface maps of more distant brown dwarfs - and eventually a surface map for a young giant planet.'

Evidence of extraterrestrial clouds covering two of the most common types of planets in our galaxy have been discovered by the Hubble telescope earlier this month. The atmospheres were discovered by two separate teams of scientists who were analysing the climate of planets GJ 436b and GJ 1214b. The researchers claim their work is an important milestone in characterising potentially habitable, Earth-like worlds beyond the solar system. GJ 436b is categorised as a 'warm Neptune' because it is much closer to its star than frigid Neptune is to our sun. The planet is located 36 light-years away in the constellation Leo. GJ 1214b, meanwhile, is known as a 'super-Earth' type planet. Super-Earths have masses between that of Earth and Neptune. 'Both planets are telling us something about the diversity of planet types that occur outside of our own solar system; in this case we are discovering we may not know them as well as we thought,' said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology. The planets can be observed passing in front of, or transiting, their parent stars. This provides an opportunity to study these planets in more detail as starlight filters through their atmospheres.","Scientists looked at brown dwarf Luhman 16B which is 6.5 light years away .

In her imperious way, she has always been keen to stress her blue-blooded lineage. So it should come as no surprise that Princess Michael of Kent has drawn up a list of socially acceptable wives for her husband should she die before him. The Austrian aristocrat, whose demeanour earned her the nickname Princess Pushy, has told Prince Michael of Kent that there are only three women worthy of succeeding her. She tells Tatler magazine: ‘I said, “If I died, these are three people I’d like you to look at marrying because I think they’d be good for you.” I’m sorry, I’m very European about these things. Englishwomen don’t talk like this, I know.’ The 68-year-old adds: ‘I also said, “If you died first, I have to think about whether I’d stay here or go back to Austria.” I’m allowed to stay here – if I pay the rent!’ In an unintentionally hilarious interview to be published next week, Princess Michael of Kent offers the society bible a deliciously indiscreet insight into life at the heart of the Royal Family. She and Prince Michael, 71, the Queen’s first cousin, live in a former grace-and-favour apartment at Kensington Palace. Neighbours there are Prince William and his wife Kate, who recently moved into a four-storey, 20-room home that once belonged to Princess Margaret. Although there was talk of William taking his mother’s former apartment next to her own, Princess Michael says she always thought Kate would get ‘the wobblies’ living there amid so many memories of Diana. She also reveals that Prince Harry has his eye on the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester’s house at the palace. Of the Cambridges’ new apartment she says: ‘Right where Princess Margaret was! And you know, I was very much behind that. Because it’s the nicest apartment. The intelligence of the courtiers! Distinguished: The regal pair attend a memorial service . ‘When Princess Margaret died, they gave it to the museum [the apartment was handed to Historic Royal Palaces for display and office space]. 'And, obviously, the boy was going to marry one day. He’d need the best apartment, surely. A lovely big garden, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave... they’re rattling around this huge space. ‘And I think Prince Harry might go there, then they’d be next door to each other – very good move. And also, I thought she [Kate] would get the wobblies if she moved next door [into Diana’s former flat]. 'You know, with [the ghost of] Diana. And I might lose my garden! Anyway, that apartment, it’s not the best. Whereas Princess Margaret’s – wonderful. Huge private garden, you know. And then they could open up into the garden next door. I’m sure Prince Harry wouldn’t mind. It would work wonderfully.’ Princess Michael, born Marie-Christine von Reibnitz in the Bohemian spa city of Carlsbad, takes great pains to spell out her impressive ancestry, which according to her includes at least two kings and dozens of dukes. ‘I have great lineage. As you know,’ she says. ‘Even Catherine de Medici and Diana de Poitiers [the first a French queen and mother of three French kings, the second the mistress of Henry II of France], I descend from them both. 'And sometimes people say, “Oh well, we all descend from Adam and Eve.” But do you descend from Charlemagne directly? Do you descend from Saint King Louis IX? I do.’ She reveals that her 1978 marriage was ‘arranged’ by Prince Charles’s great uncle, Lord Mountbatten, after she met Prince Michael at a party in the early 1970s. Romance blossomed only when he pushed them together. ‘I realised afterwards that Mountbatten thought I’d be good for my husband,’ she says. ‘He was our Cyrano de Bergerac.’ The issue of money clearly rankles. The Kents have never received taxpayer funding but when they married they were given their elegant five-bedroom apartment by the Queen for a peppercorn rent. Since 2010, the couple have had to pay £120,000 a year in rent. Princess Michael – who once joked that she would ‘go anywhere for a hot meal’ – has become a speaker on the lecture circuit, dabbles in interior design and has taken on several well-paid consultancies. She trills that she has done ‘a little bit of decorating in Russia – consultancy. I’ve got five jobs now. Pay the rent!’ She is also a writer. The Tatler interview was granted to publicise her first novel The Queen Of Four Kingdoms, set – unsurprisingly – in the court of 15th century France. Princess Michael, who says ‘I’m not into fashion, I’m into glamour’, insinuates that she has been given a ‘rough ride’ as a royal but adds: ‘Look, I was taught, and I taught my children, if they ever came back from school saying “Oh, so and so’s father’s got a helicopter, it’s not fair”, I’d say, “Fair? Whoever said life had to be fair? Is it fair that you live in Kensington Palace? That you’ve each got a pony? There are an awful lot of kids without a pony, you know. Life is not meant to be fair.” ‘You’re dealt the cards and you make the best of them. I’ve never worried about that. I’m a survivor.’She agrees, however, that there is at least one upside to being an HRH: ‘Wimbledon! Three days!’ Princess Michael of Kent’s interview is in the January issue of Tatler, on sale from Monday.

A leaked version of the Oakland Raiders’ cheerleading squad handbook has been labeled as ‘unbelievably sexist’ and ‘illegal’. Excerpts from the secret etiquette handbook were obtained and published by The Los Angeles Times, many of which outline how ‘Raiderettes’ must behave while eating in public and socializing with team players. Criticized for being more concerned with the Raiderette’s reputations than their safety, the handbook outlines rules for fraternizing with advice on how to avoid getting caught in a ‘date rape’ scandal – rather than how to avoid the assault itself. Strict code: A handbook provided to the Oakland Raiders' 'Raiderette' cheerleading squad has been leaked, and subsequently called-out for its 'unbelievably sexist' rules . In . excerpts published by the paper, the squad handbook’s dating advice . reads: ‘There have been a few relationships between the two groups that . have resulted in a few happy marriages and lovely children. HOWEVER, we . have also had more situations where, quite frankly, the Raider . organization and the Raiderettes narrowly escaped ruined reputations.’ It . continues: ‘One such example concerns a player who gave Halloween . parties every year and many of the Raiderettes attended. This same . player was suspended from the team for drug use but also arrested for . date rape. For you on the squad who have attended those parties, just . think how narrowly you missed having your photo in all the local papers . and/or being assaulted.’ Of . this, feminist-geared website Jezebel commented: ‘The [handbook’s] . advice within is so obvious and condescending that it would really only . be appropriate when attempting to advise an alien from outer space on . how to act human.’ Salon.com has a similar outlook, and has labelled the etiquette guide as ‘unbelievably sexist’. According . to the Los Angeles Times, the Raiders are one of the few NFL teams that . allows dating among cheerleaders and players. But they do strongly . discourage it, even threatening in the guide: ‘Some teams who previously . had cheerleaders do not now have them (Chicago Bears). Because of . morality problems with their squads, they decided cheerleaders were too . much trouble to deal with.’ 'The handbook’s advice is so . obvious and condescending that it would really only be appropriate when . attempting to advise an alien from outer space' It . also includes lines like, ‘There’s not a female alive (or male either) who doesn’t like attention. But you need to learn to deal with attention . you receive from the public (and especially the players) without it . getting out of hand and going to your head.’ The . handbook advises the cheerleaders to find out if players are married . before becoming their friends, saying that many will 'lie' about their . marital status and that it is the Raiderette's job to find out the . truth. Appearance is also one of the handbook's main topics. Cheerleaders . are told to always be ready to make a lasting first impression by . maintaining their appearance – a stipulation that includes a perfect . manicure. Raiderettes are instructed to keep nail polish remover pads in their cars in case of emergency. Aside . from cheering at home games, Raiderettes are expected to make multiple . personal appearances each season – some of which may involve eating an . unsavory meal. In these . cases the squad is advised: ‘If you don’t like your meal, try a little . of everything and strategically move the rest around your plate.’ War of wages: A rookie cheerleader known as 'Lacy T' has filed a suit against the team on her squad's behalf, claiming that its cheerleaders are paid less than $5 per hour . Outlines . for Raiderette salaries are also included in the guide, requiring . cheerleaders to sign a contract that, according to squad members, makes . them accept a wage that does not meet government-regulated hourly . minimums -  a payment that prompted a rookie Raiderette known as ‘Lacy . T’ to file a lawsuit against the team’s  owners last week on the squad’s . behalf. 'Just think how narrowly you missed having your photo in all the local papers and/or being assaulted' According to . the suit, Raiderettes are paid less than the government minimum. Dancers . must attend practice three times per week, cheer at ten seasonal home . games, conduct multiple personal appearances, and travel for special . photo shoots. They are only paid for their appearances at games, at $125 per match – adding up to a total of $1,250 in seasonal earnings. When . taking all of the unpaid practices, appearances, and additional time . into account, Lacy T has estimated that she and her squad members are . paid less than $5 an hour. Her legal counsel has pointed out that it against the law to make dancers sign an already-illegal contract. It is also unlawful to only pay the dancers at the end of the season, rather than in incremental amounts. The Oakland Raiders will not provide comment on the lawsuit or the leak of its Raiderette handbook.","The 'etiquette guide' was leaked amid a lawsuit filed by cheerleaders last week .

Ukrainian blonde: Mother-of-one Anna Avramenko, 25, who canoe conman John Darwin met up with on Saturday night . This is the Ukrainian mail order bride that Canoe conman John Darwin fled Britain to meet up with - despite not having permission to leave the country. Blonde-haired Anna is 38 years younger than the convicted fraudster who faces being thrown back in prison when he returns home. Darwin, 63, is believed to have found the young woman on a website called Russiancupid.com and paid a £2,000 introduction fee. He was seen at the weekend with her on a night out in Sumy - 1,700 miles from his home in Hartlepool. The fraudster was jailed for six years and . three months in 2008 for claiming £500,000 in insurance . money with his then wife Anne. He . was declared dead in 2003 – a year after apparently drowning on a canoe . trip. Yet he was living in a hidden part of the pair’s home before they . moved to Panama in 2007. The swindle deceived the police, a coroner, a number of financial institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony. Under . the terms of his early release on licence from prison in 2011, Darwin . was not allowed to leave the UK without Probation Service permission. It . is understood a warrant will be issued for his arrest so he will be . held as soon as he returns to the country. He will be forced to serve . out the remaining nine months of his prison sentence. Last night Darwin was thought to be staying in the Ukrainian capital Kiev and considering his next move. The Ministry of Justice advised that offenders who breach the . terms of their licence in this way will be returned to prison to serve . the rest of their sentence. One Probation Service source in the North East added: ‘I do not know what he was thinking by flying off to Ukraine. ‘There is an arrogance about Mr Darwin – he must have thought he could get away with it but he is very wrong about that.’ Trip: John Darwin, left, who was jailed for orchestrating a life insurance scam with his wife Anne, right, has been seen on a dinner date with a 25-year-old woman in Ukraine . Officially . the Probation Service refused to discuss individual cases but a . spokesman said: ‘Any offender subject to licence supervision is required . to gain permission from probation to travel outside of the UK; . permission is only granted in exceptional circumstances. ‘Any offender who travels without this permission will be subject to recall to custody. ‘In these circumstances the Probation Service works closely with the police to implement the recall.’ The . Daily Mail has learned he flew to Ukraine last Thursday before boarding . a sleeper train for the town of Sumy in the north east of the country. According . to one newspaper, Darwin met his statuesque date at his hotel on . Saturday before a two-hour meal along with another woman who . interpreted. When confronted by a reporter he said he had a migraine. Told . that it was likely the authorities would be in touch on his return, he . replied: ‘Well, I’ll have an even bigger headache then.’ Darwin admitted . fraud five years ago in court and received a slightly shorter sentence . than Anne, who denied the offences. In December 2007, he walked into a London police station claiming he had amnesia and was reunited with his stunned sons. Darwin now lives in a £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, and survives on a pension of £138 a week. It . was also unclear last night which travel documents he used to visit . Ukraine as it was thought his passport was not due to be returned to him . until March. The family of . John Jones – whose birth certificate Darwin used to obtain a false . passport before he vanished in 2002 – spoke out yesterday. Journey: Darwin travelled 1,700 miles from Britain to Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine for his date. He was last night thought to be in Kiev . Canoe: Darwin's boat was recovered from the sea in March 2002 but there was no trace of him for five years . Alfred Jones . said : ‘It’s appalling. I don’t know how he got out of the country when . his passport was supposed to be revoked. ‘I can only think he has used another fake ID. ‘Darwin . has become a pain in the neck for our family. It’s been six years since . we found out he used [my brother] John’s birth certificate. ‘I . don’t understand how he has the money to be going visiting his . girlfriend in the Ukraine when he’s broke and living off the state. ‘I work really hard and I can’t do that.’ Home: The house in Hartlepool where the Darwins lived before moving to Panama .","Darwin, 63, pictured with 25-year-old Anna on night out in Sumy, Ukraine .

Deeply unsettling hidden camera footage that shows unsupervised children actually pointing guns left unattended towards their own faces has been released. The video was shot by ABC News as an experiment to highlight a new study published in the medical journal Pediatrics that has revealed 10,000 American children are injured or killed by guns each year. Despite being given gun safety lessons just days before at their St. Petersburg, Florida, school, some children approach the guns and wave them around for minutes before calling for help from their teacher - who had left the class for the test. Scroll Down for Video: . Terrible: This little boy aims a real handgun left intentionally unattended at his face while the teacher was out of the room in St. Petersburg, Florida as part of a joint Yale and ABC News study . Seven hidden cameras were placed around the classroom, while two unloaded, but real guns were placed inside toy boxes for the kids to find. Police, the children's parents who had agreed to the experiment and the Yale researchers who authored the study then watched how the kids reacted to the presence of the guns. The frightening response from two children showed them stare down the barrels and then wave the firearms around before shouting for help from an adult as they had been taught just days previously. To compound the shocking footage, the parents who agreed to let their children be secretly filmed all told ABC News and the Yale researchers that they were confident their children would alert an adult immediately. Not toys: This boy handles the gun like it is a toy after he begun rummaging around in a playbox at his school in Florida while filmed for the ABC News experiment . Frightening: While the guns were not loaded - they were real - and the children waited minutes and played with them before calling for help from teachers at their school . The fact they did not only served to highlight the unsettling study from the Yale School of Medicine which reported on the toll gun violence has had on child mortality rates in the United States. Based on the most recently released data from 2009, researchers discovered that over 7,000 children are hospitalized or killed due to gun violence and that an additional 3,00 children die from gun injuries before they even get to the hospital. More staggering statistics show that 1.7 million children live in a home with an unlocked and loaded firearm and that 1 child or teen is injured every hour by firearms in the US. 'This study reinforces what we know from the mortality data,' Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told NBC News. 'We have an extraordinary health burden in our youth associated with firearms injuries.' The data from 2009 reveals that 7,391 children under the age of 20 had been hospitalized from firearm injuries and 4,559 resulted from intentional uses of the weapons.See more US News from ABC|ABC World News . Hidden: The guns were placed in parts of the classroom the children would go to and were easily accesible . Scary: One of the guns is visible inside a toy-box from the classroom in St. Petersburg . Of that number, 2.149 were injured in accidents and 270 were suicide attempts and of the children who were hospitalized, 453 – 6 percent – died from their injuries. Younger children - 20.8 percent of the number - were also more likely than 15- to 19-year-olds (8.3%) to suffer a traumatic brain injury. Almost 90 percent of the cases were also more likely to be boys. Racial disparity was also high, with 47 percent of the hospitalizations occurring in black children , with black kids 10 times more likely than white children to be a victim of guns. According to CBS News little more than half of the injuries (52 percent) involved open wounds, followed by fractures (50 percent), then chest, abdomen or pelvis internal injuries (32 percent). Sobering: This mother watches as her child waves around a gun inside the classroom while left unattended - she had volunteered her child because she thought they would be responsible around guns . 'That’s more than 7,000 children injured badly enough to be hospitalized,' said the study’s lead author, Dr. John Leventhal, a pediatrics professor at the Yale School of Medicine. 'All are unnecessary hospitalizations because preventing gun violence is something that can actually be done.' In an obvious suggestion, Levanthal said that to bring down this number, parents should keep their guns locked and hidden and separate from ammunition to keep their children safe. Webster also suggested to NBC News that the government should make it illegal for individuals under 21 to own a firearm. 'While you have to be 21 to purchase a handgun from a dealer, if you’re an 18-year-old you can go to a private seller and legally purchase a handgun in 38 out of 50 states,' Webster said to NBC News. Like buying groceries: Shoppers at the Walmart Super Center can buy weapons with ease . Parents looked to the sky in grief following the Sandy Hook massacre of December 2012 . Another damning statistic was that the mortality rate among children from firearms in the US was nearly 10 times higher than other wealthy nations. 'This is a very unique and abnormal problem that such a wealthy nation should have such high mortality and morbidity in youth related to firearms,' he said. Gun control is high on the political agenda at the moment with the tragedy at Sandy Hook in December 2012 still raw. In the first 14 school days of 2014, there have been at least 7 school shootings: at Wakefield Elementary School in Calif., Berrendo Middle School in New Mexico, Liberty Technology High School in Tenn., Albany High School in Georgia, Delaware Valley Charter School in Penn., Widener University in Penn., and most recently, Purdue University in Indiana.

An eight-year-old boy collapsed and died from an unknown illness as he returned home from a small Missouri school. Bradley Voss, a third-grade student, had complained of a headache before leaving for school on Monday morning, but teachers said he had appeared healthy in class. When he collapsed on the bus ride home, about half a mile from school, the driver returned to Strain-Japan School and tried to revive him using CPR. Unexpected: Bradley Voss was on his way home from Strain Japan School, above, when he collapsed and died . An autopsy on Tuesday morning failed to find a cause for Bradley's sudden death. Authorities must now wait for test results, which could take several weeks to arrive. He had been given a painkiller by his mother before leaving for school, after he complained of a headache. 'She’d given him some kind of aspirin. Tylenol or something like that,' Franklin County Sheriff Gary Toelke told Fox 2. He added that Bradley's death was not being treated as suspicious, but said police had returned to the school as part of routine investigations. The unexpected death has hit the rural school of 70 students hard. 'It’s been a very difficult time, and . trying to stay as strong as you can for the rest of the students and . staff here,' principal Anita Studdard said.

It also claimed Facebook's own algorithms should be tweaked to make more partisan stories appear. The Georgia Institute of Technology study found users tend to stick in their own circles and ignore friends whose beliefs they don't agree with. The study surveyed more than 100 politically active Facebook users in the spring of 2013 amid debates about budgets cuts, gay marriage and gun control regulations. The majority of participants were liberal, female and under the age of 40, mirroring the traditional Facebook user.

When they saw something they didn’t agree with, 60 percent said they ignored it and didn’t comment. When they did, sometimes it made the person question the relationship and disassociate and from the friend. 'People are mainly friends with those who share similar values and interests. 'They tend to interact with them the most, a phenomenon called homophily,' said Catherine Grevet, the Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who led the study. 'But that means they rarely interact with the few friends with differing opinions. 'As a result, they aren’t exposed to opposing viewpoints.'

The study also found Facebook may be partly to blame - as its algorithms learn what we like. Grevet suggests that the social media site should sprinkle in a few status updates on both sides of political issues. That would expose people to different opinions, which are typically held by weak ties. 'Designing social media toward nudging users to strengthen relationships with weak ties with different viewpoints could have beneficial consequences for the platform, users and society,' she said.

Remnants of Neanderthal DNA in the genes of non-African modern humans are linked to a range of health problems and behaviours including type 2 diabetes and smoking . If you are a hairy diabetic who smokes and suffers from stomach cramps, blame your Neanderthal ancestry. Remnants of Neanderthal DNA in the genes of non-African modern humans are linked to a range of health problems, including Type 2 diabetes, Crohn’s disease, lupus and biliary cirrhosis, a study has shown. They are also associated with smoking and thick hair, as well as tough skin and nails. Between two per cent and four per cent of the genome, or genetic code map, of Europeans and Asians is believed to be a legacy of interbreeding between ancient Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. The two were separate human subspecies who co-existed on Earth for thousands of years until the Neanderthals became extinct around 30,000 years ago. Indigenous people from sub-Saharan Africa, whose ancestors did not migrate out of the continent to breed with Eurasian Neanderthals, carry little or no Neanderthal DNA. A new DNA comparison study has now shone a spotlight on important aspects of Neanderthal inheritance. Scientists compared genetic variants in the DNA of 846 people of non-African heritage, 176 people from sub-Saharan Africa, and the toe bone of a 50,000-year-old Neanderthal woman. A near-complete reconstruction of the Neanderthal’s genome was published last year. The team identified some areas of the modern non-African genetic code that were rich in Neanderthal DNA while others looked like Neanderthal-free zones. A number of variants inherited from Neanderthals were linked to diseases, especially autoimmune disorders. Crohn’s, which causes inflammation of the gut, lupus and the liver disease biliary cirrhosis are all problems triggered by an over-zealous immune system. In addition, one genetic variant, or ‘allele’, was associated with smoking, specifically in Europeans. Professor David Reich, from Harvard Medical School in the U.S., who led the study reported in the journal Nature, said: ‘Now that we can estimate the probability that a particular genetic variant arose from Neanderthals, we can begin to understand how that inherited DNA affects us. ‘We may also learn more about what Neanderthals themselves were like.’ Between two per cent and four per cent of the genome, or genetic code map, of Europeans and Asians is believed to be a legacy of interbreeding between ancient Homo sapiens and Neanderthals . Among the discoveries was the fact that Neanderthal ancestry could be seen in genes for keratin filaments, a fibrous protein that lends toughness to skin, hair and nails. This may have helped provide the newcomers from Africa thicker insulation against the cold European climate. ‘It’s tempting to think that Neanderthals were already adapted to the non-African environment and provided this genetic benefit to (modern) humans,’ Professor Reich said. The ‘desert’ regions that contained far less Neanderthal DNA than average were associated with male fertility. DNA from a Neanderthal woman's 50,000-year-old toe bone shows she was highly inbred. Scientists from the University of California discovered that her parents were either half-siblings who shared the same mother, an uncle and niece, an aunt and nephew, or a grandparent and grandchild. Alternatively, they may have been double first cousins - offspring of two siblings and their siblings. The inbreeding may have been the result of Neanderthal population groups being very small, experts believe. Analysis of the DNA also revealed evidence of interbreeding between Neanderthals, Denisovans - a Neanderthal sister group from Siberia - and early modern humans. They may hold clues to why the Neanderthals and Denisovans died out while modern humans survived. This suggests that the two sub-species were sufficiently far apart to put them ‘at the edge of biological incompatibility’, according to the professor. Ancient modern human and Neanderthal populations apparently found it hard to breed successfully after 500,000 years of evolutionary separation. A number of DNA variants inherited from Neanderthals are linked to diseases such as diabetes, Crohn's disease and lupus . The team is following up the research by testing for Neanderthal mutations in a biobank containing genetic data from half a million Britons. Professor Chris Stringer, a leading expert in human origins at London’s Natural History Museum, said the findings added a new twist to the debate over how early modern humans related to Neanderthals and Denisovans, another subspecies cousin from Siberia. He did not think it undermined current thinking about our ancestors’ African origins. ‘The genetic data also show there are thousands of DNA changes that are unique to Homo sapiens, and these distinctions are likely to have accumulated during the several hundred thousand years since Homo sapiens separated from the Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages as they evolved in Africa and Eurasia, respectively,’ he said. ‘Our genetic heritage is still largely from a recent African origin, despite the interbreeding with other human populations that undoubtedly occurred.’ A parallel study in the journal Science suggests that up to a fifth of the Neanderthal genome may have survived in modern human populations. This was despite the fact that the proportion of Neanderthal DNA in any one individual is low, around two per cent to four per cent. The U.S. scientists, from the University of Washington, Seattle, compared ancient and modern DNA sequences in 600 present-day humans from Europe and East Asia.","Remnants of Neanderthal DNA in the genes of non-African modern humans are linked to a range of health problems including diabetes and Crohn's .

An Arizona heart surgeon's claim that a diet of unprocessed foods - not necessarily low-fat foods - can prevent and even reverse heart disease has ignited the Internet. Dr. Dwight Lundell has dished the dirt on 'what really causes heart disease' and he admits prescribing cholesterol-lowering medications, and a low-fat, high-simple carbohydrate diet for two-and-a-half decades was misguided. 'These recommendations are no longer scientifically or morally defensible,' he writes in an essay, that has been posted on some 250,000 Facebook pages since it appeared on a website called Tuned Body in December. truth: Dr. Dwight Lundell, pictured, has dished the dirt on 'what really causes heart disease' and he admits prescribing cholesterol-lowering medications, and a low-fat, high-simple carbohydrate diet for two-and-a-half decades was misguided . This idea may not seem all that revolutionary, but hearing Lundell's vivid imagery about what exactly processed foods actually do to the body would put anyone off their Twinkie. He explains that this once 'healthy' diet actively destroys the walls of our blood vessels by causing chronic inflammation. This inflammation makes cholesterol stick to the walls, forming the plaques that eventually block them, resulting in a heart attack or stroke. 'When you spike your blood sugar level several times a day, every day, it is exactly like taking sandpaper to the inside of your delicate blood vessels,' he writes. The former cardiac surgeon, who says he's 'peered inside thousands upon thousands of arteries' slams refined carbohydrates as well as the proportion of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the Western diet. Ouch: Lundell explains that processed foods, such as Twinkies, actively destroy the walls of our blood vessels by causing chronic inflammation which results in blocked vessels . Fruits and veggies: 'There is but one answer to quieting inflammation and that is returning to foods closer to their natural state,' Lundell writes . Cure? Lundell first made his 'confession' in his book The Cure for Heart Disease, ipctured . He said the heavy load of omega-6 acids vs omega-3 in corn and soybean oils - about 15:1 when it should be 3:1 - are too much for the body to process. But he insists there's a silver bullet, and it's not all that surprising. 'There is but one answer to quieting inflammation and that is returning to foods closer to their natural state,' Lundell writes. Don't eat anything your grandmother wouldn't recognize as food, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and lean protein, he recommends. He says don't stress about saturated fats but make sure it's olive oil, grass-fed meat or full fat dairy that you're choosing over high-omega-6 processed foods. 'Since we now know that cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease, the concern about saturated fat is even more absurd today,' he writes. Since penning the article, Dr. Lundell has come under fire from the blog Quackwatch, which revealed a past fraught with legal issues including having his medical license revoked in 2008. The blog's author Dr. Stephen Barrett concluded, 'Dr. Lundell would like you to believe that he has special knowledge of heart disease prevention. I do not trust his advice.' However, the basic ideas behind what Lundell writes in the essay have become far more accepted in the treatment of heart disease and other health problems since he first made his 'confession' in a 2007 book The Cure for Heart Disease. Though regular exercise and reducing stress should be added to such a diet for ultimate health, other experts point out, disputing the 'silver bullet' claim.","Dr. Dwight Lundell has dished the dirt on 'what really causes heart disease' - processed foods .

Bold scheme: But Nick Clegg's plan to offer free school meals to all young state school children is in chaos, Government sources have said . Nick Clegg’s flagship plan to extend free school meals to all young state school children is in chaos – with thousands likely to have to eat cold packed lunches in classrooms, according to Government sources. The Deputy Prime Minister announced at the last Liberal Democrat conference that all children between the ages of five and seven would qualify for the free meals from September 2014. But even some colleagues concede that the £785 million scheme was dreamt up ‘on the back of a fag packet’ and its funding is now in turmoil. Sources at the Department for Education say Mr Clegg failed to take into account the cost of upgrading kitchen facilities to meet the demand, forcing the Government to offer £150million to pay for the building work. But the rush to introduce the new entitlement before the 2015 general election means that there is no time to determine which schools and local authorities genuinely need cash. So councils such as Durham and Newham in East London, which have already upgraded their school facilities, will get extra funding while others which say they need more assistance will not get it. Though initially the Government pledged a ‘hot, nutritious meal’ for all children in reception and years one and two, ministers have also now accepted that not all schools have the space to provide one. Cold packed lunches eaten at classroom desks will also qualify, since many schools do not have dedicated dining rooms and use gyms and school halls to serve lunch. Heads say space used for teaching and activities cannot be turned over for extended lunchtimes accommodating many more students. Sir Nick Harvey, a former Lib Dem defence minister, said: ‘It’s no great surprise that these practical reasons have arisen given that the whole policy appears to have been dreamt up overnight and sketched out on the back of a fag packet. 'It sounds as if the meals are going to be as half-baked as the policy.’ Despite Britain’s vast budget deficit, Mr Clegg announced that regardless of their parents’ income, all children in the first three years of primary school will qualify for free school meals - saving even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child. The annual cost of the scheme is to be met through spending cuts elsewhere and moves to clamp down on tax avoidance. However, critics have questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all families with young children, while taking the axe to other universal payments such as child benefit for the better-off. Currently, free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families, and many of those who are entitled do not claim because of the stigma attached to doing so. Extending them to all under-sevens in state education is designed to show the coalition is taking further steps to help families with the cost of living. Big giveaway: The Deputy Prime Minister announced at the last Liberal Democrat conference that all children between the ages of five and seven would qualify for the free meals from September 2014 . The plan was part of a Lib Dem deal with the Tories that meant them agreeing to a similar sum being spent on a £200-a-year tax break for married couples. But the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is warning that many schools ‘absolutely can’t think how they are going to do this’. Furthermore, the change threatens to undermine another flagship Lib Dem policy - the pupil premium, which means that schools receive £900 a year more for every child who currently qualifies for free school meals. Critics predict that still fewer families will come forward to declare their income, given that in future they will qualify for free food whether they do so or not. Some councils are also predicting the scheme will lead to deep cuts elsewhere in the education budget. Oxfordshire County Council says it is facing a £9million shortfall in the funding needed to upgrade kitchens and dining rooms at its schools in order to deliver the pledge. Oxfordshire said it had been offered just £1.1million, despite facing an estimated £10 million bill. The council’s Tory leader Ian Hudspeth said: ‘The minute this announcement was made, councils across the country strongly suspected that they would not receive the full funding from central Government to deliver on this pledge. ‘Sadly we look like being proved right, and Oxfordshire is no exception. ‘If the Deputy Prime Minister makes pledges like this relating to locally delivered services, they need to make sure they are properly funded. We have let central Government know of our unhappiness as regards this situation and we will continue to do so.’ The Local Government Association (LGA) warned there was a danger that communities could be ‘short-changed’ unless ministers produce more cash to pay for the refurbishments needed.","Former Lib Dem minister slams 'back of a fag packet' accounting .

A businessman worth millions installed another woman into his home and asked his partner of 30 years if she would stay on as a housekeeper, a High Court judge heard. And the man - who has interests in a portfolio of property in London - could not understand why his partner 'through her lawyers' became 'so aggressive', said Mr Justice Bodey. Detail emerged today as the partner was awarded a payout of more than £6million by the judge after the couple fought over money at a hearing in London. Mr Justice Bodey ruled that she was entitled to nearly half of a 'kitty' containing more than £13million. The judge had analysed arguments over how much the partner should get, following the breakdown of the relationship, at a private trial in the Family Division of the High Court. He said his judgment could be reported but said the couple, from London, could not be identified. The man was in his 70s and the partner in her 50s, said Mr Justice Bodey. They had married in the late Seventies and divorced in the Nineties. But the judge said they treated the divorce as 'just a piece of paper' and carried on living together. About five years ago the man met another woman. 'The husband installed the other woman - and her 12-year-old daughter - into the marital home,' said Mr Justice Bodey. 'The husband told (his partner) he was not intending her to vacate and would she remain as some sort of housekeeper?' He said she found the suggestion 'very demeaning and upsetting' and consulted solicitors. But the man told her that he would 'commit suicide or go on hunger strike' if she 'went to court regarding financial matters'.

She had little recollection of some of the events that ensued on the flight but said she would have behaved reasonably if the cabin crew had left her alone. However she admitted she should not have drunk as much as she did. Judge Dominic Flatley told MacKay her actions would have been 'extremely frightening' to other passengers. He added that her behaviour would also have had an impact on flight crew. She was sentenced to 300 hours community service, 12 months supervision and told she had to complete drug and alcohol counselling.","Woman got drunk on Air NZ flight in August and attacked flight staff .

David Cameron yesterday dismissed a Labour call for him to apologise for Margaret Thatcher’s handling of the miners’ strike – insisting militant union leader Arthur Scargill should say sorry for his ‘appalling’ conduct. The Prime Minister reacted with bemusement to Labour’s launch of a ‘justice for the coalfields’ campaign demanding a fresh inquiry into the strike and a formal apology from the Government. The opposition says recently-released Cabinet papers relating to the 30-year-old dispute show the Thatcher government had a secret plan to close 75 pits and put pressure on police to crack down on pickets. David Cameron refused to issue an apology for the Thatcher government's handling of the miner's strike, but suggester then-union leader Arthur Scargill should say sorry . Labour MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy insisted at Prime Minister’s Questions that miners and their families deserved an apology. ‘The scars of that dispute run deep in communities like Wigan,’ she said. ‘Some families have never recovered and others have died waiting for justice.’ But Mr Cameron rejected the call, saying: ‘I think if anyone needs to . make an apology for their role in the miners’ strike it should be Arthur . Scargill for the appalling way that he led  that union.’ The opposition’s campaign is apparently designed to boost support in the Labour heartlands. However . it has horrified some Labour MPs who are warning it appears the party . is backing Mr Scargill, a hate figure for most voters, in a 30-year-old . argument. Shadow Cabinet . Office minister, Michael Dugher raised the issue in the Commons, . challenging ministers to set out ‘all details of the interactions . between the Government and the police at the time’. He made his appeal in the wake of the National Archives' release of Cabinet papers from the 1980s which indicated that the Thatcher government had secret plans to close 75 pits and considered sending in troops to break the strike. The Barnsley East MP, who has launched a Justice for the Coalfields campaign, particularly wants communications relating to the confrontation between miners and police at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire. He called for action before the 30th anniversary of the so-called Battle of Orgreave on July 18. But Tory Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude rejected the idea out of hand, insisting all of the relevant documents will be released 'in the usual way' under the law that was passed by the last Labour government. He added: 'I was representing a coal mining constituency during the miners' strike. I saw first-hand the violence, the intimidation, the divided communities, in a dispute that took place without a proper national ballot being held. So you asked for an apology - no.' Campaign: Labour want to make David Cameron issue a formal public apology for Margaret Thatcher's handling of the miners' strike in the 1980s . Later at Prime Minister's Questions Mr . Cameron went further and said Labour should also learn lessons from the . strikes as former party leader Lord Kinnock at the time refused to . condemn the fact there was no ballot. He . told MPs: 'I have to say, I think if anyone needs to make an apology . for their role in the miners' strike it should be Arthur Scargill for . the appalling way that he led that union. 'I . think while we are at it, if other people want to ask about their . roles, there was the role of the leader of Labour Party, who at the time . never condemned the fact that they wouldn't hold a ballot. So I think . there are lessons for Labour to learn and judging from their performance . today, they haven't learned any of them.' Labour claims that there should be a ‘proper investigation’ into the ugliest confrontation of the strike in 1984, when 10,000 striking miners clashed with 5,000 police officers in what became known as the Battle of Orgreave.

Labour’s ‘justice for the coalfields’ campaign as absurd. ‘Next . they’ll want an apology for freeing the Falklands,’ the Conservative . peer said. ‘I presume Ed Miliband is doing this in order to get some . more money from Unite [the union]. ‘My . recollection is that the police were principally used to protect miners . who wanted to go to work and who had not been granted a ballot, but . were being prevented from doing so by [National Union of Mineworkers . leader] Arthur Scargill’s hate mob. ‘Neither Labour nor Scargill has ever apologised for that.’ Lord Tebbit added: ‘I trust the Government will merely laugh at this ridiculous campaign.’ It is likely to cause unease among the dwindling band of Blairite Labour MPs, who will fear that the party risks alienating Middle England by appearing to back Mr Scargill in a 30-year-old argument. The move comes after the release of Cabinet papers earlier this month showing that Lady Thatcher came within days of declaring a state of emergency and calling out the military four months into the miners’ strike. Scathing: Lord Tebbit, who was Baroness Thatcher¿s trade and industry secretary during the strike, dismissed Labour's 'justice for the coalfields' campaign as absurd . Dismissal: Lord Tebbit, pictured with Margaret Thatcher in 1985, said he presumed Labour was campaigning for an apology to get money from union Unite . Ministers secretly discussed recalling Parliament in the summer of 1984 to pass emergency legislation, according to documents released to the National Archives. The files show that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal, but the idea was dismissed on the grounds that it would cause panic. Labour says the papers also suggest that the Thatcher government had a secret plan to close 75 pits at the cost of 65,000 jobs and that it sought to influence police tactics to escalate the dispute. Industrial action was triggered in March 1984 by plans to close 20 loss-making pits. Mr Scargill went into battle with the Tories and a year-long war of attrition ensued.

A tattered scrap of papyrus has been found to feature original Sappho poetry dating back to the 7th century BC. Oxford papyrologist Dr. Dirk Obbink was asked to translate the ancient text by the unidentified owner and was shocked to discover it featured not one, but two of the Greek poet's original verses. Only a handful of original Sappho poetry has survived, printed on various fragments of papyrus, and only one of these poems is written in full. The papyrus, pictured, was translated by Oxford papyrologist Dr. Dirk Obbink who confirmed it features two poems written by 7th century Greek poet Sappho. The first contains reference to Sappho's family, while the other is a poem addressed to the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite . Sappho was a Greek lyrist renowned for her verses about love and loss. In particular, many of her poems described a love of women and female homosexuality. In fact, modern-day words including 'lesbian' and 'sapphic', are said to have derived from Sappho, her poems and her time on the isle of Lesbos. In total, Sappho wrote nine volumes of poems and while these latest findings do not feature complete poems, due to the tattered edges of the papyrus, there is a substantial amount of text to confirm they are Sapphic in style. The first poem contains reference to two men called Charaxos and Larichos. Sappho (Roman bust pictured right) was a Greek poet believed to have been born between 630 and 612 BC. She was an aristocrat who married a merchant, and had a daughter called Cleis. During the 7th century BC, Sappho spent time studying the arts on the isle of Lesbos writing poetry and composing music. She wrote her poems in what’s now become known as the ‘sapphic meter’ and was part of a new wave of Greek lyrists who wrote poetry from their own viewpoint, rather than the viewpoint of the gods, which was traditional during that time. In particular, Sappho was one of the first poets to describe love, and loss, as it affected her personally. Many of her poems expressed love and affection for women and modern-day words used to describe female homosexuality, namely 'lesbian' and 'sapphic', derived from Sappho, her poems and her time on the isle of Lesbos. Many modern poets have been inspired by Sappho, including Michael Field, Renée Vivien and Marie-Madeleine, who have all cited Sappho as a strong influence on their work. These are the names the Ancient Greeks gave to Sappho’s brothers, yet the poem is the first evidence of them found in Sappho’s poetry. It describes a conversation between two people about the success of Charaxos’ latest sea voyage and appears to be written in the first person. The other is a poem addressed to the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. A horizontal red line signifies where one poem ends and the other begins. Sappho and Alcaeus by Lawrence Alma-Tadema. Sappho was a 7th century Greek lyrist renowned for her verses about love and loss. In particular, many of her poems described love of women and female homosexuality and modern-day words including lesbian and sapphic derive from Sappho . Only a handful of original poems and poem fragments have survived, including this papyrus found in 1922 . As Dr. Obbink explained: ‘All the poems of Sappho’s first book seem to have been about family, biography, and cult, together with poems about love [and] Aphrodite.' The poems were also written in a Greek dialect called Aeolic, a language Sappho often used to write her poems in, and which was different from Attic Greek. Additionally, both were written in the so-called Sapphic stanza - a poetic meter created by Sappho - and Dr Obbink claims this leaves him in no doubt the poems are from Sappho’s original poetry collection. 'The new Sappho is the best preserved Sappho papyrus in existence, with just a few letters that had to be restored in the first poem, and not a single word that is in doubt. Its content is equally exciting.' According to Dr Obbink, the style of handwriting suggests the poem was transcribed onto the papyrus in around the 3rd century A.D . Daughter of Zeus, Immortal, Aphrodite, serene. Weaver of spells, at thy portal hear me and slay not, O Queen! As in the past, hither to me from thy far palace of gold, drawn by the doves that overflew me, come, as thou earnest of old. Swiftly thy flock bore thee hither, smiling, as turned I to thee, spoke thou across the blue weather: . ‘Sappho, why callest thou me? Sappho, what Beauty disdains thee, Sappho, who wrongest thine heart, Sappho, what evil now pains thee, Whence sped the dart? ‘Flies from thee, soon she shall follow, turns from thee, soon she shall love, seeking thee swift as the swallow, ingrate though now she may prove.’ Come, once again to release me, join with my fire thy fire, freed from the torments that seize me, give me, O Queen! my desire!

The number of police officers in England and Wales fell by almost 3,500 last year to the lowest level in more than a decade. The 2.6 per cent dip in officer numbers follows a sharp reduction in funding. Overall, there were 128,351 in the 43 forces of England and Wales on September 30 last year, the lowest figure since September 2002. Even thinner blue line: The number of police officers in England and Wales fell by almost 3,500 last year. The 2.6 per cent dip in their numbers leave the police force at its lowest strength for more than a decade . There has been an even more marked decline in the number of community support officers, or PCSOs. There are now only 13,552, down six per cent in a year. Despite cuts, crime has fallen and ministers say the police are more efficient. The statistics were not due out until today, but were mistakenly published on the Home Office’s website yesterday. Officials - already under fire over the trustworthiness of police crime figures - were then forced to rush forward their release date. Chief Constable Mike Cunningham, of the Association of Chief Police officers, said: ‘With reduced recruitment and the considerable cuts made to policing budgets, it is not surprising that the number of officers and staff have reduced, and this clearly presents a challenge for the police service. ‘However, the effectiveness of policing cannot be measured by the number of officers and staff alone. ‘The service has risen to the challenge of dealing with significant financial restraints and continued to maintain the protection of the public.' Blunkett Bobbies: There has been an even more marked decline in the number of community support officers, or PCSOs. There are now only 13,552, down six per cent in a year . Last week, constabularies in England and Wales yesterday reported that the number of crimes fell by 3 per cent last year. The separate British Crime Survey showed crime falling by 10 per cent year on year to its lowest level since records began in 1981. The survey is traditionally seen as a more reliable barometer of crime levels over time. It showed sharp falls in violence - by 13 per cent - and snatch thefts. Crimes against households fell 10 per cent and bike theft was down 15 per cent, to its lowest level in a decade. But there is mounting controversy over whether the crime figures can be trusted. The UK Statistics Authority has questioned the reliability of the police’s figures and stripped them of their ‘gold standard’ status. 'Police reform is working': Policing Minister Damian Green denied claims that official crime statistics were masking the truth on offences . Experts predict that, when the figures are audited properly, crime will once again begin to rise. In Kent - where figures have been ‘cleaned up’ after a period of manipulation - recorded crime has risen by 8 per cent. If the same pattern was repeated across the country nearly 300,000 extra crimes would be reported. In Kent, violent crime was up a fifth and sex offences and robbery by half. Drug offences were up by 14 per cent, public order offences by 16 per cent and other ‘miscellaneous’ crimes by a third. It is thought much of the increase is related to the more rigorous recording techniques. Yesterday, David Cameron said recorded crime statistics must be as 'robust as possible'. But he added that both recorded crime and the BCS had ‘fallen by more than 10 per cent’. Policing Minister Damian Green said: 'Police reform is working and two independent measures show crime is falling. Getting the economy back on track has meant the police have had to do more with less, but they have shown an impressive ability to make savings while still cutting crime. 'What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are. HMIC has made clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided. 'Ultimately, decisions on the size and composition of a police force’s workforce are for individual chief officers and Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs).' Last night, Labour’s Shadow Policing Minister, Jack Dromey said: ‘The Police Service Strength Figures mistakenly published today will rightly cause concern in communities all over England and Wales. ‘The Government is hollowing out our Police Service. Labour put 17,000 more Police Officers on the beat. Now, that progress has been reversed.’","There were 128,351 officers in England and Wales after 2.6 per cent dip .

Scotland could never be fully independent if it keeps the pound, the Governor of the Bank of England warned yesterday. Mark Carney said that Scotland would have to share sovereignty with the rest of the UK to avoid creating economic havoc. His assessment of a ‘Yes’ vote on September 18 suggested that Scotland would need to surrender control of interest rates and agree to strict rules controlling tax and spending.

Otherwise . it would risk a eurozone-style disaster, where stronger nations, . including the UK and Germany, have been forced to  prop up heavily . indebted smaller ones, such as Greece. Mr . Carney insisted in a speech in Edinburgh that he was not passing . judgment on whether Scotland should be independent or on what currency . arrangements an independent Scotland could make. And he refused to be drawn over whether Scotland would be better or worse off as an independent nation. But . his intervention carried the clear implication that Scotland can either . be fully independent or stay with sterling – but not both. The governor’s speech is likely to be a pivotal moment in the referendum battle, with just 230 days left until the vote. Down to business: Bank of England governor Mark Carney gives a speech in Edinburgh . Mr Carney gave his first speech in Scotland as governor of the Bank Of England coming ahead of the 18 September independence referendum . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond insists an independent Scotland would keep the pound. But a spokesman for George Osborne yesterday said it was ‘highly unlikely’ that the UK Government would agree to it. Chancellor George Osborne has vowed to veto any currency union between the UK and an independent Scotland . The . Chancellor’s spokesman said: ‘Governor Carney highlights the principled . difficulties of entering a currency union: losing national sovereignty, . practical risks of financial instability and having to provide fiscal . support to bail out another country. ‘This . is why the UK Government have consistently said that in the event of . independence, a currency union is highly unlikely to be agreed. The . Scottish government needs a Plan B.’ Former . Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together . campaign against Scottish independence, said: ‘Make no mistake, the . Governor’s judgement on currency unions is devastating for Alex . Salmond’s currency plans.’ And . John Cridland, director-general of the CBI business lobby group, said: . ‘Successful currency unions need strong fiscal agreements and a banking . union. ‘This underlines why the CBI believes that the nations of the UK are stronger together.’ After . a meeting with Mr Salmond, Governor Carney said: ‘A durable, successful . currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty.’ Mr Carney acknowledged there are a number of benefits of currency unions, such as ease of trade and travel between countries. But . he said there were also risks, including ‘the potentially large costs’ of giving up a flexible exchange rate and putting interest rates in the . hands of the Bank of England in London. He . added that the risks of a poorly constructed currency union have been . ‘demonstrated clearly in the euro area over recent years’. Independence advocates say they want to continue to use the pound as the country's currency if the Scottish people vote for separation in 2014 . He . said that an agreement would have to be hammered out on ‘all aspects’ of formal currency union between Scotland and the rest of the UK. These . would have to include strict controls on the levels of Scotland’s debt . and deficit. He said ‘tight fiscal rules’ will be required to ensure . that Scotland runs its finances prudently rather than rely on support . from taxpayers elsewhere in the UK. Mr . Carney also pointed out that there would have to be a ‘banking union’ with a central bank capable of bailing out failed lenders and propping . up the financial system. That . would mean England, Wales and Northern Ireland would have to rescue the . Scottish banking system and the Edinburgh government if another . financial crisis on the same scale as 2008 struck.

Allegations of rumours of a fling between Kerry Miller (left) and former Burton Albion FC goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson (right) have emerged today on the third day of her employment tribunal . Ms Miller was rumoured to have been seeing 28-year-old Mr Tomlinson (pictured) between September and Christmas 2012, the tribunal heard . She confessed to having a 'casual' relationship with former defender Ryan Austin, 29, who has since left the League Two club. On the third day of her employment tribunal today, the hearing heard of allegations of rumours she had been seeing 28-year-old goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012. Leicester Employment Tribunal heard she posted a picture on Facebook of herself with the model on a night out just hours after a crucial match. The following year Tomlinson turned his back on football after suffering a bad knee injury to pursue a career in WWE wrestling in America. Giving evidence the club’s chairman Ben Robinson said Mr Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team. A tribunal heard how Ms Miller (left) entered the dressing room on 15 occasions and also sent pictures of herself wearing underwear to striker Billy Kee (right) Asked if he was aware there were rumours of a relationship between the pair by her barrister James Bruce, Mr Robinson said: 'I was aware that it was suspected. I was aware of the discussion that Kerry might have been having a relationship with Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas. 'He was a male model and a male escort. I’ve had no problems with that.' Burton Albion’s club secretary and commercial director Fleur Robinson said she had spoken to Ms Miller after she posted an image of the pair together in a Chester night-club . Giving evidence Ms Robinson, who is also the chairman’s daughter, admitted she had 'raised an eyebrow' when the picture emerged on October 27, 2012 - just hours after a crucial game.

She told the tribunal: 'It was a Saturday and we had a home game against Bradford. 'Kerry had asked if she would be able to leave earlier than expected because she had to go out in Manchester. 'I said that was fine as long as everything was done by that time. I had no issues with her leaving an hour early. 'I remember sitting at home on the Saturday evening with my partner. I had a message off my brother saying have you seen this on Facebook? 'I thought it was a bit strange she had asked to go early to go to Manchester and seeing that picture I admit I raised an eyebrow. 'Kerry came to see me on the Thursday and said she wasn’t very happy about the way things had been dealt with over the weekend. Ms Miller, pictured in a bikini, has appeared at a tribunal claiming constructive dismissal . 'I said being seen out in a nightclub with an injured player probably wouldn’t be perceived very well by our supporters and sponsors and people connected with the club. 'I know Kerry was friends with other colleagues and one of the second major sponsors was a friend of hers on Facebook at the time. 'I asked her to be careful in future as to what she was doing in terms of any connections with any staff that could be in the social arena. 'I think we regret that we didn’t deal with things in a more formal manner.' Giving evidence the club's chairman Ben Robinson (pictured) said Mr Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team . Ms Robinson, who has worked at the club for 18 years and was Ms Miller’s line manager, also told the hearing she warned her after manager Gary Rowett complained about her bursting into the dressing rooms. She added: 'I had a conversation with Kerry and I said I had a conversation with the manager and a phone call with the chairman that a complaint had been made by a senior player about her entering the dressing room. 'I asked her if this was the case and she said it wasn’t. 'As the conversation developed Kerry admitted she had entered the dressing room. 'It was certainly on more than one occasion and the manager said to me it was on several occasions. 'It’s something I’ve never had to deal with in 18 years at the club. 'A female member of staff or any member of staff entering the players’ dressing room when they were in states of undress is completely unheard of. 'I was told by the manager that she had gone in unannounced.' The widow started working in a sales and support role at the club’s Pirelli Stadium in Burton-upon-Trent, Stafforshire, in September 2011 before she quit in February 2013 after a row with the chairman. Ms Miller, who lives in Marchington near Uttoxeter, denies bursting into the players’ dressing rooms before knocking. She is claiming constructive dismissal, sexual discrimination and harassment against the club who she is accusing of forcing her to quit. Burton Albion deny all her claims.

She was all over the chairman on one occasion. 'If I'm honest I felt it was a little bit desperate from her at times. According to me I think she liked the male attention so if there was any whistles or noises from the players she would like it. 'That's why I personally think we saw her on a daily basis. I thought she thrived on that. I've seen pictures on two players phones - Ryan Austin and Billy Kee. 'I heard she had a thing for him [Stuart Tomlinson] but I never heard a rumour they had slept together.' Burton striker Billy Kee told the tribunal yesterday afternoon how Ms Miller sent him  pictures in which she was topless. The 23-year-old, who still plays for the club, admitted he also sent two naked pictures of himself to Ms Miller after a night out in 2012. He told the hearing he didn't remember how they started texting but he remembered the messages started getting sexual after he 'drank a few pints'. Asked if he had sent two naked pictures, both not including his face, to Ms Miller by the club's barrister Sarah George, the striker simply answered 'yes'. And then asked if he received one snap of Ms Miller in her underwear and then another of her topless Mr Kee again replied 'yes'. Giving evidence he told the hearing: 'I remember I was on a night out and I don't know how we got texting but we ending up exchanging pictures. I think it was two from each side. 'I don't remember what words were used but if I was going to do it with someone else I would say ""you send me one and I'll send you one back"". 'I know it started as just innocent chit-chat. I think after a few pints it may have got sexual but I honestly don't remember.  The next day I received a text from her. 'I think she said ""I'm silly for sending them and I would appreciate it if you deleted them because it could cost me my job"". 'I showed them [the photos] to a few players, four including the physio. A couple of other players said ""come on mate, you shouldn't be doing that"".' Burton Albion's accounts manager Angela Lawley also told the tribunal Ms Miller was texting another married player from another professional club. She said the player - who was not named - also had children and would keep the phone he used to text Ms Miller hidden in his car's glove-box.

A neighbouring property belonging to a . family from Hong Kong was also searched during the operation in leafy . Streatham Hill, South London. It appears to be linked to a raid on magistrate Meena Patel's house in Stratford, East London, where a 36-year-old woman, believed to be her daughter, Kuntal, was also arrested under counter terrorism legislation. Mr Sutcliffe's grandmother Marjorie Hunter said: ‘James has nothing to worry about. This is nothing to do with him. He has been told by the police that he has done nothing wrong.' A friend of the teenager added: ‘I have been in contact with James. My understanding is it's all a bit of a mess–up. ‘He said the police realised pretty quickly that he had nothing to be accountable for. Position: Mr Sutcliffe, a senior diplomat, was posted to Brazil in the early 1990s . Anger: The diplomat's sister-in-law Jenny described James's arrest as 'lunacy' and a 'mix-up' ‘There didn't seem to be any obvious . connection between him and the woman who was arrested. He spends a lot . of time playing games online which is how I know him.' The teenager lives with his father Nicholas, 56, and his mother Carole, 54. The couple have three other grown-up sons, two of whom are at university and one of whom lives in Japan. Mr Sutcliffe, is described in the Diplomatic Service List as a ‘First Secretary’. He was posted to Brazil in the early 1990s and was then based in Havana, Cuba, before returning to Whitehall in 2001. Planned operation: The arrests on Mr Sutcliffe and Miss Patel were made by police over the weekend . Scene: A neighbouring house belonging to a family from Hong Kong was also searched during the operation . Mr Sutcliffe's sister-in-law Jenny . described James's arrest as ‘lunacy’ and suggested the entire operation . was a ‘mix-up’. His brother Peter, 49, said it was ‘extraordinary’. Meanwhile, the East London home of Mrs Patel, 54, remained at the centre of a search today and officers could be seen digging in the garden. Her daughter Kuntal, who is believed to work in the City, remains in custody. Her younger sibling sister, Poonam, is a pharmacist. Both Mr Sutcliffe and Miss Patel were arrested on suspicion of offences under the Anti–terrorism, Crime and Security Act, a rarely used piece of legislation. A white Nissan Micra was taken away from the Stratford property on a low–loader and a skip in a house opposite was searched. Local councillor Ron Manley, has known the Patels for more than 20 years, said: ‘They are a very upstanding family. ‘Meena is a magistrate and used to work for a local authority, Kuntal works in the City and her younger daughter Poonam is a pharmacist. ‘They are a Hindu family and I've known the two girls since they were at primary school. They have always been very polite, very nice girls.’ Mrs Patel sits on the bench at Thames magistrates' court in east London, where she has at least five years' experience. She was recently involved in a local campaign to get neighbours to take part in a scheme to stop youths congregating on street corners. Action: A Met spokesman said public safety was 'a priority' and people in the area didn't appear to be at risk . Facebook friends of Kuntal Patel include . three people with the same name as the occupants of the neighbours to . the Sutcliffe family. Yesterday the Wong family, who are understood to have roots in Hong Kong, returned home after their house and garden had been searched before leaving again with suitcases. A relative, who lives a short distance away, said: ‘They didn't do anything wrong, but it's not nice for all the neighbours to see the police there. ‘It's over now, they're OK now.’ In a statement, the Met police said: A 19-year-old man was arrested on 25 January on suspicion of an offence under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. 'He has been bailed to return until April, pending further enquiries. 'A 36-year-old woman was arrested later on 26 January on suspicion of an offence under the Act. 'She remains in custody at an east London police station.' It added: 'Public safety is a priority and at this stage there is nothing to suggest members of the public in the immediate area are at risk.’","Diplomat Nicholas Sutcliffe's family home was raided by anti-terror police .

Reunited: An antique bear left at Bristol airport for a year is about to be finally returned after a public appeal . The mystery of a 100-year-old dog-eared teddy bear found abandoned in an airport departure lounge has finally been solved. Airport staff found the antique bear, which has one eye and a floppy ear, in a bag with a frayed black and white photo, dated March 1918, of him being cuddled by two children. Unlike Paddington Bear, the toy had no name tag but a message in faded ink on the back of the picture read: 'With dearest love and kisses to our darling Daddie from your loving little daughters Dora and Glyn.' Staff at Bristol Airport made a public appeal to try and trace the owner earlier this year but were unable to find any living relatives until a campaign by The Mature Times, a newspaper for the over 50s. Reader Robert Glyn Baker spotted the story and recognised the bear as a family heirloom he lost while travelling through the airport on his way to Cyprus. He said: 'I was stunned when I got a cutting of the Mature Times in the post and saw my bear on the front page. 'I thought it was lost forever, I was convinced it had been destroyed.' The bear was found in 2012 and staff spent 14 months trawling flight records to see if they could find any two passengers with the same names as those mentioned on the back of the picture. When they could not they appealed for help from the public and a number of experts stepped forward to help with the search. They were able to trace the date of the picture after they discovered a second message on the picture, which said: 'Taken on Baby's birthday March 4th 1918, one year and five-months-old.' But, despite tracing who the children were they were unable to find them. Heirloom: The bear was found in a bag with this frayed black and white photo, dated March 1918, of him being cuddled by two children . Message: Unlike Paddington Bear, the toy had no name tag but a message in faded ink on the back of the picture read: 'With dearest love and kisses to our darling Daddie from your loving little daughters Dora and Glyn' Robert spotted his bear - nicknamed 'Bristo' by staff - after his former wife sent him a cutting of the Mature Times front page from January. The gobsmacked dad-of-one, who is still in Cyprus, was so shocked when he realised his bear was still out there he immediately rang the paper to try and get him back. 'I'm an only child and my auntie Dora didn't have any children either so I am the only person that could have got the bear,' Robert said. 'My mum gave him a different nose, he has pads on his arms too. I think I gave him a rough time when I was a kid! 'It's the sentimental value really, my hands were so full with what I was carrying I thought I had left it in the toilet. I had so much with me, but like a fool I left it in the airport. 'I would love to have it back.' Inspired: A painting by Sandra Busby, inspired by the story of the Bristol Airport bear .","Bear was found in a bag in the departure lounge at Bristol Airport .

You can pick up a tablet for less than £30 these days, but very little separates one model from another. In a bid to create 'something different', an Ohio-based inventor decided to build his own, complete with touchscreen, USB ports, and apps. Called the PiPad, the 10.75-inch tablet is powered by a Raspberry Pi computer and runs on the Linux-based Raspian Operating system. Ohio-based inventor Michael Castor spent two weeks building the PiPad device, pictured. The 10.75-inch tablet is powered by a Raspberry Pi computer and runs on the Linux-based Raspbian operating system . Price (for parts): $350 (£210) Screen size: 10-inch . Dimensions: 10.75"" x 7.5"" x 1"" Operating system: Raspbian OS . Processor: Raspberry Pi B . Battery: 10,000mAh . This means it can run apps created for the Linux operating system. However, the DIY tablet doesn’t come cheap and all the individual parts will set you back around $350 (£210). 'It seems that every day a manufacturer comes out with a new tablet computer - thinner, lighter, faster, but it seems that they all look about the same and accomplish roughly the same things,’ sad ’ said designer Michael Castor. ‘When I set out to build my Raspberry Pi tablet I wanted something different. 'I wanted an all-in-one system that was usable, portable, and Linux based. Additionally, it had to look good.' The casing of the PiPad is made from Baltic birch plywood and carbon fibre. The casing of the PiPad is made from Baltic birch plywood, pictured, with a carbon fibre back. Castor used a CNC machine to shape the wood to the correct shape . The PiPad is fitted with a 10,000aMh battery, which Castor claims provides up to six hours run time. It also has USB and Ethernet ports, plus an audio jack, so Castor can watch videos and listen to music. A Bluetooth chip lets users connect a wireless mouse and keyboard .

A house husband and his investment banker wife are locked in an £11million divorce battle after a fierce holiday row proved the final straw for their marriage . Weng Choy and his breadwinner wife Lena Tan lived an opulent lifestyle during their 15-year marriage, enjoying homes in Hong Kong and Malaysia, a £1million wine collection and the ‘jewel in the crown’ of their marital assets, a £4.5million flat in Kensington, west London. Mr Choy, 56, filed for divorce in January 2012 after a row on New Year’s Eve while on a family holiday in Singapore. Battle: Lena Tan, left, and Wang Choy, right, are fighting over their £11million fortune after filing for divorce . He is asking the English courts – . renowned for their generosity in deciding divorce settlements – to hand . him a slice of the marital assets, which have been valued by lawyers at . £11million. Mr Choy, . who was also a banker, according to his lawyers, before quitting to care . for the couple’s two sons, claims he sacrificed his own career so that . his wife’s could flourish. But . Miss Tan, 54, a leading hedge fund manager who has worked in the City . as well as the Far East, is arguing that her husband has no right to . divorce her in the UK and has initiated her own proceedings in Malaysia. James . Turner QC, for Miss Tan, who is asking the Appeal Court to block the . English divorce bid, said that following a falling out in London in . September 2010, the couple’s marriage hit a crisis but had survived . until it ‘struck the rock of the row on New Year’s Eve 2011’. A . High Court family judge ruled in March last year that the husband had . been ‘habitually resident’ in London for at least a year before he filed . for divorce and so was entitled to end his marriage in the UK. However, . Mr Turner argued that, despite more than half of the couple’s wealth . being invested in Britain, the judge should not have allowed the divorce . to proceed. Home: The couple used Ms Tan's earnings as a hedge fund manager to buy a £4.5million flat in this building in Kensington without getting a mortgage . The court heard the couple fought on a family holiday in Singapore (pictured) during Christmas 2011/2012 . He insisted . that the husband’s home had remained in Hong Kong and that the marriage . had been intact until the fateful holiday row. ‘Married . family life between the parties continued to some degree at least,’ he . said, ‘and had Hong Kong as its centre, until a row took place between . the parties during the Christmas 2011, New Year 2012 period, following . which the husband came to England.’ Mr . Turner also said it was unfair that, after agreeing to pay £500,000 to . her husband from the proceeds of their wine collection, the wife had . also been ordered by the High Court to pay him a further £100,000 . towards his legal bill. Tim Bishop QC, for the husband, insisted that his home base had been in London since the 2010 argument. ‘When the centre of the husband’s interest ceased to be Hong Kong, London was the natural and obvious replacement,’ he said. The . Malaysian-born couple’s two children had both boarded at English . schools, he added. ‘The judge found that they had an international . marriage which involved them moving around the world following the . wife’s work. After the marriage broke down . . . the husband’s centre of interests ceased to be dictated by the wife’s working life.’ Mr Choy has obtained a British driving licence as well as a National Insurance number, he added. Hearing: The Court of Appeal, sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice, is set to rule on the pair's divorce . Lord . Justice Leveson, Lord Justice Aikens and Lady Justice Macur reserved . their judgment on the case and will give their ruling at a later date. n . A businessman asked his partner of 30 years whether she would stay on . as a housekeeper when he moved his new lover into their home, the High . Court heard yesterday. And . the man – worth more than £13million – could not understand why his . partner then ‘became aggressive through her lawyers’, a judge said. The request emerged yesterday as the woman was awarded a payout of more than £6million by Mr Justice Bodey. He said his judgment could be reported but said the couple, from London, could not be identified. ‘The husband installed the other woman – and her 12-year-old daughter – into the marital home,’ said the judge. ‘The husband told [his partner] he was not intending her to vacate and would she remain as some sort of housekeeper?’ He said she found the suggestion ‘very demeaning and upsetting’.","Lena Tan amassed £11million fortune as hedge fund manager and bought £4.5million Kensington mansion with husband Weng Choy .

Contract: Laura Kuenssberg is set to earn £200,000 as Newsnight's chief correspondent when she starts next month . Newsnight's new presenter has been offered a £200,000-a-year contract to lure her away from ITV, it has emerged. Laura Kuenssberg, a BBC veteran who is currently the business editor at ITV, is set to become Newsnight's chief correspondent next month. It was today reported that she would be earning a salary of £200,000 to appear on the programme, whose average audience has slipped in recent years to just 600,000 viewers. Her hefty salary - which could be an attempt to stop the star reporter defecting to Sky News - works out as 33p per viewer. The deal, which is said to have angered other BBC staff, comes after the Corporation has been widely criticised for the high salaries paid to executives and on-screen stars. And Newsnight has itself been embroiled in controversy after the show's editor was forced to quit in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The programme - which specialises in investigations and hard-hitting interviews - cancelled a programme exposing the former BBC star as a paedophile shortly after his death in 2011, and the next year it falsely accused Conservative peer Lord McAlpine of child abuse. Editor Peter Rippon resigned and was replaced by Guardian journalist Ian Katz, who has hired Ms Kuenssberg and a number of other presenters in a bid to refresh the 34-year-old show and boost its viewing figures. The new editor is thought to have brought a lighter touch to the programme with segments such as presenter Kirsty Wark dancing with 'zombies' on Halloween. However, he also found himself in hot water when he described Labour MP Rachel Reeves, a guest on the programme, as 'boring snoring' in a message which he accidentally publicised on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Tough: Newsnight's most popular and hard-hitting presenter Jeremy Paxman apparently earns £800,000 . Flagship show: Newsnight, which is edited by Ian Katz, left, and hosted by Jeremy Paxman, right, has seen its viewing figures fall over the past few years to around 600,000 from one million several years ago . Newsnight once attracted audiences of up to 1million on a regular basis, but its viewing figures have collapsed to an average of 600,000 over the past few years. Ms Kuenssberg's appointment as chief correspondent was announced in November, although she will not take up her post until next week. After the news of her £200,000 salary emerged, one BBC employee criticised the deal as 'completely over the top', telling The Sun: 'She's no big ticket name.' Jeremy Paxman, Newsnight's most popular presenter, is paid around £800,000, while the BBC has refused to release details of Mr Katz's pay. Twist: Kirsty Wark dancing with zombies is one of the gimmicks brought in by Mr Katz to boost interest . A spokesman for the Corporation said: 'Laura is widely admired as one of the best broadcasters in the country, with a wealth of experience as both a reporter and presenter. Her appointment is a key part of the renewal of Newsnight.' One reason for the lucrative contract could be to stop Ms Kuenssberg, 37, from being tempted by alternative offers - she is tipped as a leading candidate to replace Adam Boulton as political editor of Sky News. The presenter, who was born in Italy but grew up in Glasgow and went to the University of Edinburgh, first joined the BBC in 2000 and rose to be chief political correspondent for BBC News. She moved to ITV as business editor in September 2011.","Presenter, 37, is moving from ITV to BBC2's flagship news programme .

David Cameron today revealed his delight at being seen as just another ‘middle-aged slightly overweight man’ when out jogging as he expressed his regret at losing his privacy since becoming Prime Minister. In a deeply-personal interview he spoke of the ‘all encompassing’ life in Number 10, his struggle to find time for his family and being grilled by the Queen. He also ruled out taking part in Strictly Come Dancing, or any reality show which involved ‘taking my clothes off or eating insects’ but hinted at a desire to complete in the Great British Bake Off. David Cameron revealed he enjoys the anonymity of jogging through London parks . Appearing on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on BBC Radio 2 Mr Cameron admitted that he was surprised by the sudden loss of privacy when he took power in May 2010. ‘When you’re leader of the opposition as I was for five years you are in the public eye and running a political party but you still have a lot of privacy, you don’t have a lot of security. ‘So when I became prime minister, I suppose the first time you try and open the door of the car and you realise it weighs about five tonnes and its quite difficult to open… . ‘You suddenly realise: I can’t pop down to the newsagents anymore and buy a packet of bacon and a newspaper. That was the biggest shock actually in terms of the privacy.’ The PM revealed he felt at his most anonymous when exercising in parks around Westminster, when no-one seem to notice they are within feet of the man running the country. ‘I try. I go for a run once or twice a week around the parks or something,’ he said. BBC Radio 2 presenters Steve Wright (left) and Tim Smith talk to the Prime Minister about life in Number 10 . David Cameron revealed he has to prepare for his weekly grilling by the Queen because she expects him to know what is going on. They meet every Tuesday or Wednesday evening for an hour. While the Queen never actually tells him his time is up 'the conversation naturally comes to an end', he said. 'And you are very conscious as Prime Minister that I am her twelfth. She started with Winston Churchill, she’s hear it all before, and I think Prime Ministers find it very valuable to try and explain the difficult decisions and problems the country faces. 'You are in the presence of someone who has heard and seen all these problems before.' And he hinted that she made sure he was on top of everything. 'You have to make sure you are well informed too, if I can put it that way.' He said he does not wear a ‘disguise’ but instead tries to go running at ‘strange times of day’. He . added: ‘Actually the thing about the parks in London is its mostly full . of tourists who just see some middle-aged slightly overweight man . trotting past them and they just think it’s another one.’ Whatever the Prime Ministerial exercise regime involves, it is not dancing. Despite heaping praise on the BBC for ‘making the good popular and the popular good, with shows like Eastenders, he ruled out ever following in Vince Cable’s footsteps to take part in Strictly Come Dancing. ‘No, I don’t think so. I think my dancing is probably best done privately,’ he insisted. Asked if he would maybe prefer Great British Bake-Off, I’m A Celebrity or another reality show, he hinted at having his culinary talents judged by Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. ‘I think I am probably better cooking something than either taking my clothes off or eating insects,’ he said. A fan of Homeland, he was given the US series Elementary for Christmas, a New York-based remake of Sherlock Holmes starring Jonny Lee Miller. But he gets little chance to watch TV. ‘It’s certainly true that this job is all encompassing and you never take your eye off it. ‘If I go upstairs at the end of the day with the children you are still on the phone you are still contactable at any moment if there’s any decision that needs to be taken or anything difficult happening anywhere in the world. ‘I’m lucky I’ve got an amazing wife in Samantha and we absolutely love our life together, we are so proud of our children and we try and make time for each other and make sure at the end of the day we sit down and have something to eat and chat about what the children are up to and what’s she doing and what I’ve done and then like everybody else I guess half an hour of Silent Witness and then we’re both asleep.’ Mr Cameron says he tries to find time every night to eat with wife Samantha, to whom he dedicated a song after 18 years of marriage . He has previously boasted of being a fan of The Killers, The Smiths, Mumford and Sons, Emiliana Torrini and Florence and the Machine. But now David Cameron has revealed Brit Award-nominee Tom Odell is his latest favourite artist. The PM said: 'I don’t know who is going to win the Brit awards. I think Tom Odell has got a lovely voice. 'I have been married to Samantha for 18 years this year, she is an amazing woman, and I think his song grow old with me for old romantics like me is a good one.' During a series of quick fire questions, Mr Cameron refused to say who would be the next Prime Minister - 'Luckily I don’t get to choose' - or who he wants to be in coalition with next time, stressing he wants a Tory majority. 'I'm not looking for another coalition. I've done coalition; I've got the T-shirt,' he said. 'If people want more of the things that we've been able to do - getting the country back to work, cutting people's taxes, getting the economy moving, sorting out our schools, capping welfare, sorting out immigration...more Conservative MPs, a Conservative government, that's the way to deliver it.' Asked if he beleives his old friend Boris Johnson when he says he does not want to be Prime Minister, Mr Cameron replied: 'I have a very clear view about Boris – he is a talented mayor of London, a brilliant man and I think he’s got a lot more to give to public life. 'I wouldn’t set the bar on his ambitions.' Asked what sort of leader he is -  inclusive, easy-going, dictatorial, or instinctive - he replied: 'I hope a bit of all those things and not too much of any of them. The way I try to do this job is to build a strong team.' But he admitted it is difficult to focus on the long-term when faced with the day-to-day pressures of running the country. 'I’m not complaining about the media, that would be like a farmer complaining about the weather. 'There’s a lot of short-term pressures but you have got to try and keep your eyes on the horizon. 'The things you do now, where will that leave the country in the future.'","Prime Minister reveals the moment he realised he'd lost his privacy .

Millionaire property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz could be thrown out of his £50million Kensington mansion after a £183million grab on his assets by a failed Icelandic bank was sanctioned in court. His grand four-story property, which sits by the Royal Albert Hall, is one of London's most prestigious houses and was used as Harry Selfridge's home in the ITV show Mr Selfridge. Kaupthing Bank collapsed during the financial crisis of 2008, and had allowed Mr Tchenguiz to borrow £1.6billion from them before it went to the wall. Magnate: Property millionaire Robert Tchenguiz, pictured with former girlfriend Caprice and friend Patsy Kensit, could be thrown out of his £50m London mansion, it emerged today . Grandure: His beautiful home, which sits beside the Royal Albert Hall, is being pursued by liquidators representing the failed Icelandic bank Kaupthing. It was used in ITV drama 'Mr Selfridge' starring Jeremy Piven .

Last month liquidators successfully gained . an order from the Royal Court of Guernsey allowing them to take assets . from him, including his house, which was the former home of the Royal . College of Organists. His interests in BAE's Hampshire headquarters and a huge Leicestershire BT distribution centre could also be pursued. Mr . Tchenguiz has appealed against the ruling but laws on the Channel .

A decade ago Robert and his sibling Vincent were reportedly worth around £4.5billion but this has now dropped to an estimated £850million. Robbie, as he is known to friends, is married with two children and once had a relationship with model Caprice. He has gained a reputation for partying and when he turned 40 it was reported he splashed £100,000 on a Louis XIV-themed event and hired acrobats from the world famous Cirque du Soleil.

Aldi has been hailed as one of the major successes of the recession, with affluent shoppers heading to the budget supermarket in a bid to save money in tough times. But after the German retailer announced plans to set up in a genteel seaside town, residents vowed to keep it out - saying they would prefer a branch of middle-class favourite Waitrose. Frinton-on-Sea appeared on a list of 50 towns where Aldi wants to open a new store as it bids to win market share from Britain's big four supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. High street: Frinton-on-sea in Essex is known for its large number of independent shops and lack of chains . Spot the difference: Councillors say they would rather have a branch of Waitrose than Aldi . Councillors in the Essex town - which previously fought against the opening of its first pub - have reacted unhappily to the news, and say they will try to keep the budget store out. 'I will be surprised if they get a look-in,' said mayor Iris Johnson. 'There was a lot of opposition here to Tesco coming into Frinton and I am sure Aldi could see the same. 'I am not sure where they would find an appropriate site.' Another councillor, who did not want to be named, declared: 'We want something like a Waitrose here instead. 'Places like Aldi and Lidl are doing very well in some places because people are happy to pick up a bargain. But it is the lower end of the market.' Fight: Councillors in the Essex town previously fought against the opening of its first pub . Resort: Holidaymakers on the beach at Frinton, which is fighting to maintain its genteel reputation . The reaction from Frinton locals contrasts to nearby Clacton-on-Sea, where shoppers queued for hours when a branch of Aldi opened last October. Frinton, which has a population of 5,500, is known for its retirement homes and independent shops, and houses there regularly sell for more than £2million. The town has a long history of battling against change - in 2000, hundreds of people fought a passionate but unsuccessful campaign against Frinton's first ever pub, The Lock & Barrel. Those opposing the ale house had warned if it was to get the go-ahead, it would be 'the worst day in Frinton since the Luftwaffe blew the town up in 1944'. Retirees: A retirement home in Frinton, whose population is relatively elderly . Battle: Locals previously campaigned to stop the opening of the town's first pub, the Lock & Barrel . And in 2009, there was outrage at proposals from Network Rail to remove the town's iconic 'gates' - the manned level crossing - and replace it with an automated crossing. The town's deputy mayor at the time declared there could be fighting on the streets which would be 'reminiscent of the Poll Tax riots'. Aldi - which made revenues of nearly £4billion in 2012 - has asked landowners to submit plans of their sites as it identifies potential new locations. The retailer, which along with Lidl has grown in popularity during the economic slump, promises 'attractive commission packages' to landowners who agree to host supermarket branches.","Aldi places Frinton-on-Sea on list of towns where it wants to open a branch .

The plane (centre) was also used in a flypast over Buckingham Palace on the 60th anniversary of the war's end . Historian Andy Saunders said he was almost completely certain of the tyre's history. 'The tyre is almost certainly from the Wellington bomber that came down about 50 to 100 yards away from it,' he said. 'The plane broke up in the sea and they dredged quite a lot of it up.

The . ‘revolving-door’ culture came under fire after manager Rob Cooper . revealed he had been working full-time since last March despite a huge . redundancy payment.

Each charge took 30 minutes and gave the £16,000 car a range of 55 miles. The pair completed the trip in 12 hours - three-and-a-half days quicker than it took a BBC crew in an electric car in 2011. A standard diesel car which does 50mpg would have used around £50 of fuel - but it was free in the Nissan Leaf thanks to the growing network of complementary charging spots. Mr Peilow, 36, a satellite communications engineer from Southampton, said: ‘We wanted to drive to Edinburgh to put to bed the BBC’s four day trip of 2011. ‘Of course the point is that if you will have a Leaf as your daily driver, but the odd trip to see granny in Manchester is a piece of cake now. ‘The furthest we went between charges . was 53 miles, but the Leaf will happily do 80 miles.  We had absolutely . no drama and no range anxiety. ‘Everything worked so well, I . described the trip as mundane.

Newport Pagnell, Leicester Forest East, Tibshelf, Woolley Edge, Wetherby, Scotch Corner (quick test of new charger), Aston Hotel Darlington (a media stop), Hexham, Newton St Boswells and Edinburgh Castle, which was the final destination. If they were going to do the trip in 11 hours, they would have stopped only at Watford Gap, Tibshelf, Wetherby, Scotch Corner, Hexham and Newton St Boswells, before reaching Edinburgh. The Nissan Leaf, which is built in Sunderland, now costs from £16,000 with government subsidies. It has a range of 80 miles and, like other electric cars, it is Congestion Charge and tax-exempt. Mr Peilow now believes that with improving infrastructure and prices dropping, owning an electric car is becoming more sensible by the day. He added: ‘I have a plug-in hybrid and I do about 300 miles a week on electric only and it saves me £3,000 a year. ‘Robert has done over 36,000 miles in his Leaf and we met a chap in Newcastle who has done more than 50,000 miles. ‘An electric car now makes sense for a lot of people, it’s only sales reps and road warriors who do a lot of miles that it won’t suit, but I don’t mind stopping for a coffee.’ The charge spots were put in by Ecotricity and Charge Your Car and are free to use. Ecotricity now has charging spots at service stations on the M4, M1 and in a number of Ikea car parks.","Red Dwarf actor Robert Llewellyn completed the challenge with his friend .

Officials say Inyoman Bagiada, 45, of Indonesia fell overboard early Wednesday near the Yucatan Channel. Bagiada was a cook aboard the Celebrity Constellation. According to the Coast Guard, the cruise did not report Bagiada missing until eight hours after he fell overboard. The cruise line says a pair of shoes were found next to a deck railing, and a review of closed-circuit camera footage showed ‘a person going overboard.’ Man overboard: Celebrity Constellation cook Inyoman Bagiada, 45, of Indonesia, has been missing since early Wednesday morning after falling off a deck near the Yucatan Channel . Officials say the ship’s location at the time the person went overboard was then reported to the Coast Guard. The vessel was returning from Cozumel, Mexico, to Port Everglades after a five-day cruise. It resumed its journey once the Coast Guard launched a rescue cutter and an HC-130 maritime helicopter to look for the missing man, according to NBC News. The incident took place at around 2.30am in the area of the Yucatan Channel about 20 miles off Cuba. But it was not until about 10.30am that Bagiada was reported missing. The cook’s disappearance marks the sixth such incident in the last five weeks, the maritime law blog Cruise Law News reported. Celebrity and its sister company Royal Caribbean have lost four people overboard over the past couple of months. Most recently, a 65-year-old Canadian passenger went missing New Year's Day from Independence of the Seas, which sailed to the Cayman Islands. The Constellation, dubbed ‘Connie’, is a 965-foot ship with the capacity to house more than 2,100 passengers that made its debut in 2002 as the fourth and final vessel in Celebrity’s Millennium line. Search and rescue: The U.S. Coast Guard launched a rescue cutter and an HC-130 maritime helicopter (pictured) to look for the missing man . In a glowing review of Constellation posted on the popular site CruiseCritic, editor Dan Askin described ‘Connie’ as a popular yet quirky ship that has developed quite the following among well-off seafaring enthusiasts in their 40s. The ‘luxury-lite’ boat boasts a grand atrium, marble finishings, numerous restaurants dishing out sumptuous meals with white-glove service and a smattering of eccentric artworks. Askin, who gave the ship four and a half out of five stars, wrote that last April, Constellation underwent a thorough makeover, emerging from the drydock after 19 days with 66 additional cabins, Apple workstations, lounges, shops and an improved basketball court.","Celebrity Constellation cook Inyoman Bagiada, 45, of Indonesia, fell off deck near the Yucatan Channel .

Anelka faces a five match ban for performing Dieudonne’s ‘quenelle’ gesture – a hand and arm movement which some say is a reverse Nazi salute. More than half a million pounds in allegedly laundered cash has been found in the home of Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 47, (right)  the French comic  at the centre of the Nicolas Anelka (left) anti-Semitism scandal . Now police have revealed that a total of £660,000 in cash was found in Dieudonne’s house near Paris, and in the theatre he runs in the French capital. Dieudonne has been convicted six times for defamation, and is suspected of hiding his money   to avoid paying his fines. Official searches on Tuesday were sanctioned by a French magistrate investigating money laundering and false tax declarations.

Investigators also believe that Dieudonne has sent the equivalent of more than £380,000 in cash to Cameroon, where his extended family live, since 2009. And they allege that a production company owned by his wife, Noemie Montagne, bought one of his properties for £450,000 in cash, when he owed the government £740,000. But Diedonne’s lawyer, Jacques Verdier, said the French were involved in an ‘organised hunt for Dieudonne’. A French policeman stands guard outside the Theatre de la Main d'Or during a warranted police search on the premises in Paris . Mr Verdier said his client was by  no means anti-Semitic and ‘does not support the Third Reich.’ Anelka has been charged by the Football Association with making a gesture which is considered abusive or indecent – an offence which carries a minimum five-game ban. Last week, Anelka denied the charge and requested a personal hearing to defend his case. Dieudonne’s last visit to Britain was in 2010, when he appeared in front of a large of audience of mainly French expatriates at a London theatre. He argues that his act is full of risque humour about a range of minority groups, including black people and Muslims. Dieudonne, who was brought up as a Christian, said that one of the reasons Anelka is being made a scapegoat in Britain is because he is a black Muslim who drives a Ferrari. Uproar: Anelka's gesture, the quenelle, has caused conflict in the UK and France over whether it is racist .

An off-duty policeman is believed to . have stolen a Force car for showdown talks with his bosses before . crashing it into the entrance gate at his headquarters. The . 39-year-old officer allegedly took the vehicle without permission this . morning from outside a police station in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. He was later arrested at the Cheshire Constabulary Headquarters in Winsford, some 25 miles away. The tall green gates to the rear of the HQ were visibly crumpled today, after the officer reportedly drove the car into them, and the entrance was sealed off with police tape. He had reportedly gone to the HQ as he wanted to speak with senior police bosses. The alleged theft comes days after the same officer, named by the Liverpool Echo as PC Kevin Szabo, was at the centre of a six-hour stand-off at his home in Prestatyn, North Wales. PC Szabo, who lives in Prestatyn, but serves with Cheshire Police and is thought to be based at the Ellesmere Port station, was said to be involved in a 'disturbance' in which he barricaded himself inside a house.

'A 39-year-old man was arrested at Cheshire Constabulary Headquarters in Winsford for theft of a vehicle.' It was confirmed that the same officer had been involved in both the alleged theft of the car and the stand-off on Monday, and that he had recently been on sick leave from the force. 'Since September the Constabulary has . been supporting an officer from the Ellesmere Port area who has been . absent through ill health,' said Deputy .

Unseen footage from the Channel 4 reality series Benefits Street could be played in court as one star of the show goes on trial accused of assaulting a police officer. Lawyers for Charlene Wilson have asked Channel 4 to release the cut material to be played as part of her defence at a forthcoming hearing in Birmingham. Wilson, 29, who has accused the documentary's producers of duping her into taking part, was arrested last summer for allegedly assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. On trial: Lawyers for Charlene Wilson have asked . Channel 4 to release the cut material to be played as part of her . defence at a forthcoming hearing in Birmingham where she is charged with . assaulting a duty police officer . Appearing at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, Wilson was supported by other residents from James Turner Street in Winson Green including Samora 'Black Dee' Roberts and Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly. At one point the defendant during the brief hearing she turned to her friends and smiled as she sat in the dock. One of the mother-of-three’s supporters in the public gallery was overheard to say 'ridiculous' as the trial was adjourned until April. The hearing was put back because of the need for the film footage and a lack of time after an earlier trial had run for several hours, and because a police witness would not be available to appear while he was away on a course. Support: Appearing at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court, Wilson was supported by other residents from James Turner Street in Winson Green including Samora 'Black Dee' Roberts, left, and Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly, right . Wykeham Garsia, for the defence, told the court the material would need to be obtained from Channel 4 and played at the trial. He said: 'We will need to play the film. I don’t think they would turn it around that quickly. 'In theory they should be able to reasonably speedily. 'They will obviously have it in their archives. 'I don’t know how long they keep films, I would imagine at least for a year or two.' The hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Friday was adjourned by the court clerk without the magistrates - who were deliberating a verdict in an earlier case - being present. Wilson was granted bail . Benefits Street star Fungi, who has gone into hiding since the explosive Channel 4 show first aired, fears he is dying. The father-of-three - real name James Clarke - is a self-confessed alcoholic and recovering drug addict. He admitted turning to substance abuse after suffering years of abuse when he was a child. The 44-year-old lived on James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, for four-and-a-half years before suffering a meltdown sparked by the stress of appearing on the programme. Fears for his health grew when producers admitted he had moved away from the area 'for personal reasons.' But in a heart-breaking interview, he revealed he believes he does not have long to live. 'I haven’t got long left, I’m dying. I am waiting for my benefits to go up because of my health,' he said. In a teaser for next week’s episode which aired on Monday night, . producers showed Fungi visiting the doctors before saying he might have . cancer. Channel 4 was plunged into controversy last week after it emerged Fungi had fled his home on Benefits Street suffering a 'meltdown'. Friends claimed that producers had bribed Fungi with beer to appear on the show - an allegation Channel 4 has strenuously denied. Chris Coughlan, for the prosecution, . told the court a lengthy adjournment was necessary because a police . witness had to attend a course. He . said: 'One of my officers won’t be available because he has an . extremely important course which lasts 11 weeks and has been booked for . months and months.' Mr Coughlan added: 'It’s part of his career. I’m in the court’s hands.' The hearing on Friday was adjourned by the court clerk without the magistrates - who were deliberating a verdict in an earlier case - being present. Wilson was granted unconditional bail ahead of the trial. She has previously claimed she was duped into appearing on the show. 'They told me it was about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn’t show any of that,' she said. 'If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. 'They tricked us.' A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'We have not received a request for footage in relation to this incident but if we do then appropriate procedure will be followed.' In a separate case Wilson has been charged with conspiracy to supply a Class A drug, crack cocaine, conspiracy to supply a Class B drug, cannabis, and possession of diamorphine. She was arrested last June along with Black Dee, 32, who faces charges of conspiracy to supply a Class A drug, conspiracy to supply a Class B drug, possession of a Class A drug and possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate. They were among seven people held in police raids - all but one of whom live in the street.

The tomb of Sir Roger Mortimer's daughter Blanche, who died in 1347, has been unearthed at a Herefordshire church . The remains of the daughter of 14th century traitor Sir Roger Mortimer are believed to have been discovered in a village church. Sir Roger overthrew King Edward II in 1327 and reigned for three years before being overthrown by Edward’s eldest son Edward III and executed for treason aged 43. The tomb of his daughter Blanche, who died at the age of 31 in 1347, has now been unearthed at St Bartholomew’s Church in the Herefordshire village of Much Marcle during work to restore and repair the monuments of noblemen and women buried there. Conservator of sculpture Michael Eastham, stumbled on a lead-lined coffin, which was placed in the church 667 years ago, in October last year during the £500,000 restoration project. Mr Eastham has been working on the Grandison Memorial in the church for nearly two years but was taken aback when he discovered a coffin jammed inside the tomb-chest. The tomb is crowned by an effigy of Blanche and is regarded as one of the finest in the country. Historians have always believed the bodies of those being honoured by the memorials were buried deep underground and the monuments themselves were either empty or filled with rubble to support the ornate effigies carved in stone on top. Mr Eastham said: 'We could not work out what it was when we first took the stone panels from the front of the memorial. 'We thought it might be a layer of slate but as we explored further we realised it was a lead coffin. 'It’s the first time in more than 30 years as a conservator that this has ever happened.' The remains underwent an endoscopic examination.

The tomb was discovered at St Bartholomew's Church (pictured) in the Herefordshire village of Much Marcle . The Reverend Howard Mayell, vicar for the . parish, added: 'We kept the discovery under wraps until we had carried . out tests and made her secure again. 'There wasn’t much left in the coffin, so we can’t be absolutely certain it is Blanche but we believe the remains are hers. 'We are quite overwhelmed by the idea Blanche is still in the church.' A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Hereford said: 'There are thousands of these monuments in churches around Britain. Mr Eastham has been working on the Grandison Memorial in the church for nearly two years but was taken aback when he discovered a coffin jammed inside the tomb-chest . 'Historians have always believed these . monuments are in fact empty and the bodies of the people they are . dedicated to are buried nearby or under the church. 'This . discovery challenges that long held view and it could mean that . hundreds more monuments actually do contain the remains of people buried . hundreds of years ago.' Blanche’s . tomb, which is located within the chancel, includes an effigy which has . been described by experts as 'strikingly beautiful'. Sir Roger Mortimer overthrew King Edward II (above) in 1327 and reigned for three years before being overthrown by Edward's eldest son Edward III and executed for treason . A spokesman for English Heritage said: 'It is astonishing to find a coffin within a tomb. Usually the tomb chest is empty, with the body buried beneath. 'The coffin is complete, irregular in shape like a lead shroud, and has a number of small holes in it. 'The decision was eventually taken that the coffin should not be opened, both on grounds of best archaeological practice and the Church of England policy that human remains should be disturbed as little as possible.' Blanche was the wife of Sir Peter Grandison and despite her father’s infamy she was wealthy and considered the lady of the manor until her death. He husband’s tomb lies in Hereford Cathedral. Sir Roger Mortimer was the 1st Earl of March who was the second cousin twice removed of Edward II. He amassed fortune after gaining many estates in the Welsh Marches in Ireland following his marriage to wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville. In November 1316 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland but was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 for leading the lords in a revolt against King Edward II in what became known as the Despenser War. He escaped to France where he was joined by Edward’s queen consort Isabella, who he took as his mistress. He and Isabella invaded England and successfully overthrew Edward II before being the country’s de factor ruler for three years. In 1330 Edward’s son overthrew him and he was famously executed by hanging at Tyburn in London. History has often referred to Sir Roger as ‘The Greatest Traitor’ on account of his repeated rebellions against the monarchy.

A British magazine has apologised and pulled their February issue after seemingly copying a distinctive front page tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings. The cover of Bath Magazine’s February issue features dozens of running shoes arranged in a heart shape to promote the Somerset city’s upcoming half marathon. But the design is nearly identical to one used by the Boston Magazine to honor the three people killed and more than 250 injured when the U.S. race was targeted by terrorists. Insensitive: The Bath Magazine has provoked outrage with a front cover that copies the design of a tribute issue by Boston magazine commemorating those killed in 2013's terrorist atrocity .

Carlos Arredondo (left) and Jeff Bauman (right) were invited by President Barack Obama to hear his State of the Union address on Tuesday, January 29 . The cover - which featured real trainers used by runners in the doomed race - raised more than $125,000 for those injured by the atrocity last year. Boston Magazine editor Carly Carioli is now demanding its Bath counterpart make a ‘significant donation’ to the fund. In a scathing web message posted on its website addressed to The Bath Magazine he said: ‘Last spring, as we tried to figure out how best to honor the resilience of our city in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, we asked runners to lend us the shoes they wore in the race. ‘In turn, their shoes, and the cover we produced, helped us to raise over $125,000 for the One Fund, the charity established here to benefit those affected by the bombing. ‘You liked the shoes cover so much that you borrowed (others have used less charitable phrases) the concept for your February issue on the half marathon in Bath. ‘We can’t speak for the dozens of runners who donated their shoes to us for that image.

Accused: Brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left), who died in a shootout with police after the bombing, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) are both suspected of carrying out the atrocity . ‘We can’t speak for the runners who are preparing to run this April. ‘But we hope that if you were so bold as to borrow our idea, you will also borrow the spirit of that cover - and make a significant donation to the One Fund in the name of those who were unable to finish the race.’ At first the Bath Magazine tweeted an apology - but did not say whether it would make a donation to the fund. A message sent on Tuesday said: ‘We would like to make an unreserved apology for any upset or offence caused by our latest cover. This was clearly not our intention. ‘We are truly sorry and embarrassed for what has happened. We shall be looking into this immediately and post a full apology in due course.’ Americans took to Twitter to slam the stunt. Sarah Dugan from Massachusetts said: ‘What an amazingly insensitive ""apology"" I hope Mitch Feinberg [the photographer] holds you accountable for copyright infringement.’ S.I. Rosenbaum from Boston tweeted the Bath organisers and said: ‘Hey Bath, who died in your marathon?’ Responding to the online backlash, the magazine tweeted added: ‘We don’t mean to bring up bad memories, just supporting our runners in Bath.’ But it only served to provoke outrage from one Boston resident who said: ‘Boston Marathon killed three people and injured at least 264. ""Bad memories""? Are you KIDDING ME?’ Si Rosenbaum replied: ‘By ripping off a cover we made to honor the victims of the marathon bombing? Nice one.’ Condemnation was echoed on this side of the Atlantic by John Maggs, from Bristol, who said: ‘It’s inappropriate to copy a tribute to people who have died to advertise tourism.’ Gus Hoyt from Bristol added: ‘Will the Bath Magazine now face a boycott similar to Liverpool’s boycott of The Sun? For a cover and ‘justification’ like that, it’s due.’ The Bath Magazine eventually published an open letter of apology from publisher Steve Miklos to the Boston magazine on its website. It said: 'Late in the process of creating our front cover we were made aware of the Boston magazine cover, and while we were inspired by it, we realize we have made an error of judgment by not fully realising its connotations in the States. 'Our intention was to create a front cover that reflected the twin themes of the inclusive nature of the Bath Half marathon and Valentine, this being our February issue. So we had the idea to feature a heart on the cover but with a running theme coupled with the message on loving the Bath Half. We started to search for an image from the usual stock libraries, then we decided to create our own.' The letter stated that the magazine would be making a contribution to the Boston One Fund and asked the city to 'accept our apology from one community to another'. However, some considered this second apology offensive, too. Manda Raper wrote: 'I'm from Boston and honestly I don't believe this is a sincere apology. You're like a child who got got caught taking a cookie from the sweets jar. I know it's a business but next time be more considerate.' A final tweet on Wednesday afternoon from the magazine said that they would be pulling the edition and reprinting it with a different image on the front. 'Open letter to the Boston Magazine: . The Bath Magazine publisher Steve Miklos would like to offer his sincere apologies to anyone who found the similarity between our image and the Boston Magazine cover in any way upsetting, as clearly we did not wish to cause any offence. We are proud to be supporters of the Bath Half marathon, and indeed members of our staff are running in this year’s race.

We started to search for an image from the usual stock libraries, then we decided to create our own. We invited runners to lend their trainers for our photograph and interviewed them about their motives for running the half marathon. You can read some of these moving and inspirational tales inside the magazine. Mr Miklos said: 'Late in the process of creating our front cover we were made aware of the Boston Magazine cover, and while we were inspired by it, we realize we have made an error of judgment by not fully realising its connotations in the States.' 'On a personal note, I ran the half marathon last year during which time I met many runners, each with their own battle to fight and individually determined to finish. Some had suffered personal tragedies and were doing what they could to raise money and beat their own demons. 'I am running the Bath Half on March 2nd and as well as supporting many of our local charities, the magazine will be making a contribution to the Boston One Fund.'

Ruling: High Court Judge Mr Justice Hayden has given doctors authority to carry out a caesarean section on a 25-year-old pregnant woman who is suffering 'a profound psychotic episode' A High Court judge has given doctors authority to carry out a caesarean section on a pregnant woman who is suffering 'a profound psychotic episode'. The judge allowed an urgent application by the Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust for permission to carry out 'serious medical treatment' on the 25-year-old, who is pregnant with her first child and has a history of affective bipolar disorder. Doctors had asked that the caesarian section be performed after a rupture of the amniotic sac, putting both the mother and her child at risk of infection. Ordinarily in such circumstances doctors would induce labour, however, the woman had been unable to take all of her anti-psychotic medication due to her pregnancy, and had become  'highly agitated'. Medics believed she would be unable to co-operate should she be induced. Mr Justice Hayden also ruled it would be lawful and in the woman’s 'best interests' for hospital staff to ensure she does not leave the hospital at any stage until it is 'clinically appropriate' for her to be discharged. He directed that any physical restraint or force used on her should be the minimum necessary, and all reasonable steps should be taken to minimise her distress and ensure she retains 'the greatest dignity possible in all the circumstances'. Mr Justice Hayden, sitting in the Family Division of the High Court in London, said the woman, who can only be named as 'AA' for legal reasons, and her partner welcomed the pregnancy and they plainly had the support of her parents. In a ruling on Tuesday, the judge said AA was now at 38 weeks gestation but appeared unable 'to comprehend any aspect of her treatment'. She had been prescribed 'a battery of anti-psychotic medication' for her bipolar condition, and also had a history of substance and alcohol abuse, most likely linked to efforts to self-medicate, particularly in the early days of her illness. The judge said AA’s father, who had been with her throughout her 'long journey' of mental ill-health, had described her present condition as 'the worst he has seen'. The father told the court she was very agitated, 'violent and exhausted by lack of sleep'. On January 29, AA appeared at the Great Western Hospital, Swindon, Wiltshire, confused and disorientated after a suspected seizure. She was admitted to the hospital’s labour suite although, at the time of the High Court hearing, she had not gone into labour. The day after arriving at the hospital, she was detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 and remained 'highly agitated and largely unco-operative with almost every aspect of her obstetric care'. Because of her pregnancy, it was not possible to administer her full range of anti-psychotic medication or the required dose. Application: Doctors at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire, had the backing of the woman's family to carry out the caesarian, with her father describing them as 'fantastic' The judge said the dilemma for clinicians was that membranes, or amniotic sac had ruptured, giving rise to a significantly increased risk of both mother and unborn baby suffering infection before delivery. Her medical team were entirely clear that she would be unable to co-operate should labour be induced and that it would be in her best interests and the safest option to perform an elective (planned) caesarean under general anaesthetic. Her father said the doctors and nurses had been 'fantastic' and he supported them '100 per cent'. He had told the court his daughter had already moved intravenous lines on more than one occasion, the judge said. On the night before the court hearing, AA had become more distressed. She had run at a window and tried to get out, telling her father 'she wanted to go to heaven'. The judge said AA’s partner was in difficult circumstances and not always consistent or logical, but he believed he was saying that if AA 'were not suffering this profound psychotic episode... she would follow the recommendation of the doctors'. The judge ruled: 'In all the circumstances, therefore, it is perfectly clear that AA, at the moment, lacks capacity to take these crucial decisions, and that the case made by the Trust for elective caesarean is, as the official solicitor (appointed to safeguard AA’s best interests) observed, compelling. 'For the avoidance of doubt the official solicitor has supported every aspect of the Trust’s case.'","Doctors asked that the caesarian section be performed after the mother's amniotic sac ruptured, putting both her and her baby at risk of infection .

Whether matte, leather look or in a delicate pastel hue, nailpolish is rapidly becoming a cheap and chic way to score style points. But although its tempting to change your colour as often as you change your clothes, overdoing the lacquer can have disastrous consequences, as one London mother discovered. Two decades of repeatedly changing her polish left mother-of-two Subhain, 31, with unsightly yellowed, crumbling nails and, worse, without any at all on three toes. Ruined: Subhain's toenails have been destroyed by her penchant for changing her polish every day . Embarrassing: Subhain says she is too young to have crumbling toenails . As a result, the stay-at-home mother is unable to wear open-toed shoes, while the painful exposed skin on three of her toes mean heels are also out of the question. 'It might seem like a little thing but to me it's a big thing,' she explained, adding: 'It really gets me down.' Her problems began two years ago, when she began to notice a dryness and yellowing. 'They just started to go really weak and . crumble off,' she adds. A polish habit that had lasted for two decades was to blame, made worse by her insistence on removing and replacing the varnish almost every day. From . a very young age, I've been painting my toenails and I've been using . nailpolish remover on them. 'Nailvarnish remover can cause problems . because it contains a chemical called acetone which saps the moisture . from the nails,' explains leading dermatologist, Dr Sam Bunting. 'It leaves them weak, brittle and dry and with this sort of flaking, crumbling . problem.' At first Subhain attempted to combat the damage alone. 'They were going very yellow and very . weak,' she explains. 'I stopped painting them for a while but when I started again, they began to crumble off.' Unable to solve the problem, she went to the doctors and asked to have the worst-affected toenails removed. 'They had a sort of plier thing to remove . the nails with,' she remembers. 'I was really happy because I thought they would grow . back baby-fresh, brand new...' Solution: Subhain has to use false toenails when she wants to wear open-toed sandals (right) Custom made: Subhain's false toenails have been made especially for her but only stay on for a week . When, a year after having the toenails removed, she returned to the doctor to find out why they weren't growing back, she had an unpleasant surprise in store. 'She said they're never growing back,' says Subhain. 'I said ""no one told me they wouldn't grow back"" and I was totally devastated and it looks disgusting. Getting my nails removed, that's my biggest regret.' Despite trying everything from false nails to painting polish directly onto the nailbed, Subhain is yet to find a solution and complains that finding footwear is impossible. Her lack of toenails has also had a huge impact on her confidence. 'I've seen people in their 60s, 70s and 80s with lovely nails,' she adds. 'I'm too young to have no toenails.' But she has no choice. According to Dr Bunting, her nails will never grow back so the only option is custom made prosthetic nails. For Subhain, the cost of pretty toenails has proved heavier than she could ever have imagined. Subhain appears on Extreme Beauty Disasters, Thursday at 8pm on TLC .","Mother-of-two Subhain, 31, changed her polish daily for 20 years .

Sophie Holmes, 22, has overcome the debilitating illness to realise her dream of working in fitness. She believes pushing herself physically has helped her manage her cystic fibrosis. Sophie Holmes (right) overcame cystic fibrosis to set up a personal training business with sister, Anna (left) The condition can cause major lung damage and digestive problems, with the average life expectancy for sufferers being just 40 years. Ms Holmes’ current fitness is a huge turn around as just three years ago she spent three weeks in hospital critically ill after her lung capacity dropped to 60 per cent. Against the odds she pulled through, but her near death experience made her realise she needed to take her health more seriously. ‘Lying in a hospital bed with an intravenous line in my arm feeding me antibiotics, I made a vow to myself to make my health a priority,’ she said. ‘Seeing my health deteriorate so quickly was frightening to me. I knew I had to do something to make sure I was never ill like this again.’ In the days and weeks that followed she researched ways to combine her health with her job, and decided to become a personal trainer. Ms Holmes made the decision to become a personal trainer when she was in hospital seriously ill. She says her illness, which was caused by cystic fibrosis, made her realise she needed to start putting her health first . Ms Holmes said: 'Lying in a hospital bed with an intravenous line in my arm feeding me antibiotics, I made a vow to myself to make my health a priority' She said: ‘I thought that being a personal trainer would be a great way to make my health my life. ‘It would be my job to look after my health, so I wouldn’t have any excuses to not take care of myself.’ Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus. Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive. As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections. The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat the infections. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus. For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene. In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition. About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis. As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically. Life expectancy remains in the 40s. Source: NHS Choices . Ms Holmes turned to her elder sister, Anna Holmes, 24, for support with her dream. Amazingly, Anna quit her job at a children’s nursery to help her sister reach her goal. 'She was my best friend and I knew I’d find it hard with my illness,’ says Ms Holmes. ‘I thought having Anna’s support would spur me on. I knew there was no turning back when she said let’s do it together.’ Together the sisters trained to become personal trainers with Premier Training International, and now they run their own business, Southend-on-Sea based Holmes Sisters Personal Training - and are making thousands a year. Growing up, Ms Holmes would always take part in sports and enjoyed tennis, hockey and netball at school, alongside managing her illness with daily physiotherapy and medication. But in 2011, when she was just 19, she became critically ill after her lungs filled with mucus. ‘It came out of the blue and was absolutely terrifying,’ says Ms Holmes. ‘Before being admitted, I’d been active as usual, riding my horse Otis and going to the gym. ‘But I was having difficulty breathing and went to the GP, and then discovered the CF, which until then I’d always held at bay, had taken a huge turn for the worse.’ She was rushed to hospital and spent three week hooked up to a heart monitor, being drip fed antibiotics to clear her lungs. While in hospital, she lost a stone in weight, dropping to just eight stone. While lying in bed at the Royal . Brompton Hospital she made a vow to do everything she could to improve . her health, and live a long and fulfilling life. She . said: ‘Being in hospital was horrible. I felt so weak and I was . terrified cystic fibrosis was going to get the better of me. ‘I knew I never wanted to feel like this again, so I stopped moping in self-pity and did something about it. Ms Holmes (left) believes her physical fitness has helped her to avoid becoming unwell again. She hopes it will help her to live a long and fulfilling life despite her illness . ‘Cardiovascular exercise can help CF sufferers, and I wanted to make it a fundamental part of my life to give myself the best shot.’ Now, after qualifying in May 2013 as a personal trainer, she has set up her own business with her sister and the pair help others reach their fitness goals every day. She says: ‘I’m determined to not let . cystic fibrosis stop me from pursuing my dreams. With the help and . support of my sister, I really feel as though I’ve been able to achieve . my goals and hope I can others achieve theirs. Ms Holmes said: 'You can do anything when you put your mind to it. Although my illness is serious, I don't believe it has to define me as a person, and now look how far I have come' ‘I couldn’t have done it without Anna, she supported me the whole way and helped me train when I was feeling low. She’s the best sister I could have asked for.’ ‘You can do anything when you put your mind to it. Although my illness is serious, I don’t believe it has to define me as a person, and now look how far I have come. ‘People who suffer from cystic fibrosis shouldn’t let it hold them back. Now I want to inspire others to reach their potential and beyond.’","Sophie Holmes became very ill when she was just 19 - her lung capacity dropped to just 60% and she spent three weeks in hospital .

From the invention of the telephone to the bicycle and even the steam ship, the Victorian period saw a mini revolution in the field of science and technology. But of all the new gadgets invented during her reign, it was the camera that delighted Queen Victoria the most. By the time she died in 1901, the UK's first modern monarch had amassed a huge collection of more than 20,000 images that included everything from favourite landscapes to early war photography and touching snaps of pets, friends and children. Family portrait: Queen Victoria and five of her children in an intimate snap taken by Roger Fenton in 1854 . The Royal Family at home: An 1857 portrait of the Royal Family taken by Leonida Caldesi in 1857 . Now some of the rarely seen photos from her archive are to be included in a fascinating new exhibition that documents Queen Victoria's passion for photography and offers a glimpse of the Royals' family photo album. Although most of the photos remain in the Windsor Castle archive, 200 royal photos will appear at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, including many by early greats such as Roger Fenton,  Leonida Caldesi and William Edward Kilburn. Among them is a touching family portrait featuring Queen Victoria and five of her nine children; the Princess Royal, the Prince of Wales, Princess Alice, Princess Helena and Prince Alfred, taken in January 1852. More show the Queen relaxing at Balmoral, spending time with her husband, Prince Albert, or posing for formal portraits during her widowhood. Carefree childhood: Princesses Helena and Louise pictured playing in the garden by Roger Fenton in 1856 . A Queen remembered: Victoria with Prince Albert in 1841 (left) and the Diamond Jubilee portrait of 1893 . Not amused: Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught seems less than thrilled to be starring in this Caldesi photo . Other members of the Royal family also appear, among them Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, Queen Victoria's seventh child, and her consort, Prince Albert, both of whom appear in official photos. Another, more intimate snap shows Princesses Helena and Louise in matching tartan ensembles in the garden at Balmoral during a summer jaunt. But although family photos dominate, the Queen's interest in photography wasn't limited to pictures of her husband and children. Photos of some of the Royal palaces, among them Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace, appear as do snaps documenting some of the most important events of the Victorian period. One, by William Henry Fox Talbot, shows Nelson's Column under construction in Trafalgar Square in 1844, while another chronicles the launch of the pioneering steamship, the Great Eastern, under the watchful eye of its designer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Favourite palace: This photo, dating from the 1880s, shows the Round Tower at Windsor Castle . Pioneer: This shot of Nelson's Column was taken by William Henry Fox Talbot, the inventor of the camera . Poignantly, another, snapped by court favourite Roger Fenton, shows the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. Considered one of the first war photographers, Fenton travelled to the Crimea under the patronage of Prince Albert and returned with 350 images, among them harrowing shots showing the carnage created by the Siege of Sevastopol and the Battle of Balaclava. His famous photo, The Valley of Death, depicting the spot where the Light Brigade met its end is part of Victoria's collection, along with others documenting events such as the Indian Mutiny from around the Empire. Although a keen collector, Queen Victoria never took any photographs of her own, although her children all embraced the medium. But although she chose not to get involved in creating her own images, her penchant for collecting photos, as the new exhibition makes plain, helped preserve some of the most striking depictions of the Victorian period for future generations to enjoy. A Royal Passion: Queen Victoria and Photography opens at the Getty Center in Los Angeles on 4th February. See getty.edu for more information . Innovation: Isambard Kingdom Brunel watching the launch of the steamship, Great Eastern, in 1857 . Valley of the Shadow of Death: The cannonball littered aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade, 1855 . From the Siege of Sevastopol to the Charge of the Light Brigade, Roger Fenton's striking shots taken in the Crimea are among the first war photographs ever taken. So who was the world's first war photographer? Born into a wealthy Lancashire family, Fenton was the fourth of seven children. He graduated with a degree in English, maths, Greek and Latin from Oxford University in 1840 and planned to study law before giving it up in favour of fine art. After stints in Paris, in the studio of Paul Delaroche and at the Louvre, he returned to London just in time for the Great Exhibition of 1851 where he discovered photography. Taught by early pioneer, Gustave Le Grey, within a year, Fenton was exhibiting his work nationwide and across Europe, and in 1853, helped found what would become the Royal Photographic Society under the patronage of Prince Albert. But it wasn't until war broke out in October 1853 between the British, Ottoman and French Empires on one side, and the Russian Empire on the other, that the photos that would define him in later years were taken. Encouraged by Prince Albert, he travelled to the Crimea, ostensibly to create photographs that would swing public opinion in favour of the unpopular war and counteract the critical reports being sent home by The Times' William Howard Russell. Based in the Crimea for just under 18 months, the 350 images he took are among the most enduring portraits of the Crimean War but did little to counter the negative public reaction. Much to his annoyance, when they went on sale following his return, the prints proved just as unpopular as the war itself with the paying public. His later career was spent travelling the length and breadth of the UK, creating stunning landscape photographs that proved far more commercially successful. In 1859, at his home in Potter's Bar in Hertfordshire, Fenton died after a week-long illness. He was just 50 years old.","New exhibition includes 200 rare images from the Royal Archive .

Amy had to do what she describes as the 'walk of shame' past all of the customers sitting in the rollercoaster ready to ride. Mortified, she decided to turn her life around.

She said: 'The very next day I joined a slimming club. It was the first time I’d been weighed since I was 16 year old - it was a bit of shock to be told I’d reached 17st 6lb. I hadn’t realised quite how overweight I’d become. Amy, picture before she lost weight, second from right in the green dress, on a night out with friends . 'I went home that night and threw out all the processed foods. I still made the boys their healthy square meals, but when making my own food I was sure to follow the healthy eating plan which had been set by the slimming club. 'I began buying fresh ingredients and learned to cook healthy things for the family. If I made a spaghetti bolognese I made it from scratch rather than just getting sauce from a jar. I came to enjoy cooking - it was something I could do with my boys too.'

At the gym I was always very conscious that my skin was wobbling around. I tried to wear clothes that were one size too small to stop my skin moving around too much. It was very uncomfortable.' In July 2013, Mrs Beveridge underwent an NHS-funded operation to remove the excess skin. She said: 'The surgeon removed 5.5lb of skin. Once it had gone, I felt as if I had reached an amazing goal. I feel absolutely amazing. 'I’m so much happier and more confident now. I know Douglas is very proud of me and happy with the way I look.

He had then set up a private security business, and been sent to work in Africa where he had seen for the first time the incredible poverty of people, and especially children, and had returned to Austria a changed man. The money he stole was being transported across Vienna before Christmas in a security van from the firm Loomis.

He was in the province to celebrate Christmas with his family, and he had already started shoving bundles of money through the letterboxes as anonymous donations to the needy. He told police he had however only given away a fraction of the cash, as he wanted to give the bulk of it to orphans in Africa.

The pair's lawyer Werner Tomanek confirmed he had often donated to charity and helped people in need. He said: 'He wanted to send the money to Africa in a container full of cheap electronic items. He was keeping it in the attic until he got it organised. 'He told the family that the cases were full of old documents.

A rhino horn worth more than £160,000 has been stolen by thieves who raided the home of Lord of the Dance creator Michael Flatley. The Irish star was playing computer games with his wife Niamh and their son Michael when their home Castlehyde, Ireland, overlooking the River Blackwater was invaded. Burglars are thought to have severed the horn - valued at £164,000 or 200,000 euros - from the stuffed rhino's head mounted on the wall in a safari room at the sprawling mansion, north of Cork. Targeted: Lord of the Dance star Michael Flatley and his wife Niamh were at home at Castlehyde, pictured, when a gang of thieves invaded, stealing the rhino horn valued at £164,000 or 200,000 euros . Mr Flatley raised the alarm after hearing the intruders and is understood to have tried to give chase in his car, but the gang escaped. The Gardai, the Irish police force, said the burglary was reported at 6.20pm on Monday. No one was injured and no arrests have been made. A source told The Daily Express: 'Michael and his wife were extremely distressed. A notorious traveller gang are suspected of carrying out this raid.' The gang has made a lucrative business out of targeting museums, country estates, auction rooms, galleries and collectors for rhino horns. Illegal dealers can sell the horns for up to £39,000-a-kilo on the black market. Black market: Illegal dealers can make around £39,000-a-kilo selling rhino horns . In Asia rhino horn is prized in traditional medicine despite serious health risks from the arsenic used to preserve older specimens. There have been a spate of thefts in recent years. One gang targeted a special storage unit used by the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin last year, escaping with four horns, which had been removed from the public eye for fear of thieves striking. Policing agency Europol issued a threat notice relating to an Irish traveller gang, dubbed the Rathkeale Rovers. The organisation believes the gang are behind a string of similar robberies across Europe. Gardai officers are scouring CCTV recovered from the Flatley mansion as part of their investigation. The Lord of the Dance creator has come under increasing criticism from animal rights campaigners, incensed that Mr Flatley would have an item, which has connotations of cruelty, on display at his home. Activist group Aran, said in an open letter: 'Whilst I am sure the . break-in was traumatic and stressful on you and your family’s part, has . it set in or even occurred to you that neither you nor those who stole . the horn are the rightful owners? 'The animals are literally on the brink of being wiped off the face of the planet.' Aran went on to suggest that if the horn is recovered, Mr Flatley should hand the item over to them to allow them to destroy it. Castlehyde was bought by Mr Flatley in 1999. The 19th century castle was the ancestral home of Ireland's first president Douglas Hyde. The star's website reveals the home stands in 150 acres of pasture and woodland and is worth an estimated 100 million euros.","Traveller gang is prime suspect after horn was swiped from star's home .

"PUBLISHED: . 04:15 EST, 28 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:28 EST, 28 January 2014 . Captured: Dionisio Loya Plancarte - one of the founders of the Knights Templar drug cartel known as 'The Uncle' - has been arrested . Mexico has legalized the country's growing vigilante groups as security forces revealed the capture of one of the four top leaders of the Knights Templar drug cartel. Thousands of Mexicans across the country have joined the vigilante 'self-defense' groups to fight the drug cartels' 'reign of terror' over civilians. The government yesterday announced it had reached an agreement with the vigilante group leaders to incorporate the armed civilian groups into old and largely forgotten quasi-military units called the Rural Defense Corps. Vigilante groups estimate their numbers at 20,000 men under arms. It comes as soldiers and . police arrested one of the cartel's top leaders, Dionicio Loya . Plancarte, alias 'El Tio' or The Uncle. The twin announcements may help the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto find a way out of an embarrassing situation in the western state of Michoacan, where vigilantes began rising up last February against the Knights Templar reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the abuses. 'The self-defense forces will become institutionalized, when they are integrated into the Rural Defense Corps,' the Interior Department said in a statement. Police and soldiers already largely tolerate, and in some cases even work with, the vigilantes, many of whom are armed with assault rifles that civilians are not allowed to carry. Vigilante leaders will have to submit a list of their members to the Defense Department, and the army will apparently oversee the groups, which the government said 'will be temporary'. They will be allowed to keep their weapons as long as they register them with the army. Scroll down for video . Mexican vigilantes pictured in the village of Paracuaro in Michoacan state, an impoverished agricultural state, where they have been battling drug cartel the Knights Templar . Stand off: Vigilantes stand at a checkpoint in Mugica near Apatzingan in Michoacan . The military will give the groups 'all . the means necessary for communications, operations and movement,' according to the agreement. The vigilante leaders, who include farmers, ranchers and some professionals, gathered on Monday to discuss the agreement, but it was not yet clear for them what it would imply. It wasn't known if the army would offer anyone salaries. Misael Gonzalez, a leader of the self-defense force in the town of Coalcoman, said leaders had accepted the government proposal. But the nuts-and-bolts 'are still not well defined', he added. 'We won't start working on the mechanisms until tomorrow.' Vigilante leader Hipolito Mora said in a television interview that the agreement also allows those who qualify to join local police forces. A member of the community police points a weapon at a deceased member of the Knights Templar cartel after a clash near the village of Paracuaro in Michoacan state . Vigilantes stand guard after hearing rumours of a possible ambush in Tierra Caliente, Michoacan . 'The majority of us want to get into . the police ... I never imagined myself dressed as a policeman, but the . situation is driving me to put on a uniform.' Latin . America has been bruised by experiences with quasi-military forces, . with such tolerated or legally recognized groups being blamed for rights . abuses in Guatemala and Colombia in the past. While the cartel may be on its way out, 'there shouldn't be abuses by those who come after, there shouldn't be what we would call a witch hunt; there should be reconciliation', said the Rev. Javier Cortes, part of a team of priests in the Roman Catholic diocese of Apatzingan who have publicly denounced abuses by the Knights Templar. The arrest of one of the cartel's top leaders, Dionicio Loya Plancarte known as 'The Uncle', is a big step in the fight against the drug lords. Vigilantes, who have been fighting the drug cartel across swathes of the failing Michoacan state, are pictured in the town of Nueva Italia after seizing control . National Public Safety System secretary Monte Rubido said the feared cartel leader was arrested without a shot being fired. He . said federal forces found Loya Plancarte in Morelia, the capital of . Michoacan, 'hiding in a closet' and accompanied only by 16-year-old boy. The 58-year-old Loya . Plancarte had a 30-million peso ($2.25 million) reward on his head from . the Mexican government for drug, organized crime and money-laundering . charges. He was considered one of the country's three dozen most-wanted . drug lords in the late 2000s. Loya Plancarte got his nickname, 'The Uncle,' because he is believed to be the uncle of another top Knights Templar leader, Enrique Plancarte Solis. Loya . Plancarte joined Plancarte Solis and Servando Gomez in forming the . Knights Templar after the purported death of Nazario Moreno. Armed: The vigilantes, pictured in Paracuaro, will now be incorporated into quasi-military units and fight alongside the police against the drug cartels . A . local journalist from Michoacan recounted watching when Loya Plancarte . led a sort of pilgrimage to a shrine erected to Nazario Moreno and had . his assistants hand out 500-peso ($37) bills to people who attended. The . Knights Templar ruled many parts of Michoacan with an iron fist, . demanding extortion payments from businesses, farmers and workers, but . the self-defense groups have gained ground against the cartel in recent . months. Federal police and army troops were dispatched to bring peace to the troubled region, but the vigilantes have demanded the arrest of the cartel's major leaders before they lay down their guns. Ramon Contreras, an activist in the vigilante movement from the town of La Ruana, which was the first to rise up against the Knights Templar, said the arrest 'means a lot' to the vigilantes, but added that they won't rest until they see all the top bosses arrested. Contreras voiced a common belief that the man who founded the cartel under the name La Familia Michoacana, Nazario Moreno, alias 'El Chayo', is still alive, despite the government's statement in 2010 that he had been killed in a shootout with federal forces. 'He's still alive; there's proof he's still alive,' Contreras said.","Around 20,000 Mexicans have joined vigilante groups to fight the drug cartels' 'reign of terror' over civilians .

Former Rangers star Rino Gattuso put his life on the line against accusations of match fixing by declaring that he would kill himself in the street if found guilty. Italian prosecutors named the World Cup-winning midfielder as part of a wide-ranging investigation on Tuesday, providing evidence that the ex-AC Milan star had been contacted by a go-between working on behalf of a match-rigging gang.

His . home was raided as part of a widespread swoop by Operation Last Bet, . including the arrest of four men — among them Francesco Bazzani. The . report issued yesterday shows 13 texts from Bazzani to Gattuso, as well . as a number to former Lazio player Cristian Brocchi. Prosecutor . Roberto di Martino said: ‘Gattuso and Brocchi were connected to the . case by the use of phone taps. We’ve made four arrests and 16 searches. Some of these searches have produced a positive outcome. We found notes . and notebooks whose contents were based on betting.’ Familiar face: Gattuso made 51 appearances during his time with Rangers, scoring five goals . But . Gattuso hit back, declaring: ‘The phone records show Bazzani sent me 13 . text messages. They will, therefore, also show I never replied to any . of them. This man knows half of Serie A, he came to the Milanello gates . like many hundreds of others. He was a  bookmaker in Bologna, but I . never talked about fixing games. Controversy: Juventus were relegated from Serie A in 2006 as a result of a match-fixing scandal . ‘Match-fixing . is just not part of who I am. I made some bets when it was still . allowed, but as soon as it was barred for professionals, I stopped. No . problem. ‘I am accused not of placing bets, but of fixing games, and I can’t understand how they can do that. ‘I . was in Naples, so only found out about the raid from my wife, after police took me in to sign some papers. I hope the . magistrate calls me in soon because I want to clarify my position. ‘I . had also been dragged into this affair two years ago. I am convinced . and fully aware of my innocence.

Jewish activists are pressing ahead with demands to pray at a contested Jerusalem holy site prompting potentially explosive clash with Muslims over the right to worship there . The Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif is one of the world's most contested religious locations because the 35 acre site has religious significance to both Jews and Muslims. According to Jewish tradition, it is the former site of Solomon's Temple, also known as the First Temple. Friction: Jewish activists have set their sights on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, prompting potentially explosive clash with Muslims over right to worship there . Its western flank contains the Wailing Wall and many Jews face the direction of the mount when praying. The same area is known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary). The location is important to Muslims as they believe it is where the Prophet travelled to before ascending to Heaven - Jews are banned from public worship there. For Palestinians, having their future capital in East Jerusalem is a fundamental element of any future state. Each week, hundreds of Jews visit the site of their destroyed temple, in the heart of the disputed capital’s Old City. Visitors are closely watched by both the . police and the Muslim religious officials of the Waqf who administer . the compound and keep an eye out to make sure no Jewish worship takes . place. Although they have police escorts they concoct elaborate ways to worship - some of them pretend to use a mobile phone to whisper forbidden prayers while others carry out banned bows by dropping coins and then bending to pick them up. Israeli border policemen load their weapons before patrolling at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City . Anyone wearing Jewish religious dress is generally kept away from . the Islamic holy tract. But now a group of Jewish activists are pressing for an end to the effective ban and their proposals are now being debated in the Israeli parliament, although a November committee hearing on the matter in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament dissolved into a shouting match between legislators and Arab Israeli lawmakers . The Temple Mount is a religious site found in the Old City of Jerusalem. According to Jewish tradition, it is the former site of Solomon's Temple, also known as the First Temple. Its western flank contains the Wailing Wall and many Jews face the direction of the mount when praying. The location is also important to Muslims, for whom the Temple Mount is where the Prophet traveled to before ascending to Heaven. Due to its importance to both religions, the site is one of the world's most contested religious locations. 'We’re looking for it to be divided between Jews and Muslims,' said Aviad Visoli, chairman of the Temple Mount Organizations, which claims 27 groups under its umbrella, reported the Washington Post. 'Today, Jews realize the Western Wall is not enough. They want to go to the real thing.' Wedged into the compound atop the ramparts of Jerusalem's walled Old City is al-Aqsa, originally erected 1,300 years ago, rebuilt in the 11th century after an earthquake and now Islam's third holiest site, and the 7th-century golden Dome of the Rock shrine, the oldest known Islamic monument. The plaza, from which the Prophet Mohammed is traditionally believed to have ascended into heaven, has an explosive past as a core issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel captured the area, along with the rest of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Middle East war. The Jewish state then annexed East Jerusalem as part of its capital in a move never recognised internationally. In 2000, Palestinian protests over a visit to the site by then Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon spiralled into deadly clashes and a five-year Palestinian uprising in which thousands died. Palestinian Religious Affairs Minister Mahmoud al-Habash said in May the conflict over the plaza 'may lead to an explosion' and that Palestinian authorities had complained to the United States and other Western intermediaries. Palestinian concerns have been heightened, however, by the fact that allies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are among the most vocal advocates of Jewish prayer at the site. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has denounced the Israeli visits as a part of a 'dangerous and an evil plot to demolish al-Aqsa' and build what he calls 'an alleged temple'. Dispute: The Temple Mount is a religious site found in the old city in East Jerusalem, covering an area of 35 acres . Also . in May, Israeli Housing Minister Uri Ariel, a Jewish settler in the . occupied West Bank who is from the far-right Jewish Home Party, said in a . largely tongue-in-cheek remark in parliament that he would 'definitely . be happy' to be assigned the job of rebuilding a new holy temple. While some Jewish zealots advocate such construction, such a project has never been on the agenda of Israeli governments. However, one member of Netanyahu's Likud party, legislator Tzipi Hotovely, visited the compound on the eve of her wedding earlier this year. She said her pilgrimage was symbolic of a historic yearning 'to rebuild on the ruins of Jerusalem'. A Likud colleague, Miri Regev, has said the site should be shared between Islam and Judaism so that Jews could pray there openly. Two Muslim women sit inside the Dome of the Rock mosque located in  the Al-Aqsa compound . Israeli police have barred further visits by another Likud lawmaker, Moshe Feiglin, an ultra-rightist who has been arrested in the past for what police said were attempts to worship on the plaza. Officials said they feared Feiglin's presence could stir violent Palestinian protests. Most of those campaigning for Jewish prayer in the compound represent a far-right minority, but many Muslims 'see a provocation, and blame the (Israeli) government, so we have a big problem"", said Israeli political scientist Yitzhak Reiter. Many Orthodox Jews once rejected the idea of praying in the compound, citing religious rules barring anyone not descended from one of the ancient priests from stepping on hallowed ground where holy scriptures were once kept. Israel has held Jewish prayers instead at the nearby Western Wall remnant of one of the ancient temples. But the idea of holding prayers inside the elevated compound as well has acquired more political significance over the years. Pro-settler . Israelis fear that yielding any control over the compound could lead to . a withdrawal from other occupied territory they see as a biblical . birthright and which Palestinians seek for a state. 'This isn't a religious issue at all"" Feiglin told Reuters in a recent interview. 'The question is who does the mount belong to, the Jews or the Arabs?' Friction at the site also looms over an Israeli plan to expand the concrete prayer plaza at the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites, to try and accommodate Jews seeking more liberal prayer services than most Orthodox custom permits. Currently Israel must deploy hundreds of police to prevent violence whenever angry ultra-Orthodox protesters confront women activists who hold monthly prayer sessions at the site. Muslims reject any Israeli construction in the area, though, and worry that any expansion of the Western Wall plaza may involve moving the footbridge at what is known as the Moghrabi Gate entrance to the compound and its Islamic holy sites.","The religious site is in the Old City of Jerusalem .

These days it's all about the holistic sex retreat, don't you know. Aimed at women who have lost touch with their sensuality, misplaced their mojo or are generally having a bit of a tough time locating their innermost confidence, these female-only residential getaways involve working with a range of trained therapists - including sexologists - to feel better about all aspects of your life, including your sex life. And Shh... - a luxury, no-boys-allowed haven held in a secret Dorset location - is Britain's first such sensuality retreat, launched by long-time friends Vikki van Someren and Lucy Arrowsmith, both 39, who created their own retreat after both being left somewhat 'dismantled' by experiences with The Hoffman Process of psychoanalysis. Shh..., an all-female sensuality retreat held in a secret Dorset location, is, according to founders, about 'celebrating and connecting with our femininity to live to our full potential' Described in the Sunday Times by Stephanie Theobold, who experienced the retreat, as 'Babington House meets Anais Nin meets rebranded new age', Shh...  is described by van Someren herself as 'a fresher, more sophisticated way of thinking about sensuality'. By taking part in a range of therapies including sensual healing, transformational breathing, reiki, massage, somatic experiencing, acupuncture, EFT, NLP and relationship . and sex counseling, guests are taught how to build . confidence, release anxiety, overcome trauma and explore their unique . sensual potential. The retreats - which cater for eight women at a time with eight therapists creating a completely bespoke experience for each - are based on three principles: . Sensuality: Unlocking our sensuality by connecting with and nurturing all of our . senses through a guided physical and emotional journey. Healing: Using therapeutic bodywork based therapy to help connect with our own innate healing capacity. Harmony: Celebrating and connecting with our femininity to live to our full potential. Using a range of therapies guests are taught how to build confidence, release anxiety, overcome trauma and explore their unique sensual potential . Speaking about their project, Arrowsmith and van Someren say: 'We want to shift the taboo . around women's sensuality and sexual awareness. 'Shhâ€¦ retreats offer women . the chance to experience, appreciate and celebrate their femininity . through developing an understanding of the relationship between . sensuality and self-confidence, creativity and the affects this has on . living a full and rich life. 'We combined our experience, passion, skills . and beliefs and have set ourselves a mission to organise unique . experiences in the form of retreats and events to harness the collective . power of women, and drive a new paradigm in the perception of . sensuality and the language associated with it.' The team call Shh... - which stands for 'sensual, healing harmony' - 'the 2014 destination for women looking to improve . their sensuality and for those seeking a fuller, healthier and sexier . life', explaining that the retreat offers 'unique, private, intensive retreats for women, hosted . by a team of female expert practitioners and guides'. 'Shh is the 2014 destination for women looking to improve their sensuality and for those seeking a fuller, healthier and sexier life' Arrowsmith - a former international swimmer, personal trainer and Sky Sport's TV presenter - and Vikki van Someren - a media director with 17 years in the publishing industry - joined forces on their current project having been inspired by each other's personal story. Founded in 1967, The Hoffman Process is a residential course designed to unlock negative energies and leave you better equipped to deal with life's difficulties. Created by health professionals, therapists, educational advisors, spiritual healers and others from the human potential movement, it is based on a variety of established teachings, from psychodynamic to cognitive. Retreats includes counselling workshops and various types of therapy to help people overcome stress and depression. Arrowsmith was one of the UK's leading fitness experts until she was diagnosed with ME in 2011. Then, combining her knowledge of sports science with her experience of traditional therapies, she developed a personal . programme to manage the side affects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which had sensual healing at its core. Van Someren herself turned to sensual healing as a way of overcoming childhood sexual abuse and a motorbike . accident in 2011 which damaged her pelvic organ nerve endings. She noticed profound improvements in her health and well-being, and quickly . set out to research how sensual healing experienced with other . therapies can improve health. The two women decided to launch their own retreats, the next of which will take place in March 2014, based on the proven principle that . 'bodywork and alternative therapies can have a profound affect on . removing the emotional scars of trauma'. They say: 'Trauma can come in many forms; . depressions, abandonment, infidelity, childhood bulling, . sexual/physical/emotional and mental abuse, bereavement and many more. 'The body acts as a host for emotional and physical wounds; these . scars play a significant part on our inability to remove emotional and . physical blockages. 'On Shh... retreats we work closely with the body to . identify and release the trauma that often-unknowingly affects us daily; . be it in our self-confidence, our relationships, our work and or . self-perception.' These female-only residential getaways involve working with a range of trained therapists - including sexologists - to feel better about all aspects of your life, including your sex life . 'It's not just about sex, by any means,' retreat spokesman Aimee told MailOnline. 'It's a really cutting edge combination of therapies used to heighten your senses and sexuality. 'It's about learning to live with all your . senses and come to terms with them and heighten them. It's very unique. 'We . work with each woman to see what they want and need. All therapists . work together so you get a very bespoke retreat, and although you work as a group . all treatments are unique to you. 'There's also a three-month aftercare . program supporting you on your journey back to real life. 'I think there will eventually be couples retreats further down the line, but right now it's designed by solely women for women.'","Britain's first sensuality retreat, Shh..., launched in secret Dorset location .

Hobbit hero Frodo Baggins' ring and sword are among an incredible $2.4 million archive of props from the blockbuster Lord Of The Rings films set to go on for sale. Dozens of the most iconic costumes and props from the smash hit trilogy are up for grabs including Gandalf's staff, Sauron's helmet and Gimli's battle axe. Fans of the films, adapted from the 1954 book by British author J.R.R. Tolkein, can also get their hands on prosthetic hobbit ears and feet. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO: . One Ring to rule them all: The Ring, left, which was used in the filming of Peter Jackson's epic could be a precious buy for one fan. They will be sold along with some prosthetic ears, right, which were worn by the cast . In character: Actors Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, left, and Sean Austin as Samwise Gamgee, right, show how the costumes looked in the final cut of the film . Amazingly the props have been compiled by a Lord of the Rings enthusiast who has spent more than 10 years scouring the world for authentic memorabilia. His incredible collection has been described by experts as the best in the world. The Lord Of The Rings films starred Elijah Wood as Frodo, a hobbit charged with destroying an evil ring to ensure the future of a mystical land called Middle Earth. Sir Ian McKellen played wizard Gandalf, Orlando Bloom starred as Elven archer Legolas and Christopher Lee was evil Saruman. Following the release of the first of the Peter Jackson-directed films in 2001 the anonymous US collector began amassing props and costumes from its production company. A scale model of a Ringwaraith, left, prosthetic feet, top right and a Mordor Orc full head, bottom right, show just how varied the collection is. The pieces were collected by a single Lord Of The Rings enthusiast . They spent four years filming the first trilogy during which time actors and film crew made life-long friendships. With this in mind, Jackson has insisted he only hired staff for the second set of films based around The Hobbit, if they were 'nice people'. Speaking at the Los Angeles premiere of the next Hobbit installment, The Desolation Of Smaug, the director said: 'We always wanted to cast nice people. Elven blade: This replica of Frodo's sword has dents from when Elijah Wood used it on set. It is the most expensive lot in the sale and could fetch $164,000 . Famous feet: The four hobbits of the story famously had prosthetics like the ones above, attached every morning before filming . Concerning Hobbits: The model of Sting, as given to Frodo by his uncle Bilbo, above, is one of the most expensive lots and is expected to fetch $164,000 . 'You do become part of our family in New Zealand. 'It's hard to film for 18 months so you do try to cast people who can be there for the long haul and have the right spirit, and we had a fantastic cast.' The most expensive item in the collection is Frodo's sword 'Sting', an Elven blade which glows blue when danger is close, which is tipped to fetch $164,000. The sword is given to Frodo by his uncle Bilbo Baggins in the first Lord Of The Rings installment The Fellowship Of The Ring and used throughout all three films. Made from lightweight aluminium, it is engraved with Elvish insciptions and boasts dents from on-scene sword fights. Familiar faces: A leather headpiece, left, as worn by extras can be bought alongside the mask of Sauron, right . An 18-carat gold prototype of 'the one ring', the centrepiece of the story, is expected to sell for around $82,000. It was the last of nine prototypes of the ring, which is famously called 'my precious' by deformed hobbit Gollum. The other eight rings are also up for sale for $20,000 each. The prosthetic ears and feet worn by Sir Ian Holm as Bilbo and Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee are on offer for just under $4,000 and $33,000 respectively. A white wooden staff belonging to Gandalf costs $69,000 while Gimli's helmet costs $57,000. Lord Of The Rings memoribilia is so sought after that even a roll of sticky tape used on the set of the films is tipped to fetch $130. Weapons of choice: Among the props are familiar axes and staves the likes of which were wielded by wizards . The collection is being sold off in 92 lots and is expected to fetch 2.4 million pounds when it goes under the hammer. Darren Julien, of Julien's Auctions, said: 'This collection is unique - there is nothing else like it in the world. 'They belong to one Lord Of The Rings enthusiast who began collecting items after the Fellowship Of The Ring in 2001. 'Since then he has scoured the world for original props and costumes from all three films and has ended up with this incredible collection. Legend: Screen icon Sir Ian McKellen famously played the role of Gandalf the wizard. A staff handled by the actor could fetch $69,000 at auction . 'Some of the items have come straight from the production company and others were giveaways from the early days before anyone realised how huge the films would become. 'The collector thought of the items as an investment but he had no idea just how much they would be worth ten years later. 'Lord Of The Rings has an enormous worldwide fanbase, many of whom would give anything to own something authentic from one of the movies. 'These artefacts are incredibly important and send a chill down the backs of many people who see them. The Lord Of The Rings story was split into three three-hour-long installments - The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers and The Return Of The King. The three films were released between 2001 and 2003 and are the highest grossing film trilogy of all time. Between them they won 17 Oscars.

Chancellor George Osborne is also preparing to offer more than 20million basic-rate taxpayers a further tax break, despite calls from the Tory Right for him to do more for middle class families who have been dragged into the 40p rate. The Chancellor is expected to lift the starting rate threshold to £10,500 by the time of the next election, a move which he may signal tomorrow or in next spring’s Budget. A dramatic and expensive hike in personal allowance thresholds from £6,475 to £10,000 means 2.7million people have been lifted out of paying any income tax since 2010. For the average taxpayer, it will amount to paying £705 less income tax compared to when the Coalition took power. But at the other end, the numbers dragged into paying the higher 40p income tax is expected to rise from 4.1million today to 4.9million by 2015. Mr Cameron, speaking on a visit to China, insisted the Government’s focus on the starting rate was right. Aides pointed it offered some benefit right up to incomes of £120,000. ‘Lifting the income tax threshold benefits all but the richest because it does benefit people on middle and even higher levels of pay,’ the Prime Minister said. Married couples: The Prime Minister suggested his focus was instead on further increases to the starting threshold for tax and to 'extend further' tax breaks for marriage . ‘By next April it will be worth around . £705 to the typical taxpayer so I think it’s been a very good way of . trying to help families with their finances at a difficult time but . recognising that there should be a benefit as we keep the costs of . Government down and pay down the deficit. ‘At the same time, I’m a low-tax Tory, I believe in allowing people to keep more of their own money to spend as they choose. Offer: Chancellor George Osborne is also preparing to offer more than 20million basic-rate taxpayers a further tax break . ‘But I’m also a fiscal conservative, I believe the first duty of government is to safeguard our economy and the economy isn’t safeguarded properly until you deal with your deficit and make sure that you’re in a position where future problems that could come down the road, you’re able to absorb them.’ On the proposed marriage tax relief, he added: ‘We will be making this change to back marriage in the tax system. It’s a change I strongly support. It’s very similar to what we set out in our manifesto. ‘I believe in marriage, I believe marriage should be recognised in the tax system. I see this as yes, a start of something I would like to extend further.’ Despite rumours that he and the Chancellor disagree on the marriage tax break, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘I have a very, very strong relationship with the Chancellor. We work together hand-in-glove.’ Changes announced in the last Budget mean that for most people the point at which they start to pay higher-rate tax will be £41,865. It means one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn to the Treasury. Normally, the 40 per cent higher-tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living. But from April 2014, the point at which higher-rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead. This lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in the 40 per cent net. Official figures, from HM Revenue and Customs, show there were just three million higher-rate taxpayers when the coalition came to power in May 2010.","David Cameron has brushed off calls from Tory Right to ease 40p tax burden .

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 10:37 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:42 EST, 3 December 2013 . Jailed: Derek Gates has been sentenced to prison for heroin possession . A heroin addict has been condemned by a judge for abusing  and dealing in drugs after his life was saved by an NHS heart transplant operation. Derek Gates, 38, was cleared for surgery by doctors even though his heart problems were caused by drug addiction. But instead of mending his ways, he responded by stepping up his criminal behaviour. Gates went back on heroin, became a dealer and committed 23 drugs offences in a seven-year period after his transplant. Yesterday the case provoked outrage as transplant survivors questioned whether the drug addict should have been given his new heart  above others on the waiting list. Gates was jailed for 18 months at Hull Crown Court on Monday. The recorder, Rachim Singh, passed sentence after hearing police found £430 worth of heroin as well as cannabis and valium tablets in his flat in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, last month. Mr Singh told Gates: ‘Quite what an individual who has had a heart transplant is doing with these type of drugs defies explanation.’ Gates will be allowed to visit his hospital cardiologist from prison. He has refused to co-operate with probation workers who want him to quit drugs. The court heard details of his criminal history, mostly dating from after his transplant 12 years ago. Gates has 32 previous convictions, which include 23 drugs offences committed from 2006 onwards. He is no stranger to prison, having been jailed for two-and-a-half years in 2009 for supplying Class A drugs. His medical history means he cannot be sentenced to do community work since the authorities are unable to get insurance for him. In 2001, aged just 26 and already an addict, he had the heart transplant. It is understood that he needed the operation because his body had been severely damaged by drug use. His failure to seriously attempt to give up drugs meant the judge was left with little alternative to a prison sentence. As someone with a history of drug abuse he would have had to adhere to ‘strict conditions’ before being cleared by medical experts for a transplant. He would have had to convince doctors of his ability to kick the habit, an NHS spokesman said. However, there was anger yesterday about a £40,000 operation being given to a drug addict. Ashleigh Leybourne, 28, whose daughter Scarlett underwent a heart transplant as a baby, said: ‘I don’t think he should have been given the heart in the first place. ‘That organ could have gone to someone . else who couldn’t help the fact they were ill and could have used the . heart so much better. Scarlett didn’t choose to be in need of a new . heart, neither do millions of people. 'I think it’s disrespectful to the . donor, the donor’s friends and family and to all of the medical staff . who performed the operation and helped him recover.’ Ruth . Skinner, 67, of Sudbury, Suffolk, suffered from a condition that caused . her heart to swell and received the heart of a 17-year-old boy in 2000. Ill health: Gates, 38, was previously given a heart transplant paid for by the NHS . Commenting on the case, she said: ‘I think what this guy has done is absolutely awful. ‘He . has been given this wonderful chance and he has abused it. There  are . so many people who really need a heart transplant and will die if they . do not get one. 'For him to take a heart transplant when there are so . many other people waiting is just so selfish. How will the families feel . of the person whose heart he inherited?’ Gates . also appeared in court in February after being caught with £340 worth . of heroin. Police arrested him as he attempted to swallow evidence. The . court heard he was dealing to pay for his daily fix and the recorder, . Mark McKone, let him off with a suspended sentence and a warning. He . told Gates: ‘If you continue to use heroin, not only will you spend . time in prison, it will kill you. Your body cannot take it much longer.’ Sentencing: Gates was jailed for 18 months at Hull Crown Court, pictured, on Monday . But Gates was back in . court on Monday for sentence after pleading guilty to three charges of . drug possession and possession of a knife in a public place. His . barrister Richard Thompson told the court that his transplant was a . result of the drug abuse and referred to his medical condition in an . attempt to avoid a jail term. ‘He . is a man of poor health,’ he said. ‘You will see from his medical . records that Mr Gates is a heart transplant patient who requires . medication and regular contact with medical services. All these matters . are making him anxious about going into custody.’ Mr Thompson said his client was also worried about how his girlfriend, who is pregnant, would cope without him. He said Gates had used ‘seven bags of heroin a day’  at one time and was dealing to pay for his habit.","Derek Gates, 38, has continued to take heroin as well as dealing drugs .

"By . Luke Salkeld . PUBLISHED: . 10:33 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:14 EST, 3 December 2013 . A woman whose family was wiped out in a car crash said 'I lost my everybody' in the collision. Elber Twomey was the only survivor after the crash which took the lives of her husband, their son and their unborn child. The suicidal driver of the other vehicle was also killed. 'I lost my everbody': Elber Twomey criticises the police who she blames for causing the crash which killed her husband, her son and her unborn child in Torquay, Devon . Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was 24 weeks pregnant at the time, said her family would still be alive if police hadn’t pursued the car of 26-year-old Marek Wojiechowski. Emergency services were contacted after he left his wife a suicide note, and when his car was spotted, an officer gave chase, switching on his flashing lights and siren. Wojiechowski then ‘deliberately’ drove straight into the Twomeys family’s VW Golf during their holiday in Torquay, Devon. Oisin Twomey, who was 16 months old, died at the scene. Crash scene: A father, a son and his wife's unborn child all died following this crash in Torquay, Devon, in July last year. Marek Wojiechowski deliberately crashed his vehicle into the Twomey family's VW Golf . Grief: Elber Twomey with her husband Con on their wedding day. He died 10 months after a crash which killed their toddler son . His father Con, 39, died later ten months later in hospital after suffering serious brain injuries. Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was hospitalised for months and lost her unborn daughter, spoke after the inquest of her son and the Polish taxi-driver. She believes that police driver’s approach was ‘completely wrong’ and caused Wojiechowski to panic. Speaking on the last day of the inquest in Torquay, she said of the day of the crash in July 2012: ‘I lost my everybody. ‘Up to 2.46pm on July 6th I had not a care in the world. ‘I was on holiday with my darling husband and best friend Con, our beautiful little man, baba Oisin and our beautiful unborn daughter. At 2.47pm our wonderful life ended.’ She continued:’I will always be of the opinion that the manner in which the police dealt with Marek that horrific day was completely wrong. ‘I believe that a more cautious and considered response by the police is necessary to protect lives. The lack of this caution has cost me my entire family.’ She continued: ‘I believe it was a misjudgement by the police officer involved to request Marek to stop. ‘He was not driving erratically, he did not have his wife and children with him and he had not indicated that he would end his life by using his car. ‘While I don’t blame the police officer involved personally for my tragic story, I do blame the police service.’ The inquest heard that Wojiechowski had agreed to split with his wife Agnieszka and left a four-page suicide note. Accident victim: Oisin Twomey, aged 16 months, who died at the scene following the crash in Torquay, Devon, last year . She raised the alarm when she found the letter and CCTV cameras recorded him circling a roundabout and driving in a continuous two-mile loop. Police response driver PC Ben Bickford spotted a black car driving in the opposite carriageway and followed to see if it was Wojiechowski. Suicidal: Marek Wojciechowski who caused the crash which wiped out a young family . He drove between 70 and 80 mph to catch up and flashed his lights to signal the driver to pull over. PC Bickford told a previous hearing of the inquest: ‘When I saw that he wasn’t going to stop I pulled back. I am not a trained pursuit driver. The driver was aware of my presence. ‘As we approached the single carriageway he made a deliberate act of accelerating and driving straight into the other carriageway.’ Wojiechowski, a former chef, was arrested at the scene but died from his injuries later that day in hospital. Mr Twomey was transported back to a hospital near his native Cork in Ireland but died in May this year. In a narrative verdict, a . jury of 10 said that both Oisin and Wojiechowski died because the . Pole had ‘suddenly steered his car across the road into the opposite . carriageway and accelerated into oncoming traffic in an attempt to . commit suicide.’ Coroner . for Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon, Ian Arrow said the police officer . involved did all he could but he planned to write to the Association of . Chief Police Officers to ask for a review. He . said: ‘Particular review should be given to how police officers should . approach and deal with distressed or vulnerable individuals. It may . require further with health care professionals.’ Chief Superintendent and head of operations for Devon and Cornwall Police, Jim Nye, said after the inquest that the police officer acted appropriately and in line with national guidelines. Mrs Twomey said she rejected the findings of an IPCC report that said ‘no learning outcomes or organisational learning was identified’ from the tragedy.","Elber Twomey was 24 weeks pregnant when the crash wiped out her family .
