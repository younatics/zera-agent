"(CNN) -- A hacker scandal involving a video is sending shockwaves through Colombia's presidential campaign just days before Sunday's election, making the already volatile electoral process even more contentious as parties accuse each other of dirty tricks and schemes. The video published by the weekly news magazine ""Semana"" in Bogotá allegedly shows Óscar Iván Zuluaga, the leading presidential candidate, getting secret military information from a man who was arrested earlier this month and accused of illegal hacking activities. Andrés Sepúlveda, 29, was arrested on May 5 and accused of ""managing an illegal office dedicated to intercepting emails from between those close to the peace dialogues in Havana (Cuba),"" according to a news release published by the Colombian attorney general's office. The government of President Juan Manuel Santos, who is running for re-election, has held peace talks with the Marxist FARC guerrillas since late 2012. Authorities confiscated 69 pieces of evidence, including computers and USB drives belonging to the suspect, according to the attorney general's office. Zuluaga told reporters the five-minute video is ""a vulgar montage"" put together to smear his campaign. ""This video montage is a trap. It's no coincidence that it's been published when I'm on top in the polls and the president is going down,"" Zuluaga said. Santos has not commented directly on the video. A poll published by Ipsos Napoleon Franco on Friday, before the scandal broke, said Zuluaga would receive 29.5% of the vote versus 28.5% for Santos. Colombian law forbids the publication of polls seven days before a presidential election, so there's no way of knowing whether the scandal has changed last week's percentages. Former President Alvaro Uribe, a Zuluaga supporter, called the video ""a montage"" and suggested the scandal is the creation of the Santos campaign. ""(Andrés Sepúlveda) is an alleged 'hacker' who has worked with (Venezuelan political strategist) J.J. Rendón, who's close to President Santos. In the video, they show Óscar Iván Zuluaga getting information that has already been in the rumor mill and has no relevance,"" Uribe said. Rendón had been working for the Santos campaign but resigned earlier this month after accusations surfaced that he had received $12 million from drug traffickers in exchange for political favors in the Santos government. In the past, Rendón worked for Uribe. Enrique Peñalosa, the Alianza Verde (Green Alliance) presidential candidate, told CNN affiliate Caracol TV he believes Zuluaga has committed a serious crime. ""We're talking about the crime of illegal wiretapping, conspiracy to commit a crime, and the crime of using military information and intelligence. We Colombians cannot resign ourselves to this. These are not the leaders we want,"" Peñalosa said. Javier Restrepo, a pollster with Ipsos Napoleon Franco, says Colombian voters essentially face one choice: Do they vote for the candidate who wants peace talks with the FARC or the one who wants the guerrillas to surrender? ""The difference regarding the candidates' position in the economy and other issues is minimal, but when it comes to how to handle the guerrilla, it's abysmal,"" Restrepo said. ""Santos is advocating for a continuation of the peace talks he started in 2012, while Zuluaga's position is that there should not be a dialogue with an illegal guerrilla until its fighters surrender to government forces and lay down their weapons,"" Restrepo said. There are five presidential candidates, but the only two with a real possibility of winning are Zuluaga and Santos, according to Restrepo. Colombian electoral law says to win a presidential election, a candidate must obtain 50% of the vote plus one vote, which means a second round on June 15 is very likely.","A video purports to show Colombian presidential challenger with accused hacker .

"(CNN) -- There are few rivalries in sport that capture the imagination like the coming together of Real Madrid and Barcelona -- a soccer match of such enormity that it has its own nickname: ""El Clasico."" On the field, it is a billion-dollar grudge match between the two best teams in the football-mad country of Spain. Off the field, it is a tale of two cities -- a clash of Castilian nationalism and Catalan pride; and a rivalry of cultures forged in the Spanish civil war and the reign of General Franco. The two will clash Wednesday at Real Madrid's Estadio Santiago Bernabéu before traveling to Barcelona for the second leg of the Champions League semifinal next week. In a freak of fixture commitments, the superpowers of Spain will have met four times in the space of 18 days by May 4, giving the historic rivalry an epic new chapter. Is Real Madrid's Jose Mourinho the master of mind games? Billion-dollar ball game . The modern-day El Clasico brings together the world's two highest-earning sports clubs -- boasting combined revenues of over $1 billion, according to international consulting firm Deloitte.   The great rivals also lead the sports world in wages. According to Sporting Intelligence, Barca paid an average salary of $7.9 million to players last season, with Madrid dishing out $7.4 million. The New York Yankees baseball team are third on the list, paying an average $6.8 million. ""Both teams (Madrid and Barca) have steadily grown their revenue streams in recent years, contributing to their on-pitch performance through investment in better facilities, players and the development of youth team players,"" said Dan Jones, sports business partner at Deloitte. But while the two teams clearly share a license to print money, they have contrasting approaches to the business of spending it. Madrid are famed for their extravagance -- with the $130 million paid to Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 typical of their cavalier policy in the transfer market. They profess the '""Galacticos"" mentality -- a team of superstars -- demonstrated by a 2010-11 squad that cost an eye-watering $689 million to assemble. Barca are not without their big-name signings, but rely far more heavily on homegrown talent -- with the likes of Lionel Messi and Spanish World Cup winners Xavi and Andres Iniesta being products of the club's youth academy. Barca's current squad cost just $254 million to assemble. History of rivalry . Barcelona and Real Madrid played for the first time in 1902, but the rivalry soon transcended the confines of a soccer match. Barca came to represent the fight for Catalan independence from Spain, and a rejection of the nationalist regime that ruled the country from Madrid -- especially under the rule of Franco, who came to power at the culmination of the bloody Spanish Civil War in 1939. ""In Spain, the population of Catalonia don't consider themselves Spanish,"" said Adi-Oula Sebastian, editor of Barca fan site barcablaugranes.com. ""When the General Franco dictatorship forbade the use of regional dialects, the Camp Nou (Barcelona's home stadium) became one of the few places Catalans were allowed to speak their language, without having to fear repercussions."" Madrid were the all-powerful institution. They had political and royal backing -- the ""Real"" in their name, meaning ""Royal,"" was a gift from King Alfonso XIII in 1920 -- and from the 1950s, boasted a collection of the world's best and most glamorous players. ""For Madrid fans, the game isn't just about getting one over on our eternal rivals, it's about winning a small argument about the country itself,"" said Gabe Lezra, editor of fan site, managingmadrid.com . ""In many ways, Madrid fans view these games as a playful argument about the way to see and understand the country as a whole."" The relationship was exacerbated by the transfer of Alfredo Di Stefano to Madrid in 1953. The Argentine was wanted by both clubs, and both thought they'd signed him. But it was Madrid who got the legendary striker, and Di Stefano duly inspired a decade of dominance at the Bernabeu. Barca have always suspected foul play. Their official website claims a ""royal decree"" persuaded Di Stefano to join Madrid, and there has long been the suggestion that the establishment pushed the deal through. ""To this day supporters of Barcelona feel robbed, while Madrid fans argue the legitimacy of the deal,"" said Sebastian. ""Imagine if Michael Jordan gave his word to sign for the Chicago Bulls, then joined the New York Knicks instead!"" El Clasico personalities . The El Clasico as we find it today is defined by two world-class players, and two world-beating coaches. It is Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo against Barca's Messi on the field, and Jose Mourinho against Pep Guardiola on the sidelines. Is Jose Mourinho the master of mind games? Ronaldo is the powerfully-built Portuguese winger, with speed to burn and an armory of tricks at his disposal. Messi is the pint-size Argentine genius, who took Ronaldo's crown as World Player of the Year in 2009 -- and retained the award in 2010. ""There's no-one to touch Messi at the moment. People compare him to the great Diego Maradona, and it's a fair comparison,"" said Tim Hanlan, author of ""A Catalan Dream."" ""Ronaldo is not quite on the same level, but his strength and pace can make him just as effective as Messi on his day."" Both players are having prolific seasons in front of goal, with each vying to be Europe's top scorer. Their coaches have equally impressive resumes. Guardiola took over at Barcelona in 2008, and led his team to Champions League glory in his first season in charge. Mourinho oversaw Porto's shock European triumph in 2004, and repeated the feat with Inter Milan in 2010. ""I've always loved Mourinho. Since his time at Porto I wanted him to join Madrid,"" said Lezra. ""He's a brilliant tactician, an incredible motivator and a born winner. And his personality fits Real Madrid perfectly."" Footballing duopoly  Until relatively recently the Real-Barca rivalry was a one-sided affair. Madrid built dynasties in the 1950s and 1960s, and continued to dominate domestically and in Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Barca enjoyed sporadic success, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that they finally launched a dynasty of their own -- winning four titles in a row under Dutch coach Johan Cruyff before lifting their first European Cup in 1992. The balance of power shifted back and forth over the next 15 years, but Barca are now in the ascendancy. Guardiola's team have won the last two Spanish titles, and claimed a third Champions League crown in 2009. Meanwhile, Madrid are without a European success since 2002. ""Barcelona are definitely on top right now. They've put together a great team, and have been playing the same style, with more or less the same players, for the last four years or so,"" said Lezra. ""Madrid, on the other hand, have fired managers, brought in new players and made various tactical adjustments -- not a good strategy if you're looking for long-term success."" Whether Barca can stay on stop will undoubtedly be influenced by the outcome of this year's Champions League semifinal -- the latest chapter in a rivalry as fierce and colorful as any in sport. Who are you rooting for? ""The rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid is special because both teams are made up of superstars,"" said Sebastian. ""You'll be hard-pressed to find as many world-class players sharing the pitch at the same time. In football, the El Clasico rivalry is as good as it gets.""","Real Madrid and Barcelona are Spain's richest and most successful football teams .
Their rivalry began in 1902, when Barcelona won a Spanish Cup semifinal 3-1 .
The teams have since shared 51 Spanish La Liga titles, Madrid winning 31 to Barca's 20 .
In 2011 Barcelona and Real Madrid were drawn to play four times in 18 days ."
"(CNN) -- Steven Van Zandt did not mince words. Steven Van Zandt (right) wants musicians to have a sense of history and care for their craft. ""I want to spend just a minute on a topic that never ever gets discussed in the music business -- the music,"" the Bruce Springsteen guitarist and ""Sopranos"" star said in a speech to the SXSW music and arts festival in March. ""The reason nobody wants to talk about it is because it mostly sucks! ""Who are we kidding here?"" he said. ""Nobody's buying records? Because they suck!"" He called the speech ""A Crisis of Craft,"" and implored listeners to get back to rock 'n' roll's roots. Learn how to play cover songs, he said. Get people to dance. Harness your working-class energy. Take pride in craft. It's been two months since that speech, and Van Zandt is still passionate about the subject. ""[Rock 'n' roll] is a craft that has to be learned,"" he tells CNN. ""There are things you learn by listening to great records, copying heroes."" He believes that he said some things that people were thinking, but haven't said out loud. But the rumbles are out there. The music business is in a state of flux, with the sales of more profitable CDs continuing to fall even as single downloads climb. ""American Idol's"" season is coming to an end, with rock purists once again assailing the show's slick pop sensibility. Commercial radio, country, rap and hip-hop -- they all have their critics, many of them wishing a return to the way things used to be. Blog: What do you think of the state of rock 'n' roll? Van Zandt has sympathy for all sides, coming at the issue from what he calls ""a unique perspective"" -- he's a musician, a DJ (with his radio show and Sirius XM channel, ""Little Steven's Underground Garage"") and record label honcho (Wicked Cool Records). He's quick to observe that he's not slamming all pop music. There's vibrancy in some hip-hop, he says, and he admires ""Idol,"" particularly when it promotes music history. ""But it's quite an alien world to my traditional rock 'n' roll world,"" he adds. ""It has nothing to do with it."" Within that rock 'n' roll world, he worries. Today's bands, he says, look down on performing covers, and as a result many have gotten lost in a musical wilderness. ""The result is an extraordinary amount of mediocrity,"" he says. ""There are no standards to live up to."" Which is part of the problem with rejuvenating rock 'n' roll, says Steve Greenberg, founder of S-Curve Records, which includes alt-rockers Tinted Windows and We The Kings among its acts. Technology is one problem, he observes. ""I think in the old days, in order to even be decent, it took a lot of work,"" he says. ""And today, relatively untalented and uncreative people can actually make rock 'n' roll music that sounds kind of decent. And I think that kind of fools people and causes people to be lazy."" But for Greenberg there's also a sense that the ""square pegs"" -- the naturally rebellious types -- are getting shoved in round holes. ""A lot of opportunities inevitably these days go to people who fit the format, whether the format is Top 40 radio or 'American Idol' or [Radio] Disney or whatever it is,"" he says. ""There's so much pressure to fit those slots. And it's the square pegs ultimately who are going to change the world."" The spirited Greenberg wants to channel that rebellious energy. He's high on a band he signed named Care Bears on Fire, a trio of 13-year-old Brooklyn girls who sound like the Ramones with a touch of Shonen Knife. ""Their attitude is maybe one size doesn't fit all,"" he says. ""I feel like the spirit of rock 'n' roll lives in those guys. ... They're having fun playing rock 'n' roll."" Scott Booker, the manager of the avant-pop band the Flaming Lips (""She Don't Use Jelly,"" ""Do You Realize??""), is also hoping to foster creativity. He's serving as the CEO of the Academy of Contemporary Music, a music school based at Central Oklahoma University. Drawing from a British concept, the school plans to offer courses in music, music production and the music business, many starting this fall. Booker observes record labels aren't spending as much money on developing talent. He hopes the ACM not only makes bands more signable, but also teaches them business strategies, such as setting up their own label and distribution apparatus. ""This could become a think tank for how the industry could go,"" he says, musing aloud. ""People think of music as a throwaway cultural item [nowadays]. I want to change that. ... Make things more exciting."" Technology, adds BMI executive Phil Graham, can also be rock 'n' roll's friend. ""The opportunities the digital world give the population as a whole to throw their talents to a very wide audience is a very good thing,"" he says. More people have gotten the chance to put their music out there and connect with fellow music lovers, he says. Of course, there are also old-fashioned connections. BMI sponsors dozens of showcases for new acts; young bands play clubs and hawk their CDs (or Web page). Van Zandt welcomes the efforts, but hopes there's also a connection to rock 'n' roll history. He's founded a Rock and Roll Forever Foundation to foster music education in schools. (To its credit, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum has similar programs.) ""The spark comes from whatever people are into these days -- and that very well may be 'American Idol,' "" he says. ""You start with whatever singer you're rooting for, and you start to trace back where they come from. It's up to the artists themselves to make sure that their fans know where they're coming from, to make it clear that music doesn't fall off trees.""","Steven Van Zandt: Bands aren't woodshedding, aren't learning rock 'n' roll history .

"(CNN) -- A Mississippi high school faces a lawsuit over its decision to cancel its prom rather than allow a lesbian high school student to attend with her girlfriend. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, alleges that officials at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Mississippi, are violating the student's First Amendment right to freedom of expression. The ACLU asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi to reinstate the prom. ""All I wanted was the same chance to enjoy my prom night like any other student. But my school would rather hurt all the students than treat everyone fairly,"" said the student, 18-year-old Constance McMillen, in an ACLU news release. ""This isn't just about me and my rights anymore -- now I'm fighting for the right of all the students at my school to have our prom."" At the center of the lawsuit is a memorandum from the school to students, dated February 5, which states that prom dates must be of the opposite sex. Also, when McMillen expressed a desire to wear a tuxedo to the prom, the superintendent told her only male students were allowed to wear tuxes, according to court documents. Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if any of the other students complained about their presence there, according to the documents. The prom was canceled after McMillen and the ACLU tried informally to get the school to change its stance. Officials at the Itawamba County School District were not immediately available for comment Thursday. In a statement released Wednesday, the county's board of education said that, ""Due to the distractions to the educational process caused by recent events, the Itawamba County School District has decided to not host a prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School this year."" The school hoped that private citizens in the community would organize an event to replace the prom, the statement said. The decision was made, the board of education said, ""taking into consideration the education, safety and well-being of our students."" ""Itawamba school officials are trying to turn [McMillen] into the villain who called the whole thing off, and that just isn't what happened,"" said Kristy Bennett, Legal Director of the ACLU of Mississippi. She's fighting for everyone to be able to enjoy the prom. ""The government, and that includes public schools, can't censor someone's free expression just because some other person might not like it.""","Lawsuit alleges officials are violating student's right to freedom of expression .

"(CNN) -- In the violent bedlam that has engulfed Gaza, not even the hospitals are immune from attack. Such an attack happened Monday afternoon to the Shuhada al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza, where several artillery shells slammed into buildings there. Video from the scene shows doctors frantically bringing hospital workers and patients to the relative safety of the ground floor. One patient and four people visiting the hospital, three of them children, were killed in the strike, according to health workers. At least 30 were injured, they said. Despite the risks, Eloise Bollack, a freelance French journalist, made her way to the hospital. The latest reports from Gaza and Israel . ""The road to Deir Al-Balah [the neighborhood where the Shuhada al-Aqsa hospital is located] was really dangerous and exposed,"" she said. ""At one point, when we arrived near the hospital ... a bomb fell 50 meters away from us."" Bollack said that she decided to leave because ""it was too dangerous to stick around."" But on the way back to Gaza City, her team saw a convoy of the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society making its way to Deir al-Balah. She did a U-turn and followed the vehicles. ""All the hospital staff were on the ground floor when we arrived. They were waiting for the ICRC convoy so they can evacuate the patients"" to other hospitals. ""We started walking around to the other floors to see the damage. One side of the third floor was bombed several times; we saw a lot of impact hits from tank shells on the walls,"" she said. Operating theaters and the maternity ward were among the rooms damaged. ""Some walls and rooms were totally destroyed, covered with dust and debris. Everything was upside down. The shock was so strong that a pillow in one of the rooms was hanging on the fan on the ceiling. ""The tank shells fired not only penetrated through the exterior wall but managed to go through several walls inside the hospital, shows the power of the impact these shells did on the hospital."" The hospital is one of three in Gaza to have been damaged during nearly two weeks of conflict. Last week, the al-Wafa hospital in northern Gaza was hit by an airstrike. Israel: Hamas was storing weapons there . Israeli officials say that Hamas has deliberately used hospitals and buildings around them to store weapons or build launching sites for their rockets. In the case of the Shuhada al-Aqsa, the Israeli Defense Forces said that their ""initial investigation suggests that a cache of anti-tank missiles was stored in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. This cache was successfully targeted by IDF forces."" In a statement, the IDF added: ""Civilian casualties are a tragic inevitability of the brutal and systematic exploitation of homes, hospitals and mosques in Gaza. While the IDF takes every possible measure to minimize civilian casualties, Hamas and its deliberate tactic of embedding terrorist activities within the urban environment is ultimately responsible."" For the patients and the medical staff trying to save their lives, the consequence is the same. Hospitals are running out of rooms to cope with admissions and running short of medicine and other essential supplies. Patients lie in corridors. The United Nations has arranged for truckloads of medical supplies to cross into Gaza from Israel, but some are delayed because of the conflict. Paramedics pay the ultimate price . Paramedics have been among the casualties as they have raced through Gaza's crowded streets to collect the injured. On Sunday, one paramedic died and four injured yesterday when their ambulance was hit during Israeli shelling of the Shujaiya neighborhood. The Gaza Health Ministry says 24 ambulances have been destroyed or disabled since the conflict began. Bollack is based in Ramallah in the West Bank and has long been sympathetic to the Palestinian people. But she says she is committed to nonviolence and is committed to documenting the suffering of civilians. She says Gaza's hospitals are gradually being reduced to ruins. ""You can see around the [Shuhada al-Aqsa] hospital that there is water running in the street because the water tanks were bombed and the water system that feeds the hospital was destroyed by the shells."" But even if the hospitals themselves are unsafe, they continue working, she says. ""They are planning to evacuate the entire hospital because it's too dangerous, but for now, they want to keep the hospital running because it's the only hospital around.""

"(CNN) -- A standoff between Boeing and thousands of unionized workers based in Washington state came to an unexpected end Friday after workers voted in favor of a contract to build the company's new commercial jet. The deal keeps economic activity worth billions inside the state, and means hundreds of thousands of jobs will be retained. The vote Friday, from the International Association of Machinists District 751, came in at 51% to 49%. It was a dramatic reversal in the machinists' stance, after they had overwhelmingly rejected a similar contract less than two months ago. The new contract, which will run from 2016 to 2024, means an end to the traditional pension plan for more than 33,000 machinists at Boeing, replacing it with a 401(k) type of plan. The plan had been a sticking point, but fear of losing jobs and work connected to the jet prompted members to change their minds. Union representatives told media they didn't like the position, but were forced to accept it. Local union officials had pointed to the loss of the pension as the prime reason to reject the deal, also arguing that approving the contract would encourage the company to make continued threats to move work elsewhere in the future in order to win other concessions. However, IAM International leadership had argued the new offer was better than one that was rejected last year, adding about $1 billion in value to members. The improvements include an additional $5,000 bonus in 2020 and the continuation of the current formula for how new hires move up the pay scale. Jim Bearden, speaking on behalf of the local union president,Tom Wroblewski, said, ""Our members have spoken, and having said that, this is the course we'll take. No member liked this or the position we were put in by the company."" ""We faced tremendous pressure from every source imaginable,"" Bearden said. ""Politicians, the media, and others, who truly had no right to get into our business, who were aligned against us."" Ray Conner, chief executive officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement that the 777X and the composite wings would now be built in the Puget Sound area, where the company's plants are based. ""Thanks to this vote by our employees, the future of Boeing in the Puget Sound region has never looked brighter,"" he said. The 777X is Boeing's answer to the Airbus A350-900/1000, which competes with Boeing's current 777 Classic series of jet airliners. The 777 Classic is assembled at Boeing's production plant in Everett, Washngton, near Seattle. The Classic's metal wings are built in Japan, shipped to Everett and joined to the fuselage at the Boeing plant. Production of the 777X will begin in 2016, with a first flight due in 2018 before it goes into service in 2020. The jet will use carbon-composite wings, which are regarded as the plum of the program. State officials had pulled out all the stops to win the program. Gov. Jay Inslee said losing the 777X to another state would be the beginning of the end of Boeing's production in Washington, where the company employs nearly 90,000 and drives another 270,000 indirect jobs. Elected officials and others believed that losing the 777X and the composite wings would mean future airplanes would follow the 777X to other states.","Machinists' union votes in favor of building Boeing's new jet in Washington state .

"(CNN) -- A group of women in a violence-plagued area of the Philippines came up with their own weapon to end the fighting -- a sex strike. The women withheld sex from their husbands until they promised to quit fighting. Their stand helped end clashes in July between villages in rural Mindanao Island, a recently released U.N. Refugee Agency report says. U.N. Refugee Agency report . A separatist rebellion has been underway on the Filipino island of Mindanao since the 1970s. Families of Dado village had been displaced because of it since 2008 and are working to rebuild their community with the help of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other aid organizations. Women of the village came up with the idea of a sex strike as a way to help rebuild their village and to bring peace during a UNHCR sponsored sewing cooperative. Many of the women were fed up with not being able to deliver their products due to the violence that closed down a main road between two villages. UNHCR Spokesperson for Asia, Kitty McKinsey, said she witnessed the women quietly implement the solution to withhold sex from their husbands until the fighting stopped -- and it worked. ""I told them, if you don't agree with me, you will get no salary from me,"" says Aninon E. Kamanza of the Dado village sewing cooperative in a UNHCR video report. Within weeks of the strike starting, the UNHCR reports that the main village road re-opened and the fighting stopped. The women of the sewing cooperative along with other villagers were able to deliver their goods and start to rebuild the economy. ""Women wanted their husbands to not fight anymore and by using their feminine wiles they were able to enforce their wish,"" said McKinsey. The idea of withholding sex for a cause is not a new one -- the ancient Greek play Lysistrata tells the story of women who organized a sex strike to end a war between Athens and Sparta. More recently, a strike was launched in 2006 in the Colombian city of Pereira, known for its drug trafficking and violent crimes. The strike was implemented by wives and girlfriends of gang members to get them to change their lifestyle and hand over their guns. A similar campaign was carried out by women in Kenya in 2009 to protest the growing divide in Kenya's coalition government. Sporadic fighting is still present in Mindanao near Dado village, but it is very localized, McKinsey said. The sex strike is just one of the ways the people in Mindanao are using to implement change. ""I was really touched by how people didn't want handouts,"" she says, ""They were all really happy and eager to help themselves.""","A separatist rebellion has existed in the Mindanao island since the 1970s .

"(CNN) -- In a city where style is king, a Milanese football giant is in need of an urgent makeover, according to the Indonesian businessman who has taken on the challenge. One of only two overseas owners in Serie A after buying a 70% stake in Internazionale in November 2013, Erick Thohir believes globalization is the key to reviving this grand institution. He remembers Italian football's golden age of the 1990s, but given Serie A's current plight -- corruption scandals, racism, fan violence and dilapidated stadia -- those days seem a distant memory. Even Thohir admits his 15-year-old son is more interested in talking about players from the English Premier League than Italy. His solution is for Italian football to open its arms to the world, arguing there are 260 million potential Inter fans across the globe, with as many as 165 million supporters in Asia just waiting to be reconnected with a league dominated in recent years by Juventus. ""Serie A has be to more aggressive,"" the 44-year-old Thohir told CNN in an exclusive interview, as he laid out his vision to revive his underachieving club. Inter last won the scudetto in 2010 and failed to qualify for this season's UEFA Champions League, though the team is in the second-tier Europa League . If Thohir comes armed with ideas to overhaul Inter, he also issues a blunt warning for Serie A, which in recent years has arguably become European football's ugly duckling. ""I specifically tell people if we do another Calciopoli, Serie A will be dead,"" said Thohir, referring to the 2006 scandal when Juventus was heavily sanctioned. ""Italy won't be number two, not three, or even fourth. We will be ninth and lose ground to countries like Portugal and Holland. ""It's important to look at the world globally and not just Italy. The (other club) presidents are open-minded when we talk. A lot of things have to be done."" Inter earns $95 million from domestic and international television rights deals and expects to earn an extra 10% next year, but those sums are dwarfed by the $9.4 billion that the English Premier League's 20 teams share in their latest three-year contract. The 2014-2015 turnover forecast for Inter is $240 million, but again, that's less than half of Manchester United's current $551 million revenue, according to Forbes. ""The English Premier League has become bigger and bigger, but Serie A can become the second league in the world,"" said Thohir. ""We still have a good foundation and can compete with Germany's Bundesliga and Spain's La Liga."" Comparing Serie A with the English Premier League is like chalk and cheese, admits Inter's chief executive officer Michael Bolingbroke, who previously worked for Manchester United and entertainment company Cirque de Soleil before he was appointed by Thohir in July. One of Bolingbroke's first tasks it to increase Inter's home attendances at the San Siro, a stadium the club shares with AC Milan. Last season Inter had the highest average Serie A crowd -- 46,246 -- but given the San Siro's 80,000 capacity that's still a lot of empty seats. On arriving from England, Bolingbroke was surprised to learn Inter had no football museum of its own at the San Siro, though it does share one with AC Milan. United's Old Trafford museum annually has 400,000 visitors who shell out $29 for a visit which also includes a stadium tour, while the joint San Siro museum has 270,000 visitors who pay $21. Inter now hopes to build its own museum. While Bolingbroke crunches the numbers, Thohir wants more top-flight games kicking off at 3 p.m at the weekend to enable a greater number fans in Asia and the United States to watch Italian football. ""We need to talk to our fans globally,"" added Thohir. ""The beauty of Milan is, as well as football, there's also fashion and culture."" With the NBA now playing games in Asia, the NFL coming to Europe and baseball matches taking place in Australia, Thohir is also open to the idea of Serie A matches being played outside of Italy. ""A lot of fans in different regions want to see the real live game rather than on their television or computer."" Given a similar idea in England has not been openly embraced by a number of Premier League clubs' fans, Thohir might have trouble winning over Italian hardcore supporters, who in the past have proved a stumbling block to reform. However, according to Richard Hall, who writes about Italian fan culture, even the ultras realize things can no longer stay the same. ""They know the stadiums are outdated and attendances are suffering and it's not a family event,"" said Hall, who has written about Inter for the British newspaper The Guardian and U.S. broadcaster ESPN. The ultras see that the English Premier League has ""lost part of its soul,"" according to Hall, who says many Italian fans would prefer Serie A clubs to follow the Bundesliga model, where teams are more closely aligned to their supporters and and represented at boardroom level. ""The fans have to trust us, because what we do is good for the club,"" replies Thohir, when asked if he would consider implementing such a model at Inter. ""Italy has the tradition of the president, but we need to be more professional and corporate and still involve the fans to help us grow."" In Inter's last two games, the patience of even diehard ""Nerazzurri"" might have been tested as coach Walter Mazzarri's team capitulated at home to Cagliari and then at Fiorentina. Those two defeats demonstrated just how much work Thohir and his team have to do in resuscitating this ailing Serie A giant, which languishes in 10th place ahead of Sunday's home clash with Napoli. ""I'm not looking for personal success,"" Thohir says. ""It's more about how can I work hard, supported by my new team, to make Inter one of the top-10 clubs in the world. With a lot of support and the same vision we can do it."" Thohir's decision to acquire a majority stake in Inter with his Indonesian business partner Handy Soetedjo followed investments in the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the MLS team DC United. Conscious of the new constraints imposed by Europe's governing body UEFA with its financial fair play system, Thohir wants Inter to use more data and analytics in following the player-buying strategies pioneered by Billy Beane -- the subject of Michael Lewis' book 'Moneyball' -- at the Oakland Athletics. ""When we decide a player -- we do it collectively,"" said Thohir. ""We sign on the tactical, financial and commercial side. ""This is the model for DC United and it's been pretty sustainable. So far at Inter, we have done OK. We don't want to create bureaucracy and it's important to reduce the risk."" Like fashion, football can be a risky business, but for Thohir, criticism is ""medicine to him."" But will it be the tonic needed to wake Italy's ""sleeping giant""? The football world looks set to find out.","Erick Thohir bought a controlling stake in Inter Milan a year ago .

"(CNN) -- At a time when the trend among state legislatures is to create tough immigration laws, one Ohio city is pinning its ambitions on an opposite track. Dayton, with a population of about 140,000, wants to become the friendliest place for immigrants. Immigrants, officials say, have opened businesses and created jobs in the city's economy, and they hope to reverse the region's economic slowdown by betting on immigrants. The Dayton City Commission this week accepted the so-called ""Welcome Dayton"" plan, a framework for policies that could be implemented to make the city a more welcoming place. The pro-immigrant sentiment in Dayton stands in contrast to a number of high profile laws at the state level targeting illegal immigrants, but it is not a perfect comparison. The state laws are focused on combating illegal immigration. The city plan has nothing to do with illegal immigration, officials say, but rather with welcoming immigrants and treating all residents with respect. ""Critics conveniently connect the word 'immigrant' with the word 'illegal' when talking about the Welcome Dayton plan, but that's not what this initiative is all about,"" City Manager Tim Riordan said in a news release. ""We have many good people from all nationalities coming here to invest in the community and to build a better life."" But at least a couple of the recommendations made in the Welcome Dayton plan appear to take undocumented immigrants into consideration. The plan suggests the creation of a municipal identification card for Dayton residents who don't have any other form of ID. Such a card could presumably help undocumented residents who need identification to open bank accounts or apply for driver's licenses and other services. Another item that could have an impact on those who are in the country illegally is a recommendation that police emphasize immigration status checks only for suspects of serious crimes. Such a policy could protect undocumented immigrants stopped for minor offenses from fearing deportation. It is an opposite approach from those states with laws that seek to have police check the immigration status of everyone they stop. Other Dayton recommendations include improving the interpreter capabilities offered by the city and creating hiring incentives for government employees to learn a foreign language. The Welcome Dayton plan also advocates seeking federal grants for English study for immigrants. It also recommends using city lobbyists to advocate for pro-immigrant laws at the state and federal level. Many of these proposals would be controversial at the federal level, but opposition appeared to be minor in Dayton. At the public hearing where the plan was discussed, 10 members of the public stood up to address the commissioners about it. Nine of the 10 spoke in support of the measure, and the lone dissenter wasn't from Dayton, but from nearby Columbus. The plan was approved unanimously. Dayton Mayor Gary Leitzell declined to speak to CNN Saturday, and referred to a statement posted on his blog, which he read at the commission meeting. ""This plan is designed to enhance the potential of Dayton as a competitor in the global economy by attracting immigrants who bring new ideas, new perspective, and new talent to our work force,"" Leitzell said in the statement. ""In order to reverse the decades-long trend of economic decline in this city, we need to think globally and recruit the very best from around the world."" Welcome Dayton was hatched from a study of housing conditions for Hispanic residents, which ultimately led to a multiagency, communitywide effort to draft the plan. When the city asked its residents about the impact of immigrants, they learned that businesses had been started by immigrants. Houses were rehabilitated and underused buildings were reused and rejuvenated, the report found. According to the city, immigrants are two times more likely than others to become entrepreneurs. ""History proves that closed minds and resistance to change only results in failure,"" Leitzell said. ""To those citizens who are against the Welcome Dayton plan â€” instead of condemning something that you didn't participate in, volunteer to help us make it better.""","Dayton wants to become a nationally recognized immigrant-friendly city .

"(CNN) -- Looking to get to Hawaii without blowing your son's college fund? Want to experience the islands but not sure when to go? Here's how to avoid costly and exhausting mistakes during your Hawaiian vacation. DON'T travel to Hawaii during school holidays.Tourists crowd Hawaii's stunning beaches in summer and winter. During school holidays, flight and hotel rates are off the charts -- between Christmas and New Years, condos and vacation rentals can run three times as much as rates in early December. DO visit Hawaii in the off-season.Hands down the best values on visiting Hawaii can be found in May and October. With prices reasonably low and the weather at its peak -- not too hot, not too rainy -- take advantage of the perks of off-season travel to jet off to the islands. Current spring and fall flight deals from the West Coast are half of July rates. Additionally, hotels and condos generally slash their prices off-season, rewarding visitors with oceanfront accommodations that typically sell out in peak months. Travel Snapshots: Hawaii . DON'T blow your whole budget on a luxury resort.While staying in a luxurious Hawaiian resort where birds flutter through the open-air lobby and fresh papaya is served at the swim-up bar is nice, it is likely to cost between $400-$600 a night in high season. Instead, fork over the cash for a lomilomi massage and gourmet seafood dinner, and make your own poolside Mai Tai at a rental condo. DO consider staying in a condo.Repeat visitors know to rent a condo. Kitchens, ample square footage, washing machines and privacy afford travelers a more authentic (and often less costly) vacation experience. It's common for numerous companies to manage individual units in the same complex, meaning one property may be decked out by a globetrotting interior decorator, while another may be awash in wicker. Be sure to see photos of the particular condo you're interested in and get specifics on the number and configuration of beds. DON'T try to see everything.While each island has its own personality, it is too expensive (and exhausting) to island-hop the entire archipelago on one vacation. Inter-island flights generally run between $70-$140 each way and most travel to Oahu, so if you want to get from Kauai to the Big Island, you might have to stop in Honolulu and basically pay the equivalent of two inter-island flights each way. DO stick to one or two islands.Each region on each island has its own flavor. The north and east sides of the islands are more tropical, while the south and west regions offer sunnier skies and a more arid landscape. Instead of island hopping, break your trip up by staying in a plush hotel within walking distance of a sunny south shore beach and then cozy up in a rental house near the more tropical (read: rainy) north shore. If you want to island-hop on the cheap, Maui offers ferry service to Lanai and Molokai. DON'T fall for the luau.Most luaus are overpriced and far from the real thing (usually family events on a beach for a first birthday). While they seem like an authentic experience, you can actually piece together the highlights of a luau yourself. Grab a picnic of poke, lomi lomi, fresh pineapple, and poi from a local market. In the evenings at most malls on Kauai and Maui, and at sunset at Waikiki Beach, you can watch free hula shows featuring some of Hawaii's best dancers. DO splurge on an adventure.Whether you fancy diving deep into the sea, soaring over waterfalls on a helicopter tour, or a kayak trip along the Na Pali Coast, treat yourself to at least one adventure. Be sure to book early in your trip in case of bad weather. And lastly, DO NOT forget to relax on the beach.No need to be on a boat, or a horse, or a helicopter, or a zip line the whole time. Save time to enjoy Hawaii's world-class beaches. From the shore, you can walk right out into the sea and snorkel with sea turtles, angelfish and monk seals basically for free. As the sun descends over the Pacific, unwind under a coconut palm and watch the sky burst with color as surfers ride the last sunlit waves onto the white sand.

"(CNN) -- His declaration grabbed the ear: I am the son of a mass murderer whose dark deeds and enigmatic identity spawned silver screen thrillers. I am the son of the Zodiac Killer. Gary Stewart of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, may be the latest person to claim lineage with the infamous psycho murderer who inspired the movies ""Zodiac"" and ""Dirty Harry."" But he's not the first to say he is descended from a man who police suspect killed five people in northern California in the late 1960s, then taunted the public with creepy letters to the media. Zodiac has never been caught. And he has, in all, 37 people's lives on his conscience, he has said in his cryptic claims of responsibility. He also may have spawned a child. Others before Stewart have purported to be his offspring. There's the self-proclaimed ""Stepson of the Zodiac Killer,"" Dennis Kaufman, who has appeared on TV news and a crime show touting his deceased stepfather Jack Tarrance as the crazed killer. He said his stepfather's handwriting was similar to the killer's. There's Deborah Perez, who said she wrote some of the claims of responsibility for her father, Guy Ward Hendrickson, when she was 7 years old. Her half-sister called her claims lies. There's Steve Hodel, who says his father was a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle -- the paper to which the Zodiac Killer sent his mocking notes. His claim too was discounted. Whether Stewart's contention will hold true is yet to be seen. Louisiana man claims his biological father was Zodiac Killer . Stewart's biological father . Stewart is accusing his deceased biological father, Earl Van Best Jr. The vice president of a cleaning company has compiled his account into a book published by HarperCollins. ""The Most Dangerous Animal of All"" reveals Zodiac's true identity for the first time, the publisher says -- a claim Perez, Kaufman and others will likely dispute. Stewart sleuthed for a decade through government files and news articles and hunted down relatives to dig up evidence, HarperCollins said. The result is a narrative story about a ""boy with disturbing fixations,"" who can't process being jilted by prospective mates and lets out his rage in a spate of murders. Kaufman has described going to similar lengths with his obsession that his father could be the real killer. He even hired a handwriting analyst to compare his father's handwriting to letters the proclaimed mass murderer mailed to the press. But since Stewart's account is new, investigators may take a gander at it to see if it helps them solve the case that is still open. The author -- who was abandoned as an infant by his biological parents, then later adopted -- promises to answer questions in the case that have been open for nearly 50 years. Police in Northern California have said they weren't aware of the book or its claims. ""It's an open and active case, so we don't comment,"" San Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza told CNN. ""But (it's) certainly something our homicide investigators will take a look at."" Gruesome murders . The Zodiac Killer stalked his victims with knives and guns in 1968 and 1969 and once even dressed as an executioner. He craved publicity, taunting police in letter after letter to newspapers. The letters were often written in a cipher he seemed to have invented himself. ""If you read these letters, he was getting a tremendous thrill out of terrifying the public,"" said Susan Morton, a forensic scientist who has studied the letters. The Zodiac's last known victim, San Francisco cab driver Paul Stine, was shot to death in his cab in 1969. The killer cut out a piece of Stine's blood-stained shirt and mailed it to a newspaper, along with a letter. Police believe the killings stopped, but the letters kept coming until 1974. In the 1970s, a man named Arthur Allen was a prime suspect in the case. He was never charged and denied being the Zodiac Killer until his death in 1992. Stirring the pot . As exciting as Stewart's account sounds, it may be just a new drop in the bucket. More than 2,500 other people have been considered suspects in the case. Investigators said that for decades the phones rang regularly with people wanting to pass on new clues. ""We have talked to many people over the years,"" Steve Blower of the Napa County Sheriff's Office said. Only two people are believed to have survived Zodiac's attacks. One was Bryan Hartnell, who was stabbed eight times in an attack in September 1969. His girlfriend was stabbed between 10 and 20 times. She died, but not before giving a description of her attacker. A sketch of the suspect emerged, and HarperCollins says Stewart's father was a match for it. ""If you look at Gary's photo next to the sketch of the Zodiac (Killer) next to his father's mug shot, you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance,"" HarperCollins publicist Tina Andreadis told the magazine. ""They look alike."" Hartnell told CNN on Wednesday that he took a look at a head shot of Van Best that the publisher is circulating. That portrait is part of the new book. ""The things that I saw that were not inconsistent were the high forehead, the shock of dark hair, and the fact that he wears glasses,"" Hartnell said. Hartnell has his reservations about Stewart's new account, but says he's interested in seeing the book. ""I somewhat follow the news, but there has been no time in the last 40-plus years when someone was not (stirring) the pot,"" Hartnell wrote to CNN in an e-mail. Who is the Zodiac Killer?

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Eight people were killed and 17 were injured Wednesday when an improvised explosive device detonated followed by a suicide bomber's explosion, according to police and medical officials. The attacks targeted people leaving al-Mustafa Shiite mosque after night-time prayers in al-Furat neighborhood in western Baghdad, according to the sources . More than 16 suspects have been arrested by security police, sources told CNN. Al-Furat, a predominantly Shiite neighborhood, is just two miles from Baghdad International Airport. During a televised address earlier Wednesday Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki declared an amnesty for all Sunni tribesmen who fought against the government, with the exception of those involved in the killing of Iraqi forces. Al-Maliki also said he hoped that members of Iraq's parliament would be able to choose a president and prime minister in their next session. After much anticipation over how it would address the country's turmoil, Iraq's new parliament on Tuesday postponed its first session until next week, citing a lack of a quorum. The political uncertainty comes as Iraqi forces battle Sunni extremist militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. ""We are going to postpone because of an urgent matter,"" the speaker of the parliament said Tuesday. He did not say what the urgent matter was, and it was not immediately clear what happened. The newly elected parliament convened with 255 out of 328 elected officials attending, which was enough for a legal quorum, the speaker said. But when 90 failed to return after a morning break, there were not enough members to continue. Many had expected al-Maliki to call for the formation of a new government Tuesday, . Al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government have been under pressure from Western and Arab diplomats to be more inclusive of members of Iraq's Sunni minority, who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process by the government. When ISIS fighters swept into northern Iraq, seizing the city of Mosul, reports emerged of some Sunnis either joining the militants or doing nothing to fight them. Under Iraq's constitution, the parliament has 75 days from when it convenes to pick a prime minister. Lawmakers are under pressure to move faster, but the political body has had trouble moving swiftly in the past. The last time parliament met to pick a prime minister, it took nearly 10 months. Opinion: Will al Qaeda fight ISIS Islamic state? More warplanes arrive . Five more Russian-made Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jets have been delivered to Iraq, the Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Tuesday. The delivery brought to 10 the number of war planes Russia has delivered so far and the ministry said it is expecting a total of 25 under a contract agreed to by Moscow and Baghdad. The announcement follows a comment by al-Maliki that militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. ""I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract"" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in the interview last week, which was released Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. ""God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,"" he said. Kirkuk annexation condemned . In his weekly address, al-Maliki said the priority was to improve the security situation in the country, even as the political process moves forward. ""Security should be the first and foremost on our agendas,"" he said. He thanked Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, for his call for volunteers to pick up arms to defend the country against ISIS and said a new government department would handle their mobilization. Thousands of people, predominantly Shiites, have answered the call, raising concerns among Sunnis about the rise of Shiite militias. Announcing the amnesty for tribesmen who have not killed Iraqi forces, al-Maliki said, ""I welcome them back to the fold and to rejoin their brethren in other Iraqi tribes."" He also strongly rejected the Kurdish regional government's effective annexation of the disputed oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other areas in northern Iraq, saying it was unacceptable. He called on the Kurdish leaders not to take advantage of the state's current weakness to advance their own specific agendas. Any attempt to hold a referendum on the move is invalid because there is no provision in the constitution for self-determination, al-Maliki added. The Prime Minister did not say how he planned to address the move. Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani announced Friday that the disputed areas, including Kirkuk, were henceforth part of the Kurdish autonomous region, after the Iraqi central government failed to hold a long-awaited referendum. Last month, the Iraqi army withdrew from Kirkuk and Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of the city and small villages in the areas as ISIS carried out its lightning offensive. The move by the Kurds will probably complicate efforts to get Iraqi lawmakers to form a new government representing all three major population groups -- Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. U.S.: Iraqi military probably would fight for Baghdad . Emboldened by the weakened Iraqi government's struggle to mount an effective response to their advance, ISIS extremists declared over the weekend that they had set up a caliphate -- or Islamic state -- spanning large areas of Iraq and Syria. Iraqi military units around Baghdad are likely to stand and fight if ISIS militants attack the city, preliminary reports from U.S. military advisers in Iraq and U.S. intelligence personnel concluded, according to a senior U.S. official. The U.S. assessment comes as intelligence also shows that Iranian Quds forces are increasing their efforts to train Shiite militias in and around Baghdad and in southern Iraq. This assessment that Iraqi forces will fight for Baghdad is crucial to the U.S. need to keep Baghdad International Airport secure. The official says 300 American troops there now, along with several Apache helicopters, could not on their own secure the airport, crucial if an evacuation was needed, and it would require the Iraqis to devote a large number of their troops to the effort. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, told a news conference in Baghdad on Wednesday that the current military situation was going in favor of the country's security forces. Atta said Iraqi forces have gained more ground from ISIS militants, many of whom have been killed or arrested. In Salaheddin province, Iraqi forces have secured all the roads leading to the city of Tikrit, Atta said, and have retaken control of a military base formerly known as Camp Speicher on the outskirts the city, the hometown of ex-leader Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, in Anbar province, they have killed 24 militants and arrested 11, among them a known ISIS leader and several of his aides, he said. CNN cannot independently confirm his claims or reports of casualties. Police officials in Samarra, in Salaheddin province, told CNN that the Iraqi air force struck several areas in the town of al-Shirqat, about 280 kilometers (170 miles) north of Baghdad on Wednesday. At least 17 people were killed, including seven members of one family, while nine others were injured, officials said. It was not immediately clear what the Iraqi air force was targeting. Clashes at cleric's office . In unrelated violence, at least three people were killed Tuesday night when Iraqi security forces clashed with supporters of a radical Shiite cleric, police and health officials said. Officials said Iraqi forces raided the offices of cleric Mahmoud al-Hassani al-Sarkhi in Karbala and clashed with his supporters. Nine people were wounded, and one military Humvee was set on fire, police said. The fighting continued Wednesday, an employee at a shrine and a resident of Karbala told CNN. Helicopters fired a number of times on the Saif Saad neighborhood, not far from the city's famed holy shrines, on Tuesday night, they said. The aircraft again hovered over the area Wednesday, as the city was placed on high alert and the streets remained empty of civilians. Iraqi security forces have boosted security around the shrines and at the main entrances to Karbala. Al-Sarkhi last Friday told supporters that Americans are responsible for what is happening in Iraq, according to his official website. He also blamed the bloodshed on the call by al-Sistani for volunteers to join Iraq's forces in the fight against the ISIS militants. In 2006, the cleric's supporters attacked the Iranian Consulate in Basra, about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of Baghdad. Protesters were incensed about insulting remarks made about the cleric on an Iranian TV program. They threw stones and set fire to a building at the consulate. Saving the shrines of Karbala .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- In the early days of the Internet, there was hope that the unprecedented tool for global communication would lead to thoughtful sharing and discussion on its most popular sites. A decade and a half later, the very idea is laughable, says Gawker Media founder Nick Denton. ""It didn't happen,"" said Denton, whose properties include the blogs Gawker, Jezebel, Gizmodo, io9 and Lifehacker. ""It's a promise that has so not happened that people don't even have that ambition anymore. ""The idea of capturing the intelligence of the readership -- that's a joke."" Denton was speaking at South by Southwest Interactive, the annual festival here devoted to Web and digital culture. He said that commenting on his own sites (which he's seen make reporters cry) has gotten so bad that he doesn't engage. ""I don't like going into the comments. ... For every two comments that are interesting -- even if they're critical, you want to engage with them -- there will be eight that are off-topic or just toxic,"" he said. And as sites get more popular, it's harder to control the comments, which inevitably get nastier. ""What you can manage on a small site ... the level of discussion you can have on those is not the level you're able to have on a newspaper site or one of our sites. Our smaller blogs have 2 million unique (visitors per month). ... It's hard to have that intimacy."" So, what's the solution? When it comes to improving open discussion threads, Denton, during an interview-style discussion with blogger and Expert Labs director Anil Dash, seemed quicker to shoot down ideas that others are trying than to provide proposals of his own. Having editors and reporters engage their readers in the comments? ""The writer of the piece has to move on to the next piece. They don't have time to moderate all those comments."" Require readers to post using their real names? ""My own view is that anonymity is at the heart of the Internet."" Give other commenters more power to ""up-vote"" or ""down-vote"" posts? ""We don't really believe in the democratic process of decision-making when it comes to discussion,"" Denton said. For example, he said, Jezebel has made lots of hay off of sexual harassment accusations against American Apparel Chief Executive Officer Dov Charney. Denton said he'd love to see Charney come into the comments section to defend himself. ""If you put it to a vote, 90% would vote to ban him. They hate that guy,"" Denton said. ""If Dov Charney went into the Jezebel comments, he'd be torn limb from limb; his limbs aren't all that would be torn off."" The answer? Denton said his sites are planning to post some stories that allow only a hand-picked, pre-approved group of people to comment on them. That, he said, would make the comment section an extension of the story and allow people, like Charney in the above example, to have their say without fear of being piled onto by others. ""I think it's part of the answer,"" he said. ""What I want is, I want the sources -- I want the experts to be able to comment in these discussions."" When he took questions, Denton had to do a little answering about the responsibility the tone of a site itself has in guiding its comments section. Many of Gawker's sites aren't known for being particularly delicate (One of today's top Gawker headlines: ""Arnold Schwarzenegger's Son Injures Ass Skiing, Tweets Photo""). ""It's certainly true that nice sites run by nice people ... that encourages good behavior,"" Denton said. ""But it's not as if it's entirely the writer setting the tone for the comments. Sometimes, it's the comments setting the tone for the writer.""","Gawker chief: Idea of positive online comments has become a joke .

"Moscow (CNN) -- An Estonian security officer detained by Russia last week has been charged with espionage and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, one of his lawyers said Thursday. Security officer Eston Kohver is currently in a detention center in Moscow, lawyer Mark Feygin told CNN over the phone. Estonia summoned Russia's ambassador on Friday to demand an explanation regarding what it described as the abduction of a security official near the countries' joint border. Russian officials say the Estonian was detained in Russia's northwest Pskov region, where they allege he was carrying out an undercover operation, according to a report from state-run news agency Itar-Tass. The Estonian officer ""had a Taurus handgun, an amount of â‚¬5,000 in cash, equipment for covert audio recording, and materials indicative of an intelligence mission,"" Itar-Tass reported, citing Russia's security service, the FSB. The dueling claims follow mounting tensions between the two nations. Only last week, U.S. President Barack Obama visited Estonia, where he promised that fellow NATO members would protect the Baltic nation against Russian aggression. Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said Wednesday that Estonia considered Kohver's detention to be illegal and demanded his immediate return home. He said two lawyers, one of them Feygin, had been appointed to represent Kohver in what he called an ""extremely complicated situation."" On Thursday, UK Minister for Europe David Lidington raised ""strong concern about the illegal and unacceptable abduction of an Estonian Security Service officer from Estonian territory by Russian Security Services"" in a meeting with the Russian ambassador to London, the UK Foreign Office said. He called for Kohver's immediate release. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter and Joseph Netto also contributed.","Lawyer for detained Estonian security officer Eston Kohver says he's charged with spying .

"(CNN) -- For 50 years the environmental movement has unsuccessfully argued that we should save the planet for moral reasons, that there were more important things than money. Ironically, it now seems it will be money -- through the economic impact of climate change and resource constraint -- that will motivate the sweeping changes necessary to avert catastrophe. The reason is we have now reached a moment where four words -- the earth is full -- will define our times. This is not a philosophical statement; this is just science based in physics, chemistry and biology. There are many science-based analyses of this, but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we're living beyond our means. The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example, calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths to sustain this economy. In other words, to keep operating at our current level, we need 50% more Earth than we've got. Watch Paul Gilding's TED Talk . In financial terms, this would be like always spending 50% more than you earn, going further into debt every year. But of course, you can't borrow natural resources, so we're burning through our capital, or stealing from the future. While they use different words, leaders and experts around the world are acknowledging this. Chinese Environment Minister Zhou Shengxian said last year, ""The depletion, deterioration and exhaustion of resources and the worsening ecological environment have become bottlenecks and grave impediments to (our) economic and social development."" If I had said that in the '90s, when I was the global head of Greenpeace, it would have been dismissed as doom-and-gloom extremism! TED.com: How we wrecked the ocean . Even the previous heresy, that economic growth has limits, is on the table. Belief in infinite growth on a finite planet was always irrational, but it is the nature of denial to ignore hard evidence. Now denial is evaporating, even in the financial markets. As influential fund manager Jeremy Grantham of GMO says: ""The fact is that no compound growth is sustainable. If we maintain our desperate focus on growth, we will run out of everything and crash."" Or as peak oil expert Richard Heinberg argues, we are moving beyond peak oil and into ""peak everything."" Despite this emerging understanding, the growth concept is so deeply ingrained in our thinking that we will keep pushing economic growth as hard as we can, at whatever cost is required. As a result, the crisis will be big, it will be soon, and it will be economic, not environmental. The fact is the planet will take further bludgeoning, further depleting its capital, but the economy cannot -- so we'll respond not because the environment is under great threat, but because the science and economics shows that something far more important to us is jeopardized -- economic growth. TED.com: The biggest health threat facing women . A good indicator is that, despite the recession of the past few years, oil and food prices are approaching record highs again, driven by underlying, long-term trends that even a recession can't slow down. Grantham calls this ""the most important economic event since the Industrial Revolution.""Â . If serious growth returns, the resulting resource price spikes, particularly oil and food, will soon kill it again. As a result, what we are facing is not a few bad years of slow growth like this past recession, but a fundamental shift -- the end of cheap resources and an environment in a state of collapse. Even normally cautious bodies like the International Energy Agency and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are sounding the alarm, with the latter recently releasing a comprehensive report forecasting a world in 2050 that will be defined by resource constraint and its economic impacts. They even dare to ask: ""Will the growth process undermine itself?"" TED.com: Peter Diamandis says abundance is our future . So when this crisis hits, will we respond or will we simply slide into collapse? Crisis elicits a powerful human response, whether it be personal health, natural disaster, corporate crisis or national threat. Previously immovable barriers to change quickly disappear. In this case, the crisis will be global and will manifest as the end of economic growth, thereby striking at the very heart of our model of human progress. While that will make the task of ending denial harder, it also means what's at risk is, quite simply, everything we hold to be important. The last time this happened was World War II, and our response to that is illustrative of both the denial and delay process and the likely form our response to this crisis will take. TED.com: The global power shift . When we look at history we tend to see the progress of events as inevitable, but it was rarely so at the time. Indeed, the UK's powerful response to Hitler and the United States' equally extraordinary mobilization after Pearl Harbor both followed long years of denial and debate. Many argued that the threat wasn't that great, the response would be too expensive to afford, the public wouldn't support it. Sound familiar? But when the response came, when the scale of the threat was finally accepted, our response was breathtaking. As Churchill told his country: ""It is no use saying, 'We are doing our best.' You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary."" With denial gone, governments knew what was ""necessary."" They directed industry to support the war -- banning civilian auto production just four days after Pearl Harbor. They raised massive amounts of money to fund investment and technology research at an extraordinary scale -- indeed, U.S. spending on the war rose from 1.6% of GDP in 1940 to 37% just five years later. To achieve this, they curtailed personal consumption and drove remarkable behavior change to free up financial and other resources for the war effort. Do you find this hard to imagine today? Then try to imagine the alternative -- that in a collapsing global economy and society we will stand by and simply watch the slide. There is no precedent in modern history on which to base that conclusion and plenty of evidence for the alternative. Humanity may be slow, but we are not stupid. Get ready for the great disruption. Â The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Gilding.","Paul Gilding: The demands we place on the environment far exceed its capacity .

"(CNN) -- Ed Koch, the brash former New York City mayor who typically greeted constituents with a ""How'm I doin'?"" died Friday at the age of 88, his spokesman said. Koch died of congestive heart failure, spokesman George Arzt said. The former mayor felt very tired Thursday morning and was admitted to the intensive care unit, Artz said. Koch lost consciousness that afternoon and passed away around 2 a.m. Friday. The lawyer-turned-public servant was a U.S. congressman from 1968 until he ran for mayor of the city in 1977. He served three terms until David Dinkins defeated him in a Democratic primary. New York City has lost ""an irrepressible icon,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement. ""In elected office and as a private citizen, he was our most tireless, fearless, and guileless civic crusader,"" Bloomberg said. ""We will miss him dearly, but his good works -- and his wit and wisdom -- will forever be a part of the city he loved so much."" Koch told New York magazine in 1998: ""I think my personality was helpful in this job. I always had a great sense of humor, though I am also pretty reserved personally. I mean, I don't go to chichi parties; never did. I don't like going to dinners other than small dinners at the homes of people. But I realized that if I was to harness the energies of the people of the city of New York and give them back their pride, I would have to become bigger than life. And I did."" Tweeters loved Koch's 'New York-iness' After he left office, Koch -- whose ebullient personality made him popular nationwide -- practiced law, hosted a radio show, was a newspaper columnist and made countless appearances on TV series as himself. His cameos included ""Sex and the City,"" ""Spin City"" and ""Picket Fences."" For two years starting in 1997, he was the judge on the syndicated show ""The People's Court."" He also reviewed movies online at The Mayor at the Movies site (mayorkoch.com). In his later years, Koch became politically motivated again. In 2011, he grew upset after President Barack Obama called for Israel to return to its pre-1967 borders, with land swaps, as the basis of a Mideast peace deal. In his anger, Koch crossed party lines to support Republican Bob Turner in his bid to represent perhaps the most Jewish district in the country, which covers parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Koch's endorsement was widely seen as a turning point in a race that few expected a Republican to win. On the day of the special election, Turner won in an upset with 54% of the vote, with Koch standing next to him while he gave his victory speech. ""I like President Obama ... I helped get him elected,"" Koch said at Turner's election night party. ""But he threw Israel under the bus."" But in September 2011, Koch said he was impressed with Obama's handling of the Palestinian bid for statehood at the U.N., where the president expressed support for Israel and called for more negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. ""I congratulated him on his speech to the United Nations in which he acknowledged Israel's presence in a difficult neighborhood,"" Koch said, referring to a party he attended that was hosted by Obama and his wife, Michelle, in New York. Edward Irving Koch was born in the Bronx on December 12, 1924. The family moved to New Jersey when he was 8. He went to the City College of New York until he was drafted into the Army in 1943. After he left the service as a sergeant in 1946, he studied law at New York University. He began his public service life as a district leader in Greenwich Village in 1963; he also served on the New York City Council before running for Congress. Opinion: Koch a friend and force to the end . The New York Times said in a 2011 retrospective that Koch seemed an unlikely candidate for mayor in 1977. ""He was a geeky, relatively obscure congressman, considered too liberal to appeal beyond his Greenwich Village constituency,"" the Times said on its website. His campaign manager, David Garth, came up with a slogan that helped Koch beat fellow Democrat Mario Cuomo, who many commentators viewed as the more dynamic character, and Republican Roy Goodman. ''After eight years of charisma and four years of the clubhouse, why not try competence?"" was a slogan that spoke to New Yorkers who were disappointed by Koch's predecessors, John Lindsay and Abe Beame. Koch was a popular mayor -- winning a second term with 75% of the vote and a third with 78% -- but as the Times put it: ""With New Yorkers wearying of his in-your-face shtick and seeking a balm to racial polarization, Mr. Koch was defeated for the Democratic nomination by Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins."" Before he was defeated by Dinkins, he criticized the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a candidate for president in 1988, and some felt he angered many black voters. Race relations in New York were also fractured at the time, especially after a 1986 incident in Howard Beach when white teenagers attacked three black men, killing one. Koch's third term was beset by corruption scandals involving his political allies. Koch himself was never directly tied to wrongdoing, but the scandals hurt Koch's image with voters. Only three New York mayors were ever re-elected twice -- Fiorello LaGuardia and Robert Wagner were the others -- and all three left office, as The New York Times put it in 2008, ""drained, diminished and disdained."" Some new Yorkers thought Koch, who published an autobiography in 1984, had lost control of his ego. Koch even said he lost because ""voters got tired of me."" Koch, who never married, was often criticized by playwright, novelist and LGBT rights advocate Larry Kramer for not doing more to stop the spread of AIDS in New York. ""He was a closeted gay man, and he did not want in any way to be associated with this,"" Kramer declared to New York magazine. Koch found discussions of his sexuality to be humorous. ""Listen, there's no question that some New Yorkers think I'm gay, and voted for me nevertheless. The vast majority don't care, and others don't think I am. And I don't give a (expletive) either way!"" he told New York magazine. There will be a funeral on Monday.

"(CNN) -- The going idea is that texting has, in essence, made graffiti a universal pastime: Barely punctuated, sparsely capitalized and with decidedly creative spellings throughout, texting means that today's America is reveling in writing badly. Ten years ago (we'll soon get to why it would only be back then) the proper answer to this would have been LOL -- ""laughing out loud"" -- because in reality, texting is sprouting new grammar all the time. Yes, grammar, as subtle and sophisticated as subjunctives and such. Take LOL. Today, it wouldn't signify amusement the way it did when it first caught on. Jocelyn texts ""where have you been?"" and Annabelle texts back ""LOL at the library studying for two hours."" How funny is that, really? Or an exchange such as ""LOL theres only one slice left"" / ""don't deprive me LOL"" -- text exchanges often drip with these LOL's the way normal writing drips with commas. Let's face it -- no mentally composed human being spend his or her entire life immersed in ceaseless hilarity. The LOLs must mean something else. They do. They signal basic empathy between texters. What began as signifying laughter morphed into easing tension and creating a sense of equality. Watch John McWhorter's TED Talk . That is, ""LOL"" no longer ""means"" anything. Rather, it ""does something"" -- conveying an attitude -- just as the ending ""-ed"" doesn't ""mean"" anything but conveys past tense. LOL is, of all things, grammar. Of course, no texter thinks about that consciously. But then most of communication operates below the radar, where things tend not to mean what they would literally. Over time, the meaning of a word or an expression drifts. ""Meat"" used to mean any kind of food. ""Silly"" used to mean, believe it or not, blessed. We can see LOL-type expressions happening in speech. ""I know, right?"" means little; it assures the listener of agreement and acknowledgment. Or, there is the phrase ""You know what I'm sayin'?"" used most in what is best known as ""Ebonics,"" but increasingly by young people of various shades and demographics. TED.com: Q&A with John McWhorter . Technically, it is composed of seven words: do, you, know, what, I, am, and saying. However, it is now more often pronounced as two syllables -- ""noam sayin'?"" -- or sometimes even just a single one, roughly: ""Msehn?"" It, too, is now a piece of grammar, soliciting the same sense of empathy and group membership that LOL does. LOL is one of several texting expressions that convey nuance in a system where you don't have the voice and face to do it the way you normally would. Civilization, then, is fine. People banging away on their smartphones are fluently using a code separate from the one they use in actual writing, but a code it is, to which linguists are currently devoting articles. People have been warning us that language was going to the dogs ever since Latin started turning into French. Yet the dogs in question never seem to emerge yelping on the horizon. TED.com: Steven Pinker on what our language habits reveal . There is no evidence that texting is ruining composition skills. Worldwide, people speak differently than they write, and texting -- quick, casual and only intended to be read once -- is actually a way of talking with your fingers. All indications are that America's youth are doing it quite well. Texting is not the mangling of language -- it's the birth of a new one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John McWhorter.","John McWhorter: People see the language of texting as a sign of bad writing .

"(CNN) -- The language of war leaves something lost in translation. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon on Saturday spoke of ""achievements"" and the destruction of ""significant targets"" in his country's airstrikes against Hamas targets in Gaza. But on the ground in Gaza, sources talked with CNN not about military targets, but about hospitals pushed to the brink, dead or distressed children, and airstrikes that struck water infrastructure. ""No one is talking about the Palestinian civilians. When you bring up this story, no one is ready to listen,"" a Hamas spokesman, Osama Hamdan, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""But when it came to Israelis, everyone is taking care and everyone is talking."" Though a full-scale invasion has not occurred, Israeli military forces went into Gaza for half an hour early Sunday and raided a long-range missile launching site, an Israeli military source told CNN. Gunfire was exchanged and four Israeli soldiers were ""lightly injured,"" the source said, adding that the mission was accomplished. The death toll from the airstrikes on Gaza this week has topped 160, Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry, said early Sunday. More than 1,100 people have been injured. On Saturday, at least 23 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes, said security and medical sources in Gaza. An official at Shifa Hospital told CNN that the morgue there was now full. One airstrike targeted the house of the head of the Gaza police, Tayseer al-Batsh, and killed at least 15 people and injured an unknown number of others, security sources in Gaza told CNN. Aqsa TV showed rescuers frantically digging for survivors. The airstrikes hit the house, which is next to a mosque. The sources say that some of the casualties had been in evening prayers at the mosque. And, an Israeli airstrike hit a facility housing the disabled, killing two women, the health ministry said Saturday. Israel Defense Forces said it was looking into that claim. Four Israeli airstrikes hit the Arafat Police complex in Gaza city early Sunday, shaking nearby buildings, including the offices of CNN and other media. The Israeli military is telling residents of northern Gaza to evacuate their homes for their own safety, CNN correspondent Ben Wedemen reported Saturday. Israel Defense Forces says it uses phone calls and drops empty shells on roofs -- what it calls ""roof knocking"" -- to warn civilians that airstrikes are imminent. Concerns about a ground invasion by Israeli forces are growing. The U.N. Security Council on Saturday called for a de-escalation and cease-fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, the 15-member group said in a statement. Israel's stated mission is to get Hamas militants to stop firing rockets into Israel, something that has not happened. Even after days of bombardments from Israeli jets, more than 36 rockets were fired from Gaza on Saturday, and the sun had not even set. Two of those rockets were intercepted by Israeli air defense, and 34 struck Israel. The IDF said at least two rockets fired from Lebanon hit open areas north of coastal Nahariya, but no damage or injuries were reported. Israel asserts its right to defend itself, and so far the Hamas rockets have caused no deaths. ""Achievements are accumulating in terms of the price that Hamas is paying, and we are continuing to destroy significant targets belonging to Hamas and other terrorist organizations,"" Ya'alon said. ""Hamas is suffering from severe blows and is causing severe damage to its people."" Hamas frames the current conflict as a defensive fight. ""What about the right for the Palestinians to protect themselves to protect their people?"" Hamdan said. ""The international solution is asking Israel to leave but they're not doing that."" Electricity and water sources affected . More than 500 homes in Gaza have been destroyed or severely damaged, more than 3,000 Palestinians are displaced and hundreds of thousands have been affected by damage to water infrastructure, a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) told CNN. Electricity is knocked out in major areas of Gaza City, and at least one major line was struck, repaired and promptly struck again, spokesman Chris Gunness said. Nine UNRWA schools have been damaged, he said. (On Saturday, some UMRWA warehouses caught on fire, but the cause was a militant rocket that fell short and struck on Palestinian territory.) At least 28 Palestinian children have lost their lives in the recent fighting, and others are beginning to show signs of mental distress, said Catherine Weibel, communications chief for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Israel says, as of Saturday, its military has attacked 1,220 ""terror targets,"" including 632 launchers, 130 military camps, 106 ""terror infrastructure"" and 220 tunnels. That level of specificity has little meaning in Gaza, where a public utility official told CNN that water, not terror, infrastructure has been hit. Two Gaza water wells took direct hits Saturday, Gaza director of public water Maher Salem said. These water sources, which supply water to 27,000 people, ""no longer exist,"" he said. No de-escalation . Though some Israelis have been wounded, none have been killed by the hundreds of rockets fired by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza. Israel's Iron Dome defense system has intercepted dozens of rockets, helping keep fatalities at bay. Hostilities between the two sides escalated this month after the killing of three Israeli teenagers and a Palestinian teen. Neither Hamas nor Israel appear to be backing down, prompting fears of a ground invasion by the latter. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left all possibilities open, saying the international community will not influence his actions against Hamas. He reiterated that there is one path to a cease-fire: the cessation of attacks from Gaza. The language seems clear -- each side demands the other to stop -- but it seems the two sides can't hear each other while they have their hands pressed on the ""launch"" button. In another incident Saturday, an Israeli airstrike killed six Palestinians in Gaza City, according to local medical sources. An Israeli airstrike hit a group of people near Khan Younis, killing a young girl and injuring five others, according to medical and security sources in Gaza. Attackers in Gaza opened fire and damaged an IDF vehicle patrolling the security fence in northern Gaza, the IDF said. What's next? On Saturday, not all of the rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel. At least two rockets hit open areas in the West Bank. The IDF reported that it has called up more than 35,600 reservists. They are authorized to call up to 40,000. As concerns of a ground invasion by Israeli forces grow, foreigners in Gaza are planning their exit. One of the only crossing points between Israel and Gaza, at Erez, has received about 800 requests by civilians with foreign citizenship to leave, officials there told CNN. The 800 requests have come in over the past three days and have been approved, a crossing official said. That figure includes about 300 Americans, though that number is unofficial, the source said. Medical sources described overcrowded emergency rooms in Gaza and dwindling stocks of medicine, a situation that mirrored Syrian hospitals at the height of its civil war. At one damaged hospital, eight activists formed a human shield in an attempt to protect it. The activists who formed a human shield are from various countries, including the United States, Venezuela, Belgium, Britain and Switzerland, said Dr. Basman Al-Ashi, executive director of the Al-Wafa hospital. He said the hospital caters to patients who need 24-hour care, and thus cannot evacuate them. Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza are believed to have about 10,000 rockets of varying ranges, according to the Israeli military. Israel has said some 3.5 million residents live in areas within reach of the rockets. CNN's Kareem Khadder, Tal Heinrich, Khalil Abdallah and Yon Pomrenze in Jerusalem, Talal Abu Rahma in Gaza, and Samira Said and Faith Karimi in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: Israeli forces invade a Gaza missile site Sunday, then return .

"(CNN) -- More than two million people are dying every year from the effects of outdoor air pollution, according to a new study. An estimated 2.1 million deaths are caused by anthropogenic increases of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) while a further 470,000 are killed annually as a result of human-caused increases in ozone pollution. Jason West, co-author of the study published in the journal of Environmental Research Letters said: ""Outdoor air pollution is an important problem and among the most important environmental risk factors for health."" East Asia is the worst affected area with researchers estimating more than a million people dying prematurely every year from PM2.5 pollution and 203,000 from ozone pollution. India has the second highest air pollution mortality rates with an estimated 397,000 deaths from fine particulates and ozone accounting for, on average, 118,000. Next comes Southeast Asia which has estimated average of 158,000 deaths from PM2.5 and 33,300 attributed to ozone. Europe has fractionally less PM2.5 deaths (154,000, on average) and 32,800 premature deaths related to ozone while in North America there were an average of 43,000 deaths from fine particulates and 34,400 related to ozone. West et al used an ensemble of global atmospheric chemistry climate models to estimate concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone pollutants. Fine particulate matter (dust, soot, smoke and liquid droplets) is classified as less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. It is particularly dangerous to human health because it can lodge deep in the lungs causing cancer and other respiratory disease, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Ground level ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight, say the EPA. The study also investigated the effects of climate change on worsening air pollution, comparing climate models from the year 2000 with pre-industrial times (1850). ""Very few studies have attempted to estimate the effects of past climate change on air quality and health. We found that the effects of past climate change are likely to be a very small component of the overall effect of air pollution,"" said West, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""Going forward into the future, climate change will get more severe and that could have greater effects on air pollution."" The research adds to a growing body of evidence revealing both the human and economic impacts of air pollution around the world. A recent report published in the British medical journal, The Lancet found that the incidence of heart failure rises when air pollution is higher. The research, funded by the British Heart Foundation, concluded that a reduction of PM2.5 could reduce hospitalizations due to heart failure in the U.S. saving a third of a billion dollars per year. Another recent study published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences highlighted air pollution problems in Northern China, suggesting life expectancy could have been lowered by five-and-a-half years. Even in the European Union, air pollution takes a sizable 8.6-month chunk off life expectancy according to the World Health Organization. But technology to monitor air pollution is improving all the time, says Roland Leigh, an air quality scientist from the UK's University of Leicester. ""Historically, air quality is something very much we've tried to measure and manage spatially -- considering over a total city what the average air quality is. What we are getting to now is systems that let us manage the distribution of air quality with knowledge of where people are and what people are doing,"" Leigh told CNN. Improved data can help manage the exposure of sensitized individuals (the young, asthma sufferers, the elderly), he says. But he concedes that the road to improved air quality might be a long one. ""We have come to terms with the fact that in the urban environment we get exposed to emissions by our transport systems. That transport system is essential and at the moment there is no economically viable way of not emitting pollution at the point of use. ""Either we have to manage those emissions and exposure more intelligently or technologies need to change in our cars.""","Air pollution responsible for more than two million premature deaths worldwide annually .

"(CNN) -- Mention Morocco and most would first think of the exotic markets of Marrakech, the desert dotted with ancient kasbahs and, of course, the classic 1942 wartime film ""Casablanca."" But Casablanca, the main port city of Morocco, is among the places being tipped by experts as emerging future global financial centers. As the gateway between Europe and Africa, Casablanca aims to take advantage of its geographical position and also act as a hub for North, West and Central Africa, said Hicham Zegrary, director of operations and institutional affairs at the Casablanca Finance City Authority (CFCA). The CFCA is working hard to position Casablanca as an international financial center, he said, by building its technology infrastructure and improving the legal environment in which business is done. Zegrary added that due to Morocco's many partners throughout Europe, North America and Asia, for investors ""it is easier to do business with African countries from Morocco."" Since its inception four years ago, the CFCA says it has attracted over 50 companies including BNP Paribas, AIG, Clifford Chance, Silk Invest and Boston Consulting Group to name a few. While Casablanca's ranking is still relatively low overall (62 out of 83) in a recent Global Financial Center Index report, it's significant that it debuted on the list and it signals a larger growth in the region. What's more, GFCI asked international financial services professionals which cities they believed will likely become more significant in the next few years: Casablanca was the name that came up most. ""They're putting a lot of work into it there,"" said Mark Yeandle, associate director of Z/Yen Group, the company who published the GFCI report earlier this year on global financial centers. ""They have a sensible budget and a good team,"" he added. Casablanca is building its infrastructure and rebranding itself as a hub for financial services needed in Morocco, Tunis, and even further away in Lagos, Nigeria. ""It (Casablanca) will be as good as any,"" said Yeandle. Another newcomer and fairly unknown city is Busan, South Korea, which has traditionally operated in Seoul's shadow. It ranks 27th on the GFCI report, just behind number 26 Qatar. But it ranks second only to Casablanca as a place tipped by finance professionals as likely become more significant. Busan has the fifth busiest port in the world, not to mention the largest department store in the world, despite the fact that many people have never even heard of it. ""Busan are putting a great deal of money and promotional activity behind their growth as a financial center,"" said Yeandle. ""They are building a dedicated area for the center and are publicizing their focus on maritime finance and derivatives trading."" Read this: How to start your own currency . For different reasons, another Asian future contender is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. While operating relatively quietly in comparison to its southern neighbor Singapore, what sets Kuala Lumpur apart from others, says Saif Malik, managing director and head of corporate and institutional clients for Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia, is that it's quickly becoming a leading financial center for Islamic banking, which operates with a different set of rules to traditional banking. ""There is clearly a plan,"" said Malik. ""It's not an overnight journey, but the Malaysians have realized to compete with Singapore and other long-established financial centers, they have the niche in Islamic banking."" Islamic finance has seen recent growth two to three times faster than conventional banks, according to Ernst and Young in its World Islamic Banking Competitiveness Report. The global financial crisis and strong economic growth in countries with a large Muslim population are both reasons for such progress. Unlike neighboring Jakarta, Indonesia, Kuala Lumpur stands out as having a more stable political and economic environment. Malik says the Malaysian government has made great efforts to attract a skilled workforce while at the same time working in a trusted legal environment originating from the British legal system. In the 10 years to 2015, it is projected that the Malaysian banking industry will have an annual growth rate of approximately 9%, said Malik, and the government has stepped up with various initiatives to promote foreign direct investments into the country, including the InvestKL program which aims to attract talent and build Kuala Lumpur into a global city. While the Middle East continues to grow, particularly Qatar and Dubai, so do cities in China, especially if mainland China's ongoing currency issues around the Renminbi become open and transparent, said Yeandle. ""The wealth there has to go somewhere. It's almost inevitable,"" he said, mentioning Shenzhen, Dalian, Shanghai and Beijing, as current and future financial hubs. In Latin America, massive growth is happening too, according to the GFCI report. Buenos Aires, Argentina, takes the clear lead, jumping 21 places to become 25th on the list despite the economic and political uncertainty in the country. Yeandle says that though Buenos Aires is unpredictable, ""the long-term trend will probably be upward."" While the same can't be said for many continental European cities. Rome, for example, saw the biggest drop on the GFCI list, falling 19 places to number 54. Paris, Milan, Madrid and Athens, have all seen enormous dips in their rankings since the decline of the Eurozone. Luxembourg, however, is holding strong and tipped to grow due to more lenient tax schemes attractive to companies, said Yeandle, and Zurich continues its reign as a financial hub thanks to its independence from the Eurozone. But one point overall, says Yeandle, despite any newcomers on the rise, there are certain ingredients which make cities successful in the rankings and will continue to do so. ""If you look at the (current) top four (New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore), they are all very cosmopolitan, welcoming to foreigners, they attract talented expats and they are successful cities and attractive cities,"" he said. Perhaps a note for all cities hoping to climb in the ranks of future financial hubs: ""You have to be a successful city in order to be a successful financial center,"" said Yeandle.

"(CNN) -- The new video released by Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau makes a simple demand: He won't release the more than 200 schoolgirls his group abducted from a school northern Nigeria ""until after you release our brethren."" The ""brethren"" he refers to include several hundred Boko Haram fighters, including key commanders, currently held in jails in Nigeria, as well as in Niger and Cameroon. It is a demand that he has made before, and a demand that, crucially, the Nigerian government has at least once conceded. Almost exactly a year ago, fighters from Boko Haram entered a dusty town close to the border with Cameroon. They headed for the police station, army barracks and prison buildings. The dawn raid on May 7, 2013, on the town of Bama left more than 100 people dead, including many civilians. The Boko Haram fighters freed about 100 inmates from the prison. But -- little reported at the time -- they also abducted about a dozen women and children to use as bargaining chips, according to Jacob Zenn, an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation and long-time observer of Boko Haram. Days after the Bama raid, Boko Haram's Shekau appeared in a video that showed the hostages. He warned that if Nigerian security forces ""do not release our wives and children, we will not release theirs,"" and the hostages would become his ""servants,"" according to Zenn, who provided CNN a link to the video. According to Zenn, among the women and children allegedly held by Nigerian authorities were Shekau's wife and three children, the wife of Boko Haram's commander in the town of Kano and his children, and the wife of the group's commander in the town of Sokoto. The tactic appears to have worked. Two weeks later, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan directed that women and children ""in detention on suspicion of involvement"" with Boko Haram would be freed from prison. The hostages held by Boko Haram were released or, according to the official version, ""rescued"" by security forces. Zenn told CNN that altogether nearly 100 Boko Haram members and their relatives were set free -- and that Nigerian security sources told him there was a financial payoff by the government to the group to close the deal. It's now clear that in conceding to a key Boko Haram demand, the Nigerian government was inviting more such abductions. And as Nigeria detained more of the group's members and sympathizers, Boko Haram's determination to secure their freedom increased. The video that Shekau recorded after the Bama attack last year has striking similarities to the one obtained by Agence France Presse on Monday -- in which he demands the release of all Boko Haram members in jail in return for the freedom of more than 200 girls kidnapped last month. Zenn said ""Shekau wants all Boko Haram prisoners freed because they because they will have renewed loyalty to him, and him alone"" after internal rifts in 2012 and 2013. ""And the militants freed from prison will allow Boko Haram to benefit from their bomb-making and kidnapping skills to launch new and fiercer attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon and the border region,"" he said. A behind-the-scenes payment could help the group recruit members and purchase weapons, as well as buy ""loyalty from tribal elders in the Nigeria-Cameroon border area,"" Zenn said. Boko Haram has additional reasons to believe kidnapping can be lucrative. Early last year, a group of its fighters crossed into Cameroon and abducted a French family on safari. Shekau showed off the family -- just like he has shown off other hostages -- in video obtained by AFP in March 2013. ""We are holding them hostage because the leaders of Cameroon and Nigeria detained our women and children under inhumane conditions,"" he said. After secret negotiations between Shekau and the Cameroonian government (through intermediaries), Boko Haram released the family near the Nigerian-Cameroon border -- reportedly in exchange for a $3 million ransom and the release of 16 Boko Haram prisoners held in Cameroon. By resolving the current crisis and securing the girls' freedom, the government would likely be sowing the seeds of another. But by pursuing the military option, it could endanger the lives of many of the girls, who are thought to have been split into groups and possibly smuggled across the border into Cameroon and Chad. Even if the Nigerian military tracks down and frees one group, Boko Haram might take revenge by killing others. As for its longer-term goals, Shekau said Boko Haram will not negotiate a cease-fire until it ""brings the Nigerian government to its knees."" In terms of a political settlement in return for an end to violence, Boko Haram has not outlined its goals. Zenn believes the group ""would likely demand a de-facto Taliban-like Islamic State in some portion of northeastern Nigeria and the border region,"" a demand that would be unpalatable to the federal government because it would damage the already shaky integrity of Africa's most populous nation. But Zenn said it's notable that in the latest video, the girls (at least some of whom are likely Christians) are forced to wear the hijab and that a flag behind them is typical of al Qaeda affiliates. ""The appearance of them 'unharmed' makes it look like Boko Haram is doing this for legitimate Islamic purposes to win a prisoner exchange -- as opposed to sex slavery."" In the video, Shekau states: ""Everything that we are doing is in the Quran and in the Hadith (sayings attributed to the Prophet Mohammed.)"" Many have objected to that assessment and last year a group called Civilian Joint Task Force -- set up to counter Boko Haram in northern Nigeria -- said they rescued 26 abducted women and girls, some of whom were pregnant, or had given birth, according to Human Rights Watch. ""Many girls who were rescued or had escaped were sent off by their families to distant cities like Abuja and Lagos to avoid the stigma of rape or pregnancy outside of marriage,"" activists said, according to a report from Human Rights Watch. According to the Human Rights Watch report, residents of Maiduguri said that on several occasions, members of Boko Haram forcefully abducted several teenage girls. HRW quoted one man who had documented such cases: ""After storming into the homes and throwing sums of money at their parents, with a declaration that it was the dowry for their teenage daughter, they would take the girls away."" Another said: When we made Maiduguri ""too hot"" for Boko Haram, they ran away without their wives. ""Now they are picking up women anywhere and using them to satisfy themselves.""","Boko Haram demands release of its fighters for return of abducted Nigerian schoolgirls .

"(CNN) -- Ahead of the rain-lashed vehicles, tree branches lay across the road. We'd encountered countless military, police and vigilante checkpoints but now we were in Boko Haram's backyard, we worried if the checkpoints were being replaced by ambushes. After the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls from a school in northern Nigeria, the whole world's attention was focused on one village - Chibok -- but CNN was the first news organization to send a team to the scene of the atrocity. Setting up interviews with those impacted by the mass abduction was quite a task, but once in place, the bigger challenge became ""how do we safely get there."" I have covered conflict zones before and always focus on the stories we'll hope to get, rather than the potential danger. That's how I deal with the fear. We were trying to find security escorts, but no one was willing to journey to Chibok, which is situated in Borno State -- one of the three states considered to be the heartland of Boko Haram. The militant Islamist group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders. It was unlikely they would welcome Western journalists, and those accompanying us, with open arms. The journey from the relative safety of Nigeria's capital, Abuja, to the remote countryside stalked by Boko Haram can take 8 to 10 hours, but logistics and security concerns meant that it took us four days. We traveled in two cars -- 4x4s to handle the terrain. Even before we reached the militant-plagued area, we suffered setbacks. In Bauchi State, a tire on the first car blew-out, causing it to lose control. Now we were down one car. It was hours before we could find a resident willing to lend his rundown car to us and to travel to Chibok. Eventually this car broke down and had to be abandoned. 'Why did I come?' When we entered Borno State, we were hit by a violent storm. We could see absolutely nothing as strong rains lashed our vehicles. Night had fallen, we were still far away from our destination of the state capital Maiduguri and our driver was unfamiliar with the road. We couldn't see to the side, behind or ahead. While covering stories in other conflict zones, there have been instances when the danger was so apparent that I wondered - ""Why did I come?"" For this story, it was that night as we entered Borno State -- in the dark during a strong storm. The situation was all the more eerie because the storm had brought down branches across the road and we wondered if we were being set up for an ambush. Eventually, however, we did arrive in the relative safety of Maiduguri, the state's capital, only to encounter another hurdle. We had organized a police escort to accompany us for the final, most dangerous leg from Maiduguri south to Chibok. The road is notorious for ambushes and attacks by Boko Haram. As we readied to journey along it on our third day, our police escort said they could not take us because that morning it had been the scene of a shootout between the militants -- who had come from raiding a village - and security forces. One of the officials had been shot in the neck. Beyond the checkpoints . By the time we left with a police escort the following day, it was about noon. Our route had all been tarmac until the town of Damboa, from where the road leads to Chibok. From that point, there's no tarmac whatsoever. Drivers are forced to swerve left and right to avoid the potholes caused by the heat and it's really rough terrain -- savannah. Damboa also hosted the last security checkpoint we encountered. Prior to that we had been forced to stop constantly. There would be a military checkpoint, a few minutes later a police checkpoint and then a few minutes later a vigilante checkpoint -- staffed by local men armed with machetes looking out for Boko Haram. But on the road to the village now the focus of the whole world's attention because of the atrocity that took place there -- there was nothing, not one checkpoint. We were driving through a vast area of open land, high grass and shrubs. And there was no homestead in sight. Any checkpoint set up by the security forces would basically make them sitting ducks for the insurgents. Our convoy was on its own. Our police escorts were armed with AK-47 rifles and we had flak jackets on the seats beside us -- kept out of sight so as not to raise questions about our purpose -- but our main defense was to drive as fast as possible along the pitted road for the 45-minute journey. A number of thoughts went through my mind; this was the road to Chibok; militants could storm us from anywhere on that road. It was a very scary moment. And at the same time I kept thinking, ""how is it possible that there is no single security check point towards this village? Not even one?"" Arriving in Chibok we found a spread-out village with a vibrant market with residents buying and selling food stuffs. The most popular stand, however, is the phone charging stand - because there is no power in the homes. Overnight stay . Our late departure meant we had arrived in Chibok around 3pm and the police said it was too dangerous to return along the same road so we had to sleep over in the village. That wasn't part of the plan. Ever. We were offered guest huts to stay in. But we declined as our presence would be so obvious -- and of course we didn't want to be with the police because if there was an attack that would be where a shootout would be. A very brave local family hosted us, providing us with mats to sleep outside. A village that has lost so much still found reserves of humanity to offer us hospitality. During the day, Chibok looks like a normal village. But at night is when you see the fear and terror. The women, elderly and children go to sleep. And the young men stay awake, doing patrols, keeping vigil. CNN's team joined them, and discovered that one thing was clear: Chibok residents have stopped waiting for the government, they are protecting their own.

"(CNN) -- Very soon, you will be sick of slow-motion videos. They will fill up your Facebook, Instagram and Vine feeds. The amateur clips will show pets jumping and playing, objects falling and breaking, and people dancing about in glorious, high-quality slow motion. You can blame the iPhone. Slow-motion video is the most addictive feature of the new iPhone 5S (turns out fingerprint scans are useful but not really ""fun""). The camera can shoot 120 frames per second (regular video is typically 30 frames per second) and then slow down all or part of the video to show details that would usually have sped right by. This technique is so cool that the Discovery Channel had a whole series devoted to it. ""Time Warp"" employed extremely high-speed cameras and then slowed the footage way down to examine principles of physics. Apparently, it's also cute for weddings. The camera is always one of the primary reasons people choose to upgrade to a new iPhone, right up there with overall speed. With each generation of phone, Apple has made incremental upgrades to the camera's hardware and software, such as the ability to shoot video, to use a flash or to snap panoramic images. Here's a closer look at the key features of the iPhone 5S camera: . Low-light performance . For the iPhone 5S, Apple improved overall image quality by expanding by 15% the amount of sensor space the camera uses to capture pictures. Apple kept the camera at 8 megapixels but made the existing pixels larger, resulting in better low-light performance. Shooting photos in low-light settings is an area where all smartphones can use a little improvement. Nighttime photos are often grainy or murky because of slow shutter speeds, small sensors and shoddy flashes. The 5S has noticeably improved its low-light performance with the larger pixels and by adding auto-image stabilization, which corrects for shaky hands. It also replaces the iPhone 5's old single flash with a new two-light system called True-Tone Flash. Instead of washing out a scene with a single flood of light, the new system takes a pre-flash to decide what the color temperature should be and then chooses the appropriate settings for cool and warm light. There are 1,000 potential lighting combinations, and while it's still a far cry from a professional flash, it's a big improvement. Burst Mode . Just as every camera is a little better, every iPhone is a little faster. This round, there's a powerful A7 chip inside. The camera feels faster as a result, especially when you switch over to a new feature called Burst Mode. Pressing and holding the shutter button now takes a rapid series of shots -- 10 frames per second, up to 999 total images. If you're taking a photo of a fast-moving subject or want to be sure you don't miss a fleeting moment, Burst Mode covers all the bases. It even helps you pick the best shots from the bunch by looking for things such as sharpness, smiles and whether a subject's eyes are open. There's a bit of an adjustment period with this new feature. On the old iPhones, you would hold down the shutter button until you were ready to capture an image, then lift your finger to capture it. Now you can accidentally end up with 45 photos of a sunset. Other features . The new camera also contains a handful of smaller improvements, including a feature that crops images into squares and adds filters, Ã  la Instagram. In a final touch, the panorama feature -- available since the iPhone 5 -- can now subtly change the exposure as you pan across a scene. Slow motion is still the most fun new feature, but it's also the most frustrating when it comes to sharing. The files are large, so there are a few hurdles you must jump to upload the clips directly to Instagram or some other platforms. For example, you first must run the image through one of the phone's share-screen options, which include Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Mail. The phone-camera battle . The iPhone 5S is not the first smartphone to get these features. In fact, Samsung's Galaxy S4 has slow motion, a mode for shooting action and many other camera extras not included on the iPhone, including the ability to speed up video clips and make animated GIFs. Owners of the iPhone 5S can add some of these missing features through third-party apps, however. The iPhone 5S does not even have the most powerful camera hardware. That honor goes to the Nokia Lumia 1020, which packs a much-hyped, powerful 41-megapixel camera, great for zooming in on images taken from a distance. What Apple does have is a great alternative to a point-and-shoot in a popular operating system on coveted hardware. At this point, it's pretty much a given that smartphones have severely wounded the market for point-and-shoot cameras. In the first half of 2013, point-and-shoot sales shipments were down 42% from the same period last year, according to the Camera and Imaging Products Association. That tumble follows years of declining camera sales as smartphone manufacturers compete against each other for the best new camera features. For the average consumer, the real camera battle will continue to be between smartphone manufacturers as they struggle to improve a feature that's limited by space and technology. And Apple will continue making small camera improvements. Maybe the iPhone 6 will include a Frontback option. But for now, the slow-motion feature wins this round of iPhone upgrades.","The new iPhone 5S has a much-improved camera .

"(CNN) -- Hilary Duff says her new album is ""very positive"" but admits that it started out ""a lot heavier and a lot darker"" because of the separation from her husband, Mike Comrie. ""I'm separated from my husband right now, which has been a very difficult thing to go through,"" she told Billboard's ""Pop Shop"" podcast. ""In the beginning, the album was a lot heavier and a lot darker, because I had to get that out. Once I did get that out, a lot of fun came."" Duff married Comrie, a former pro hockey player, in 2010 after dating for three years. Their son, Luca, was born in 2012. Duff and Comrie announced their separation in January. Duff, 26, admits that she's ""nervous"" after being away from music for seven years. Her just-released single, ""Chasing the Sun,"" is from her still-untitled album, which will be her first studio release since 2007's ""Dignity."" She says she first started thinking of new material when she was pregnant with her son. After having the child and taking another year, she was even more anxious. ""I felt like I was missing a big part of myself,"" she said. Duff established a successful singing career on the heels of her popular Disney show, ""Lizzie McGuire,"" which aired from 2001 to 2004. She spent most of her teenage years touring and says that turning 20 was a big factor in leaving the road. ""It was time for me to be a person, and the break just ended up being a long time,"" she said. One song on the album has to do with the loneliness she felt after being surrounded by dozens of people during her peak. Another song is a collaboration with Ed Sheeran. Duff is upbeat about her music's prospects. ""It's an exciting new journey for me,"" she said.","Hilary Duff says some songs on new album are very personal .

"(CNN) -- Scientists say they've found a galaxy that's not just far, far, away -- it's the most distant from our own that's been discovered yet. And it's helping them gain insight about the universe as it existed a long time ago. Astronomers say the galaxy, called z8_GND_5296, is the most remote one they can confirm with spectroscopy, a technique that looks for the chemical signatures of elements. In this case, that element was hydrogen, the main fuel of stars. Researchers reported their findings in the journal Nature. z8_GND_5296 -- no, that's not a typo, or a spam username -- is a window into the past. Because of its distance, it shows what things would have been like 700 million years after the Big Bang. The universe is 13.8 billion years old, so 700 million years after the start is actually quite early by comparison. Star formation . Besides breaking the distance record, astronomers find the new galaxy exciting because it appears to produce stars at an unusually high rate, said lead study author Steven Finkelstein, assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. Star-formation rate is measured by how much raw hydrogen the galaxy converts into new stars every year. The z8_GND_5296 galaxy converts hydrogen in the amount of 300 times the mass of our sun into new stars each year. By contrast, the Milky Way only produces stars at one or two solar masses per year. Scientists established through previous research that in the first billion years of the universe's history, typical rate of star formation went up, Finkelstein said. Galaxies formed more and more stars over time until about 10 billion years ago, when star formation rates began to decrease. The newly-confirmed galaxy is still unusual in its high star-formation rate, given how far away it is. But one of the previous record holders for ""most distant galaxy"" was making stars at 100 solar masses per year, which is in the same ballpark, meaning z8_GND_5296 is not a total fluke in its prolific star-making. ""Now it's much less likely that we just stumbled upon a very rare phenomenon, and much more likely that the early universe harbors these sites of intense star formation, many more than we had previously thought possible,"" Finkelstein said. Shifting to red . All of the visible and ultraviolet light from the z8_GND_5296 galaxy has been shifted into the infrared spectrum by the time it reaches Earth. That's because the universe itself is expanding, and the stretching of space-time makes light waves stretch as well. This phenomenon, called ""red shift,"" is similar to the Doppler effect of sound -- for instance, the pitch of a police-car siren sounds higher when it's getting closer to you and lower as it moves away because the car is moving. The movement causes changes in the wavelength and frequency of sound waves that the observer receives. Astronomers can calculate the distance of a star, galaxy or other celestial object by examining how much light from it has been shifted into the infrared. This requires sophisticated techniques to make the calculations. In the Nature study, researchers used the MOSFIRE infrared camera at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study 43 galaxy candidates that had been found in a Hubble Space Telescope exploration of the sky: the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). Astronomers were looking for a special radiation signature from hydrogen called the Lyman-alpha emission line. This radiation represents the particular wavelength of light that gets emitted when hydrogen atoms get excited in a particular way. Researchers were able to detect this emission line coming from z8_GND_5296, but not from any of the other 42 candidates. What about those other candidates? Finkelstein theorizes that there is just a lot of gas that absorbs the hydrogen emissions, which is why we can't detect them on Earth. That may mean that ""galaxies at early epochs accrete gas at high rates, and that the resulting large amounts of gas extinguish most of the Lyman-alpha radiation in these young galaxies,"" Dominik Riechers, astronomer at Cornell University, wrote in an accompanying Nature ""News and Views"" article. ""We need much deeper observation to try to see this Lyman-alpha emission,"" Finkelstein said. More most-distant galaxies to come? Finkelstein and colleagues found this most distant galaxy on the first of two nights of observation, during a period of about six hours. They have applied for more nights at Keck for follow-up, so z8_GND_5296 may soon have competition for the distance record. Let's hope these far, far away galaxies don't have Star-Wars-ish civil wars.

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old Massachusetts boy accused of raping and killing his high school math teacher admitted to the crime, according to a search warrant affidavit released Monday. Philip Chism was indicted Friday on an additional count of aggravated rape in connection with the death of Colleen Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in the girls' bathroom of Danvers High School. He will be arraigned on the new count on Thursday. Chism pleaded not guilty in December to murder, aggravated rape and robbery charges stemming from the killing of the popular teacher. Police said a box cutter Chism had taken to school was the murder weapon. The affidavit, released Monday, said that after being booked in connection with the crime, Chism ""admitted to murdering"" his teacher. Chism, in the presence of his mother, Diana Chism, waived his Miranda rights. The affidavit also said Chism may have sought to ""memorialize"" the crime by photographing or videotaping parts of it with his cell phone, which was later destroyed in what investigators said was an attempt to hide incriminating evidence. The Essex County district attorney's office said Friday that it presented a grand jury with additional evidence. The new youthful offender indictment alleges that Chism forcibly had sexual intercourse with the victim. ""Aggravated rape is charged when there is serious bodily harm and/or when the rape was committed during the commission of another felonious and assaultive crime,"" the district attorney's office said in a statement. Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, could not be reached for comment. Chism, who is being held without bail, is set to appear January 30 in Salem Superior Court for a pre-trial conference. According to a police affidavit, a ninth-grade student told investigators that Chism became visibly upset when Ritzer spoke after class on the day of the crime about his home state of Tennessee. When Ritzer noticed that Chism was upset, she changed the subject, said the unidentified student, who described Chism as ""talking to himself."" The affidavit includes testimony from witnesses as well as a school video surveillance timeline showing Chism and Ritzer in the same area of the school during the teacher's final moments. In the video, Ritzer appears to enter a second-floor girls' restroom -- apparently, a faculty restroom was occupied -- and Chism, wearing gloves and red sweatshirt with the hood pulled over his head, appears to enter the restroom about a minute later, according to the affidavit. Shortly after, a female student enters the bathroom and then quickly walks out, according to the court papers. She told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes; the person's rear was exposed, with clothes piled on the floor. The video shows Chism leaving the restroom, returning later with a recycling barrel, and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead, the court papers say. He pulls the barrel outside the building and toward the student parking lot. Investigators said the video shows what appear to be blood stains near the bathroom and on Chism's pants. Court papers detail horrifying final moments of teacher's life . After Chism's mother reported him missing on the evening of October 22, police had his cell company ""ping"" the location of his phone. The phone was found to be in the vicinity of the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left. The affidavit said that, when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife; a search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded, ""The girl."" He was also allegedly carrying credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of woman's underwear. Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, the court papers said. Her throat was slit.

"(CNN) -- Scientists say they have proven the existence of the Higgs boson -- a never-before-seen subatomic particle long thought to be a fundamental building block of the universe. Since 2012 researchers have made great strides in the hunt for the so-called ""God particle"" at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, where scientists at the CERN particle physics laboratory are looking for particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies. Experts say finding the elusive particle would rank as one of the top scientific achievements of the past 50 years -- a view proved on Tuesday when Francois Englert and Peter Higgs, the two physicists who predicted almost 50 years ago that the particle existed, won the Nobel Prize in Physics. What is the Higgs boson? The Standard Model of particle physics lays out the basics of how elementary particles and forces interact in the universe. But the theory crucially fails to explain how particles actually get their mass. Particles, or bits of matter, range in size and can be larger or smaller than atoms. Electrons, protons and neutrons, for instance, are the subatomic particles that make up an atom. Scientists believe that the Higgs boson is the particle that gives all matter its mass. Read more: The woman at the edge of physics . Experts know that elementary particles like quarks and electrons are the foundation upon which all matter in the universe is built. They believe the elusive Higgs boson gives the particles mass and fills in one of the key holes in modern physics. How does the Higgs boson work? The Higgs boson is part of a theory first proposed by Higgs and others in the 1960s to explain how particles obtain mass. The theory proposes that a so-called Higgs energy field exists everywhere in the universe. As particles zoom around in this field, they interact with and attract Higgs bosons, which cluster around the particles in varying numbers. Imagine the universe like a party. Relatively unknown guests at the party can pass quickly through the room unnoticed; more popular guests will attract groups of people (the Higgs bosons) who will then slow their movement through the room. The speed of particles moving through the Higgs field works much in the same way. Certain particles will attract larger clusters of Higgs bosons -- and the more Higgs bosons a particle attracts, the greater its mass will be. Why is finding the Higgs boson so important? While finding the Higgs boson won't tell us everything we need to know about how the universe works, it will fill in a huge hole in the Standard Model that has existed for more than 50 years, according to experts. ""The Higgs boson is the last missing piece of our current understanding of the most fundamental nature of the universe,"" Martin Archer, a physicist at Imperial College in London, told CNN. ""Only now with the LHC [Large Hadron Collider] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'."" ""It's not the be all and end all -- but in terms of what can we say practically about the world and how the world is, it actually tells us a lot."" Gordon Kane, director of the Michigan Center for Theoretical Physics, added that finding evidence of the Higgs boson would be a ""very wonderful success of science and of people for four centuries."" Why is the Higgs boson called the ""God particle?"" The popular nickname for the elusive particle was created for the title of a book by Nobel Prize winning physicist Leon Lederman -- reportedly against his will, as Lederman has said he wanted to call it the ""Goddamn Particle"" because ""nobody could find the thing."" ""'God particle' is a nickname I don't really like,"" says Archer. ""It's nothing to do with religion -- the only (theoretical) similarity is you're seeing something that's a field that's everywhere, in all spaces."" How are scientists searching for the Higgs boson? For the past 18 months scientists have searched for the Higgs boson by smashing protons together at high energy in the $10 billion Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Inside the LHC, which is located 328 feet underground in a 17-mile tunnel and is the most powerful particle accelerator ever built, high speed proton collisions generate a range of even smaller particles that scientists sift through in search of a signal in the data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. ""You're just hoping that somewhere in these collisions that you see something ... some sort of a statistical bump,"" says Archer. So Higgs bosons exist, but are elusive, popping up and then disappearing again quickly. It means, says Archer, that scientists at the LHC are only able to observe their decaying remnants. Information from CNN Wires and CNN's Light Years blog was used in this report.","Scientists say they've found new evidence the Higgs boson exists .

"(CNN) -- Tech startups are notoriously known for being scrappy and bland when it comes to office decor. IKEA desks and chairs can be the height of style in these work spaces, and many don't build in a budget for much decor beyond that. Yet a new era is emerging that encourages a higher level of attention to design and do-it-yourself decor. The philosophy: Startup employees are working a minimum of 10 hours each day, so why shouldn't they enjoy their surroundings? Brit + Co.: 100 creative DIY wall art ideas to decorate your space . Sprucing up doesn't have to break the budget, either. With a few DIY tricks, you can transform any plain Jane space into something conversation-worthy. Being a startup founder myself, I've been lucky enough to get exposed to some of the most creative and tech-savvy spaces ever, many of which reflect the personalities and business models of the companies themselves. Take a peek at some of the creative decor ideas I've found. I hope they encourage you to spend some time to personalize your work space. Brit + Co.: Our 4 favorite things about Apple's new line of iPhones . Pinterest . Everett Katigbak joined Pinterest in 2013, after a stint at Facebook, bringing his passion for design in startups with him. Part of his role is focused on maintaining employee happiness, so he uses interior design as a way to build a fun and creative internal culture. Because employees don't have offices, but rather an open work space, he has incorporated a printing press and several letterpress signs into the design of the space. Even though it's a digital company, the act of physical creation expresses Pinterest's core philosophy. Brit + Co. Here at my own startup, we recently came up with a ""Pimp Your Desk"" competition and gave each employee a $50 budget to spend decorating their space. The winner? One of our mobile engineers! (This is extraordinary given the fact that we have so many creative people on the team who spend their days decorating and doing DIY projects.) Dzuy Linh, the engineer behind the blue ribbon, created a diner-themed desk. He used vinyl decals for a red and checkerboard base, then found 50s-themed objects to help accessorize. He even repurposed a straw dispenser into a pop-up pencil holder. Very clever. Brit + Co.: 40 genius no-sew DIY projects . The runner-up in our ""Pimp Your Desk"" competition was Misty Spinney, a production manager. A child of the '90s, she created her own DIY Nintendo desk. The planter is made from old games, the notepad holder is made from vintage Nintendo controllers, and she used an N64 controller as a display for her pens, scissors and iPhone chargers. How cool is that? LinkedIn . Though well-established LinkedIn is no longer a startup, Krista Canfield, a senior manager of corporate communications, has decorated her space in true startup style. The area includes ""In"" gear she has accumulated over the past five years with the company, a high-heel tape dispenser (she has a reputation for wearing fancy footwear), her team's favorite quotes, and, a life-sized photo of LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. A homemade version of Vincent Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" painting on the wall behind her desk was created collaboratively with her team. Each member painted a panel to make up the full-sized art piece. Brit + Co.: How to turn wine bottles into tumblers . Tech Cocktail . Tech Cocktail is a media company and events organization for startups, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts. The team recently opened up shop in downtown Las Vegas as part of the Downtown Project and worked with a local contractor to build out creative custom elements. For instance, the desks fold up for events and the legs are shaped like martini glasses to match their logo. They also have a ""creativity nook"" built into a closet where a large hanging roll of paper can be pulled across the table for sketching ideas. CEO Frank Gruber has a desk with a Murphy bed nearby (for late nights or guests), and a wall of ""eyeballs"" behind it, which visitors sign when they come through. Stitch Fix . Stitch Fix is an online styling service that lets you create a style profile and then sends you clothing every month that matches your tastes. You keep whatever you like and send the rest back. It's a lazy shopper's dream! Brit + Co.: Life lessons: How to waterproof your shoes . CEO Katrina Lake has one of the most well-designed offices I've ever seen. Her personal office is called the ""Classic"" room and is inspired by the Classic Chic fashion styles that she says many Stitch Fix customers favor. The team was able to bring this room to life for under $1,000. Starting with a DIY hand painted wall, the team then picked a selection of playful pieces to enhance the room's ambiance. From the chevron patterned chairs to the classic metal-framed pictures, they chose a range of items that embodies the Stitch Fix style. ""Soft and approachable, we wanted this space to be both comfortable and welcoming,"" Lake said. ""The logo wall is another DIY project created with a projector and painters tape."" Hotel Tonight . Hotel Tonight is one of my favorite travel secrets. The site (and app) sniff out incredible discounts on same-day hotel reservations. And it's not just 2-star hotels, either. Top hotels across the country use the platform. CEO Sam Shank keeps his work space fresh by using a custom-made desk that he designed to match the look of the company's favorite hotel partners. ""He also built a few miniature beds using LEGOs and a 3-D scanner in the h-shaped style of Hotel Tonight's logo, and tends to keep a bottle of bourbon around for celebratory drinks (or late nights). Brit + Co.: The 25 best couple costumes ever . Tonx . Though not a tech startup, Tonx is a coffee startup that uses technology to spread the message of how it sources beans from the best farmers across the world. You can use its site to set up a coffee subscription, ensuring you never wake up and go to work tired again. Nik Bauman, CEO of Tonx, was inspired by the healthy concept of a standing desk, and set out to create one of his own. The DIY desk he came up with cost less than $200 and took just a couple of hours to construct. He used the IKEA Lack TV unit ($50), IKEA Galant A-frame desk legs ($15 each) and a base frame ($30). He spent about $5 on bolts, washers and nuts to complete the task. Lover.ly . If you know anyone planning a wedding, point them in the direction of Lover.ly. It's a tech startup that helps brides-to-be easily find design inspiration and wedding-related products. Kellee Khalil, founder and CEO, decided to decorate their office walls in a pink splash that matches their logo. The team also created DIY paper art in heart shapes for wall decor. My favorite part: A hand-made paper calendar on the walls, despite the fact that the site lives and breathes by technology. What creative work spaces have you seen recently that you'd like to share?

"(CNN) -- Paula Newby-Fraser, widely known as ""the Queen of Kona,"" has won 21 Ironman Triathlon titles and eight Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii -- more than any other athlete, male or female, in the 36-year history of the event. Newby-Faser now serves as a coach, mentoring Super Bowl champion Hines Ward during his journey to Kona in 2013. She is working with Olympian Apolo Ohno for his trip to the 2014 Ironman World Championship. CNN asked her to offer some tips to the Fit Nation triathletes, who are tackling the Nautica Malibu Triathlon next week. CNN: What are your top tips for newbies? Paula Newby-Fraser: The first triathlon can be a pretty daunting task because there are three disciplines to master. Here's what I suggest: . Set up a training program that is grounded in the realities of your daily life. An overambitious plan can undermine mental and physical progress. Set up a plan that focuses on becoming efficient and comfortable at the distances that you want to cover in each discipline. Integrate a support network of family, training partners and tri clubs to keep your program on track. Don't overthink the equipment part too soon. Getting in consistent swim, bike and run workouts is more important than gadgets and technology. Being a competent swimmer is one of the most critical steps in building confidence, especially since it's the first leg of a triathlon. Swimming is the most ""challenging"" discipline to learn as a newbie and also very important from a safety perspective. When you do get into an event, always stay in the moment and do exactly what you have done in training. Nothing much different happens in a race than happens in all those workouts you have logged, except that you have a lot of like-minded people around to cheer you on. CNN: Explain the physical and mental training it takes to be a professional endurance athlete. Newby-Fraser: Being a professional athlete is much like being at the top of your game in anything. The commitment becomes part of the fabric of your identity. It is a fundamental aspect of daily life and how you interact with the world. Each and every day is an assessment of your body and the training that needs to be done and all that goes with it: recovery, diet, lifestyle choices, and symbiotically, your mind has to embrace and adapt to that. As with anything, there are great days that have filled me with such joy and confidence, and there are the days that are a brutal struggle. Being conscious of this ongoing engagement and partnership between mind and body is perhaps the greatest key to successful training as an endurance athlete. CNN: How do you know if you are ready to tackle your first triathlon? Newby-Fraser: From personal experience, I feel that the only way to find out is to get out there and do it! Even when armed with the mental knowledge and physical process of consistently executing a training program, only lining up and participating in an event will answer that question. So go do it! CNN: What was your first triathlon? Newby-Fraser: My first triathlon was an Olympic distance event held in South Africa. Even coming from a swimming background, it was still nerve-wracking to see the distance laid out before me in the lake. My greatest anxiety came from doing an event that was going to last over two hours. Despite all the years of being an athlete growing up, I was nervous about putting it all together for the first time. The event was successful despite ""blowing up"" on the run. The emotion and excitement of the start gun had me going out way too hard, and my legs were dead by the time I got to the run. It was a tough but rewarding experience to cross the finish line after how my legs felt when I got off the bike. I could not believe how tired they were and wondered how I was ever going to be able to ""run"" six miles. Overcoming this mental hurdle marked the start of a great journey athletically and personally. CNN: How have your feelings about competing changed through the years? Does the ""Queen of Kona"" get race-day jitters? Newby-Fraser: Years of experience have taught me how to keep perspective about competing. I fully understand that doing events is a celebration of hard work. Knowing that not every day can be my best has made my experience less emotional. There are still a few butterflies at the start of an event, because who doesn't want to have a ""good"" day versus a struggle? I still get moments of anxiousness about not wanting to struggle through. Then I remind myself that even if I do, I know how to handle it.","Paula Newby-Fraser has won 21 Ironman Triathlon titles, 8 world championships .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain's campaign has told Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty he will not be the GOP vice presidential nominee in November, sources told CNN on Friday. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty suggested in a radio interview that he won't be Sen. John McCain's VP pick. Pawlenty on Friday also told WCCO Radio in Minneapolis-St. Paul that he will not be in Dayton, Ohio, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to unveil his choice of a running mate at a rally later Friday. The McCain campaign said it's hoping to have 15,000 people at the Ohio event, roughly five times the size of his largest crowd to date. A Republican source said McCain settled on his choice of a running mate at a meeting of his advisers Wednesday. Thursday night's arrival of a private jet from Alaska at the Middleton, Ohio, airport raised speculation that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin would be McCain's pick. Middleton is 25 miles from Dayton. Rich Bevis, an airport manager at the Middleton airport, said that a woman, two men and two teenagers were onboard.  Watch conservative analyst Bill Bennett mull Palin as a VP pick » . ""This is the most secretive flight we've ever had,"" Bevis said. In June, Palin told CNN that she thought McCain should choose a governor as his running mate and that she would like to serve on a national level, ""but I don't think it's going to happen on this go-round though.""   Watch Palin say she won't be VP this time » . In an interview with a Pennsylvania radio station that was taped Wednesday and aired Thursday, McCain said he had not settled on a nominee. The Associated Press reported that the interview with KDKA radio had occurred Thursday, which created confusion as to whether McCain had finalized his choice for vice president.  Watch who is on McCain's shortlist » . Asked whether either former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge or former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was his VP pick, McCain replied to KDKA, ""I haven't decided yet, so I can't tell you."" Both men are expected to join McCain at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania. Ridge, who is also the former secretary of homeland security, is reportedly on McCain's shortlist of possible running mates. A Republican insider said this month that McCain campaign manager Rick Davis has called several state party chairmen and indicated that Ridge will be the Republican vice presidential pick this cycle. During his interview with KDKA, McCain praised Ridge, saying, ""He's a great American and a great and dear friend, and I rely on him, and I have for many years."" But the possibility that Ridge could be McCain's running mate sparked a backlash among conservatives because he supports abortion rights. Another potential VP pick, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, also raised concerns among conservatives. Lieberman, an independent senator who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee, has been a vocal supporter of the war in Iraq, but he, too, backs abortion rights. If McCain picks either man, it could drive away social conservatives who are already uneasy about his nomination, conservative activists warned. In an open letter to McCain, conservative activist Richard A. Viguerie wrote, ""Your indication that you're willing to put a person who has a clear, unequivocal pro-abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming."" ""Sen. McCain, you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick -- you wear it as a badge of honor. Well, poke the base of the Republican Party -- the conservatives -- in the eye one more time by choosing a pro-abortion vice presidential candidate, and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game,"" Viguerie said. Romney ran against McCain this year for the GOP presidential nomination and was a frequent critic of the senator on the campaign trail. But Romney endorsed McCain after he captured the Republican nomination and has campaigned for him. He also opposes abortion rights, a position he said he came to in 2004 after studying the stem cell-issue as Massachusetts governor. Before then, Romney was in favor of abortion rights. CNN's Evan Glass, Alexander Mooney, Dana Bash and John King contributed to this report.","Sources: Sen. John McCain not selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty .

"(CNN) -- Shhh. They can hear you. They're listening as we speak -- logging every word, tracing every step. Even tonight, while you sleep under your hotel-monogrammed duvet, rest assured that 20 stories below, in some undisclosed location, researchers are hard at work documenting your whims and wishes -- Loves biking! Hates bananas! -- trying to crack the profound mystery that is You. How much do they know? They want to know everything: your relationship status, your income, your allergies, your preferred brand of toothpaste, how you like your eggs -- all those sundry habits, peeves and predilections, even the ones you didn't know you had. Hotels have always kept logs on their guests, tracking previous stays, comments and complaints, even which pay-per-view movies you ordered. ""We write down everything,"" says Karambir Singh Kang, area director, USA, for Taj Hotels and general manager of the Taj Boston. So when the bellman casually inquires, ""Where are we off to today, folks?"" no doubt your reply will be fed into your ever-expanding profile. Sometimes this ""research"" can take on questionable ethical dimensions. One veteran general manager told me his staff aren't above going through guests' trash. Travel + Leisure: World's best hotels . But fishing around is not a recent development. What has changed, in this brazen new world, is the sheer amount of data that hotels now collect on guests, and the often startlingly personal nature of that data. With the explosion of social networking, and our increasingly unguarded presence online, profiling guests has become a lot easier, and a hell of a lot more effective. A representative for a prestigious Beverly Hills hotel recalls welcoming a first-time guest to the property. ""We knew very little about her before she checked in, so we searched for her online and discovered she had a dog named Bo,"" the rep says. ""When she arrived, there was a little doggy gift waiting in her room, with a note card that said 'Bo misses you.' "" Creepy? Cute? You be the judge. Prying is the new pampering. The payoff, hospitality executives say, is the ability to tailor service to a guest without the guest's initiating any requests herself. Under the old model, a guest would have to volunteer that she loves tennis and might enjoy a lesson. Now, ideally, she need no longer say a thing; the staff has already sussed her out and booked a 9 o'clock with the pro. Travel + Leisure: Where to rent celebrity homes . As for that quaint ""pre-arrival questionnaire"" they used to send to incoming guests? Nearly obsolete, except at the most traditional properties. Who has the time to fill one out? Besides, for many of us, our identities, preferences and proclivities are already posted online, and ripe for the culling. For hotel companies, social media has essentially become a sanctioned form of eavesdropping. ""Hotels have trained their staff to be intense listeners and mine information about their guests. This gives them a whole new realm in which to listen,"" says Niki Leondakis, CEO of Commune Hotels & Resorts (formerly the president and COO of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants). And listen they do. At One&Only Resorts, reservation teams look up incoming guests on Twitter, work-related sites and blogs, then draw up detailed profiles (photos included) to distribute to top-level managers. The St. Regis Bora Bora Resort, meanwhile, Googles every guest two weeks before arrival. ""We actually create a little story about them -- just a paragraph or so -- and share that with the heads of each department at our daily NDA (next-day arrivals) meeting,"" says general manager Michael Schoonewagen. (You didn't know they had a little story about you, did you?) It's not rocket science, Schoonewagen adds, and it doesn't cost them a thing. ""The first page of Google results is usually sufficient. We're not digging into every last detail of someone's life -- we just want a picture of who they are."" World's strangest buildings . Other hotels invest more money and manpower in tracking guests online. The Surrey Hotel in New York was an early adopter of the powerful Libra OnDemand software, which aids in ""customer relationship management,"" or CRM. ""Libra acts as a one-stop shop for searching guests on Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and other channels,"" explains JosÃ© Lema, the Surrey's director of guest relations. ""It gives us the power to get to know our guests, beyond what they'd think to share with us."" As Lema sees it, guests are looking not only for great amenities but also for ""connection"" -- with a staff that can intuit their tastes and desires, including unspoken ones. ""Previously, we did all our profiling via manual online searches, and only VIPs and guests paying a certain rate were researched,"" Lema says. ""Now every reservation is processed by Libra."" In today's social-mediated paradigm, wherein everyone lives in public, all guests can be treated like celebrities. This proves especially useful in orchestrating what hotels call ""surprise-and-delight moments."" So if you happen to tweet ""Just arrived @FSLosAngeles for anniversary weekend!"" don't be shocked if a bottle of wine appears at turn-down. (Be surprised and delighted, but don't be shocked.) ""A guest's Twitter feed can provide information that they aren't even telling you -- and then you can really surprise them,"" notes Leondakis. ""For instance, maybe the hotel will find out the guest is an advocate for LGBT rights, in which case the staff can personalize the welcome amenity by including a magazine they would identify with. Something unique and personal that says, 'This is just for you.'"" Cranks and paranoiacs will surely see all this probing and profiling as a sign of the apocalypse, or at least a serious incursion into their privacy. (It's worth noting that, because of privacy regulations in the EU, companies are less likely to gather personal information online, so these practices are more common at U.S.-based and independent hotels.) Some may pine for the days when travel could be refreshingly anonymous, when hotels were at least purportedly about discretion above all else. But would we really want to go back? The fact is, profiling works -- most of the time. Who wouldn't want their hotel to know, without even asking, what type of pillow to leave on the bed, which magazines to leave on the coffee table, what brand of juice to put in the mini-bar? Who doesn't enjoy being surprised and delighted? And just so we're clear, we're talking about hotels here. Hotels -- where, discreet as one might hope to be, it's impossible not to leave an identifiable footprint. Long before Twitter this was so. You might hang that flimsy privacy sign on your door, but you can't hide. You can't ""turn off cookies."" The staff's eyes and ears are everywhere. (For God's sake, they're going through your trash!) Trust me, they know plenty about you already, and they didn't need a search engine to find it. The key, as one hotel manager puts it, is ""to act on that knowledge without calling undue attention to it."" If your profile says you requested the Wall Street Journal on a previous visit, a skilled desk clerk will simply have it delivered again this time, without comment. Nobody wants to hear the words ""And we see from our deep background check that Sir enjoys the Journal""! No, we prefer to think this stuff happens by magic, not by design; that the staff are just incredibly good at their jobs, not following a computer-generated set of directives -- which, frankly, seems like cheating. Bear with me as we compare your hotel to Santa Claus. One would like to believe that Santa knows what you want -- and whether you've earned it -- based on his compassion, care and superior powers of intuition. What you don't want to discover is that Santa's elves have been monitoring your Google, Bing and Amazon searches for gift ideas, then poring over your Facebook wall to see if you've been good enough to deserve them. Of course, there's a delicate line between intuitiveness and intrusiveness, between ""personalization"" and, well, stalking. Consider this curious tale from New York restaurateur Danny Meyer, who literally wrote the book on hospitality. (It's called ""Setting the Table,"" and it's required reading for anyone in the industry.) Last June -- on Father's Day -- Meyer returned to his room at the Little Nell in Aspen, Colorado, to find a framed photo of his wife and children beside the bed. ""On the frame it said 'Happy Father's Day from your friends at the Little Nell,'"" he recalls. ""They'd gone online to find a picture of us."" To me that sounds neither surprising nor delightful, but downright terrifying. I'm trying to picture my own reaction: You hunted down my FAMILY?!? Leave them out of this, you monsters!! But Meyer, to his credit, found it touching. ""I almost started crying,"" he says. ""That photo is now on my dresser at home. I thought it was a genuinely thoughtful gesture. Look, anyone can give you a plate of cookies, and sure, that feels nice. But this wasn't off-the-rack. It was about customization -- one-size-fits-one. That's true hospitality.""

"(CNN) -- I get it. I get all the Pinterest jokes. I totally agree it is causing many of us already stressed-out moms to feel like we are in constant competition to throw the perfect birthday party, make the perfect school snack and take the perfect family photo. And yet, I will totally own the fact that I am a Pinterest mom. I'm that lady. I threw my daughter, Elyse, a superhero party for her 6th birthday and made everything by hand. I create whimsical Halloween costumes. I make occasion-appropriate snacks. I do not do this to bolster my flagging ego or to one-up my fellow moms. I do this because, as a special-needs mom, there are a lot of ""mom"" things I am NOT. My second daughter, Anabelle, was born with the neurological disorders lissencephaly and microcephaly. Lissencephaly means ""smooth brain"" and microcephaly means ""small head."" What this means is that while she was in utero, her brain stopped developing, due to a random miswriting of her genetic code. Now almost 4, she is cognitively still a newborn. She cannot hold up her own head, she eats through a gastronomy tube in her stomach, she requires oxygen support when she sleeps and she cannot control her own body temperature. She has quadripalegic cerebral palsy, is legally blind and has severe epilepsy. It is unsafe to have her outside in all but the most optimum weather conditions, and it's risky to bring her around crowds of people and all their germs. Because of this, my older daughter, 6-year-old Elyse, spends a lot more time at home than many of her peers. There are a lot of things Elyse doesn't get to do. I am not a ""Let's join the traveling soccer team and spend hours every week on the road"" mom. I'm not a ""Do every activity you want as long as you get your schoolwork done"" mom. I am not a ""playdates every weekend"" mom, a ""spectator at every event"" mom or a ""spontaneous family trip"" mom."" (Hell, I'm not even a ""well-planned vacation"" mom.) Depending on Anabelle's health, I'm not even a ""tuck you into bed every night"" mom. I have forgotten to send my daughter to school in a jersey on sports day, I have missed sign-ups for things, and I have said no to classes Elyse wants to take because I cannot possibly get her there every week. When Anabelle was 6 months old and Elyse was 3, a friend sent me an ""invitation"" to join Pinterest. It was like opening the golden gates to never-ending possibilities for the trapped-at-home mom I so often was! While I have always considered myself passably crafty, what I am not is wildly creative. And there it was: The ultimate guide to the perfect childhood! OK, I admit that's overstating it a little bit, but I was a desperate, terrified, newly inducted special-needs mom with a bored, over-active toddler on my hands. Armed with endless ideas and step-by-step instructions, I could create wonderful memories with Elyse despite rarely leaving home. The thing many people don't realize about being the parent of a special-needs child is that, for those of us who also have kids without disabilities, it is usually their well-being and future that cause us the greatest heartache. Anabelle has never wanted for a thing in her short life. It is Elyse who never has two parents at her side on outings, or may never get that trip to Disney World she so desperately wants. Elyse knows that only one parent will be there for her school events. We are the family with only one parent in the stands at sporting events and one parent in the audience for dance recitals. In Anabelle's case, she is so susceptible to getting ill that it just isn't safe for her to be in a crowd. Elyse's father and sister were not at her last birthday party because it was outside in the July heat, which Anabelle cannot manage. Elyse does have to pay the price for having a special-needs sibling. My typical child breaks my heart much more frequently than my special-needs child. The needs of my second child restrict the movement most parents of young children are used to in their lifestyle, and that affects both my children. It is for Elyse that I have to get creative in the ways I create memories. It can be really hard not having the time to be the mom I would like to be. But the one thing I DO do? I spend a lot of time at home. Anabelle's fragile health means she lives in a virtual bubble a lot of the time. I might not be able to run Elyse around doing fun activities and having experiences outside the home, but I can create fun and memories inside the home. Elyse helps me with most of my Pinterest-inspired activities. It allows us to bond and express our creative energy. It allows me to contribute something meaningful to her childhood beyond hospitals and therapists and holding the suction wand for her sister. So please, don't take it as a challenge when my daughter and I make her teacher's end-of-the-year gift. I'm just using what I have so my daughter has one thing about which she can say, ""Hey, MY mom does that!"" Do you use Pinterest as a parenting tool?

"(CNN) -- The king of Jordan dismissed his government Tuesday and appointed a new prime minister with orders to implement political reform. The dismissal follows several protests calling for change in Jordan -- protests that echo demonstrations that have swept across North Africa and the Middle East in the last few weeks. King Abdullah II asked Marouf Al Bakhit to form a government in Jordan that will implement ""genuine political reform,"" the Royal Court said in a statement. The government will ""take practical steps, quick and concrete, to launch a process of genuine political reform"" and ""comprehensive development,"" according to a letter from the king to Al Bakhit. It also will act to strengthen democracy, the letter said. Jordan has been deprived of ""achievement opportunities"" due to some leaders' resistance to change, the king wrote, and because they had sometimes put their own interests ahead of those of the public. The king asked Al Bakhit and the new government ""to conduct a thorough evaluation process"" and review laws regarding political affairs and civil freedoms to ""address the mistakes of the past"" and develop ""a clear action plan that takes the march of reform forward."" King Abdullah II also called on the new government to strengthen the institutional infrastructure and combat corruption, and prosecute those found to be involved in corruption. Jawad Anani, a former Jordanian deputy prime minister, told CNN the changes had to be made and that the development comes amid a ""deep outcry in the Arab world"" seeking change and reform. He said the king wants Jordan to be more competitive, globalized, and influential, but the management he's been choosing ""has not been very successful."" ""That's why there's been many changes in government,"" Anani said. In this case, the message of reform, he said, covers the political, social, economic, and educational arenas. ""This is a very tall order at this time,"" Anani said. But, he said, the king has ""kick-started a process"" for all Jordanian citizens ""to join in and make their opinions heard."" The development in Jordan follows protests that forced the president of Tunisia from power and unrest that has convulsed Egypt for days. Demonstrators also have called for change in Algeria, Sudan and Yemen. Protest organizers have called for a demonstration this week in Syria. In Jordan, police estimated that several thousand people gathered in the capital Friday to demand more significant economic and political reforms. Protesters including Islamists, leftists and union members marched in downtown Amman, and there were protests in six other cities as well, authorities said. It was the third Friday in a row for the protests. Demonstrators gathered in front of the Al Husseini Mosque to decry government policies they blamed for rising prices, low wages and unemployment. The demonstrators had demanded what the king did Tuesday -- sack Prime Minister Samir Rifai, who took office in December 2009. They also called for the dissolution of parliament. The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, is also asking for an ""elected government."" Currently, the king appoints the prime minister and the Cabinet. The Jordanian government in recent weeks announced several measures aimed at easing citizens' economic hardships, including reducing taxes on fuel derivatives and subsidizing some basic commodities. A pay raise of 20 Jordanian dinars a month (US$28) was given to civil servants, military personnel and retirees. But protesters Friday said the measures do not go far enough. Those in Amman Friday also showed their solidarity with others in the Arab world, most notably Egypt, where protesters have recently taken to the streets to demand certain freedoms and urge the ouster of their leaders and the government. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Journalist Amy Hybels contributed to this report.","The new government is directed to launch the political reform process .

"(CNN) -- What turns a few cases of disease into thousands? Sometimes Ebola, or cholera or other infectious diseases, emerge and are brought under control, but the current Ebola crisis in West Africa continues to grow. What makes the critical difference in quickly controlling an outbreak? Luck plays a part. Where the first cases emerge, what the weather is like, the coincidence of holidays and migration can all make a difference in how quickly disease spreads. Biology also matters, including the unexpected evolution of pathogens and the level of prior exposure and immunity in populations at risk. Health infrastructure is important too. Countries that invest little in health -- including training health personnel and public health surveillance and diagnostic capacity -- will struggle to mount a rapid and effective response. Bad luck and lack of investment in health are hard to address once a disease starts to spread. However, a lot depends on how governments respond to the first cases that pop up -- and denying or minimizing the early cases is one of the worst things a government can do. Indeed, restricting health information and imposing controls on the media breed mistrust and impede an effective response. Another potential obstacle, which might seem counterintuitive, is quarantines. Ebola cases first appeared in West Africa five months ago, and so far, there have been more than 4,784 confirmed or suspected cases, and more than 2,400 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. As cases first emerged, the lack of information about the disease and suspicion of the government led to rumors that the reports of Ebola were created by the government to secure -- and embezzle -- aid. Although Ebola is not transmitted by water, fears spread in Liberia that the government was poisoning wells to increase the number of cases. In Guinea, on August 29, people rioted when a market was sprayed with disinfectant they believed was infected with the Ebola virus, with more than 50 injured. People attacked health workers and the hospital in Guinea's second largest city, Nzerekore, shouting: ""Ebola is a lie!"" Then quarantines were imposed. Following an attack on an Ebola treatment center in West Point, a populous neighborhood in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, the government reportedly ordered a quarantine of the entire peninsula. The incidence of Ebola was reportedly no higher in West Point than anywhere else in the city, but Information Minister Lewis Brown said the neighborhood was quarantined because of its density and the potential for political violence. The quarantine was abandoned after 10 days, but Brown declared it a success because it changed attitudes -- increasing awareness of the severity of the disease. Isolating a community as punishment for not trusting the government neither fosters trust nor effectively limits transmission. During the quarantine period, the price of basic goods like food, water, coal, soap and phone cards doubled. The cost of rice tripled, to 90 cents a cup. Early on, there were violent clashes between security forces and angry residents trying to leave. A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot, and four other residents were wounded. In addition, residents who could afford it bribed security forces to get out, while others fled by swimming away or escaped when security was lax. Access to routine health care inside the quarantine zone was limited and there were reports of pregnant women desperate for help. Meanwhile, on September 6 in Sierra Leone, government officials announced a three-day quarantine to facilitate detecting cases through house-to-house searches. Yet detecting Ebola cases is not necessarily straightforward, and Sierra Leone doesn't have sufficient capacity to hospitalize everyone it may identify. Doctors Without Borders issued a statement that ""lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers. This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further."" So what can be done? Education and social mobilization campaigns that explain Ebola and facilitate community participation in the response are key. Social support and home-based care can increase trust and ensure that voluntary isolation measures are respected and people who are sick can be safely cared for at home. Efforts to ensure that survivors are not shunned and stigmatized are also important, and survivors, who are immune from reinfection, can play an important role in the response. In other words: Ensure that the Ebola response respects human rights. Access to health information and treatment, involving the community in the planning and response to the epidemic, making sure that restrictions on liberty and movement are imposed only when they are strictly necessary -- these are all human rights principles that are codified in international treaties. Of course, respecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights is not a magic bullet to stop a disease in its tracks. But, as we've seen in the current Ebola outbreak, failing to implement a response in line with human rights principles can increase the risk that a small outbreak will become a much larger one.","Outbreak of Ebola has claimed more than 2,200 lives, according to WHO .

"(CNN) -- The vast Tsukiji Market in Tokyo is where the country's finest delicacies are sold and auctioned, not only fish -- for which the market is famous -- but also fruit and vegetable. Earlier this month, UNESCO, the U.N. cultural organization, added traditional Japanese cuisine, or ""washoku,"" into its Intangible Cultural Heritage list. ""'Wa' means Japanese, 'shoku' means 'to eat' or 'meal' or anything food-related,"" explains cooking instructor and ""washoku"" enthusiast Reiko Yoshikawa. For Japanese, food is associated with many things. ""First of all, it means happiness, the gathering, of being together,"" Yoshikawa says. ""Nutrition, in a sense, is also very important and also the appreciation to nature."" Yoshikawa guided CNN through the legendary marketplace, which is set to be relocated in 2016. Like many shoppers, she is particular where she gets her supply. A fish stall called Di Nobu, for example, is where she sources her tuna. Food is taken seriously in Japan, and it's not only seafood, for which the country is famous. Melons are highly prized, and those grown in Japanese greenhouses are considered the perfect fruit and can command high prices. During an auction a box of six melons fetches around $250 -- ""the highest price today,"" Yoshikawa says. See more: An insider guide to Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market . ""Washoku"" is the 22nd Japanese cultural asset to be listed on UNESCO's heritage list, which also includes the country's theater forms such as Kabuki, Noh and Bunraku. The U.N. recognition is another sign of how Japanese food has begun to earn global accolades. (In 2010, French gastronomy was included into the UNESCO list.) In the past half-decade, Japan has quickly emerged as a major force in fine dining. It has 27 three-starred restaurants in the 2014 Michelin guide. The figure is matched only by France, a country long regarded as home to the world's finest restaurants, chefs and cuisine. But in contrast to the rarefied world of fine dining and superstar chefs, ""washoku,"" the world-recognized national treasure, is not anything fancy. ""It's comfort food,"" Yoshikawa says. ""It's not something that you eat out in restaurants. The image, the impression of Japanese food outside of Japan is probably something that you would eat out at a restaurant. But, no, it's actually very simple, very seasonal."" Yenni Kwok contributed to this report . CNN's On the Road series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile.

"(CNN) -- William ""Kyle"" Carpenter lost most of his jaw and an eye when he fell on a grenade to shield a fellow Marine from the blast. His body shattered, one lung collapsed, the Marine lance corporal was nearly given up for dead after that 2010 Afghanistan firefight. Then he spent 2Â½ years in a hospital as doctors worked to rebuild his body. But if you think he's bitter, think again. ""I look back and I'm actually very appreciative I had those two and a half years, because those years put things in perspective more than a whole lifetime of things could if I wasn't there,"" Carpenter said, according to the Marine Corps. On Monday, the White House announced he would become the eighth living veteran of U.S. combat in Iraq and Afghanistan to receive the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award. He'll receive the medal on June 19, the White House said. Carpenter was wounded in Helmand province, Afghanistan, on November 21, 2010, while serving as a machine gunner, according to the White House. Carpenter and another Marine were manning a rooftop position during a firefight with Taliban insurgents when a hand grenade landed nearby, the Marine Corps said. According to the Marine Corps, Carpenter rushed toward the grenade and his body took most of the blast. The other Marine, Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, also was injured. In a Defense Department video, Carpenter said he had to be revived while being evacuated by helicopter from the battle and was labeled dead on arrival at a field hospital. He later nearly died again at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, he said. ""The enemy killed me. I came back, ran a marathon, completed a mud run and jumped from a plane. I won't ever quit. I am just getting started,"" he said in the video. Carpenter, medically retired from the Marine Corps last year as a corporal, is now a student at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, the White House said.

"(CNN) -- FIFA has suspended Nigeria from international football citing government interference in the running of its national federation. The emergency committee of the world governing body said the blanket ban would come into to place with ""immediate effect"" which means no Nigerian team, including club sides, can play in regional, continental or international competitions. In the wake of Nigeria's exit to France at the last 16 of the World Cup, the high court of the West African country ruled that its federation would cease to run the national team, handing over the role to a government civil servant. This is in breach of a FIFA rules that obliges member associations to manage their own affairs ""independently and with no influence from third parties,"" it said in a statement. Stephen Keshi, the coach of the African champions, resigned the day after the 2-0 defeat, after leading the Super Eagles out of the group stages of the World Cup for the first time since 1998. FIFA warned the Nigerian authorities it would take action, but at the weekend an extraordinary general meeting of the federation took place in Abuja without former NFF (Nigerian Football Federation) chief Aminu Maigari and his congress having been restored to their positions. Maigari was also arrested on his return from South America, but was later released. ""The suspension will be lifted once the court actions have been withdrawn and the properly elected NFF Executive Committee, the NFF general assembly and the NFF administration are able to work without any interference in their affairs,"" FIFA added. Read: Third African title for Super Eagles . The first team to suffer from the ban will be the Nigerian team which is due to take part in FIFA under-20 Women's World Cup next month. Nigeria's men's national team is also scheduled to begins its defense of the African Cup of Nations title when qualifying matches start in September. In addition to the exclusion from competitions, the NFF will also fall outside of any training or development programs run by FIFA. It is not the first time it has fallen foul of the strict FIFA rules on government interference. Nigeria was temporarily banned from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after interventions by the country's president Goodluck Jonathan. Fellow African World Cup qualifier Cameroon was also hit by a temporary suspension in July 2013 for falling foul of the same rule.","Nigeria banned from international football competitions .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- It's 10:45 a.m. on a cloudy day, and the crew of Druk Air flight KB205 is preparing to land at their home airport of Paro, Bhutan. Suddenly, ominous warnings start blaring, alerting them that their flight angle is all wrong and their rate of descent is far too fast. They fly a series of unconventional right-and-left banks through a narrow channel of hillsides before centering the swaying jet and putting it on the tarmac. An excess of government buildings and restricted airspace make it challenging to land at Washington's Reagan National Airport. An emergency situation? Not quite. In fact, this is a completely normal -- however nail-biting -- landing at Paro Airport, set 7,300 feet above sea level. Because of the airport's tightly cropped valley, surrounded by 16,000-foot-high serrated Himalayan peaks, this drama replays itself on every flight. There's a sobering saying among pilots: ""Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing."" And it's not until you fly into places like Paro, or Toncontìn Airport in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, that the adage starts to make sense. Both are surrounded by mountains, and Toncontìn has one of the world's shortest international runways; each requires a series of hard last-minute banks. It's no wonder both give even the most seasoned pilots -- not to mention their passengers -- the sweats. While Bhutan is the most extreme example -- only eight pilots in the world are qualified to fly into Paro -- a number of the world's airports, from St. Maarten in the Caribbean to Madeira Airport in Funchal, can present challenges for pilots. ""A lot of these airports require additional training and route familiarization because they're so crazy,"" says one commercial pilot who flies international routes. Slideshow: Travel + Leisure's list of the scariest runways . According to aviation experts, mitigating factors range from the truncated length of runways to unique atmospheric and meteorological conditions, dramatic geographical settings, heavy air traffic, or a combination thereof. ""Sometimes it's just the way the airport is laid out that makes it a pain,"" says the pilot, referring to whether an airport is situated askew. One such tricky spot: Reagan National Airport, in Washington, D.C. That's not because of strange Potomac River winds or the pressure of being watched by statues of past presidents. It's the excess of government buildings and restricted airspace that makes setting down here like threading a needle with a 200-ton hunk of metal. In fact, cities are often tough: for years (73, to be exact), the honor of the world's most harrowing airport was reserved for Hong Kong's Kai Tak, whose single runway was jammed in between Victoria Harbor and densely populated Kowloon. Pilots had to battle crosswinds and fly a complicated curved approach, all while dodging mountains and high-rises. Kai Tak was shuttered in 1998 and replaced by a modern mega-port located on a reclaimed island out in the South China Sea. But many locales don't have that luxury, and continue to operate with their existing facilities, many of which include palm sweat-inducing approaches and photo-worthy opportunities. Travel + Leisure.com: Scariest runways . And it's not always the landing that's the stuff of lore. Matekane Air Strip, in the tiny African kingdom of Lesotho, features a stunted 1,312-foot-long runway perched at the edge of a couloir that sits at 7,550 feet. According to celebrated bush pilot Tom Claytor, depending on the wind during takeoff, it's entirely possible for the aircraft not to be airborne by the end of the airstrip. ""Instead,"" he says, ""you shoot off the end of the airstrip, then drop down the 2,000-foot cliff face until you start flying."" It's enough to make you take the train.

"(Wired) -- Photographer Christoph Morlinghaus takes us on a grand tour of the very best Modernist religious architecture in Form/Faith. From Eliel and Eero Saarinen's Midwest churches to Marcel Breuer's austere concrete to the far-out experiments of Pietro Belluschi, the series is a beautiful study of how religion has long spawned many of the world's most beautiful buildings. ""I was always in awe of how light and a few building materials like concrete, glass and wood can evoke a spiritual feeling,"" says Morlinghaus, who was drawn to the beauty of churches after experiencing the ""very cathedral-like feel"" of Eero Saarinen's Terminal 5 at JFK. The structures he documented are full of vaulted ceilings, soaring cantilevers and manipulated light, all of which are meant to enrapture believers. But Morlinghaus, who describes himself as agnostic, says he's not trying to sell anyone on the merits of religion. He simply wants to provide reverent and referential descriptions of the buildings. ""I try to keep my photography as distinct as I can from personal interpretations,"" says the photographer, whose exposures can be as long as 45 minutes in some of the darkened cathedrals. In all, Morlinghaus photographed 17 places of worship with his Sinar P2 8Ã—10 large format film camera. All but Mariendom in Neviges, Germany, are in the United States. In every case, Morlinghaus says, clergy and custodians were proud to welcome him in. ""These ecclesiastical buildings were the most accessible interiors that I ever photographed,"" he says. ""Rarely, have I encountered more cooperative or welcoming people."" While photographing at the US Air Force Academy Cadet Chapelâ€”a bustling tourist spotâ€”the minister barred anyone from entering during Morlinghaus' eight-minute exposure. Of all of the houses of worship he visited, Morlinghaus' favorite is the Thorncrown Chapel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, designed by E. Fay Jones. It's a monumental space that brings the forest into the church. Initially, Morlinghaus was dissatisfied with his first photograph, but second and third attempts achieved an image that reflected the soul-stirring flood of light within. Morlinghaus' image of Thorncrown (slide 10) is publicly shown here for the first time. Form/Faith is not yet finished. Like the buildings he photographs, Morlinghaus wants the project to be grand. Plus, there's much more religious architecture to be explored. ""It's time to continue and get the funding together,"" he says. More from Wired: . How to fix your iPhone's annoying autocorrect .

"(CNN) -- A question. What connects Facebook enthusiasts in China busy translating the social networking site into Mandarin and a community of orthopaedic surgeons swapping ideas on how to treat spinal injuries? Facebook has called on its network of users to create new innovations to the site. The answer. They're both examples of a worldwide phenomenon that is changing the way people -- and ultimately businesses -- develop ideas. Collaborative Innovation Networks (COINs) are online communities of like-minded people working together to create innovations. Author and scientist Peter Gloor originated the term. He describes it as a ""cyberteam of self-motivated people with a collective vision."" These cyberteams are cropping up everywhere, unified not only by their ""collective vision"" but by the giant tentacles of the Internet. In the case of Facebook, they are the Chinese users of the site who are helping to translate it into their native language. Elsewhere, they are the surgeons collaborating on SpineConnect, an online community where experts from around the world can exchange ideas for innovations in the treatment of spinal injuries. The potential of all this pooling of ideas is enormous, says Gloor. If you're not convinced, he says, take a look at what COINs have already accomplished -- the creation of the World Wide Web itself is the most obvious example. ""It was developed by a network of people based all over the world working as a COIN,"" says Gloor, who ought to know since he was there for part of its inception. Gloor was as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston 15 years ago at the same time as British scientist Tim Berners-Lee -- the man credited with inventing the Web. Berners-Lee had come over to the U.S. from CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland where the Web had first launched three years earlier. ""I had the benefit of watching him work close up for a few months, and I saw that his real genius lay in his ability to co-ordinate and incorporate the ideas of all these hundreds of other people based around the world."" Since then COINs have helped create much of our online landscape. The Web-based encyclopaedia Wikipedia and the Internet browser Mozilla Firefox are just two of the products whose development relies upon the contribution of a community of online users. Gloor says: ""I have a saying: 'Don't be a star, be a galaxy.' If you embed yourself in a galaxy you can go so much further."" ButGloor, who is from Switzerland, is not simply a delighted observer of the phenomenon. He was part of the network that helped develop hypertext -- online text that links to other text, like this. He worked with a hardcore of around 100 people worldwide, most of whom he never met and who worked on the project in their own time, and for little or no reward. ""Most of the innovation that you see on the Internet today was given away for nothing,"" he says. ""People did it for the sheer love of it."" This fraternal, almost unworldly attitude is a common feature of many COINs. For the network to be successful, contributors have to operate transparently and be willing to share their knowledge. This philanthropic, non-hierarchical approach to innovation sounds radical in an era when the theft of ideas by unscrupulous corporations is well documented. However, Gloor says the concept has a strong historical precedent in the 'Junto' organization set up in Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century. One of the Founding Fathers and a scientist by profession, Franklin set up the club for mutual improvement to allow people from diverse backgrounds to share knowledge and propose ideas. Of course the idea of working collaboratively to create innovations is not new. Taking just one example, the development of much of modern physics (from quantum theory to the creation of the atom bomb) owes its success to teamwork. The Manhattan Project, for example, employed more than 130,000 people at over thirty different sites across North America and Europe. Even so, it is an approach that the business world has found hard to come to terms with. Gloor says the rigid structure of many big corporations makes this free exchange of ideas difficult to achieve. ""In order to gain control, one has to give up control. But the one thing managers don't like doing is giving up control."" A case in point is the failure of Xerox to take advantage of the myriad of innovations produced at the company's research facility in the 1970s and early 1980s. The R&D centre known as Xerox PARC and located in Palo Alto, California, was responsible for inventing laser printing and the Ethernet, and for pioneering the use of the computer mouse. Xerox executives failed to grasp the potential of many of PARC's inventions and it was left to other firms to develop them fully, and enjoy the profits. Not all firms have been quite so sluggish. Procter and Gamble, the world's biggest maker of household goods, made a commitment in 2001 to source half of all new innovations from outside of the company. It set up 'Connect + Develop', an initiative that allows people to submit new innovations online. The venture has been so successful that P&G now gets 42 percent of all its new technologies from outside sources. As a medium for exchanging ideas, the Internet seems almost without peer. Chris Seth, managing director of the social networking site Piczo, says the collaborative potential of the Web has yet to be fully realized, however. ""If Web 2.0 was about sharing collective knowledge or publication, then collective action -- making decisions en masse -- will typify Web 3.0,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Sweden's culture minister was feeling the heat Wednesday after a weekend art exhibit in which she cut up a cake baked into the shape of a cartoonishly stereotyped African woman. A group representing Swedes of African descent has called for Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth to resign over that it called a racist caricature. But Liljeroth defended her participation, saying the cake was designed to ""challenge the traditional image of racism."" ""While the symbolism in the piece is despicable, it is unfortunate and highly regrettable that the presentation has been interpreted as an expression of racism by some,"" Liljeroth said in a statement issued by her office. ""The artistic intent was the exact opposite."" The artist who designed the cake, Makode Linde, is of African descent himself and said the piece was aimed at condemning the practice of female genital mutilation. Pictures from the Sunday exhibition showed Liljeroth slicing into the cake from the ""genitals"" and feeding it to Linde, who told CNN he made himself the head of the figure and screamed in pain when it was cut. ""I didn't intend for anyone to feel singled out or embarrassed,"" he said. ""But we're talking about female genital mutilation -- is there any comfortable or cozy way to talk about it?"" Liljeroth was scheduled to meet with representatives of the National Association for Afro-Swedes, which has demanded she should step down, on Wednesday evening. The group said it hoped to ensure ""that similar events don't happen again."" ""To participate at a racist manifestation portrayed as art is definitely crossing the line,"" Kitimbwa Sabuni, the group's spokesman, said in a written statement. He said the minister's appearance shows she either supported what the group called a racist event ""or that she has an extremely bad sense of questions of racism."" ""No matter what, the Afro-Swedes no longer have confidence for her as culture minister and demand that she assumes her responsibility and resigns,"" Sabuni said. The event took place at Stockholm's Museum of Modern Art, which was marking World Art Day on Sunday. The museum was closed by a bomb threat Tuesday afternoon, but reopened Wednesday after no explosives were found, spokeswoman Kristin Ek said. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Sweden's culture minister cut a cake shaped like an African woman at a weekend exhibit .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. presidential commission has uncovered more details regarding human experiments conducted by American researchers in Guatemala in the 1940s in which the subjects were exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. The research reaffirms much of what is already publicly known: that between 1946 and 1948, U.S. researchers intentionally infected non-consenting subjects in Guatemala with STDs, in what the commission called a ""clearly unethical historical injustice."" The United States has apologized for the incident, and the government has been sued by some of the victims and their heirs. President Barack Obama asked the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to uncover details of the research and to assure him that current rules protect people from unethical treatment. The commission on Monday said it had completed the first of those tasks, and will present its findings to Obama in September. ""It is important that we accurately document this clearly unethical historical injustice. We do this to honor the victims,"" said commission chair Amy Gutmann. ""In addition, we must look to and learn from the past so that we can assure the public that scientific and medical research today is conducted in an ethical manner. Research with human subjects is a sacred trust. Without public confidence, participation will decline and critical research will be stopped. It is imperative that we get this right."" The scientific investigation, called the U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Disease Inoculation Study of 1946-1948, was conducted to determine the effectiveness of penicillin in treating or preventing syphilis after subjects were exposed to the disease. Gonorrhea and chancres were also studied. Penicillin was a relatively new drug at the time. The tests were carried out on female commercial sex workers, prisoners in the national penitentiary, patients in the national mental hospital and soldiers. According to the study, more than 1,600 people were infected: 696 with syphilis, 772 with gonorrhea and 142 with chancres. The presidential commission reviewed more than 125,000 original documents collected from public and private archives around the country and completed a fact-finding trip to Guatemala. The commission compared its findings in the Guatemala research with similar research that involved intentionally exposing inmates in Terre Haute, Indiana, to gonorrhea in 1943. Among the commission's findings was that many of the same researchers in Terre Haute were also involved in the Guatemala research. ""The key difference between the two research projects was that in Terre Haute the prisoners were fully briefed, volunteered and gave informed consent,"" the commission said in a statement. ""A few years later, the subjects of the same researchers in Guatemala gave no consent."" The Guatemala research has also been compared to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in Alabama. During the 40-year study that began in 1932, doctors observed how the disease progressed in about 400 poor African-Americans who already had the disease. The men were never told they had syphilis and were never treated for it. The test subjects received free medical testing, meals and burial insurance. After the Tuskegee study came to light, the U.S. government reached a $10 million out-of-court settlement with surviving study subjects and the families of those who had died in the course of the experiment.","A presidential commission reaffirms previous reports on experiments in Guatemala .

"(CNN) -- Who wouldn't expect great things from the world's second largest land mass? This is a nation hoarding enough prosperity, natural beauty and curling talent to serve a population a hundred times its size. But Canada is more than elbow room, good roads, respected banks, promo posters of Mounties on horseback, sweet views of Niagara Falls and tired media frenzies about the odd crack-smoking mayor. This country could really brag about all the stuff that truly sets it apart. Not that it ever would. Self-effacing modesty is one the more endearing Canadian virtues -- along with these 10 national assets that really put the ""O"" in Canada. 1. Apologizing . It's not so easy to get a simple apology in most of the world. Being jostled in India. Getting your foot stepped on in Greece. Not having the door held open for you in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. That's just all part of unrepentant life. In Canada, apologies happen constantly -- ""sorries"" flying in from all sides like swarms of affable killer bees. Apologies are issued not just for some negligible mishap, but for actually having the gall to be on the receiving end of one. A Queen's University poll titled ""Sorry ... I'm Canadian,"" found that 90% of Canadians aged 18-25 will immediately apologize if a stranger bumps into them. But while it may be true that some of the ugliest brawls in Canada have been waged over who's sorrier, travelers should be wary of such niceties, notes another Canadian apologist: ""Sometimes we're actually expressing our sympathy for your shortcomings."" 2. Lakes and ""Cottage Country"" Canada has more lakes than any other country -- about 3 million. The province of Ontario alone contains about a third of the world's freshwater, spread over 250,000 lakes. No surprise that ""heading up to the lake"" is more than just a favorite national phrase. It's Canada's sacred version of lighting out for the territory -- but with cottages furnished with Muskoka chairs, Kevlar canoes and competing Gordon Lightfoot and loon mating call soundtracks. Recently, Ontario's prime lake district, Muskoka, got the nod from National Geographic Traveler as the top summer destination -- in the world. Well, yeah, eh? It's beauty up there. 3. Stand-in movie locations . Even if you've never set foot in Vancouver, Halifax or those handful of cities in between, you've frequently been staring right at them without knowing it. Why? Because Hollywood loves making movies in Canada -- big movies -- while passing the settings off as New York City, Wyoming, ancient Persia, the bow of history's most ill-fated oceanliner ... Basically anywhere else but Canada. If you've sat through ""The Incredible Hulk,"" you've visited Toronto's Yonge Street -- at least via celluloid. ""Brokeback Mountain""? That ain't the American West, pardner. It's Southern Alberta's Rocky Mountain country. ""Capote""? You're not in Kansas, Dorothy. But Winnipeg. ""Twilight""? Vancouver. ""Blades of Glory""? Montreal. ""Titanic""? Much of it filmed off the coast of Halifax. And where in the world was Morgan Freeman's shack in ""Unforgiven""? Just up the road from Calgary in the Drumheller Valley -- a moonscape-ish backcountry that's also passed for Egypt, Persia, Armenia and East Africa in several film and TV productions. 4. Air . In a recent national air quality study by the World Health Organization, Canada placed third for the cleanest air on the planet. Until the first and second placers (Estonia and Mauritius) are covered in CNN Travel's ""better than anywhere else"" series, we direct your breath to Canadian cities -- which average a relatively pristine 13 micrograms of PM10 particles per cubic meter. 5. Humor . Canadians are hilarious -- sometimes even intentionally -- as a disproportionate number of comic heavyweights like Jim Carrey, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Dan Aykroyd, Seth Rogen, Mike Myers, Phil Hartman, Michael Cera, Leslie Nielsen and so many others have repeatedly confirmed over the years. What makes Canadians so crazy funny? The subject has launched sociological studies, none of which are funny at all. But even if you've never watched SCTV, can't name a single member of ""The Kids in the Hall"" and weren't aware that SNL was created and produced by a Torontonian, or that Montreal's Just for Laughs Festival is the world's biggest comedy festival, or that the most deadly funny movie sequence ever filmed (the ""Serpentine!"" scene from 1979's ""The In-Laws"") was directed by a dude from Edmonton -- know this: . If there's one thing Canada barrels superbly at home or abroad, for whatever boring reason, it's laughs. 6. Chocolate bars . Just a few giant corporations pump out most of the world's mass market candy bars -- but not always with the same goods under that familiar-looking wrapper. ""Canadian chocolate is higher in fat and it is a higher particle size,"" a Hershey's senior chocolate expert recently noted in the National Post, adding that Hershey's now offers a separate recipe for the more discriminating Canadian chocolate palate. ""Americans tend to gravitate toward a little more of a grittier or even cheesier flavor."" That's why eating any of those generic chocolate bars or local Canadian faves like Caramilk, Aero, Mr. Big, heck even Sweet Marie in Saskatoon, is a creamy, velvety experience. And why a KitKat somewhere else is a gritty, cheesy, polyglycerol polyricinoleate-y one. 7. Ski country . Sitting across the border from Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and Vermont would be intimidating to most countries hawking their own powdery slopes. Not Canada, which boasts some of the best reasons to haul your skis or snowboard a little farther north. In the West, there's Lake Louise, plunked right in gorgeous Banff National Park, and a ring of powder havens throughout eastern British Columbia. Whistler Blackcomb is one of the world's leading ski resorts, getting a ""best in North America"" nod from SKI Magazine last year. In the East, there's Quebec's beer-commercial-fun Laurentians -- where après-ski needs no translation. Heli-skiing? That all started in the Canadian Bugaboos, which remains one of the best places to do it. 8. Nation branding . No national symbol is as ubiquitous as Canada's maple leaf. From Newfoundland to Victoria, it's everywhere you look -- a proud, unrelenting reminder of where you are. Not the United States. Not Australia. Not Nigeria. Canada. The most obsessive leaf activity occurs abroad, where generations of flag-bearing Canadian backpackers are famous for sewing maple leaf patches onto their bags just to make sure everyone's clear at a glance who they are. Not American. Not German. Not Rarotongan. Canadian. See the leaf? Canadian. ""No other country on earth seems to feel the same need to self-identify,"" posts one traveler from an undisclosed country. 9. Highway grub . Road trips are all about the food. At least in places like Alberta or Manitoba, where nothing works up an appetite like hours of sedentary driving along some of the longest, straightest roads known to non-Australian mankind with nothing to do but count Petro-Canada stations -- and pull over for the best comfort food gracing any rest stop. Tim Hortons. Harvey's. Swiss Chalet ... If you don't know these names, it's time to look beyond the Golden Arches. You can eat McNuggets wherever. Nothing says gustatory bliss on the Trans-Canada Highway like a peameal & natural smoked Bacon Bacon burger, or half-chicken plate with Chalet sauce, or a box of Timbits with a double-double coffee. Better grab a butter tart and Nanaimo bar, too. It's a long way from Red Deer to Flin Flon. 10. Adorable terms and phrases . While you'll be hard-pressed to find a real-life, toque-wearin' local who's ever called someone a ""hoser"" or told them to ""take off,"" Canadians do call their two-dollar coins ""Toonies,"" cases of beer ""two-fours"" and napkins ""serviettes"" in polite company. Nowhere else will you be called a ""rink rat"" for loitering at ice arenas. Or be ""given the gears"" if you do something dumb. Or get asked, ""What do you pay for hydro?"" Or alerted that ""your gitch is showing"" if your belt is too loose. Enough said. Jordan Rane is a Toronto native living without apologies (most of the time) in Los Angeles.","Poll titled ""Sorry ... I'm Canadian,"" finds 90% of Canadians aged 18-25 apologize if a stranger bumps them .
Even if you've never visited Canada, chances are you've been staring at it in Hollywood movies .

"(CNN) -- Russia approved the use of military force in Ukraine on Saturday, despite warnings of consequences from the West, and Ukraine responded by saying any invasion into its territory would be illegitimate. The acting prime minister has gone so far as to say that a Russian invasion would mean war and an end to his country's relationship with Russia. But there are so many questions as to how Ukraine arrived at this point: Why is Russia so interested in happenings there? Why does the West want to prevent Russian intervention? How did we get here? Why have thousands of protesters staked their lives, seemingly, on their desire for political change? And why has the government resisted their calls so vehemently? Let's take a look: . 1. Why has Russia gotten so involved? Eastern Ukraine and the Crimea have closer ties to Russia, while Western Ukraine is more friendly with Europe. Many Eastern Ukrainians still speak Russian, and the 2010 presidential elections divided the country with Eastern Ukraine voting heavily in favor of pro-Russia Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. On Saturday, the Kremlin issued a statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Barack Obama that Russia approved military action in Ukraine because it ""reserves the right to defend its interests and the Russian-speaking people who live there."" 2. Hasn't Yanukovych stepped down? The Ukraine Parliament voted him out of power and he has fled to Russia. However, in a press conference Friday, the former President said -- in Russian rather than Ukrainian -- that he was not overthrown. He insisted he was still the boss and that he wants nothing more than to lead his country to peace, harmony and prosperity. While it's unclear if he could return to power, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations blamed members of the European Union for the bloody demonstrations that led to Yanukovych's ouster. 3. What will happen in Ukraine if Russia sends troops there? Top Ukrainian officials, including the acting President and prime minister, have said they are prepared to defend the country. They've also said that any invasion would be illegitimate, a response echoed by the United States, which has told Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty. 4. Would there be international backlash to a Russian incursion? The United Nations has warned Russia against military action, while Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told Putin ""dialogue must be the only tool in ending the crisis."" International leaders have also denounced the prospect of Russian involvement, while Obama has warned there would be consequences if Russia acted militarily. 5. What sort of consequences? Obama hasn't been specific other than to say Russia could face ""greater political and economic isolation"" and that the United States ""will suspend upcoming participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8"" in Sochi. Several Republican leaders in Congress have called on the President to take a tougher stand. 6. What are Obama's options? Sanctions, of course, top the list of options, but the United States will need to prepare for the backlash. Former presidential adviser David Gergen says Putin would consider any sanctions ""small potatoes"" compared to keeping control of Crimea, while Putin could pull his support for Obama's initiative to reduce nuclear threats in the world, including in Iran. Christopher Hill, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Macedonia, Iraq and Poland, says imposing sanctions also raises the risk of alienating a superpower. ""That means 20 years of trying to work with Russia down the drain,"" he said. 7. What started the turmoil in Ukraine? Protests initially erupted over a trade pact. For a year, Yanukovych insisted he was intent on signing a historical political and trade agreement with the European Union. But on November 21, he decided to suspend talks with the EU. 8. What would the pact have done? The deal, the EU's ""Eastern Partnership,"" would have created closer political ties and generated economic growth. It would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion, supporters of the pact said. 9. Why did Yanukovych backpedal? He had his reasons. Chief among them was Russia's opposition to it. Russia threatened its much smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if Ukraine forged ahead. If Ukraine didn't, and instead joined a Moscow-led Customs Union, it would get deep discounts on natural gas, Russia said. 10. Were there any other reasons? Yes, a more personal one. Yanukovych also was facing a key EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: Free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his bitter political opponent. Two years ago, she was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison, in a case widely seen as politically motivated. Her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment. 11. What happened next? Many Ukrainians were outraged. They took to the streets, demanding that Yanukovych sign the EU deal. Their numbers swelled. The demonstrations drew parallels to Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution, which booted Yanukovych, then a prime minister, from office. 12. Who's heading the opposition? It's not just one figure, but a coalition. The best known figure is Vitali Klitschko. He's a former world champion boxer (just like his brother Wladimir). Klitschko heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party. But the opposition bloc goes well beyond Klitschko and the UDAR. There's also Arseniy Yatsenyuk. 13. How did Yanukovych react? In a way that inflamed passions further. He flew to Moscow, where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas. And then, when the demonstrations showed no signs of dying down, he adopted a sweeping anti-protest law. 14. What did the anti-protest law say? The law barred people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission. This sparked concerns it could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech -- and clashes soon escalated. The demonstrators took over City Hall for the better part of three months. 15. But wasn't the law repealed? Yes, ultimately it was. Amid intense pressure, deputies loyal to Yanukovych backtracked and overturned it. But by then, the protests had become about something much bigger: constitutional reform. 16. What change in the constitution did they want to see? The protesters want to see a change in the government's overall power structure. They feel that too much power rests with Yanukovych and not enough with parliament. 17. What did the government do? In late January, the President offered a package of concessions under which Yatsenyuk, the opposition leader, would have become the prime minister and, under the President's offer, been able to dismiss the government. He also offered Klitschko the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues. He also agreed to a working group looking at changes to the constitution. But the opposition refused. 18. Why did the opposition pass on the offer? The concessions weren't enough to satisfy them. They said Yanukovych had hardly loosened his grip on the government, nor had he seemingly reined in authorities' approach to protesters. ""We're finishing what we started,"" Yatsenyuk said. 19. Who was to blame for the clashes? Depends on whom you ask. The government pointed the finger at protesters. The opposition, in turn, blamed the government. 20. What's the takeaway here? Street protests that started in November over a trade pact swelled into something much bigger -- resulting in the former President fleeing to Russia for safety while still claiming to be the official leader of the country. With Russian troops rumored to be preparing for hostilities in the Crimea, the future of the region and the resulting effect on U.S.-Russian relations appears shaky.

"(Health.com) -- The small fraction of women who choose intrauterine devices (IUDs) or under-skin implants as their preferred method of birth control may be on to something: According to a new study, these long-acting forms of contraception are 20 times better at preventing unintended pregnancies than the Pill and other short-term methods. The study, published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, compared the effectiveness of various types of birth control in a group of about 7,500 sexually active women in the St. Louis area. Over a period of three years, 9.4% of women using birth control pills, patches, or vaginal rings became pregnant accidentally, compared to just 0.9% of women who opted for IUDs or implants. The difference in these so-called contraceptive failure rates was especially dramatic among teenagers and young women, a group at high risk for unintended pregnancies. Women under age 21 who used short-term birth control were nearly twice as likely as their older counterparts to become pregnant, whereas the failure rate for IUDs and implants was less than 1% regardless of age. ""It's not that birth control pills aren't effective, because they are -- when they're used perfectly,"" says Jeffery Peipert, M.D., a study author and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical School, in St. Louis. ""But humans aren't perfect, and it's normal to forget to take a pill every day or file for prescription refills every month."" Health.com: What's the best birth control for you? Birth control pills, the method of choice for 28% of U.S. women, are the most commonly used form of reversible contraception, but their effectiveness depends on consistent daily use. Nationally representative surveys have reported failure rates with the Pill similar to those seen in the current study. Patches and rings require less attentiveness than pills, but they still leave room for human error. The birth control patch (known by its brand name, Ortho Evra) needs to be changed weekly, while the vaginal ring (known as NuvaRing) needs to be changed once a month. By contrast, IUDs and implants are designed to be foolproof. An IUD, a T-shaped piece of plastic inserted into the uterus by a gynecologist, can remain in place for five to 10 years. Implants such as Implanon and Nexplanon, matchstick-size devices inserted below the skin on the upper arm that release a slow trickle of hormones, can last up to three years. Despite being far more effective than pills, IUDs and implants -- collectively known as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) -- have proven to be less popular with women. According to the latest government data, just 5.5% of women on birth control use IUDs and less than 1% use implants. Health.com: The worst birth control mistakes . ""When a woman tells her ob-gyn that she wants to go on birth control, most doctors offer the Pill right off the bat,"" Peipert says. ""That needs to change. If there were a drug for cancer that was 20 times more effective, we would obviously recommend that first -- and that's what we should be doing for contraception, as well."" A third type of birth control, the hormone injections sold under the brand name Depo-Provera, had a low failure rate comparable to those of IUDs and implants, the study found. That rate may not accurately reflect the real-world effectiveness of the shots, however, since the study included only women who received them every three months, as required, Peipert says. Eve Espey, M.D., a professor of ob-gyn at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, says doctors in her field have been anxiously awaiting the publication of these findings, which emerged from a broader ongoing study, known as the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, that was developed to promote LARC use in and around St. Louis. ""It definitely confirms what most people in family planning have expected, that the LARC methods are by far the most effective,"" says Espey, who was not involved in the study. ""We've been anticipating this CHOICE data for a while, because it's such a great way to look at outcomes of different contraceptive methods in real life."" Health.com: What's healthier: the pill or an IUD? The CHOICE project, however, differs from real life in key ways that may shed light on why IUDs aren't more widely used. The project, which is funded in part by the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, was purposefully designed to remove all financial barriers to the use of IUDs and implants, which have a high upfront cost -- $500 or more -- and aren't always covered by insurance. All of the study participants, who ranged in age from 14 to 45, received a prescription for their preferred birth control method for two to three years, free of charge. With cost taken out of the equation, more than three-quarters of the participants opted for an IUD or implant -- a proportion roughly 10 times higher than in the general population. In addition, the participants talked with a doctor about the risks and benefits of each birth control method before making a selection. This counseling session also may have helped to encourage IUD and implant use by dispelling many of the misconceptions that surround long-term birth control, Peipert says. Health.com: Common birth control side effects . IUDs, for instance, haven't fully shaken the bad reputation they earned in the 1970s, when an early device known as the Dalkon Shield was pulled from the market after it was found to cause infection and injury. Decades later, some gynecologists still aren't trained to insert IUDs, and others believe that many women -- such as those who have never had children -- are not good candidates for the method, Peipert says. In fact, today's IUDs and implants have been shown to be safe and effective for a wide range of women, including teenagers, Espey says. Women who are interested in trying one should talk to a gynecologist, or more than one, she adds. ""If you're told that you're not a good candidate, you shouldn't necessarily take that at face value,"" she says. ""You might need to take an advocacy role for yourself if you really want the best options available to you.""

"(CNN) -- Inside the Charles Manson room at the Museum of Death in Hollywood, Anne Forde looks at crime scene photos from the 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders. ""I was a kid when he was involved in these crimes,"" says Forde, who grew up in County Cork, Ireland. ""It's just been a fascination for me ever since."" ""His eyes just stand out and look crazy,"" says Debbie Roberts, who was visiting the museum from Kentucky. ""I can see how people followed him."" A few miles away on Saturday mornings, Scott Michaels is hosting the ""Helter Skelter Tragical History Tour."" For $65, you can buy a bus seat to see where the murders took place, as Michaels tells the story of Helter Skelter. ""We have people from around the world that sign up,"" says Michaels. ""We added an additional anniversary tour, which is sold out."" August 9 marks the 45th anniversary of the murders of Sharon Tate and four others on Cielo Drive in the Benedict Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles. Tate, who was 8Â½ months pregnant and married to movie director Roman Polanski, was stabbed 16 times as she pleaded for the life of her unborn child. The next night, supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and Rosemary LaBianca were tortured and killed inside their home near Hollywood. Fast facts: Manson family murders . Since then, Charles Manson, who was convicted of orchestrating the murders, has been the focus of continued fascination. ""People seem to be fascinated by things that are strange and bizarre,"" says Vincent Bugliosi, sitting in his Los Angeles-area living room. Bugliosi is the man who prosecuted Manson and his ""family"" and co-wrote the book ""Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders."" With more than 7 million copies sold, it is still the best-selling true crime book. Bugliosi believes people are still fascinated by the Tate-LaBianca murders for two reasons: the gruesome nature of the murders and the lasting image people have of Charles Manson, with the maniacal stare and the swastika on his forehead. ""The name Manson has become a metaphor for evil, and there's a side of human nature that's fascinated by pure unalloyed evil,"" says Bugliosi. There are, however, people who continue to support Manson. He has received more mail than any other inmate in state history. According to California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Manson still gets about 35 letters a week. Online, there are multiple Charles Manson websites, including mansondirect.com, which features audio messages from Manson in prison. Manson's Facebook page has 70,000 ""likes."" ""This is an unusual case. It's not a whodunnit. This is a why dunnit,"" says Brian Davis, the host of the Internet radio channel TLB, which stands for Tate La Bianca. Davis operates the channel, which has an irregular schedule and averages a few hundred listeners, from his home in Roanoke, Virginia. Davis says he has been studying the Manson case off and on for 10 years and labels himself as ""down the middle."" He thinks a lot of the Manson image was created by Bugliosi and the media, and he wonders if Manson really brainwashed the killers. ""I don't think Manson ordered those murders,"" he says. Manson, who turns 80 in November, has been denied parole 12 times. His next parole hearing isn't scheduled until 2027, when, if he's still alive, he'll be 92 years old.","It's been 45 years since the Tate-LaBianca murders .

"(CNN) -- From the 50th anniversary this year of Betty Friedan's ""The Feminine Mystique'' to the recent PBS documentary ""Makers: Women Who Make America'' that featured Gloria Steinem and scores more women, it's easy to assume that the United States is at the forefront of women's rights. But we're not. Even as the rest of the world celebrates International Women's Day on Friday â€” not much of a holiday here â€” the United States will also stand out as one of the few countries yet to ratify a major United Nations treaty designed to bring equality to women everywhere. Critics of the U.N.'s Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, known as CEDAW, say it doesn't reflect American values enough. Here's what they are missing: The treaty takes American values of equality and women's rights and makes them global norms. Of the 194 U.N. member nations, 187 countries have ratified CEDAW. The United States is among seven countries that have not -- along with the Pacific island nations of Tonga and Palua; Iran, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan -- not the first countries that come to mind when discussing women's rights. President Carter sent CEDAW to the U.S. Senate for advice and consent in 1980. It remains in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The Senate has held hearings on CEDAW five times in the past 25 years but failed each time to bring the treaty to a vote on the floor. Why? Conservative organizations, such as the Home School Legal Defense Association and Concerned Women for America, vehemently oppose the ratification of all human rights treaties. They insist that human rights treaties violate American sovereignty. Thirty-eight Republican senators demonstrated this last December, when they refused to join their more moderate colleagues in ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. CEDAW establishes the moral, civic and political equality of women and protects women's right to be free from discrimination and violence. Thanks to CEDAW, these values have diffused around the world. Conservative critics are wrong when they claim that CEDAW reflects radical feminist views. In fact, a Republican woman, Nixon appointee Patricia Hutar, persuaded the United Nations to draft CEDAW. On January 30, 1974, President Nixon called for the U.S. government to commemorate International Women's Year at all levels. Nixon's announcement won international accolades and prompted government officials from around the world to follow suit. In 1976, President Ford sent a bipartisan delegation comprising many accomplished American women to Geneva to draft the initial text of CEDAW. Hutar's skill as a negotiator proved critical in persuading Communist countries to approve the text of the treaty. The efforts of those American women paid off. CEDAW works. It has empowered civil society organizations to demand that governments respect women's human rights and to adopt policies to limit sex trafficking, domestic violence, child marriage and discrimination in the workplace. Opponents have a point when they note that ratifying this document has not prevented some countries from being the most egregious violators of women's rights. When the most powerful country in the world does not support women's rights, it gives permission for other countries to dismiss their commitment to improving the status of women. With the United States behind it, CEDAW would have even more clout than it does. The United States once led the world in rights for women. In the 1970s, the Democratic and Republican parties supported a wide array of women's rights policies, including an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, publicly funded child care and equal pay for women. These efforts weakened once the Republican Party stopped supporting women's rights. I still believe the United States is one of the best places in the world to be a woman. I would like to see my country once again assert global leadership on women's rights. Ratification of CEDAW is an essential first step.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government shut down at 12:01 a.m. ET Tuesday after lawmakers in the House and the Senate could not agree on a spending bill to fund the government. The two sides bickered and blamed each other for more than a week over Obamacare, the president's signature health care law. House Republicans insisted the spending bill include anti-Obamacare amendments. Senate Democrats were just as insistent that it didn't. Federal employees who are considered essential will continue working. But employees deemed non-essential -- close to 800,000 -- will be furloughed. Most furloughed federal workers are supposed to be out of their offices within four hours of the start of business Tuesday. President Barack Obama issued a statement early Tuesday to military members and Department of Defense employees about the outcome of the shutdown. ""Those of you in uniform will remain on your normal duty status,"" the president said. ""Congress has passed, and I am signing into law, legislation to make sure you get your paychecks on time. And we'll continue working to address any impact this shutdown has on you and your families."" ""To all our DOD civiliansâ€”I know the days ahead could mean more uncertainty, including possible furloughs,"" the president added. ""And I know this comes on top of the furloughs that many of you already endured this summer. You and your families deserve better than the dysfunction we're seeing in Congress. ... That's why I'll keep working to get Congress to reopen our government and get you back to work as soon as possible."" The final hours . The shutdown appeared inevitable Monday night as House Republicans acknowledged they couldn't overcome Senate objections to a proposal that includes provisions aimed at derailing Obamacare. They planned to have another vote overnight that would request a conference with the Senate to work out their differences. But the move, which would not have averted a shutdown, was dismissed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""We will not go to conference with a gun to our head,"" Reid said. Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen said the reason there wasn't a budget deal is because Republicans refused to negotiate months ago. ""They want to go to conference with 45 minutes left,"" Van Hollen said late Monday night. ""That is a recipe for a government shutdown."" Legislative ping pong . For the second time Monday, the Senate rejected a House Republican effort to derail Obamacare by linking it to a proposal that would avert the shutdown. The Senate voted to table House amendments that would have delayed the individual mandate in the health care law and eliminated health insurance premium subsidies for members of Congress, their staffs and the president. In the latest volley of legislative ping pong over a short-term spending plan needed to avoid the shutdown, House Republicans were expected to meet to discuss their next steps. Earlier, Senate Democrats had rejected a House proposal by a 54-46 vote, strictly along party lines. Obama made a previously unscheduled statement to reporters on Monday afternoon, blasting the attempts by House Republicans to undermine Obamacare that he said threaten to harm the economy with a shutdown. ""You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job, for doing what you're supposed to be doing anyway, where just because there's a law there that you don't like,"" the president said. Obama later called Boehner and other party leaders in the House and Senate, the White House said, but a Boehner spokesman indicated there was no breakthrough. Moderate GOP revolt against Boehner? GOP sources told CNN that moderate House Republicans were trying to galvanize what would amount to a rebellion against Boehner and their tea party colleagues by defeating the latest proposed spending plan with attached anti-Obamacare provisions. However, a procedural vote on the measure passed with only six Republicans voting ""no."" Without congressional approval of new spending legislation, parts of the federal government will begin shutting down when the current fiscal year ends at midnight, forcing agencies to furlough thousands of workers and curtail some services until there is a resolution. ""I feel sad about it. We expect more from our Congress,"" said Vick Temple, a worker for the Federal Aviation Administration who said he faced being furloughed in a shutdown. Polls show public opposition to a shutdown, and stocks ended lower Monday on Wall Street due to concerns over the economic impact. The blame game . Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina said on CNN's ""New Day"" that her party continues to be deeply concerned about Tuesday's scheduled opening of Obamacare health insurance exchanges and ""keeping the checkbook out of Barack Obama's hands and the damage can be done there."" Get up to speed on the showdown . Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz, D-Florida, appearing alongside Ellmers, characterized the Republican strategy of tying overall government operations to at least a delay in health care changes as ""irrational."" ""It jeopardizes the economy and it makes no sense,"" she said. Weeks of hot potato . Last week, the Senate voted down a House GOP plan to eliminate funding for Obamacare in a short-term spending plan to keep the government running in the new fiscal year that begins Tuesday. Democrats have pressured Boehner to give up a losing fight over Obamacare forced by tea party conservatives and instead hold a vote on a ""clean"" spending plan that includes no provisions seeking to undermine the health care reforms. Wasserman Schultz predicted that such a measure would pass easily with support from all Democrats and more moderate Republicans. Some Republicans expressed frustration Monday with the tactics of their congressional colleagues. Veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona noted that any attempt to repeal Obamacare would fail because of Obama's veto, which would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate to overcome. ""There's not 67 votes in the United States Senate, therefore, ergo, we're not going to repeal Obamacare,"" McCain said. ""OK? That's it. We may do this for a day. We may do it for a week. We may do it for a month. It's going to end up the same way. "" GOP Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash that whichever party was to blame, a shutdown will make everyone look bad. 10 ways the shutdown would affect you . Obamacare still a GOP focus . Obama and Democrats reject what they call Republican efforts to use the threat of a government shutdown to force negotiations on the president's signature health care reforms. Noting that the 2010 Affordable Care Act has been upheld by the Supreme Court, they say it is settled law that voters endorsed last year by re-electing Obama over GOP candidate Mitt Romney, who campaigned on repealing it. A new CNN/ORC poll shows that Americans are not happy about the prospect of a shutdown, which is happening because Congress has been unable to pass a budget for the new fiscal year that begins Tuesday. A game of chicken between Dems, GOP . According to the poll, 68% of Americans think shutting down the government for even a few days is a bad idea, while 27% think it's a good idea. And it appears most Americans would blame congressional Republicans for a shutdown: Sixty-nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party's elected officials were acting like ""spoiled children."" Democrats, however, weren't far behind: Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they too were acting like spoiled kids. A poll later showed public support for Congress at record low levels. Stock traders also seemed solidly against a shutdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 120 points, or nearly 1 percent, and the other two major indexes also closed lower. Among major economic issues that could result from a shutdown: delays in processing FHA housing loan applications -- a potential drag on the housing recovery -- and the potential loss of government spending that's helping prop up the economy, said Christine Romans, host of CNN's ""Your Money."" ""You've got an economy right now that's very tied to government spending and government contracts, so that could have a ripple effect all across Main Street,"" she said on CNN's ""New Day."" If the government does shut down, it would be the first time it has happened in more than 17 years. That previous shutdown, sparked by a budget battle between Democratic President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress, lasted for 21 days. CNN Poll: GOP would bear the brunt of shutdown blame . While the military will remain on duty, as will many essential public safety, health and welfare operations, many government offices will close. About a quarter of the federal government's 3.3 million employees -- those frequently referred to as ""nonessential"" -- will be told to stay home from work until the shutdown is over. Attorney General Eric Holder and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said essential crime prevention and military services would continue, but some workers would be furloughed. Holder said he would cut his pay by the same amount as the most severely affected Justice Department employees because ""we are all in this together."" Meet the man behind the government shutdown .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Normally, when an elected official has to make difficult choices, balancing ambition with practical concerns, it boils down to a personal decision. But when the official is a political rock star who might just be the first member of his community to become president, the whole decision-making process plays out in public. Take the case of Julian Castro, the San Antonio mayor who has now thrown political observers a curveball by accepting an offer from President Obama to join the Cabinet as secretary of housing and urban development. Castro has been talked about before as a potential 2016 candidate for vice president. The idea of his moving to Washington, if he's confirmed at HUD, is sure to keep tongues wagging for the next couple years. It will also provide plenty of opportunity for unsolicited advice. It seems many people have an opinion on whether Castro has made a shrewd career move or derailed an otherwise promising political future. I've known Castro for about 12 years, and he's a friend. I want what's best for him. I'm just not sure this is it. Why should others care about this choice? Well, for starters, because you can't begin to understand America in the 21st century without an appreciation for the footprint being left by 52 million Hispanics -- a demographic estimated to account for 25% of the U.S. population by 2040. Two-thirds of that population is Mexican or Mexican-American, and Castro is the most prominent politician they have. If there was any doubt about that, it evaporated when Obama chose Castro to give the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and launched him as a national political figure. People should also care because, in the short term, Castro's selection could energize Hispanic voters in time for the midterm elections and help efforts by Democrats to avoid losing more seats in the House or even to retain control of the Senate. It certainly puts Republicans -- who are already smarting from the beating they took from Hispanic voters in the 2012 election, and who have been trying to make amends -- in a tough spot. If they attack Castro during his confirmation hearing, they'll inflame Latinos who will then turn the GOP into a pinata during the midterms. Finally, people should care because so much of our politics has become boring and predictable, and this surprise selection -- and Castro's willingness to accept it -- is neither of those things. On CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley,"" pundits speculated about why a big city mayor would come to Washington midway through the second term of an unpopular administration. The answer, they agreed, may have something to do with the assumption that it might be hard for a Democratic presidential nominee to tap a mayor for a running-mate position coveted by governors and senators. The thinking is that, if nothing else, moving into the federal arena makes Castro more attractive to Hillary Clinton or whoever the party's nominee in 2016 turns out to be. The 39-year-old would replace Shaun Donovan, who would move over to take the helm at the Office of Management and Budget. But why would Castro accept the nomination? HUD is small potatoes. There are four major Cabinet posts: Treasury, Defense, State and Justice. On the prestige meter, HUD is much further down the list. Along with the Labor Department, it is one of those outposts in the federal bureaucracy where the minorities almost always end up in charge. There is no barrier being broken; another San Antonio mayor, Henry Cisneros, in 1993 became the first Hispanic to be housing secretary. And Castro seems content in his hometown of San Antonio, a base from which he can fly around the country delivering high-paying speeches and where he's finishing a memoir which had been due out next year and which may now be released even sooner. He has never struck me as someone who is desperate to go to Washington. And yet, now Castro is ready to start packing. The more I think about it, the more I think I understand why he feels compelled to make this move at this point in his political career. For one thing, Castro knows the subject matter. Big-city mayors deal with housing and urban development, along with economic renewal, on a regular basis. He'll be comfortable at HUD. And it doesn't hurt that, if Castro needs guidance, he can turn to Cisneros, a friend and mentor who knows the department very well, since he ran it for four years during the Clinton administration. For another, Castro's political options in Texas -- a dependably red state -- are limited. He could run for re-election as mayor next year, and serve out what would be his final term until 2017. Then what? He could enter the private sector, and make a comfortable living practicing law, giving speeches, and writing books. But his political career would be over, just like those of many Texas Democrats before him. His decision to join the Cabinet is a wild card, but one that might just keep him in the game.","San Antonio Mayor Castro slated to head Housing and Urban Development department .

"(CNN) -- ACE Rent A Car may not be the best-known player in the car rental industry, but it's best in class for many travelers, a new survey finds. The Indiana-based company was tops in the J.D. Power and Associates 2011 North America Rental Car Satisfaction Study, released Tuesday. ACE received particularly high marks for its prices and shuttle service. Enterprise was in second place, performing especially well among leisure travelers. National ranked third in the study. The survey measures satisfaction with car rental companies in six categories: costs and fees, the pickup process, the return process, the rental car itself, the company's shuttle bus or van, and the reservation process. Travelers' overall happiness with rental car companies increased for a second consecutive year, the study found. ""As positive as this increase in satisfaction is, there remains ample opportunity for rental car companies to further delight their customers in the future,"" said Stuart Greif, a vice president at J.D. Power and Associates. Those improvements could include companies digitally measuring gas tank levels for more accurate charges, retrieving mileage and gas information digitally as customers return cars, and giving real-time estimates of shuttle van arrival times, he said. Meanwhile, a big issue continues to be the amount of time it takes customers to pick up their cars. The average wait time now is 17 minutes, the study found. That's an improvement from 20.5 minutes in 2010 but still way too long for many people. Satisfaction drops considerably among travelers who have to wait more than five minutes to get their car. ""The culture of immediacy creates expectations around timeliness of service that can be challenging to meet,"" said Jessica McGregor of J.D. Power and Associates. The company advised travelers to use kiosks -- if available -- instead of waiting in line at the counter. Very few rental car customers now use kiosks, but those who do tend to be more satisfied with the experience overall, J.D. Power and Associates said. The 2011 North America Rental Car Satisfaction Study is based on more than 12,500 evaluations from business and leisure travelers who rented a car at an airport location. The survey was conducted between January and September.","Study: Travelers' satisfaction with rental car companies increases for a second year .

"(CNN) -- The largest report yet into the extent of female genital mutilation, or cutting, has shed new light onto a practice that affects tens of millions of women and girls worldwide, U.N children's agency UNICEF said. There is some positive news in the new UNICEF report, with data on trends revealing that the practice is becoming less common in more than half of the 29 countries where it is concentrated. U.N. director: 'Women will change the world' But some 30 million girls remain at risk of being cut in the next decade unless efforts to eliminate the practice make more headway. More than 125 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of female genital mutilation in 29 countries across Africa and the Middle East, according to the report, ""Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change."" The practice -- which can carry serious health risks and is seen by the United Nations as a human rights violation -- is found to a far lesser degree in other parts of the world, though the exact number of girls and women affected is unknown, said the report, published Monday. Social acceptance and preservation of virginity are the most commonly cited reasons for carrying it out in most countries, among men as well as women. The adoption by the U.N. General Assembly last December of a resolution intensifying global efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation marked ""a milestone in global efforts to end the practice,"" the report said. CNN Special: Impossible odds, unstoppable girls . But cutting continues in some countries and ethnic groups, despite decades-long efforts to eliminate it -- and despite the fact that laws banning female genital mutilation at all ages have been passed in the majority of African nations. In some communities it is seen as a religious requirement, while in others it's dictated by tradition. ""In many countries, prevalence is highest among Muslim girls and women. However, the practice is also found among other religious communities,"" the UNICEF report said. Cutting is nearly universal in Somalia, Guinea, Djibouti and Egypt, according to the report, but affects only one in 100 girls and women in Cameroon and Uganda. Some girls undergo the practice while still babies, while others are cut as young girls or in their teens. The degree of harm inflicted by the practice also varies across communities. Opinion: 'Women's rights violations not just developing nation issue' ""In Somalia, Eritrea, Niger, Djibouti and Senegal, more than one in five girls have undergone the most radical form of the practice, known as infibulation, which involves the cutting and sewing of the genitalia,"" the report said. The downward trend in the practice is most marked in countries where it is less prevalent, the report said. In Kenya and Tanzania, women age 45 to 49 are about three times more likely to have been cut than girls age 15 to 19, UNICEF found. In Benin, Central African Republic, Iraq, Liberia and Nigeria, adolescent girls are about half as likely to have been cut as women age 45 to 49. Other countries where the practice is more widespread have also registered declines. They include Burkina Faso and Ethiopia and, to a lesser extent, Egypt, Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Sierra Leone, the report said. It also highlighted a gap between the support among women for female genital mutilation and its prevalence. ""In most of the countries surveyed, (the) majority of girls and women who have undergone the practice do not see benefits to it and think that the practice should stop,"" UNICEF statistics and monitoring specialist Claudia Cappa is quoted as saying. ""More mothers are aware"" that female genital mutilation and cutting ""can lead to their daughter's, or a girl's, death,"" she says. ""So, there is a better understanding of the consequences, which, in itself, is very important progress."" Give African women a voice,' say activists . But many mothers who oppose the practice still have their daughters cut because of societal expectations, the study said, indicating that ""efforts to end the practice need to go beyond a shift in individual attitudes and address entire communities."" The study also found that efforts by the many agencies campaigning for change are differentiated for various ethnic groups, some of which cross national boundaries, since cutting is much more common in some groups than others. Men and boys, as well as girls, should be encouraged to talk about the practice, the report said. ""This is especially important since the data indicate that girls and women tend to consistently underestimate the share of boys and men who want (female genital mutilation) to end."" Another factor in eliminating cutting is promoting education and exposure to other communities, it added, with urban, wealthier and more educated families less likely to impose the practice on their daughters. ""As many as 30 million girls are at risk of being cut over the next decade if current trends persist,"" said Geeta Rao Gupta, deputy executive director of UNICEF. ""If, in the next decade, we work together to apply the wealth of evidence at our disposal, we will see major progress,"" she said. ""That means a better life and more hopeful prospects for millions of girls and women, their families and entire communities.""","Data reveal a downward trend in some countries where female genital mutilation occurs .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge declared a mistrial Thursday after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked in the murder trial of a teenager accused of gunning down a gay classmate in their Southern California classroom. Ventura County Superior Court confirmed the ruling in the eight-week trial of Brandon McInerney, who was 14 at the time of the shooting in 2008. The nine-woman, three-man jury panel said its last vote resulted in seven in favor of finding the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, CNN affiliates reported. McInerney was tried as an adult on charges of first-degree murder, use of a handgun and a hate crime. McInerney, now 17, allegedly shot 15-year-old Lawrence King, an eighth grader at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, twice while both were typing papers in a computer lab for their English class, authorities said. King, an openly gay teenager, was seated in the middle of the classroom with two dozen students and their teacher when McInerney allegedly shot him in the back of the head, authorities said. Friends said King was proud of being openly gay. He liked wearing jewelry and makeup to school, and he often wore high-heeled boots with the school uniform. He asked his teachers to call him Leticia instead of Larry. Some students bullied him, pupils said. The prosecution alleged McInerney had planned to shoot King over unwanted sexual advances, and said that McInerney had white-supremacist leanings, according to affiliate KABC. The defense contended McInerney had a violent upbringing. It also argued that King taunted and flirted with McInerney, ultimately sparking the fatal confrontation, KTLA reported. The trial was held in Chatsworth, in neighboring Los Angeles County, because the defendant successfully sought a change of venue in the high-profile case, said Ventura County Chief Deputy District Attorney Mike Frawley. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Lawrence King, 15, was shot in the back of the head in English class in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- When patients walk in the door at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, they're handed a form with more than 75 questions about their family history, current medications and symptoms. They have to answer many of the same questions when they visit radiology. Then again when they get lab work done. And the next time they come to the medical center, they fill out the paperwork all over again. The long, redundant process is extremely error-prone, says Subha Madhavan, director of biomedical informatics at Georgetown. Handwriting often makes answers illegible. Questions get skipped. Even inputting data into the hospital's computer system can lead to mistakes. Collecting accurate data is crucial, not only for patient care but for research, Madhavan says. That's why she's working with Georgetown's cancer clinics to roll out a tablet app called Tonic that aims to make the intake of patient information feel less like a chore. The app uses colorful graphics and interactive features to reduce literacy barriers and move patients through the questionnaire. For instance, it asks you to slide a button along the bottom of a birthday cake to determine your age, or to rate your pain on a scale of happy green to angry red. The app is also intuitive, skipping questions about your mother's breast health if you say you have no family history of cancer. Along the way, Tonic provides pop-up educational boxes for patients who are unfamiliar with certain medical terms. ""Many organizations are moving toward this electronic data capture,"" Madhavan says. ""It really allows for better patient engagement."" Patient engagement is the buzzword du jour in the medical community, says Sterling Lanier, CEO and co-founder of Tonic Health. With the Affordable Care Act, hospital reimbursement will be partially tied to patient-reported outcomes, or how well patients perceive a facility treated them. ""Health care is the ultimate consumer product -- we all consume it,"" Lanier says. ""We need to think of patients as consumers. They have the same motivations and mindsets."" How the cell phone can improve health care . Tonic is working with large medical communities, including the Mayo Clinic, UCLA, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Kaiser Permanente. Clients find they can ask patients up to 40% more questions by using the app, Lanier says. ""Why is that important? The more we know about somebody, the better we can treat them at a lower cost,"" he says. The app also offers doctors a real-time risk assessment. When patients submit their questionnaires, the data go straight to doctors' tablets. For example, using information on a patient's family history, daily nutrition and exercise habits, the app can determine his or her risk for heart disease. If it's high, the app flags that for the doctor. ""You might be there for a cough, but the doctor says, 'Let's talk about this,' "" Lanier says. ""We're helping people not get lost in the shuffle."" Digital health for kids, seniors and workout buffs . Patients are ""universally enthusiastic"" about using Tonic, says Dr. Eric Esrailian, vice chief for the digestive diseases and gastroenterology department at UCLA. UCLA began using the app last year. Esrailian says he was worried initially that less tech-savvy patients would have difficulty using a tablet, but he says the app's format makes it accessible for everyone. Doctors in his department are also happier because they're getting completed surveys with accurate information, Esrailian says. ""We can spend more time actually talking to the patient and focusing on health care,"" he says. Moving forward, Esrailian says he would like to see patient intake information integrated with electronic health care records. These records should be interactive, he says, so clinicians could schedule tests or consult on other doctors' patients. Georgetown's Madhavan says questions are often raised about electronic health records and storing patients' personal medical information ""in the cloud."" Lanier says Tonic is fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, but the discussion needs to be ongoing as the medical industry moves more toward mobile health. ""The more we talk to clients, the more cloud-based computing is seen as inevitable,"" Lanier says. ""Some are very excited. ... Some are resigned to it.

"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- Variously described as a genius and a maverick, for six decades Luigi Colani has created beautiful, pioneering design -- a perfect marriage of form and function. A true visionary, he says he has designed thousands of objects -- everything from cameras, to tea pots and sunglasses. But it is his transport designs that are most famous, bearing his trademark of streamlined forms inspired by nature. ""Nature had hundreds of millions of years to refine their things, we have only stupid 100 years of aerodynamics,"" he says. ""So nature is not better -- there's only nature. Our laws are stupid ... they are not ready yet."" Studying aerodynamics at Paris-Sorbonne University in the late 1940s, Colani considered how birds were able to fly and then used those postulations in aircraft design. He did the same when it came to designing ships, this time taking inspiration from the sea creatures he had watched while scuba diving. A man with the foresight to realize that environmental sustainability would play a key role in future product design, in 1971 he turned his efforts to changing the design of trucks, which he felt were not aerodynamic or eco-friendly. ""Twenty-five or 30 years ago I designed streamline trucks that consume less fuel,"" he says. ""The industry, stupid as they are, they didn't get this message; they consumed gasoline by the billions ... if they had adopted my thing, the air would be better today. ""Look at the trucks -- they are square and push an enormous amount of air in front of them so they are not aerodynamic. ""I started with my knowledge of aerodynamics to design streamlined trucks and I'm world champion at the moment because my latest model is consuming 50% less fuel without changing the engine, just through the shape."" To promote his streamlined design, Colani says he plans to take his trucks on tour around the world next year. But despite environmentally friendly principals much of Colani's work has remained in the conceptual stages -- an inspiration for other designers rather than a commercial product. Colani believes that engineers and manufacturers these days are too conservative. He says the financial crisis is stopping companies taking chances on innovative designs and argues that with all the new technology and materials available, people need to take creative risks. ""All kinds of transport must be done but better,"" he says. ""We have the knowledge today, we have the technology today, we have the materials today. But we don't have the brains and the companies who should say yes to good ideas. ""There are too many conservative brains in positions where they should not be conservative. They should go ahead to give the youngsters jobs, ideas and freedom to think."" Now aged 83, and retaining his flair for the flamboyant and futuristic, the German designer doesn't look like he is planning to slow down anytime soon. ""I sat yesterday night, all night through, and I designed the most sensational supermarket in the world,"" he says. ""It's nonstop -- sometimes it's a simple lamp for the desktop, for the table, and sometimes it's a high-speed train or super car."" He is a professor at several Chinese universities and, as befits his belief in young people, says he is to begin the world's first biodesign professorship in Milan next year, giving him the chance to share his knowledge and unique outlook with aspiring designers. But despite the generation gap, Coloni has no fear of being left behind when it comes to the latest trends and technologies. ""I have done everything, but everything changes every five years,"" he says. ""We have new wisdom, new electronics ... (it's not that) I'm not up-to-date -- I am 20 years ahead, mamma mia! People need at least 20 years to come up to my level that I have at the moment!""","Luigi Colani is a hugely influential industrial designer .

"London (CNN) -- Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, will not attend Wednesday's opening ceremony or subsequent competitions in the Invictus Games for injured veterans in London, Kensington Palace said. Royal officials confirmed Monday that Prince William and Kate are expecting their second child. As during her first pregnancy, she is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or acute morning sickness. The condition involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy. Catherine is being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace and didn't accompany Prince William on a planned visit Monday to Oxford. A decision will be made closer to the time on whether she takes part in a forthcoming visit to Malta, the palace added. 'Inspirational event' The Invictus Games, inspired in part by the U.S. Warrior Games held in Colorado, are the brainchild of William's younger brother, Prince Harry. Some 400 competitors from 13 nations will take part in the sporting event for injured service members from the armed forces of nations that have served alongside each other, including Britain, the United States and Canada. In a video message to international competitors on Monday, Harry said it would be an ""inspirational event."" The athletes will compete in nine sports over four days in facilities built for the 2012 London Olympics. Why does the 'spare heir' matter? 'Tricky few days' William told reporters in Oxford that the couple were thrilled and that Catherine was ""feeling OK."" ""It's been a tricky few days,"" he said. ""We're hoping things settle down soon and she feels better."" The couple's first child, Prince George, was born in July 2013. The second child will become fourth in line to the British throne. Prince Charles is first in line, followed by William, Prince George and then eventually the new baby. The new child will knock future uncle Prince Harry down to fifth. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, will not be attending the Invictus Games, palace says .

"(CNN) -- The editor of Guns & Ammo magazine apologized to readers and resigned immediately, earlier than planned, after he published a column advocating gun control, enraging his readers. Editor Jim Bequette wanted to ""generate a healthy exchange of ideas on gun rights"" when he published a commentary by Dick Metcalf, who wrote that he supported regulations on firearms. Instead, the column in the December issue ""aroused unprecedented controversy"" among readers who began ""questioning 'Guns & Ammo's commitment to the Second Amendment,"" Bequette wrote in his apology. Bequette also fired Metcalf, a gun writer who had written the Firearms Law column for the magazine's sister publication, Shooting Times. Metcalf couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Opinion: Gun control is not the answer . In his recent commentary, Metcalf wrote about how ""way too many gun owners still seem to believe that any regulation of the right to keep and bear arms is an infringement"" prohibited by the Second Amendment. ""The fact is, all constitutional rights are regulated, always have been, and need to be,"" Metcalf wrote. After a readership uproar, Bequette said his magazine has an ""unwavering"" commitment to the Second Amendment. ""In publishing Metcalf's column, I was untrue to that tradition, and for that I apologize,"" Bequette wrote in a column dated Wednesday. ""I made a mistake by publishing the column. I thought it would generate a healthy exchange of ideas on gun rights. I miscalculated, pure and simple. I was wrong, and I ask your forgiveness,"" he continued. Plans were already in place for a new editor to take over the magazine on January 1, but that new editor, Eric R. Poole, who ran Guns & Ammo's special interest publications, was installed immediately, Bequette said. State battles intensify on access to guns . Among the comments generating discussion on the magazine's Facebook page was Trace Simek's declaration that he was canceling his subscription and boycotting parent firm InterMedia Outdoors, which describes itself as ""the premier outdoor sports-oriented media group in the United States."" Wrote Simek: ""It takes more than one Elmer Fudd to get a pro-gun control agenda editorial in the pages of a formerly-relevant national firearms industry publication: your apology rings false, and smacks of having been cobbled together as a reaction to an unexpected deluge of negative sentiment."" Gary Graf said he feared the column would energize gun control efforts -- what he called the anti-Second Amendment crowd. ""Publishing Metcalf's back page read was like throwing a bucket of blood in shark infested waters, especially here in California,"" Graf wrote. ""We are one step away from confiscation here as it is, and the anti 2A crowd will be further emboldened by this, especially from something as rock solid as Guns and Ammo. I sincerely hope we can recover from this, but in my state, the champagne corks are already popping."" Many readers, however, defended the column. ""It is sad to see that G&A will bend so easily and that their readers are so blind and fail to understand that some regulation is necessary,"" Kevin Smith wrote.

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday that left 13 dead, we have seen the resurrection of an all-too-familiar debate: Did violent video games make the killer do it? Reports suggest that the gunman, Aaron Alexis, played quite a bit of violent video games. Friends have said to reporters that his heavy game use, described as up to 16 hours at a time, may help explain his actions. Just as quickly, video game fans have jumped to defend the violent first-person shooting games. ""Don't Blame Violent Video Games for Monday's Mass Shooting"" said the headline of an Atlantic op-ed. The problem is that people are looking for a yes-or-no answer about the role of video games in violence, when there is none. Violent video games alone likely didn't cause Alexis to go on his rampage. But these games aren't harmless, either. Recent reports suggest he may have been mentally ill and had anger control issues. But it isn't hard to believe that video game use may have been a contributing factor. My colleagues and I found that typical college students who played violent video games for 20 minutes at a time for three consecutive days showed increasingly higher levels of aggressive behavior each day they played. If that's what happens to typical college students, how might someone like Alexis react to playing for 16 straight hours? What if he does this for months or years? Other researchers have found similar results. My colleagues and I conducted a comprehensive review of 136 articles reporting 381 effects involving over 130,000 participants around the world. These studies show that violent video games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), and aggressive behavior. Violent games also decrease helping behavior and feelings of empathy for others. The effects occurred for males and females of all ages, regardless of what country they lived in. Despite the evidence, many people still deny violent media effects for a variety of reasons that I summarized in a Psychology Today piece. Alexis was not the first mass killer to have an obsession with violent video games. Adam Lanza, who killed 26 children in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was also said to be a fan of first-person shooting games. Other killers have been found to be avid players. The effects of these games go beyond making players more aggressive. In our research, we found that people who played first-person shooting games were more accurate than others when firing a realistic gun at a mannequin -- and more likely to aim for and hit the head. Police haven't released details of the Navy Yard shootings, but it is possible that Alexis was a more accurate shooter because of the time he spent playing video games. That's an inconvenient fact that you don't often hear defenders of the games talk about. But the argument I hear most often is that video games can't be dangerous because millions of people play these games without becoming violent. No doubt, most players don't become violent. That's because they come from good homes, aren't victims of bullying, don't have mental health issues, and don't have many of the other risk factors for violence. But what about players who already are predisposed to violence? Killers like Aaron Alexis aren't typical. They have a lot going against them, such as mental illness. Violent video games are just one more factor that may be pushing them toward violence. We don't have a lot of control over many of the factors that can contribute to violent behavior. But we have some control over violent video games. We can make it more difficult to get access to them. We can strengthen our laws against teens acquiring these games. Parents can keep the games out of their homes and help their children avoid them at friends' houses. As a society, we should do all we can to make violent rampages like the one in Washington less likely, even if we can't stop them entirely. Controlling the use of violent video games is one step we can take to help protect our society from violence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brad Bushman.","Aaron Alexis killed 13 people at Washington Navy Yard on Monday .

"(CNN) -- The Republican Senate primary in Mississippi had long been in the spotlight over nasty politics, but events just prior, during and now after the vote have placed the race in its own unusual category. Thad Cochran and state Sen. Chris McDaniel squared off months ago in what was viewed as a potential bellwether between the larger fight taking place nationally between the arch conservative tea party and establishment Republicans. It was cast as youth and fresh ideas against veteran incumbency and politics as usual. Spending was up, ads were intense, and the vote was expected to be close. The general election was considered pro forma in the reliably Republican state. This primary would decide who would go to Washington. But late in the game, things took a bizarre turn and have gotten more complicated since the June 3 primary resulted in a runoff, which Cochran won three weeks later. Here are the five most unusual moments: . 1. Dirty tricks: In May, three tea party supporters and apparent allies of McDaniel were arrested for conspiring to photograph Cochran's bedridden wife in a hospice in an apparent case of political dirty tricks. Rose Cochran suffers from dementia and has lived in a nursing home for 14 years. The photo of her surfaced in a political attack ad on YouTube that aimed to smear Cochran, The Mississippi Clarion-Ledger reported. McDaniel's campaign denied any connection to the matter. Then, after the runoff, one of those charged with conspiracy in the photo scandal, Mark Mayfield, died in an apparent suicide at his home. It remains under investigation. 2. Crying foul: Separated by less than 1,500 votes following the primary with McDaniel ahead, the two then turned their attention to a runoff won by Cochran with a narrow, but more comfortable margin of nearly 7,000 votes. McDaniel has cried foul and won't concede. He furiously contends nearly 5,000 votes should be discounted due to alleged fraud after Cochran and his allies courted African-Americans and other traditional Democrats to push him over the finish line in the crossover tally. McDaniel camp gathers evidence as it prepares legal challenge . And they're still counting. McDaniel's campaign and its tea party supporters are making the rounds of all 82 counties to look into voting records and still have a dozen stops to make. 3. $1,000 Reward: On Thursday, McDaniel's campaign announced $1,000 rewards for evidence of voter fraud. But there's a catch, evidence must lead to ""the arrest and conviction"" of those involved in any fraud and will be awarded to up to 15 instances. McDaniel's campaign is fundraising for its legal fund, which will underwrite the bounty. Two allegations may shed some light as to why McDaniel called the runoff a ""sham"" in a recent email to supporters. Steve Fielder, a pastor in Mississippi, alleged the Cochran campaign was offering $15 for voters to support Cochran at the polls. Fielder made the claims in a paid interview with an independent filmmaker. Another allegation comes from a more official source: the election coordinator for Hinds County Democratic Party official. Claude McInnis, alleged that the chairman of the county's Republican Party worked with McInnis to allow voters who had voted for a Democrat in the primary to cast a ballot in the runoff -- which is illegal. McInnis told Breitbart News that he'd ""guess"" about 3,000 votes in Hinds County should be obviated. 4. Call-in crashers: Critics of Cochran's election strategy crashed a call with reporters on Tuesday. Charles Johnson, a political blogger critical of Cochran's campaign, apparently obtained and subsequently tweeted out the call's dial-in code to his nearly 6,000 followers. Cacophony ensued when at least one caller repeatedly interrupted campaign spokesman Austin Barbour with a question: . ""Since black people harvested cotton, why is it OK to harvest their votes? Why is it OK to harvest the votes of black people?"" the caller said. Barbour offered to answer the anonymous caller's questions along with reporters' inquiries at the end of the call, but the call hijacker persisted. Just hours before, Barbour slammed the McDaniel campaign during a press conference, urging his opponents to ""put up or shut up"" with their accusations of voter fraud. 5. Lawsuit: True the Vote, a conservative election watchdog, filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the Mississippi secretary of state and the state's Republican party calling for full, unrestricted access to voting records. The state GOP chairman, Joe Nosef, said in a statement that True the Vote's lawsuit is based on a ""misunderstanding of both Mississippi law"" and the state party's role in the election. Logan Churchwell, True the Vote's spokesman, said the ""lawsuit is filed the way it is"" and the group has no plans to remove the Mississippi GOP from the receiving end of the suit. Churchwell said the state party was included because of the ""shared responsibility"" between state officials and the state's Republican party. ""We're not singling them out,"" Churchwell said.","McDaniel's campaign is offering a $1,000 reward for evidence of voter fraud .

"(CNN) -- If Super Bowl Sunday is a day you look forward to with great anticipation each year, if it is a day that you equate with excitement and good times, there's something you should know: . You may have a politician to thank for your happy feelings. On the other hand, if Super Bowl Sunday is a day you dread each year, if you are dismayed by the notion that the day has turned into a lockstep secular holiday during which most of the nation seems hypnotized for hours on end, there's something you should know: . You may have a politician to blame for your grumpy feelings. In both cases, it's the same politician: . President Theodore Roosevelt. A persuasive argument can be made that, were it not for what Roosevelt did during a meeting in the White House toward the end of 1905, football as we know it today would not be a part of American life. There never would have been a National Football League -- at least not the wildly popular NFL that has become such a sports, business and cultural institution -- and Americans would almost certainly be spending Super Bowl Sunday in a completely different way. Here's the short version of what happened: . Early in the 20th century, football, as played on college gridirons, was something close to a street fight. The rules were lax at best, and were routinely ignored. During the 1905 season alone, 18 college and amateur players died. And despite the growing violence (or, who knows, maybe because of the growing violence), fans were flocking to the games -- the sport was gaining followers. So, if the fans liked what they were seeing, what was the problem? The problem was that a serious movement was afoot to ban the sport -- to get rid of football. Remember, the NFL did not exist -- the college game was the top level of the sport. Harvard's president, Charles W. Eliot, was leading the charge to abolish football, and it began to look as if he and his allies had a chance of doing just that. To give you an idea of just how seriously the get-rid-of-football movement was being taken, the New York Times ran an editorial expressing concern over ""Two Curable Evils"" in American life: lynchings and football. Enter Theodore Roosevelt. There is ample historical documentation of what Roosevelt did, but as my guide through the thicket that football entered and from which it eventually emerged and thrived, I sought the assistance of author John J. Miller, whose meticulously researched book, ""The Big Scrum: How Teddy Roosevelt Saved Football,"" is the gold standard. Roosevelt, Miller told me, loved football, but had never played the game -- by the time he was president, Roosevelt cut a brawny, outdoorsmanlike, Hemingwayesque figure (well, Hemingway hadn't been heard of in those years, but you get the picture), yet as a boy he was small, sickly and wore eyeglasses. When he was serving in the White House and football was under fire, he wanted the game to survive, ""but he realized that the critics had a point. ... He loved the sport and thought it was great, but he recognized there was a threat to it. ... He was concerned that we would lose the game."" Thus, Roosevelt convened a meeting in the White House of the most influential men in college football. Present were Walter Camp, the leading figure in the formative years of the game, as well as representatives from Harvard, Princeton and Yale. According to Miller, Roosevelt told them: ""Football is on trial. Because I believe in the game, I want to do all I can to save it."" He impressed on them that genuine, substantive changes must be instituted. Miller said that Roosevelt did not use the ""big stick""-- he did not threaten and he did not pound the table. ""I see nothing but levelheadedness on Roosevelt's part,"" Miller said. ""He was a great politician. He knew how to negotiate and make a point."" (Roosevelt, after all, would win the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating a treaty between Russia and Japan, who went to war in 1904). With the football men, Miller told me, Roosevelt certainly had ""sufficient skills to bring people to the table and bring concessions and agreement."" He got it. There was some resistance during and after the meeting, but eventually football's leaders would agree to get rid of many of the elements that had turned the sport into all-but-unregulated brutality. Rugby-style mass formations, and gang tackling, were outlawed; the distance needed for a first down was changed from five yards to ten, which made it essential to come up with plays that didn't necessarily go straight through the center of the line; a neutral zone was instituted at the line of scrimmage; and -- most important -- a new kind of play was put into the rulebook: . The forward pass. ""It revolutionized the game,"" Miller said. ""It spread out the action. It opened up the field."" Football became more thrilling to watch; the college game boomed, the NFL was born. Speaking of which: With today's new concerns about football violence and long-term injuries, could a president in the 21st century convene a meeting to try to accomplish what Roosevelt did? John Miller doubts it. ""One reason a president of the United States might not get involved is fear of public failure,"" he said. There was no Internet when Roosevelt brought the football men to the White House; there was no television; there were no radios in American homes. He had been able to pull the whole thing off relatively quietly. If football leaders were called to the White House today, the whole country would know it in advance, and for any president, ""the risk of getting involved at that level is the risk of not succeeding."" So, I asked, on Super Bowl Sunday, what is the proper way to regard Teddy Roosevelt? It's simple, Miller said: ""He was football's indispensable fan."" Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- ""What does this thing do?"" That's what I asked the garbage man one afternoon many years ago when we had Truck Day outside Cherokee Elementary. At least I think it was Truck Day. There were lots of trucks. And our teachers encouraged us to look at them and ask questions. So, I'm pretty sure it wasn't sex-ed. (God, I hope not.) Anyway, the garbage man smiled and answered my question. ""Well, this makes the mechanical arm go down. Here, try it."" Me at the helm of a steel hydraulic grabbing device in the vicinity of small children. What could possibly go wrong? I pulled the lever. Things moved. Noises were made. Nothing went wrong. And to this day, it's pretty much the highlight of my life. I should've been a garbage man. Instead I became a journalist. (I repeat: I should've been a garbage man.) Because big trucks are awesome. Especially when you're a kid. Richard Janney knows all about this. The 42-year-old legal recruiter from the suburbs of Chicago has two boys, 9 and 3. And the youngest is completely obsessed with trucks. Janney explains that his little one is over the moon when it comes to big equipment. ""Like, stop and pull over and watch an active construction site for 10 or 20 minutes kind of excitement."" So, he does. That's just being a good dad. But one day, back in early July while taking a roadside pause with his son, Janney looked out upon the broken land and saw an excavator in a whole new light. In this great, massive machine he suddenly saw beauty. Like Orson Welles slathered in baby oil. (Bad comparison. I don't know what just happened there.) As Janney looked out over the construction site with this heightened appreciation for machinery, it was then that he decided he would go home and paint the excavator for his son. He could already picture it. ""I've always been obsessed with van Gogh,"" Janney says. ""I had been trying to do paintings that emulated his style for about a year."" So, in paying homage to ""Starry Night,"" he painted ""Quarry Night."" And it was magnificent. Janney posted an image of his painting online and, immediately, people were enthusiastic. Hundreds asked him if they could buy prints. Not bad for a former lawyer with largely untapped artistic ability. You see, for years, Janney was a litigator for a big firm. And he hated it. ""I was willing to crawl through a sewer pipe like Tim Robbins did in Shawshank Redemption just to get out,"" he said. I can't even imagine. Or maybe I just don't want to. But he made it out. ""I have a lot more time for my family, which is why I'm able to pull over and watch construction equipment when my boys see one in action. We also watch trains a lot."" (Note: These are real things you can see when you stop clicking through cat videos on your iPad. However, be warned that doing so requires leaving the house and wearing pants. Just FYI.) Of course, getting out of a busy law career also allowed Janney more time to further explore this passion for art, despite the fact that he has no formal training. When he was younger he drew a lot, eventually delving into the world of cartoons. In college, Janney even penned a strip called ""Pierre the French Guy."" That one almost got syndicated. Painting came much later, about 10 years ago. Which ultimately led to ""Quarry Night."" Soon after that, Janney brushed another truck-inspired masterpiece: ""Vincent Van Dozer."" Once again he had an online hit. And it was another fine example of hidden artistic talent being discovered on the Internet. In all, it's a small body of work -- there are only two truck paintings so far -- but Janny's already getting commissions from construction companies, engineers, and manufacturers. He says, ""One guy told me that he was so happy to see that someone else saw those machines as works of art."" Like Orson Welles slathered in baby oil. (Nope. Still a bad comparison.)

"(CNN) -- Lori Raines and her mother were hunting for deals at post-Christmas sales in 2009 when Raines' left leg involuntarily turned inward and an excruciating pain shot through it. At first, she thought the pain was the result of a 2005 operation to fix a herniated disc in her lower back. It wasn't. As a massage therapist, yoga instructor, aspiring artist and mother, she could not afford to lose mobility. But within a couple of days, Raines was practically bedridden. She began taking a number of medicines and steroids that changed her personality, caused friends to abandon her and destroyed her marriage. But nothing stopped the pain or involuntary movement in her leg. ""I lost everything,"" she says. Finally, eight months and about 30 doctors' opinions later, she was diagnosed with dystonia, a little-known but the third most common movement disorder. ""If you have something invisible going on, then it's all subjective,"" the 41-year-old says. ""Dystonia doesn't show up on MRIs and it doesn't show up on tests."" Raines hasn't been able to work, slowly watching dystonia spread from her legs to her arms to her neck. Forced to get around on crutches or in a power chair, the former dancer is mostly confined to her Hendersonville, North Carolina, home. ""You don't die from dystonia,"" she says. ""But you want to. It's sort of like a life sentence, as opposed to a death sentence."" Dystonia is often cloaked in mystery and can take years to diagnose. In most cases, dystonia's cause is unknown, and there is no cure. Patients and medical professionals agree dystonia awareness lags far behind other movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Dystonia is ""characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both,"" according to the article ""Phenomenology and classification of dystonia: A consensus update,"" published this year by an international panel of dystonia researchers. Dystonia can be divided into primary and secondary types, says Dr. H.A. Jinnah, director of the Dystonia Coalition and professor in the department of neurology, pediatrics and human genetics at Emory University. It is difficult to quantify exactly how many people suffer from it. Under the National Institutes of Health guidelines, Jinnah says pure or primary dystonia is identified as a rare disorder, but mixed or secondary dystonia occurs frequently. Combining the two classifications makes dystonia a common disorder, he says, ""because we would have to include cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease and a whole load of others."" There are two common treatments for dystonia; neurotoxin injections, such as Botox, and deep brain stimulation, which requires an operation to place a neurostimulator in the brain. The stimulator sends electrical currents to parts of the brain that control muscle movement. Certain forms of dystonia have been linked to genetics, environmental or brain damage. But scientists are still trying to determine exactly what causes the disorder. ""What all of us would like, and most especially our patients, is a medication so that they don't have to get injections or brain surgery,"" Jinnah says. ""That requires that we know something about the cause."" Cervical dystonia, which causes the neck and sometimes the shoulders to contract involuntarily into uncomfortable positions, is the most common form. Cris Rogers, 46, says he believes he developed cervical dystonia due to birth complications. He didn't begin experiencing symptoms until his teens and wasn't properly diagnosed until he was 36. ""Even world-class orthopedists missed this diagnosis by a country mile,"" he says. Rogers calls having cervical dystonia a ""gift"" compared with other forms out there. He is able to treat it with quarterly Botox injections. ""There is an emotional aspect to dystonia that people don't get,"" he says. ""You feel hopeless."" Yet there is no guarantee the Botox will always be an effective treatment. ""If you have relief and the symptoms return, that is a level of pain that is hard to describe,"" he says. ""Because you know what it is like to feel good."" Rogers is a member of the Facebook page Neuronauts, a closed dystonia support group with about 650 members that Raines created in 2012. Raines says she encouraged the Neuronauts to post their stories on CNN's iReport in honor of Dystonia Awareness Month. ""We are isolated as a whole,"" she says of the group and people who suffer from dystonia. ""We have no support. We have no money. We're just trying to keep ourselves alive."" Michele Weber, a mother of two who has a Ph.D. in political science, is also a Neuronauts member. Like Raines, she has multiple forms of dystonia that affect her neck, limbs and facial muscles. She began experiencing symptoms as a child and started seeking medical opinions in her 20s. But Weber says she wasn't diagnosed until her 40s. ""(Dystonia) is devastating to people socially and economically,"" the 47-year-old says. ""We're not the glamour illness. We don't have the celebrity spokesman."" Weber's peers are often shocked to hear she works as a financial adviser, an ""assumption"" that her visible symptoms are indicative of ""lesser intelligence,"" she says. She bucks her natural tendency to keep personal issues private because she believes raising awareness is key to advancing treatment and a cure. ""Until I know that everybody is diagnosed or have adequate treatments, I'll keep being a big mouth about this,"" she says. Like Rogers, Weber considers herself fortunate because she has her husband's support and quality care from a doctor she trusts. Her symptoms constantly limit basic abilities such as using her hands and legs. ""I am disabled -- no more, no less,"" she says. ""All of our abilities are temporary."" All three agree that the medical community's lack of understanding of dystonia contributes to the public's lack of awareness. Dystonia's wide variety of forms has caused a lag in research and treatment, says Dr. Mahlon DeLong, medical director of the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation and professor of neurology at Emory. ""There was a period of time in the '50s, '60s and '70s when physicians thought this could be psychogenic,"" he says, meaning it originated in the mind. ""It was a very unfortunate time."" DeLong says that the medical community now understands dystonia's symptoms are not psychological and that the recent discovery of new genes creates opportunities for advancements in treatment -- and may lead eventually to finding a cure. ""We're beginning to understand the molecular disturbances in the brain,"" he says. Identifying the genes that may be involved in dystonia will allow researchers to learn about their different mutations, Jinnah says. These findings will then enable scientists to understand better how the mutations alter patients' biochemistry and how the mutations affect the brain's normal neurological functions. But DeLong also says that not all forms of dystonia are genetic and so gene mapping is not necessarily a Rosetta stone for grasping dystonia. ""I think we're on the edge of discovery and better therapy,"" DeLong says. ""Some of the new approaches that are coming out will prove very affective for dystonia."" More funding and research cannot come soon enough for Raines, who says her pain is constantly fluctuating between a four and an eight on a scale of 10. She can still drive short distances, getting out about three times a week to go grocery shopping and take her son to school. In August, she will enter her first art show since being diagnosed with dystonia. But she devotes the rest of her time to supporting and encouraging fellow Neuronauts. She says people diagnosed with dystonia need to vocalize what they are going through. ""My background is all about expressiveness and being creative,"" she says. ""The more you can express yourself, the more healthy you are on a cellular level.""","Dystonia is often cloaked in mystery and difficult to diagnose .

"(CNN) -- Grim, unyielding and violent reality is beginning to confront the American political establishment with facts from which it cannot hide. For 35 years, since Iranians seized the American Embassy on November 4, 1979, and kept the Americans in it as hostages, the United States has been at war with radical Islamists. They knew it. We hid from it. Year after year since then, radical Islamists have grown more militant, more sophisticated and more numerous. Now, in an arc of terror from Boko Haram in Nigeria through Hamas in Gaza to ISIS in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, there is a clear wave of vicious religious warfare being waged against civilization by fanatics who openly promise and engage in genocidal killing. To understand why I link ISIS, Hamas and Boko Haram, consider the language of their own statements. Why not take them at their word? ISIS has made its murderous intentions painfully clear. It has proven in town after town that it will force people to convert to Islam or it will kill them in numbers that are now being called genocidal. As President Obama said in his speech Thursday night, ""Many thousands of innocent civilians are faced with the danger of being wiped out."" The group has also made clear that it views its mission as a worldwide war. ""I say to America that the Islamic caliphate has been established,"" a spokesman for the group said Thursday. He warned that the group will attack America and ""will raise the flag of Allah in the White House."" ""Don't be cowards and attack us with drones,"" he said. ""Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq. We will humiliate them everywhere."" Its actions give us no choice but to acknowledge that ISIS means what it says. Many people seem to be confused or deluded into believing that Hamas does not have similarly genocidal intentions. Its charter is a useful starting point. ""Israel will rise and will remain erect until Islam eliminates it as it had eliminated its predecessors,"" it says. What does ""eliminate"" mean, you might ask? More from the charter: . ""...[T]he Hamas has been looking forward to implement Allah's promise whatever time it might take. The prophet, prayer and peace be upon him, said: The time will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: O Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!"" As Americans and Europeans beg for cease-fires, it is useful to see Hamas' attitude toward such arrangements. From ""Article Thirteen: Peaceful Solutions, [Peace] Initiatives and International Conferences"": . ""[Peace] initiatives, the so-called peaceful solutions, and the international conferences to resolve the Palestinian problem, are all contrary to the beliefs of the Islamic Resistance Movement. For renouncing any part of Palestine means renouncing part of the religion...the movement educates its members to adhere to its principles and to raise the banner of Allah over their homeland as they fight their Jihad. ... ""There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad,"" it concludes. ""The initiatives, proposals and international conferences are but a waste of time, an exercise in futility. The Palestinian people are too noble to have their future, their right and their destiny submitted to a vain game."" Of course, the Charter of Hamas was written in 1988, so maybe they have mellowed? During this current struggle, while Westerners were begging the Israelis to be reasonable, an imam amplified Hamas' position in a public, televised sermon. ""Our doctrine in fighting you [the Jews] is that we will totally exterminate you. We will not leave a single one of you alive, because you are alien usurpers of the land and eternal mercenaries."" Obviously the organization exists for the same genocidal mission as ISIS. Boko Haram has its own contribution to this hateful movement. A spokesman for Boko Haram recently told a Nigerian newspaper that ""the Nigerian state and Christians are our enemies and we will be launching attacks on the Nigerian state and its security apparatus as well as churches until we achieve our goal of establishing an Islamic state in place of the secular state."" Boko Haram threatened its captured Christian girls with death or being sold into slavery if they didn't convert to Islam. ISIS is saying the same thing to the Yazidi girls they are capturing. The civilized world faces an existential challenge to its very right to exist. This violent, genocidal ideology holds more territory today than at any time in modern history. From Nigeria to Iraq, the challenge is being organized by sincere, serious fanatics motivated by religion and willing, indeed eager, to die for their cause. Western elites are terrified of confronting this reality. For years they have refused to take these people at their word, and millions of Iraqis, Syrians, Nigerians, Lebanese, Palestinians and Israelis, among many others, are paying the price. President Obama's speech Thursday night was a pathetic, shallow, sophistic excuse for a serious conversation with the American people. Americans are not ""war weary."" But even if we were, it would not matter. The alternative is the victory of genocidal murdering religious fanatics over enormous territory that they pledge to use to attack the United States. A president's job is to explain this. President Lincoln carried America through an extraordinarily painful civil war by telling the truth, admitting mistakes and reminding Americans what was at stake. The elites in both political parties have refused to confront how serious, brutal and determined our enemies are. The State Department is the second most dysfunctional federal department after the Veterans Administration because its culture and structure force it to mislead and misinform every president. Thirteen years after 9/11, at a cost of thousands of lives, tens of thousands of wounded, and trillions of dollars, the United States is weaker and our enemies are stronger. This is not an Obama problem. This is an American problem. We need a new honest conversation on how we as a free people are going to defeat the forces of evil who stalk the planet.

"(CNN) -- Richard Branson loves it, says Wubbo Ockels, former astronaut and creator of the super-fast, super-long Superbus. And he's not the only one. ""We've had interest from Las Vegas. We also had interest from Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the Netherlands,"" Ockels said. The 15 meter-long (50 feet) Superbus is a new spin on public transport that aims to match the speed and comfort of a train while offering the flexibility and convenience of the car. It has a top speed of 250 kph (155 mph) and Ockels envisions it running on a dedicated highway. But it's not just high-speed transport from A to B, Ockels says -- the Superbus can also use normal roads at normal speeds. What's more, it's powered by electricity, which was central to the vision of its chief designer Antonia Terzi. ""What inspired me was the concept that it was a sustainable, new type of transport,"" Terzi said. ""Public transport has to be exciting. You want to say 'well, I have a car but today I'm going to take the Superbus instead,'"" she added. A former Formula One aerodynamicist, Terzi has incorporated hydraulic cylinders in the design so that the car can sit just 7cm off the ground when traveling at high speed, rising to a height of 43cm when it uses normal roads in towns and cities. Rear-wheel steering helps the Superbus achieve a 24-meter turning circle, going easily around a roundabout, says Terzi. After taking a ride earlier this month, 61-year-old Branson commented on his blog that he thinks the Superbus could take on the train business one day, matching it for speed while trumping its convenience by dropping commuters off at their front door. Ockels says he wanted to create something sexy, and something that makes you feel powerful when you are inside, but most of all something that could compete with the car. He hopes to have the vehicle on the roads within five years.","Richard Branson takes a spin in prototype designed to transform commuting .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Indian-administered Kashmir witnessed widespread violence Monday that killed 18 people and left 80 wounded, some of them critically. Pro-independence mobs defied a round-the-clock curfew to stage protests against India and against a Florida pastor's now-canceled plans to burn the Quran, leading to fierce clashes with Indian security forces. Two Christian missionary schools, several government buildings and two police vehicles were set on fire by angry mobs, mostly young people, police said. The demonstrations to denounce the potential desecration of the Quran added a dimension to the three-month-long anti-India unrest. Monday's killings are the highest single-day toll in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley since June 11, bringing the death toll to 89. Scores of others wounded in the violence are receiving treatment in Kashmir hospitals that have come under tremendous strain. Clashes between Indian security forces and stone-throwing protesters raged in numerous towns across Kashmir, from the northern resort town of Tangmarg to the central Budgam district and Anantnag in the south. Local governments appealed for calm and banned the Iranian Press TV channel, which reported on the American pastor's plans to burn the Quran. The protests are part of a ""Quit Kashmir"" campaign launched by separatist groups against Indian rule in Kashmir. Muslim-majority Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan. India deployed thousands of troops in Kashmir to guard against what Indian leaders believe was a Pakistan-backed insurgency that began in the late 1980s. That insurgency, which India says claimed more than 43,000 lives, is no longer raging, but the troops have remained.","Protests against Indian control rage on, along with protests over Quran-burning plans .

"(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus is an addict. The ""drug"" she can't get enough of is potentially one of the most dangerous ones out there: Fame. I bet that Miley won't even be upset with me saying this about her. Why? Because her name is in the headline of this article. And on some level, I -- along with others in the media -- am enabling her addiction. But Miley is not the only person who craves fame. America is filled with people like Miley. Just watch any ""Real Housewives of_____,"" ""American Idol"" auditions, ""The X Factor,"" etc. Even I enjoy making appearances on cable TV. Of course, I don't appear on these shows like Cyrus, scantily clad with my tongue hanging out and twerking nonstop. (And I'm sure not many people would want to see me do that.) Miley may only be 20 years old, but she has mastered the game of manipulating the media to follow her every move. She did it in August at the MTV Music Awards when she dry-humped singer Robin Thicke. She followed it up in September with the release of her music video, ""Wrecking Ball,"" in which she appeared naked while swinging on a wrecking ball. And just this past weekend she lit up a marijuana joint and smoked it during MTV's European Awards telecast. Granted, the awards show was held in Amsterdam, where marijuana is legal. In fact, there's even a Museum of Marijuana over there. Would Miley have smoked pot on a U.S. TV show, in violation of the law? Maybe. In order for Miley to get her fame fix, she'll need to come up with more and more outrageous antics. There really is no incentive for Miley to change her ways. After all, she isn't doing it for the money -- her net worth is estimated to be $120-150 million. But rather, she would do it for the high of seeing her name in the headlines. At this point, there are a few paths Miley can take. She can follow the footsteps of fame junkies like Donald Trump and Sarah Palin and become nothing more than a walking punch line. She can sadly go down the trail of young stars whose lives tragically ended at an early age because fame -- or the loss of it -- was too painful to endure. Or -- and this is my sincere hope -- Miley can follow the lead of fame addicts who use their name recognition to call attention to pressing social or political issues and push for positive change. A good example of this type of person is Lady Gaga. Lady Gaga loves fame. The lyrics of her new hit song ""Applause"" makes this point abundantly clear. ""I live for the applause ... Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me."" We've seen Gaga wear a dress made of real meat and be carried to an awards show in a large egg pod. Just this week, at the release party for her new album, she wore a dress that had mini-helicopter-type rotors attached to it so she could fly around the room. But Lady Gaga has also used her fame for more than just self-promotion. This week while Miley Cyrus was smoking a joint on stage, Lady Gaga was opening up about her addiction to marijuana. She admitted that at one time she smoked 15-20 joints a day. She talked about her struggles in overcoming addiction. Gaga offered a sobering cautionary tale for young people that marijuana may turn out to be more than recreational fun -- it could consume your life. And for years, Lady Gaga has used her fame to sway public opinion on gay rights. She called on President Obama to support marriage equality years before he finally did. She also pushed for an end to the military's ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Of course, while she was advocating for changes she was getting plenty of media coverage. It's a win-win situation. So, Miley, twerk all you want, but in between your publicity binges, why not also talk about issues that demand more attention, such as domestic violence, child poverty, gun safety, etc.? Think of it as: ""Twerking for a cause."" Believe me, the press will love it and so will the people you are helping. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Like many stars, Miley Cyrus is addicted to fame .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Norbert lashed Mexico's west coast Saturday with strong winds and drenching rains, the latter of which triggered mudslides that cut off some communities. As of 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET), the storm had 100 mph sustained winds as it moved northwest at an 8 mph clip. The worst of it was not rolling over land -- centered, as it was, 180 miles west-northwest of Cabo San Lazaro -- meaning its winds haven't been as devastating as might have otherwise been the case. The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted that 3 to 6 inches will likely fall in the central and northern Baja California peninsula, with 10 inches possible in some spots. All that water has already caused dangerous mudslides and damage. ""There are no terrestrial communications"" in two communities in the Loreto municipality after landslides, said Baja California official Jose Luis Perpuly Drew, according to the Notimex state news agency. Local authorities working with army, navy and civil protection forces are moving to bring food and medical supplies to Ague Verde and San Cosme, said Drew. There are also efforts underway to rebuild a wall that serves as a key buffer in Comondu, Notimex reported. The storm also prompted the evacuation of more than 450 people from two hostels in Puerto San Carlos, according to the news agency. Hurricane Norbert is expected to cause large swells, dangerous surf and rip currents along Mexico's west coast through the Gulf of California, the National Hurricane Center said. There is some good news in all this, though: Norbert got weaker as Saturday wore along and that trend should continue, with the Miami-based hurricane center predicting it will become a tropical storm on Sunday.","NEW: state news: Over 450 people evacuated from 2 hostels .

"(CNN) -- Authorities closed the case Friday on Leanne Hecht Bearden, the once intrepid world traveler who was found dead a day earlier, after having apparently killed herself, according to police. According to Garden Ridge, Texas, Police Chief Donna O'Conner, ""Preliminary autopsy results indicate asphyxiation by hanging."" The apparent manner of death is suicide, she added, though a final ruling won't be released until toxicology results are in. Authorities announced Thursday that a body believed to be the 33-year-old woman had been found in Garden Ridge, where she was last seen January 17 heading out from her in-laws' house for what was supposed to be a one-hour walk. A man in that city northeast of San Antonio had called police after finding a body in a wooded area near his house. Family members later confirmed her death, saying on a Facebook page dedicated to finding her that they were ""understandably devastated."" ""Leanne was a lovely and remarkable young woman,"" the family said, ""and we will all miss her greatly."" An expansive intensive search commenced soon after Bearden was reported missing, while her relatives and friends hit the streets and airwaves to alert anyone they could about her case. But -- after having crisscrossed the globe for 22 months with her husband, Josh Bearden -- authorities now believe that she didn't go far, nor was it very long, before she died. According to O'Conner, investigators believe that Bearden died ""a short time after she was seen leaving (her in-law's) residence for a walk."" ""Our thoughts are with the Hecht and Bearden families as they grieve the loss of their loved one,"" the police chief said. ""There are no words to express our appreciation to all the citizens, law enforcement. agencies, Texas Search and Rescue and Heidi Search Center for their support."" Bearden went missing shortly after she and Josh -- who married at the Denver Zoo and joked they epitomized the adage ""opposites attract"" -- returned to the United States from their epic, global adventure. She documented their journeys to places like Mount Everest's base camp, the Dead Sea and South America's Patagonia extensively on a blog. Coming back to her native country wasn't necessarily easy, her family suggested. ""The pressure of transitioning from her two-year trip back into what we consider 'normal' life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed,"" they said. After she went missing, relatives and friends worked intently to spread the word as the search for her -- on the ground and from the air, using helicopters -- expanded. One such search in January covered 23 acres. Garden Ridge police noted their concern about Bearden that month, while adding ""there is no indication at this time that (her disappearance) is criminal in nature."" Her family, meanwhile, acknowledged on Facebook that ""there is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area."" Family: Strong possibility Bearden meant to leave .

"(CNN) -- Over the past week, two popular Internet messaging companies, SnapChat and Skype, were hacked. SnapChat's 4.6 million users' user names and cell phone numbers were posted online. A hacker group posted messages to Skype's official blog and social media accounts. These are just the latest in a long list of tech companies that fail to provide adequate protection of their users' personal data. Do companies that offer free services have an obligation to protect our communications? Yes, absolutely. SnapChat is an app for phones that allows people to send photos and short videos to friends and promises to delete them once viewed, Ã  la Mission Impossible. In August 2013, a group of security researchers publicly reported weaknesses in SnapChat's programming interfaces that could allow data exfiltration and manipulation. They withheld the specific details that would enable someone to easily exploit the flaws. If you're mad at your critics, you might ignore them and quietly fix the flaws. If you're appreciative you might engage them in a dialogue, thank them and work out some time to fix things before telling the public about it. But it seems the founders of SnapChat chose instead to stick their heads in the sand. After four months without response, the security researchers grew impatient and decided to publicly disclose the details on Christmas Day, including code they had written that would allow almost anyone to abuse SnapChat's service. SnapChat then blogged that it knew about the flaws, but was satisfied with the changes it implemented and didn't expect the service to be exploited. The next day someone posted the user names and phone numbers of the 4.6 million SnapChat users that they had extracted using the security weaknesses. While some can make excuses for SnapChat by saying the company is young, hence inexperienced, a breach is still a breach. Skype, a division of Microsoft, can't even say that. Skype had the dubious distinction of being the first major Internet company to be compromised in 2014. It is the latest victim of a group called the Syrian Electronic Army, which has targeted numerous media companies over the years, including The Financial Times, BBC, NPR, Associated Press and Reuters. With more than 3 million followers on Twitter and 27 million ""likes"" on its Facebook page, you would expect the security of a company like Skype to be carefully managed. How did this so-called electronic army penetrate its defenses? It must have been an extremely sophisticated hack, right? Unfortunately, the answer is no. The Syrian Electronic Army is famous for using phishing, a simple tool that persuades users to disclose their user names and passwords through cleverly worded e-mails. The primary defense against phishing, aside from never clicking suspicious links or attachments in e-mails, is to use two-factor authentication. The first factor is something we know, typically a password. By adding a second factor -- something you have such as a phone or special keychain token -- attackers not only must acquire your password, but also gain access to a piece of randomly generated information sent to a physical device. The social media accounts of Skype that were accessed by the Syrian Electronic Army had optional two-factor authentication available, but it was apparently not enabled by Skype. As a result, Skype's blog featured a headline: ""Hacked by Syrian Electronic Army ... Stop Spying!"" Similar messages were posted on its Twitter and Facebook pages. Skype acknowledged in a tweet: ""You may have noticed our social media properties were targeted today. No user info was compromised. We're sorry for the inconvenience."" But Snapchat's response to the incident is shameful. The company attempted to justify its mistake and promised it will change the app to allow opting-out of one feature without any acknowledgment of the damage done to its users or even a commitment to fixing the list of problems identified by the researchers. If this was 2012, I might be a little more forgiving. Back then most services didn't offer protections like two-factor authentication or those protections were not flexible enough to work for social media accounts. But this is 2014. All of these social media services offer protection free, designed to prevent this very type of attack. Didn't Skype think the 27 million people who ""liked"" them on Facebook and the more than 3 million people who follow them on Twitter deserve to be protected from potentially malicious posts? Companies that can't seem to get enough of our personal information need to be held accountable. The least they can do is be responsible and keep our data safe. The safeguards exist and the tech fixes are not hard. So, what are they waiting for? For consumers, don't become complacent to the barrage of announcements explaining how another 5 million records were stolen due to negligence. Demand accountability. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Twitter is giving users the bird. A cute, little, upwardly mobile bird. The social-networking company wants to be universally known by a new streamlined bird logo, replacing the scruffier bird that had symbolized Twitter since ... well, way back in 2010. ""Starting today you'll begin to notice a simplified Twitter bird,"" Twitter said in a blog post Wednesday. ""From now on, this bird will be the universally recognizable symbol of Twitter. (Twitter is the bird, the bird is Twitter.) There's no longer a need for text, bubbled typefaces, or a lowercase ""t"" to represent Twitter."" Twitter gave no reason for the refreshed bird, which is less chubby, has fewer feathers and is angled more towards the sky than its predecessor. But jokesters in the Twittersphere, where #twitterbird was trending Wednesday, were only too happy to offer some. ""About time we get a simplified #twitterbird That last one was so not 140 characters!"" wrote MeetZoe. ""Twitter is too young to be changing its logo.

He still looks delicious...nice, I mean nice."" And Adam McCombs may have spoken for many users when he tweeted, ""Maybe @twitter should spend more time working on performance instead of playing with their logo."" In its post, Twitter says the new bird is ""crafted purely from three sets of overlapping circles â€” similar to how your networks, interests and ideas connect and intersect with peers and friends."" In rather flowery rhetoric, the post goes on to say, ""Whether soaring high above the Earth to take in a broad view, or flocking with other birds to achieve a common purpose, a bird in flight is the ultimate representation of freedom, hope and limitless possibility.""

"(CNN) -- Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry is taking an indefinite leave of absence, the NBA team's chief executive announced Friday, days after a report surfaced about controversial comments Ferry made about a free agent player. Ferry made the remarks about Luol Deng during a June conference call about prospective players, according to a letter obtained by CNN affiliate WSB and audio of that call obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. J. Michael Gearon Jr., a minority owner of the Hawks, wrote the letter to team owner Bruce Levenson shortly after the conference call to complain about Ferry's language. In that letter, Gearon said Ferry -- in addition to positive statements about Deng -- described the now-Miami Heat forward as ""a two-faced liar and cheat"" who is ""like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back.'"" Gearon also stated that the Hawks GM said Deng ""has a little African him."" This sentiment is reflected in the audio of the call posted to the AJC's website, in which a man purported to be Ferry describes Deng as ""a good guy overall, but he's not perfect. He's got some African in him."" He says that Deng ""was very worried about his bobblehead being the last one given away that year, or that there's not enough stuff on him in the team store."" Hawks general manager accused of racist comments . Ferry apologized for the comments in a statement Tuesday, describing them as ""insensitive remarks."" Then, Friday afternoon, he requested ""an indefinite leave of absence, effective immediately,"" Hawks CEO Steve Koonin said in a statement. ""It is my hope that this time away from the Hawks organization allows him the privacy he needs to listen to the community, to learn about his mistakes, and to begin the long process of personal healing,"" Koonin said. ""As a human being, manager and friend, I wish him well as he undergoes this process."" Ferry released his own statement Friday, reiterating his apology to Deng and ""all that I have offended."" He said ""these were not my words"" but ""I deeply regret repeating them."" He did not address specifics of the conference call. The former NBA player-turned-executive has said he was reading from scouting materials provided to him. CNN obtained a copy of such a scouting report on Friday. It contained elements of Ferry's remarks on that June conference call, but it was not word-for-word of what he said. In his latest statement, Ferry said he plans to meet with community leaders to ""further educate myself and others on the extremely sensitive issues surrounding race, diversity and inclusion."" ""My focus moving forward is to tirelessly work to rebuild trust with this community and with our fans,"" said Ferry. ""... I will find a way to make a positive difference in this area, and further learn from the sensitivity training that I will go through."" Follows a report about other racially charged remarks . The WSB report came days after Levenson announced he would sell his stake in the franchise following the release of a racially charged email he wrote in 2012. The email was found by an outside law firm brought in to review the Hawks franchise following Ferry's comments in June. The comments had spurred concern within the organization, especially given the uproar over former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling's racial remarks. In the email, which was sent to Ferry, Levenson described the franchise's difficulties in attracting more affluent white season-ticket holders. The email -- one of 24,000 pieces of evidence looked at as part of the outside investigation, according to Koonin -- bemoaned the high number of black cheerleaders and said that white fans may have been scared away by black fans. Hawks owner to sell team after racially charged email . ""Bruce was confronted with this email from 2012,"" Koonin told CNN's Martin Savidge, ""and he decided that instead of fighting it ... he thought it was best for the city, for the team, for his family, to walk away."" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who brought the hammer down to force out Sterling as the Clippers owner, called Levenson's 2012 email ""entirely unacceptable"" and commended Levenson for self-reporting to the league office. Silver said the league will work with the Hawks to determine the appropriate sale process for the team. As to Ferry, the commissioner told USA Today this week that he didn't believe the Hawks general manager should be fired for his June comments. ""Understanding ... the fact that he was looking at the scouting report as a reference when he was making these remarks -- ... my opinion is that this is a team decision in terms of what the appropriate discipline is for their employee,"" Silver told the newspaper. ""But if I'm being asked my view, I'm saying that, based on what I know about the circumstances, I don't think it's a terminable offense."" Not everyone agrees. NBA great Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, for example, tweeted Tuesday that Ferry should step down for his comments. ""The city of Atlanta and the Hawks fans deserve and should demand better from the Hawks leadership,"" said Johnson, who had a significant, albeit indirect role in the Sterling saga and was among those who pushed hard for the then-Clippers owner's ouster.

"(CNN) -- He's used to holding trophies aloft on Sundays but all Tiger Woods is clutching at the moment is his back. For the second week running the world No. 1 has been beaten by back spasms, sparking concern over his ability to mount a serious challenge at the Masters which gets underway on April 10. After pulling out during the final round of the Honda Classic at PGA National, Woods challenge at the WGC Cadillac Championship was blunted by spasms which started after hitting a ball from an awkward stance in fairway bunker at the par four sixth at Doral's Blue Monster course. ""That's what set it off and then it was done after that,"" Woods said following a frustrating round, PGATour.com reported. ""Just (tried to) see if I could actually manage through to keep the spasms at bay. But anything in the flexion was done, so the deeper the flexion, the worse it felt."" Woods ended up posting a six-over par 78 to finish tied for 25th after playing his way back in contention for the lead with a superb round of 66 on Saturday. ""If I feel good, I can actually make a pretty decent swing,"" Woods said. ""You saw it (on Saturday). But if I'm feeling like this, it's a little tough."" Read more: Reed re-writes WGC history . Woods has endured a string of injuries in recent years including ligament damage in his left knee and a ruptured Achilles tendon in his right ankle. His current back problems first emerged during the final round of The Barclays tournament last August -- a complaint he put down to a soft mattress in a hotel room. The 14-time major champion now has 10 days off before his next scheduled event -- the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in Orlando, Florida which starts on March 20. ""If it flares up, it flares up,"" Woods said. ""It's just a matter of keeping it calm, and we had a quick turnaround here from last week. It would be nice to have a week off where I can shut it down and get some treatment."" Twelve months ago, Woods won the tournament to regain the world No. 1 spot before heading onto Augusta where he finished tied for fourth for the third time in four seasons. He will not need reminding that he last won the Masters way back in 2005 and hasn't won a major of any description since the U.S. Open in 2008. As the 38-year-old noted in January, time may not be on his side, but his desire remains undimmed. ""Looking back from the beginning of my career to now, I know that I don't have 20 years in my prime,"" Woods said. ""I don't see being 58 and being in my prime. Most guys don't jump from the foul line at age 58, so it's a little different but the outlook is still the same. ""I still prepare the same, I still work my tail off to be ready to compete at this level and beat everything that I'm playing against.""","Tiger Woods struggles with back spasms for second consecutive tournament .

"(CNN) -- More than $60,000 worth of computers, jewelry and personal items have been stolen from the Palo Alto, California, home of the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Kariem McFarlin, 35, of Alameda was arrested and charged with residential burglary and selling stolen property, according to Scott Tsui, supervising deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County. McFarlin remains in the Santa Clara County jail on $500,000 bail pending a court hearing on Monday, Tsui said. The break-in occurred July 17, although details of the burglary and McFarlin's August 2 arrest are now just becoming public. The house was being renovated last month, and nobody was home at the time, Tsui said. Report: iPhone 5 to go on sale September 21 . The prosecutor said McFarlin was likely unaware of the home's significance. ""It appears to be a random deal,"" he told CNN. ""We don't have anything to show that (Jobs' family) was targeted."" Tsui declined to provide details about exactly what was taken from the house. But a report in the San Jose Mercury News says that the burglar made off with iPads, iPhones, Macs, Tiffany jewelry, Beats headphones and Cristal Champagne, among other items. He also took Steve Jobs' wallet, which contained his drivers' license and $1, the Mercury News reported. Police tracked McFarlin down through the use of the stolen computer equipment, Tsui said. He declined to provide more specifics. McFarlin, a former San Jose State football player, could face a maximum prison sentence of seven years and eight months. He has confessed and has written a letter of apology to Steve Jobs' widow, Laurene Powell, the Mercury News reported.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Tuesday Congress should ""use all means necessary"" to prevent President Barack Obama from granting what Cruz considers amnesty to more immigrants who are in the country illegally. He said it would be ""appropriate"" to include a provision that would block the President from doing so in a critical government-funding bill that Congress must approve this month. Democrats immediately seized on the issue and charged that Cruz wants to shut down the government by attaching a ""poison pill"" to the funding bill, which is known as a continuing resolution or CR. Cruz was at the center of last year's government shutdown, which Democrats believe did long term damage to the GOP. ""It's another Ted Cruz hostage situation. Last October he held the entire federal government hostage to his ideology and now he's willing to do it again,"" the chairman of the House Democrats' campaign arm, Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York told CNN. Despite Cruz's tough talk, there appears to be no appetite even among some of the House conservatives who pushed for a confrontation last fall to have a fight on the spending bill this close to the election. In the Senate, GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said he wouldn't allow another shutdown to happen. Still, Israel maintained, ""it's deja vu all over again. In October as they were shutting down the government, they said they wouldn't shut down the government. They just can't be trusted."" House Republicans are expected to vote Thursday on a bill to extend current government-funding levels through December 11. At issue are GOP concerns the President will expand his use of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which conservatives consider amnesty. That's because earlier this summer the President vowed to use executive authority to take a number of steps related to immigration since Congress was gridlocked on the issue. The President has since said he won't take any unilateral action until after the midterm election. 5 reasons Obama's delay on immigration is political . But Cruz said Tuesday Republicans should use ""every tool at our disposal"" including the CR. ""I think we should use any and all means necessary to prevent the President from illegally granting amnesty. That certainly, I think, would be appropriate to include in the CR,"" Cruz said at a news conference. ""But I think we should use every -- every -- tool at our disposal."" Cruz declined to say if he would vote against the CR unless the provision is in the bill. ""Let's wait to see what's in the CR,"" Cruz said. ""I have a habit of waiting to see what's in legislation before I make a decision about whether I will support it or not."" How far can the President go on executive actions?","Cruz says ""any and all means necessary"" should be used to stop ""illegally granting amnesty""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's military announced Thursday that it has taken control of the government. Here's what that means for travelers visiting one of Asia's most popular tourist destinations. The biggest implication of the coup -- declared after rival factions were unable to come up with a suitable agreement to govern -- is the nationwide curfew, in effect from 10 p.m.-5 a.m. until further notice. However, the military said air passengers with arrival and departure flights scheduled during the curfew are permitted to travel to and from the airports at any time, and are advised to carry a printout of their flight itinerary. All airports in Thailand remain open and flights are still operating as scheduled. On the ground in Bangkok and beyond . On the ground in Bangkok on Friday morning, streets are calm and most residents are carrying on with their lives as normal, though military checkpoints have been set up at various locations throughout the country. Since the coup announcement was made, protest groups on both sides have dismantled their camps in line with the army's ban on gatherings of five people or more. The military announced a nationwide closure of schools until Sunday, though some international schools remained open. All foreigners, regardless of whether they are tourists or residents, are advised to carry their passports with them at all times. Tourist attractions, government offices, embassies, shops, restaurants and malls are still open, though some have adjusted their hours in line with the curfew. All Bangkok expressways currently remain open. The city's BTS Skytrain, MRT subway, Suvarnabhumi Airport Rail Link, public ferries and trains continue to operate, though hours have been adjusted in line with the curfew. Taxis were reportedly available at both airports for passengers arriving after the curfew, though travelers posting on social media reported experiencing longer lines than usual. All popular tourist destinations outside of Bangkok, including Phuket, Chiang Mai and Krabi, are all operating as normal and there is a limited military presence on the streets, according to reports, though popular night spots closed early on Thursday night due to the curfew. Television and social media . All state-run, satellite and cable TV providers have been ordered to carry only the signal of the army's television channel. CNN is among those networks that have been taken off the air. In an announcement on their Facebook page, the military government announced that Thai citizens should not believe rumors that they will shut down the internet, social media or Youtube. Though there are reports the military is monitoring social media and will block any content perceived as a threat to national security, as of Friday morning all websites and apps were working normally. With TV stations now off the air, Twitter is one of the best ways to get real-time information on the situation in Bangkok. Richard Barrow, a full-time travel blogger based in Bangkok, is a top source for those seeking news about the protests as well as travel advice. He can be followed at Twitter.com/richardbarrow. Local English-language media on Twitter include the Bangkok Post: Twitter.com/BPbreakingnews; The Nation: Twitter.com/nationnews; and MCOT: Twitter.com/MCOT_Eng. Government warnings . Tourists are advised to check with their governments before traveling to Thailand, as warnings vary and can impact the validity of their travel insurance. In a statement following the coup announcement, the United States Embassy in Bangkok issued an emergency message. ""U.S. citizens are advised to stay alert, exercise caution, and monitor media coverage,"" it said. ""You are advised to avoid areas where there are protest events, large gatherings, or security operations and follow the instructions of Thai authorities. "" In response to the coup, the Hong Kong government raised its Outbound Travel Alert for Thailand to red, indicating it feels residents face a significant threat by visiting. ""Residents intending to visit Thailand should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel, including leisure travel,"" says the statement. ""Those already there should monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety and avoid protests and large gatherings of people."" Tourist hotlines .

"(CNN) -- A Korean woman receives death threats because she wouldn't clean up her dog's mess on the subway; a Chinese man suspected of philandering is besieged by angry emails and phone calls; an American college student caught plagiarizing online is turned in by incensed bloggers. A zombie 'flesh mob' hits the streets of London, England . Forget Big Brother, it's the Internet mob that's watching you... It's a long time since the Internet was populated purely by geeks and freaks. Our personas in virtual space are increasingly integrated with our ""real life"" identities; a growing number of people have Facebook profiles, blogs and Flickr accounts. And our physical and virtual worlds are meshing, too. ""Flash mobbing"" is one of the Internet's stranger crazes. Groups of people organized by Web sites, email and text message descend on public spaces to take part in bizarre demonstrations of performance art. The first Flash mob took place at Macy's in New York City in June 2003 when over a hundred people converged in the rug department. The phenomenon has spread to flash parties on subway trains and silent flash raves in train stations in Great Britain; flash pillow fights in Toronto; zombie flash mobs in San Francisco; and a flash proposal of marriage to one girl in Beijing. Flash mobbing is seen at worst as a nuisance that can delay commuters and other travelers who encounter mobs in action. But groups of people have been harnessed via the Internet for purposes other than entertainment -- and one of these phenomena, known as ""mobbing,"" is more sinister. In 2005, a woman known as ""Dog Poop Girl"" became the victim of an Internet shame attack when, after refusing to clean up after her dog on a South Korean subway train, another commuter posted her picture on the Internet. She was quickly identified, her personal details were posted online, she was subjected to harassment and she even received death threats. In a recent article for TIME magazine, web guru Jaron Lanier wrote, ""Collectives tend to be mean, to designate official enemies, to be violent, and to discourage creative, rigorous thought... We might be genetically wired to be vulnerable to the lure of the mob."" And Lanier thinks it could go further. ""What's to stop an online mass of anonymous but connected people from suddenly turning into a mean mob, just like masses of people have time and time again in the history of every human culture?"" Some say it's already happening. Internet mobbing is most prevalent in South East Asian countries, where social norms are strict yet perceived as under threat. People are targeted when they are thought to have deviated from those norms. Along with Dog Poop Girl, vigilantes have pursued other targets with menacing enthusiasm. It took just five days in 2006 for vigilantes to track down the ""Stiletto Kitten Killer"" -- a Chinese woman who was videoed crushing a kitten's skull with her high-heeled shoe. Both she and the man who filmed her had their personal and contact information posted across the Internet, along with Internet ""Wanted"" posters. They lost their jobs and had to issue public apologies, a stern punishment in a country where animal protection laws do not exist. The same year, a manhunt was on to catch the ""Shanghai Sex Blogger"", a Western expat who detailed his dalliances with numerous Chinese women. Chinese bloggers raged against him. One, a professor of psychology at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, called for an ""Internet hunt for the immoral foreigner"" and called repeatedly for the man to be ""found and kicked out of China!!!"" In another well-known Chinese case, an angry husband who suspected his wife was having an affair with a college student she'd met in an online game asked for help tracking him down. The Associated Press reported that the student, who denied the accusation, was bombarded with harassing and threatening e-mails. This vigilante action might be prompted by understandable moral outrage, but some are concerned that the headline-grabbing witch-hunts have been vastly out of proportion with the original transgressions. Vigilantes have not stopped at reprimanding their quarry: They have shamed them publicly in front of thousands of people; their identities and personal details have been posted for all to see, making them vulnerable to fraud and identity theft; they and their families have been harassed. A director at South Korea's Ministry of Information and Communications, Oh Sang Kyoon told the International Herald Tribune, ""Victims cannot live a normal life. They quit jobs and run away from society. They even flee the country. It's like lynching victims in a 'people's court on the Web.'"" It's hard not to feel sympathy for some targets of mobbing. An American college student known as ""Laura K. Krishna"" (not her real name) was caught out when she offered a stranger $75 via instant messenger to write a paper for her. Unfortunately for her, the person she approached, comedy writer and blogger Nate Kushner, accepted her offer and blogged about it, hoping to teach the plagiarist a lesson. But the story was seized by enraged bloggers and quickly span out of control: They flooded her home and college with emails and phone calls, demanding she be kicked out of school. Laura K. Krishna quickly became the butt of McJob jokes and her long-term employment prospects suffered (ask any employer who Googles a potential recruit before hiring; her real name is still easily obtainable online). There's no doubt that plagiarism is wrong, but was the punishment meted out to her appropriate for her crime? A commenter posting as ""Joanna"" thinks not. She wrote on Nate Kushner's blog, ""I felt slightly sick when I read that, apparently, a fair number of people on this thread want to see 'Ms. Krishna' expelled, publicly flayed, drawn and quartered, et cetera. ""As a college student working my a** off for an English degree, I have no respect for this girl ... but she is, above all, just a stupid kid who did a stupid thing."" Once they're targeted, there's little that people can do to remove details about them online. Information travels fast and can be replicated with ease. Nate Kushner removed Laura K. Krishna's name and college from his site at the request of her mother, but her details remain on other sites. It would take remarkable concerted effort -- and co-operation from Web site owners -- to expunge her information from the Internet. This is partly because the Internet is not regulated by any one set of laws. It transcends national boundaries, and makes recourse to legal avenues complicated, expensive and questionably effective, as Brazilian model Daniela Cicarelli found when she tried to use the law to remove YouTube videos of her romping in the sea with her banker boyfriend. As fast as YouTube took down the videos, they were re-posted, while the press coverage of the lawsuit simply sparked more interest in the footage, plus a whole host of spoof tributes. The most concerning aspect of mobbing, though, is the way large groups of people can be mobilized to attack a perceived transgressor without their accusers providing any real evidence of their guilt. On the Internet, the mob can be judge and jury. One American blogger, Jason, has touted the use of mobbing as a tool to hold public officials accountable for their actions. ""Isn't the threat of hundreds of people calling you during dinner to tell you what a jerk you are seem like it would make you tone it down a bit?"" he wrote. ""When I see an infuriating story crop up on Digg, I'm going to dig for personal information about the offenders and post it to the comments,"" he continued. But while Jason's intentions might be to protect the public, can mob rule be a viable option for any society? Some argue that virtual lynchings will only turn transgressors into victims. Even online, as the saying goes, two wrongs don't make a right. In the meantime, those thinking of the Internet as an idyllic place for freedom of expression would be wise to take heed: say what you like, but remember that the mob is watching you... .......................................

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police have arrested three suspects in the kidnapping of Warren Weinstein, a development expert from the United States who was snatched this month from his home in Lahore, Pakistan, a police official said Tuesday. The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad said she was not aware of any arrests. Weinstein was abducted August 13 when gunmen, posing as neighbors offering food, pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said. Weinstein works for J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, a Pakistani official said. He is a world-renowned development expert, with 25 years of experience, according to his company's website. The site says he was heading what the company described as the ""Pakistan Initiative for Strategic Development and Competitiveness."" As Weinstein's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month, according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain. Once the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in, while five other suspects entered the house from the back, Hussain said. The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said. They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room where the men hit Weinstein in the head with a pistol, and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, Hussain said. He said Weinstein is in his 60s.","Gunmen abducted Warren Weinstein from his home in Lahore, Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- It started out as a lovely summer night in northern California: an outdoor concert at a winery that's set among redwoods and that bills itself as ""miles away but worlds apart."" But Thursday's show by the band The Swell Season at the Mountain Winery, just outside San Jose, turned tragic when a concertgoer leapt from the roof of the stage, landed near the lead singer and died, in what authorities say was a suicide. ""Upon arriving, deputies found a doctor and an EMT on the scene, performing CPR on the victim,"" said Rick Sung, public information officer for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. ""They did that for almost half an hour when the doctor pronounced the victim dead."" The suicide victim, Michael Edward Pickels, 32, had attended the concert with a friend, Sung said. ""During the performance, the victim left his personal items behind with his friend,"" Sung said. ""The next thing (witnesses) see is the victim appears on the rooftop out of nowhere and throws himself off."" The roof was about 35 to 40 feet above the stage, Sung said. The doctor who pronounced Pickels dead had been attending the concert. Authorities said Saturday that Pickels had been out of jail on $150,000 bail after threatening to kill his girlfriend and himself on New Year's Day. Pickels had been charged with assault with a firearm, domestic violence and false imprisonment, Sung said. Pickels had bound his girlfriend, aimed a loaded gun at her, and said he was going to kill them both, according to Sung. The girlfriend talked him out of it, Sung said, then fled and phoned the sheriff's office. When deputies arrived at Pickels' house, he refused to come out for 90 minutes before surrendering. Pickels' death was ruled a suicide by Santa Clara County's coroner Friday, Sung said. The Mountain Winery relies on Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies to patrol its parking lot and concessions area during concerts, Sung said, but provides its own security for the stage and audience area. The winery, located in Saratoga, did not immediately return a call for comment Saturday night, though it addressed the incident in a brief message on its web site. ""Thank you to all of you [who] have inquired about the unfortunate incident that occurred here on Thursday evening,"" the message said. ""While we are working with local authorities in investigating this incident, there will be no changes to our concert schedule."" The Swell Season, a pop/rock duo, has reflected on the incident on its web site and social networking sites. ""The band, crew and all involved with them are shocked and saddened by the death that occurred at last night's show,"" the songwriting duo said on its Twitter page Friday. The Swell Season posted another message on its Facebook page Saturday before a concert in Washington state. ""Making and performing music is what the band has always done in good times and in bad,"" it read. ""Our hope is that in this communal experience tonight we can somehow help our own grieving process after what we just witnessed. The show will most certainly be different than any other we have ever played."" ""We wish to continue to be sensitive to family and friends of this individual and hope that in performing it is not viewed as a selfish act,"" the message continues. ""We have not come to this decision lightly. We continue to have them at the forefront of our minds and hearts.?"" CNN's Dan Gilgoff contributed to this report.","A concertgoer leapt from the roof of a stage at a winery concert .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- The prosecution and defense have made their cases, and now Judge Thokozile Masipa must decide: Did Oscar Pistorius intentionally kill his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp? Was it murder? The verdict is expected September 11. The judge has to answer several questions to reach her verdict on the murder charge, one of four charges Pistorius faces. First -- and most important -- did Pistorius know Steenkamp was behind the door in his bathroom when he fired four shots through it on Valentine's Day last year, killing her? If the answer is yes, beyond a reasonable doubt, Pistorius knew he was shooting at his girlfriend, then the judge will find him guilty of murder. Later, she'll have to decide whether it was premeditated. If she thinks it was, he could be sentenced to life in prison. In South Africa that means he'll have to serve at least 25 years. If she thinks the murder wasn't premeditated, Pistorius could get a minimum of 15 years behind bars. But if Masipa is not convinced that Pistorius knew Steenkamp was behind the door -- if there is any reasonable doubt of that -- he will not be convicted of murder. Pistorius argues he made a mistake -- that he thought was trying to defend himself from an intruder. If Masipa accepts that as plausible, she will then have to decide if his mistake and his actions were reasonable. If she says they were not, she'll find him guilty of a crime called culpable homicide. There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law -- Masipa will decide the punishment herself, taking South African precedent into account. And there's one final possibility. If the judge does not think the prosecution has proved its case -- if she believes there is a reasonable chance Pistorius made a reasonable mistake and responded reasonably -- she will find him not guilty, and Oscar Pistorius could be a free man. Masipa will make her decision with the assistance of two experts known as assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. Lesser charges . Pistorius faces three other weapons charges in addition to the murder accusation. Two charges are related to allegations that he recklessly fired a gun in public -- once in a restaurant in 2012, and once out of the sunroof of a car in 2013. Pistorius denies both. The maximum penalty for each charge is five years behind bars. If he is convicted of either, he could face a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. The final charge is that Pistorius was found to have ammunition without a proper license when police searched his home after he killed Steenkamp. Pistorius says he was storing the ammunition in his safe for his father. The charge is potentially a very serious one. If he is found guilty, he could face up to 15 years in prison, though Masipa could opt for a lesser punishment such as a fine or the loss of his gun license.

"(CNN) -- Manila's Payatas dump site is more than a simple landfill, it's an entire human eco-system. Located to the northeast of the Philippines' capital, it supports a population of almost half a million people many of whom eke out a precarious living sifting through garbage. Over the decades, an informal cottage industry grew up around women who earned money weaving recycled scrap fabric into rugs --- a job that allowed them to earn at least some money while they took care of their children at home. Their work came to the attention of middlemen who exploited them by controlling the supply of fabric as well as their access to the market. Eventually, many of the women were driven down below cost, producing the rugs for as little as 20 cents a day. In 2007, a group of young professionals came together to change the situation. Rags2Riches was set up to provide the women artisans of Payatas with a fair price and access to the formal market. With the help of some of the Philippines' top designers, including sought-after names such as Rajo Laurel, Amina Aranaz-Alunan, Olivia d'Aboville and Oliver Tolentino, the company began producing high-end fashion accessories made by the women of Patayas and other communities around the Philippines. According to Rags2Riches president Reese Fernandez-Ruiz, in a short six years the company has built an international brand with a growing reputation. ""We are starting to sell to retailers like Anthropologie and our partnerships are just going to expand,"" she said. ""We're doing our next fundraising within weeks and we'll be getting new investors in."" The company has so far trained more than 800 artisans producing everything from handbags, wallets and even wine bottle covers that retail in fashion houses as far away as London and New York. It now operates in 21 different communities around Metro Manila and has expanded to other parts of the Philippines taking in designs and work from poor communities across the country. Creating chances for a better future . The company aims not just to pay its workers better but to provide financial, educational and health training that it says will pay dividends into the future. Fernandez-Ruiz stresses that the materials that go into the products are no longer sourced from the garbage dump -- the scene of a tragic landslip in 2000 that killed more than 200 people -- but come straight from textile manufacturers before they are dumped. As for taking on the middlemen, she says there was such little cohesion among them that simple market forces broke their grip on the trade. Rags2Riches, she says, pays an average of 400-700 pesos a day ($9-$16) to its artisans, making it an easy choice for women that once earned as little as 20 cents for every rug they made. ""Funnily enough the middlemen made up a very informal group and a lot of middlemen didn't know that there were a string of middlemen involved in the operation,"" she said. ""Some of them thought they were alone in this and some of them are actually artisans now,"" she said. ""It wasn't really a gangster scene but it was more a group of people who really weren't aware of the opportunities that they had. ""When they had information, it allowed them to make better decisions. By coming into the picture, we provide them with that avenue."" Fernandez-Ruiz said the artisans are more than simply employees, and are integral to the operation of the company. ""They have a voice here. They provide us with their feedback and input -- they are part of our management team and part of our board as well."" Building a business . While the rag-pickers of Patayas had always made woven material to a high standard, she said that taking the products to the next level to allow them to be sold in international fashion houses had been an education for the artisans and the managers at Rags2Riches. ""While quality might be an objective thing for people who know what that means, for people who have other things to think about like what their kids will eat, the idea of quality can seem very trivial. ""We had to expose them to the market and understand how it works and why it has to work that way. ""It took a while and it was a process but there's a very strong understanding of how the market works now and the artisans influence it themselves."" In the often ego-driven world of high fashion -- where a designer's name drives the success of the brand -- Rags2Riches is turning many of the commonly held assumptions about brand success on their head. ""Artisans come to us with their designs all the time,"" Fernandez-Ruiz said, adding that individual artisans put their name to every product. ""We have a practice of collaborative design so it's not just one person calling the shots. ""One person will know how one particular part of a bag works and another person will know another part. ""We've found that if it's not collaborative, it's not as effective."" Read more: Some Philippines children swim to school, but now their lives could change .

"(CNN) -- Peace came to Europe on Monday, in the form of a golden medal. Leaders of the European Union accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on Monday, calling their organization a ""perpetual peace congress"" that had solved the problem of war on the continent. The Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the 8 million kronor ($1.2 million) prize to the European Union in October for what it called more than ""six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe."" European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Parliament President Martin Schulz traveled to Norway to accept the award, including the emblematic golden medal depicting prize founder Alfred Nobel in a ceremony at the ornate City Hall in Oslo, Norway. ""Our continent bears the scars of spears and swords, of cannons and guns, of trenches and tanks and more,"" Van Rompuy said. ""What a bold bet it was for Europe's founders to say yes, yes we can, yes we can break this endless cycle of violence, we can stop the logic of vengeance, we can build a brighter future together."" Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel Committee, said the award was well-deserved. ""What this continent has achieved is truly fantastic, from being a continent of war to becoming a continent of peace,"" he said. ""In this process, the European Union has figured most prominently. It therefore deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. The award was not without controversy. Three Nobel laureates -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mairead Maguire and Adolfo Perez Esquivel -- said the European Union doesn't qualify for the award and asked the prize board to withhold it. ""The EU is not seeking to realize NobelÂ´s demilitarized global peace order,"" the laureates wrote in a November letter. In his acceptance speech, Van Rompuy seemed to sharply disagree, saying that the European Union has transformed the continent from a land of war to one in which the greater threat is glazing over during the organization's myriad policy debates. ""For this, boring politics is only a small price to pay,"" he said. Barroso said the EU's influence and focus on human dignity and freedom are felt worldwide. ""As a community of nations that has overcome war and fought totalitarianism, we will always stand by those who are in pursuit of peace and human dignity,"" he said. The EU will use the prize money -- doubling it with its own contributions -- to help protect and educate children in conflict zones.","European Union has helped transform the continent, Nobel Committee chairman says .

"(CNN) -- Think back to the age before GoldieBlox, before gender-neutral Easy-Bake ovens, before ""My Princess Boy"" or ""It Gets Better"" or ""Lean In."" Way before apps for infants or TV networks for toddlers, in the days when ""Schoolhouse Rock"" was in its infancy. That'd bring you to the early 1970s, when an album in a bright pink sleeve was passed among teachers, parents, librarians and kids. It was called ""Free to Be... You and Me,"" and record players around the country spun songs such as ""William's Doll,"" ""Parents are People"" and ""It's All Right to Cry."" When it debuted in 1972, there was nothing else like it -- at least, nothing so popular. It was feminist and multicultural; an early childhood education in empathy; multimedia before anybody used the word. There was the gold record album, a best-selling book and in 1974, an Emmy- and Peabody-winning TV special that starred its creator, Marlo Thomas, ""and friends"" -- literally, her formidable list of famous pals, including Harry Belafonte, Alan Alda, Diana Ross, Roberta Flack, Carl Reiner, Rosey Grier and a young Michael Jackson. More than 40 years later, there's nostalgia in its opening chords and a legacy that still courses through classrooms. ""Children memorized every lyric and asked their parents and teacher to play the record over and over again,"" Letty Cottin Pogrebin, a Ms. magazine co-founder, wrote in the 2012 book ""When We Were Free to Be: Looking Back at a Children's Classic and the Difference It Made."" ""It challenged teachers to face up to their entrenched, often unacknowledged, gender biases and to cast a more critical eye on the books they were assigning, whom they called on most often in class, whom they allowed to dominate the block corner or the dress-up box."" The idea began with Thomas, star of the sitcom ""That Girl,"" and, in 1971, a new auntie. Her young niece's storybooks were the same ones Thomas had read as a kid, and recent entries to the bedtime canon reinforced that boys were pilots and doctors while girls were stewardesses and nurses. With the help of her friends and contacts, including poet Shel Silverstein and co-producer Carole Hart, the album and book were born. ""Honestly I was just trying to do something for one little girl,"" Thomas wrote in ""When We Were Free to Be."" ""That it would grow to become a cultural phenomenon was never a part of the plan."" ""Free to Be"" was revolutionary for its kid-savvy and reach, but it wasn't universally beloved. For every ""Free to Be"" class play, another school wouldn't acknowledge it. TV producers initially balked at a song that seemed to show Thomas and Belafonte as an interracial couple. At least one TV critic warned parents to keep kids away from the television when ""Free to Be"" was on. Focus on the Family founder James Dobson criticized it and advocated for traditional gender roles in child-rearing. Even its supporters argued that some of the skits were classist, and noted its bent toward traditional families with mommies, daddies and children. But its overall message lined up with shifting attitudes of the time, said Lori Rotskoff, a cultural historian and co-editor of ""When We Were Free to Be."" In the same year the ""Free to Be"" album debuted, President Richard Nixon signed Title IX, Ms. magazine began regular publication and TV's ""Maude"" had an abortion, just months before Roe v. Wade was decided. ""There's something distinct about the cultural moment it was produced,"" Rotskoff said. ""(Free to Be) retained so much of that progressive, oppositional challenging the norm, and it did so in a way that made it palatable."" It fit into changing classrooms, too. Educator Barbara Sprung spent part of the 1970s creating a nonsexist, multicultural curriculum for preschoolers, she wrote in ""When We Were Free to Be."" It meant posters and toys that showed women as construction workers and African-Americans as doctors -- materials she sometimes had to create on her own. She instructed educators to run with girls on the playground, to play dolls with boys and to be mindful of messages in books and music. ""As happens in every movement, backsliding occurred,"" Sprung wrote, noting that plenty of toys were still sexualized, violent and color-coded by gender. ""Fortunately, classroom materials and children's trade books continued to depict an increasingly nonsexist, multiracial and inclusive view of the world."" As a kid on Long Island in the 1970s, Miriam Peskowitz was a frustrated ""Free to Be"" fan. She wrote in ""When We Were Free to Be"" about her feminist mom's righteous letters and calls demanding her daughter be able take wood and mechanical shop, or that girls need not wait for boys to ask them to square dance. (Square dancing, of course, being one way that schools satisfied Title IX requirements.) To Peskowitz's dismay, she had the same arguments at her child's school decades later. Peskowitz watched in the mornings as her daughter settled down to draw bubble letters with her gal pals while boys raced each other to the chessboards. The teacher said it wasn't a problem; it's just what the kids chose. ""After I nudged again and again, the teacher eventually taught all the children in the classroom how to play chess. Some girls started to choose that as their morning activity,"" wrote Peskowitz, the author of ""The Daring Book for Girls."" ""Very often,"" Peskowitz wrote, ""all it takes to outsmart gender stereotypes is a little creative thinking and a little gumption. ""When we speak about feminism to adults, we tend to talk about negatives and things gone wrong. ... 'Free to Be's' cheeriness still has the power to make our hearts sing. It's a kind of feminism and a gender vision that is generous and likable and fun, all the things that feminism is usually accused of lacking."" But it hasn't necessarily gotten easier to talk about gender roles in school, said Laura Lovett, an associate professor of history at the University of Massachusetts and co-editor of ""When We Were Free to Be."" ""I talk to a lot of teachers now who say they couldn't show some of these things today,"" Lovett said. ""There's an anxiety about discussing something that might be seen as homosexual; there's anxiety about the school mentioning something that would be seen as negative or positive."" Most educators-in-training are too young to remember the heyday of ""Free to Be,"" Lovett said, and they wouldn't recognize a world where girls don't have access to sports and bullying is encouraged. Ideas that seemed so new in ""Free to Be... You and Me"" now turn up every day in ""Dora the Explorer,"" ""Brave"" and long shelves of picture books. When Lovett plays the music for college students now, she'll sometimes see nods and smiles from those who could sing along, and raised eyebrows from first-timers. ""It was so surprising and so contemporary,"" Lovett said. ""They thought it was so new, and so exciting."" In fact, Lovett said, she's lost several copies to students who borrowed the CD and never brought it back. Instead, they pass it around to others, just the way people heard it all those years ago.

"(CNN) -- John Hickenlooper grabbed the attention of national Democrats in 2010 when he withstood a national Republican wave to win the governorship in Colorado, an emerging battleground state. He caught some lucky breaks on the way: Colorado Republicans failed to nominate a serious candidate in a three-way race, and Hickenlooper ran a quirky and widely praised television ad that depicted him showering with his clothes on, symbolically rinsing off the stink of negative campaigning. HickenlooperÂ has also attracted notice by breaking with some of his fellow Democrats in an effort to create a more business-friendly climate in the state.Â As a co-founder of Denver's Wynkoop Brewing Company, Hickenlooper still talks proudly about his experience as a small-business owner. He's also a huge fan of craft beer and indie rock bands such as The Shins and the Avett Brothers. Time magazine named Hickenlooper, who served two terms as Denver's mayor, one of the country's best mayors in 2005. With one of the highest approval ratings of any governor, Hickenlooper might be Barack Obama's best asset in Colorado as the president tries to carry the state's nine electoral votes for the second time. He sat down with CNN at the annual meeting of the National Governors Association in Williamsburg, Virginia, last weekend. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . CNN: The suburbanites around Denver are exactly the kind of independent-minded voters President Barack Obama needs in his fold to win in November. Do you see the campaign's questions about Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital and offshore bank accounts resonating with those voters or do they fall flat? Gov. John Hickenlooper: To a certain extent, the suburban soccer moms are somewhat accepting of the fact that business is rough and tumble, and that some jobs get cut when you are taking over a business that's failing. Some job cuts are necessary. But I think they have a different sensitivity if people are avoiding paying taxes in the United States and making profits on business done in the United States but finding ways to avoid taxation. I think as more facts come out, that's something that of all the Bain-related stories might have some serious ramifications in terms of how normal people deal with it. What's interesting, especially with the independent voters, is there is a level of patriotism. We pay our taxes, and we don't want to pay any more taxes, we hate government waste. But everyone should pay their share. It's almost visceral. When I was in the restaurant business, I used to see people get into these debates. It's liberal Democrats, it's conservative Republicans, it's almost all independents. There is a tremendous repulsion for people that get out of paying their share. CNN: As a business guy, do you think some of the harder-edged questions about Romney's private sector record turn off some people in the business community? Hickenlooper: It does. There are certain people that think that. I think what people are concerned about is you're branding all business as bad, which is certainly not the case. No step forward this country has ever taken has been without the business community helping move us forward. Whether you care about homelessness, whether you care about education reform or whatever, the resources for that come from economic vitality -- a whole lot of businesses being successful and creating wealth, and then that wealth being used to help homeless kids. CNN: Do you view his experience at Bain as part of wealth creation at large, the kind that lifts up homeless kids, for instance, or is it a different thing entirely? Hickenlooper: It's a component of the business system. I think what really creates wealth in this country, the major part of our wealth creation, comes from entrepreneurs, people starting businesses. That's my preference because I lived part of that life. If you really squint your eyes and look at job creation, entrepreneurs create businesses, create jobs. They are always creating something. Generally it's small businesses, but when they get acquired by a large business as part of that acquisition, there are overlapping marketing departments, overlapping accounting departments, so they shed jobs. There is a downsizing. So once that happens, once you get these companies consolidating, they are always looking at efficiency. And that is really not job creation. There are exceptions. As you get larger companies together, they shed jobs and they become more efficient and more profitable, so the stock price goes up, but that's not pushing the country forward at the same level that entrepreneurs are. They are the ones that are creating the jobs that have customers. That is one of the defining points. They are creating jobs that have customers rather than just trying to control costs. CNN: When your friends in the business community complain about the president or say that Romney will lower their taxes or costs, what do you say to convince them that Obama is going to help their bottom line? Hickenlooper: We have many discussions. What I tell everyone is what we need to create in this country is rising tide. We have to get the whole country moving forward. That's not just one thing or one component of our economy. That's the whole economy, right? So you can't keep cutting funding for higher education. That's a big part of how these entrepreneurs get started -- research grants or great ideas that come out of some laboratory at Colorado State University. Those entrepreneurs need to be able to take that and grow it. The whole ecosystem has got to go up. The president is committed to investment and the key parts of what a business ecosystem to succeed. It needs an education system, and it needs a health care system. I keep going to my friends in business and I say, 'Alright so, whether you want to talk about Obamacare or Romneycare, let's pick one.' "" CNN: Does Obamacare help the president in Colorado? Hickenlooper: I think it helps him everywhere, ultimately. When I sit down with business guys, I tell them, 'Let's say we don't want to do Obamacare. Secretary Sebelius has said we will give waivers if you find a way to expand coverage, control costs and prove outcomes. We will give you all the waivers you want.' That's an opportunity to pick our own system. But everybody wants to expand coverage. Everybody recognizes that small businesses can't get coverage. We already passed our health care exchange, and we did it with Republicans and Democrats. Let's not get caught up in these false arguments. You can sit there and look at the whole system of what Obama's proposing and the whole system of what Romney's proposing, and I think the president's has a higher probability of rising the whole tide and moving the economy more rapidly. CNN: What do you think Obama could do better in the campaign? What would help him win Colorado? Hickenlooper: You know what he loves. He loves basketball. He loves movies. He loves his family. I think that's a huge advantage. I don't think he shows it enough. Those little things -- you have never heard that story. When he talked to the firefighters (who were recently battling the Colorado wildfires), he talked to 80 firefighters, and within five minutes moved them emotionally and inspired them. That's something that he does, and it's just who he is. He has always been able to do that. He wasn't scripted, and there was no teleprompter. It was just him connecting. I think he has to find more opportunities to demonstrate to the American people who he is. Because he is real. CNN: Last question: How are the NFL Denver Broncos going to do this year? Hickenlooper: I love (former Broncos quarterback Tim) Tebow. I thought he was a remarkable guy. I was a big Tebow fan. I am a huge Tebow fan. I think he's going to be a great quarterback somewhere, just watch. I think Peyton Manning, he had all these teams to pick from, but he picked the Broncos because they have been building like crazy. And he thinks they can go to the Super Bowl in the next two years. When Peyton Manning, who knows a lot about football, when he says they can go to the Super Bowl, that means we're all going to be tuned in.","John Hickenlooper says there is a repulsion for those who don't pay their fair share .

"Beijing (CNN) -- At first glance, Chinese President Xi Jinping enters 2014 as the country's most powerful and popular leader in recent memory. A year into his expected decade-long reign, he has amassed more titles than his two immediate predecessors. Heading not only the ruling Communist Party, the 1.5-million strong military and the state, Xi also sits atop two newly created entities with ultimate authority on the most important issues facing the government: a national security council and a leadership group that decides on the course of the country's ""overall reform."" His star power has soared, too. Xi's recent visit to a Beijing restaurant for some cheap steamed buns has turned the eatery into an instant shrine -- with crowds lining up to snap pictures of the table he sat on and order the so-called ""presidential set."" Even his brief New Year's address won admiration on social media for its human touch, when viewers noticed family photos in the background featuring his glamorous singer wife. With all the apparent political capital and personal charisma at his disposal, is Xi strong enough to launch bold reform amid slowing economic growth and rising public discontent? In answering the question, people on opposite ends of the political spectrum are surprisingly united in their skepticism. Flies and tigers . One of Xi's most applauded moves since he became the Communist Party chief has been an intensified fight against corruption, a lightning rod for mass discontent across the country. He pledged to target ""flies and tigers"" alike in describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of their position. According to state media, some 108,000 officials were disciplined in the first nine months of 2013 and almost 20 minister-level senior officials have fallen from grace since late 2012. State media has cited the trial and conviction last year of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- though called politically motivated by Bo supporters -- as one prime example of Xi's determination. Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal . China watchers have also detected signs of a possible investigation into Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar and one-time patron of Bo. If announced, Zhou would be the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges. ""Xi has made good on his word,"" said Han Deqiang, an economics professor at Beihang University in Beijing well known for his passionate advocacy of Maoism. ""There is an obvious link between Xi's move and the revival of Maoism -- which emphasized the principle of 'serve the people' and a frugal lifestyle, and allowed Chairman Mao to establish a relatively corruption-free bureaucracy."" Pointing to a series of recent orders to ban official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- as well as Xi's visit to the steamed bun eatery, Han says the new leader is taking a leaf out of the late chairman's book. However, economist Mao Yushi -- no relation to Chairman Mao -- says Xi has failed to address the roots of corruption. ""Without systemic reform, new cases of corruption will pop up while old ones are being addressed,"" he said. ""The fundamental solution is to destroy the soil that breeds corruption -- the opportunities for officials to take bribes in areas like land control and family planning."" War and peace . On December 26, Xi paid homage to Mao Zedong in his mausoleum on the 120th anniversary of the late chairman's birth. The same day, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe defied Chinese warnings and visited a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, capping a year of fast-deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations stemming from competing claims over a chain of islands in the East China Sea. China, Japan deploy Harry Potter villain in latest spat . China has certainly flexed its military muscles since Xi took control, sending its only aircraft carrier for a month-long training mission late last year in the South China Sea, where it is also locked in territorial disputes with several neighboring countries. Most noticeably, though, the Chinese military last November declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea that includes the disputed islands. Despite objections from the United States and its allies, the Chinese military has warned that it would identify, monitor and respond to any air threats or unidentified flying objects coming from the sea. China's air defense zone: What you need to know . Cheered by nationalists, who have yearned for the return of Mao-era hardline stance against the Americans or Soviets, the ADIZ move is seen by some hawks as a sign of Xi's increasing strength and confidence. Following Abe's shrine visit, the Beijing government has declared him ""not welcome"" in China. ""Abe's shrine visit has given Xi the perfect excuse to project his power both at home and abroad,"" said Hu Jia, one of China's most prominent human rights activists, who was imprisoned for more than three years for his advocacy. ""Abe helped Xi, who needs a rallying cry and an angle to divert public attention from domestic problems. ""But more and more ordinary citizens are seeing through this and no longer willing to be used as the government's pawn."" 'Who am I?' Left, center or right -- no matter where one stands ideologically -- Xi seems to keep sending everyone mixed signals. Before Maoists could finish savoring the news of Xi bowing in front of Mao's preserved body in his mausoleum and praising the late chairman on his anniversary, the president reportedly made no mention of Mao in his extensive remarks to senior government advisers on New Year's Eve and emphasized ""liberating our thoughts"" instead. Xi's fight against corruption and populist style have won him genuine admiration from a young, well-educated urban crowd. But he has also stifled freedom of speech in social media and cracked down on a nascent civil society movement -- often alienating or antagonizing the same demographic. China 'employs 2 million to police internet' Most controversial of all, in a widely circulated speech, Xi raised the notion of ""not using the second 30 years (of the People's Republic) to repudiate the first 30 years, and vice versa."" The first three decades of Communist rule after 1949 -- commonly referred to as the Mao era -- was largely remembered in the West as an isolated regime, a failed planned economy and a nation thrown into chaos by Mao's Cultural Revolution. The second three decades started in the late 1970s when late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping launched economic reform and re-opened the country to the outside world -- a period marked by breakneck economic growth as well as rising social tensions brought by a widening income gap and rampant corruption. For Maoists, the ""two 30 years"" concept appears to be a natural correction to Deng and his successors' deviation from the orthodox system. ""Chairman Mao is our founding father -- rejecting him means the rejection of the regime's legitimacy,"" said Professor Han, who has expressed disapproval of what happened to Bo, a big proponent of reviving Maoism. ""The top leadership has noticed the grassroots support for Maoism and taken action to reaffirm the regime's foundation."" Economist Mao holds a more nuanced view. He says Xi has made some progress with reforms amid strong resistance from entrenched interest groups. ""Maoists are his biggest threats because they are against reform and opening-up, which they consider to be a path of capitalist exploitation,"" he said. ""Why bother reform at all if you don't thoroughly reject the Maoist ideology? ""So the fundamental questions about Xi remain: What does he stand for? What does he want? What are his values?"" Other than an ambiguous notion of fulfilling the great Chinese Dream, it seems that Xi hasn't given clear answers to these challenging questions. And as divisions in Chinese society grow deeper, time may not be on his side -- and the future of 1.3 billion people is at stake.","President Xi Jinping has assumed complete control of China in past 12 months .

"(CNN) -- It captivated millions of people around the world for eight days in the summer of 1969. It brought glory to the embattled U.S. space program and inspired beliefs that anything was possible. Moon landing hoax theorists point to the ""rippling"" flag as evidence the landings were faked. It's arguably the greatest technological feat of the 20th century. And to some, it was all a lie. Forty years after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon, a small cult of conspiracy theorists maintains the historic event -- and the five subsequent Apollo moon landings -- were staged. These people believe NASA fabricated the landings to trump their Soviet rivals and fulfill President Kennedy's goal of ferrying humans safely to and from the moon by the end of the 1960s. ""I do know the moon landings were faked,"" said crusading filmmaker Bart Sibrel, whose aggressive interview tactics once provoked Aldrin to punch him in the face. ""I'd bet my life on it."" Sibrel may seem crazy, but he has company. A 1999 Gallup poll found that a scant 6 percent of Americans doubted the Apollo 11 moon landing happened, and there is anecdotal evidence that the ranks of such conspiracy theorists, fueled by innuendo-filled documentaries and the Internet, are growing. Twenty-five percent of respondents to a survey in the British magazine Engineering & Technology said they do not believe humans landed on the moon. A handful of Web sites and blogs circulate suspicions about NASA's ""hoax."" And a Google search this week for ""Apollo moon landing hoax"" yielded more than 1.5 billion results. ""We love conspiracies,"" said Roger Launius, a senior curator at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington. ""Going to the moon is hard to understand. And it's easier for some people to accept the answer that, 'Well, maybe we didn't go to the moon.' A lot of it is naivete."" Conspiracy theories about the Apollo missions began not long after the last astronaut returned from the moon in 1972. Bill Kaysing, a technical writer for Rocketdyne, which built rocket engines for NASA's Apollo program, published a 1974 book, ""We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle."" In the book and elsewhere, Kaysing argued that NASA lacked the technology in 1969 to land humans safely on the moon, that the Apollo astronauts would have been poisoned by passing through the Van Allen radiation belts that ring the Earth and that NASA's photos from the moon contained suspicious anomalies.  See improved NASA footage of the 1969 moonwalk » . Kaysing theorized NASA sent the Apollo 11 astronauts up in a rocket until it was out of sight, then transferred the lunar capsule and its three passengers to a military cargo plane that dropped the capsule eight days later in the Pacific, where it was recovered. In the meantime, he believed, NASA officials filmed the ""moon landing"" at Area 51, the high-security military base in the Nevada desert, and brainwashed the astronauts to ensure their cooperation. Some believe Kaysing's theories inspired the 1978 movie ""Capricorn One,"" in which NASA fakes a Mars landing on a remote military base, then goes to desperate lengths to cover it up. Others insist NASA recruited director Stanley Kubrick, hot off ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" to film the ""faked"" moon landings. Oh, and those moon rocks? Lunar meteorites from Antarctica. Decades later, Kaysing's beliefs formed the foundation for ""Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?"" a sensational 2001 Fox TV documentary that spotted eerie ""inconsistencies"" in NASA's Apollo images and TV footage. Among them: no blast craters are visible under the landing modules; shadows intersect instead of running parallel, suggesting the presence of an unnatural light source; and a planted American flag appears to ripple in a breeze although there's no wind on the moon. The hour-long special sparked such interest in the topic that NASA took the unusual step of issuing a news release and posting a point-by-point rebuttal on its Web site. The press release began: ""Yes. Astronauts did land on the moon."" In various documents, NASA has countered that the Apollo astronauts passed through the Van Allen belts too quickly to be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation; that the module's descent engines weren't powerful enough to leave a blast crater; that the shadows in photos were distorted by wide-angle lenses and sloping lunar terrain; and that the Apollo flags had horizontal support bars that made the flags swing. Kaysing died in 2005, but not before grabbing the attention of Sibrel, a Nashville, Tennessee, filmmaker who has since become the most visible proponent of the Apollo hoax theories. With funding from an anonymous donor, Sibrel wrote and directed a 47-minute documentary in 2001 that reiterated many of the now-familiar hoax arguments. Critics of moon-landing hoax theorists, and there are many, say it would be impossible for tens of thousands of NASA employees and Apollo contractors to keep such a whopping secret for almost four decades. But Sibrel believes the Apollo program was so compartmentalized that only its astronauts and a handful of high-level NASA officials knew the entire story. Sibrel spent years ambushing Apollo astronauts and insisting they swear on a Bible before his cameras that they walked on the moon. ""When someone has gotten away with a crime, in my opinion, they deserve to be ambushed,"" Sibrel said. ""I'm a journalist trying to get at the truth."" In an episode made infamous on YouTube, Sibrel confronted Aldrin in 2002 and called him ""a coward, a liar and a thief."" Aldrin, then 72, socked the thirtysomething Sibrel in the face, knocking him backwards. ""I don't want to call attention to the individuals who are trying to promote and shuffle off this hoax on people,"" Aldrin told CNN in a recent interview. ""I feel sorry for the gullible people who're going to go along with them. I guess it's just natural human reaction to want to be a part of 'knowing something that somebody doesn't know.' But it's misguided. It's just a shame."" It's been 37 years since the last Apollo moon mission, and tens of millions of younger Americans have no memories of watching the moon landings live. A 2005-2006 poll by Mary Lynne Dittmar, a space consultant based in Houston, Texas, found that more than a quarter of Americans 18 to 25 expressed some doubt that humans set foot on the moon. ""As the number of people who were not yet born at the time of the Apollo program increases, the number of questions [about the moon landings] also may increase,"" NASA said in a statement. ""Conspiracy theories are always difficult to refute because of the impossibility of proving a negative."" Launius, the National Air and Space Museum curator, believes Apollo conspiracy theories resonate with people who are disengaged from society and distrustful of government. He also believes their numbers are overblown. ""These diehards are really vocal, but they're really tiny,"" he said. But Stuart Robbins, a Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics at the University of Colorado who gives lectures defending NASA from Apollo hoax theorists, believes their influence can be harmful. ""If people don't think we were able to go to the moon, then they don't believe in the ingenuity of human achievement,"" he said. ""Going to the moon and returning astronauts safely back to Earth is arguably one of the most profound achievements in human history, and so when people simply believe it was a hoax, they lose out on that shared experience and doubt what humans can do."" In its information campaign against Apollo's ""debunkers,"" NASA may have a potent ace up its sleeve, however. Its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is now circling the moon with powerful cameras, snapping crisp pictures that could reveal Apollo 11's Eagle lander squatting on the moon's surface. Then again, conspiracy theorists may just say NASA doctored the photos. ""Will the LRO's incredibly high-resolution images of the lunar surface, including, eventually, the Apollo landing sites, finally quell the lunacy of the Moon Hoax believers? Obviously it won't,"" writes astronomer Phil Plait in his blog on Discover magazine's Web site. ""These true believers don't live in an evidence-based world.""","A cult of conspiracy theorists believe NASA faked the Apollo moon landings .

"(CNN) -- Bears riding motorcycles, tigers jumping through flaming hoops and pigs leaping off diving boards. Just some of the ""entertainment"" that can be seen at circuses, zoos and safari parks in China, according to a report by Animals Asia into animals cruelty. The Hong Kong-based animal rights campaign group visited 13 safari parks and zoos in China and according to David Neale, Animals Asia's Animal Welfare Director, found that the animal shows ""portray the animal to the public in a humiliating way"" and have no educational value. ""There is a misunderstanding really within China at the moment about what these animals are experiencing,"" Neale told CNN. The report says that many of the performance animals that include tigers, lions, Asiatic black bears, elephants and monkeys are born and bred in captivity and brutalized throughout their lives. ""These animals have been suffering from birth, really. Once they're born they go into this industry. And straight away the trainers are starting to brutalize them to make them to do these tricks.... We saw some of the training of the younger animals; they were continually hit to make sure they learnt these tricks so that when they're out in the performance ring they perform them to the best standard."" ""Once the trick is finished they then go to the backstage area where they're housed in the most shocking conditions. All kinds of animals are held in cages full of faeces, with very little access to water, very little access to food."" The abuse of performing animals isn't specific to China. ""Animal cruelty is happening in every country across the world,"" said Neale. However Neale points out that in China there are currently no animal protection laws, a reason why Animals Asia have worked with Chinese academics to draft legislation not just for animals in captivity, but all animals. Despite the findings of their investigation, Neale is encouraged by a few signs of progress by the Chinese government to take animal protection seriously. According to a government report on July 29 the Chinese State Forestry Administration accused companies that have animal performance shows of having excessive focus on profits, leading to the mistreatment and death of the animals. ""We're very pleased that the Chinese government has said that they want the zoos and safari parks to look at the conditions they keep their animals in to rectify these problems,"" said Neale.","Report into Chinese zoos and safari parks found abuse of perforrming animals .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's complaint that working long hours caused her to collapse from exhaustion triggered union investigations of the ""Liz & Dick"" production, two unions said. Producers called paramedics to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Marina del Rey, California, after Lohan was unresponsive to knocks on her door Friday morning. Lohan, 25, was simply sleeping after working ""a grueling schedule the past few days,"" publicist Steve Honig said Friday. She is in the middle of filming the Lifetime movie in which she portrays legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor. Lohan later posted a Twitter message that led to the union set visits: . ""Note to self.. After working 85 hours in 4 days, and being up all night shooting, be very aware that you might pass out from exhaustion & 7 paramedics MIGHT show up @ your door.... Hopefully theyre cute. Otherwise it would be a real let down."" Union contract rules limit the number of hours actors and crew members can work on a movie or television production. Both SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors, and IATSE, the stage workers union, confirmed they visited the set of the Lifetime Network movie . ""We have thoroughly investigated this matter and our business representatives have visited, and will continue to visit, the set of Liz & Dick,"" SAG-AFTRA said in a statement late Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- A frigid winter storm system that put Dallas in the deep freeze will hit the East Coast on Sunday. Lucky for those people, it should be a one-day affair. Snow, ice or freezing rain will fall on Washington, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston on Sunday, the National Weather Service said. On Monday, temperatures will rise into the 40s and any accumulation should start to melt, the weather service predicts. Folks in other parts of the country will need an extra blanket on the bed. Unseasonably cold weather will continue. On Sunday, temperatures are expected to only reach about 10 degrees in the northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains and the upper Midwest. Sleet and freezing rain is forecast from the Tennessee Valley to Mid-Atlantic on Sunday. Parts of Texas, the Upper South and the Midwest socked by the winter storm will warm up just a little bit on Sunday. The Weather Service said the temps will rise into the high 30s and 40s, but drop below freezing again Sunday night. How cold was it? On Saturday Southern Methodist University gave away tickets for its football game with Central Florida but didn't get many takers. All but a few seats in the stadium were empty. The high temperature at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport Saturday was 26 degrees -- the coldest high temperature ever recorded there on December 7 and the coldest December day in Dallas/Fort Worth in 23 years, CNN affiliate WFAA-TV reported. At least seven people have died in storm-related incidents, with the Texas State Patrol reporting two weather-related fatalities on Saturday but providing no details. In Lewisville, about 25 miles north of Dallas, the driver of a pickup lost control on an icy road, spun out of control on a road over Lake Lewisville, went over a guard rail and landed in the water. Firefighters dove into the frigid water and towed the truck to the bridge. The unidentified driver died. A passenger was killed Thursday when a vehicle lost control and crashed into another car in Hockley County, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. In Arkansas man was killed late Thursday when a tree fell on his camper in Pope County, the Department of Emergency Management said. Highway Patrol officials in Oklahoma blamed at least one death, in Muskogee, on the weather. In New Mexico, one person died when a semi crashed near Clines Corners. The storm took a toll on travel, causing hundreds of car crashes and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of departures at Dallas/FortWorth International Airport. The FAA said Saturday operations had returned to normal. Abandoned cars littered the interstate outside Dallas. Winter came much earlier than usual in many sections of the nation. Farmersburg, Indiana, recorded up to 10 inches of snow Thursday and temperatures fell into the single digits at night. ""This was early for us to have this much measurable snow late in the fall, but has happened before,"" Mark Ivy told CNN iReport. ""It is more the cold that is unusual."" In East Kingsford, Michigan, iReporter Jason Asselin said he's covering blankets to keep you the cold. ""In December, our average temperatures are in the 20s,"" he said. ""Currently it is zero degrees outside."" Across the High Plains and into the Great Lakes, temperatures were expected to be 10 to 35 degrees below average, with wind chill values predicted to reach 35 to 45 degrees below zero in some areas. From the central Appalachians through central New England, snow is expected into early Saturday morning, the National Weather Service said. It was cold in Memphis, Tennessee, for a second straight day, with a high of 24 degrees. The weather will be a little warmer Sunday and Monday, with the mercury creeping up to 36 and 43 degrees, respectively. The governors of Tennessee and Arkansas declared states of emergency ahead of the worst of the storm.

"(CNN) -- Every country has an unofficial doctrine -- a mantra if you will. In America, it's the ""independent spirit."" In Germany, it's the ""no-nonsense work ethic."" In Egypt, well, in Egypt it was always ""laughter through adversity."" Until now. Adel Imam, one of Egypt's most beloved comedic actors, was sentenced to jail for insulting Islam. Not for something he said but for roles he played in films. Yes, you read that right. That's like sentencing Edward Norton to life in prison for his role in ""American History X."" What makes this court ruling even more preposterous is that these films are not recent films. They are pre-revolution films that were approved by the former government. Last week a court upheld a three-month prison sentence given to the 71-year old actor in February for ""insulting"" Islam in his films ""Morgan Ahmed Morgan"" and ""Al-Zaeem."" It was one of two cases brought against him by an Islamist lawyer, although the second case was last week overturned, according to Amnesty International. As a child, I remember watching Adel Iman films when I visited my family in Egypt during summer break. Even with my broken Arabic, his mix of wit, facial expressions and physical humor amused me endlessly. Egyptians have long been envied for their ability to tell a joke. Over the decades they created films, television series and plays that delighted audiences across the region. One can say that in Cairo, a city with nearly 20 million people living in a space the size of my bedroom, it's impossible to get by without a sense of humor. See also: Comic explores a changed Cairo . But this long and proud history is in serious jeopardy. And if it collapses, I firmly believe so does Egypt's hope for a better future. As an Egyptian-American comedian, I had the opportunity to be part of the rise of stand-up comedy in the region. During my first show in Cairo, maybe four or five years ago, I remember one local comedian was so nervous because he thought he ""might be arrested"" by the government just for telling jokes. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to produce the first stand-up comedy show post-Egyptian revolution. I remember the buzz in the air as comedians made light of a tense situation -- the ouster of Hosni Mubarak and the uncertainty of the country. As a performer, I was able to address, for the first time in my shows, sexual harassment and the religious hypocrisy of ""complete religious freedom as long as you're Muslim or Christian."" We even had a female comedian wearing hijab perform on stage. The progression of the country in such a short time period was mind boggling. Until now. Who would have guessed that the limited freedom of speech afforded to Egyptians under the old regime would develop into no freedom of speech at all? That a country, which was the ""beacon of hope"" less than one year ago, is now a catalyst for a ""return to the dark ages."" See also: Comedian stands up for Arabs' right to laugh . I'm not saying that we shouldn't be sensitive to religious and cultural needs -- though my personal vote as a comedian is everything should be open to criticism and satire. Many countries have restrictions on programming, including the U.S., but to retroactively punish someone for previously approved material is beyond reason. Mr. Imam has the opportunity to appeal but, regardless of if he wins or not, a clear message has been sent: any challenge to the ""societal norm"" will not be tolerated. This doesn't just prevent comedians, writers and artists from finding humor in the single biggest aspect of every Egyptian's life but it also will suppress creativity in general. Can a Muslim character in a film not drink alcohol? It happens everyday in real life but are we not allowed to show it because the courts want us to pretend it doesn't exist? More importantly, what happens to that actor playing the part -- even if he is really drinking apple juice instead of a beer? Regardless of the outcome in the Adel Imam trial, if Egyptians don't raise their voices against this ridiculous verdict, this may not just signal the demise of comedy in Egypt -- this could very well be the demise of the country itself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ronnie Khalil.","Egyptian actor Adel Imam found guilty of defaming Islam in some of his movies .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is in no hurry to decide about a potential 2016 bid for the White House, saying it is a decision ""not to be made lightly."" As the political drumbeat builds for a possible Clinton candidacy, with polls showing that she is the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, the former secretary of state was asked in a New York magazine interview published online Sunday whether she wrestles with the idea. ""I do,"" she said, ""but I'm both pragmatic and realistic. I think I have a pretty good idea of the political and governmental challenges that are facing our leaders, and I'll do whatever I can from whatever position I find myself in to advocate for the values and the policies I think are right for the country. ""I will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision one way or the other."" Speech fans the flames of speculation . Much has been made about a potential Clinton run since she stepped down this year as secretary of state, a position she accepted from President Barack Obama after losing to him in a bruising Democratic presidential primary in 2008. Some of Clinton's closest confidants insist she will run, even if she hasn't realized it yet, the article said. Sarah Palin: Clinton ill-suited for president . Of Clinton's failed 2008 bid, her aide Melanne Verveer told the magazine, ""She doesn't repeat her mistakes."" A CNN/ORC International survey released last week showed that 65% of Democrats and independents who lean toward that party say they would likely back Clinton as their presidential nominee. Vice President Joe Biden came in a distant second, at 10%, with freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6%, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at 2%. The CNN survey is in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated Clinton is far ahead of all the other possible Democratic candidates. Opinion: Obama did Clinton a huge favor . Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, said the polls are flattering but ""don't mean much now. We're a long way ahead."" ""I think she would be the first to tell you that there is no such thing as a done deal, ever, by anybody. But I don't know what she's going to do,"" he told CNN's Fareed Zakaria. In her first interview since leaving the State Department, Hillary Clinton told the magazine: ""I'm not in any hurry. I think it's a serious decision, not to be made lightly but it's also not one that has to be made soon."" She said the election is more than three years away, and the push to keep moving on to the next event is not good for the country. ""It's like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there, and you want to talk to them about something that's really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk about that particular person, and they just want to know what's next,"" she said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A fluffy white polar bear cub that has captured German hearts is making her first public appearance Tuesday at the Nuremberg City Zoo. Flocke was bottle-fed by zookeepers because they feared she would be eaten by her mother. Flocke, whose name means ""snowflake"" in German, was born at the zoo in December. She gained international attention in January after zookeepers said they had taken Flocke away from her mother because of concerns she would eat her. The zoo's other female polar bear had recently eaten her two offspring, and the zoo was worried that Flocke's mother would do the same.

Sweet pictures of the young bear being cuddled by her keepers or sleeping with her tongue sticking out boosted Flocke's popularity, and she quickly eclipsed Knut, the polar bear at the Berlin Zoo. Knut was a sensation when he was born in December 2006, but at 16 months old, he's no longer considered as cute as his Nuremberg counterpart. Flocke has grown into a bouncy young cub who is learning how to use her large paws. The zoo's latest pictures of Flocke, from early last week, show her frolicking in her enclosure and paddling in a pool of shallow water. The first chance to see Flocke up close was Tuesday, when the zoo held a media event with about 50 members of the public.

"(CNN) -- Control of Tripoli International Airport changed hands Saturday evening, after an alliance of Islamist militias from around Libya seized the reins from a rival group. Fighting was intense and spread from around the airport to other parts of Tripoli. Unknown fighter jets struck locations used by the alliance -- known as the Libya Dawn forces -- killing at least 12 Misrata militiamen, according to the Libyan state news agency, LANA. Air traffic has been interrupted since the fighting began, with most international carriers suspending flights in and out of Libya. The airport had previously been under the control of moderate militias from the western city of Zintan, who took control of it three years ago during the Libyan revolution, which toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The takeover of the airport followed a more than a monthlong offensive dubbed ""Libya Dawn,"" the alliance said on social media. Nearly three years after a revolution and NATO military intervention, Libya continues to be beset by instability -- politically, militarily and otherwise. That has included extensive violence, much of it involving increasingly powerful militias that have outgunned the North African nation's central government. Late last month, the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, the United Nations and other international organizations and businesses evacuated their staffs due to the unrest. U.S. Embassy in Libya evacuates personnel . The airport in Tripoli has long been a focal point of this fighting, as fighters tried to wrest control of it from the Zintan militia. The head of Libya's U.N. mission, Tarek Mitri, said in July that the stakes were high for all sides. ""As the number of military actors mobilizing and consolidating their presence within the capital continues to grow, there is a mounting sense of a probable imminent and significant escalation in the conflict,"" Mitri said.

"(CNN) -- A former Puerto Rico police officer was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Thursday for his role in providing security for drug deals in an FBI sting in which he received $2,000 per transaction, authorities said. Javier A. Diaz Castro, 30, was convicted in December of two counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, two counts of attempting to possess with the intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, and two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug transaction, a prosecutor said. Diaz, along with 88 other law enforcement officers in Puerto Rico and 44 other people, were indicted in October 2010 as part of the FBI's Operation Guard Shack, which targeted public corruption and cocaine trafficking, federal authorities said. As of Thursday, 128 of the defendants have pleaded guilty or have been convicted at trial, including Diaz, according to Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer and Special Agent in Charge Joseph S. Campbell of the FBI's San Juan Division. Diaz provided security for what he thought were drug deals at least twice in 2010 -- but the transactions were part of the FBI sting, authorities said. Diaz, a 10-year police veteran assigned to the frauds unit, carried his service weapon in the transactions, federal authorities said. Another Puerto Rico police officer allegedly brought Diaz into the criminal enterprise, authorities said. U.S. District Judge Gustavo A.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Thousands of people in Moscow rallied for and against Vladimir Putin in separate rallies Monday after official election results showed the Russian prime minister handily winning back the presidency. International observers blasted the Sunday election, saying the outcome was never in doubt. Some foreign governments pledged to work with the new leader despite concerns about electoral violations. ""The election has not been exemplary, to say the least,"" said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. With more than 99% of the votes counted, Putin received 63.75% of the vote, easily avoiding a runoff in a field of five candidates. Putin's closest challenger, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, got slightly more than 17%, and the other three candidates -- including Mikhail Prokhorov, the owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team -- were in the single digits. The result was still considered preliminary, however; the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported final results may come next week. Putin, 59, declared victory before thousands of cheering supporters near Red Square on Sunday night, and a similar crowd returned Monday to celebrate his victory, RIA Novosti reported. The news agency said about 10,000 people were at Manezhnaya Square, where sports figures and celebrities congratulated Putin and denounced the opposition's claims that the voting was unfair and rigged. Other pro-Putin rallies took place around the country, RIA Novosti said. Thousands of Putin opponents also turned out in central Moscow on Monday, and police arrested 250 people. Among them were opposition activists Ilya Yashin, Alexei Navalny and Sergey Udaltsov, the Moscow branch of the Russian Interior Ministry reported. Police detained 16 nationalists in central Moscow because they were attempting to create unrest, the ministry said, and roughly 50 supporters of the banned National Boshevik Party were detained for attempting to hold an unauthorized rally. ""All those arrested were taken to a police station for their actions to be processed, and for the authorities to decide whether to press charges,"" the Moscow branch of the ministry said. International observers blasted Russia's presidential election Monday and expressed disappointment and frustration with the way Putin won. ""The point of an election is that the outcome should be uncertain. This was not the case in Russia,"" said Tonino Picula, the head of an observer mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Observers said they observed ballot stuffing and other irregularities in about a third of polling stations they monitored, and an uneven playing field in the run-up to the election. Sounding somewhat exasperated, the Council of Europe's Tiny Kox urged Russia ""to have a fair election,"" saying ""it's not that difficult."" Ambassador Heidi Tagliavini of the OSCE was particularly critical of irregularities in vote counting because ""what matters in an election is the counting,"" she said. She declined to say whether the irregularities affected the outcome of the vote -- a landslide for Putin by international standards, if not Russian ones. And she praised incremental improvements such as web cameras in polling stations and transparent ballot boxes, as well as the ""massive mobilization of civil society demanding fair elections."" The U.S. State Department urged the Russian government to conduct an independent, credible investigation of all reported electoral violations, but it also noted steps, like webcams installed at polling places, intended to make the voting process more transparent. Some 90,000 webcams at polling places around the country allowed people around the world to watch live as Russians cast their ballots on election day. Putin called for unity Sunday night as he appeared headed for his third term as president, declaring he had won an ""open and honest fight."" But chess champion-turned-opposition-activist Garry Kasparov accused Putin's supporters of ""massive fraud,"" saying early Monday they packed the polls with additional voters. Kasparov, who served as a poll watcher in his Moscow neighborhood, said Putin's supporters ""simply added new voters to the register using so-called supplementary voter rolls."" ""At one of the polling stations, the number of extra voters even exceeded the number of registered voters,"" he said. A former KGB officer, Putin served two straight terms in the Kremlin before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. But he served as prime minister under his successor, Dmitry Medvedev, and continued to dominate Russian politics. Presidents Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Bashar al-Assad of Syria on Monday congratulated Putin on his win.

"(CNN) -- A former exotic dancer has filed a lawsuit against Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, accusing him of sexual assault. In the suit filed Monday in Dallas County, Jana Weckerly claims that Jones assaulted her in 2009 and that the Dallas Cowboys knew about and covered up the incident. Weckerly is seeking ""monetary relief of over $1,000,000,"" according to the suit. Reaction from the Cowboys was swift. Levi McCathern, an attorney representing the team, called the allegations ""completely false"" and ""a shakedown."" ""The legal complaint is unsupported by facts or evidence of any kind,"" McCathern said in a written statement. ""This is nothing more than an attempt to embarrass and extort Jerry Jones."" Read the lawsuit . Weckerly's attorney says his client is in hiding. The suit claims that the 2009 incident caused the 27-year-old to fear for her life. In the aftermath, the suit says, Weckerly has suffered depression, dealt with substance abuse and has attempted suicide. The suit is not clear on exactly when the alleged assault occurred, saying it happened ""sometime in May or June."" But the suit alleges that the owner penetrated Weckerly with his fingers and forced her to touch his genitals without her consent. McCathern pledged to fight the complaint. He added that law enforcement is now involved ""due to the seriousness of these baseless allegations."" What if Roger Goodell ran the NBA and Adam Silver captained the NFL? The allegations against the Cowboys owner is the latest distraction for the NFL, pulling the spotlight from its early season games. Ravens running back Ray Rice was cut from the team and indefinitely suspended from the league this week after video surfaced showing the moment he delivered a punch to his then-fiancÃ©e that knocked her out. The league was ridiculed by some for initially suspending Rice for only two games, a position it did not change until after the video was made public. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he does not rule out the possibility of Rice returning to the league someday. Another team owner, Jim Irsay of the Indianapolis Colts, is currently serving a six-game suspension and had to pay a $500,000 fine after pleading guilty to one misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. The $500,000 fine is the maximum allowed under league rules.

"(CNN) -- Nina Davuluri, a 24-year-old Indian-American from upstate New York, expertly twirled to the pulsing beats of a Bollywood tune during the talent portion of the Miss America pageant. At the same time, she spun the traditional notion of American beauty on its head. In the interview portion of Sunday's pageant, Davuluri was asked about Chinese-American journalist Julie Chen's decision to have eyelid surgery to advance her career. ""I don't agree with plastic surgery; however, I can understand that from a standpoint,"" Davuluri said, delivering a noncommittal, diplomatic answer. ""But more importantly, I've always viewed a Miss America as the girl next door, and the girl next door is evolving as the diversity in America evolves. She's not who she was 10 years ago, and she's not going to be the same come 10 years down the road. So I wouldn't want to change someone's looks or appearance, but definitely be confident in who you are."" While Chen made the decision to undergo eyelid surgery, Davuluri opted to highlight her heritage on a historically conservative American platform. And both women reveal that each of their definitions of beauty, to varying degrees, is rooted in the idea of individual choice -- a concept that, for better or worse, is as American as it gets. Half a century ago, Miss America was synonymous with a blond-haired, blue-eyed incarnation of beauty. But the first Indian-American winner of Miss America and Chen's candid admission reflect the evolution of American beauty, which is now less about assimilation than it is about the freedom of choice. It's been more than 60 years since the Miss America Pageant had Rule No. 7, a stipulation that barred nonwhites from participating: ""Contestant must be in good health and of the white race."" And gone is the day when it was required for contestants to list their ancestry. On the surface, this change suggests that culturally assimilating to white Anglo-Saxon Protestant ideals is no longer a prerequisite to winning. But Davuluri's win sparked criticism, including tired call-center analogies, references to terrorism and being dubbed ""Princess Jasmine"" -- for supposedly prioritizing her subcontinental roots over her star-spangled ones. Critics seemed to emphasize that her Indian heritage -- she was born in New York to parents from the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh -- and American patriotism could not occupy the same space, no matter how genuine her display. Former Miss California: How do we teach kids diversity is beautiful? Davuluri, an eloquent speaker and aspiring doctor, should be a welcome respite from a surge of recent pageant participants who have claimed headlines for all the wrong reasons. Cases in point: Blond-haired, hazel-eyed Miss Teen USA hopeful Caitlin Upton, who gained notoriety in 2007 for a largely incoherent response to a geography question, or all-American Miss Utah 2013, aka Marisa Powell, of ""create education better"" fame. Chen also faced hurdles following her decision to have plastic surgery, including a family that was initially divided over her choice. ""I did it; I moved on. No one's more proud of being Chinese than I am,"" Chen told the hosts of CBS' ""The Talk"" last week. ""After I had that done, the ball did roll for me,"" she added, referring to her new and improved journalism career. Ultimately, whether it is Julie Chen or Nina Davuluri, Miss Kansas or Miss New York, I'm grateful that they all set the stage for my own story: the daughter of Indian immigrants, born and raised in Japan and educated in the United States. It's heartening to know that there are others who exist outside traditional conventions of American identity, paving the way for a more inclusive definition of both inner and outer beauty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aarti Virani.","TV host and anchor Julie Chen reveals she had plastic surgery to advance her career .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's armed forces have a new look after President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi ordered major changes to both the military's leadership and structure on Wednesday. The expansive reshuffle appears to have removed those loyal to Yemen's previous President Ali Abdullah Saleh from their powerful positions within the military, with several other generals attaining appointments to new positions. As part of the restructuring, the elite republican guard and the first armored division will be absorbed into the country's Defense Ministry. The republican guard has been led by Saleh's eldest son, Ahmed Ali Saleh, and Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who defected during the 2011 Yemeni uprising, has commanded the first armored division. ""General Ahmed Ali and Ali Mohsen are a headache for millions of Yemenis dreaming of a better country and a real national military,"" Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni youth activist, told CNN. ""It's a good step, but it should have been done a long time ago ... It won't happen overnight,"" added Al-Muslimi. ""It will need a few years for this to work out."" Amnesty details 'horrific abuses' in southern Yemen . ""Yemen will head in the right direction with this restructuring of the armed forces and the ending of the contentious divisions in the military,"" said a Yemeni government official who was not authorized to speak to the media. Yemen's military will now consist of five branches: Land Forces, Air Forces, Navy and Coastal Defense Forces, Border Guard, and the Strategic Reserve Forces, according to a news release from the Yemeni embassy in Washington. The Land Forces command will oversee seven regional commands, and the Strategic Reserve Forces will include the recently established presidential protective brigades, the new missile defense command and the new special operations command, the release said. A top presidential aide told CNN that the restructuring needed to take place quickly if Yemen was to go forward. ""We are working towards a unified army under a unified leadership, and this needs to take place now,"" the presidential aide said, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue. The changes came as protests continued in front of Hadi's residence. Demonstrators said they wouldn't participate in the upcoming National Dialogue Conference unless Saleh's relatives and loyalists who hold key military and security posts are removed. Yemeni officials have been hoping all the political factions in the country would meet at the conference. President of Yemen visits White House . Youth activists celebrated in Change Square on Wednesday, calling the latest decrees a clear victory for reformists and those seeking democracy.

""After the removal of Saleh aides, we will seek justice for those who were killed by the previous regime,"" he added. Hadi took power in February as part of a Gulf Cooperation Council-backed deal that forced Saleh to trade his position for immunity after a year of political unrest destabilized the country.

"(CNN) -- From the world's biggest manufacturer of mobile phone batteries to a car company with global pretensions, BYD is a Chinese company that has roared onto the international stage energized by its workaholic founder Wang Chuanfu. Building his own dreams: Wang Chuanfu has turned BYD into an international company in less than 15 years. Wang's hands-on approach to running a business with 130,000 employees  -- he still eats in the company canteen and lives in a BYD-owned housing complex -- isn't too far removed from how he built the company from scratch in 1995 when he was 29 years old. Wang trained as an engineer and studied the patents of other companies' mobile phone batteries, even taking them apart to see how they were made. He raised some start-up capital from a relative to create his own mobile phone battery-making business in Shenzhen, the special economic zone just north of Hong Kong. BYD's business approach differed from the likes of Sony and Sanyo by substituting an automated system for one of China's biggest resources, physical labor. Employing thousands of people was cheaper than installing expensive robotic assembly lines, and by 2000 BYD had become the biggest mobile phone battery maker in the world. Wang bought a failing Chinese car company in 2003 to enter the automobile market, and BYD now has a number of models available in China, including a plug-hybrid car cheaper than the market-leading Toyota Prius. The success of BYD has attracted plenty of attention from industry analysts and investors from the West, including Warren Buffet. The billionaire American has invested $250 million in BYD, making even more people in the West sit up and take note of the company. Wang isn't content to just compete in the hybrid and electric car market in China; he aims to keep BYD's meteoric rise going and make it the world's biggest car maker by 2025. ""It is a big ambition. In January and February 2009 China was the world's biggest automobile consuming market for those months. So based on this, China can sell more than 10 million automobiles this year. So maybe China can exceed the USA and become the biggest market in the world,"" Wang told CNN. BYD stands for ""Build Your Dreams"" and Wang is trying to fulfill the aspiration among many in China of creating a national champion; a brand with international respect and reputation of quality. Wang believes the electric car can be that product, and BYD the company to do it. ""For new energy vehicles...China is on the same level or even leading other countries. In the field of new energy cars, China hopes that Chinese companies can catch up with the rest of the world and catch up with the pace,"" said Wang. But the term ""Made in China"" still has a stigma attached to it. The scandals of tainted milk and toys that had to be recalled rocked China in 2008 and diminished the reputation of Chinese products abroad. ""This kind of 'Made in China' is different from other types of 'Made in China.' Our products have never been recalled, unlike many of our competitors. Judging from that, products made in China are sometimes better that those made elsewhere. As long as there are high-standards, Chinese manufacturing companies can definitely meet those standards,"" said Wang. China also has acute environmental problems. It is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and Wang is aware that being an entrepreneur also means having an eye on the environmental impact of his business. ""As an entrepreneur, I think I have to consider both aspects. One part is the creation of a new business mode, or the revelation of new business competition. The other is that it's for social responsibility, making our Earth bluer. ""Urban pollution, reliance on petroleum and emission of carbon dioxide are three problems that entrepreneurs have to consider for basic social responsibility,"" said Wang.","Founder of car and battery company BYD that aims to be world leader .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Chris Dodd's announcement that he is retiring follows an illustrious career, but one that has recently been overshadowed by controversies, political woes and personal tragedies. ""I love my job as your senator. I always have, still do. However, this past year has raised some challenges that insisted I take stock of my life,"" the Democratic senator said in front of his Connecticut home Wednesday. During this session of Congress, Dodd was at the center of what he called the ""two most important issues of our time"": health care and financial reform. Dodd is chairman of the banking committee, and when his close friend and colleague, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, was battling brain cancer, he stepped in as acting chairman of the Senate health committee. The death of Kennedy in August was devastating for Dodd, who worked alongside the Massachusetts senator for decades. And Kennedy's death came just weeks after Dodd's sister passed away. And Dodd, 65, was diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer last summer. ""In the midst of all of this, [I] found myself in the toughest political shape of my career,"" Dodd said Wednesday. A source close to Dodd says his recent personal tragedies and challenges weighed heavily in his decision to retire. Dodd is Connecticut's longest-serving senator. He took office in 1981 after three terms in the House. But his prospects in the upcoming election were not good. An internal Dodd campaign poll taken last month showed him trailing the leading Republican contender for his seat, Rob Simmons, 46-51 percent. That deficit is significant in the Democratic-leaning state of Connecticut, where the same poll shows President Obama with a high favorability rating. Another source close to Dodd said he had been well aware of his uphill battle for months. The source said his political reality was a big part the reason he decided not to seek re-election, but insisted, ""this isn't a decision forced upon him or by anyone. He was looking at his career, looking at his record of accomplishments over the past 35 years, asking what else is there."" Personal and political challenges ""have given me pause to take stock and to ask questions that too few of us in elected public life ever do: Why am I running?,"" Dodd said. Dodd's announcement came almost two years to the day that he abandoned his presidential run. He said at the time that he counted his experience on the presidential campaign trail as one of the most rewarding of his career in public service. ""It was obviously an uphill battle from the beginning, and I think that those are the times that you really see the character of the person that you are working for,"" said Taylor West, a Democratic strategist who worked on Dodd's campaign. ""He conducted that campaign in the way that I've seen him do everything else, which was with a lot of class and a lot of dedication,"" she said. West recalled Dodd's humor and his love for the people he met. ""He is someone who wears his heart on his sleeve, and that's part of the reason why people are drawn to him,"" she said. West said she looks forward to watching what Dodd can accomplish over the next year, now that he is freed up from campaign concerns. Following a disappointing showing in his presidential campaign -- getting less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses -- Dodd faced more struggles back home and in Washington. The senator was criticized last year for his role in big bonuses handed out at AIG after the insurance giant received taxpayer bailout money. AIG's Financial Products unit is based in Connecticut. Dodd initially denied having anything to do with American International Group paying out millions in bonuses, then later acknowledged his role in adding language to the stimulus bill to ensure that existing contracts for bonuses at bailout recipients, such as AIG, were honored. Dodd also faced controversy when news surfaced that he had received favorable mortgage terms from now-defunct sub-prime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial. Dodd later severed his relationship with Countrywide to avoid any appearance of impropriety. In another blow to his credibility, Dodd took heat for insisting that the government-sponsored mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were sound and failing to rein them in. The Senate Finance Committee he chairs oversees the lenders. Dodd had also received more campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than any other lawmaker, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Even with help on the trail from President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Dodd wasn't able to gain much ground in the polls. Biden last month conceded that Dodd was ""getting the living hell beat of him."" Despite his troubles, Dodd said he managed four major pieces of legislation through Congress in the past year: health care reform, credit card reform, the tobacco regulation bill and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act. Throughout his career, he's focused on children's issues, championing the Family and Medical Leave Act, working to expand the Head Start program and chairing the Children and Families subcommittee. Dodd will serve out the rest of his term, which ends in January 2011. ""This year will be a huge part of his legacy. We're looking at the likelihood that we will have an enormous piece of health care reform that his father actually introduced as a plank in the Democratic platform 60 years ago. Getting that done is going to be a huge part of his legacy,"" West said. Dodd attributes his commitment to public service and human rights to his parents, the late Sen. Thomas Dodd and Grace Murphy Dodd, according to his Senate biography. Dodd's father served in the Senate for two terms. He was censured by the Senate for financial misconduct, then lost his re-election bid in 1970. He died of a heart attack the following year. Before his career in politics, Dodd spent two years in the Peace Corps, enlisted in the Army National Guard and served in the U.S. Army Reserves. He attended Providence College and later earned a law degree from the University of Louisville. Dodd declined to speculate about what he will do when he leaves office, but he said his two daughters -- Grace, 8, and Christina, 4 -- will benefit greatly from his decision. ""I'm still driven by the same passions that motivated me to try my hand at politics so many, many years ago. And just as I've encouraged the people of Connecticut, I'm looking to the future with a spirit of optimism and confidence,"" he said. CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Dodd faced deaths of sister and Sen. Kennedy, was treated for prostate cancer last year .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Bashir Osman moves hurriedly along a white sandy beachfront, giving instructions to a driver operating a bulldozer. Near them, a large truck is ferrying away piles of rocks, clearing a sun-soaked beach lapped by the azure blue waters of the Indian Ocean. Work here is well underway as Osman presses ahead with his new multi-million dollar project: to build a luxury beach resort in Mogadishu, the capital of war-torn Somalia. ""I knew one day that Mogadishu will become peace and we'll get stability,"" says Osman, who already owns two hotels in the city. ""That is why I started to buy that land."" After more than 20 years of violence, Somalia moved a step closer to stability last September after picking its first president elected on home soil in decades. And now, hope is gradually returning to parts of the East African country. Read this: Peace concert rocks Mogadishu . Although security is still an issue, Mogadishu has been experiencing an economic renaissance in recent months, boosted by members of the diaspora returning home to rebuild the country, as well as the efforts of local businessmen who never left. Osman, who stayed in Somalia throughout its conflict, hopes his new development will attract holidaymakers from abroad. He says that he's already had American and British visitors staying in his hotels. ""More than 20 tourists they came,"" he says. ""Some of them they came with their family to show Somalia, especially Mogadishu,"" adds Osman. ""And really when they went back, they were so excited when they saw how Mogadishu looks like, how beautiful city we have, how beautiful beach we have and that is what we want to show them again and again."" Osman's ambitious new projects are part of a growing building activity that is reshaping many of the neighborhoods of bullet-ridden Mogadishu. ""If you go to Mogadishu the construction is very, very booming,"" says Osman. ""That is the sign of peace,"" he adds. ""Especially the people who came back from America and Europe, they start to open the new businesses."" Mogadishu's growing economy is manifested not just in real estate and the hotel sector. Telecommunications is also on the rise, while the aviation industry is spreading its wings too, with about 15 daily domestic and international flights. ""We have six different routes and basically next we'll be eight,"" says Osman Abdullahi, a young Somali entrepreneur who set up the ODAY express airline. ""There is a lot of airlines that are planning to (come to) this country and hoping to (have) a hub over here."" Abdullahi admits that leaving the United States in 2010 to return home and start his business was a ""100% huge risk."" He says that when moved back back to Somalia, it was too dangerous to even drive in Mogadishu. ""That picture is already gone. It's a different picture today,"" he says. This new picture can also be witnessed at Mogadishu's seaport -- Somalia's key national asset -- where creaking cranes lift goods from the commercial ships and boats lining the harbor. The wide array of imported construction materials, household goods and food are then loaded onto rows of waiting trucks. Read this: Somali women defy danger to write history . The customs revenue collected from here has increased exponentially in recent times. And while the system is far from perfect, the income is crucial to the newly formed government in rebuilding the city, whose basic infrastructure has been shattered by war. Currently, Somalia's economy is largely supported by aid from donor governments, while the relatively peaceful business environment is propped up by the African Union Mission in Somalia African (AMISOM). The security forces squeezed the al Qaeda-linked Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab out of Mogadishu, but the insurgents still lurk and periodically launch terror attacks. Read this: The global cost of Somali piracy . Brigadier Michael Ondoga, of AMISOM, told CNN recently that although Al-Shabaab was ""largely defeated"" in Mogadishu, there were still issues with its members ""melting into the population"" and taking advantage of the city's large size to hide. But Somali security forces have succeeded in pre-empting many suicide attacks and have arrested some of the Al-Shabaab operatives hiding among the capital's population. ""The situation is generally good at the moment -- the security forces are controlling it very well,"" Ondoga said. ""Here in the city now, the big guns are quiet, the streets are lit, many (in the) diaspora are coming back, new construction is going on, business is booming,"" he said. And despite the long list of challenges, Mogadishu businessmen like Osman are hopeful of a brighter future. ""For me I was here (during the conflict) and the situation I see now is a situation I have never seen before. So the situation now is getting better,"" he says.","Mogadishu, the capital of war-torn Somalia, is experiencing an economic renaissance .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Botanists believe they have discovered one of the world's largest carnivorous plants in Southeast Asia. Nepenthes northiana - the carnivorous pitcher plant prepares to tuck into a rat. The giant pitcher plants were located on Mount Victoria in Palawan, central Philippines by a team led by UK botanist Stewart McPherson. The second largest species, now called Nepenthes attenboroughii, has been named in honor of the UK's world-renowned natural history presenter Sir David Attenborough. The new discovery measures up to 30 centimeters in diameter and is formed by a tendril which inflates into a large cup-shaped trap. McPherson told CNN: ""Around the mouth of the pitcher are secretions of nectar which attracts insects and small animals. The rim has lots of waxy downward-pointing ridges which help prey fall directly into the pitcher. ""The pitchers are half full of a liquid consisting of acids and enzymes which help break down its prey."" The insectivorous, sometimes carnivorous diet is crucial for the plants' survival says McPherson. ""These plants grow in really harsh areas where soil quality is very poor -- often pure gravel or sand. Catching insects allows the plant to augment nutrients that it otherwise wouldn't have access to."" McPherson along with his colleagues Alastair Robinson and Volker Heinrich have discovered more than 20 new varieties of pitcher plant in recent expeditions and have also made two rediscoveries. One of those rediscoveries, Nepenthes deaniana, was first recorded in 1907 but was subsequently lost when the Philippine National Herbarium in Manila was bombed towards the end of World War II. McPherson and his team believe they are the first explorers to observe the plant in the wild in over a century. The Nepenthes deaniana produces a spectacular, football-sized, red pitchers that are large enough to catch insects and small animals. In many of the traps, McPherson's team found giant centipedes and 10 centimeter-long spiders. The Botanical Society of America says that there are around 600 species of pitcher plants. Most familiar, perhaps, is the Venus Flytrap. But bigger species like the Nepenthes attenboroughii, Nepenthes northaina and the world's largest known pitcher plant, Nepenthes rajah are able to capture animals as large as rats, as can be clearly seen in the picture above. ""These plants have evolved to catch insects. But on rare occasions they do catch rats and mice. The first reports of these plants catching rats was made in the 19th century by a British explorer called Spenser St John,"" McPherson said.","Botanists believe they have discovered one of the world's largest carnivorous plants .

"(CNN) -- Philip Chism, the Massachusetts teenager accused of raping and killing his algebra teacher, became visibly upset when the teacher, Colleen Ritzer, spoke about the teen's home state of Tennessee after class, according to a police affidavit unsealed Friday. A ninth grade student told investigators that she was in class with Chism and Ritzer after school on the day of the crime, the affidavit said. She said the teacher and Chism were talking about China but, at some point, Ritzer mentioned the student's home state of Tennessee. Chism became ""visibly upset,"" the student said. When Ritzer noticed that Chism was upset, she changed the subject, said the unidentified student, who described Chism as ""talking to himself."" The affidavit, in chilling detail, offers the first hint of a possible motive in last month's gruesome killing of the popular high school teacher. Ritzer, 24, was allegedly raped with an object and had her throat slashed. A handwritten note found next to her body said, ""I hate you all."" A Massachusetts grand jury on Thursday indicted Chism, 14, on charges of murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in connection with Ritzer's slaying on October 22, according to the Essex district attorney. Citing Massachusetts law, prosecutors said they would ask that Chism be tried in an adult court. ""The indictments ... detail horrific and unspeakable acts,"" District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement. Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, declined to comment. The affidavit includes testimony from eyewitnesses as well as a school video surveillance timeline showing Chism and Ritzer in the same area of the school during the teacher's final moments. In the video, Ritzer appears to enter a second-floor girls restroom -- apparently a faculty restroom was occupied -- and Chism, wearing gloves and red sweatshirt with the hood pulled over his head, appears to enter the restroom about a minute later, according to the affidavit. Shortly after, a female student enters the bathroom and quickly walks out, according to court papers. She told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes. The person's rear was exposed, with clothes piled on the floor. The video shows Chism leaving the restroom, returning later with a recycling barrel, and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead, the court papers say. He pulls the barrel outside the building and toward the student parking lot. Investigators said there are what appear to be blood stains near the bathroom as well as on Chism's pants in the video. After Chism was reported missing by his mother on the evening of October 22, police had his cellular phone company ""ping"" the location of his phone. The phone was found to be in the vicinity of the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left. The affidavit said that when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife. A search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" He was also carrying credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of woman's underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, the court papers said. Her throat was slit. The green recycling bin seen in the surveillance video was found 20 yards from the body. Clothing and other belongings were scattered near the body, along with blood soaked gloves Chism appeared to be wearing in the video. The handwritten ""I hate you all"" note was folded near her body, according to the documents. Investigators used the affidavit to secure a warrant to search Chism's home. Chism's mother, Diana, told investigators that she recently moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee amid a ""stressful divorce"" from the teen's father. Documents filed in a Tennessee court 12 years ago shed light on a troubled relationship. The court papers showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of ""prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse."" Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN in the days after the crime that the boy's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida. The suspect's mother, Diana Chism, last month released a statement through her son's attorney saying her ""heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer."" The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism, armed with a box cutter, robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. On the aggravated rape and armed robbery indictments, Chism was charged as a youthful offender, but prosecutors said they will move to join those charges with the murder case in Superior Court. ""This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family,"" Blodgett said. Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . Ritzer was known to her friends and family as a woman who inspired many -- whether in the classroom or online -- with her heart, intellect and positive spirit. ""She was happy,"" said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. ""I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought."" A 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master's degree at Salem State University, Ritzer seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school. Dressed in pink, hundreds mourn Colleen Ritzer, slain Massachusetts teacher . ""She was energetic, she was compassionate,"" Dzerkacz said. ""You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend."" The Ritzer family released a statement saying: ""We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen."" A week after the slaying, about 400 Danvers High School students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects at the church where the family of popular math teacher worshiped.","Affidavit describes chilling note allegedly left by Massachusetts teen after killing teacher .

"(CNN) -- Sorry, ""Potter"" fans, Harry himself says not to count on another film. Despite the excitement over a new ""Harry Potter"" story written by J.K.

"(CNN) -- Is there a worse city in the world to be marked out as a tourist? Maybe, but we haven't been sneered at by a waiter there yet. But you don't have to be the bumbling out of towner. Stick to a few rules (actually 11) and you'll fit right in. 1. Bone up on the latest films and exhibitions . Dinner chat in Paris is dominated by culture and opinions, so read Le Monde or Libération for the latest. Le Monde comes out around 3 p.m., so you can easily grab a copy and read the headlines en route to le diner -- nobody will pay that much attention to what you say, anyway, before interrupting. In October, you can join the strutting vernissage (opening night) of the FIAC, a contemporary art fair and annual glam gathering. In the celluloid division, be sure to mention seeing an obscure independent film at the slick MK2 Bibliothèque (French site only). 2. Sort out the coffee minefield -- fast . Always drink a Parisian espresso after lunch or dinner, never white coffee, ordering simply ""un café"" to designate the little black one. For breakfast, don't ask for soupy café au lait, but rather the stronger crème, petit or grand. A noisette (macchiato) is also standard. Unless you're in or near one of the top patisseries, croissants in cafés are often tasteless sponges. But as a Parisian you should be whippet thin, anyway, and rarely in need of bread products. To really do the coffee thing right, sit for a few hours over a black coffee, moodily flicking through a paperback or Le Monde, though in reality people-watching from behind your Ray-Bans. 3. Treat waiters as equals . Parisian waiters are professionals, not students or unemployed actors, and they expect to be treated with respect. Bark your order, make a smart insider joke (reference latest political scandal) and drop a few coins before you sweep onward. 4. Stand up to civil servants . Develop a snippy attitude toward any fonctionnaire (civil servant), who are notoriously tough, even obstructive, nuts in France. Don't be cowed -- keep the upper hand by using an assertive, informed tone. The fonctionnaire revels in the power they wield from desks on which a bottle of mineral water is firmly planted -- they believe it makes them lose weight. Their jobs are for life, and resignation is unheard of. 5. How to dress -- women . Wear primarily black, keeping a casual, just out of the sheets look by day and a more primed, predatory look by night. Accessories are key so invest heavily in shoes and watches. Perfumes follow, preferably something ethereally obscure from Dipthyque or L'Artisan Parfumeur. Kit yourself out at Merci (111 boulevard Beaumarchais, +33 01 42 77 00 33), the cult concept store near the Bastille, or at the style emporium Colette in the rue Saint Honoré (No. 213; +33 1 55 35 33 90). Adopt a younger lover for illicit coffees in the romantic backstreets of the Left Bank, and use a Vélib (hired bike) to get around, no helmet of course. 6. How to dress -- men . Like the iconic existentialist pinup, Albert Camus, turn up your (black) coat or jacket collar, stick a Gauloise in your mouth and puff away -- or pretend to. Smoking is still cool and even in deep midwinter pavement café heaters cater to the inveterate nicotine fiend, environment be damned. Serge Gainsbourg is another defunct role model, a poetic, rock 'n' roll roué who managed to sing with a cigarette drooping from his lower lip and stiff drink in hand. The Parisian celeb not to model yourself on is Johnny Hallyday, a perma-tanned crooner of beyond pensionable age. 7. Shun the suburbs . Only stay intramuros . No respectable Parisian lives outside the city, as the very word banlieue (suburb) brings shivers to their stylish souls. The faubourgs, once looked down upon as too prolo (proletarian), are now considered ultra-hip, with more space at less cost. If you decide on an extended stay, first-floor apartments with high ceilings are tops, though a fifth floor walk-up is perfectly acceptable. Kitchens aren't important, as you always eat out. 8. Learn to be a flâneur, i.e. stroll aimlessly . You need no specific goal to your day, just cruise the boulevards, bookshops and cafés or drape an arm around your girl/boyfriend on the banks of the Seine. In summer, stretch out on the sand of Paris Plages to show off your toned body and ogle others. Never stroll along the Champs Elysées, which is only for non-Parisians and people eyeing up big cars. Favored ""bo bo"" (bourgeois bohemian) ambling areas are the Marais, Canal Saint Martin and République. The Left Bank's Saint Michel is for students and tourists, while Saint Germain is for aging artists and moneyed ""intellos"" (intellectuals), à la Bernard-Henri Lévy. 9. Get something going on the side . You may not be in town long enough to pull it off, but attitudes toward sex are liberal in the extreme, so you might follow the example of Parisians who commonly have lovers. Women generally cultivate younger or married men -- the expression ""de cinq à sept"" (from 5 to 7 p.m.) refers to such after-work activities.

Never compare salaries or even refer to the exorbitant cost of a restaurant. It's bad form to check a bill -- although it's sometimes rewarding. It's worth cultivating the maître d'hôtel of a grand brasserie to be sycophantically swept to your favorite table on arrival. That's when you know you're a true Parisian. 11. Learn French . Nobody will really accept you, of course, unless you speak la langue de Molière. Once you have the basics, sprinkle them liberally with English words such as ""cool,"" ""look"" (as in a style), ""weekend,"" ""design"" and ""trench"" (not warfare, but a belted raincoat). Remember that the innate sense of ""les Anglo-Saxons"" (a catchphrase for the U.S. and UK) is negative, while ""perfide Albion"" (treacherous England) crops up regularly. Parisians nonetheless show a grudging respect for American culture and history, particularly given that the Yankees broke away from perfide Albion.

"Siem Reap, Cambodia (CNN) -- Visit Cambodia's number one tourist attraction, Angkor Wat, with the average tour guide and you'll probably leave the UNESCO World Heritage Site with your head swimming in dates, dimensions and unpronounceable names of kings. Jaya-who? You might also get the impression, as I did when I first visited two years ago, that the magnificent temple complex you scrambled around in sweltering heat is confined within its sturdy walls and scenic moat, and the city ended there. Turns out that's not the case. A new report released by the U.S.-based National Academy of Sciences (NAS) highlighting the results of an April 2012 airborne laser survey -- the first of its kind in Asia, covering 370 square kilometers of northwest Cambodia's Khmer Empire archaeological sites -- has revealed a much grander Angkor landscape, one without parallel in the pre-industrial world. Even more sensational, the June announcement of the findings confirmed the existence of a huge medieval city buried beneath impenetrable jungle on a remote mountain. Re-writing Cambodia's history books . Angkor was the capital of the Khmer Empire, which was founded in 802 AD on Mount Kulen when Jayavarman II was declared universal monarch. These days the most popular Angkor sites for tourists are Angkor Thom, which is home to Bayon and its massive carved smiling faces; magnificent Angkor Wat; and smaller temples such as Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, Pre Rup and Ta Nei. But the precise data gathered by LiDAR, a remote sensing laser instrument, reveals that Angkor was actually a monumental, formally planned and low-density mega-city. Less visited ruins further afield, such as enchanting Beng Mealea, 52 kilometers from Siem Reap and sprawling Koh Ker, some 120 kilometers away, were actually satellite cities within Angkor's colossal urban network. Phnom Kulen, or Mount Kulen, meanwhile, 48 kilometers north of Siem Reap, has been identified as the location of the medieval city of Mahendraparvata, or the Mountain of Indra -- King of the Gods. This makes Angkor the world's largest urban conurbation prior to Britain's 18th-century Industrial Revolution -- a revelation that completely alters how experts are looking at the area. While the ancient urban network's existence was mentioned in inscriptions and long suspected by French archaeologists working in Cambodia, it couldn't be confirmed due to the remoteness of ruins already discovered on the plateau, the inaccessibility of much of the mountain and the existence of landmines installed by the Khmer Rouge. 10-step guide to Siem Reap . One of the authors of the NAS report, Australian archaeologist Dr. Damian Evans, is director of the University of Sydney's Robert Christie Research Centre in Siem Reap and the chief architect behind the costly LiDAR mission. He brought together eight different archaeological organizations, including the Cambodian government's APSARA Authority, which manages the region's archaeological sites, to form the Khmer Archeology LiDAR Consortium, which raised funds for the project and shared data. The LiDAR mission was conceived to fill in the blank spaces on the map of Angkor, Evans says, as we slip into the jungle just outside the walls of Angkor Wat. ""Nothing on the forest floor is random, not even a termite mound,"" Evans explains as he points out anthills. ""While a lot of the city is buried beneath the ground, it impacts the surface in subtle ways. The movements, activities and actions of these people hundreds of years ago remain inscribed into the landscape. ""None of these lumps and bumps and dips made any kind of sense, but once you see the LiDAR imagery, it's strikingly evident that what you're looking at are the remains of a city associated with Angkor Wat."" Using technology to speed things up . Out of the sight of the one million tourists who visit the temple-city every year, archaeologists are at work on excavation projects. They use found remnants of the region's rich Khmer history, culture and way of life to piece together a story that's continually developing, changing visitors' understanding and experience of Angkor in the process. Archaeologists have worked on the ground here since naturalist Henri Mouhot stumbled upon Angkor Wat in 1860, excavating temple ruins deep within jungles for visitors to tour, peeling away vines from palaces for us to explore and unearthing riches to be displayed in museums. For many archaeologists, a discovery can represent a lifetime's work. The LiDAR technology changes all that, speeding up the process. ""What LiDAR takes away is a little of the Indiana Jones stuff of whacking through cactus, spiders, thorny trees and mud puddles,"" says American archaeologist Dr. Miriam Stark, onsite in Siem Reap. ""You can still have your spiders, snakes and bugs, and all those rich experiences, but now you know you're getting somewhere, which is a lot more satisfying."" A taste of that Indiana Jones stuff awaits our party at 492-meter-high Mount Kulen, a 90-minute drive from Siem Reap. Near Preah Ang Thom, home to a colossal 16th-century reclining Buddha carved out of solid rock, my photographer husband and I swap our four-wheel-drive vehicle for motorbikes, riding behind local guides for a daylong bone-rattling exploration of the eight-kilometer-wide and 32-kilometer-long mountain plateau. We cling on tight as our guides, familiar with every cave and cranny on the landmine-riddled mountain, tackle muddy trails up hills, bump over log bridges, fly through fast-flowing streams, get stuck in sludgy puddles and go off-road, bouncing along jungle tracks only they can see, every now and again alighting to slash away vines and branches with a scythe to create our own paths. We hike to see enormous carved stone statues of an elephant and lions at Sras Damrei (Elephant Pond) buried deep within the forest and scramble about the ruins of Prasat Rong Chen, the three-tiered laterite temple where the Brahman priest made Jayavarman II a god-king. We emerge from thick jungle to gaze at the red brick temple of O Paong, grass and trees sprouting from its cracks. Another day we visit beautiful Beng Mealea, taken captive by tangled roots and a forest that grows within and around the moss-covered temple, and the remote, sprawling Koh Ker, where temple after crumbling temple wait to be explored. We see a total of four tourists the whole day. Insider Guide: Best of Cambodia . ""Digging"" for ruins in the air . We also board the helicopter that was equipped with the LiDAR instrument to view the area's splendid temple-cities and grasp the size of the colossal new cityscape that's been recently uncovered. From the air it's easier to understand how challenging the archaeologists' job must have been before the device bombarded the ground with laser beams -- a million pulses every four seconds -- to record data that ultimately provided the precise information that has forever changed how archaeologists work. At a traditional Khmer stilted house on Siem Reap's riverside that serves as the Robert Christie Research Centre, I meet archeology professor Dr. Roland Fletcher, co-director of the Greater Angkor Project. ""I like to explain it like this,"" begins Dr. Fletcher. ""When you came here you landed at the airport and thought of yourself as driving to Siem Reap, then driving from Siem Reap to Angkor. But when you were at the airport you were really 15 kilometers inside the Angkor city and Siem Reap is in the suburbs of Angkor ... at Angkor Wat you'd be right in the middle of the city and everywhere you turned you would be looking across rice fields and see rows and rows of timber houses with smoke rising from them in the morning and the towers of shrines sticking up through the trees ... it must have been an unbelievably beautiful place."" It's still a beautiful place -- as the one million tourists who visited Siem Reap and its Angkor temple-cities in 2012 would no doubt attest. And hotel and tour operators are predicting a significant increase in tourist arrivals for 2013. It could be some time before more of the ""lost city"" of Mahendraparvata's sites are excavated and its temples are made more accessible -- there's still much de-mining to do on the plateau, too. In the meantime, however, locals are hoping the new discoveries inspire more travelers to explore remote sites such as Koh Ker and Beng Mealea, and that the intrepid will hop on the backs of motorbikes at Mount Kulen. Getting there . Several airlines fly directly to Siem Reap in Cambodia and 30-day tourist visas are available upon arrival for many nationalities for $20. Bring passport photos. Most visitors employ a local guide or hire a tuk-tuk or bikes to explore the Angkor Archaeological Park (open daily, 5 a.m.-6 p.m.). An Angkor Pass can be purchased at the entrance gate: one-day $20, three-day $40 and seven-day $60. ABOUTAsia Travel offers tours of the Angkor cities. Backyard Travel offers one-day expeditions to Mount Kulen and day trips Koh Ker and Beng Mealea.

"(CNN) -- A former cast member of ""Ice Road Truckers: Deadliest Roads"" allegedly kidnapped a prostitute in Las Vegas, a police report said. Tim Zickuhr, who appeared as a driver in episodes of the History Channel show in 2011, was arrested on kidnapping, extortion and coercion charges by Las Vegas police on December 19. The matter is just coming to light publicly this week. The arrest report describes a bizarre dispute between Zickuhr, 35, and Lisa Cadeau, described as a prostitute who works under the name ""Snow White."" It began after he allowed her to use his bank ATM card to withdraw cash to pay for sexual services, the report said. He allegedly became upset later when he suspected she took more money than she was supposed to get out of the account, the document showed. ""Cadeau was then locked inside a closet tied up and was instructed to give 'Tim' someone's phone number who could bring him the money that she owed him,"" the police report said. Zickuhr did not realize the number was to a police cell phone given to her by an officer she knew as a ""citizen source."" The officer wrote that when he answered the phone, Zickuhr allegedy ""told me that he currently had 'Snow White' and if I didn't bring $1,000 to a phone booth at Lynwood/Sahara he was going to go to Mexico to kill 'Snow White.'"" Several other calls followed before the officer found Zickuhr and Cadeau behind a Las Vegas casino, where he arrested Zickuhr, the report said. Zickuhr told the officer that ""his plan was to place Cadeau on (Craigslist) and attempt to make money off her performing sexual acts,"" the report said. ""I wasn't going to let her go till she gave me what she owed me,"" the report quotes Zickuhr as saying. Zickuhr's lawyer Roy Nelson told CNN Tuesday that his client ""maintains his innocence to any criminal wrongdoing."" ""It is our understanding that the alleged victim has major credibility issues, and we are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the events,"" Nelson said. ""These are certainly serious allegations but there are just as serious questions as to this witness' credibility and her version of events."" A History Channel spokesman had no comment when asked by CNN for a response to the incident. It was noted, however, that Zickuhr had not appeared on the show since its second season. Zickuhr's due in court in May. CNN's Joan Yeam contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The alleged victim has major credibility issues,"" Zickuhr's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Silent and shadowy, two hulks lie under the Gulf of Mexico's warm waters, unmoved since their deadly encounter 72 years ago during World War II. Now, the future has come to take a closer look. From July 6 to 14, the 211-foot research ship Exploration Vessel Nautilus conducted dives to the final resting places of the American steamer SS Robert E. Lee and the German U-boat U-166, about 45 miles south of the Mississippi River delta. The Robert E. Lee was torpedoed by the U-166 while ferrying victims of other U-boat attacks from Trinidad to New Orleans. The sub succumbed to depth charges fired from an escort ship. These doomed ships are now separated by only two miles of seabed. The Nautilus is operated by the Ocean Exploration Trust, a research group founded in 2008 for the purpose of carrying out ""pure ocean exploration,"" according to the group's website. The ship carries 17 permanent crew members and a rotating, 31-member Corps of Exploration composed of scientists, engineers and other special personnel. It also holds two remotely operated vehicles, Hercules and Argus, which collect data and samples from deep beneath the ocean's surface. The purpose of the Nautilus' mission to the twin shipwrecks was to perform forensic archeological documentation to more clearly understand their demises, said Ocean Exploration Trust spokeswoman Susan Poulton. By the time the team was finished, it had conducted high-resolution mapping of the area and created 3-D images of the wrecks. Assisted by the recent findings, archeologists have been able to supplement what they already knew about the attack, Poulton added. ""On July 30th, 1942 at 10:30 p.m., a torpedo from U-166 hit the [Robert E. Lee], which took about 15 minutes to sink. One officer, nine crewmen, and 15 passengers died as the vessel went down,"" according to an article on the Nautilus Live website. ""Once the torpedo was sighted, the passenger ship's armed escort vessel, PC-566, dropped several depth charges. ... those depth charges sank the U-boat with all hands."" Fifty-two crew members went down with the U-boat, according to an article on the U.S. Coast Guard's website. This sort of Nazi incursion into American waters was perhaps more ubiquitous than modern Americans believe. ""Historians say U-boats sank at least 50 American ships in the Gulf, one in the very mouth of the Mississippi River. Americans managed to sink only one U-boat in the Gulf of Mexico,"" said Poulton. The nature of these wrecks as war graves is not taken lightly by the researchers on the Nautilus, according to Poulton, who quoted the founder of the Ocean Exploration Trust, Robert Ballard, as saying, ""Many souls were lost on these wrecks and others, but now they are teeming with corals and undersea creatures. It's the amazing tapestry of life."" The Nautilus will continue its expedition in the Gulf by examining the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and is expected to complete its cruise in early October. The mission's progress can be tracked live at the Nautilus Live website. Researchers in Hawaii find lost Japanese WWII megasub .

"(CNN) -- Yosemite National Park has closed its famous Half Dome as a 4,532-acre wildfire burned nearly uncontrollably Wednesday, officials said. The park in California remains open to the public, who may be able to see heavy smoke in the morning, which clears by afternoon, said Scott Gediman, a National Park Service spokesman at Yosemite. The fire grew from 700 acres on Monday. ""Except for some smoke, it's really not affecting people's visits,"" Gediman said. ""Hiking trails are still open, camp grounds are full, and it's still a great time to visit Yosemite."" Several hiking trails remained closed, and the park service wasn't issuing its usual 300 permits a day to hikers seeking to climb Half Dome, Gediman said. Officials are working to reopen Half Dome in ""a couple of days,"" he said. The so-called Meadow Fire began July 19 because of ""hot shot fires"" caused by lighting, Gediman said. As of Wednesday, firefighters contained only 10% of the fire, he said. Sharlene Simonson, 24, a photography student at the City College in San Francisco, was on top of Sentinel Dome with her family on Saturday, and they saw a small line of smoke wafting near Half Dome, she said Wednesday. They then witnessed the fire engulf Half Dome on Sunday, she said. ""Seeing the plume of smoke the next day completely overpower the glory of Half Dome put us in complete awe at its extending reach,"" said Simonson, who posted photos of the fire on her CNN iReport page. The park service hopes to have the peak reopened in the next couple of days, Gediman said. On Sunday, the rapid spread of the fire caused nearly 100 hikers and backpackers to be evacuated from the park, and an additional 85 hikers and climbers were evacuated by helicopter from the summit of Half Dome, the park service said. Gediman wants park-goers and prospective campers to know that Yosemite remains open and that most of the areas that people come to visit are still functioning. ""I feel confident the fire activity is diminishing,"" he said. The fire is within Little Yosemite Valley between Half Dome and Mount Starr King on both sides of the Merced River, the park service said.

"(CNN)  -- After five years of trying to date girls and to conform and conceal his sexuality, 18-year-old Steven Field told his friends and family that he was gay. Steven Field, now 25, came out to his friends and family when he was 18. ""I wasn't being honest to myself,"" Field, now 25, said of his closeted high school years in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. Being gay was natural for him, Field, who lives in Washington, said in a Thursday phone interview. ""I didn't choose to be gay anymore than straight people choose to be straight."" To those who would disagree with him, Field said, ""You don't choose who you love."" Field is not alone in thinking that sexual orientation is a fixed element of a person. Whether homosexuality is innate or whether it is acquired -- the age-old nature versus nurture debate -- has long shaped the political and social discussion over gay rights. Over the years, the genetically based argument has found increasing support among Americans, according to polls. More and more people now believe that homosexuality is a permanent, immutable part of a person, much like fingerprints or eye color. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Wednesday, 56 percent of Americans believe that gays and lesbians could not change their sexual orientation even if they wanted to do so -- the first time that a majority has held that belief regarding homosexuality since CNN first posed the question nearly 10 years ago. The sampling error for the results is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Six years ago, 45 percent of Americans responding to a CNN/USA/Gallup Poll said gays and lesbians could not change their sexual orientation. And in 1998, the number was 36 percent, according to a CNN/Time poll. The latest poll results affirmed what many gay and lesbians see as a shift in attitude across the country toward homosexuality. Even in the face of state legislation that denies gays the right to marry or to form civil unions, more Americans are now accepting of homosexuality, gays and lesbians say. For the Rev. Mel White, the founder and president of faith-based gay rights group Soulforce, the poll results were a ""tremendous relief."" ""The poll is such good news,"" White said Thursday. ""Over half of America thinks we don't have to be healed from a sickness; suddenly we are OK as we are.""  Watch gay homeless teens » . The change in thinking among Americans can be attributed to more and more people getting to know gays and lesbians as they come out, White said. ""Once they know us, they will support us,"" he said, adding that the idea extended to faith-based organizations that currently oppose gay rights, White said. White, once a ghostwriter for the Revs. Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Billy Graham before coming out in a public sermon in 1993, said the church was the barrier to nationwide acceptance of gays and lesbians. ""Until the church changes, this debate will go on and on and on,"" he said. ""Once the church changes, it'll be over."" But for organizations that say gays and lesbians can become straight, the poll results were discouraging. This ""shows that our reach is not as great as the mainstream media and entertainment industry,"" said Peter Sprigg, vice president for policy for the Family Research Council. ""People are believing what they are hearing, and it's not the truth,"" he said, adding that it was disappointing Americans had succumbed to what he called a ""myth"" that gays and lesbians cannot change. They can change, but it is difficult, he said. For gay and lesbian organizations, the poll results came as affirmation for the work they do. ""We were really excited to see it,"" Jean-Marie Navetta, director of communications for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, or PFLAG, said of the poll. ""It's good to see that this message [being gay is not a choice] is moving to a large number of Americans."" Navetta said she and other PFLAG employees had sensed a swing in attitude toward gays and lesbians. ""There are more people that are out as well as [straight] allies that are out,"" she said, explaining the shift. When people realize ""this is about your neighbors and co-workers and friends and family ... the issue becomes a person,"" she said. Melissa Fryrear, director of gender issues for Focus on the Family, said she found the results unfortunate -- not only because they run counter to the beliefs of her group but to her personal experience as well. ""I know that homosexuality can be overcome because that's the story of my life,"" she said. Fryrear said she lived as a lesbian for nearly a decade before becoming a Christian and later ""overcoming"" her homosexuality through a long process of change and self-examination. ""I'm changed. I'm a heterosexual woman now. I'm not sexually attracted to women. I am romantically and sexually attracted to men."" Like Sprigg, Fryrear attributed the poll's results, at least partly, to the media's coverage of the issue. ""The truth that people can change has not been represented oftentimes correctly and fairly in the media,"" she said. However, she said, people who want to try and become heterosexual would not be dissuaded by those do not believe change is possible. ""They're going to make that personal decision to overcome homosexuality regardless,"" she said. According to the poll released Wednesday, 36 percent of Americans agree with Fryrear and Sprigg that gays and lesbians can change their sexual orientation. For Field, the issue of whether he can change or not is irrelevant. ""I think it's important for everyone to be true to themselves,"" he said. ""This is who I am and I'm proud of it.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The meltdowns of three reactors at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant may have happened more than two years ago, but the disaster remains a giant, unresolved mess. An earthquake in 2011 triggered a tsunami which slammed into the plant, disabling it. The threat of radiation forced neighbors to evacuate and many still can't return to their homes. Authorities face many challenges before they can make the facility safe again for the long term. Explainer: Fukushima update . Here are five of the biggest questions still out there: . 1. How dangerous for your health is Fukushima? Data published in August shows 44 out of 216,809 children under age 18 in Fukushima prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid cancer or suspected of having the disease. The figure is far higher than the international average but opinions are split as to whether this is because of the nuclear accident or because of more sensitive screening. Also, health experts say it takes years after radiation exposure to develop thyroid cancer, which suggests the cause of the cancer may predate the tsunami. Read more about Fukushima health effects . 2. What can you do with radioactive water? The most immediate problem for plant operator Tepco is the hundreds of tons of water poured over the damaged nuclear reactors every single day to keep the molten fuel cool. If the fuel is not kept cool, it could cause another disaster. That radioactive water then needs to be stored safely. But several on-site water storage tanks that were originally designed to be temporary have sprung leaks. Tepco said last summer that as much as 300 tons of toxic groundwater was seeping into the Pacific Ocean every day, sparking fears about radioactive contamination of fish, which are a major food source. Read more about the leaks . More about Japanese-spawned tuna caught off the U.S. 3. Is it safe to remove spent fuel rods? Tepco is just days away from starting to remove 1,500 irradiated spent fuel rods from a pool in reactor number 4 to a safer location. The building was damaged by a hydrogen blast after the disaster. Removing fuel from a severely damaged pool has never been attempted. Critics fear the building is unstable and any mistake could cause a new nuclear disaster. Read more about removing the fuel rods . 4. How do you remove molten fuel in melted down reactors? The radiation levels in reactors 1, 2 and 3 are so high that the area is inaccessible to humans. No one knows for sure where the molten core is resting within the basements of the buildings and how far it has penetrated through their floors. The technology does not exist to remove this molten fuel. 5. How do you stop running out of skilled labor? Workers within the Fukushima nuclear power plant have a radiation exposure limit. Once they reach this limit they can no longer work on site and new workers need to be found. As time goes on, more experienced workers will reach their exposure limits, sparking concerns that available workers will have decreased skill levels.","Fukushima officials must figure out what to do with increasing amounts of radioactive water .

"Washington (CNN) -- The last time Hillary Clinton was in Iowa, she was limping away from a disappointing third-place finish in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. Republicans would like that memory of Clinton to stay. The Republican National Committee is starting a concerted effort Friday to remind their supporters and reporters who will be covering Clinton in Iowa that the Hawkeye State has not always been friendly to the former secretary of state and first lady. ""As we have seen with her nose dive in the polls, the more Hillary turns to politics the less Americans like her,"" RNC spokesman Kirsten Kukowski said in a statement. ""It's awkward considering she's headed back to Iowa, the scene of her most stinging defeat."" Clinton will return to Iowa on Sunday for the politically important Harkin Steak Fry, put on by longtime Sen. Tom Harkin. Thousands of guests expect to listen to her speak, flip steaks and honor Harkin, the liberal senator who is retiring after 2014. The event is the biggest foray Clinton has made into politics since leaving the State Department in 2013. The steak fry is widely considered a must-stop for Democrats considering a run at the presidency. Organizers are expecting upward of 5,000 people and more than 150 journalists to attend. Hillary Clinton to decide on 2016 run around end of year . Clinton supporters push back against the idea that there are bad memories for her in Iowa. ""While Republicans continue to bicker, Hillary Clinton is focused on celebrating her good friend and former colleague, Sen. Harkin, and on helping candidates in Iowa get elected in 2014 who share in the Democrats' vision for the future,"" said Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for Correct the Record, an outside communications group defending Clinton. But the RNC doesn't want Clinton to have a free weekend in Iowa. The group will be sending lawmakers and Republican surrogates a research document Friday that lays out part of Clinton's history in Iowa. Titled ""Hillary's Hawkeye Return,"" the document focuses on Clinton's 2008 Iowa campaign. During that hard-fought presidential caucus, Clinton finished a disappointing third behind then-Sens. Barack Obama and John Edwards, with 29% of the vote. Obama won the caucus with 37.6%. Would Hillary Clinton top Chris Christie in New Jersey? In addition to the talking points and research document, the RNC will release a Web video on Friday called ""#AwkwardInIowa."" ""Hillary Clinton is headed to Iowa for the first time since 2008,"" reads the on-screen text atop clips of negative news coverage of the night Clinton lost. ""Bad memories for Hillary."" Despite Republican hopes, Clinton's favorability in Iowa has rebounded since 2008. A new CNN/ORC poll finds that 53% of all registered Democrats contacted in Iowa said they would support Clinton if the 2016 caucuses were held today. That number far outpaces Vice President Joe Biden's 15%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts got 7% in the poll, and 5% would pick Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.

"(CNN) -- Forget Point Break's party animals, modern surfing is more about professionalism. That's the mantra of reigning women's world champion Stephanie Gilmore, who raises an eyebrow at the mention of the famous film that became a seismic signpost for surfing in the early 1990s. The 25-year-old Australian says the seaside sphere she inhabits is a world away from the society showcased by Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, stuffed with wavy-haired folk who all referred to each other as ""dudes."" ""The biggest misconception about surfers is they all talk the surf lingo,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""Not everybody does and I think Hollywood portrays a pretty scary image of how surfers go about their language. Not all of us talk like that. ""It's probably been 30 years now that it has been a professional sport and it hasn't grown too much. But now it's really turned into this phase where it's about treating the surfers as professional athletes and not just party animals. ""The industry boomed for so long, then it finally plateaued and crashed and right now it's in a phase of rebuilding itself, trying to get back to its core and really find that market again that everybody loves so much -- the surfing brands, the industry."" If the world of professional surfing seems impossibly glamorous and cool, that's probably because the reality matches. Gilmore has struck upon a career that embraces her passion for boarding, traveling the globe and riding waves in some spectacular locations. Her emergence into the world of surfing was pretty spectacular too, as she clinched the ASP Women's World Championship title in her rookie year back in 2007. She went on to defend her crown for the next three years, regaining it in 2012 after missing out in 2011. Gilmore is fifth in the 2013 standings after four events, in Australia and New Zealand, with meets in Brazil, France and California still to come. ""This is a dream life,"" she beams. ""I am not going to lie, and most professional surfers will tell you that to imagine being paid to travel the world and do something that you absolutely love every day is better than anything. ""I always say that to someone, they always say, 'Why are you so happy all the time?' Well, if you had my job you'd be pretty happy too."" While her prowess has driven her to the very top of the sport, she's not a fan of the daredevil form of her art, exemplified by the likes of Garret McNamara, who recently surfed a wave reported to be 100 feet in height. ""My biggest fear would have to be giant waves,"" she revealed. ""It's probably not the best fear to have in my work! A giant wave is big like 30-40 foot. ""It's scary but it's something that, hopefully, I'll push myself to get into one day but right now I am just enjoying high-performance surfing in smaller waves."" It hasn't all been plain sailing for the New South Wales native, who cut her surfing teeth on Australia's glorious Gold Coast, where she still lives and trains today. Gilmore and her fellow female professionals have had to swim against the tide for long periods in what has traditionally been a male-dominated sporting environment. But with standards improving and competition at the very top intensifying, she thinks they have a product which can grow the sport internationally and attract even more women into the water, board in hand. ""Growing up a female surfer in a very male-dominated industry I think has been hard,"" she explained. ""Female surfers in the very beginning really struggled to fight for their respect and the positions they deserved. ""I think the last five to 10 years, the women have really blossomed and shown they are not here to compete against the men, they are not here to take anything away from the men. ""We're just here to surf alongside them and show that we're learning as much as they are and we're growing female surfing. ""Every single day I paddle out there's a lot more girls out there and you see that the market is growing. To watch a girl ride a wave is just a beautiful thing. ""Female surfing in a professional sense, all the girls on tour -- they're fresh faced, they speak well, it's a beautiful product -- and I feel like these next few years are going to be about harnessing that product and then showing it to the world in the right way."" Though they are fiercely competitive on the ocean waves, Gilmore says the current crop of females on the ASP tour have formed a close bond away from the beach. ""On the women's tour there are only 17 of us, so in a sense we're a family traveling the world,"" she said. ""We're all young girls that love to be girls and we're really good friends but at the same time we have to paddle out and try and be assertive and really focus to beat each other. ""Whatever happens in the water happens in the water and then we bring it back to land and we can celebrate together and enjoy it.""","Australian Stephanie Gilmore is a five-time women's surfing world champion .

"(CNN) -- Are stars just like us? It doesn't feel that way when gazing at some celebrity's multimillion-dollar estate through the window of a star-map tour bus. But thanks to the rise of peer-to-peer vacation rental sites, staying in a legend's current or former home is now sometimes just a click away. These properties offer travelers the chance to live vicariously—and, sure, lavishly. Staying in a house with ties to big names like actor Denzel Washington, rock star Jim Morrison, or celebrity cook Paula Deen also comes with vacation-rental perks like private pools, gourmet kitchens, and ample square footage. Some celebrities keep their rentals on the market year round, while others are getting savvy about choosing when to seize the moment. In June, timed to the World Cup, soccer star Ronaldinho rented out his Rio de Janeiro mansion for $15,000 on Airbnb.com and touted it on Facebook. Musician Kevin Jonas (of the Jonas Brothers) made headlines earlier in 2014 when he put up his New Jersey home for rent during Super Bowl XLVIII. ""At the end of the day, celebrities are just like everyone else and have an interest in making their investments work for them,"" says Jon Gray, senior vice president of HomeAway.com. ""If they have an empty property that they rarely use, why not make money on it?"" Such is the case for novelist Anne Rice, who rents out her 5,000-square-foot Florida beach house. Tenants get to spend days in the rooms where she used to write—and experience her sense of style. ""Certainly the lavish furnishings reflect my love of the baroque,"" she admits. ""It's the overall aesthetic that may engulf a guest and make him or her think of my books. I'm glad people are able to enjoy my home now the way I once enjoyed it all the time."" New rental site Elite Luxury Homes lists only A-listers' properties, handpicked by owner Martin Beaurivage, previously of CAA—a talent agency that signs million-dollar contracts with boldface entertainers. His site now allows the general public to book vacations in unforgettable dream homes, although its exclusive listings mostly avoid name-dropping. ""We've found most celebrities are quite private and don't make it public when one of their properties is available for rent,"" agrees Gray. ""However, those who do put their name out there are able to generate more interest and, ultimately, more bookings."" Travel + Leisure: The World's Best Hotels . Willem Dafoe: Hudson Valley, New York . Like Oscar-winning actor Willem Dafoe, you may find it tough to resist the Rubber House, an architectural gem built in 1981 for choreographer Eugene Loring. It's full of striking design details like a vaulted glass chef's kitchen and a glass-atrium walkway. In an Interview magazine story, Dafoe said: ""I was looking for a house upstate, something rustic, like an old farmhouse. This was the first place my real estate agent took me to see, and I was annoyed because the Rubber House was clearly not what I had said I was looking for. But as I continued to search, I kept returning to have another look. Visit by visit, I was seduced, and I finally bought it."" Dafoe eventually sold it in 2008, and now vacationers can rent the 1,949-square-foot, two-bedroom home.

"(CNN) -- A decade ago, they zoomed down the futuristic highways of science fiction film Minority Report. Now, driverless cars may be coming to the roads of the real world. Driverless cars have long been the realm of fantasy, but the boss of one of the world's largest auto makers says they could hit showrooms within the next 10 years. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan, told CNN's Max Foster that the company is targeting a ""totally autonomous"" car by 2020. Read more: Euro pioneer: Europe would have suffered without single currency . Ghosn said that a car with artificial intelligence would be ""a huge advantage,"" allowing people to use the time saved in commuting to be more productive. ""People on average in the world spend two hours in a car per day,"" he said. Ghosn added that consumers will be able to use the commute to teach their children or consult with their doctor while being chauffeured around in their cars.

Nissan plans to showcase its autonomous vehicle technology at the Tokyo Motor Show when it opens to the public on November 23. Investing for the future . Qashqai sales are a rare glimmer of growth in a European car market that is trying to recover after the 2008 financial crisis.

"(CNN) -- For the better part of a decade, superheroes on the big screen have been big business (""Iron Man 2"" the most recent example). On TV, however, keeping audiences coming back each week for the exploits of those with superpowers has been a far trickier task. It's been a long time since ""Batman,"" ""Wonder Woman,"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""The Greatest American Hero"" hit prime time. One show that has been able to get it right is ""Smallville,"" which begins its record-breaking tenth season Friday night on the CW (that would be the longest consecutively running sci-fi show). What began as a revised history of Superman's teen years in Smallville has come a long way over the years, with Clark Kent fighting crime in Metropolis as a rarely-seen hero called ""The Blur,"" the introduction of Lois Lane, and other superheroes occasionally joining the fray. At the same time, what was once one of the highest-rated dramas on TV, ""Heroes,"" progressively lost viewers, ending its run on NBC after four seasons. But that doesn't mean that networks are giving up on the genre: two more series, one with a caped crusader and another about a superheroic family are coming soon. So what are some of the secrets to success for superhero TV? We asked producers and cast members of some of these series to find out. 1. Make your superheroes believable . When ""Smallville"" started, the writers had a slogan: ""No flights, no tights."" Their version of Clark Kent wouldn't take up the mantle of Superman, or even Superboy. Instead the WB-turned-CW series would focus on human drama. Executive producer Brian Peterson said, ""[Series creators Al Gough and Miles Millar] created a world you could see walking into every week. Even though we're in Metropolis and we're really touching on the Superman world, it's still a world where you can see yourself having coffee with the characters."" ""It started out being about a family in Kansas struggling to make ends meet,"" added fellow executive producer Kelly Souders. ""We always emphasize the emotions. At its heart, I hope it would touch people and give them a place to come home to."" Despite appearances by more and more characters wearing elaborate costumes (Green Arrow and Hawkman, for example), Peterson and Souders say that they have always grounded the show in a real place. ""We all could relate to the Clark at the start of the show,"" said Peterson. ""It's great to watch that kid see people in costumes and see people flying with wings, as he interacts with them and we see that in his eyes."" Another show that hopes to emphasize the humanity in the superhuman (without costumes as well) is ABC's new series ""No Ordinary Family"" (premiering September 28). In it, Michael Chiklis and Julie Benz play the heads of a family who find themselves having been granted extraordinary powers following an accident. Back in July, Chiklis described it as ""a family show wrapped in a police procedural wrapped in the superhero genre."" ""The first season should feel like the first act of a superhero movie,"" said ""Family"" producer Zack Estrin. ""The slow discovery of what it means, and how it affects your real life... like yes, I can run fast, but I can also make breakfast fast! You can have the fun stuff in conjunction with the danger."" ""Family"" co-creator Jon Feldman explained that they wanted their show to have no costumes (at first), either: ""I think the goal is, what if it happened to us?"" he said. ""There's so many things that in the real version of a person getting his abilities, the costume seems like something that would be in the future. The costumes, if they ever did show up, would come much later."" 2. Give the characters a good origin . Tim Kring, who created the NBC series ""Heroes,""  certainly agrees about making the characters relatable. ""I was mainly interested in the idea of powers and how people wrestled with and dealt with the idea of discovery of something new,"" he said. ""To me the origin story is in many ways the most fascinating part of it."" Viewers agreed, as the show's first season was one of NBC's biggest hits at the time. ""There was that kind of transparency between your life and characters on the show. Our characters really didn't live heightened lives and their world didn't have that kind of gothic-y look,"" he said. ""They were very much like us. For me that was the important thing."" NBC has another series inspired by comic books on the horizon, and its main character also has an intriguing backstory. ""The Cape,"" premiering early next year, is about an innocent man falsely accused of a crime, and seemingly killed while running from the authorities. Instead he goes into hiding and takes on the guise of the Cape, a comic book hero whom his son idolizes. Actor Dorian Missick described the show as being ""in the tradition of crime drama that just takes place in this fantastic world. It's based in reality, and that helps you believe in what's going on a little more."" 3. Don't try to be ""Lost"" (or ""Heroes"") Jeph Loeb, one of the best known comic book writers in the business, was named the head of Marvel television back in June. He's quite suited for the role, having had a hand in the TV series ""Lost"" and ""Heroes."" Both shows had long story arcs that ran over an entire season, or longer. However, when it comes to the shows Loeb hopes to bring to TV, he doesn't plan to follow that tradition. ""What we've talked about is more of the model on 'Smallville.' It may have had an overriding arc, but it was more of the emotional arcs that we were following,"" he said. ""We want to start each show with a problem, and resolve that problem at the end of the episode. Whatever the emotional arc is going on, that's what you care about. If you don't care about characters, you're not gonna care about the show. We don't want a show driven by the plot, we want a show driven by the character."" 4. Never underestimate the importance of villains . For many fans, Sylar was the most intriguing character on ""Heroes."" Villains came and went but Sylar, a serial killer driven by the overwhelming desire to acquire more supernatural powers, was a constant (and Zachary Quinto's performance earned him the opportunity to play the iconic Spock in the 2009 ""Star Trek"" movie). On ""Smallville,"" each season has seen bigger and bigger villains, from Lex Luthor, to Brainiac, General Zod, and this season, Darkseid. So, for an up-and-coming series like ""The Cape,"" the villains were seen as extremely important. ""I want to create a classic 'rogues gallery' like Spider-Man or Batman's,"" said series creator Thomas Wheeler. In the first episode, he introduces two by the names of Chess and Scales. However, Wheeler says he won't overdo it. ""In 12 episodes, you won't see 12 new villains. You gotta roll out your villains, and make sure they're solid before you bring them in."" ""No Ordinary Family"" producers hinted that the family will come up against a major villain as the first season goes along as well. 5. Keep it simple . When asked to share advice for producers of superhero programs like Wheeler, Estrin and Feldman, ""Heroes'"" Kring said, ""My advice would be stay away from time travel."" (Indeed, some ""Heroes"" fans felt that some of the overly complex aspects of the show as it went on may have played a hand in its loss of viewership over the years.) ""Having spent a couple thousand hours, probably, in the writers' room trying to figure out the rules of time travel, I would caution anybody to stay away from that idea."" ""You really can't do anything that's wholly unique in the superpower genre,"" Kring said. ""Every power has been thought of. Coming up with a brand new power is not really the ultimate goal anymore. I'm just fascinated to see how these new shows explore the genre.""","Producers, writers say make the heroes believable .
Give the characters a good backstory .
Give the time travel gimmick a rest, says Kring ."
"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, the idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory was not nearly so strange a notion as it might seem to be today. People invested in their memories, in laboriously furnishing their minds. Over the last few millennia, we've invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the printed book to the photograph to the iPhone -- that have made it easier and easier for us to externalize our memories and essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. These technologies have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us. They've changed us culturally, and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively. Having little need to remember anymore, it sometimes seems as if we've forgotten how. One of the last places where you still find people passionate about the idea of a disciplined, cultivated memory is a strange contest held each spring in New York called the USA Memory Championship. Contestants compete to see who can memorize the most lines of poetry, the most names of strangers, even the most random digits in five minutes. Watch Joshua Foer's TED Talk . The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race. Each year someone comes up with a new technique to remember more stuff more quickly, forcing the rest of the field to play catch up. Three-time World Memory Champion Ben Pridmore invented a memory system, which he alone has mastered, that allowed him to memorize the precise order of 28 shuffled packs of playing cards in one hour. He used a similar trick to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits in half an hour. Even more incredible than the mere fact of this feat is that this is not an innate talent, but rather a skill he taught himself. TED.com: How your brain tells you where you are . While there are lots of different tricks for remembering better, all of the techniques used in these memory contests ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding. And it's well illustrated by a strange kind of forgetfulness that psychologists have dubbed the ""Baker/baker paradox."" The paradox goes like this: . A researcher shows two people the same photograph of a face and tells one of them that the guy is a baker and the other that his last name is Baker. A couple of days later, the researcher shows the same two subjects the same photograph and asks for the accompanying word. The person who was told the man's profession is much more likely to remember it than the person who was given his surname. Why should that be? Same photograph. Same word. Different amount of remembering. TED.com: The real reason for brains . When you hear that the man in the photo is a baker, that fact gets embedded in a whole network of ideas about what it means to be a baker: He cooks bread, he wears a big white hat, he smells good when he comes home from work. The name Baker, on the other hand, is tethered only to a memory of the person's face. That link is tenuous, and should it dissolve, the name will float off irretrievably into the netherworld of lost memories. (When a word feels like it's stuck on the tip of the tongue, it's likely because we're accessing only part of the neural network that ""contains"" the idea, but not all of it.) But when it comes to the man's profession, there are multiple strings to reel the memory back in. Even if you don't at first remember that the man is a baker, perhaps you get some vague sense of breadiness about him, or see some association between his face and a big white hat, or maybe you conjure up a memory of your own neighborhood bakery. There are any number of knots in that tangle of associations that can be traced back to his profession. TED.com: A computer that works like the brain . As I describe in my book ""Moonwalking With Einstein"", the art of remembering better in memory competition -- and to remembering better in everyday life -- is about figuring out how to turn capital ""B"" Bakers into lowercase ""b"" bakers. It's about taking information that is lacking in context, lacking in meaning and figuring out a way to transform it so that it makes sense in the light of all the other things that you have floating around in your mind. Pridmore uses a complicated technique to memorize decks of playing cards and strings of binary digits, but we can all take advantage of the Baker/baker paradox. If you want to make something memorable, you first have to make it meaningful. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joshua Foer.","Josha Foer observed the 2005 USA Memory Championship and won it in 2006 .
He says you can teach yourself to remember a lot of information effectively .
One of the keys is to associate a word or a fact with other things you remember, Foer says .

"(CNN)  -- The U.S. Coast Guard has called off its search for as many as 79 Haitians missing after a boat capsized near the Turks and Caicos Islands, a spokeswoman said early Thursday. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted this crowded boat last week and repatriated its occupants to Haiti. The vessel overturned Monday with about 200 onboard, said Petty Officer Jennifer Johnson, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. Authorities rescued 113 passengers and found nine bodies, Johnson said. A nurse at a hospital in the Turks and Caicos said about 70 people were taken there, including four who had died. Five people were admitted to the hospital, and the others had minor injuries, the nurse said. The boat's occupants were migrants from Haiti, according to the Coast Guard. The overcrowded vessel was thought to have set sail from the Haitian port of Cap Haitien, the Turks and Caicos  Sun newspaper reported. The Coast Guard contributed one boat -- a 210-foot cutter Valiant -- and three aircraft to the search, Johnson said.  Watch Coast Guard rescue Haitians after boat capsizes » .

"(CNN) -- A man in Connecticut walks into an outpatient clinic for his daughter to receive an electrocardiogram and sonogram. He later receives a bill for a ""facility fee"" of $5,000 that his insurance will not cover. A new resident in California looks for a primary care doctor but must wait 3 weeks for an appointment to get refills on medication. A 25-week pregnant woman who works two part-time minimum wage jobs cannot afford the $50 co-pay for regular visits or the $200 in prenatal vitamins her doctor recommends. When her labor begins, she goes to the emergency room where her baby is delivered. Do any of these stories sound familiar? Probably. The United States health care system ranks dead last among 11 peer nations for overall quality and costs. According to Commonwealth Fund's latest findings, we have the least efficient, least fair and worst health outcomes among the nations surveyed. Americans have the highest death rate, the highest infant death rate and worst health at age 60. Yet Americans pay more than double what people in these other nations pay. It sounds bad, and it is. Let's try to look at it another way. Imagine you and someone from the town nearby are each going out for dinner. You have to go to restaurant A. There, you can only be seated if you have paid a membership fee. You receive a menu with no prices or descriptions of the meal and are served food you didn't expect and that is barely warm. But the decor is nice and the restaurant has fun commercials on television. Your neighbor has to go to restaurant B. There, the menu items are described clearly. He can see the prices, and the food that arrives at the table looks like what he ordered. The decor isn't much to write home about, and there aren't any commercials. When restaurant A is all you know, then, well, it is what's for dinner. But when you learn about restaurant B -- and how your neighbor pays less for more -- suddenly that cold meatloaf from restaurant A doesn't cut it. No one would tolerate such a terrible dining experience at restaurant A, especially not when a perfectly good meal is to be had across town at restaurant B. In the United States, our experience as health care consumers is a lot like dining at restaurant A -- a business that under normal market conditions would likely be closed within a week. The membership fee required for entry is your paid insurance premium. The menu with no prices is your treatment plan. Health care services are offered and rendered by providers without any real discussion of cost either to the health care facility or the customer. You agree -- because you need the medical care, and when the bill arrives later you learn it costs far more than you expected, even if you used insurance. Sadly, the U.S. health care system has been consistently low in ratings. Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in 2010, 2007, 2006 and 2004. And consumers know how bad things are. The 2013 Health and Workplace Benefits survey found that 55% of Americans rank U.S. health care as either ""poor"" or ""fair."" What should surprise all of us is our willingness to tolerate such a broken industry. We do not usually buy products or use services for the lowest quality for double the price. Unless, of course, there is a reason. Some would argue that health care is a service that is unlike any other in our economy. We purchase health care often unwillingly, or at times of great stress and medical concern. There is a huge gap in knowledge and power between doctors and nurses and patients. There is an almost total lack of transparency about cost, quality and outcomes among various insurance providers for different kinds of procedures or between health care facilities. And to add insult to injury, there is no restaurant B at which we can dine. Unless we move to Switzerland. Previously, the United States differs the most from peer countries for its absence of universal health insurance coverage. Now that the Affordable Care Act requires everyone in the United States to purchase health insurance, will our problems be solved? Hardly. The Affordable Care Act has made the United States a little more like Germany and Switzerland, but requiring citizens to purchase health insurance will not be the silver bullet for our health care woes. France and Canada have universal health insurance coverage and still rank 9th and 10th. What we must do is demystify the process of buying health care in the United States. Clear and accurate quality standards, price transparency, and more easily accessible outcome information are essential to allow consumers to make better choices. The Healthcare Blue Book and the Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Score are great examples, but we need more things like that. The United States can learn from what other countries have done right. Our government, hospitals, doctors, insurance companies and consumers can change our abysmal health care system if we put our mind to it. Because no one wants to eat an overpriced meal at a bad restaurant night after night, year after year.","Recent report shows U.S. health care system ranks last among peer nations .

"(CNN) -- ""I am a canvas of my experiences, my story is etched in lines and shading, and you can read it on my arms, my legs, my shoulders, and my stomach."" -- Kat Von D, tattoo artist . Tattoos have come a long way. Once lambasted as professional kryptonite and social sabotage, inked skin has now rooted itself in mainstream culture. In May, NBC News/Wall Street Journal released a poll that found 40% of Americans have someone in their household with a tattoo, up from 21% from 15 years ago. Last year, Forbes magazine said tattoos were becoming ""increasingly unproblematic across the board,"" even in the workplace. But the workplace doesn't seem to be ready for tattoos in certain areas -- mainly the face, head and neck. In 2011, 31% of employers nationwide told job website Career Builder that having a visible tattoo would hinder a candidate's likelihood of being promoted. Earlier this year, Army Regulation 670-1 enforced new rules prohibiting soldiers from displaying tattoos on the head, face, neck, wrists, hands and fingers. ""Tattoos are getting more and more accepted,"" said Alivia Foley, a 24-year old tattoo artist who has been inking clients full-time for six years in Seattle. ""But we're not there yet."" ""People will start treating you differently once you become a heavily tattooed person,"" said Foley, who has head and neck tattoos. Potential employers, law enforcement and even landlords can look askance at facial tats, in her experience. ""I just don't think they're for everybody,"" she said. The accepted few . Of course when Foley says highly visible tattoos are not for everybody, she means everybody who wants a professional job. For years American society has openly accepted celebrities who choose to sport highly visible tattoos. Boxer Mike Tyson, who had his face tattooed with a tribal symbol in 2003, was an early adopter of the look. Rapper Gucci Mane said he inked an ice cream cone on his cheek because he's ""cool as ice"" and top-selling rap artist Lil Wayne has teardrops and ""Fear God"" on his eyelids. Neck tattoos can be seen on anyone from urban youths to international arbiters of style. Rihanna and David and Victoria Beckham each have them. Even Oscar winner Jamie Foxx appears to have gotten a tribal symbol permanently drawn on the back of his head. ""Tattooing has gone from being counterculture to being something everyone is doing,"" Foley said. ""But societal repercussions are still there, especially with highly visible tattoos on the face, neck or hands."" This is certainly true with nonfamous men and women. Canadian rapper Drake was irate when a young fan followed the instructions from his song, ""Free Spirit,"" and got a tattoo of his name on her forehead. And take Jeremy Meeks, the ""Hot Felon"" who boasts a Facebook fan page with more than 228,000 likes, but has had his teardrop tattoo PhotoShopped out of some Internet memes. The teardrop, often associated with gang culture and violence, does not fit the high-fashion aesthetic of his dreamy blue eyes. Perhaps our culture is more willing to overlook a criminal history than a conspicuous blotch of ink. Anyone considering a facial tattoo should be warned about the repercussions, said Foley, the Seattle tattooist. ""If a tattoo artist is not giving a lecture on a face tattoo, they're not doing their job."" Foley will ink clients' faces only if they are already heavily tattooed -- and even then she will meet with them beforehand to ensure they have a clear understanding of the societal risks. But those who want them can still get face, head and neck tattoos without proper consultation and warning. In fact, some crude designs are done by nonprofessionals at home or in prison settings. ""Honestly, the tattoo community used to be very tight-knit,"" she said. ""But now you can buy kits off of Ebay and call yourself a tattoo artist without any apprenticeship or traditional training."" 'I feel more like myself' No amount of warning deterred Vin Los. Los, a 24-year-old aspiring fashion model, spent years getting rejected from agencies because of his diminutive height. Finally, he says, after a New York modeling agency told him he'd never get hired, he decided to make some changes to his appearance. Drastic changes. Los has more than 30 phrases tattooed on his body, including 12 across his face. They include words like fame, play, iconic face, sex, lick, Tokyo, and ""the most famous."" He estimated that his tattoo plans were initially rejected by eight artists. ""I know I'm intense and I live my life to the fullest,"" he said. ""But now I don't have to tell people 'this is who I am or these are my dreams.'"" ""Now they can read it and they can see it."" Sounds like Kat Von D. Los thrives on the media attention he receives but still has not completed his dream of signing to a modeling agency. He works as a bagger in a Montreal, Canada, grocery store. ""I don't get why people judge me,"" he said. ""People look at me, but no one will say anything. A lot of people think I'm crazy."" People's reactions, and Los' subsequent shock, come as no surprise to Michael Mantell, a San Diego psychologist. ""Tattoo lovers are bold, often rebellious and extremely identified with their body ink,"" he said. ""They have a strong sense of identity and they have no intention of hiding. They are not scared of public opinion and would love to let others know what they believe in."" However, Mantell, who wrote an article titled ""The Psychology of Tattoos"" for San Diego Magazine, said this boldness does not necessary translate into comfort with one's self, especially when it comes to highly visible tattoos. ""Tattoos on the upper body in a spot that's not typically covered says someone doesn't care what other people think -- but don't mistake that for a healthy sense of individuality,"" he said. ""It's more likely a sign of rebelliousness."" Mantell and Foley urged individuals to think before they ink highly visible tattoos on the face, head, neck and hands, again citing mainstream exclusion. But Los said he's never felt more like himself. ""For 10 months, I was wearing makeup to hide the tattoos and little by little I began to show more,"" he said. ""I am an artist and have always had the need to express myself, now I'm just doing that on my skin."" Los said he is very happy with his decision and loves the way he looks. He never felt a part of society, and now he has the face to match. Do facial tattoos change your opinion of a person?

"Bridgeport, California (CNN) -- The snipers, dug deep into their hidden positions in the snow, peer down at the valley below, searching for movement in the makeshift buildings set up. ""The open doorway ... a guy standing in the open distance five to 30 meters,"" one sniper comments as he stares through binoculars at the objective more than 1,000 feet below. There won't be a shot taken though. Perched approximately 10,000 feet up on a mountain top in the Sierra Nevada, the Marine Corps snipers are receiving elite training, learning how to shoot and kill in freezing, rugged terrain. The experience and skills will be helpful in the unforgiving mountains of Afghanistan. The men are already qualified snipers, but in this advanced training at the Marine Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, California, they learn to shoot at steep angles in an extreme environment. Senior snipers are always nearby to mentor. ""How are you guys doing?"" Gunnery Sgt. David Williams asks the group, crouching down at the top of their snow fort. ""Good,"" the snipers reply. ""How come no one's got a stove going?"" Williams asks. ""No one's got any empty canteens? There you go, you should be working,"" he pushes the men. Getting to the encampment is a slog through deep snow. It takes 4 1/2 hours of climbing to get to the seven snipers, trekking through snow as deep as 3 feet. The only sign of the snipers is bark-colored head caps. They moved in the night before, climbing six miles in the darkness, with only moonlight to guide their movement. It took the group less than three hours, much faster than a civilian pace, to complete the journey. Upon reaching the summit, the group set up a security perimeter and spent four hours digging out a snow fortification. One sniper, who only wanted to be identified as Chris, explained, ""Off to my right we have our observation post where we have eyes on with a sniper and spotter down on the objective at the bottom of the valley. We have a trench set up here on my left."" Chris, who says he is living out his childhood dream of being a sniper, says operations in the frigid mountains are especially tough. ""You move in under the cover of darkness ... the temperature last night dropped down a whole lot. Probably into the high teens,"" he said. ""You try to keep it small. You try to stay tactical. You've got the objective about 500 meters (a third of a mile) down the slope so you have to keep in mind the sound level you're making and staying low and out of sight."" Learning how to survive in the harsh mountainous terrain is an essential part of the training. ""It gives them initially the ability to move over this type of terrain. It's not as easy as one would think. It's not Sunday playing in the yard,"" Williams said. ""The mountains are a pretty formidable foe,"" he said. ""In addition to the enemy, the mountains themselves are a threat and it takes certain skills and training to move over them efficiently and be able to still perform those complicated tasks that the battalion commander assigns them with."" The snipers often supplement the gear they're issued with supplies from sporting good stores that they feel may work better in the environment. One essential gadget the group had in the dug-out trench was a ministove. ""You have to heat up the snow to make water. It lightens up your pack. You only have to carry about 2 quarts at one time 'cause you can just refill as you go,"" Chris said. Hydrating and warmth seem to be the basics for this group. Warming layers are vital. ""We bring what we want as far as comfort items go. So pack light, freeze at night,"" one sniper, who wished not to be identified, said. For these Marines, the training is very real. Many are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan in the coming weeks and months. ""The mountain sniper course focuses a lot on high angle shooting and that has a lot to do with the way the current war is shaping. We are moving out of urbanized areas and moving into more mountainous terrain,"" Chris said. Another sniper, who wished not to be identified, agreed with Chris on the importance of the skills learned. ""It's definitely an asset in the military, especially in an anti-terrorism role: You need more precision, you need to be like a scalpel in a way instead of just going around guns ablazing,"" he said. Precision is everything for this group, whose goal is one shot, one kill. Williams said these snipers must be able to shoot and kill from 1,000 yards away, or a distance of about 10 football fields. ""The Marine snipers' job is to basically engage targets at long range. Essentially they are the guardian angel for the battalion. They survey the battlefield, find potential threats and with approval eliminate the threats, as well as provide reconnaissance and surveillance on objectives to give accurate information back to the battalion and let them know what's out there,"" he said. About 25% of the Marines who take part in the mountain sniper training fail, but those enduring the course say they draw strength from their fellow snipers and the accomplishment that comes with completion. ""It's definitely miserable but you have to roll with the punches and you enjoy it once it's done. Once you get it under your belt there's a lot of satisfaction in it,"" Chris said.

"(CNN) -- Tesla Motors prides itself on promoting a disruptive technology -- electric cars -- but it was Tesla itself that was disrupted recently as New Jersey said it is illegal, effective April 1, to operate factory-direct car sales in the state. New Jersey is not alone. Arizona, Maryland, Texas and Virginia also ban direct sale of cars to consumers. Understandably, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was upset and has encouraged people in the Garden State to go to New York or Pennsylvania to buy Tesla cars. Many wonder whether Tesla has been out to turn the car-marketing world on its head, do away with the franchised dealership system and change forever the way people in the U.S. buy cars. It can seem that way as Tesla fights to keep selling its cars direct to its customers, but missed in the speculative fervor is that Musk himself has said that as it grows, Tesla probably would be looking at expanding its presence -- and sales -- through franchised dealerships. Today, progressive dealerships around the country representing every automaker are creating experiences that make car buying easier and deliver a high level of customer satisfaction. Musk could cherry-pick dealers who can deliver the experience he wants for his customers, just as Lexus did when it launched its brand in the U.S. in 1989. Selling and servicing cars is an entirely different business from making them. Using franchised dealerships relieves the car manufacturer of the tremendous capital burden of paying for and staffing brick-and-mortar facilities. That's one reason the auto industry went with that model in the first place. Besides, car dealerships are important corporate citizens, pumping into the national economy hundreds of millions of sales-tax dollars, tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions and billions of dollars in paychecks. That makes them valuable economically. It also gives them clout that few politicians want to challenge. More importantly for car buyers and car owners, a national network of franchised dealerships with local sales and service facilities can make buying and caring for a new or used vehicle relatively easy. You can see why the idea might ultimately appeal to Tesla. Tesla -- as innovative, different and disruptive as it may be -- is still a small player in a very large arena. It sold just under 25,000 cars last year globally. General Motors sold more than that every day. If Tesla has an eye on significant growth, the traditional dealership model, in its most progressive form, is a path the brand shouldn't ignore. Today, Tesla is arguing that it has no existing franchised dealers with which its factory sales compete, and that it is selling something so unique that an entirely different sales model is necessary at the beginning. That won't always be the case. So far, Tesla's game plan to make its money purely on car sales. (Electric cars bring in almost no service and maintenance income, which is lifeblood to most car dealers.) There also is no bargaining at Tesla, where the manufacturer's suggested retail price is the sales price, take it or leave it. That works when your customer base is largely a high-income group of ""early adopters,"" you have no real competition for your $70,000-$120,000 vehicles, you don't take trade-ins and the profit per vehicle allows you to pamper your customers with personalized services. That will change in a few years, though, when Tesla begins selling its planned third-generation electric car, one priced to compete with the likes of BMW's 3-Series. Reaching out to the mid-to-upper mass market where there is a lot of competition for the consumer's attention -- and dollars -- takes a different kind of approach. When Tesla scales to reach that more mainstream audience, turning to a more traditional sales format may indeed be necessary. Until then, the company has a high-profile battle on its hands. The courts, and the market, will decide the merits of Tesla's arguments. Even if Tesla were to prevail on the legal front in every case and win the right to continue selling direct to car shoppers in every state, that decision would hardly override the existing franchise protection laws and the value that locally owned and operated dealerships can bring to the equation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John O'Dell.","New Jersey's new law makes it illegal for Tesla to sell cars directly to consumers .

"(CNN) -- I'm one of those people who won't throw out electronics just because they're outdated. If a device is still working and potentially useful, I'd rather get it into the hands of someone who will continue to use it. And even when devices are broken or useless, I can't bring myself to landfill them -- I save them up for local electronics recycling drives. But even though I take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal doesn't mean I'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them. I bought a Droid Incredible last month. Since then, my two-year-old iPhone 3G has been gathering dust on my dresser. That iPhone served me well enough for a long time, and there's nothing really wrong with it. I'd love to pass it along to someone who wants it. ...Well, OK, there is one thing wrong with it: a few months ago I made the mistake of updating its operating system to iOS4, which drastically slowed its performance. (Cult of Mac, Wall Street Journal and many other venues are reporting the same problem.) This problem apparently is reversible, but not easily so -- and I just don't feel like trying. I've got many more pressing concerns. My phone's iOS4 performance problem is severe enough that I would be embarrassed to give this phone as a gift to anyone I know, or even to sell it directly to another party via Craigslist or eBay. So I found a middleman to shield me from embarassment, keep my old iPhone out of the landfill and let me make some easy money all at the same time. I'm selling my old iPhone -- as is -- to Gazelle.com, a ""reCommerce company"" that says it provides ""a practical, responsible, rewarding way for consumers to get value for used electronics."" In less than a minute Gazelle.com agreed to buy my old iPhone for $93. This week they're sending me a box to ship it to them, and after they've checked out the phone they'll PayPal me the money. (I'll report back if that part of the process doesn't work as promised.) Admittedly, $93 is less than half of what people here in the Bay Area are asking today for an 8GB iPhone 3G on Craigslist (although that may not be the price they're actually getting). And it's toward the low end of the price range for what folks are asking for this phone on eBay today. So yes -- if I want to sell my old iPhone, I definitely could make more money elsewhere. I don't care. My time is worth money. Avoiding hassle is worth money too. Frankly, if I had to deal with the hassles and risks of selling this phone myself via Craigslist or eBay, and also reverting it back to an older OS so it's bearably functional again to assuage my conscience, that iPhone would keep sitting on my dresser until the next electronics recycling drive. And then I'd have to pay someone to take it away. So for me, that $93 is a total gain. Gazelle.com spokesperson Kristina Kennedy explained that the company, which buys over 20 categories of electronics products in addition to cell phones, ends up ""finding new homes"" for more than 90 percent of the used devices they buy. Mostly they resell devices through sites like eBay or Overstock.com, or through wholesalers. ""Our brand appeals mainly to the upgrader market, the gadget geeks, the people who always want the latest devices,"" she said. ""There tends to be a large secondary market for their used devices, which normally aren't very old."" For instance, before the iPhone 4 was unveiled June 7, Gazelle.com was getting about 25 used iPhones per day. But as soon as iPhone users knew when they could get their new model, trade-ins on the site soared to 1500 units per day for two weeks. Since then it's tapered off (currently about 500 per day). Kennedy noted that there also is a thriving global market for refurbished older devices, such as a four-year-old BlackBerry. ""We tend to resell those for reuse overseas,"" she said. Gazelle.com has a no export / no landfill policy for recycling and disposing of products at the end of their useful life. This applies to their own operations and those of their downstream partners. Gazelle.com also follows the EPA's Responsible Recycling (R2) practices -- which is a good start, even though a recent Government Accountability Office report points out that the federal agency ""does not specifically regulate the export of many other electronic devices, such as cell phones, which typically are not within the regulatory definition of hazardous waste despite containing some toxic substances."" The Gazelle.com site did not ask me which operating system is on my iPhone 3G. Their short list of questions concerned the physical condition of the hardware, which accessories I have, etc. I asked Kennedy whether, given the widely reported troubles with iOS4 on the iPhone 3G, they'd start taking that into account into the price they offer on trade-ins. ""Right now we sometimes ask those kinds of questions, but only about computers,"" she said. ""As phones become more like computers, we might start to pay closer attention to that."" However you get rid of your old cell phones, be sure to protect yourself with proper precautions to delete your data. Also, remove your SIM card (if your phone has one).","Gazelle.com is a ""reCommerce company"" that buys used electronics on the spot .

"(CNN) -- She's not so much the pinup girl of British horse racing as the ""pinned-together girl."" Hayley Turner has been a trailblazer for female jockeys in the UK, but it's taken its toll on her tiny frame -- and she doesn't mind at all. ""I could break bones all day long,"" says the 31-year-old, who once received fan mail addressed to ""Hayley Turner -- Hospitalized somewhere in Cambridgeshire."" ""I do the same as the lads and get injured the same,"" she adds. ""It's not a man's world, not at all. Okay, more men do it but there are women too."" A year ago Turner lay crumpled on the turf at Doncaster racecourse. She had moved her mount Seal of Approval to the inside rail to vie for victory in the home straight, but the horse clipped the heels of a rival and crashed to the ground at full pelt on top of her. Her pelvis was broken, along with three vertebrae, just 10 days after she returned to racing following five weeks out with a broken ankle -- which to this day is still held together by screws. Turner's most serious accident was in 2009, when she was also trampled by her horse. She was found on the turf by medical staff with blood oozing from both her ears and her nose. ""I don't remember a thing, which is odd as I think I was conscious at the time,"" she says. ""With all the blood, it was obvious I'd bruised my brain quite badly. It wasn't stressful for me but it was for my family as it was a case of 'how bad is this' for them. Was I going to be brain-damaged for life?"" She made a full recovery but was then told by authorities she could not race for a full year, a decision she later appealed with the backing of her family -- and won 60 races that shortened season. ""My family hate the injuries as it's always a case of 'let's go to hospital and see how bad it is,' "" she admits, ""but when I'm not training I'm just annoying, ringing them the whole time, asking what they're doing. ""So I think they're happier when I get back riding."" In 2008, Turner was the first female jockey to ride 100 winners in a UK season, from nearly 1,000 races that year. She was the first past 500 career victories, the first outright Group 1 winner and, in reality, the first from Britain to have forged a full-time career in horse racing. Turner has more than 50,000 Twitter followers, making her more popular on the social website than high-profile Canadian jockeys Emma-Jayne Wilson and Chantal Sutherland, who have the edge in on-track wins. Her time at the top has coincided with an increasing number of women coming through the ranks in both her domain of flat racing as well as jump racing, but she is reluctant to reflect on the influence she has had on them. ""I feel happy for what I've done, personal pride, but anything more than that I don't think I'll appreciate until I stop riding,"" says Turner, whose first race was in 2000 -- almost three decades after women were first permitted to compete by the Jockey Club. ""I might look back and think, 'Actually, I did quite well with that.' But as I said, I work with the lads and like the lads. I don't feel any different and I don't get treated any differently by the other jockeys or trainers."" One difference is that at race meetings the two changing rooms are divided between the sexes, which can sometimes mean Turner has a room to herself. ""I love that as I can have a bit of a lie-down, so that's a perk,"" she admits. Despite her down-to-earth tomboy attitude, she did wryly admit to Tatler's website this year that she had once won a race on a horse called Wonderbra -- whose mother was named Supportive. But more of an honor has been riding winners owned by Britain's Queen Elizabeth -- the grand patron of the nation's racing and breeding scene. Unlike most of her peers, Turner did not come from a racing background. She hopes that will inspire aspiring riders to think, ""If Hayley's done it, why can't I?"" Her mother used to be a freelance horse-riding instructor and now runs a business finding new homes for retired racehorses, but the track was never a great interest in the Turner household. ""Actually it still isn't,"" says Hayley. ""My parents like the Shergar Cup (a prestigious event held at Ascot where she has competed in an all-female team) and, if I've got a ride in a big race, they'll watch it. But the main follower is my nanna. ""She'll look up my races the night before and know where I'm riding. If I win a race she always tells my mum so, after every win, I'll get a text from my nanna and my mum."" Her pathway into the sport was through a one-off taster session at a horse-racing school a friend was attending. She tagged along and that was it ... she was hooked. ""I left school and wasn't that interested in anything,"" Turner says. ""I did quite well at PE and textiles but this happened. It was then I became determined to be the best I could be, and I think that would have been the same whatever work I'd got into."" Not once have her family asked her to give up the sport she loves: ""I think they know it would make me even more determined."" And worrying about the risks is not an option -- if she did, Turner fears she would lose the courage to ride again. As proof of her determination, she has twice ridden Seal of Approval since last year's accident. She does, though, with her warped sense of humor, like to blame her previous brain injury on ""when I do stupid things, which is often"" -- but the reality is there are no scars from that 2009 incident. Fully fit from her latest stint sidelined in the latter part of last year, Turner is again competing in the British Champions Series, which began in May and culminates at Ascot on October 18 in the richest racing day on the UK calendar, with Â£3.75 million ($6 million) in prize money on offer across the five events. She won two BCS races in 2011, ranking seventh in its inaugural year, but is playing catch-up this season. She has 25 wins overall from 377 starts, compared to 60 from 449 in 2013. ""I'm just happy to be riding. It's not been my best season but I'm not too worried by that -- there's been some tough times to come back from,"" Turner says. ""You can be forgotten quickly as a jockey but I'm getting my foot back in the door. I'm getting plenty of rides and I'm happy with that.""","History-making female jockey Hayley Turner has made history in flat racing .

"(CNN) -- A CNN team has been denied credentials to cover upcoming local elections in Venezuela. A CNN en Español correspondent and producer appeared Friday at the Ministry of Communications in Caracas, and an official told them their credentials were denied. When the crew asked for an explanation, the official said that ""they didn't understand why CNN needed to send an anchor to cover local elections when there are two correspondents accredited in Venezuela."" The CNN team, including reporter Fernando del Rincón, intended to travel to the state of Táchira, where the most violent protests erupted in February in the southwestern city of San Cristóbal. Opposition Mayor Daniel Ceballos was accused of civil rebellion and conspiracy after the government said he failed to stop violent protests in his city. He was jailed in March and given a 12-month sentence. The city of San Cristóbal has never had a pro-government mayor. San Diego Mayor Enzo Scarano was also jailed for 10 months after the government accused him of ignoring an order given by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice to stop the protests. The wives of both the mayors are running in the municipal elections Sunday. Ceballos' wife has no political experience, while Scarano's spouse is a city councilwoman. CNN has been reporting on the protests since February when the attempted rape of a young student on a San Cristóbal university campus galvanized students, who took to the streets to speak out against crime, shortages, blackouts and a dire economic situation. Students were jailed and, in solidarity, protests began in other cities. In the course of CNN's coverage of the protests, del Rincón has been criticized by both President Nicolas Maduro and the president of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello. An investigative piece by CNN showed that Cabello lied about alleged weapons found at a retired general's home. The picture that he used as evidence of the weaponry was of a gun shop in Wisconsin. Human Rights Watch voiced concern in February that Venezuela was censoring the news media and highlighted Maduro's efforts to take CNN off the airwaves. Clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces have left more than 40 people dead and around 800 injured since February, according to officials. Maduro has said protesters are ""fascists and extreme right thugs"" who are trying to destabilize the government to promote a coup. Protesters call Maduro a dictator who has ruined the Venezuelan economy with failed socialist policies.","CNN's Fernando del Rincón and his producer are denied accreditation in Venezuela .

"(CNN) -- When traveling, some countries just don't like you. Or at least, it can certainly feel that way. A new report, put out earlier this month by the World Economic Forum, has ranked which countries roll out the welcome mat to travelers and which give the cold shoulder. The ""Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013"" ranked 140 countries according to attractiveness and competitiveness in the travel and tourism industries. Unwelcoming . Among the extensive analyses, one of the most interesting rankings was how welcome tourists are in each country, under the category ""Attitude of population toward foreign visitors."" And the world's most unfriendly country, according to the data? Bolivia took the dubious honor, scoring a 4.1 out of seven on a scale of ""very unwelcome"" (0) to ""very welcome"" (7). Venezuela and the Russian Federation were next. Interestingly, despite their huge tourist arrivals, South Korea and China tied with four other countries for the eighth least friendly spot. At the other end of the scale, Iceland and New Zealand were ranked the world's most welcoming nations for visitors. You can see a top 10 for friendliest and unfriendliest at the bottom of this article. Strengths and weaknesses . The ""friendly"" ranking was just one aspect of the report, analyzing each country's competitiveness in travel and tourism. That competitiveness is ""based on the extent to which they are putting in place the factors and policies to make it attractive to develop the travel and tourism sector."" In the overall Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index, Europe was the top region with the first five positions all held by European countries. Switzerland, Germany and Austria were the top three in that order. Switzerland has headed the ranking since the index began five years ago. Excellent tourism infrastructure and facilities, business travel appeal, sustainable development of natural resources and rich cultural resources were among the key factors in landing the highest positions in the rankings. Safety/security, underdeveloped infrastructure and concerns about sustainable development were among the factors bringing down countries' competitiveness. Haiti scored the lowest on the competitiveness index. The United States (6th) topped the combined Americas, Singapore (10th) just pushed out Australia and New Zealand to lead the Asia Pacific region, the United Arab Emirates (28th) was the highest performer in the Middle East and the Seychelles (38th) overtook Mauritius to head Africa. The report emphasized the need for continued development in the travel and tourism sector particularly for its role in job creation in a relatively stagnant global economy. The industry currently accounts for one in 11 jobs in the world. The report used data compiled from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey and hard data from private sources and national and international agencies and organizations such as the ICAO, IATA, UNWTO, World Bank/International Finance Corporation, IUCN, WHO and UNESCO.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner blasted President Barack Obama on Thursday for saying no U.S. combat troops would be placed on the ground in the fight against ISIS in Syria. ""An F-16 is not a strategy. Airstrikes alone will not accomplish what we're trying to accomplish,"" Boehner told reporters in his weekly media briefing. ""The President has made clear that he doesn't want U.S. boots on the ground. Well, somebody's boots have to be on the ground,"" he continued. ""And so I do believe that what the President has asked for, as the commander in chief, he has this authority to train the Syrian rebels, and frankly we ought to give the President what he's asking for."" Obama announced Wednesday night that his plan includes airstrikes in Syria, as well as training moderate Syrian rebels who are also trying to combat the militant group. The latter action requires specific congressional approval, and Boehner said he supports giving the President that authorization. Still, he blasted Obama's decision to draw a line on putting U.S. troops on the ground. ""I would never tell the enemy what I was willing to do or unwilling to do,"" Boehner said. Congress has not passed any authorization. And while Boehner said it would be in the nation's interest to vote, he punted to the White House, complaining it had not presented Congress with the language for a resolution. Pressed by CNN's Dana Bash on why Congress wouldn't just write its own language, Boehner reiterated that the White House has typically taken that initiative. ""That's not how this has happened,"" he said. ""The President would make that request and the President would supply the language for the resolution."" While he said he would support the authorization, he still remained skeptical of the President's mission. ""I'm not sure that we're doing all that we can do to defeat this terrorist threat,"" he said. ""If our goal is to eliminate ISIL, there's a lot of doubt whether the plan that was outlined by the President last night is enough to accomplish that mission."" Kerry: U.S. not at war with ISIS .

"(CNN) -- The campaign to become president of the United States is drawn-out and contentious, with key battles and strategies that can turn the outcome. In other words, sort of like playing a game. In both worlds there are good guys and bad guys, actions and reactions, and a prize at the end for the winners. Like a multiplayer game, a political campaign requires many people acting together to achieve an ultimate goal. Like a role-playing video game, it poses a series challenges that need to be completed before moving on to the next. A new computer game tests this theory by letting players become campaign managers for a presidential candidate in the 2012 race. ""The Political Machine 2012"" tries to gamify the electoral process by assigning scores to candidates' stances on such issues as gay rights, the national debt and the war in Afghanistan, then lets players sway voters through speeches, endorsements and advertising. The downloadable PC game lets players face off against a computer-controlled opponent or a human challenger over the Internet. Players can opt to manage Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in his quest to topple President Barack Obama, or run Obama's re-election campaign. For those who want a greater challenge, the game also lets players run the campaigns of other candidates, such as Ron Paul or Michele Bachmann, or even a fictitious candidate (you!). Chris Bray, the game's senior producer and lead designer, said developers tried to fill the game with timely hot-button issues and topics that would appeal equally to Democrats and Republicans. ""We wanted them a bit more tailored to what was actually in the current news cycle,"" Bray told CNN. ""That's why, even after the game shipped, we updated with new issues or tweaks. The issues that make for the best gameplay are where they are truly split issues, like the Chick-Fil-A controversy (over the fast-food chain's opposition to gay marriage)."" Developers didn't consult political advisers but relied on news reports and their own research into the strengths and weaknesses of the various candidates. They also researched previous elections to understand how voters reacted to issues and candidates. Over time, they were able to develop maps and grids, much like board games, to overlay candidates' political powers and their positions on issues. ""The main thing we wanted to know for the game purposes was the starting scenario of the game,"" Bray said. ""What is a solid Republican state? What is a solid Democratic state? And what's really up for grabs?"" The gameplay offers players many options on how to sway voters in key swing states, such as Ohio. Speeches by your candidate on local topics may win you hearts and minds in that state, but how will they play on the national stage? Do you sink your advertising dollars into a positive campaign or get dirty with your ads? Different strategies play out depending on your candidate's strengths and weaknesses, which states you think you can win and which you are willing to concede. For example, if you play as a Republican candidate, you can sink a bunch of resources (upgrade your campaign headquarters, pump money into the ads, etc.) into taking a huge, traditionally Democratic state such as Illinois. But then you've blown your entire campaign taking one state, sacrificing other states you might have won instead. The key, Bray said, is managing the game and realizing you don't need to win everything to be victorious, much like in real campaigns. ""As you play the game and learn the strategies, it's kind of clicking in your head that this is exactly how it works in real life,"" he said. ""No one really cares about this Republican state with two electoral votes. It's going to go Republican. It's not worth that much effort anyway, so you find yourself throughout the game making those calls."" Bray hopes players of the game will gain a better understanding of the nuances of the electoral process -- why voters are hearing certain messages from the candidates over and over, for example, and why candidates are only visiting certain states. ""The Political Machine 2012"" is designed to be balanced, making it equally challenging for candidates of both major parties. But fringe candidates will have an uphill battle. ""Someone like Michele Bachmann, if you have her as your candidate, it is going to be more difficult versus Obama or Clinton or whoever else,"" Bray said. ""If you play as (Ohio congressman Dennis) Kucinich, you've got a bit of a harder road. It is accurate to real life as to their chances to win."" Bray said it was striking to his team how the real-life political process lends itself to gaming and how the elements of campaigns (strategy, moving pieces, resource management) is in line with most games. Like real life, the game also forces candidates to sometimes decide between standing up for what they believe in and what might get them more votes. ""It's interesting to see as you are playing the game how quickly that just turns into 'What are the mechanics of what I need to do to win,'"" he said. ""In the game, you often find yourself very quickly going with what's politically popular, which I think speaks to the state of politicians' thinking in general.""","""The Political Machine 2012"" helps you ""game"" the electoral process .

"(CNN) -- When he watches personal trainers work with their clients at the gym he uses, Marqus Taylor often isn't impressed. ""From what I've seen, personal trainers tend to get in your face and make you feel less than you are,"" he says. Taylor, 30, is grateful he met his trainer at a local church in Chicago -- Brian Harris is full of kind words and encouragement, which has helped Taylor lose 160 pounds. Finding a personal trainer who makes you feel comfortable enough to expose your biggest flaws can be challenging. But they're called ""personal"" trainers for a reason -- they're there to guide you to your personal fitness goals, and to do so, they need to fit with your personality. The number of personal trainers in America will jump 24% by 2020, according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. As the field increases, clients will need to do more research to find the perfect fitness coach. It's important to consider everything from what your trainer wears to how they talk. Here are five qualities you should look for in a personal trainer: . 1. Patience . Patience is the key to a good client-trainer relationship, says celebrity trainer Ashley Borden. Trainers should understand that what works for one client may not work for another. He or she should do an assessment of your body when you first meet to familiarize themselves with your needs. Trainers should also find a comfortable pace for their clients, Borden says. Some clients may progress at a faster rate, while others may require more coaching and assistance. ""I love teaching and the journey of helping people find their bodies again,"" she says. 2. Communication . Your trainer likely will not be with you at all times during your workouts. That said, they should be able to explain things to you on the phone and teach you how to do certain moves without physically being present through every workout. ""(Harris) went above and beyond,"" says Taylor. ""When I first started the new plan, we spent half the day at the grocery store buying healthy foods because I'm not a smart shopper."" Taylor says since Harris told him what to eat and why, he has been able to shop and work out on his own. And communication goes two ways. ""If a client always cancels on me and pushes back workouts, it makes me feel like they aren't committed,"" Harris says. 3. Professionalism . While it's important to maintain a close relationship with a client, Borden says, there also needs to be a level of professionalism. ""I carry their water and get them a towel if they need one -- similar to service they would receive at a five-star hotel,"" she says. (That service comes at a price: Full-time trainers charge an average hourly rate of $28.27, according to the National Federation of Professional Trainers. The duration of your training session, the location and the experience level of your personal trainer will dictate the cost of your session.) Lastly, the clothes your trainer wears should be simple and plain. The attention should be on the client, Borden says -- not on what the trainer is wearing... or not wearing. 4. Education . Trainers should have -- and be able to show you -- an appropriate fitness certification for their area of expertise, Borden says. To become certified, personal trainers must pass an exam through accredited organizations such as The American Council on Exercise (ACE), the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) or the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA). Most exams cover exercise physiology, training and exercise procedures, nutrition, functional anatomy of the body and weight management. Each organization's certification exam will ask different questions. You can see an exam overview here. A high school diploma or GED is necessary to enroll in certification classes; however, not all employers require college degrees -- this will depend on whether your trainer practices privately or through an institution. Trainers should also stay up-to-date with the latest fitness trends and new research published in scientific journals. ""Basic fitness is always there, but this field is evolving,"" says Borden. ""I always check online to see if there are new studies or courses I need to look at."" 5. Personality . As a client, you want to feel comfortable and trust that your trainer has your best interest in mind. ""Brian is like my brother,"" Taylor says. ""We are really close in and outside of our training because he talks to me like a real person, not like a customer."" Once you have established what kind of personal trainer you want, you can start looking for them. The American Council on Exercise and IDEA, the world's largest association for fitness and wellness professionals, have online tools that can help you locate the personal trainers available in your area and filter your results to cater to your activity of interest, price range and gender.

"(EW.com) -- In just a few years, digital video has overtaken film-based shooting by an overwhelming margin. But in the interest of staving off premature extinction, a group of directors have banded together to keep the Eastman Kodak Co. making movie film. The Wall Street Journal reports that a group of directors, led by the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Judd Apatow, and J.J. Abrams (who is filming Star Wars VII on film) pushed studio heads into negotiations with the film company. These discussions, which the WSJ broke the lid on, revolve around promises to buy a set quantity of film for the next several years, regardless of whether they plan to use all of it. Kodak's motion-picture film sales have fallen 96 percent since 2006, from 12.4 billion linear feet to an estimated 449 million. Fujifilm Crop. left the business last year, and Kodak is the only major company left producing the product. The company's chief executive, Jeff Clarke, told the WSJ that Kodak initially hoped to enlist studios in a joint venture on its Rochester, N.Y., plant, but that proposal failed. The second solution, involving the purchase of mass quantities of film, became the consensus after filmmakers started to join the discussion (and personally lobby executives). Tarantino, for instance, appealed to Bob Weinstein, co-chairman of Weinstein Co. ""It's a financial commitment, no doubt about it,"" Weinstein told the WSJ, ""But I don't think we could look some of our filmmakers in the eyes if we didn't do it."" Weinstein's claims are supported by comments from other directors. Apatow told the newspaper that both film and digital video are ""valid choices"" but ""there's a magic to the grain and the color quality that you get with film."" In a separate interview, Abrams argued that ""film sets the standard and once it's no longer available, the ability to shoot the benchmark goes away. Suddenly you're left with what is, in many cases, perfectly good but not necessarily the best, the warmest, the most rich and detailed images."" In negotiations with Kodak, Weinstein Co. is joined by Warner Bros, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and Walt Disney Studios. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- My first investigation as a new Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Officer with the Centers for Disease Control was of a large outbreak of measles, mostly among Hispanic children, many under a year old, and many who became infected when they visited hospital emergency departments for other reasons. I will never forget how nervous I was. I wanted to do a good job for those children, their families and everyone around them. These infants were too young to be vaccinated, and as a result they were particularly susceptible. So we vaccinated those around them to stop transmission. By 2000, a decade after my EIS experience, measles transmission in the United States was declared to have been stopped. However, we still have occasional clusters of measles in pockets of unvaccinated children after measles has been brought into the United States from somewhere else in the world. Usually there are about 60 cases of measles in the United States in any given year. But this year we saw 175 reported cases in the first 11 months -- all ultimately linked to people who brought measles to the United States from abroad. Although most of us don't realize it because it is so rare in our country, measles is a serious disease. Worldwide, on an average day, 430 children -- 18 every hour -- die from measles and its complications. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 of 10 people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. Frieden: A nightmare health scenario we can stop . Today's interconnected world means we're all linked by the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Global travel speeds the rate at which infectious disease threats such as measles can be delivered to our doorstep. Some think infectious diseases are no longer a problem in the industrialized world. But the fact is that infectious diseases continue to be with us. That's why prevention is the key. The threat from measles would be far greater in the United States were it not for the development of the measles vaccine and its widespread use in childhood immunization programs around the world. This week we celebrate the 50th anniversary of its creation. Since 2001, a global partnership that includes CDC has vaccinated more than 1 billion children. Over the past decade, these vaccinations have prevented more than 10 million deaths. The worldwide effort to prevent deaths from measles will leave behind an important global health infrastructure that will continue to make the world more secure. Improvements overseas, such as strengthening surveillance and lab systems, training disease detectives, and building facilities to investigate disease outbreaks, make the world -- and the United States -- safer and healthier. Measles is just a plane ride away. It can be brought here by U.S. travelers and visitors from other countries. We must continue to be vigilant about measles transmission here at home. Parents should protect their children by making sure they've had two doses of measles vaccine. And all of us should make sure we're up-to-date on vaccinations, particularly prior to overseas travel. These steps will protect the United States from measles until the world becomes measles-free. CDC Director: A disease outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere . The opinions expressed are solely those of Dr. Tom Frieden.","Measles was declared eradicated in the United States in 2000 .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- An American doctor infected with Ebola is making progress a day after he arrived in Atlanta from Liberia, where he contracted the deadly virus. ""It's encouraging that he seems to be improving,"" Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ""That is really important, and we are hoping he will continue to improve."" The Christian charity that employs Dr. Kent Brantly confirmed that the 33-year-old received a dose of an experimental serum before leaving Liberia. ""We praise God for the news that Kent's condition is improving,"" Samaritan's Purse said in a statement. Brantly, the first known patient with the deadly virus to be treated on U.S. soil, landed at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Georgia on Saturday and was quickly rushed to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. He's one of two Americans sickened by the deadly viral hemorrhagic fever last month while on the front lines of a major outbreak in West Africa. Emory has said it will treat Brantly and fellow missionary Nancy Writebol in an isolation unit. Phoenix Air says its highly specialized air ambulance, equipped with an isolation unit, departed Georgia for Liberia on Sunday evening to pick up Writebol. The flight is scheduled to land in Georgia on Tuesday. Brantly's wife, parents and sister cried when they saw him on CNN walking from the ambulance into the hospital, another representative of Samaritan's Purse said on condition of anonymity. His wife, Amber, later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the United States and was ""confident that he is receiving the very best care."" ""I was able to see Kent today. He is in good spirits,"" she said Sunday. ""He thanked everyone for their prayers and asked for continued prayer for Nancy Writebol's safe return and full recovery."" Amber Brantly visited her husband along with their daughter in Liberia, but Frieden said ""they did not have contact with him when he was sick, so it does not appear that they would be at risk."" Tennessee doctor who worked with Ebola patients quarantines self . Brantly, who has ties to Texas and Indiana, and Writebol, of North Carolina, became sick while caring for Ebola patients in Liberia, one of three West African nations hit by an outbreak. Treatment in isolation . This will be the first human Ebola test for a U.S. medical facility. The patients will be treated at an isolated unit where precautions are in place to keep such deadly diseases from spreading, unit supervisor Dr. Bruce Ribner said. Everything that comes in and out of the unit will be controlled, Ribner said, and it will have windows and an intercom for staff to interact with patients without being in the room. Ebola doesn't spread through airborne or waterborne methods. It spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. There is no FDA-approved treatment for Ebola, and Emory will use what Ribner calls ""supportive care."" That means carefully tracking a patient's symptoms, vital signs and organ function and taking measures, such as blood transfusions and dialysis, to keep patients stable. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Ebola will go global . ""We just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection,"" Ribner said. Writebol was given an experimental serum this week, Samaritan's Purse said, though its purpose and effects weren't immediately publicized. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Emory's isolation unit was created with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is based nearby. It aims to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases and is one of four U.S. institutions capable of providing such treatment. The World Health Organization reports that the outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea is believed to have infected 1,323 people and killed more than 729 this year, as of July 27. Fight against Ebola . All the concerns in the United States pale in comparison to the harsh reality in the hardest-hit areas. Even in the best-case scenario, it could take three to six months to stem the epidemic in West Africa, Frieden said. There's no vaccine, though one is in the works. The National Institutes of Health plans to begin testing an experimental Ebola vaccine in people as early as September. Tests on primates have been successful. So far, the outbreak is confined to West Africa. Although infections are dropping in Guinea, they are on the rise in Liberia and Sierra Leone. On Saturday, Ebola claimed the life of a medical director at a hospital in Liberia's capital. A Saint Joseph's Hospital statement said Dr. Patrick Nshamdze tested positive July 29 after being sick for two weeks. In the 1990s, an Ebola strain tied to monkeys -- Ebola-Reston -- was found in the United States, but no humans got sick from it, according to the CDC. Sierra Leone deploys military; screens passengers . In Sierra Leone, where government officials have asked citizens to stay away from work, the military has deployed at least 750 infantry and military medical officials to 13 locations, military spokesman Col. Michael Samoura said Sunday. Health officials are screening incoming and outgoing passengers at the country's main international airport with a device that takes people's temperature from their eyes at a distance. Anyone showing signs of fever is taken away to have their blood tested for Ebola. Experts: U.S. health care system well-prepared for Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Last August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an ultimatum: Food manufacturers had one year to make sure any ""gluten-free"" products met FDA requirements. That deadline is up. To use the ""gluten-free"" label, products must now have an undetectable level of gluten and cannot have any ingredient containing wheat, rye, barley, or any their derivatives. If manufacturers continue to use the ""gluten-free"" label without bringing their food up to scratch, they will be subject to regulatory action from the FDA. (Some foods, such as pasta, may still be on shelves legally for a while if they were produced before the ruling.) A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for those who suffer from celiac disease, although gluten-free is increasingly become a popular diet choice for those who don't have the condition. There are approximately 3 million people in the United States who have celiac disease, and even a small amount of gluten can cause damage in their bodies. Some doctors also believe people can be sensitive to gluten or have a gluten intolerance, which is not as severe. Is gluten-free food a joke? Gluten is a protein complex found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. It is typically what gives foods made with these products their chewiness and elasticity. It is pervasive through so many food products, it can be a challenge to steer clear. The new labeling protocols should eliminate uncertainty for consumers, the FDA says. ""Without a standardized definition of 'gluten-free,' these consumers could never really be sure if their body would tolerate a food with that label,"" Andrea Levario, executive director of the American Celiac Disease Alliance, said in a statement. Federal regulations stipulate that the ""gluten-free"" label means that the product contains fewer than 20 parts per million of gluten. This measure is the lowest amount scientists can consistently detect in a food. A product labeled ""gluten-free"" also can't contain any of the following: . â€¢ An ingredient that is any type of wheat, rye, barley or a crossbreed of these grains. â€¢ An ingredient derived from these grains that has not been processed to remove gluten. â€¢ An ingredient derived from these grains that has been processed to remove gluten if it results in the food still containing 20 or more parts per million of gluten. The ruling applies to packaged foods only. FDA suggests that consumers remain inquisitive and ask questions about their food in restaurants and other establishments. ""FDA will work with partners in state and local governments with respect to gluten-free labeling in restaurants,"" the government agency said. Gluten: 5 things you need to know .

"(CNN) -- The prosecutor in the U.S. government's case against an Indian diplomat charged in New York with visa fraud related to her treatment of her housekeeper expressed dismay Wednesday over the direction the case has taken. ""There has been much misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the reporting on the charges against Devyani Khobragade,"" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara about India's 39-year-old deputy consul general for political, economic, commercial and women's affairs, who was arrested December 12 in New York by federal agents. ""It is important to correct these inaccuracies because they are misleading people and creating an inflammatory atmosphere on an unfounded basis."" He was referring to reporting about Khobragade's arrest outside her daughter's school, her detention in a cell with other women and her having been subjected to a strip search -- all of which raised diplomatic hackles in New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the diplomat's treatment ""deplorable;"" Indian National Security Adviser Shiv Shankar Menon called it ""barbaric,"" CNN sister network IBN reported. Indian officials summoned U.S. Ambassador Nancy Powell, took away U.S. diplomats' identification cards that gave them diplomatic benefits and removed security barriers outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. But Bharara said Khobragade's treatment was justified. He cited an 11-page complaint that alleged she had promised in the visa application under which her housekeeper moved from India to the United States to pay her at least $9.75 per hour, the minimum wage in New York, and to require that she work no more than 40 hours per week. But the complaint alleges that Khobragade then had the housekeeper, who has been identified as Sangeeta Richard, sign a second contract, which paid her less than $3.31 per hour and required that she work much longer hours. The second contract, which was not to be revealed to the U.S. government, ""deleted the required language protecting the victim from other forms of exploitation and abuse"" and also deleted language that said Khobragade agreed to abide by U.S. laws, he said. Khobragade is charged with one count of visa fraud -- which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison -- and one count of making false statements -- which carries a maximum sentence of five years. Khobragade's lawyer, Daniel Arshack, said the allegations were unsubstantiated. ""When the facts are looked at, it's perfectly clear that Dr. Khobragade did nothing wrong,"" he told CNN's ""Piers Morgan."" ""She paid her worker exactly what she was supposed to pay her and the government has simply made a whole series of spectacular blunders, which has enroiled (sic) them into quite a remarkable diplomatic kerfuffle."" He added that the housekeeper was paid ""well above the minimum wage,"" and that his client had -- at the housekeeper's request -- sent a portion of that money to the housekeeper's husband each month in India. ""The balance of her pay was paid to her in the United States -- all of it,"" he said. Arshack accused the U.S. government of having treated his client ""like an ordinary U.S. citizen charged with a crime. The fact is she isn't an ordinary U.S. citizen. She's a diplomat with immunity."" Citizens of India express their outrage . Concern over the treatment by U.S. authorities of Khobragade, not her alleged treatment of her housekeeper, has sparked outrage. On Tuesday, outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, demonstrators seething over what they considered to be humiliating treatment of the Indian diplomat, carried signs protesting the U.S. handling of the matter. ""If USA will not respect Indians, then Americans will not be respected in India also,"" read one. In his statement, Bharara noted that Khobragade was charged not only with trying to evade U.S. law intended to protect domestic employees of diplomats and consular workers from exploitation, but also with causing the victim and her spouse ""to attest to false documents and be a part of her scheme to lie to U.S. government officials."" He bemoaned that public outrage was focusing not on Khobragade's alleged treatment of the housekeeper and her spouse, but on the U.S. government's treatment of the diplomat. ""Is it for U.S. prosecutors to look the other way, ignore the law and the civil rights of victims (again, here an Indian national), or is it the responsibility of the diplomats and consular officers and their government to make sure the law is observed?"" he asked rhetorically. Bharara defended the handling of the arrest and custody, though his office was not involved. ""Khobragade was accorded courtesies well beyond what other defendants, most of whom are American citizens, are accorded,"" he said. ""She was not, as has been incorrectly reported, arrested in front of her children. The agents arrested her in the most discreet way possible, and unlike most defendants, she was not then handcuffed or restrained."" In addition, she was allowed to keep her phone and make calls to arrange personal matters, including child care, he said. ""Because it was cold outside, the agents let her make those calls from their car and even brought her coffee and offered to get her food. It is true that she was fully searched by a female deputy marshal -- in a private setting -- when she was brought into the U.S. Marshals' custody, but this is standard practice for every defendant, rich or poor, American or not, in order to make sure that no prisoner keeps anything on his person that could harm anyone, including himself. This is in the interests of everyone's safety."" Bharara acknowledged that the alleged victim's family has been brought to the United States, but said that that happened after a legal process was initiated in India in an attempt to silence her and compel her to return to India. An injunction was issued in September by the Delhi High Court seeking to stop Richard from ""instituting any actions or proceedings against Dr. Khobragade outside India on the terms or conditions of her employment,"" the Indian Embassy said last week in a statement. It said the U.S. government had been asked to find her ""and facilitate the service of an arrest warrant, issued by the Metropolitan Magistrate of the South District Court in New Delhi."" Bharara said it had been necessary to bring Richard's family to the United States. ""This office and the Justice Department are compelled to make sure that victims, witnesses and their families are safe and secure while cases are pending,"" he said. Complaints reach the highest levels . Still, the complaints from the Indian government, a close U.S. ally, have reached the highest authorities. President Barack Obama has been briefed on the issue, White House spokesman Jay Carney said. And the top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State John Kerry, called Indian National Security Adviser Menon on Wednesday and tried to smooth over the ruffled feathers. ""As a father of two daughters about the same age as Devyani Khobragade, the secretary empathizes with the sensitivities we are hearing from India about the events that unfolded after Ms. Khobragade's arrest, and in his conversation with National Security Adviser Menon he expressed his regret, as well as his concern that we not allow this unfortunate public issue to hurt our close and vital relationship with India,"" the State Department said. Asked whether Kerry's regret was about what happened in New York or the response to it in India, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, ""Regret on the situation at large, I would say both, honestly. He certainly expressed regret about what happened with this case at large, sort of how this has all played out."" Harf said appropriate procedures appeared to have been followed in the arrest by U.S. marshals, but that conditions surrounding Khobragade's processing would be examined ""to ensure that all appropriate procedures were followed and every opportunity for courtesy was extended."" Still, the charges stand. Harf also said that Khobragade enjoys ""consular immunity,"" a limited diplomatic immunity related to her official duties. Under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, consular officials can be arrested for acts committed outside official job functions. The State Department said Khobragade's consular immunity does not cover the charges she faces. Indian officials, too, appeared to be intent on keeping the diplomatic eruption from escalating. ""Let me assure you that there is no change in the security situation as regards to any diplomats in India, including U.S. diplomats,"" said Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's External Affairs Ministry. He said U.S. officials shouldn't read too much into the removal of cement barriers in front of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. ""India is fully committed to ensuring the safety and security of all diplomats in Delhi and elsewhere. So, please do not have any doubts on that score; we will provide full safety and security within the confines of India law."" Dana Sussman, a lawyer for the housekeeper, said Richard had tried to improve her situation by dealing directly with Khobragade, but the attempts were unsuccessful. The issue goes beyond a labor dispute for Richard and others in similar positions. ""Our clients who work as domestic workers are living in the home with their employers,"" she said. ""So, if they leave, they not only leave their legal status, they leave their only source of income, they leave the only home that they've known in a foreign country."" She said Richard has no passport, is living with friends and has been granted temporary legal status that allows her to remain and work in the United States until the matter is resolved. Richard herself has brought no claim against Khobragade and has no plans to do so, she said. A source who has spoken with Richard said she is in her early 40s and had worked previously with other diplomatic families in India. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Deborah Feyerick, Elise Labott, Harmeet Shah Singh and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Kerry calls India's national security adviser, expresses ""regret""

"(CNN) -- The FBI is turning to the public for any information about the apparent kidnapping in Mexico of a U.S. Marine reservist. Armando Torres, III was kidnapped, along with his father and uncle, by armed men in La Barranca, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on May 14, the FBI said. Torres drove across the International Port of Entry Bridge at Progresso, Texas, to visit his father's ranch in La Barranca, Tamaulipas, the FBI said. Shortly after he arrived at the ranch, armed gunmen entered the ranch and took Torres, as well as his father, Armando Torres II, and his uncle, Salvador Torres, by force, the FBI said. The father and uncle are Mexican citizens and the three have not been seen or heard from since. The state prosecutor's office in Mexico's Tamaulipas state told CNN that neighbors said the apparent kidnapping could be tied to a land dispute involving the Marine's father. Torres, of Baytown, Texas, is a corporal in the Marine Individual Ready Reserve. The State Department is aware of reports that a U.S. citizen had been kidnapped in Mexico, an agency official not authorized to speak for full attribution told CNN. ""The U.S. Consulate General in Matamoros is working with Mexican authorities to obtain more information. Due to privacy considerations, we cannot provide further information,"" the official said. Mexican authorities have launched an investigation and the FBI has opened an international kidnapping investigation.

"(CNN) -- Angela Baldwin can pinpoint the day she changed the course of her life. Her friend invited her to a dance fitness class in March 2013. Baldwin tried to think of an excuse to skip it, but couldn't come up with one so she reluctantly tagged along. At this point, the Prestonsburg, Kentucky, social worker weighed 350 pounds. She hid in the back of the room so few people would see her. Then something unexpected happened: Baldwin really enjoyed the class. ""The music moved my soul,"" she said. ""Even though I felt sure I was going die after each song, I kept moving."" Growing up, the 5-foot-10-inch Baldwin had always loved music and dance, but had never tried classes or training. She was used to being ""the biggest person in the room,"" and had been all her life. ""I had become so miserable I did not want to leave my house,"" she said. At her heaviest, she said she wanted to just ""curl up and die."" Baldwin began attending the classes twice a week, and the pounds started to drop off. Baldwin was especially encouraged after learning that her instructor had lost 100 pounds through dance fitness. ""When I saw (the weight loss) happening I gained a new drive and determination that I had never had before. I suddenly knew I could be healthy and have fun in the process."" Buoyed by her progress, Baldwin, now 43, started supplementing her diet with protein powder. As summer came around, she was attending classes five nights a week, and began ""eating clean,"" avoiding processed foods. As her weight continued to drop, Baldwin's confidence grew. By October 2013, she was down to 250 pounds. In addition to her classes, she began three days of high intensity interval training and three days of weight training. Baldwin's instructor, Tabitha George, began to notice more than a physical change. ""She went from hiding in the back of class -- very shy, very withdrawn -- to moving to the front of class with a very outgoing and can-do attitude."" Her mother has noticed the difference too. ""The results are remarkable,"" said Ann Stumbo. ""She is a different person today in body, spirit and attitude from what she was when she began with one visit to a (dance fitness) class."" Baldwin is now down 127 pounds from when she started. She no longer needs to take medication for her blood pressure, depression or anxiety. She still hopes to lose 50 additional pounds, which would bring her to her goal weight of 175. To that end, she's started running 5K races, and has completed six so far. ""I am so much stronger than I ever thought possible, mentally and physically,"" she said, crediting it all to dance. She believes the classes saved her life. ""If I had not found the dance fitness class that I attend and the supportive group of women there, I believe I would have been either dead by now or so large that I could not leave my home.""","Angela Baldwin credits dance classes for helping her lose 127 pounds .

"(CNN) -- They came up just short in their knockout-round match with Belgium on Tuesday. But online, Team USA is already a World Cup winner. FIFA, international soccer's ruling body, says fans in the United States have been more active on its websites and mobile apps than any other country. During the past 28 days, 36.7 million U.S. fans have engaged with the World Cup's online properties, a spokesman for the organization said. That's 11.2% of the country's population and has accounted for 23% of the total activity. FIFA measured actions on its website and Facebook page as well as downloads of its mobile app. The news was a surprise to folks at the Zurich, Switzerland-based FIFA. Unlike most nations in the world, soccer has been slow to capture the imagination of sports fans in the States, where ""football"" is played mainly on Saturdays and Sundays and you can use your hands a lot more. But as the U.S. men's team played its way out of a tough opening-round group that included Germany, Portugal and Ghana, U.S. Web users spent a total of 847 years and 143 days engaged with FIFA content. That's more than soccer-crazy rivals Brazil, Germany, England and France combined. Part of all that may be American fans working hard to catch up. In four years, U.S. visitors to FIFA properties have grown 207%, according to the organization. A look at the 10 most active states reveals some no-brainers and some surprises. California and New York rank No. 1 and 2, respectively, in terms of visits to the World Cup website and time spent there. But Texas, where American football, from ""Friday Night Lights"" to the Dallas Cowboys, borders on a religious sacrament, has been No. 3. It's worth noting that U.S. team captain Clint Dempsey hails from Nacogdoches, Texas. Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington, Georgia, Massachusetts and Virginia round out the Top 10. This year's World Cup is already poised to shatter records as the biggest social-media and Internet event ever. In its first week alone, the tournament spurred 459 million posts, likes and comments on Facebook, according to the company. That's more than the Super Bowl, Sochi Winter Olympics and Academy Awards combined.

"(CNN) -- We've come a long way since my early days as the associate medical director of the AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hospital in the 1980s and 1990s. By 1990, I had seen over 500 patients die from a disease that we just couldn't treat. As an infectious disease doctor, I was overcome not only by the tragic loss of life, but also by the inability to find the ""magic bullet"" to help prevent these deaths. Like many of my colleagues, I devoted my time to caring for my patients and to research. I am proud to say that many of the successful antiretroviral treatments (ART) that were developed emerged from San Francisco General. HIV/AIDS treatment was then, and remains today, a true game-changer in saving lives. In the early 1990s, we made unprecedented progress in addressing AIDS in the United States by putting people on treatment. Yet, when I traveled to Africa in the mid-1990s, I was devastated to see what was happening there. AIDS was literally destroying an entire generation, and eroding the very foundation of many African nations. At that time, 85% of the burden of disease was in sub-Saharan Africa and less than 5% of the treatment capability was there. That was when I realized that devoting my energies solely to international work was the natural evolution of my career. I was determined that this history of lives needlessly lost would not be repeated. We could not -- and our country has not -- turn our backs on the suffering that was right in front of us. Today, as President Obama makes this historic trip to Africa, we are at a point where an AIDS-free generation is within sight. With the world's largest number of people living with HIV and AIDS (5.6 million), South Africa has always been on the front lines of the epidemic. The U.S. government's response to the epidemic in South Africa began in 2003 when non-governmental organizations initiated the provision of ART.  In October 2009, the tide truly began to turn when South African President Jacob Zuma declared: ""We need to move with urgency and purpose to confront this enormous challenge ... Most importantly, all South Africans need to know their HIV status, and be informed of the treatment options available to them."" The South African government, with support from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria, has saved hundreds of thousands of South African lives. To date, we have joined forces to provide 7 million South Africans with HIV testing and counseling, conducted over 170,000 voluntary medical male circumcisions for HIV prevention, and supported more than 1.6 million on ART. And South Africa has reduced the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV at six weeks of life dramatically -- from 8.7% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2011. PEPFAR has invested $3.7 billion in supporting South Africa's HIV/AIDS efforts. As South Africa's battle against AIDS has evolved, so has PEPFAR's support. Last year, we signed an agreement to make our partnership based on co-investment, showcasing South Africa's leadership in caring for and treating its own people. As U.S. funding shifts increasingly to HIV prevention, health systems strengthening and technical support -- South Africa is expanding its own investments in the care and treatment of HIV and TB. With the South African government in the lead -- coordinating planning and alignment of implementation with PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and other development partners -- will we see reduced costs and increased access to health and social services. These new partnerships with high-burden countries, forged by the Obama administration, have been a driving force in our collective push to achieve an AIDS-free generation. They allow PEPFAR to invest its resources where they are most needed -- in those countries whose governments do not yet have the capacity to provide critical services for their citizens. Last week, I attended a 10th anniversary celebration of PEPFAR with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, at which he announced that the one-millionth baby will be born HIV-free this month, thanks to PEPFAR. One million babies in 10 years. Today, I am proud to stand with President Barack Obama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu at one of the pioneering youth and HIV centers in Cape Town. Thanks to the dedication of President George W. Bush, President Obama and bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress -- what a difference a decade has made. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- To convincingly yell ""I am Hercules!"" in his new action movie, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson had to do more than warm up his vocal chords. As a former pro wrestler, The Rock was already approaching Greek demigod territory in terms of build, but even he had to change his diet and exercise to become mythologically ripped. According to USA Today, the 42-year-old actor had to endure a ""Hercules diet"" that consisted of seven meals a day, extremely heavy on protein. The Rock would start with a hearty breakfast of four egg whites, five ounces of oatmeal and a 10-ounce filet of steak. By meal No. 3, he'd have wolfed down another eight ounces of chicken breast; eight ounces of halibut; two cups of white rice and two cups of a green vegetable, like broccoli or asparagus. Meals four through six were essentially more of the same, with a few baked potatoes thrown in instead of rice. It sounds like a lot -- and that would be because it is -- but The Rock told USA Today the diet was pretty painless. ""The only tough one was the last meal of the day, No. 7,"" he said, referring to the nightcap of 10 egg whites scrambled with vegetables, plus 30 grams casein protein. ""I get back to the hotel room, I'm ready to go to sleep. But I have to down 10 egg whites."" But it sounds like eating those eggs was like downing cake compared to the workout portion of his Hercules training plan. ""It was grueling,"" The Rock told CNN of his training plan at the ""Hercules"" premiere in Los Angeles on Wednesday. ""It was for six months, and then it was for an additional six months once I got (on set),"" the actor said. ""So it was the most challenging role that I had ever taken on -- physically and mentally, but I'm happy to be here and I'm happy to know the movie's good."" The Rock's not just hyping his project. According to RottenTomatoes.com, ""Hercules"" was 70% fresh as of July 24. Directed by Brett Ratner, the movie follows Hercules into war as he tries to protect the King of Thrace. Also starring John Hurt and Ian McShane, ""Hercules"" opens Friday. Comic-Con: Ben Affleck's 'Batman' makes an appearance . More 'Iron Man'? Sounds good to me, Robert Downey Jr. says .

"London (CNN) -- A little over 30 years ago, Dalston was just another gritty, working class neighborhood to the northeast of central London. Today, boutique cafes dot the high street, hipsters with delicately manicured beards saunter about on fixie bikes while flash newbuild apartments rise high above the local train station. ""It's just such a cool place with lots of creative people,"" said 23-year-old Amy, a fashion student originally from France who lives nearby. A short bus journey south reveals a similar story in Shoreditch, the nerve-center of east London's flourishing tech hub and home to the newly developed ""Silicon Roundabout."" Like in Dalston, local council initiatives and business incentives have enticed nascent start-ups and ambitious young professionals in the creative and tech industries to the area. A glimpse through a ground level office window reveals a group of twenty-somethings lounging around on bean bags as they daintily tap away at Macbooks and tablets. Across the room, another casually dressed bunch huddles around a table tennis table with bats in hand ready to brainstorm. ""(Since the 1980s) a community has developed here across all of the arts,"" explained local councilor Guy Nicholson. ""That community gradually over the years gathered more of a presence."" The London borough of Hackney (where Dalston and Shoreditch are situated) has attracted the highest proportion of people working in culture, media and sporting industries across the city in recent times, according to analysis of census data by real estate agency, Savills. But beyond the young urbanites that have come to populate these areas, one doesn't have to look too hard to find traces of the old Dalston and Shoreditch. Bargain stores, pawnbrokers and bookmakers remain a prominent feature while a social housing trust receives visitors on the ground floor of an imposing tower block a few hundred yards from Dalston Junction train station. By comparison, a nearby street once nicknamed ""murder mile,"" due to its high number of drug and gun related crimes, is now filled with cocktail bars, designer denim stores and organic green grocers. ""We've got lots of new bars ... but those who were born and bred here simply can't afford to live here anymore,"" wrote local political candidate and resident Pauline Pearce in the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper recently. ""It has caused real problems for the youngsters. A lot of them don't know where they should go now, or where their real communities are."" The creative class . For Dalston and Shoreditch in London, read Williamsburg in New York, Kreuzberg in Berlin, Mission District in San Francisco, Preston in Melbourne and many other formerly working class neighborhoods in cities around the world (with broad regional differences). According to Loretta Lees, professor of human geography at the University of Leicester, what has happened follows a well worn pattern of urban development. Creative, young, artistic types are enticed to move into an area by low rents or through encouragement from local councils. As time passes, more people move in attracted by what they see as the aspirational, cool vibe, hoping to become a part of this fabric themselves. This influx brings in higher earning individuals and increases the local tax base which can lead to improved public services. But it also pushes up the cost of rent, goods and services in the area and eventually house prices too. While this may be no bad thing for the new arrivals who can largely afford it, many of those who have lived in the area for generations can be priced out. These issues were passionately highlighted by film director Spike Lee earlier this year in an appearance at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. ""People want live in Fort Greene. People wanna live in Clinton Hill. The Lower East Side, they move to Williamsburg, they can't even afford ... Williamsburg now because of ... hipsters,"" Lee said of the once downtrodden areas that are among the Big Apple's most discussed neighborhoods today. Some of the new arrivals, who Lee accused of having a colonizing ""Christopher Columbus syndrome"" even move on before the gentrification process is complete, when rents rise or when places become too mainstream for them. Vice Magazine melodramatically asserted that Dalston was dead in 2013 before highlighting the next low-income areas of the British capital in line for an influx of so called cool kids. According to professor Lees, these developments are simply a subtle form of gentrification, hidden behind friendly terms like ""unleashing the creative economy,"" ""regeneration"" and ""urban renewal."" The major difference is that those doing the gentrifying are fond of elaborate facial hair, artisanal food and retro kitsch rather than the formalwear of a shirt and tie. ""Local borough councils have been heavily supportive of policies and processes of gentrification but they'll call them regeneration, particularly arts led, around places like Hackney and Dalston,"" Lees said. A side effect of this has been that ""lots of low income social groups in London now have been moved out beyond the suburbs to low income areas there."" Building from within . Yet while far from enthusiastic about these developments, Lees is quick to point out that there are multiple layers of complexity that must be recognized when trying to fully grasp this issue. City neighborhoods are constantly changing and evolving after all, inviting in a range of demographics and income groups as others move out for pastures new. Areas that were once prosperous and safe can quickly fall on hard times or vice-versa. Should districts that have become rundown not also seek to revitalize and improve the lot of the people who live within them? According to Guy Nicholson, the answer to this question is an emphatic ""yes"". He describes Dalston's proud history in the entertainment and design industries before falling on tougher times. This is something the local council wants to revive, he said. Inevitably this will bring many new and creative people to the area. ""One of the focuses of local government in all of this is to try and work to ensure that the wider community in Hackney can also remain engaged and part of this change that is going on around them so the many can benefit,"" Nicholson said. ""There's a great spirit of collaboration in play in trying to mold and shape this opportunity in a way that has a wider social benefit."" Hackney Council encourages firms to work in conjunction with local schools to offer work experience, internships and apprenticeships at businesses operating in the community. Many courses at the district's colleges are also tailored to the creative industries operating in the area. These efforts are mirrored in cities experiencing similarly rapid changes around the world. Professor of architecture, planning and preservation at Columbia University, Lance Freeman, points to groups such as Brooklyn's Fifth Avenue Committee who have worked to ensure there is affordable housing for long-term residents of their neighborhoods and that not everyone is priced out. Yet even with these well-intentioned attempts at inclusion, tensions between the old and new remain. Artist, filmmaker and Princeton professor, Su Friedrich documented the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg -- once home to vibrant Hispanic, Polish, Jewish and Italian communities -- as it was rezoned by city authorities and housing developers (then hipsters) moved in for her 2012 film, Gut Renovation. ""Its such a ridiculous, horrible neighborhood now,"" Friedrich told CNN. ""The demographic is basically like being on a college campus. Everybody is in their mid-20s, has money and walks around with an iPhone in their hand."" Friedrich adds that while the majority of these people define themselves as creatives, they actually work in graphic design, advertising or write for magazines -- a far cry from what she defines as truly artistic or creative. She also speaks of hearing similar tales in cities like Vienna, Berlin and Toronto while on the promotional tour of her film. Others however are more anodyne about these developments. Some even speak of the benefits an influx of new people has brought to their area. ""I think its a good thing to have lots of different people and new people move here,"" said Dalston grocery store owner, Erol Gandagli. ""(Why would you want to live) in an area where everyone is the same?""","Urban neighborhoods in cities like London and New York are changing rapidly .
Young and creative communities have popped up in once working class areas such as Dalston and Williamsburg .
Some say the speed of change is upending neighborhoods and pricing out long time residents .
Others say it is regenerating long neglected areas for the better ."
"(CNN) -- Shana Verstegen started logrolling when she was 7. Her parents signed her up for a class at the local YMCA in Madison, Wisconsin, and she loved everything about it: the battle of strength, balance and agility between two opponents trying to stay on a log in the middle of a lake. ""It sounds absolutely silly, but it's a serious sport,"" Verstegen says. Serious enough to make her a six-time world lumberjack champion -- and give her a serious six-pack. Verstegen became a professional ""lumberjill"" when she was 17, and has spent the last decade and a half traveling the world, competing in lumberjack competitions. Next up is the Lumberjack World Championships in Hayward, Wisconsin, this week. She'll be competing in the logrolling and boom run events. In logrolling, two lumberjacks fight to roll their opponent off a log that is 12 to 14 inches in diameter (depending on the competition). Evenly matched pairs can stay on for more than seven minutes, Verstegen says. ""You need every single muscle in your body ... if you get tired your technique goes out the door,"" she says. ""One little misstep and its over."" In the boom run, competitors race across logs chained together on the water. You're allowed two falls in the timed event. It's one of the more dangerous lumberjack sports. Logrolling, Verstegen says, is one of the safest. There are programs dedicated to the sport across Wisconsin, and in other states such as Minnesota, Michigan and Oregon. Verstegen coaches hundreds of children each year. ""(The kids) don't realize they're exercising, they're having so much fun,"" she says. ""And they're doing something totally unique."" It's a way for Verstegen to give back. Her mother was diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, a degenerative brain disorder, when Verstegen was 5 years old. Her parents wanted to keep life as normal as possible, so they told her to pick a few sports from a YMCA catalog. Logrolling became Verstegen's escape from being a caregiver. ""I was allowed two to three hours every day after school to just do sports and to be myself and to not think about my mom's sickness,"" she says. ""It was never ever about winning. It was that time to go there, to be with my friends, to be stupid, to get yelled at by my coach. ... That kept me going through all those tough years."" During competition season, Verstegen is on the water nearly every day. She also does resistance training several times a week and hill sprints to increase her endurance and speed. She sticks to lean meats, produce and good carbohydrates to stay energized. Verstegen knows not every child will fall in love with lumberjack sports like she did. The key to fighting childhood obesity, she says, is to find something that inspires them, whether it's logrolling, rock climbing or ballet. ""When they see fitness they immediately think (of) lifting weights, running marathons -- doing things they don't enjoy. But the options are endless.""","Shana Verstegen is a lumberjack champion and ACE-certified personal trainer .

"(CNN) -- Few countries in Asia have suffered as much turmoil and internecine warfare in recent decades as Cambodia. The ""secret bombing"" campaign in the early 1970s, orchestrated by the soon-to-be-impeached President Richard Nixon and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, the most contentious of Nobel Peace Prize winners, pushed many moderates towards the Khmer Rouge, who stormed into Phnom Penh in April 1975 to declare victory and begin a reign of tyranny that some historians have called the most radical experiment in communism ever conducted. With an agenda of half-baked Maoism and class warfare that included emptying cities, banning money, and executing intellectuals -- or anyone wearing glasses -- the Khmer Rouge tried to create an agrarian utopia. Instead, they wound up masterminding a genocide that left an estimated 1.7 million Khmers dead. That legacy is on grim display in Phnom Penh's most popular dark tourism sites of the secret prison at Tuol Sleng and the Killing Fields. Textbook tortures . Known by the code name S-21, the former high school of Tuol Sleng became the Khmer Rouge's secret prison and the most potent symbol of its brutality. Over the course of four years as many as 20,000 prisoners passed through here, including four Frenchmen, one Brit and two Americans. INTERACTIVE: Five faces of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge . Only seven survived. Upon arriving at the prison, each inmate was photographed. These black and white portraits hang in the second of four buildings. They are the most haunting part of this memorial site. Some inmates are wide-eyed with fright. Others appear resigned to their fate. Some are mere children. Others are women with babies. All of them put a human face on what was an inhuman regime hell-bent on extinguishing every last spark of individuality and family loyalty from its citizenry, for the Khmer Rouge referred to itself only as ""Angkar"" (the Organization). Its leader was a paranoid megalomaniac whom, as Philip Short recounted in his comprehensive biography, ""Pol Pot: The History of a Nightmare,"" believed in preserving secrecy at all costs, to the point where his handwriting has never yet been identified. An ongoing struggle for justice after Khmer Rouge . Building A has been preserved exactly as the Vietnamese invaders, weary of Khmer Rouge attacks, found it in early 1979, right down to the bloodstains on the floor and the implements of torture left on the bed frames scabbed with rust. In another building, paintings by Vann Nath, one of the seven survivors, illustrate in living colors how the prison's torturers went about their deathly business, extracting the most trumped up confessions through the most barbaric of means. Far from being a museum piece, the tragedy of Tuol Sleng continues to play out in the last act of a UN-backed genocide trial. The prison's former chief, Comrade Duch, the alias of Kain Guek Eav, has already been sentenced to life in prison for war crimes, while two other members of the Khmer Rouge top brass, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan wait in the wings for their trials to begin. Burial grounds . The first time I visited the Killing Fields outside Phnom Penh in 2003, I was transfixed by a tree with a sign that read in Khmer and English: ""Chankiri tree against which executioners beat children."" That was done to save bullets. My driver pointed at nails sticking out of the tree -- they had been used to drive home the regime's barbarity and speed up the executions. Just then, a little girl appeared beside the tree, her face peeking over an urn stacked with bones that went up to her neck. She looked like a ghost, but in fact was one of the child beggars in the area. The tree still stands, but the urchins have been evicted. When local authorities renovated the Killing Fields in 2011, this series of mass graves, where the Khmer Rouge executed and buried the prisoners trucked in from Tuol Sleng, they turned it into a site that documents, with painstaking accuracy, the ultra-Maoists' atrocities. Complete with a pagoda of skulls for an epicenter-piece, these burial grounds have a concussive impact on visitors. Thanks to the refurbishments, you can listen to the strident battle hymns of the Khmer Rouge once blasted from speakers to drown out the cries of the condemned men and women being beaten to death with the axles of oxcarts, or having their throats slit with the serrated edges of a palm frond. To really come to grips with Cambodia's dark past and understand why 70% of its populace are under 30, these two memorial sites stand as tombstones to those times of turmoil and the Khmers' courageous resilience in the face of peril.

"(CNN) -- Eating well while traveling doesn't always mean hitting up the newest, hottest and trendiest locales. Besides, given the notoriously high failure rate in the restaurant industry, chances are the memorable new restaurant you try this year won't be around in the years to come. Those who want a side of history with their dinners -- and a higher probability for a return visit -- should seek out some of America's wonderful, still-thriving historic restaurants, from the centuries-old steakhouses in Manhattan to San Francisco's 100-year-old seafood counter, Seattle's midcentury four-star, and the Tex-Mex breakfast spot that Austin, Texas, politicos, from Lyndon B. Johnson onward, have called home for decades. A second helping of historic U.S. restaurants . Old Ebbitt Grill, Washington, D.C. Washington icon the Old Ebbitt Grill has been attracting the likes of presidents and beltway movers and shakers since its opening in 1856. It is the city's oldest bar and restaurant, and though it has relocated twice -- most recently to 15th Street two blocks from the White House in 1983 -- many of the original spot's artifacts, including taxidermy and gas lamps, made the move. Like many of the country's oldest restaurants, Old Ebbitt serves a take on saloon fare -- meatloaf, chops, burgers -- but the chefs here also rotate in specials based on local ingredients and seasonality. The very famous Oyster Bar should not be missed. 675 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C., 20005 . 10 best new bars in the United States . Keens Steakhouse, New York . New York teems with venerable, historic restaurants and boasts a fair share of the country's most distinguished steakhouses, yet Keens Steakhouse stands above the rest. Albert Keen founded the restaurant in 1885 in what was then the Theater District, Herald Square. Now, it's a living relic, with a handful of clubby, wood-paneled rooms decked out in historic paraphernalia, framed old paintings, photographs and menus. The ceilings heave with 90,000 clay pipes once smoked by regulars, including Babe Ruth, JP Morgan and Teddy Roosevelt. What to order? That's easy: the famed mutton chop, on the menu from the beginning and perfected year after year. 72 West 36th Street New York, NY 10018 . Are you a travel over-sharer? Canlis, Seattle . Canlis is a baby on this list, clocking in at just 62 years old, but it's a treat for any traveler who appreciates lineage, architecture and high-caliber food. First, the building is a midcentury masterpiece --- all windows and stone and soaring ceilings -- designed by the father of Northwestern architecture Roland Terry and Honolulu-based Pete Wimberly. Inside, diners find an elegant four-star restaurant, run by third-generation owners Mark and Brian Canlis. They revamped the menu offerings in 2008 when they brought chef Jason Franey on board, snatching him up from the Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park in New York. Now the restaurant is at the forefront of the Seattle dining scene, relevant and revered. 2576 Aurora Avenue North Seattle, WA 98109 . Pacific Dining Car, Los Angeles . In 1921, when Los Angeles was transfixed by train travel and urban trollies, Fred and Grace Cook built and opened a trolly car specifically designed as a restaurant. It was a quick hit, and they were able to pick up and move easily when their rent grew too expensive. Now, Pacific Dining Car has been parked solidly in the same spot for almost 90 years (and expanded into a new location in Santa Monica). Since they age prime beef on the premises, the restaurant is known for its excellent steaks. Because it's one of the few fine dining options open 24-hours a day, it enjoys a solid patronage from late-night eaters. 1310 West 6th Street Los Angeles, CA 90017 . Swan Oyster Depot, San Francisco . Come lunchtime San Francisco food lovers looking for pristine seafood, a clubby atmosphere, white tablecloths and power players head to 163-year-old classic Tadich Grill. Those looking for the same pristine seafood but less pomp and more fun head to Swan Oyster Depot, one of the real restaurant gems of the Bay Area. The space consists of just one long raw bar, with around 20 stools, manned by a handful of friendly shuckers and servers doling out oysters, clams, lobster, chowders, seafood salads and wine. It's all about the charm, not about the pretense. Getting there outside of prime time lunch hours will guarantee a shorter wait to get in, as the secret has been out on this place since it opened in 1912. 1517 Polk Street San Francisco, CA 94109 . Jacob Wirth, Boston . Boston, of course, is rife with historic tourist attractions, including restaurants. And though German pub Jacob Wirth is the second oldest restaurant in the city, having opened in 1868, it is more of a local hangout and Theater District go-to than a tourist hub. They serve solid pub grub -- burgers, mozzarella sticks, fish 'n' chips -- as well as authentic Germanic fare like Wiener schnitzel and sauerbraten and have one of the biggest beer selections in the city (with taps that are changed regularly, given the crowds). There are sing-a-longs every Friday night to complete the beer hall vibe. 31 Stuart Street Boston, MA 02116 . Cisco's Restaurant Bakery, Austin . Widely known for serving the best breakfast in Austin, 62 year-old Tex-Mex spot Cisco's is family run and has been a local favorite for generations. The migas are legendary, but don't miss their huevos rancheros and complimentary hot fluffy biscuits. It is an established hangout for Austin politicos and looks about the same as it did when Lyndon Johnson held court here many mornings during his days in the Legislature. 1511 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78702-3375 . Commander's Palace, New Orleans . Of New Orleans' historic grande dame restaurants, and there are a few, Commander's Palace, built in 1880 in a stunning Victorian house, is the one that isn't just banking on its storied reputation. The kitchen has produced New Orleans legends, from Paul Prudhomme to Emeril Lagasse, and today showcases the food from future culinary rock star Tory McPhail. The space suffered severe damage during Hurricane Katrina but was successfully refurbished and reopened in October 2006. The guidebooks will report that brunch is popular, and it is, but that's not the time to go. Head over there for an elegant dinner of haute Creole dishes like Louisiana crawfish gnocchi, pecan-crusted Gulf fish and tenderloin of fire-spiced pork. 1403 Washington Avenue New Orleans, LA 70130 . Calumet Fisheries or Berghoff, Chicago . Calumet Fisheries is not really a restaurant. It's a take-out fish shack and smokehouse on the edge of the Calumet River in Chicago, offering all manner of gorgeous smoked and fried fish to seafood-loving locals who wait patiently for their lunches and then chow down in their cars. It's a classic institution, attracting crowds since 1948, and a must for visiting seafood fanatics. 3259 East 95th Street, Chicago, IL 60617 . Those seeking a historic Chicago dining experience with actual chairs and tables better head toward the Berghoff, the 114 year-old German icon and one of the oldest family-run businesses in the country. What started as a men's-only beer hall to showcase the Berghoff family's signature beer has evolved over the century into a modern German restaurant with pierogis, Jager schnitzel, beer-battered cod and some un-German selections like mushroom paninis and Cajun chicken salads. 17 West Adams Street Chicago, IL 60603 . Ralph's, Philadelphia . Ralph's, the oldest Italian restaurant in the country continuously owned by the same family and a one-time favorite of Frank Sinatra, serves the classic rib-sticking red sauce Italian-American fare that is now so ubiquitous it's almost passe in the food world -- lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, eggplant parmesan. But as one of the true Italian-American originals, Ralph's serves this food well and serves it with pride in a boisterous row house. The three floors of the restaurant quickly fill on most nights with regulars, locals and visitors wanting to get an authentic introduction to the Italian culture of South Philly, so reservations are recommended. 760 South 9th Street Philadelphia, PA 19147 .

"New York (CNN) -- If she had been at the scene of the crime, forensic evidence would prove her guilt, but Amanda Knox says there is nothing -- no DNA, no hair, no footprints, no handprints -- to show she was there. Knox spoke in an exclusive interview with CNN on Thursday, two days after an Italian court released an explanation of her conviction. In a retrial, Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, her then-boyfriend, were found guilty in the 2007 death of Meredith Kercher, Knox's onetime roommate. ""I did not kill my friend. I did not wield a knife. I had no reason to,"" Knox said. ""In the month that we that we were living together, we were becoming friends. A week before the murder occurred, we went out to a classical music concert together ... We had never fought."" Knox struggled to speak at moments in the interview, seemingly overcome by emotion and thoughts of Kercher. But, for the most part, she was calm, collected and methodical in how she broke down arguments in the case. In its more than 300-page document, the Florence appeals court said a third person convicted in the murder, Rudy Guede, did not act alone, and cited the nature of the victim's wounds. Ruling Judge Alessandro Nencini, who presided over the second appeal in the case, said Kercher and Knox disagreed over the payment of the rent in the house they shared in Perugia and that ""there was an argument then an elevation and progression of aggression."" Knox dismissed those allegations out of hand. ""If I were there, I would have traces of Meredith's broken body on me. And I would have left traces of myself around -- around Meredith's corpse,"" she said. ""And I -- I am not there. And that proves my innocence."" 'I'm not that person' When asked what type of person Judge Nencini must think she is, Knox cited his report. ""He believes the prosecutor when the prosecutor describes me as a person who was capable of not only completely disturbing everyone around me, but then getting drugged up,"" she said, trailing off. ""But I'm not that person. And the evidence doesn't show that."" She said she has been haunted by how people perceived her behavior in the immediate aftermath of the murder. Knox was filmed kissing Sollecito outside the murder scene. At the police station, she reportedly sat on Sollecito's lap, making faces. She told Kercher's friends she must have suffered. ""I think it's true that people seemed to have had a kind of tunnel vision in my regard and that has been something that I've been having to fight against for a long time,"" Knox said. The Florence court in January said that Knox, who also was convicted of slander, was sentenced in absentia to 28 1/2 years in prison. Sollecito's sentence was 25 years. They were first convicted of murder in 2009, but those verdicts were overturned on appeal in 2011. Claudio Hellman, the judge who tossed their convictions, has lashed out at colleagues. ""The Florence Appeal Court has written a script for a movie or a thriller book while it should have only considered facts and evidence. There is no evidence to condemn Knox and Sollecito,"" said the judge in a scathing statement obtained by CNN. ""It's a verdict that, seems to me, is the result of fantasy and has nothing to do with evidence."" Guede is the only person in jail for the slaying, and many aspects of the crime remain unexplained. 'It's not a complex case' Knox's conviction has raised questions about her possible extradition to Italy to serve her sentence, since she was in the United States and did not attend the retrial. She gets one more appeal -- to Italy's highest court. She said she thought the Florence appeals court would find her innocent, and was caught by surprise when it didn't. ""As this case has progressed, the evidence that the prosecution has claimed exists against me has been proven less and less and less. And all that has happened is that they've filled these holes with speculation,"" she said. Separately, Knox added: ""What I keep seeing in this case is trying to put an artificial complexity to it. It's not a complex case."" If Italy's highest court affirms her conviction, the country could ask for her to be sent back to Italy, where she spent four years in prison awaiting and during her first trial. U.S. authorities would then have to decide whether to extradite. Knox said she is hopeful such a scenario can be avoided and that her next appeal will be successful. She is optimistic her life in limbo will finally be resolved. ""From this whole experience, especially in prison where you have to take everything day by day, right now I'm having to take everything step by step. And if I think about everything that I could possibly be facing, it's way too overwhelming for me to even conceive,"" Knox said. ""I truly believe that it is possible to win this, and to bring an end to all of the speculation and the nonsensical theories, and really bring peace to everyone who has suffered."" Chris Cuomo reported this story in New York. Dana Ford reported and wrote this story in Atlanta.","""I truly believe that it is possible to win this,"" Amanda Knox tells CNN .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- The soldier that Israel claimed Hamas militants captured Friday, as a temporary cease-fire to the conflict in Gaza rapidly unraveled, is dead, Israel's military said. ""Lieutenant Hadar Goldin ... was killed in battle in the Gaza Strip on Friday, August 1,"" the Israel Defense Forces announced early Sunday. It's not clear whether Goldin, 23, was captured as the IDF had previously said, or whether he died alongside two other soldiers in an armed clash in Gaza. Military spokesman Peter Lerner said Goldin was promoted to lieutenant posthumously. Speculation about his fate was already up in the air after the armed wing of Hamas, the al Qassam Brigades, announced it had lost contact with a group of its fighters in the Rafah area -- the same area where Goldin was reportedly taken. In a statement posted on its website, the militant group says it assumes all the fighters died in an Israeli airstrike, including possibly an Israeli soldier. The group -- which denied having info on Goldin -- stopped short of saying the soldier was captured, using the phrasing ""assuming he was captured by the fighters."" Whatever happened, the entire ordeal has only served to heighten the hostilities -- with Israel claiming it must attack Gaza in order to prevent the onslaught of rocket attacks on its territory, while Hamas and other Palestinians assert Israel is the aggressor and directly responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths. And the bloodshed shows no signs of letting up. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Saturday to ""continue to act in full scale"" against Hamas until all militant tunnels are destroyed. He told reporters in Tel Aviv that Israeli troops have ""managed to hurt severely"" the capability of Hamas during the Gaza operation. But they're not done. ""In the beginning of the operation we promised to bring back calm and order (to Israel), and we will continue to operate until this goal is reached no matter how much time or force it takes,"" Netanyahu said. The prime minister said that after the tunnels are destroyed, Israeli forces will ""regroup,"" depending on their security needs. Izzat Risheq a senior Hamas leader and a member of its political bureau, told CNN that Netanyahu's statement was ""an admission of failure, defeat and confusion."" ""The Palestinian resistance will continue to stand up to this Zionist aggression and defend our people until this aggression stops and the siege ends and the just goals of our people are achieved,"" he said. Barbs and accusations fly . Each side continued to blame the other for the collapse of an attempted cease-fire Friday, which disintegrated before it ever really took hold. Israel has blamed Hamas for going after its soldiers, including Goldin, soon after the cease-fire was to begin. Since then, the IDF has resumed shelling -- including hitting 200 ""terror targets"" in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including ""tunnels, weapon manufacturing and storage facilities, and command and control centers."" A huge predawn blast rocked Gaza as the Islamic University was apparently hit by Israeli shelling. According to the IDF, it was targeting ""a Hamas military wing facility"" involved in weapons development within the building. In addition, Israeli aircraft targeted a missile launcher used to fire at Tel Aviv early Saturday, the IDF said. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal told CNN's Nic Robertson that Israel thwarted the temporary peace by staying in Gaza and destroying tunnels there. ""A truce is a truce, but the presence of the Israeli forces inside Gaza and destroying the tunnels means it's an aggression,"" he said in an exclusive interview from Doha, Qatar. ""The Palestinian resistance has the right to self-defense and the right to deal with the invading Israeli forces who are inside our Gaza territories."" Talking about the Israelis, Meshaal said, ""What were they doing during the truce? They were destroying tens of houses, justifying their actions that they were looking for tunnels. What kind of cease-fire is this, it has no meaning this way."" The Palestinian death toll Saturday stood at at least 1,712, with more than 9,000 wounded, said Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra, spokesman for the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, via Twitter. The dead included 398 children, 207 women and 74 elderly people. In a statement, Palestinian officials warned of a public health disaster because of the lack of water, sanitation and primary health care. The health ministry said 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the Israeli operation, displacing 450,000 people. Shelters were overcrowded and unsanitary. Cases of viral meningitis have jumped from five to 53 per day, the ministry says. And shelling and aerial attacks prevented authorities from retrieving decomposing bodies, which pose a significant health threat. Ata Abu Rezq, a father of eight in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, described the bombing there as relentless. He reported fire and smoke about 10 miles away in Rafah. His family has had no electricity for at least 36 hours and is relying on a generator for power, he said. ""When it runs out ... we will have to see what happens,"" he said. ""We use gas to cook. When we run out of gas, we will really be in trouble."" What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? What is Israel's endgame in Gaza? Peace efforts out of Cairo . As the conflict continued, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi touted an Egyptian cease-fire initiative as a ""real chance"" to stop the bloodshed and the best way to get help into Gaza and launch talks. An Egyptian proposal put forward last month was accepted by Israel but rejected by Hamas. An official Palestinian delegation arrived in Cairo on Saturday to attend the negotiations, the official news agency MENA reported. The delegation included a representative of Fatah and Palestinian intelligence, with Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives set to arrive later, the report said. ""We're hoping that they will be able to negotiate not just an end to this latest tragic bloodshed and to save lives and end this carnage, but also to try to dismantle all the causes that have brought about such a horrific situation,"" Hanan Ashrawi, executive committee member of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the West Bank, told CNN's ""New Day. But, according to Israeli media reports, Israel will not send a delegation to Cairo. The divisions between the two were on display as far away as Washington, D.C., where thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied outside of the White House, calling for an end to U.S. aid to Israel. ""Palestinians are humans, too. We bleed all the same,"" said Nader Kalifa, an American of Palestinian descent. ""The innocent civilians, all they want is peace. They just want some hope. We need to give them something."" Tensions flared when a small group of pro-Israel protesters gathered on the margins of the pro-Palestinian rally. Both groups shouted slogans and, in a handful of cases, some strong words, at each other. Inside a Hamas tunnel . Opinion: Gaza peace struggle drains me of hope .

"Ashkelon, Israel (CNN) -- On Monday morning, the sirens went off in Ashkelon, warning of an incoming rocket from Gaza. I was asleep and in that foggy state of mind made the mental calculation not to get out of bed and seek shelter, despite the blaring red alert. This happens so often on Israel's side of the Gaza border that sirens are just another part of your day and it's easy to become complacent. Seconds later, a distant boom. I've only been here for little more than a week, but I'm already falling into this strange routine. The beach in front of my hotel here is gorgeous: Blue water, kids playing in the surf while their parents soak up the sun. In the quiet moments, it's hard to believe there's a war going on less than a 20-minute drive away. But then another siren will go off. Some people quickly walk to shelters. Others ignore it. Most rockets fall into open areas or get intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system. The rockets from Gaza are wildly inaccurate, but the rare direct hit can be deadly. When I talk to residents, they often try to describe this distant but constant threat, more psychological than physical. Being driven to madness by rocket fire is a common problem here. Inside a Hamas tunnel . Support for the Israeli operation . Few believe any form of negotiation will work, and nobody is shy about telling you what they think. Many not only believe the Gaza offensive is justified but want the Israel Defense Forces to escalate the operation, to demolish Hamas and its rockets once and for all. Two recent polls in Israel showed more than 80% of respondents rejected a cease-fire as long as rocket attacks continued and the tunnel network in Gaza remained, even while supporting the continuation of Operation Protective Edge until Hamas is overthrown. On the roads, blue and white banners flap their support for IDF soldiers. Tour buses of civilians come to hand out ice cream and care packages to resting soldiers, stuffed with socks and underwear, favorite snacks and sweets. Chabad caravans are parked alongside the highway to offer spiritual support. One man at a gas station offered me this unsolicited metaphor on dealing with Gaza and Hamas: . ""When your child is young, you can beat him when he does something wrong. But when he is older, then it's too late. Beating him will do nothing. You must do more."" I was left wondering what ""more"" could be and whether violence could end the threat forever. Every day, the casualty count in Gaza rises. It's now more than 1,000 dead and thousands more wounded. The vast majority are Palestinian civilians caught in the relentless shelling of their neighborhoods. People here are aware of the pain and suffering the Israeli military has inflicted. Most I spoke to don't take any joy in it. There is, instead, a grim determination to get the job done, however brutal. One kibbutz member told us he had been hoping to host a family exchange, allowing members of a Palestinian family in Gaza to live in an Israeli home for a while, to start a dialogue. But then the war happened. A group of Hamas militants managed to burrow under the border and infiltrate only a few hundred meters from his home. An IDF patrol engaged the militants, killing most of them, but he and his wife spent that night in their safe room, listening to the deafening sounds of battle outside. He still wants dialogue but, unsurprisingly, only after the IDF has dismantled the tunnel network that came so close to his home. Big reminders of war . During the day, we drive down the 232 border highway and see a country mobilized for war. Merkava tanks kick up dust rumbling alongside the road. Armored personnel carriers are transported by trucks. Giant armored bulldozers wait for orders. Usually, we get off the highway and drive through the sunflower and melon fields to catch sight of a military unit or artillery position. Last week, we happened upon a unit nestled in a green orange grove, just a few hundred meters from the Gaza border. They had just pulled out of Gaza. Our cameraman shot video of the tanks returning from the border and the troops relaxing in the setting sun. It was strangely peaceful. Overhead, planes and helicopters dropped flares and we counted the booming pattern of artillery fire and wondered where the shells were falling on the other side. The soldiers next to us did not look victorious in any way. They just looked exhausted and dusty. More than 40 Israeli soldiers have been killed so far. This is the biggest loss the Israeli military has suffered since its 2006 war in Lebanon. But it has not diminished the appetite for war and may even strengthen Israel's resolve. I was struck by how one military family, whose eldest son was killed in an ambush in Gaza, spoke through their grief to describe the righteousness of their cause, a conviction that blends fervent nationalism and religious devotion. ""The Jewish people are the most moral people. Those people on the other side are the ones without morals,"" the father told me. And when I asked about the possibility of peace, he just laughed: ""Who are you going to make peace with? Hamas? We gave Gaza back to them 10 years ago. And who is sitting there now? Not the good people. Not good Palestinians."" 'We came here to see it with our own eyes' In the evenings, we set up our live shot location near the Gaza border to see the skies light up with flares and feel the ground shake with the sound of outgoing artillery. We aren't the only ones. Plenty of residents from nearby towns come to watch: Teenage girls in summer dresses. Men with barbeques and shisha pipes. Professional journalists and amateur photographers with cameras and microphones in hand. Sometimes the crowd is rowdy, angry. One night, a group of men cheered the bombing on, whooping whenever a shell landed. They were not fans of CNN. And when they found out who we were, they threatened our engineer and grabbed our camera. But that's not always the case. One night, a group of Bedouin Arabs watched the surreal light show next to a group of former and serving soldiers. The mood was somber, subdued. The soldiers did not want to talk. They watched the scene with grim intent. ""We came here to see it with our own eyes,"" explains one of the Bedouin men, ""They are our brothers, Arabs like us. It hurts us to know that they suffer like this, especially during Ramadan."" Monday is actually the end of Ramadan, leading to Eid al-Fitr. And when I got up Monday morning, after the siren sounded, there was a faint hope of de-escalation on this holiday. Overnight, the rocket attacks had subsided somewhat and there was only the occasional IDF strike. By late afternoon, the lull in fighting had disappeared: A rocket barrage from Gaza, then Israeli airstrikes. And even as I type this, another siren blares and I can see the children on the beach flatten themselves in the sand or sprint for shelter. The boom sounds in the distance. And, then, life here resumes as normal as can be under the circumstances. But somewhere in Gaza, the military's response is swift and devastating and I cannot help but wonder how many more will die today. War knows no holiday.","In Ashkelon, rocket attack sirens go off so often, the sound is just another part of the day .

"(CNN) -- In nearly two thirds of Middle Eastern countries, there are more women than men in university, according to United Nations statistics. This is a giant step towards -- and in many cases beyond -- one of the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals: to eliminate gender disparity in all levels of education by 2015. While most women's rights campaigners welcome the progress in education, many are concerned it does not translate into greater equality in the workplace. ""The gender gap has been closed in education in many Arab countries, which is a big achievement of recent years,"" said Dima Dabbous-Sensenig, Director of the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World at the Lebanese American University. ""It's very recent,"" she added. ""Even in the 1990s there was a big gender gap in education. However, there's a paradox that we have a lot of women getting a higher education and they are still too absent from the workforce and politics. ""The idea that education is key to more women reaching positions of power has not materialized."" In Lebanon, for example, women make up 54% of university students, but only 26% of the labor force and 8% of legislators, senior officials and managers, according to the United Nations Statistics Division. Qatar has the region's second highest percentage of women in higher education -- 63% of the university population, and 93% literacy among women. However, women make up just 12% of the labor force and only 7% of legislators, senior officials and managers, the same statistics show. In Europe and the United States, women also make up the majority of university graduates -- 60% according to the European Union and U.S. Department of Education. However, women made up 40.5% of the global labor force in 2008, according to International Labor Organization statistics. The factors driving young women to seek a university education are not also driving them into the workplace, Dabbous-Sensenig said. Also read: Saudi female entrepreneurs . ""In some Gulf countries I think many women go to university to find a better husband or to fill time before they get married. ""Lack of protection for women at work and harassment are among the factors that keep women out of the workplace."" For others, university is a luxury unavailable to men who are expected to become breadwinners. ""Some men can't go to higher education because they need to make money as soon as they leave school,"" said Dabbous-Sensenig. ""Fewer men go on to masters degrees than women because it's too many years before they can start working."" Nawar Al-Hassan Golley, Associate Professor in Literary Theory and Women's Studies at the American University of Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, said both the high percentage of women in university and their absence from the workforce can be explained in the social upbringing of girls. ""Girls and boys continue to be socialized very differently with different expectations,"" she said. ""Boys have more personal freedoms to go outside the home, whereas girls continue to be socialized within the home. ""Therefore, for many girls school is their only opportunity to make friends and socialize outside the family, so it is something they look forward to.

"Washington (CNN) -- Six months after a gunman burst into a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school and slaughtered 20 children and killed six others, promises of stricter national gun control laws remain largely unfulfilled. And though the families of those lost made yet another pilgrimage to Washington this week to plead for action in meetings with the two top House Republicans, it is highly unlikely that lawmakers will act. After the meeting Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner said the discussions were ""very good."" Boehner declined to say much more about the discussion with the group, but Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who was also at the meeting, told reporters, ""I was struck again by the incredible pain that they are going through. I just can't imagine as a parent that kind of pain. My heart goes out to them."" Backers of gun control proposals were unable to advance legislation in the Senate centered on expanded background checks earlier this year, even after a high-profile push. The House never took up the measures. President Barack Obama lashed out when the Senate effort faltered, calling the defeat a ""pretty shameful day for Washington."" The political climate isn't right. Politically vulnerable moderate Democrats eyeing the 2014 midterm elections don't want to risk political capital by voting to pass both an immigration overhaul and comprehensive gun control legislation, said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's recent move to discourage funding the four Democratic senators who voted against shoring up background checks on gun sales will largely amount to a ""symbolic"" gesture, Gergen said. Two of the four -- Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, and Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, -- are facing re-election in 2014. Leading Democrats are also dubious about the overall impact of such a move. ""The only way to pass a background check bill is to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate, and any efforts that make that less likely are counterproductive,"" said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""Ninety percent of Democrats agree with the 90% of Americans who support background checks, and a Republican majority would guarantee that no background check bill passes in the foreseeable future,"" he said. There's also no incentive for the Republican-controlled House to take up gun control as an issue. That chamber's leaders have said they won't bring the matter up until the Senate acts. In either case, it seems as if the nation has moved on. Though national polls taken after the Newtown shooting showed that roughly 90% of Americans supported some form of universal background checks, less than half of those polled were upset by the Senate's failure to pass that type of measure, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. ""I'm afraid the moment has probably passed,"" Gergen said. After the Newtown shooting, gun control advocates redoubled their efforts with a nation mourning the loss of school children. The issue also galvanized the Obama administration. However, they have thus-far been outmatched by efforts of a powerful gun lobby and a motivated and vocal interest group, the National Rifle Association, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. However, this year's defeat may could still result in eventual legislative change, Vernick said. In the absence of congressional action on a slate of gun control measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to expanded background checks, many states have taken matters into their own hands. While some states like Connecticut and New York have strengthened laws, others have done the opposite. Undaunted by congressional inaction, the White House is still pushing for tighter laws. Vice President Joe Biden recently shared his confidence that Congress will act with fellow Democrats in an e-mail and chastised Republicans during a recent fundraiser for not supporting expanded background checks for gun sales. Biden is also holding a gun control event at the White House next week. Biden, a former senator, and Reid are also reportedly in talks on how best to resurrect related legislation. ""I am not going to bring up a vote just to have a vote,"" Reid said last week. ""I want to bring up this vote again if we can accomplish something that seems pretty common sense to me. If you have severe mental problems or you are a criminal you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. That's what, I agree with 90% of the American people, we should get this done."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Six months after Newtown, gun-control legislation has stalled despite public support .

"(CNN) -- For the second time in three years, the African city of Luanda has been declared the most expensive city in the world for expats by Mercer, a human resources consulting firm. While it's true that most of the Angolan capital's population lives in poverty on the outskirts of the city, in the center, Porsche Cayennes share the road with Cadillac Escalades and the latest Range Rovers. Hugo Boss makes such a killing here that it opened a second store within walking distance of the first. For those not familiar with Luanda, however, the ranking may come as a surprise. Tokyo (which took top spot in Mercer's survey last year) makes sense as the world's most expensive expat city. So might Moscow or New York. But Luanda? What's it like to visit? So, what's this scandalously expensive place -- where a mid-level expat professional might earn $10,000 a month -- like to visit? First, some context. Luanda is the capital of Africa's second largest oil producer, Angola (Nigeria beats it), a rising political and economic powerhouse. Yet the country also suffered a destructive and violent 27-year civil war, ending only in 2002, which crippled its infrastructure and decimated its ability to produce its own food. As a consequence, almost everything in Luanda has to be imported. Heavy import duties, along with high taxes and monopolized supply chains linked to the powerful political elite further drive up the price of goods and services to astronomical levels. Then there's institutional corruption, which creates high prices through price fixing and price collusion. Sky-high hotel bills . Hotels are the visitor's biggest expense. Despite more opening in recent years, prices have remained stuck at about $500 a night for five-star hotels, $350-400 for four-stars and $300-350 for mid-level lodging. A meal at Luanda's smartest restaurants will easily top $100 per person, including appetizers and drinks. Such prices can be supported only by expats working for multinational companies and wealthy Angolans who work for the country's burgeoning oil and banking sectors. Most Luandans, by contrast, live on the city's periphery and make vastly inferior incomes. While a mid-level banking professional might take home $8,000-$10,000 a month, a driver or housemaid makes $500 a month, if the boss is feeling generous. Luxury car traffic jams may be a common sight in the capital, but the roads are appalling and public services -- from driver's license renewal to the post -- are horrendous. (Perhaps send your postcards after leaving the country.) Still keen to go? Luanda is a dynamic, albeit challenging, place to visit and one you're unlikely to forget. But it doesn't have to be prohibitively expensive -- if you know where to look. A 'cheap' day and a night . Say you're in Luanda for a day and a night. You'll need a hotel: Epic Sana Luanda (Rua da Missão, Mutamba; +244 222 642 600; from $500 a night) is considered the best in the city, with prices to match, while Executive Hotel Samba (Rua da Samba s/n, Samba, Luanda; +244 915407117; from $300), offers rare decent value, all things considered. As soon as you step out of the hotel door, the only way to avoid a cash hemorrhage is to follow the age-old expat line and start living like a local. The city doesn't have much in the way of museums and public parks, but it's worth walking along the recently refurbished Marginal, the seafood promenade that stretches from the local port to the Ilha, the peninsula jutting into Luanda Bay. If you do, keep an eye on the imposing, whitewashed Portuguese fort perched on a hill overlooking the city; once you get close, take a left, go up the hill and you'll find an armed forces museum (+244 222 373 623) located inside the structure. Beach life . Beaches are a must in Angola in summer. Near Luanda, Mussulo Island is a spit of land with thatch-roofed restaurants and hotel bungalows on one side and miles of deserted beach, with fantastic waves, on the other. You can catch water taxis out to Mussulo at the Embarcadouro dock ($5) and spend the day there. Another option is to get out of Luanda altogether and head 40 kilometers south to the Miradouro da Lua, a beautiful landscape of cliffs, pinnacles and valleys stretching toward the horizon. Dotted with baobab trees, the long, empty savanna will make you question why everyone stays crammed in the city. At Cabo Ledo, about 150 kilometers south of Luanda, you'll find some of the country's finest beaches, excellent for surfing. Angolan cuisine . Angola has a culinary tradition influenced by 500 years of Portuguese colonization and seafood from more than a thousand kilometers of coastline. In the Mutamba, Luanda's central business district, a good spot for lunch is Tendinha (Rua da Missão 16, Mutamba; +244 923 542 868), a friendly Angolan bistro where the beer is cold and the food is cheap. It's within walking distance of some of the city's most popular hotels and the average check is $20. At Ilha, where many of the city's best restaurants are located, two low-key favorites are Casa do Peixa da Gabela (Rua Massano de Amorim, Chicala) and Restaurante da Dona Bela (Rua Massano de Amorim, after Poupalá on your left side; it has blue walls and white bars on the outside). At both places you can eat a feast -- featuring excellent mufete, a local delicacy of beans stewed in palm oil, grilled tilapia, onion vinaigrette, boiled plantains, sweet potatoes and yucca -- for about $17. For dinner, on the fringes of central Luanda in the Bairro Popular you can try the excellent cuisine of Angolan master chef Rui Sá at his Restaurante & Bar 688 (Rua da Janela Aberta, Bairro Popular, Luanda; +244 943 256 193). Entrees here rarely top the $30 mark, and if they do it's because you're getting enough food for two. Splurge time . And if you want to splurge -- this is the world's most expensive city, after all -- Lookal Mar (Rua Murtala Mohamed 15, Ilha do Cabo, Luanda; +244 936 000 018/9) is the king of Luanda restaurants. Entrees here can cost $150 -- seafood is flown in from Portugal three times a week. You're spoiled for choice if you want to prolong your night in Luanda. The city's new nightlife darling is the Switch Supper Club, in the bowels of the Epic Sana Hotel. But you could skip the $40 minimum spend there and experience true Luanda nightlife at the W Club -- where there's all kinds of music, a welcoming crowd and the $20 cover includes three drinks.

"(CNN) -- Ever since the 2003 invasion of Iraq exposed deep-rooted religious and ethnic divisions, analysts have suggested giving up on the colonial-era borders of modern Iraq and dividing the country. Jihadists have felt the opposite, that the region should be united into a new caliphate -- indeed that is precisely what the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) declared this week. Both are wrong. The lines drawn by the British and French colonial powers in 1916 became, after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the borders of new Arab states. Over the years, these lines splitting the Levant into Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq have been enormously contentious, to the extent that it is often argued the region might be better without them. Either removing these lines altogether and returning to the world of the early 20th century, or drawing them smaller and tighter still. Certainly the idea of closer union among the Arab countries has been tried, in various forms, over the decades since the close of the Second World War. But what should work in theory hasn't worked in practice -- the most ambitious attempt, the United Arab Republic, practically destroyed liberal, secular politics for a generation. Conversely, the lines in the sand of Sykes-Picot, which should not have worked in practice, have held, broadly, for decades. That doesn't mean they are perfect. But at a time of immense upheaval in the Middle East, they may be better than the alternative. The end of the caliphate necessitated a new search for political organization in the region. But if the joining together of all the Arab lands in a new caliphate is not a realistic answer to the real political questions of the Middle East, nor is the oft-proposed division of Iraq into smaller statelets. Dividing Iraq . Ever since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the division of Iraq into three parts -- roughly, a Kurdish north, a Sunni middle and a Shia south -- has been proposed earnestly, often by people with barely any knowledge of the region, its peoples and societies. The casualness with which the suggestion of such an immense change is made mirrors the callous approach taken by the colonial surveyors who first drew these borders, seeking to change the lives of nations with the stroke of a pen. As recently as 2006, the U.S. vice-president Joseph Biden argued that Iraq should be partitioned, and even the German foreign minister, two weeks ago, in a tone that suggests he was simply exasperated with the complexity of the situation, said it might be difficult to prevent Iraq splitting apart. Such a project, however, faces immense technical as well as human challenges, which are rarely addressed. Any division of Iraq has to take into account people, politics and economics. In the most often suggested scenario, the northern Kurdish region would take the oil-fields around Kirkuk in the north, the Shia state would take the capital Baghdad and the main port in the southern city of Basra, leaving a Sunni rump state in the west, denuded of resources with which to survive. Moreover, the new smaller Shia state in the south would come under Iran's influence, extending Tehran's reach into a state that would now border Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The idea that this division would solve anything is a dangerous fantasy. As things stand today, an attempt to divide Iraq would not occur calmly but would be a furious scramble for the country's resources, as well as a rush by Iraq's neighbors for influence over the three new states in their midst. It would not solve the problem. Rather it would entrench the failures of politicians, writing failed policies across the lines of a map. Mass migration . Moreover, drawing new borders along religious lines would mean a mass movement of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people. An estimated one million Iraqis are already on the move within Iraq, internally displaced from their homes. Any attempt to divide Iraq into different countries would mean many more. To ask or force so many to move, even from, say, Baghdad to Basra, would mean uprooting them from jobs, friends and families. It would need a strategy to ensure that there are sufficient jobs waiting, that there are schools for the children to attend, that there are apartments and houses for people to live in. Mass migration cannot be accomplished safely by speeches alone. Even with the most extensive planning, the results would likely be chaotic. As Feisal Istrabadi, former deputy Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, pointed out two weeks ago: ""If Iraq falls apart, it will not fall apart into three neat pieces. What you're much more likely to see is a Somalia in Iraq."" Iraqis are simply too mixed together. Even today, more than a decade after the invasion of Iraq, the same mistakes of understanding are made. One is to imagine a neat division of Sunnis, Shia and Kurds, mixing up ethnic and religious categories. The Kurds, after all, are mainly Sunni Muslims and both Sunni and Shia Muslims and Christians are Arabs. Add to that mix the other minorities of Iraq, the Yezidis, the Armenians, the Circassians. In a divided Iraq, where would they go? If the answer is that they could stay as minorities in the areas they currently live, why couldn't that formulation equally apply to Sunnis in Shia areas and Shia in Sunni areas? Another is to imagine that such neat distinctions continue in real life. In fact, until the Iraq war unleashed political forces that fanned the flames of sectarianism, the idea of division along sect or religion was broadly unknown in Iraq. Baghdad, like most of the big cities, was religiously mixed. 'Iraqis must make decision' It wasn't a utopia -- it was, after all, ruled by Saddam's iron fist -- but to imagine that life, for decades, was merely a bubbling cauldron of resentment waiting to explode is to do a great disservice to Iraqi society, defining it solely by its divisions, as if the lines of religion or ethnicity could never be surmounted. In fact, they were, both individually -- Sunnis and Shias married each other, as did Christians and Muslims -- and city-wide. Divisions in Iraq were, as in most countries of the world, more about economics than race or religion. None of that means that partitioning Iraq should not be considered. But it has to come with the understanding that it is Iraqis themselves who must make the decision and that rearranging what were lines in the sand is a serious business, because the new borders will have to be drawn across the bodies of real people. It is always easier to speak of division than to speak of good policy. But that is what is needed now. The colonial-era divisions were a mess. But seeking to change them now, at this moment, is a recipe for a generation of war. For better or worse, the Middle East is stuck with the lines drawn by Sykes-Picot.","Iraq's borders were mapped out by the British and French colonial powers during WWI .

"(CNN) -- Officially billed as The Woodstock Music and Art Fair, An Aquarian Exposition, the festival that came to be known, simply, as Woodstock is the stuff of legend. Friday marks the 45th anniversary of Woodstock, which took place from August 15-18, 1969. Woodstock didn't take place in Woodstock, New York, but in Bethel, about 60 miles away. ""It was really called Woodstock because (festival co-creator) Mike Lang thought it had the right vibe,"" Bob Spitz, journalist and author of ""Barefoot in Babylon: The Creation of the Woodstock Music Festival, 1969"" told CNN. ""Woodstock was where Bob Dylan lived,"" said Spitz, ""It's where The Band hung out and he just liked the whole feel of the word. No matter where they were gonna have it, it was always going to be the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Everything about Woodstock has to do with the vibe."" 2009: Folk singer Richie Havens remembers Woodstock . Max Yasgur provided Woodstock's venue by leasing out his 600-acre dairy farm near the hamlet of White Lake in the Catskill Mountain community of Bethel, New York, 100 miles north of Manhattan. The posters promised ""3 Days of Peace & Music,"" but the festival's initial concept ""depends on who you talk to,"" said Spitz. Lang and festival promoter Artie Kornfeld wanted to have a blowout that was ""the biggest party the counterculture had ever seen,"" said Spitz. ""If you talk to their partners, John Roberts and Joel Rosenman, who were the money guys, it was to make a lot of money."" For the crowd of 350,000 to 450,000 young people in attendance, Woodstock was all about peace and love, and that's no myth. ""The entire Woodstock festival was peaceful and the kids were respectful because of one word: marijuana,"" said Spitz. ""Everybody was high. If it had been other drugs it would've been chaos. But because of dope and LSD, everything was peaceful there for those three days."" Festival organizers who had been expecting a crowd of 80,000 to 100,000 people were blindsided when quadruple the crowd showed up. No one was prepared for a surplus of 300,000 people. With no system in place to charge them, Woodstock became a free event. Cars within a five-mile radius were at a standstill. New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller declared a state of emergency in White Lake. By Woodstock's second day, authorities publicly pleaded for anyone who might be on their way to the festival to turn around and go home. Eventually no one could get out or in unless they needed to be airlifted. Festival managers scrambled to fly in 30 extra physicians from New York City. Santana vocalist Gregg Rolie spoke to CNN while promoting the Blu-ray release of the director's cut of the 1970 Academy Award-winning documentary ""Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music."" Rolie recalled arriving with the other members of Santana via helicopter. ""We flew in because everybody parked on the highway,"" said Rolie. ""It was kinda like 'Close Encounters' or 'Field of Dreams,' you know? 'If you build it, they will come.' The highways were closed. Upstate New York was like a parking lot. So we had to fly in on helicopters."" Santana's appearance is considered one of the festival highlights. The band played early on, before the first of two downpours that reduced Yasgur's alfalfa field to a sloppy, slippery slew of mud puddles. All of Santana's music was new at the time and the band was virtually unknown. They had not yet released their first album. Woodstock is credited for jumpstarting Santana's career. ""If you played at Woodstock, you had a career,"" said Rolie, who had no idea that the festival's legacy would resonate so powerfully 45 years later. Woodstock's lineup also included Joan Baez, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; Joe Cocker, Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Band, among others. Jimi Hendrix closed the festival. By the time he began his Monday morning set, which included his celebrated rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" the crowd had thinned out to 200,000. Many had to get to work, school, wanted to get a jump on the traffic or simply could not endure the close quarters any longer. Even so, Hendrix had never performed in front of such a big group before and nearly bailed. Although Woodstock has been lifted onto a pedestal in certain ways, by all accounts the festival lived up to the fable. The fairy tale, though largely drug-laden, was a reality for those in attendance. iReport: Hazy memories of Woodstock . It can be difficult to connect the storybook reality with Woodstock's harsher realities like overflowed toilets, lack of food and water, and a makeshift, 20-bed hospital tent to accommodate roughly 3,000 medical emergencies. A tractor crushed a teenage boy in a sleeping bag, fatally wounding him. One young man died of a heroin overdose, another died of a burst appendix. A young woman broke her back falling off of stage scaffolding. In addition, there were about 400 bad acid trips, sprained ankles from sliding in the mud, and many a gashed foot as a result of stepping barefoot on broken glass. Two babies were born, too. One child arrived in traffic en route to the festival, and the other was delivered in a hospital after the mother was airlifted out of the field. A lot of sex was going on at Woodstock and, according to Spitz, a lot of women forgot to pack their birth control so supplies of birth control pills were flown in. For an event where facilities were strained far past capacity, not a single fight or incident of violence erupted among the crowd, which endured near-unbearable conditions. Town elders, residents, shopkeepers and local police couldn't get over how courteous and considerate the kids were -- all 450,000 or so of them. Woodstock's financial backers were not so lucky. They took a bath -- and not a mud one -- to the tune of $1.3 million. Spitz called Woodstock ""the beginning of the end of the '60s"" because it, along with the moon landing, represented a bright period after the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and before the breakup of the Beatles and the deaths of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. Woodstock is legendary for many reasons, but what made it magical was the value people placed on one another. ""If these are the kids that are going to inherit the world,"" Max Yasgur said at the time, ""I don't fear for it.""","The fabled Woodstock Music and Art Fair took place 45 years ago this week .
There were massive crowds and bands like The Grateful Dead .

"(CNN) -- Nicki Minaj isn't feeling welcomed at her old high school -- or at least that's what she's saying on Twitter. In a series of tweets posted on Thursday, the rapper implied that her former stomping grounds, New York's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High, turned down her request to speak to the school's students. ""I wanted to go back to my HS and speak to the students, but the new principal declined,"" Minaj said. ""No need for me to inspire them, I guess. ...

The ""Anaconda"" rapper's tweets suggest the school didn't give a reason for declining her appearance. (When asked directly whether she received an explanation, Minaj tweeted, ""not really."") LaGuardia High deferred all comment to the New York Department of Education, who explained that former graduates could return to the school unless it would interrupt the students' learning. ""Of course alumni are welcome back to our campuses and we love to celebrate their success, providing it does not interrupt the educational process,"" an official for the DOE said in a statement. ""Alumni visit all the time and address students. However, we do not allow reality TV to be filmed on school property. For documentaries, any visit to a public school must be educational in nature and cannot intrude on instruction."" It isn't yet clear if Minaj's appearance would have included reality TV cameras. Minaj's reps have not responded to a request for comment. Minaj wasn't the only one disappointed by the school's response.

"(CNN) -- Ray Rice is out of a job. An increasing number of critics think National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell, the man in charge of disciplining the star player, should be next. The commissioner told CBS News on Tuesday that he was sickened by what he saw on a newly released video that showed Rice knocking out his now-wife with a ferocious punch, but insisted that Monday was the first time he or anyone in NFL headquarters had seen the full scope of the February incident. He also deflected criticism of his handling of Rice's case and his initial lenient penalty for the Baltimore Ravens running back's act. When asked did he really need to see a video of the brutal knockout punch to decide on the length of Rice's punishment, the commissioner said, ""No."" ""What we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself,"" Goodell said, referring to another video that surfaced in February after the incident, showing Rice dragging his fiancee, Janay, out of the elevator. ""But what we saw yesterday was extremely clear. It was extremely graphic and it was sickening."" The new footage from inside an Atlantic City hotel elevator prompted Goodell to suspend the veteran player indefinitely. It also made many sports commentators even angrier about the league's botched reaction to the incident -- an initial two-game suspension for Rice -- something Goodell has admitted he didn't get right. Outspoken ESPN personality Keith Olbermann called Goodell an ""enabler of men who beat women"" and demanded the commissioner resign or be fired. ""Mr. Goodell's ineptitude has not merely rendered this football season meaningless and irrelevant by contrast, it has not only reduced supporting or watching football to a distasteful, even a disrespectful act, but most importantly it has comforted the violent and afflicted the victim,"" Olbermann opined Monday. ""His push to increase NFL punishment of domestic abusers to roughly that one-third that of repeat pot smokers, his decision today to suspend Rice indefinitely, after the Ravens had fired him, are elements of classic tragedy, wherein the right thing is finally done only after it's too late to matter."" San Francisco Chronicle sport columnist Ann Killion agreed. ""Roger Goodell should follow Rice out the door -- his leadership has no integrity and no longer can be trusted by the public. He should resign,"" she wrote. Goodell told CBS that the league assumed an in-elevator video existed and asked law enforcement for it, but was never given the opportunity to view it. It wasn't until Monday, when he arrived at the office and staffers told him there was something he needed to see, that he viewed the video. Former NFL quarterback Sage Rosenfels, in a column posted on Football by Football, blamed Goodell for a colossal failure, but didn't call for him to step down. ""Roger Goodell is powerful. He is connected. He has unlimited resources at his disposal. He can make things happen. He didn't do his job. He failed in epic proportions,"" Rosenfels wrote. In a tweet, the former player wrote of suspending Rice indefinitely: ""Roger Goodell made $44 million last year to make really difficult decisions. This was an easy one."" Goodell has admitted that his initial two-game suspension of Rice was the wrong decision. He said so when he announced a new policy penalizing acts of violence like domestic abuse or sexual assault. The new rules meant a minimum six-game ban, but the penalty didn't apply to Rice's case. The policy was greeted with commendations, but the fact that Rice was going to be back in uniform soon even though the league knew he had knocked Janay Rice unconscious drew loud condemnation. The criticism intensified after the new video surfaced Monday. ""Goodell elected himself the league's top cop. Is he Barney Fife?"" wrote ESPN's Jason Whitlock. ""Did he not talk to the police or hotel security personnel who saw the tape?"" Goodell told CBS that he wasn't going to step down and that criticism was an everyday part of the position. Did NFL do what it could to see video? While the league said it never saw the new video until it was posted online, many question whether the NFL tried hard enough to view it before Monday. TMZ ran a story Tuesday, citing anonymous sources, saying the NFL never asked the casino for the video, and had it asked, the video would have been handed over. Reacting to that report, NFL officials said they asked state police for evidence related to the case, but authorities did not give the video to them. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that security for Atlantic City casinos is handled by New Jersey State Police. In a statement to CNN on Tuesday, McCarthy said: ""Any videos related to an ongoing criminal investigation are held in the custody of the state police. As we said yesterday: We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including the video from inside the elevator. That video was not made available to us."" Coy Wire, a former NFL player-turned-Fox sports analyst, told CNN that he doubted the NFL was unaware of the TMZ video. The NFL should have done more to find it, he insisted. ""There should have been a way for them to find out,"" he said. ""And if not, well then, they need to hire someone from TMZ to do the investigative services for them because I think that's absurd. ""For them to not make a concerted effort to find out what really happened inside the elevator, it baffles me."" Former Ravens offensive lineman Wally Williams said that he agrees. ""They (the NFL) are just trying to save themselves on this one,"" he said. ""I think they all had an opportunity to see this video."" In June, Goodell met with Rice and his wife at the NFL office in New York to hear their versions of what happened. Janay Rice reportedly sat beside her husband as she described what happened. After hearing that and taking another month to evaluate the evidence the league had gathered, Goodell suspended Rice for two games of a 16-game season. He also was to forfeit a third game's pay -- reportedly a total of $529,411. Now Rice's career appears all but over. After the in-elevator video surfaced, he was released by the Ravens and was suspended indefinitely by the NFL. He's not even eligible to play in the Canadian Football League, which honors NFL bans. Goodell, however, told CBS it would be possible for Rice to make an NFL comeback if the running back proved he had addressed the domestic violence issue and that he had paid a price for his actions. The commissioner would have to lift his suspension. A league spokesman said Monday that the commissioner's office would want to provide direction on any potential new contract. Players blast Goodell . Other players and former competitors have expressed their disgust about the entire matter on Twitter. Green Bay Packer T.J. Lang on Monday tweeted, ""2 games. Disturbing.""

"(CNN) -- They are known as the hippies of the ape kingdom, a peaceful and affectionate species that is more interested in making love than killing each other. One of the world's rarest apes, bonobos are close cousins of chimpanzees and share 98.7% of human DNA. But unlike their ape relatives -- and humans -- bonobos shy away from engaging in vicious conflicts. Instead, they share food, groom each other and use a variety of sexual activities to build relationships, promote social bonding and strengthen alliances. It is, then, an ironic twist that the very existence of this affable species has come under threat by decades of war and deforestation in one of Africa's most troubled parts. Found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the bonobos inhabit the country's lowland rainforests along the south bank of the Congo River. See also: School boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . In recent months, tensions erupted once again in the vast country as rebels launched a major attack in the violence-riddled eastern part of the DRC. Although the bonobo habitat is located several hundred miles away from the epicenter of the crisis, conservationists say that the country's instability over the years has made it almost impossible to study bonobos and find out where they are or determine how many are left. At the same time, the expansion of the commercial bushmeat trade -- the selling of wild animal meat, such as that of the endangered bonobo -- threatens the survival of the apes even further. ""The decade of war in the late 1990s resulted in extensive population displacement, military/rebel movements and a greater availability of firearms and ammunition, which contributed to increased hunting of wildlife, including bonobos,"" says Dominique Morel, of Friends of Bonobos, a group supporting Lola Ya Bonobo, the world's first and only sanctuary for the endangered species. Born of necessity from the increasing threat of the bushmeat trade, Lola Ya Bonobo was founded in the mid-1990s by Claudine Andre, a Belgian-born conservationist who was working at the time as a volunteer in Kinshasa's zoo. It was there that Andre, who moved with her veterinarian father to Congo at the age of three, saw a bonobo for the first time -- an encounter that was destined to change her life forever. See also: Beethoven in the Congo . Andre, a mother of five, fell in love with the bonobos and started to rescue them one by one by taking them home with her. But soon she found herself needing a bigger space as the number of bonobos she took under her wing started to grow. The Congolese government eventually stepped in to help set up a more permanent home that would become Lola Ya Bonobo. The sanctuary, which is located just outside Kinshasa in some 30 hectares of primary forest, is today home to at least 65 bonobos, many of which are young orphans that have been either rescued from the wild or brought in after hunters killed their parents. ""Bushmeat never stops,"" says Andre. ""We have no solution and we receive more and more orphans every year."" An important part of the sanctuary's work is rehabilitating injured bonobos from the forest and, hopefully, one day returning them to the wild. ""Conservation asks us to make a test for reintroduction in the wild,"" says Andre. ""So we make this experience two times already since 2009, a group of bonobos from here, returned to the wild. And for them it was a success because after two-three months, they are home."" See also: Will elephants still roam earth in 20 years? The sanctuary also aims to educate the public about bonobos. Staff at Lola Ya Bonobo say that some 40,000 people come through its doors each year, including tourists and local schoolchildren, as well as graduate students conducting research on everything from bonobo behaviour to the evolution of the human brain. Conservationists say stability in the DRC is essential to ensure that bonobo conservation programs are not jeopardized. ""Advocating for wildlife conservation is always a battle in a country as poor as the DRC,"" says Morel. ""In times of crisis, when the security and basic needs of civilian populations are often not assured, it becomes even more challenging. If eco-guards and staff have to be evacuated from certain areas for their own safety, equipment, infrastructure and sometimes animals suffer. ""Only with peace and stability can long-term investments in wildlife conservation -- research, conservation education, community-based habitat protection and eco-tourism -- be successfully implemented.""","The endangered bonobo is only found in the Democratic Republic of Congo .

"Denver (CNN) -- Once relegated to sleazy red-light districts and the darker corners of the Internet, porn stars are now gaining followings in a surprising place: Twitter. They are using the social media site to engage directly with their fans and build their individual brands . ""Twitter has opened up these porn stars fan bases like nothing the adult film industry has ever seen before,"" said Dan Miller, managing editor of XBiz, an adult industry trade publication. ""Since most mainstream pop culture publications don't cover the porn industry (and) porn movie reviews don't generally appear alongside reviews of big Hollywood movies ... the adult industry has embraced Twitter as a way to reach out directly to fans beyond the typical porn consumer."" Miller estimates that 90% of porn performers are on Twitter, and he believes it is essential for new performers to use social media effectively to promote themselves and build their ""brand."" Porn stars showcase all-American success? ""If you're not on Twitter, you are definitely at a disadvantage right out of the gate,"" he said. Alexander Raymond Palumbo was one of the first executives in the adult entertainment business to embrace social media, first on Friendster, then Myspace and now on Twitter. ""Via our social media platforms like Twitter I'm trying to establish brand loyalty, like people have for a company like Disney,"" said Palumbo, a social media strategist at Digital Playground, an adult movie production company. Palumbo holds seminars for adult movie actors, helping them set up their accounts and guiding them on how to tweet in a way that will connect them to their audience by engaging directly with fans and showing some of their personal sides to their followers. ""I try to instill in performers that you should let people know who you are, invite them into your interaction,"" he said. Palumbo begins his work day by logging onto Twitter to gauge reaction from the fans to his company's movies and performers. If viewers of a new movie trailer tweet that there is too much emphasis on male characters, Palumbo will make a call to the edit department asking for changes. ""Twitter is like an instant focus group,"" explained Palumbo. ""It's not going to go away, it is the future. From our company's point of view, it's pure customer service."" Social media is profoundly changing the porn business, according to Chauntelle Tibbals, a visiting scholar at University of Southern California who studies the porn industry. ""Before it was about pure fantasy: you didn't have enough information to be real fans of performers,"" she said. ""But now you can become a true fan of a porn star."" The performers who are successful on Twitter are the ones who open themselves up and share parts of their non-professional life with fans, allowing followers a window into their off-camera personalities. ""That kind of interaction is something you don't see mainstream celebrities doing to the same degree,"" according to Tibbals. ""You don't see Angelina Jolie tweeting directly to people."" Many of the performers are surprisingly funny, smart and engaging on Twitter. While they all promote their movies, most focus more on their hobbies, current events and personal lives. ""You are seeing a different kind of relationship that a viewer has with a porn performer,"" Tibbals said. ""One of the things that comes with social media is the deconstruction of stereotypes."" Social media has the power to change how the public views porn stars, according to Tibbals, and it may ultimately make porn more mainstream and socially acceptable. Here are several adult film stars who are using Twitter to attract a wider audience: . Putting your 'erotic capital' to work . The Boy Next Door: @JamesDeen . James Deen is arguably the hottest male performer in the porn industry. At 26 years old, he has already appeared in over 1,200 movies. He has made a name for himself by defying stereotypes about male porn stars: he comes off as a funny, slightly goofy boy-next-door. His non-threatening demeanor has made his films popular with younger woman and has led him to more mainstream opportunities. Deen is currently working on a Hollywood movie called ""The Canyons,"" in which he is co-starring with Lindsay Lohan. The film is directed by Paul Shrader, who is known for writing ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" The movie is slated to premier in 2013. Deen credits Twitter with helping his transition to mainstream films. ""I think a lot of the mainstream thing has to do with Twitter,"" he told CNN. ""People look at me and they say, 'He's not a porn star, he's just a nice guy."" His approach to Twitter is simple: be yourself. ""I like to keep my Twitter very personal and used as a random outlet for my feelings,"" Deen said. ""I see no reason to be involved except to be myself."" Despite his non-commercial approach to Twitter, he said being an effective tweeter is an essential part of his business. ""The way the world is going, you have to be able to communicate with your market, know about your demographic, know what people are clicking on and then communicate back to them,"" Deen said. The Internet's Girlfriend: @danadearmond . Dana DeArmond describes herself as a ""pornographer of the people"" and is one of the most accessible adult performers on Twitter. She responds to most of her followers who post a comment or question, often with a smart-alecky remark. ""People like to laugh and they like to know that people who are sex workers can also be smart and funny,"" said DeArmond, who occasionally performs stand-up comedy around Los Angeles. DeArmond, 33, says the porn world is extremely competitive and she uses Twitter to differentiate herself from other performers by interacting directly with her fans. ""I've developed the moniker 'the Internet's girlfriend' and tried to make a more personal connection with the people who found me and followed me,"" she said. . ""It's something I've used in my branding. It's like 'OK, if you don't have a real girlfriend you can pretend I'm your girlfriend on the Internet and I won't treat you like a customer.' That's how I brand myself."" DeArmond describes the porn industry as an ""ever-changing animal"": viewers' relationship with the product and their expectations of the performers are ""constantly evolving and now requires a much more personal approach by performers."" ""Porn is not a utilitarian thing; if it were there would already have been enough porn made forever,"" she said. ""People have a connection to it and Twitter helps me make that connection."" The Smartest Woman in Porn: @Kayden_Kross . Perhaps the most surprising porn figure to emerge on Twitter is Kayden Kross. With her dyed blonde hair and pouty lips she certainly looks the part of an adult film star. When she's not making porn movies, Kross tweets about her very non-pornographic passions: books and horses. ""People seem to be surprised with the things I'm into,"" she told CNN. She often tweets about her favorite authors, David Foster Wallace and Don DeLillo. Between shoots in the San Fernando Valley, she travels to New York where she is taking a series of writing classes with legendary editor Gordon Lish, noted for his work with authors Raymond Carver and Richard Ford. ""The porn people could care less who I'm reading,"" Kross said. ""I have a slim sliver of fans based on a common passion for books and the written word. Those are who I interact with."" She is working on a novel set in the world of porn and posts essays on her website and tweets them out to her followers. ""If you're interacting with people, you're putting part of your soul into it,"" she said. ""The people that understand me the best are people into writing."" Back in Los Angeles, Kross enjoys spending time with her horses. In April, her mare Regina gave birth and Kross tweeted throughout the process, posting pictures and even asking her followers to help name the foal. Despite the situation having nothing to do with her porn life, her Twitter followers were with her all the way, tweeting congratulations and piping in with suggestions for names. She ultimately settled on the name Maya. Although many of her tweets are on her hobbies, Kross says that Twitter has been the key to her success in the porn world. ""I was largely unsuccessful up until Twitter came along because I'm very shy ... and it came through in my movies,"" she said. ""But with Twitter, people see a different side of me and they see it in my movies."" Twitter allows Kross to defy people's preconceived notions of what porn stars are like and be more comfortable both on camera and off. ""Twitter has made me more confident as a person and a performer,"" she said.","Twitter has become a way for adult film stars to define themselves .

"(CNN) -- Iran plans to send ships near the Atlantic coast of the United States, state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday, quoting a commander. ""The Navy of the Iranian Army will have a powerful presence near the United States borders,"" read the headline of the story, in Farsi. ""Commander of the Navy of the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran broke the news about the plans for the presence of this force in the Atlantic Ocean and said that the same way that the world arrogant power is present near our marine borders, we, with the help of our sailors who follow the concept of the supreme jurisprudence, shall also establish a powerful presence near the marine borders of the United States,"" the story said. The reference to the ""world arrogant power"" was presumably intended to refer to the United States. IRNA cited the force's website as saying that the announcement was made by Adm. Habibollah Sayari on the 31st anniversary of the Iran-Iraq war. State-run Press TV said Sayari had announced similar plans in July. In February, two Iranian Navy ships traversed the Suez Canal in the first such voyages by Iranian ships since 1979. U.S. Defense Department officials had no immediate reaction to Tuesday's announcement. The United States has deployed fleets to the Persian Gulf in the past. State-run Press TV, citing IRNA, said Tuesday's announcement came as Iran also plans to send its 16th fleet of warships to the Gulf of Aden to protect Iranian vessels and oil tankers from pirates, who have hijacked dozens of ships and exchanged their crews for ransom. The Islamic Republic has repeatedly assured that its military might poses no threat to other countries, stating that Tehran's defense doctrine is based only on deterrence, Press TV reported in a story in July about the deployment of submarines to international waters.

"(CNN) -- The family of Kendrick Johnson -- the south Georgia teen found dead in his high school gym a year ago -- has filed a lawsuit against the funeral home that handled his remains, alleging negligence and fraud. The lawsuit revolves around what the owner and employees of Harrington Funeral Home in Valdosta, Georgia, knew about the state of the young man's body. Johnson's parents were shocked to learn in June, when they ordered a second autopsy, that the young man's organs were missing and had been replaced with newspaper. An investigation by a state board found that the handling of the body by the funeral home did not violate the law. Roy Copeland, a lawyer for Harrington Funeral Home and its owner, Antonio Harrington, said his client had not been served as of Wednesday and could not comment on something he has not seen. In the lawsuit, filed January 31 and amended Wednesday, the family alleges that not only did the funeral home mishandle the organs, it disposed of them to thwart an investigation into Johnson's cause of death. ""This lawsuit challenges the morally despicable, fraudulent, unlawful and unfair business practices"" of Harrington Funeral Home, the court document states. Antonio Harrington ""intentionally, willfully and secretly"" desecrated Johnson's remains, the lawsuit claims. It was a fraud intended to mislead and make it difficult to establish the manner and cause of death, the lawsuit alleges. The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office has repeatedly stood by its original determination that Johnson died by accident after getting caught up reaching for his shoe that fell inside a rolled-up gym mat. CNN examined the 522-page police file and found that investigators spoke to 111 people, including 18 on the day Johnson's body was found. But the disbelieving Johnson family pushed in court, leading to a judge's decision May 1 to grant their request to exhume their son's body for an independent autopsy at their expense. It was during that second autopsy that the missing organs were noticed. The doctor who carried out that autopsy determined that Johnson suffered blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues, ""consistent with inflicted injury,"" challenging the authorities' ruling that the death was accidental. The lawsuit alleges that Harrington not only was aware that organs were missing, but ""actively undertook measures to dispose of said organs in an effort to interfere"" with the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who was convicted of domestic violence this summer, did not play Sunday in his team's win over the Detroit Lions. The news comes amid increased focus on the National Football League and the way it handles players accused of domestic violence. Until the team's surprising announcement just before game time, Hardy was set to play Sunday. Ray Rice, recently released by the Baltimore Ravens, and Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson won't play either. Peterson was placed on the inactive list late last week after he was indicted by a grand jury in Texas on a child abuse charge. He tweeted a photo on Sunday of a highlighted religious devotion that cautions people against passing judgment. Rice, meanwhile, might never play again, since the NFL suspended him indefinitely after a video was posted online that showed him punching out his now-wife in February. 'Zero applause for the Panthers' Authorities say Hardy in May choked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors with which he was charged. The 6-foot-4, 275 pound defensive end says he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict rendered by a Mecklenburg County judge in North Carolina. Critics had wondered how Rice could be suspended while Hardy had not. Even after the Panthers deactivated him Sunday, it was too little too late for some. ""Zero applause for the Panthers,"" Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch tweeted. ""They ceded to press/public pressure. It was disgrace it took this long."" 'Climate has changed' The Panthers drew heated criticism over its handling of Hardy even while speaking out against domestic violence. Owner Jerry Richardson, while accepting a civic award last week, began to cry while speaking about domestic violence. ""When it comes to domestic violence, my stance is not one of indifference. I stand firmly against domestic violence, plain and simple,"" he told the audience in Charlotte. ""To those who would suggest we've been too slow to act, I ask that you consider not to be too quick to judge."" Although he did not mention the words ""domestic violence"" in his post-game remarks, Panthers coach Ron Rivera obliquely acknowledged the controversy looming over not just Hardy, but over the entire league. ""The climate has changed,"" he said. ""We really do have to get this right. Believe me. I understand that"" Harsher penalties for domestic violence . In the wake of the Ray Rice incident, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced more severe punishment guidelines to the NFL's personal conduct policy. According to an August 28 memo sent by Goodell to all 32 teams, anyone in the league -- players or team personnel -- will be suspended for a minimum of six games for a first offense of domestic violence. Players are granted the opportunity to appeal. Ray Rice has until midnight Tuesday to file his appeal, if he chooses to do so. What's not clear is whether the NFL would apply these new guidelines retroactively, which is perhaps one explanation as to why Hardy -- sentenced a month before Goodell's memo -- has not yet been dealt with by the NFL. Another explanation could be that the league is waiting for the legal process to play itself out. Hardy has another trial scheduled for November. CNN reached out to the NFL Sunday but had not immediately heard back. Meanwhile, Hardy will continue be paid while he is on the inactive list.

"(CNN) -- A 27-year-old man with a history of mental illness was detained after he jumped a fence at Tampa International Airport Monday evening and ran onto an active runway. The man, who was not hurt, was given a trespass warning and taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation, airport spokeswoman Janet Zink told CNN. The man was apprehended within three minutes after he crossed the fence, Zink said. Zink said the man jumped a fence shortly after 5 p.m. and ran toward Runway 1 Right. He was observed by an employee of an airplane maintenance company, who called 911, she said. Air traffic controllers, pilots and airport police were recorded talking about the event on LiveATC.net tapes. ""How about the guy over here walking on the runway,"" one pilot said. ""I have no knowledge of that, but I think I see something now,"" the controller responds, before instructing a Southwest flight taxiing to the runway to stop. ""He's got his arms up ... he's walking northbound on the runway."" A police officer then asks for clearance to enter the runway to apprehend the man. ""That's something you don't see every day, tower,"" another pilot radioed. ""No you don't,"" the controller responded.

"(CNN) -- The entire world, it seems, is angry at America. Allegations of electronic spying by the U.S. National Security Agency have reached far and wide. People everywhere -- friends and foes -- feel the American government breathing behind them, its eyes burning just over their shoulder. As America's European allies gather to discuss how to respond to the latest news of U.S. spying, it is clear the time has come for Washington to take much more meaningful action to address the allegations. The fallout over electronic spying has becoming serious and costly. Already Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff canceled a trip to Washington -- even after President Barack Obama personally appealed to her -- in protest after reports of eavesdropping. The continuing drip of revelations from Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who fled the United States with a trove of secret information about America's intelligence practices, has become more than an irritant and distraction. When news is made public that the United States has been listening in, recording, saving information without authorization, governments are under pressure to respond. Relations are harmed. The price can easily exceed the benefits. It is time to rethink the decision-making process in America's gigantic electronic surveillance structure and to become more selective about how the United States will use its surveillance resources and manpower. First, though, it's worth noting that the United States is not the first or the only country to engage in massive spying. The practice is older than the Bible, which tells many a tale of surreptitious intelligence gathering. The ancient Chinese, Greek and Romans engaged in spying, and today practically every country does it. But spying technology has changed the landscape. It's now possible to gather almost unlimited amounts of information about practically everyone on Earth. At the same time, technology has also made it possible for just one well-positioned person to unveil all the virtual microphones to the world. That means intelligence gathering is easier and cheaper than ever. But it also means there's a greater chance of getting caught. This hasn't stopped intelligence chiefs the world over from forging ahead with data collection. Spy masters in many capitals are shifting uncomfortably in their chairs, hearing their government and their nation's citizens complain about U.S. spying that looks a lot like what they do. In the Netherlands, a government report last year said one in every 1,000 phones in the country is tapped by the government. The point of the official Dutch report was to complain that phone tapping is an inefficient and antiquated method. A few days ago, the French daily Le Monde published a detailed account of American eavesdropping in France. The French people were indignant. The response from the government was more muted. The reason is simple: French intelligence does pretty much the same thing the NSA does, engaging in large scale ""metadata"" collection. In fact, Le Monde a few months ago revealed the French General Directorate for External Security has been collecting massive amounts of private information. ""The entirety of our communications are being spied on,"" said the newspaper. ""All of our e-mail messages, SMS messages, itemized phone bills and connections to Facebook and Twitter are then stored for years."" Sound familiar? That's exactly what Snowden's first accounts revealed the United States as doing. We had suspected it. Many people found it only normal and not particularly disturbing. Others felt deeply violated. Others still were unsure: The government must protect the country, and that means spying. But how far is too far? The NSA spying is driven by security concerns. It is a matter of national defense. Other countries have spied for security but also to gain an advantage in business or against domestic political challenges. Britain is defending itself against charges that it spied on Belgian firms. Canada has apologized to Brazil for spying on Brazilian companies. And Brazilian intelligence has engaged in spying for domestic political reasons. Spy chiefs are, more than anything, envious at the scale of surveillance the NSA has developed. This takes us back to a truth learned in childhood: The fact that everyone does it, or that so many do it, does not make it right. Personal privacy has been steadily disappearing -- a deeply unsettling trend. But just because we seem to be moving inexorably in that direction, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stop, review and decide if we should take action to stop it. There is no question that the United States faces very real security threats, and some spying is necessary and justified. The question is who should the government be allowed to target in its invasion of privacy, and who should make that decision? The existing system is far too lax. The latest reports allege that U.S. spying reached into the activities of America's allies, including German Chancellor Angela. Merkel called Obama, who denied the accusations, saying the United States ""is not monitoring and will not monitor"" her communications. But the reason spying charges are the main topic of discussion at the summit of European Union leaders -- America's allies -- is that Washington is not addressing the substance of the complaints. Personal assurances by Obama are not enough. The solution is not an apology but a change in current practices. As a starting point for rethinking the process, I suggest the establishment of an intelligence and privacy board, a group made up of individuals with strong knowledge of national defense, security, ethics, privacy and diplomacy. Let them, under strict clearance, review the decision-making process. What should America collect? Who should be targeted, what should be saved? When does the benefit outweigh the risk? If you leave the question to the spies, they will choose to record it all, to save it all. That's too easy, and it's too dangerous. Not surprisingly, it leaves everyone angry at America. Even if everybody else does it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Allies and enemies alike upset about extent of U.S. spying program .

"(CNN) -- When Linda Waterhouse was 16, she went out with a friend who had too much to drink and couldn't drive home. If her friend's car had been an automatic, there wouldn't have been a problem -- but it had a manual transmission. Luckily, Waterhouse had driven a tractor before, giving her some familiarity with stick-shift driving. She wrestled the car into second gear and managed to drive them home. Now a mother of three girls, Waterhouse and her husband have already taught two of their daughters to ""drive stick."" ""You never know when you're going to need the skill,"" she said. The ability to drive a car with a manual transmission has long been considered an essential skill, especially for young drivers. Yet decades after Waterhouse's impromptu introduction to stick shifts, changes in the makeup of the automobile and American consumer habits mean mastering the manual may no longer be a practical necessity. Downshifting: Thinning of manual herd . In the earliest days of the automobile industry, cars came with only one type of transmission: the manual. After General Motors released the first automatic transmission -- the 1940 Oldsmobile Hydra-Matic -- automobile manufacturers swiftly moved away from manuals. By 1957, 82.7% of American-made cars were equipped with automatic transmissions, according to ""Ward's 1958 Automotive Yearbook."" Though manuals have accounted for about 4% of American car sales in recent years, experts were surprised to see the percentage jump almost 3% in the first quarter of 2012, according to a report by Edmunds.com. The percentages may seem small, but with nearly 12.8 million cars sold in the U.S. last year, those sales add up to more than a half million manuals. Some manufacturers have inferred that the 6.98% ""take rate,"" or percentage of total cars bought, signifies a manual comeback in the consumer market. Despite earlier worry about appealing to millennials, Cristi Landry, Chevrolet's small car marketing manager, said General Motors believes there's a future for manuals in the U.S. consumer market. The company has gone so far as to create mechanisms meant to make manuals more appealing to drive, like the rollback-ready Hill Start Assist feature. Upshifting: comeback or blip? Chris Terry, a product communications representative for Ford Motors, said that while he's not so sure manuals are making a comeback with average consumers, he believes some people will always want them. ""Most people are just interested in getting from A to B,"" Terry said. People who purchase manuals, Terry said, either love the act of driving or are enticed by manuals' historically lower price tag. (Some small cars like the Chevrolet Sonic, however, are more expensive as manuals.) ""Manual transmissions are considered common novelty. In the rest of the world, it just isn't so,"" Terry said. If automatics become cheaper in other countries, this may change, he said. Despite the uptick in manual take rates, not everyone is convinced manuals are making a comeback. ""The U.S. market has been moving away from manuals over the past couple of decades,"" said Steve Yaeger, Nissan's technology and motorsports communications manager. ""We do not see a change in that trend in the foreseeable future."" Nissan, which only offered manual transmissions in 10 of its 19 models in 2011, had an overall manual take rate of 2.1% last year. Just over half of manual sales came from two cars -- the Z Coupe and the Frontier pickup truck. ""It might look like there's a stick-shift revival under way in 2012, but we're not so sure,"" Edmunds.com Features Editor Carroll Lachnit said. ""Fewer manual transmission cars on the road will mean, eventually, that there will be fewer parents or friends who know how to drive them, and so fewer teachers for the next generation."" Pumping the brakes on hype . Manuals, when driven correctly, have traditionally been more fuel efficient than other transmission types, but new transmissions and improvements to automatics have rendered this moot in some models. The automatic Ford Focus gets slightly better gas mileage than its manual counterpart; moreover, new options like continuously variable, dual-clutch and semi-automatic transmissions with paddle shifters, while expensive, can make up for their price tag with fuel efficiency. ""Almost all the high-mpg cars you see advertised on TV, whether they're hybrids or a Chevy Cruze, get their best mileage with one of these other types of transmissions,"" Cars.com Managing Editor David Thomas said. It's important to remember that gas prices, while high, have been high for the past few years -- and manual take rates haven't skyrocketed in that period of time. Where are manuals' advantages? For some consumers with children, technological advancements in other transmissions are outshined by perceived experiential benefits of the manual. Margaret Menotti, an account manager in Boston, is wary of teaching new drivers in automatic cars. ""We made both of our children learn to drive on a stick,"" Menotti said. ""And it's still the only thing they drive."" Menotti said the prevalence of manuals overseas was a major factor in her decision. ""It takes time and practice, but it's worth it,"" said Christina Menotti, Margaret's daughter. ""Once it clicks you don't even think about it."" Many parents also falsely believe that having their children drive manuals will keep them safer because it's more difficult to text or talk on the phone while driving. But neither is impossible, and you can't control other drivers on the road. Multiple federal and state transportation agencies stated accident logs do not differentiate between transmission types. Lessons from the brains of driving instructors . While there remain parents who want their kids to drive stick, most driving schools consider such requests anomalous, Lachnit of Edmunds.com said. ""Chances are at some point they are going to be exposed to a car with a standard manual transmission,"" added Robert Lindsay of The Driver Training Group, a driving school based in Washington state. ""Depending on where the teen lives and the types of cars they are allotted to drive, it is relevant and necessary for some and not others. Our teens tell us unless there is a direct need, they can learn later in life."" Lindsay said no more than 15% of his school's students come from families owning manuals and that fewer students actually drive them. Overall, the school gets only about two or three manual training requests a month. ""I think the old school thought is, 'I learned on a stick back in the day, so my kid should,'"" Lindsay said, ""but that doesn't mean it's right. Those that are into cars are much more likely to want to learn."" His school starts all of its students in cars with automatic transmissions if they do not request otherwise, and does not keep a manual car in its fleet, he said. Ken Stout, president of DriveTeam Inc. in Independence, Ohio, recently purchased a six-speed manual Mini Cooper for his fleet after finding out some students wanted to learn to drive it. ""I don't know how many of (the students) just want to drive a Mini Cooper and how many of them actually want to learn to drive manual as a life skill, though,"" Stout said. Drive Team's manual student population has held steady at 15% for the last five years, and parents usually are the ones who ask for their children to learn manual rather than the children themselves, Stout said. Still, Lindsay and Stout concur with those who think learning manuals can make a student a better driver than those who simply drive automatics. Stout added that the desire has to be there. ""It's wonderful for them to learn it,"" Stout said, ""but you have to want that. You have to want to play golf to go take a golf lesson."" He's not so sure that matters to all parents, as some seem disinclined to make their children the independent drivers they should be. ""I've got parents asking me why we teach their kids to parallel park when the car does it for you,"" he said. Do you teach your kids how to drive a stick shift or do you think it's unnecessary? Let us know in the comments below.","Long considered an essential skill in America, driving stick might be endangered .

"(CNN) -- Last month's assault and massacre at the In-Amenas gas plant in Algeria by an al Qaeda battalion led by Moktar Belmoktar put into sharp focus the growing threat of Islamist jihadists in north and west Africa. It also brought back vivid memories of my own 130-day kidnap ordeal also at the hands of Belmoktar's al Qaeda group in Niger and Mali in 2008/09. Here is an extract from my book... A Season in Hell . TORTURE . With some ceremony, a DVD was produced and inserted into the laptop drive and we were maneuvered around to have pride of place in front of the screen. The others pressed around, the younger ones in front. There were three or four pre-pubescent boys among them, their faces rapt with anticipation as their screen-lit faces excitedly tried to watch us and the laptop simultaneously. 'Mr. Marlboro': The veteran jihadist behind the attack in Algeria . Soon we heard a loud pulsing, urgent, musical beat and the screen was filled with a black flag, the lower half of which was covered with white Arabic script and in the upper portion, there was a globe surmounted by an AK-47 assault rifle; the Al Qaeda banner. Using the traditional and mandatory Islamic opening, a voice intoned in Arabic, ""In the name of Allah the most merciful..."" and the centre of the screen began to fill with images and vignettes of all kinds of horrors: those aircraft slamming into the twin towers. US and allied vehicles being destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan by IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices); video cameras slaved to the sights of Dragunov sniper rifles blasting the heads off GIs and then murdering those who came to their assistance; suicide bombers driving explosive-laden trucks through fences and into buildings or crowds immediately followed by massive explosions. Sometimes such scenes would carry sub-titles giving the date and location of the horror. In other instances, there would be clips of the happy, excited suicide bomber explaining his joy at the prospect of martyring himself for such a noble purpose. Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . There would also be clips of their ""Great Emir"", Bin Laden, uttering in his quiet and reasonable sounding voice his latest threats to tear the heart out of the degenerate West. Then some stocky, heavily bearded, white robed and turbaned American, who we were told was Adam Gadahn, a Jewish Californian convert to Islam and Al Qaeda, made his first of many appearances. Gadahn was ridiculing -- in English, with Arabic sub-titles -- the American President and issuing dire warnings aimed at US audiences of the disasters that would befall America if the USA and her allies did not quit ""Muslim lands"". Read more: Algeria crisis is a wakeup call for America . While Bin Laden was lionized by the young men around us, the star of each show was the brash, in-our-face (and happily defunct) Abou Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian who was the former leader of the Iraqi franchise of Al Qaeda. Zarqawi had walked their talk regarding cleansing ""Muslim lands"" of the presence of infidels with passion, utter ruthlessness and without compromise. He was their man of action. He did, in their view, what others merely talked and fantasized about. The scene the young ones loved best on what we came to call ""TV Night"", was Zarqawi standing, legs planted wide, with a fierce and vicious open-mouthed grin on his face, firing the entire 100 round magazine of a SAW (a Belgian light machinegun), just past the camera with the sound jacked way up. We could almost hear his scream of whatever the Arabic equivalent is of ""GET SOME!"" Read more: Algeria hostage crisis may be future of terrorism . Each time an episode of mayhem and destruction would occur on the screen, the crowd pressing around Louis and me would shout, ""Allahu Akbar"" and immediately swivel their eyes to watch how we were enjoying the show. Without my glasses, I could read none of the signs or sub-titles, so Louis would read them out loud until I quietly asked him to stop. The video did not need a great deal of interpretation. Obviously, these propaganda videos were intended to pump up the boys, to remind them that they were part of a large global cause in which sacrifice was a major element. And it was having the desired impact; particularly for the younger mujahideen whose eyes glistened with excitement as they watched the Western infidels being butchered and humiliated over and over again. The senior members of the Group were less caught up in the show and the laptop operator was choosing the clips to be displayed with some care. I could only imagine what he was skipping and I did not for a moment presume that they were being avoided out of generosity but rather cold, hard pragmatism. They did not want to break their hostages, at least, not yet. In many ways, both for the assembled Belmokhtar Group of AQIM, and for me, the scenes that elicited the strongest emotion were the all-too-familiar images of black-hooded, orange-clad figures, chained hand and foot, shuffling around those tiny cages in Guantanamo. These were indignities perpetrated by my side -- the 'good guys'. Those scenes of German Shepherds, fangs bared, straining to get at broken men cowering in corners and those piles of horrified naked bodies forced into obscene intimacy and, always, the iconic black-hooded figure, mutely perched barefoot on a box in a short black poncho with wires dangling from his outstretched fingers in the disgraceful Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, made me, in the midst of my own mental anguish, feel deep shame. The leaden and menacing stares of our Al Qaeda captors eloquently made a mockery of our aggressive Western claims to harbour higher or superior values. The look on their faces declared that we had abandoned any alleged moral high-ground, which they, at least for the moment, sought to occupy with regard to their treatment of Louis and me, if only to demonstrate to themselves their own moral superiority. It is therefore at least paradoxical that those wretched videotapes and photos of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib may have resulted in Louis' and my captivity being less violent than it otherwise might have been, for it seemed to me that we were spared worse treatment because our abductors were anxious to demonstrate that they didn't stoop to such stuff, which, of course, we know is not generally the case. That particular myth, however, with that particular Group of AQIM hostage-takers, probably served us well. Thus, I found that the most appalling of those TV Night videos images were not the mass murders and individual assassinations perpetrated by Al Qaeda and their allies against our soldiers and civilians, which were never easy to behold, but less difficult to understand. That was simply Al Qaeda being Al Qaeda. That was what they were. Rather, it was the intimate and almost palpable proof of our side's methodically applied, officially sanctioned, and so casually administered barbarity, that had been parsed into the bureaucratic banalities and legal niceties of officially sanctioned abuse and torture which was so hard to absorb. Viewing such scenes, I could not help but believe that if we were capable of such outrages and so carelessly willing to resort to torture-as-entertainment, then we had indeed strayed into truly dangerous ethical territory. The ease with which faux-legal language was coined in Washington and unopposed throughout the West in a cursory attempt to legitimize the illegitimate; the arbitrary manner in which long-standing international conventions were set aside; and the glibness with which word-games and were employed to condone such practices, should have stunned us all. The methodical development of ""black sites"" and concepts like ""extraordinary rendition"" (sub-contracting torture) and ""enhanced interrogation""; the invention of ersatz juridical explanations of why was not torture, and other such despicable behaviour, indeed made a mockery of our Western pretensions to be champions of human rights and international justice. Further, without a shred of doubt, they have massively increased recruitment to the Islamist cause and markedly amplified the threat against Western interests and the security of individual Americans and their friends and allies. If the dreadful events of 11 September 2001 could so easily dismantle the bulwarks of free, just and open societies which had taken us centuries to build, then, yes, our claims to a higher moral standard were in fact a sham, and surely there were no effective limits to what we were prepared to visit upon our enemies, or merely anybody who got in our way. No, these were not made-in-Canada practices, justifications and facilities, but how easily we in our country and our friends throughout Europe abandoned our much-vaunted principles and meekly, often enthusiastically, went along. The bulk of our usually vocal human rights advocates and politicians were muted or stunned into silence when the need to avenge the insult and atrocity of 9/11 was allowed to pervert the law and sully the reputation of our friends and neighbours; perversions which have done and continue to do the West incalculable harm throughout the world. We are clearly guilty by such association. And Louis and I were reaping the consequences. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert R. Fowler.","Massacre in Algeria put into focus the threat of Islamist jihadists in Africa .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has evacuated all 79 crew members from a minesweeper that ran aground Thursday on a reef in the Philippines, the Navy's Seventh Fleet said in a statement Friday. The 224-foot-long,1,312-ton ship was on its way from Subic Bay to its next port call when it struck the Tubbataha Reef, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east-southeast of Palawan Island in the Sulu Sea, the Navy said. Initial efforts to free the Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship at high tide were unsuccessful, and the crew was transferred by small boats to the USNS Bowditch and the MSV C-Champion, ships of the Military Sealift Command, according to the Navy statement. ""Seventh Fleet ships remain on scene and essential Guardian sailors will continue conducting survey operations onboard the ship as needed until she is recovered,"" Vice Adm. Scott Swift, U.S. Seventh Fleet commander, said in a statement. ""Several support vessels have arrived and all steps are being taken to minimize environmental effects while ensuring the crew's continued safety."" Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to threatened and endangered marine species, including fish, corals and sharks. ""The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100-meter perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands,"" according to the UNESCO website. The cause of the grounding was under investigation, the Navy said.

"(CNN) -- ""Married ... with Children"" may have ended in 1997, but that doesn't mean we've seen the last of the Bundys. As originally reported by E!, there's a chance that the comedy could return to TV in a new form. Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind the original series, is said to be shopping a pitch for a spinoff series centered on David Faustino's girl-crazy Bud Bundy. There's no word yet on the plot of the pitch, or if it will be greenlit by the studio. One popular theory is that the show could follow a grown-up Bud as he deals with a family of his own. It also isn't known if any other characters from the original series would be part of the spinoff, or if any of the original cast members are attached. Faustino, at least, doesn't seem opposed to the idea. When he shared news of the pitch on Facebook Thursday, he added in the caption, ""Would be nice, wouldn't it?"" ""Married ... with Children"" premiered in 1987 and went on to have 11 seasons, becoming the first prime-time series to air on Fox and one of the network's first breakout hits. At 259 episodes, it remains the longest running live-action sitcom on the network. The show's stars have mostly gone on to major projects since the series aired its finale in 1997. Ed O'Neill is one of the stars of the Emmy-winning ""Modern Family,"" which begins its sixth season September 24. Katey Sagal has gone on to lead roles in TV hits such as ""Futurama"" and ""8 Simple Rules,"" and currently stars in the FX drama ""Sons Of Anarchy,"" which kicked off its seventh and final season earlier this month, to record ratings. Christina Applegate has taken prominent parts in comedies such as ""Up All Night"" and ""Samantha Who?"" as well as scene-stealing performances in the two ""Anchorman"" films. The entire cast recently reunited for Sagal's Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony. ""Married ... with Children"" is just the latest '90s series that could have a revival. ""Girl Meets World,"" the ""Boy Meets World"" spinoff, has been a success for the Disney Channel and recently got picked up for a second season. And last month, TV Guide reported that a ""Full House"" reboot is in the works with some of the original actors reprising their roles. Reps for Sony Pictures Television would not comment on the reports.","Reports indicate that there's a spinoff pitch for ""Married ... with Children""

"(CNN) -- Had enough of Ebola news coverage? Wait until you see the TV series. According to The Hollywood Reporter, director Ridley Scott and producer Lynda Obst are getting behind a limited TV series based on Richard Preston's 1994 best-seller, ""The Hot Zone."" The two have actually had the property for years and have been developing its latest iteration for several months. With the disease back in the news -- with fear of an epidemic just as timely -- the topicality of the subject is all-too-perfect for a series, Obst told the publication. ""I think it's the speed with which it kills that makes the disease so frightening,"" she said. ""People hoped it would stay in some remote part of the world. But that's a fantasy in the modern world. The modern world makes us one big connected family."" Steven Soderbergh's 2011 film ""Contagion"" addressed similar issues. That movie's screenwriter, Scott Z. Burns, told The Wrap that his main concern is less with the disease itself than with the fear and fear-mongering. ""What scares me more than Ebola are the more mundane viruses of stupidity and fear and partisan politics,"" Burns said. Deadly diseases: Epidemics throughout history . The Ebola outbreak, which started in March, has killed almost 4,500 people in West Africa, and the World Health Organization estimates there could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year. However, WHO announced the end of the Ebola outbreak in Senegal on Friday and hopes to do the same with Nigeria on Monday. In the meantime, a handful of cases have emerged in the United States, fanning concern and leading to the appointment of an ""Ebola czar."" Texas worker quarantined on cruise ship . Scott may direct the first episode of the series, says The Hollywood Reporter. Author Preston, who wrote the basis for ""The Hot Zone"" for The New Yorker in 1992, has another story coming out in the magazine about Ebola soon. Obst, who is one of the producers of Christopher Nolan's forthcoming ""Interstellar,"" has high hopes for the project. ""A limited series is a great way to do this because you don't have to limit it to a three-act structure like you do with a film,"" she said.","Ridley Scott, Lynda Obst doing an Ebola-themed TV series .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Azerbaijan was awarded the open seat on the U.N. Security Council Monday after Slovenia dropped its bid. Four countries, including Pakistan, were elected last week to join the Security Council in January as non-permanent members for two-year terms. Also elected, via secret ballot, were Guatemala, Morocco and Togo. They join the Security Council's five permanent members -- China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States -- plus five countries elected to two-year, non-permanent membership last year -- Colombia, Germany, India, Portugal and South Africa. Azerbaijan and Slovenia were locked in a contest for the fifth seat this year. Azerbaijan was the clear front-runner and after 16 rounds of voting, Slovenia decided to pull out. Voting was conducted in the U.N. General Assembly. Countries are voted onto the Security Council by all 193 U.N. member nations. ""Our campaign was always for Slovenia, for the values that we represent. We were never campaigning against any other candidate,"" said Samuel Zbogar, Slovenia's foreign minister, by way of announcing his country's decision to withdraw. ""We don't approve (of) the way this campaign was held and we don't approve (of) the way these elections were held. However, the current result speaks for itself,"" he said. When contacted by CNN later to elaborate on the county's objections, the Slovenian Mission to the United Nations declined to elaborate. Representatives from various countries lined up to extend their sympathies to the losing candidate. Slovenia entered the race for a Security Council seat some 11 years ago. Starting in January, the council will have as members seven of the nine nations known to have nuclear weapons: China, France, India, Pakistan, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. Absent will be Israel and North Korea. Guatemala will serve on the council for the first time after a failed 2006 bid. That race, against Venezuela, lasted three weeks and 48 rounds of voting, the third-longest in U.N. history. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice released a statement late Monday, congratulating the new non-permanent members of the Security Council. ""In the coming year, the Security Council will address many pressing global challenges, including nuclear non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, conflict prevention and resolution, promotion of democracy and human rights, and the oversight of complex UN field operations, and the United States looks forward to strong partnership with the incoming members,"" it read. Leaving the council will be Brazil, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Gabon, Lebanon and Nigeria. CNN's Richard Roth, Joe Vaccarello and Mick B.

"(CNN) -- That galaxy far, far away is apparently bigger than first thought. The ""Star Wars"" franchise will get two spinoff movies, Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger announced Tuesday. ""We are in development of a few standalone films that are not part of the 'Star Wars' saga,"" he said. ""There are now creative entities working on developing scripts for what would be those standalone films."" The two films, if they make it out of development, will be released after Episode VII, which Iger said is on target for summer 2015. Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg each will write one of the new films and consult on the next three ""Star Wars"" sequels. ""Each standalone film will focus on a specific character,"" Lucasfilm said on its starwars.com site. Lucasfilm will disclose more details about the spinoff in the future, Iger said. Kasdan wrote the screenplays for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" He also penned the script for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Kinberg has written eight screenplays, according to the Internet Movie Database. His works include ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" and ""Sherlock Holmes."" He also did the screenplay for the next installment in the ""X-Men"" films, according to IMDB.com. The announcement comes three months after Disney bought Lucasfilm for $4 billion and just days after it revealed that J.J. Abrams has been signed to direct the next ""Star Wars"" episode.

"(CNN) -- European leaders are meeting in Brussels Thursday to discuss further sanctions against Russia. So far the EU has imposed financial and visa restrictions against 21 carefully selected Russian and Ukrainian officials -- but avoided anyone from President Vladimir Putin's inner circle and stayed clear of any large-scale economic sanctions. The EU and U.S. have condemned Russian annexation of Crimea as illegal and stepped up their rhetoric towards the Kremlin, but whether they are willing to put more economic pressure on Russia is unclear. The leaders of Europe's biggest economies are likely to be cautious. Here's why. How important is Russia's economy? Russia is the eight biggest economy in the world, with GDP of more than $2 trillion. But its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities, particularly oil and gas, was growing just 1.3% last year compared to 2012, one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets. With the Ukraine crisis taking its toll, Russia's economy may not grow at all in 2014, some analysts have warned. Hopes Russia would be one of the decade's powerhouse economies may have faded, but its close links with the European Union have not. Would sanctions hit Europe back? The EU is Russia's largest trading partner, and there are deep economic links between the two. Almost half of Russia's exports -- $292 billion worth -- end up in EU countries. 15% of Russia's GDP comes directly from the country's exports to EU. Russia, in turn, is the third biggest trading partner for the EU, with $169 billion in imports. But the eurozone itself has only just emerged from its own crisis, and is wary of cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner. Its reliance on gas out of Russia would also feed caution. Robert Pape, political science professor at University of Chicago with expertise in security studies, says the sanctions would hurt both sides. ""Between great powers, leverage is a two-way street, Russia can squeeze us almost as effectively as we can squeeze them,"" Pape wrote for CNN. While steps that would push the price of oil down for a sustained period would really bite, these would be hitting right back. Energy supplies remain vitally important for the European Union, to which Russia supplies a third of EU's natural gas. Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia. What is Russia's economic relationship with the U.S? The economic relationship between Russia and the U.S. is more unbalanced. Russia is the 20th largest trading partner for the U.S., with $27 billion worth of trade exported across the Atlantic. On the flip-side, the U.S. is Russia's fifth largest partner, with just $11 billion worth of trade. According to Russian Foundation chair David Clark, trade is a ""relatively unimportant"" component of relations. Energy links are also weakening as the U.S. looks to shale gas for its energy supplies and heads towards self-sufficiency. Clark told CNN the U.S. could get greater leverage over Russia from financial sanctions aimed at the country's banking system and stability of the ruble. Measures targeted at named individuals, similar to those contained in the Magnitsky Act, could also be effective. ""Russia's angry response to the act shows that it works,"" Clark said. But again, the financial links between Russia and the west would mean huge losses for European banks which have lent billions to Russia. While the EU and U.S. adopted sanctions against 28 individuals, Clark said these ""have little more than nuisance value and would have to be dramatically expanded to have a real impact."" ""Travel bans and asset freezes aimed at all members of the Duma and Federation Council who voted to annex Crimea would be a start,"" Clark said. Targeting the money men who handle the finances and assets (often illicit) of top tier politicians would really hurt, he added. And the names of these individuals are quite well known. But again, the financial links between Russia and the west would mean huge losses for European banks which have lent billions to Russia. Are there other options? The EU has a wide range of legal options here. Its economic significance means sanctions can be very powerful tool. Export and import bans or restrictions that apply to specific products such as oil or diamonds, flights restrictions or investment freezes have been successful in the past. ""Restricting access to foreign capital and the international banking system could prove very damaging indeed because Russia's economy is stagnating and it needs inward investment,"" Clark said. But experience shows that economic sanctions rarely work in the pursuit of non-economic goals. ""Imposing economic sanctions on a state is similar to backing an angry dog into a corner -- in most cases, the dog will become more vicious, and more defensive,"" Pape said. At the end, targeting Russia's national pride may prove more useful. ""A decision by a large group of countries to boycott the 2018 Football World Cup in Russia would probably hurt Russian prestige rather more, especially if FIFA had to move the event to another country,"" David Clark said.

"(CNN) -- It used to be one of the great sights in tennis -- the likes of Boris Becker and John McEnroe flying around the net, executing flawless volleys to follow up precision serves. But the fearsome hitting power of modern tennis players has destroyed an art once finessed by some of Wimbledon's greatest champions, according to eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl. Czech legend Lendl believes the bold playing style -- mastered to thrilling effect on grass by legends such as Rod Laver, Stefan Edberg, Martina Navratilova and Pat Rafter -- has been outdated by advances in technology and training. ""The reason the guys don't serve and volley is mainly because of the spin on the ball that is given by the string and also by the strength of the guys and their technique,"" Lendl told CNN. ""So to come to the net and be fishing for that ball when the guy takes a full swing and it has 8,000 rpm on that ball ... it becomes very, very difficult to volley and put away."" In the next two weeks, Lendl is chasing the Wimbledon title -- the only grand slam that eluded him as a player -- as a coach for British number one Andy Murray. But Lendl, who is now a U.S. citizen, appears unlikely to encourage the Scot to make frequent forays from the baseline. Murray relishes Wimbledon's home comforts . ""There are only a handful of guys that can do it right now -- Roger (Federer) being one of them,"" Lendl said. But even Federer, whose serve-and-volley prowess helped secure six Wimbledon titles, has abandoned the technique. Tim Henman, a four-time Wimbledon semifinalist and one of the few players of his generation to embrace the serve-and-volley game, thinks Federer has been forced to adapt his style at the London venue. ""He used to (serve and volley), but I think the conditions of the grass have changed so much -- the balls are probably heavier, the courts are much, much slower, so there is far less serve and volley,"" Henman told CNN. However, the former British number one maintains that coming to the net can pay off at Wimbledon, adding: ""I think you've got to really keep attacking on grass, it's the hardest surface to defend on."" Lost art . Yet Pete Sampras, the most lethal exponent of serve and volley ever seen at the All England Club, is less optimistic about the future of the technique. ""It's gone,"" he told CNN earlier this year. ""I love watching Roger, Nadal, Djokovic, but it's sad to see Wimbledon today with everyone staying back,"" Sampras said in March. ""I developed the serve and volley game at a young age. I started at 13, 14 -- if you're 20 and don't serve and volley, it's too late."" Sampras concurs with Lendl that the state-of-the-art equipment used by today's players has hastened the decline of serve-volley. ""Technology might be an issue because with these big Babolat rackets, they don't need to volley, you just hit the crap out of the ball. Whereas we grew up with the wood racket, so you had to hit it properly,"" said the seven-time Wimbledon champion. ""It'd be nice to have someone come up that serves and volleys. It's definitely a lost art, and it's unfortunate."" Sampras would not be the only one saddened if the era of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic -- so often hailed as a golden one for tennis -- also came to be defined by the erosion of one the game's most exhilarating skills.","Former world No. 1 Ivan Lendl says serve and volley is too difficult in modern tennis .

"(CNN) -- Malawi's high court ruled in favor of pop superstar Madonna on Friday, saying she will be able to adopt a young girl from the country, said Zione Ntaba, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office. Madonna walks with her Malawian son, David Banda, in Lilongwe, Malawi, in March. ""In our judgment,"" the court wrote in its ruling, ""the welfare of infant CJ will be better taken care of by having her adopted by the foreign parent rather than for her to grow up in an orphanage where she will have no family life, no love and affection of parents."" Madonna issued a statement saying she is ""extremely grateful for the Supreme Court's ruling on my application to adopt Mercy James. I am ecstatic. ... My family and I look forward to sharing our lives with her."" The young girl at the center of the current case is Chifundo James, whose first name translates to ""mercy"" in Chichewa, Malawi's national language. Madonna, 50, took her effort to adopt the three-year-old to Malawi's highest court last month after a lower court ruled the adoption did not meet local law. Malawi requires applicants for adoption to have lived in the country for 18 months before they may be granted permission. That condition was waived in 2006, when Madonna adopted another Malawian child, David Banda. Madonna has two other children who are not adopted. Mercy has lived in an orphanage for most of her life; her teenage mother died shortly after childbirth. Meanwhile, child rights group Eye of the Child told CNN it agrees with Friday's high court ruling. The group had earlier opposed the adoption. ""There was legal confusion about this case,"" said Maxwell Matewere, executive director of Eye of the Child. ""We are happy that the high court is able now to give us direction. This provides an important precedent."" But the man believed to be the father of Chifundo told CBS's ""The Early Show"" that he did not want Madonna to adopt the young girl. ""I'm crying. I need my baby,"" James Kambewa said. ""I don't know where I can find any help."" Kambewa told CBS that he wants to raise the child. ""I do not want my baby to be adopted because I want to take care of her and I'm capable to take care of my baby. ... Mercy, she is a Malawian -- so (I) need her to grow as a Malawian, as well with our culture."" The court said it does not know who the girl's father is. Madonna's long-term charitable involvement in the country was considered when the court decided in her favor, according to the judgment. Madonna has been involved with Malawi for several years and made a documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" to highlight the poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating children in the country. She also co-founded a nonprofit group, Raising Malawi, that provides programs to help the needy. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this story.","50-year-old singer had filed a petition to adopt Chifundo James .

"(CNN) -- As the crisis in Syria intensifies and Bashar al-Assad's hold on power starts to unravel, concerns are mounting over what may come next for the beleaguered nation. Some foresee bloody sectarian strife or a descent into militia rule, while others fear what might become of its chemical weapons stockpile. Not all observers agree it's the beginning of the endgame for al-Assad, but all are sure there's no clear road map for what lies ahead. The prospects for al-Assad are ""very grim,"" said Shashank Joshi, an associate fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute think tank and a doctoral student at Harvard University. Syria's chemical weapons threat demands a response . ""There's no going back,"" he said. ""He's not far from collapse, because what's occurred through defection or assassination is that the political part of his regime has been hollowed out."" By contrast Dr. Dan Plesch, director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, considers it too soon to write al-Assad out of the picture. But in a scenario where he is pushed out -- bringing to an end four decades of rule by him and his father before him -- the Syrian military will likely play a major role in what happens next, Plesch said. Recent defections of high-level officers -- notably regime insider Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlas -- on top of the desertion of many rank and file personnel, signal an erosion of the army's coherence in the face of the rebellion. Many of those at the top are determined to fight on to the end because they fear the personal consequences for them if they lose, analysts say. In what some saw as a turning point after more than 16 months of violence, al-Assad lost four top aides following an explosion in Damascus last week, as rebel forces attacked the capital and Syria's commercial hub, Aleppo. Reinforcements head to Aleppo . So far, al-Assad has shown no signs of quitting. But what's not yet clear is how much stomach he has for a continued bloody conflict, and whether he might be more inclined to negotiate a transition than some of his immediate entourage, Plesch said. If al-Assad's ouster were the result of a ""palace coup,"" involving negotiation between some insiders and the insurgency, slightly more continuity would ensue, said Joshi. However, such a transition is likely to be unstable because many rebels would refuse to accept it and would fight on. He believes it more likely that the regime collapses entirely and the Syrian National Council -- an opposition coalition whose leadership resides outside of Syria -- stakes a claim to lead the transition as part of a coalition also involving opposition figures within Syria and Kurdish and liberal representatives. However, unlike Libya, where the National Transitional Council presented a fairly unified voice as Gadhafi's regime crumbled, the opposition in Syria remains more fragmented and no credible transitional leader has yet come to the fore, Joshi said. Plesch agrees that while the Syrian National Council ""aspires to be the linchpin in the transition,"" questions remain over how effective it could be and what support it commands among rebels on the ground. Ausama Monajed, who advised a previous president of the Syrian National Council, told CNN in March that his group has a plan for a post-Assad era, including the formation of a transitional unity government and a body to draw up a new constitution and election laws, leading eventually to parliamentary and presidential elections. At the time, observers responded with skepticism. ""There's a lack of coordination amongst the insiders, and they represent the outsiders, not the insiders,"" said former U.S. ambassador to Syria Edward Djerejian. ""It's not a coherent opposition leadership."" What we need to know about Syria . Another scenario sees Syria descend into a chaotic and bloody sectarian conflict, pitting Syria's majority Sunni Muslims against the ruling Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, and embroiling its Christian, Druze and other minority groups too. Such a conflict risks destabilizing the wider region. The recent defection of two key Sunni figures, Tlas and Syria's ambassador to Iraq, Nawaf Fares, means all al-Assad has left is a narrow Alawite bloc with shrinking public support, Joshi said. If the regime collapses, the Alawites could retreat to strongholds in the northwest of the country around Latakia and attempt to reconstitute a state there, he said. Syria's Kurds could also seek greater autonomy, a move which would worry Turkey, which has a troubled relationship with its own Kurdish population. However, Rime Allaf, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank, argues against making too much of Syria's sectarian tensions. The regime ""has been using the sectarian line, but the opposition and the rebels have increasingly repeated that they do not view it in those terms,"" she said. ""So it's not the Alawites who are crumbling, it's a regime. ... It means many people within that regime, whatever religious denomination they are, they don't necessarily agree with the way things are happening."" Sectarianism aside, the large number of militia groups that have taken up arms across Syria will present a ""significant challenge"" to the country's future stability whoever ends up in power, Joshi said. They range from the pro-government Shabiha militia groups, blamed by opposition activists for many of the more brutal attacks on civilians, to rebel hardline Islamist groups and local networks that have formed to protect their villages. At the same time, the rebel Free Syrian Army, largely composed of soldiers who defected from the al-Assad regime, is more a loose organization of armed groups than a coherent military body, said Joshi. Faces of the Free Syrian Army . He predicts that whatever Syrian government results from the conflict will not be in charge of its whole territory, a problem made worse by the porous nature of the country's borders. If the Syrian National Council ultimately does take charge, it may struggle to contain the worst excesses of the militia groups, he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said this month that it considers the conflict a ""non-international armed conflict"" -- or a civil war -- but some analysts say international forces are in fact involved. Opposition forces are being ""quite well-armed and probably trained by external clandestine forces from the Gulf states and probably from Turkey,"" Plesch said. Questions should also be asked about some European and North American involvement, he added. At the same time, Syria's neighbors, which include Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, all have a stake in how the conflict plays out and exert varying degrees of influence within Syria. Part of the international community's unease stems from Syria's position as a regional powerhouse. ""Syria really is the epicenter of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the international community's confrontation with Iran,"" said Plesch. Another concern to those watching from the wings is Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons. Syria's foreign ministry said Monday that the country has chemical weapons that it would be willing to use against foreign attackers, although it sought to roll back the message Tuesday. Its remarks led to strong warnings from U.S. officials, including President Barack Obama, who said such a move would be a ""tragic mistake."" Obama administration officials are now holding regular high-level meetings to discuss the ongoing situation in Syria and begin thinking about U.S. priorities in a post-Assad era, a senior U.S. official told CNN Monday. The Obama administration has also stepped up its discussions with Israel, Jordan and Turkey about Syria's chemical weapons arsenal . The al-Assad regime ""probably has the largest and most advanced chemical warfare program in the Arab world,"" according to Michael Eisenstadt, senior fellow and director of the military and security studies program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. A Syrian town's 'street of death' But there is good reason to be skeptical that this arsenal would ever be used, Joshi said. Syrian commanders would not want to be held individually responsible with no regime to protect them, he said. Commanders are also well aware that the risk of such weapons getting into the hands of allies such as Hezbollah would likely induce external intervention, particularly from Israel. For some observers, the international community's increasing focus on Syria's weapons stockpile also conjures unwelcome echoes of the run-up to the Iraq war. Syrian allies China and Russia, who last week blocked another United Nations Security Council resolution for new sanctions if Syrian government forces don't stop attacks against civilians, are opposed to the kind of foreign intervention seen in Iraq as well as in Libya last year. Moscow indicated Tuesday that Damascus should refrain from making use of chemical weapons in line with its ratification of Geneva protocols. ""Russia's policy is based on the understanding that Syrian authorities will continue to strictly follow their international obligations,"" the foreign ministry said. As for al-Assad, if he is forced from power, his personal fate will likely depend on whether he remains in Syria, and in whose hands. A new regime might want to prosecute him for alleged war crimes or it might decide it would be more advantageous to allow him to go into exile, said Plesch. Al-Assad's options for exile appear limited, with much of the world outraged by the thousands of civilian deaths resulting from his regime's crackdown on what it calls ""armed terrorists."" Plesch speculates that a country that is ""not quite Russia,"" such as Moldova or South Ossetia, could offer a haven. Alternatively, al-Assad could hang on to power for months yet, if regime forces and the Free Syrian Army continue to battle without a decisive victory on either side and the international community declines to step in. So long as Russia and China continue to block tougher U.N. Security Council action on Syria, foreign intervention seems unlikely. And although U.S. officicals have led calls for an end to the conflict, Plesch suggests that a prolonged conflict in Syria might not be the ""worst option"" from an Israeli or American militarist point of view, because neutralizing Syria would have the effect of isolating Hezbollah, and to a degree Hamas, from Iran, an ally of Damascus. ""If you are a Western security planner who thinks it's highly likely that there has to be a military confrontation with Iran sooner or later, then keeping Syria off the board is probably one of the things that's quite desirable to do,"" he said. Why Syria could get even uglier . CNN's Holly Yan, Barbara Starr and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","It is hard to predict what might follow the ouster of Bashar al-Assad, analysts say .
Syria's warning it could use chemical weapons against foreign attackers prompts alarm .
Some fear Syria may descend into sectarian violence, destabilizing the region .
Syria's military is likely to play a key role in how events pan out ."
"(CNN) -- The Foo Fighters have made the most of their week-long residency on ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" -- and they've even moved the host to the verge of tears. On Wednesday's after-show (which is available online), Letterman told the story of how the Foos' ""Miracle"" provided the soundtrack for one of his most significant moments as a father: learning to ski with his then-4-year-old son, Harry. As Letterman tells it, he was hoping to find a bonding experience as the 60-something father of a young child and decided to try skiing. After several days of skiing, the instructor concluded his lessons by taking a video of the pair coming down a mountain in Montana's Madison Range. Letterman said he forgot about the video until three weeks later, when a package arrived in the mail. ""Lo and behold, it's me and it's Harry coming down this mountain,"" Letterman said, his voice clouding with emotion. ""The video is stunning because the kid couldn't be cuter ... and the music the guy chose to put underneath the ski video is the song you're going to hear now from the Foo Fighters."" After the performance concluded, Letterman added, ""You see what I mean? That's pretty good!"" The Foo Fighters have been dazzling all week long. On Monday, they brought out Zac Brown for a version of Black Sabbath's ""War Pigs."" Tuesday found them collaborating with Heart's Ann and Nancy Wilson on ""Kick It Out."" And on Wednesday's show, singer-songwriter Tony Joe White joined the band for a bluesy version of his biggest hit, ""Polk Salad Annie."" The group and Letterman have a history.

"London (CNN) -- Supporters of King Richard III want a just-revealed reconstruction of the monarch's head to bring a human aspect to a leader portrayed through the centuries as a murderous villain who butchered his way to power. The Richard III Society commissioned the reconstruction -- which was unveiled before media in London Tuesday -- after remains believed to be those of the medieval king were discovered under in a parking lot in Leicester, England. Scientists announced Monday that DNA testing had established that the skeleton was indeed that of Richard III. Read more: Body found under parking lot is Richard III . Since his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Richard III has been portrayed as hunchbacked and hateful, accused of killing his own nephews, the ""Princes in the Tower,"" to usurp the throne. But the Richard III Society believes the monarch has been unfairly maligned by history and in particular the Tudors who ousted him. It says its three-dimensional model of the king shows a face ""far removed from the image of the cold-blooded villain of Shakespeare's play."" Twitter digs Richard III discovery . Society chairman Dr. Phil Stone told reporters in London that the discovery and identification of the monarch had been ""a momentous time"" for the society. He praised screenwriter Philippa Langley's ""tenacity and bloody-mindedness"" in pursuing the project to locate his remains. Langley said her aims had been two-fold -- to try to find Richard III so that his remains could be retrieved from an ""undignified place"" and to ""go in search of the real Richard III."" Read more: Will Richard III discovery rewrite history? Seeing the facial reconstruction, she said, had been the most important moment. ""It was the biggest moment because suddenly the aim of seeing the real Richard III came true. That's a man who is three-dimensional in every sense."" In a statement, she said: ""The experience was breathtaking -- one of the most overwhelming moments of my life. ""I wasn't alone in finding this an approachable, kindly face, almost inviting conversation."" Caroline Wilkinson, Professor of Craniofacial Identification at the University of Dundee led the reconstruction project. In a statement, she said Richard III's facial structure was based on ""anatomical assessment and interpretation, and a 3D replication process known as stereolithography."" ""The final head was pained and textured with glass eyes and a wig, using the portraits as reference, to create a realistic and regal appearance."" Janice Aitken -- from the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design at the University of Dundee -- said CT scans of the monarch's skull had been used to build the reconstruction, 70% of which was within 2mm accuracy.

Stone said in a statement that the face was ""younger and fuller than we have been used to seeing, less careworn and with a hint of a smile."" Richard III seemed ""alive and about to speak,"" he said. ""At last, it seems, we have the true image of Richard III -- is this the face that launched a thousand myths?""

"(CNN) -- On a June day in 2009, a 39-year-old man named Ken Milles lay on an exam table at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. A month earlier, he'd suffered a massive heart attack that destroyed nearly a third of his heart. ""The most difficult part was the uncertainty,"" he recalls. ""Your heart is 30% damaged, and they tell you this could affect you the rest of your life."" He was about to receive an infusion of stem cells, grown from cells taken from his own heart a few weeks earlier. No one had ever tried this before. About three weeks later, in Kentucky, a patient named Mike Jones underwent a similar procedure at the University of Louisville's Jewish Hospital. Jones suffered from advanced heart failure, the result of a heart attack years earlier. Like Milles, he received an infusion of stem cells, grown from his own heart tissue. ""Once you reach this stage of heart disease, you don't get better,"" says Dr. Robert Bolli, who oversaw Jones' procedure, explaining what doctors have always believed and taught. ""You can go down slowly, or go down quickly, but you're going to go down."" Conventional wisdom took a hit Monday, as Bolli's group and a team from Cedars-Sinai each reported that stem cell therapies were able to reverse heart damage, without dangerous side effects, at least in a small group of patients. In Bolli's study, published in The Lancet, 16 patients with severe heart failure received a purified batch of cardiac stem cells. Within a year, their heart function markedly improved. The heart's pumping ability can be quantified through the ""Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction,"" a measure of how much blood the heart pumps with each contraction. A patient with an LVEF of less than 40% is considered to suffer severe heart failure. When the study began, Bolli's patients had an average LVEF of 30.3%. Four months after receiving stem cells, it was 38.5%. Among seven patients who were followed for a full year, it improved to an astounding 42.5%. A control group of seven patients, given nothing but standard maintenance medications, showed no improvement at all. ""We were surprised by the magnitude of improvement,"" says Bolli, who says traditional therapies, such as placing a stent to physically widen the patient's artery, typically make a smaller difference. Prior to treatment, Mike Jones couldn't walk to the restroom without stopping for breath, says Bolli. ""Now he can drive a tractor on his farm, even play basketball with his grandchildren. His life was transformed."" At Cedars-Sinai, 17 patients, including Milles, were given stem cells approximately six weeks after suffering a moderate to major heart attack. All had lost enough tissue to put them ""at big risk"" of future heart failure, according to Dr. Eduardo Marban, the director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, who developed the stem cell procedure used there. Cedars-Sinai: Helping the heart heal itself . The results were striking. Not only did scar tissue retreat -- shrinking 40% in Ken Milles, and between 30% and 47% in other test subjects -- but the patients actually generated new heart tissue. On average, the stem cell recipients grew the equivalent of 600 million new heart cells, according to Marban, who used MRI imaging to measure changes. By way of perspective, a major heart attack might kill off a billion cells. ""This is unprecedented, the first time anyone has grown living heart muscle,"" says Marban. ""No one else has demonstrated that. It's very gratifying, especially when the conventional teaching has been that the damage is irreversible."" Perhaps even more important, no treated patient in either study suffered a significant health setback. The twin findings are a boost to the notion that the heart contains the seeds of its own rebirth. For years, doctors believed that heart cells, once destroyed, were gone forever. But in a series of experiments, researchers including Bolli's collaborator, Dr. Piero Anversa, found that the heart contains a type of stem cell that can develop into either heart muscle or blood vessel components -- in essence, whatever the heart requires at a particular point in time. The problem for patients like Mike Jones or Ken Milles is that there simply aren't enough of these repair cells waiting around. The experimental treatments involve removing stem cells through a biopsy, and making millions of copies in a laboratory. The Bolli/Anversa group and Marban's team both used cardiac stem cells, but Bolli and Anversa ""purified"" the CSCs, so that more than 90% of the infusion was actual stem cells. Marban, on the other hand, used a mixture of stem cells and other types of cells extracted from the patient's heart. ""We've found that the mixture is more potent than any subtype we've been able to isolate,"" he says. He says the additional cells may help by providing a supportive environment for the stem cells to multiply. Other scientists, including Dr. Douglas Losordo, have produced improvements in cardiac patients using stem cells derived from bone marrow. ""The body contains cells that seem to be pre-programmed for repair,"" explains Losordo. ""The consistent thing about all these approaches is that they're leveraging what seems to be the body's own repair mechanism."" Losordo praised the Lancet paper, and recalls the skepticism that met Anversa's initial claims, a decade ago, that there were stem cells in the adult heart. ""Some scientists are always resistant to that type of novelty. You know the saying: First they ignore you, then they attack you and finally they imitate you."" Denis Buxton, who oversees stem cell research at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health, calls the new studies ""a paradigm shift, harnessing the heart's own regenerative processes."" But he says he would like to see more head-to-head comparisons to determine which type of cells are most beneficial. Questions also remain about timing. Patients who suffer large heart attacks are prone to future damage, in part because the weakened heart tries to compensate by dilating -- swelling -- and by changing shape. In a vicious circle, the changes make the heart a less efficient pump, which leads to more overcompensation, and so on, until the end result is heart failure. Marban's study aimed to treat patients before they could develop heart failure in the first place. In a third study released Monday, researchers treated patients with severe heart failure with stem cells derived from bone marrow. In a group of 60 patients, those receiving the treatment had fewer heart problems over the course of a year, as well as improved heart function. A fourth study also used cells derived from bone marrow, but injected them into patients two to three weeks after a heart attack. Previous studies, with the cells given just days afterward, found a modest improvement in heart function. But Monday, the lead researcher, Dr. Dan Simon of UH Case Medical Center, reported that with the three-week delay, patients did not see the same benefit. With other methods, there may be a larger window of opportunity. At least in initial studies, Losordo's bone marrow treatments helped some patients with long-standing heart problems. Bolli's Lancet paper suggests that CSCs, too, might help patients with advanced disease. ""These patients had had heart failure for several years. They were a wreck!"" says Bolli. ""But we found their stem cells were still very competent."" By that, he means the cells were still capable of multiplying and of turning into useful muscle and blood vessel walls. Marban has an open mind on the timing issue. In fact, one patient from his control group e-mailed after the study was complete, saying he felt terrible and pleading for an infusion of stem cells. At Marban's request, the FDA granted special approval to treat him. ""He had a very nice response. That was 14 months after his heart attack. Of course that's just one person, and we need bigger studies,"" says Marban. For Ken Milles, the procedure itself wasn't painful, but it was unsettling. The biopsy to harvest the stem cells felt ""weird,"" he recalls, as he felt the doctor poking around inside his heart. The infusion, a few weeks later, was harder. The procedure -- basically the same as an angioplasty -- involved stopping blood flow through the damaged artery for three minutes, while the stem cells were infused. ""It felt exacfly like I was having a heart attack again,"" Milles remembers. Milles had spent the first weeks after his heart attack just lying in bed re-watching his ""Sopranos"" DVDs, but within a week of the stem cell infusion, he says, ""I was reinvigorated."" Today he's back at work full time, as an accounting manager at a construction company. He's cut out fast food and shed 50 pounds. His wife and two teenage sons are thrilled. Denis Buxton says the new papers could prove a milestone. ""We don't have anything else to actually regenerate the heart. These stem cell therapies have the possibility of actually reversing damage."" Bolli says he'll have to temper his enthusiasm until he can duplicate the results in larger studies, definitive enough to get stem cell therapy approved as a standard treatment. ""If a phase 3 study confirmed this, it would be the biggest advance in cardiology in my lifetime. We would possibly be curing heart failure. It would be a revolution.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Early in the morning on March 23, Zheng Minsheng walked in front of an elementary school in Fujian province. Wielding a knife, he attacked the students who happened to be around, killing eight and wounding several others. Authorities said Zheng, 42, carried out the attack because he was frustrated at ""failures in his romantic life,"" according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Whatever his real motive was, the senseless killing, reported widely by the Chinese media, shocked the nation. Zheng was tried, sentenced to death and executed on April 28. If Chinese authorities thought Zheng's execution would deter similar attacks, they were wrong. The day he was executed, a knife-wielding man attacked elementary school students in southern Guangdong province, wounding 16 students and a teacher. The attacker was later subdued by the police, and no one died. The next day, a man in Jiangsu province barged into a kindergarten and stabbed 31 people, including 28 students, two teachers and one security guard. ""It was too horrible to imagine,"" one eyewitness told local reporters. ""I saw blood everywhere."" Police apprehended the suspect, 47-year-old Xu Yuyuan. Then, on April 30, a man barged into a village school in Shandong province, carrying a hammer and a can of gasoline. Wang Yonglai, a local farmer, attacked preschool students with the hammer, causing head injuries. He then set himself on fire and died. According to a Xinhua report, the local farmer went berserk after the local police told him that the family house he had just built using 110,000 yuan (US$16,110) of family savings had to be torn down because it had been built on farmland, which is illegal in China. It was the third such school attack in three days. The spate of school attacks is prompting public anger. ""What is going on with these people?"" Wen Jia, a father of a pre-schooler in Beijing, asked CNN. ""Why take their frustrations on defenseless children? We need better security in schools, but we also need to take care of the mentally ill."" On Friday, the Ministry of Education on its website issued an urgent circular ordering kindergartens, elementary and secondary schools to beef up security and restrict strangers from entering the campuses. The ministry instructed schools across the country to hire security guards, install security facilities and ensure that pupils are escorted home. Schools are also urged to teach pupils to how to protect themselves. Guns are strictly controlled in China, but until recently possession of large knives were not. Chinese authorities have recently issued a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when they buy knives longer that 15 centimeters. Other measures are being put in place. In Jiangsu province, local police have helped schools set up ""campus security team"" composed of 70 security guards with batons and pepper spray. Police in Beijing have distributed ""forks"", long poles with semi-circular prongs that security guards could use to fight assailants. In Changsha, capital of central Hunan province, parents formed vigilante teams to patrol local elementary schools. This series of school attacks are blamed on people with personal grievances or suffering from mental illness. Says Ding Xueliang, a sociology professor in Hong Kong: ""The Chinese society has generated enormous pressure on individuals and some of those individuals have perhaps had emotional and psychological problems. They want to cause general attention from the population and attacking kids perhaps is the best way from their perspective of achieving this objective."" These recent incidents are covered extensively in the local media and on the Internet, prompting concerns over copycat violence. Says sociologist Ding Xueliang: ""With the mass media (reports), particularly on the Internet, more individuals are likely to copy such practice, if the Chinese government does not do things quickly and effectively."" For the terrified pupils and worried parents, the solutions are not coming quickly enough.","Recent spate of attacks at schools in China has prompted public anger .

"(CNN) -- When the Kansas City Royals moved on to the World Series on Wednesday, superfan Paul Rudd knew exactly what time it was: time to party. The 45-year-old actor was born in New Jersey but grew up in a suburb of Kansas City and is one of the team's true blue supporters. He was in town for the American League Championship Series game on Wednesday night, when the Royals beat the Baltimore Orioles 2-1 to advance to the World Series for the first time since 1985. Rocking a new baseball cap in support of his team, a hoarse and clearly thrilled Rudd told CNN affiliate KMBC that he's had faith the Royals could come this far. ""I know for the last several years, every year, all of us Royals fans we have the same hope. ... When we went on that win streak this summer, it was like, this could legitimately happen,"" he said. ""I've lost my voice, but I've lost my voice at just about every game since the Wild Card. (Tonight's win) was amazing. This entire town feels it."" Lost voice or no, Rudd wasn't ready to call it a night. ""I'm going to be partying at my mom's house!"" he joked. ""Party at my mom's, man. She's out of town; I've got a keg. It's going to be sweet! Five dollar cover!"" Once the celebration dies down, Rudd's going to have to head back to work. He's filming the upcoming Marvel movie ""Ant-Man"" and got permission to leave the set to catch the third and fourth games of the ALCS before making his way back on Thursday. He's hoping he'll get to sneak away for another game when his Royals face the winner of the San Francisco Giants-St. Louis Cardinals series. ""Now I'm going to pray that they can somehow let me go,"" Rudd told the Kansas City Star. ""The higher powers make those decisions. ...

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. At 2 a.m., most workers are asleep in their beds, blissfully unaware that their alarm clocks will sound in a few short hours. But for 41 percent of Americans this is the time of day is when they are most productive, according to a 2005 poll by the National Sleep Foundation. Some people prefer working the night shift. You can probably pick these folks out of your own office -- they're your co-workers who slouch into work, never a minute early but often several late, bleary-eyed and lackadaisical during the earlier part of the workday. Some might call it slacking, but science calls it something else completely. Severe night-owl symptoms, also known as Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, are a condition characterized by extreme difficulty falling asleep before 2 a.m. and trouble waking early, according to the Sleep Disorder Channel. When forced to rise in time for 9-to-5 jobs, they are rarely at their most productive. Rather than struggle by working a traditional schedule, we thought we'd give you night owls another option: finding a career that fashions to your preferred schedules. If you're most productive at night, check out these jobs to fit your schedule. Some of them might surprise you. 1.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, upheld Kentucky's use of lethal injection as a means of executing prisoners, ruling that the method -- used in 35 states -- is properly and humanely applied. The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that Kentucky's use of lethal injection is not ""cruel and unusual."" At issue was whether the most common method of capital punishment can cause excruciating pain for death row inmates, violating the Constitution's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishment"" and thereby giving inmates a proper challenge in court. The justices had never directly addressed the fundamental question over the constitutionality of the chemical ""cocktail"" of drugs used to execute convicted killers. All but one of the states that perform executions use the three-drug mixture. ""Kentucky has adopted a method of execution believed to be the most humane available,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. ""If administered as intended, that procedure will result in a painless death."" The immediate impact of the ruling is that it will allow states to resume executions, which had been on hold since September while the high court considered this appeal. No executions are scheduled in the next few weeks. The ruling gives guidance to other states, some of which may have to modify their procedures to fall in line with Kentucky's method and thereby survive judicial scrutiny. Kentucky inmates Ralph Baze and Clyde Bowling Jr. brought suit in federal court three years ago, questioning that state's three-chemical mixture and the procedures used to administer it. They claim that the first drug, sodium thiopental, which renders the prisoner unconscious, wears off too quickly and that some prisoners are actually awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continues. The second drug, pancuronium bromide, paralyzes all muscle movement and then prevents the condemned person from speaking and expressing awareness of pain, according to the suit, and the third drug, potassium chloride, which induces cardiac arrest, is ""excruciatingly painful in a conscious person."" ""We ... agree that petitioners have not carried their burden of showing that the risk of pain from maladministration of a concededly humane lethal injection protocol, and the failure to adopt untried and untested alternatives, constitute cruel and unusual punishment,"" Roberts said. His opinion had the support of only two other justices. Three others agreed with the outcome but wrote separate concurring opinions. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter dissented. Ginsburg said Kentucky failed to consider ""readily available safeguards"" to ensure inmates were not subject to pain. She urged the state to revise its procedures, which she suggested might create ""an untoward, readily avoidable risk of inflicting severe and unnecessary pain."" Baze, 52, admits killing Powell County Sheriff Steve Bennett and Deputy Arthur Briscoe in 1992 while the lawmen were trying to serve him with arrest warrants. Bowling was convicted of killing Edward and Tina Earley in Louisville in 1990. Their 2-year-old son was wounded in the attack in the couple's dry cleaning business parking lot. Bowling's lawyers have claimed prosecutorial misconduct and say their client has a low IQ. State officials have said that their lethal-injection procedures are in line with other states and that a doctor is on site and available to provide any pre-execution medical care to the inmate. A Texas inmate was put to death the day the high court accepted the Kentucky cases in late September, but since then, the justices have stepped in and imposed a de facto moratorium nationwide. Only 26 people were executed last year, the lowest total in more than a decade. No executions have taken place this year. The justices spent nearly six months debating the threshold when execution procedures become unconstitutional. Both sides of this politically charged national debate were hoping for clear guidelines from the Supreme Court to help guide capital inmates and the courts. Different states and different judges have applied different standards over whether an inmate can make a challenge to the method of execution. Recent executions in Florida and Ohio were rife with problems, taking much longer than expected when technicians had trouble inserting IVs into the prisoners' veins. The Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that prisoners could make last-ditch legal challenges to the method of execution, using claims that they would suffer a painful death. ""The question before the court was how much risk of unnecessary pain is too much risk of unnecessary pain under the Constitution,"" said Edward Lazarus, an appellate attorney and Supreme Court legal analyst. ""There is evidence to show that this is somewhat of an inhumane way to approach this, but there's going to be a group of justices who really think we shouldn't be in the business of micro-managing the death penalty, [who say] if state legislatures think that this is OK, that's going to be fine with us.""

"(Health.com) -- Boys and young men who receive the human papillomavirus vaccine appear to be at reduced risk of contracting the virus and developing the genital warts associated with the common sexually transmitted disease, according to a large international study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. In an effort to prevent cervical cancer, which can be caused by HPV, public health officials have been encouraging young women to get vaccinated since the Food and Drug Administration approved the first HPV vaccine, Gardasil, in 2006. The vaccine has been approved for boys and men since 2009, but health officials and doctors haven't pushed it with the same urgency. ""Because the story started with cervical cancer, the studies started with females,"" says the lead author of the study, Anna Giuliano, Ph.D., of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Florida. ""The study of HPV in men is a late bloomer."" Health.com: 12 vaccines your child needs . Gardasil is given in a series of three injections. In the study, which included more than 4,000 sexually active males between the ages of 16 and 26, roughly 0.5 percent of the boys and men who received all three shots developed genital warts during the subsequent 2 to 3 years. By contrast, about 2.8 percent of the study participants who received a placebo vaccine developed warts. The vaccine also reduced the risk of contracting an HPV that persists for at least six months, though not as dramatically. HPV can cause certain cancers of the anus and penis in men, although those diseases are far less common than cervical cancer in women. The study was designed and funded by Merck, the maker of Gardasil (also known as Silgard). The National Institutes of Health also provided funding. Health.com: Top 10 myths about safe sex and sexual health . An estimated 20 million Americans are currently infected with HPV. Symptoms are rare, however, so most people have the virus -- and pass it on -- without realizing it. ""Men are such a vital component of the whole prevention cycle when looking at HPV or any sexually transmitted infection,"" says Demetrius Porche, a professor of nursing research and evaluation at the Louisiana State University School of Public Health in New Orleans. Vaccinating men provides a ""double benefit"" in that fewer men with HPV will also mean that fewer women are exposed, adds Porche, who was not involved in the current study but has researched HPV in men. Health.com: What to do if your partner refuses to wear a condom . Earlier this week, for the first time, theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics included the HPV vaccine on its list of recommended vaccines for boys.

"(CNN) -- The Egyptian capital of Cairo has become the focus of efforts to reach a lasting cease-fire in the 10-day conflict in Gaza. The negotiations are shrouded in secrecy. But an Israeli delegation was in Cairo on Thursday amid hopes that new life can be breathed into an Egyptian effort unveiled earlier this week. ""The initiative is ongoing and we are in touch with all relevant parties,"" including the United States, Israel and the Palestinians, an Egyptian official told CNN. ""We hope the Palestinian leaders will accept the initiative for the protection of the Palestinian people,"" he said before going on to urge Hamas ""to stop fire immediately and accept the initiative to avoid further bloodshed."" An Israeli team led by Yoram Cohen -- the head of Israel's domestic security agency Shin Bet -- spent several hours in Cairo, according to Egyptian sources. Israeli officials would not comment on the Israeli envoys' movements. Hamas also has a delegation in Cairo, even though it officially rejected the Egyptian proposal, and says the talks are continuing. Osama Hamdan, a Hamas spokesman based in Beirut, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday: ""No one is talking against having a cease-fire, but we want a fair cease-fire to protect our own people for a long time, to protect them from the Israeli military attacks, from the siege, from the arrests."" The President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, is also involved in the negotiations. Hamas' demands . Officials close to him echo Egyptian optimism that progress is being made. Nabil Shaath, a member of the PLO's Central Committee, told CNN: ""I expect that we will reach an agreement very soon -- a cease-fire that will stop the bloodshed, killing and destruction in Gaza."" ""All other matters will be discussed afterwards: Hamas' demands for opening the Gaza crossings, ending the siege and releasing prisoners."" Among the prisoners Hamas wants freed are some who were among about 1,000 who were released as part of the 2011 deal in which captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was also freed, but have since been re-arrested. ""These are all legitimate demands by Hamas, but the priority is for an immediate ceasefire,"" Shaath told CNN. Another senior Palestinian official, Saeb Erakat, who is traveling with Abbas, said: ""We are trying, along with the UN, to extend the temporary humanitarian ceasefire that took place earlier today [Thursday] on a rolling basis. While there is no plan at this point for a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, but we are trying to extend the current one by another six or 10 hours -- or even several days if possible."" However, the humanitarian pause for five hours Thursday was soon followed by renewed firing in both directions. Egypt's role . The wording of the original Egyptian plan Monday said that ""during the period of the ceasefire....crossings shall be opened and movements of persons and goods shall be facilitated once the security situation becomes stable."" This language and the sequencing are important, because Hamas is demanding the immediate opening of crossings so that food, medical supplies and other essential goods -- as well as the free movement of people -- can begin. Analysts say Hamas wants and needs to show the people of Gaza that it has won concessions after ten days of bombardment in which more than 200 people have been killed and thousands more have been forced to leave their homes. One Israeli official told CNN that Israel's military strikes ""have been very successful,"" bringing closer the prospect of what the official called a period of ""sustainable quiet."" He said there was no such thing as a perfect solution, but that operations in previous years, especially Operation Cast Lead in 2008-09, had been followed by years of relative peace. The official also suggested that Israel -- with Egypt's help -- was ready to consider reopening the Rafah border crossing, but needed guarantees that tunnels between Egypt and Gaza would not be dug anew. The tunnels have been used for smuggling weapons and material for making rockets. And he said that the government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Cairo was much more cooperative than that of its predecessor, Mohamed Morsy, in sealing the tunnels. This would bring Israel closer to its goal of what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as the demilitarization of Gaza. ""We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the [Gaza] Strip -- from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels -- through diplomatic means,"" he said Tuesday. Observers say that for Israel, allowing the Egyptians a diplomatic triumph in brokering a deal would be a small price to pay for close coordination in preventing Hamas from replenishing its armory. Israeli officials say they believe Hamas is isolated diplomatically and in the Arab world, and are encouraged by the absence of protests across the Arab world in support of Hamas. Other efforts . The Egyptian initiative is not the only game in town, with President Abbas due to travel to Turkey on Friday, according to Shaath. Diplomats say Turkey and Qatar have been working on a different formula for a cease-fire, with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu saying he is involved in ""intense diplomacy"" to reach a truce. Hamas' political leader Khaled Meshaal --- who lives in Qatar -- also was in Turkey this week. But Israel is unlikely to give that track the time of day. Its relations with Turkey are poor, and won't be improved after Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan accused Israel of attempting ""systematic genocide"" of the Palestinian people. And both Egypt and Israel are wary of Qatar's ambitions in the region, and its close relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood. Some members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood have fled to Qatar since Morsy was ousted as President last year. Humanitarian cease-fire ends in Gaza .

"(CNN) -- The epiphany occurred at a baptism. With more than 800 people waiting, Pastor Rick Warren took them one by one and immersed them in the church's baptism pool. During this spiritual rite at Saddleback Church, the pastors hold the people briefly underwater, and then pull them out. ""On that particular day, I was baptizing 858 people,"" Warren told his congregation last fall. ""That took me literally four hours."" ""As I'm baptizing 858 people, along around 500, I thought this ... 'We're all fat.' "" Warren turned his realization to himself. ""But I thought, I'm fat,"" he said. ""I'm a terrible model of this. I can't expect our people to get in shape unless I do."" Warren, considered one of the most influential pastors in the country, delivered the inaugural prayer for President Obama in 2009 and wrote the best-selling book ""The Purpose Driven Life."" Now, he was embarking on a new mission: Curbing the obesity epidemic at church. Warren seems like an unlikely man to lead an anti-obesity crusade. A ruddy man with plastic frame glasses, he has admitted to gaining 90 pounds over the last 30 years and failing at various yo-yo diets. He declined an interview for this story. Based in Lake Forest, California, Saddleback is one of the largest churches in the United States and has eight locations throughout Orange County. Warren has a casual style in his ministry, usually preaching in jeans. Since January 2011, Warren has been shrinking. He gave up carbonated drinks, dairy and fast food, he told the church. He works out twice a day, according to his trainer, Tom Wilson. Warren shed 60 pounds on a diet-lifestyle program devised at Saddleback Church called the Daniel Plan. The program's name comes from the biblical story about Daniel. In the story, Daniel and his friends, who are Israelites living in Babylon, refuse to consume royal food and wine. By eating vegetables and water, ""they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food,"" according to Daniel 1:15 in the Bible's New International Version. The Daniel Program, which started at Saddleback Church last January, advises how to eat healthier foods, encourages workout routines and urges participants to join small groups. The program was free. Warren recruited three doctors to develop the plan: Daniel Amen, a psychiatrist; Mark Hyman, a family doctor; and Mehmet Oz, a TV host and cardiac surgeon. ""The secret sauce of Saddleback is we do this as a community,"" said Amen, one of the medical contributors. ""It's very different than most health plans where you do it with yourself or your wife. You get to do this with a whole community."" Studies indicate that people who try to lose weight or adopt healthier habits in groups are more likely to be successful than individuals working independently. The small groups have health and spiritual curricula, and provide a support network. Saddleback was the ideal place, because small groups already existed at the church and Warren had ""instantaneous capacity to make this happen,"" said Hyman, another contributor to the Daniel Plan. ""The church was the perfect incubator,"" he said. ""This was a way of leapfrogging and getting a social experiment done."" Chiquita Seals, a member of Saddleback, said that having a small group was instrumental to her 125-pound weight loss. Her group met twice a month to discuss their health, and they also hiked together. Each small group has a health champion, whom Seals credits with ""helping me emotionally, physically."" ""The health champion guides the group -- 'This is what we're cooking, this is what we're doing' -- and cheers you on and helps you out. It's not just the food you're eating, it's also mental gain,"" she said. The church held a race, cooking demonstrations and various workout classes led by Tae Bo founder Billy Blanks. It overhauled the menus and vending machine products sold at church and placed symbols to indicate which choices were healthy. Doughnuts often given to the congregation were replaced with trail mix. The church developed a website with recipes, advice on physical activity and health information. ""It's not a diet, not a healthy quick scheme, it's designed to be a way to create health,"" Hyman said. At the end of the first year, about 15,000 people had registered for the program and 250,000 pounds were lost, according to Saddleback Church. The Daniel Plan is a program the founders intended to spread to different faith communities across the globe, Hyman said. But many at Saddleback wondered why the church would get involved in health and weight loss. ""I wondered whether this was something church should be doing,"" said Julie McGough, a member of Saddleback Church for 18 years. McGough and her husband decided to try the plan, because they had gained weight during his illness with multiple sclerosis. Between his doctor's visits, hospital appointments and busy schedule, the family came to rely on fast food as their staple. The couple and their two kids, ages 10 and 16, cleaned out their pantry, gave up the In-N-Out burgers and started cooking as a family activity. They started eating chicken, broccoli, squash and a variety of vegetables, and in smaller portions. They bought a trampoline for the kids and also started hiking. One year later, McGough has lost 28 pounds. Her husband has lost 55 pounds and stopped taking as many medications. ""This is what we should be doing,"" McGough said about the church's involvement in the health plan. ""I am far more able to serve God because I'm healthy."" Warren said in several speeches to the congregation that he never paid much attention to the perils of obesity such as diabetes and heart disease. But when he heard that obesity could affect a person's brain power, it snapped him into action. Growing evidence indicates that obesity is associated with impaired cognitive function, such as attention and memory problems. Warren often repeats the same phrases when discussing the Daniel Plan. ""The Father made your body, Jesus paid for your body, the Spirit lives in your body. You better take care of it.""","Pastor Rick Warren started a health plan addressing diet and fitness at church .

"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old Arizona boy who admitted to shooting and killing his father and another man in 2008 was sentenced Thursday to ""in-patient treatment"" that could go on for several years, according to the prosecutor. The boy pleaded guilty in February to one count of negligent homicide in exchange for a plea deal that dropped the two counts of murder he was charged with initially. The boy was accused of killing his father, Vincent Romero, 29, and Tim Romans, 39, who rented a room in Romero's home in St. Johns, Arizona. Both men were found dead at the home November 5, 2008, and police said the next day that the boy confessed to shooting them with a .22-caliber weapon. At the time, the boy was 8. ""Under the plea agreement, he can be there (in treatment) up until he is 18,"" Apache County, Arizona, Attorney Michael Whiting said after the sentencing. ""We hope that the treatment won't take that long. Obviously, it's not going to be successful if he is there when he is 18, and they are still treating him."" Whiting did not specifically describe what type of treatment the boy will undergo, beyond saying a psychiatrist will be involved and that the youth will be kept at his treatment facility with no ability to leave. The judge in the case ordered follow-up evaluations of the boy every two and a half years to update court officials on his progress. Defense attorney Ron Wood said the boy was upset and crying in court during the sentencing and, ""He was frightened."" The boy apologized and ""accepted responsibility for what he did,"" Wood said. During a news conference after the sentencing, Wood was asked how confident he is the treatment will work for his client. ""I don't know, ask me in three years. Ask me when he's been through the process of having his brain picked ... then maybe we will find out,"" Wood said. Asked the same question, Whiting replied, ""50-50 ... I would bet it's going to be a tough road."" Earlier, Whiting said, ""There is not a question of who committed this crime. The question becomes, how does society and the court system deal with this crime.""","Boy admitted to shooting and killing his father, another man in 2008 when he was 8 .

"(CNN) -- The detention and interrogation facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which I have visited, has served and continues to serve an important role in the war against terrorists since it opened 10 years ago. It houses high-value terrorist detainees, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of September 11. The military commissions' courthouse, called the Expeditionary Legal Compound, is a world-class, state-of-the-art facility specifically designed to accommodate the needs of both defense and prosecutors dealing with classified information. The detainees there are represented by civilian and military counsel, and the Supreme Court has ruled that they enjoy the constitutional right of habeas corpus. The conditions of detention there are safe, secure and humane and comply with national and international standards, including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. It is important to remember that the United States of America is engaged in armed conflict and has been since September 11, 2001. The September 18, 2001, Authorization for Use of Military Force, relied upon by both the Bush and Obama administrations, gives our military the legal authority to engage the enemy under appropriate circumstances. Under the law of armed conflict, also called the law of war, engaging the enemy includes killing or capturing the enemy. This age-old principle -- detention of the enemy during wartime for the duration of hostilities -- is just as applicable to al Qaeda as it was to Nazi POWs in World War II or other enemies in previous wars. This principle has been upheld by our courts, including the United States Supreme Court. Shortly after September 11, it became evident that this war would be different from all previous wars in the sense that we would need to rely more on tactical and strategic intelligence to thwart and defeat the enemy than traditional military might. To defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates, we needed to know what they knew; one of the obvious ways to learn their intentions was through lawful interrogation at a safe detention facility. Guantanamo, used as a detention facility since the Clinton administration, was just such a place. There have been 779 detainees at Guantanamo. Today, there are only 171. But over the past decade, we have not only kept dangerous terrorists at Guantanamo and thus away from the battlefield, we have learned a great deal from them during long-term, lawful interrogations. Without a safe, secure detention and interrogation facility, we would not have gained the tactical and strategic intelligence needed to degrade and ultimately defeat the enemy. It has been said that the mere existence of Guantanamo is a recruiting tool for the enemy. However, recall that there was no Guantanamo detention facility when al Qaeda bombed the World Trade Center in the 1990s or blew up the U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 or attacked the USS Cole in 2000. And I suspect that if the Bush administration had brought the Guantanamo detainees not to Cuba but to a detention facility in the United States, that facility would have been the object of their scorn and derision. All things considered, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay has played an invaluable role in the war against terrorists by keeping them off the battlefield and allowing for lawful interrogations. Neither the Bush nor Obama administrations has offered a reasonable and feasible alternative to Guantanamo. Unless and until a safe, reasonable alternative facility is proposed, the United States should continue to use Guantanamo as a detention, interrogation and military commissions' facility.

"(CNN) -- Despite all the political tension in Crimea, it's nice to know things are still safe enough at the zoo for a zebra to get it on with a donkey. Because, really, in some weird, small way, it's a symbol of hope. Like an olive branch. Except, in this case, it's a zebra ... getting it on with a donkey. But as odd as it may sound, things (ahem) worked out, and now we have an adorable new reminder of what can happen when we put aside our differences for the shared goal of peace and love. And Doing It. That living, breathing reminder is a beautiful baby ""zonkey"" named Telegraph, who recently came into the world at the Taigan Zoo park near Crimea's main city, Simferopol. Of course, a zonkey is just what it sounds like. Half zebra. Half donkey. Possibly even part lion depending on what kind of shenanigans were going on inside the stall. (And if you accept my rather misguided understanding of how conception works.) But one thing that's perfectly clear is that this little guy is ridiculously cute. And everyone is talking about him. So, it sort of makes sense that Telegraph was named for a local newspaper, honoring the publication's fifth anniversary. Though, when you think about it, that may or may not be a compliment to the publication. ""Congrats. We named an ass after you."" Either way, Telegraph is just lucky to be alive. Although cross-breeding of equines is not unheard of, it is rather rare and unconventional. And proper zoos aren't overly keen on the idea. Photos: Zonkeys and ligers and pizzles . But this facility says that toying with nature was never a part of the plan. You see, Telegraph's mother -- the zebra -- was uncomfortable in her enclosure and had been without a mate for quite a while. Presumably, she spent most of her time being bitter with the other single girls in book club. Eventually, the zoo moved the lonely zebra into a different part of the complex where she could be surrounded by other hoofed animals. This included her dream donkey. Mind you, it's also possible that she was simply desperate and the donkey was drunk. ""I like your stripes."" ""What?"" ""I SAID I LIKE YOUR STRIPES!"" No matter how it all went down, we're all thankful. Because now we have this silly looking thing with a brown upper body and zebra legs. And visitors to the zoo are absolutely loving him. Of course, to be fair, all baby animals tend to be a big draw. Especially when you look like you've been pieced together with spare parts. Think about it. An adorable baby polar bear with a tortoise shell would pretty much stop the world from spinning. Darwin would be cheering from his grave. And scientists might go crazy trying to figure out just how the hell that actually happened. Steve would finally own up to it. ""I'm sorry! I was bored. I fed them bourbon."" But, no matter the species, whenever you get a cute baby cross-breed, you sort of have to enjoy it while you can. Generally speaking, hybrid animals don't reproduce. They tend to be infertile. (It's a science thing. I don't quite get it. Mr. Ware tried to teach me in high school, but I was far more interested in depriving others of their education.) That said, being infertile might not be such a bad thing if, say, you're a rather confident liger and you do well at the clubs. Child support ain't cheap. Liger on! Anyway, that's the story of a cute little zonkey who is currently enjoying his 15 minutes of worldwide Internet fame. Telegraph, we like your stripes. ""What?"" WE LIKE YOUR STRIPES!

"Washington (CNN) -- When Tip O'Neill retired in 1987, he was asked how the quality of people elected to Congress had changed in his 30-plus years of service. The former Speaker of the House answered: ""The quality is clearly better, much better."" But, he added, ""The results are definitely worse."" He meant: as compared to the Congresses of the 1950s, the Congresses of the 1980s contained fewer drunks and fewer crooks. Members were better educated and harder working. Yet the Congresses of the 1950s managed to balance the budget, confirm presidential nominees in reasonable time and enact programs, like the one that created the interstate highway system. The Congresses of the 1980s could do none of those things. And of course the contemporary record is even worse. This past summer, Congress very nearly pushed the United States into an unnecessary default. Another government shutdown looms. The budgeting of the United States is in chaos. The Federal Reserve has been left for months with two vacancies on its seven-member board because of secret holds by individual senators. Politics is a contest, limited by certain unwritten rules. And over the past two decades, old rules have broken down. Under the old rules, there were certain things that political parties did not do -- even though theoretically they could. If one party controlled the Senate and another party controlled the presidency, the Senate party did not reject all the president's nominees. The party that controlled the House did not refuse to schedule votes on the president's budgets. Individual senators did not use secret holds to sway national policy. The filibuster was reserved for rare circumstances -- not as a routine 60-vote requirement on every Senate vote. It's incredible to look back now on how the Reagan tax cut passed the Democratic House in 1981. The Democratic House leaderships could have refused to schedule votes on Reagan's tax plans. Instead, they not only allowed the tax plan to proceed -- but they allowed 48 of 243 Democrats to break ranks on the key procedural vote without negative consequences to their careers in the Democratic party. (Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas, for example, who voted for the tax cuts would rise to become Secretary of Agriculture under President Clinton.) Hard to imagine Speaker John Boehner allowing his Republicans to get away with similar behavior on a measure proposed by President Obama. What's happening before our eyes is that the US congressional system is adopting the attitudes of a Westminster-style parliamentary system. In a parliamentary system, ""the duty of an opposition is to oppose"" (in the famous words of Benjamin Disraeli). The opposition uses every trick and technique to thwart and defeat the government; the government uses all the powers of a parliamentary majority to overwhelm the opposition. (To quote Disraeli again: ""a majority is always better than the best repartee."") Then, at regular intervals, the two sides switch roles. In the American system, there is no ""government"" and no ""opposition."" Who would lead such a ""government""? President Obama? Or the man in command of the majority in the lower House -- Prime Minister John Boehner? In a system built around an administration and a bicameral Congress, everybody is part of the government -- and the government only functions if there exists a certain baseline spirit of cooperation between the mutually indispensable parts. That spirit of cooperation has tended to vanish in recent years. Back in 1986, Democratic leaders quashed those in their party who wished to try impeach Ronald Reagan over Iran-Contra. But as the Cold War ended, the party struggle intensified. The shock of the economic crisis since 2008 has made things worse still: desperate times lead to desperate politics. The old rules were based upon certain conditions that have long since vanished. Back then, Congress was filled with legislators who shared the common bond of military service: in 1981, 73 of the senators were veterans as compared to only 25 today; a similar trend characterizes the House. The imperatives of the Cold War inspired a spirit of deference to the president. The long association of the filibuster with opposition to civil rights tended to discredit its use. The national media were dominated by a few big institutions that professed (even if they did not always deliver) nonpartisanship. Americans intermingled more with people of different points of view. Bill Bishop points out in his important book, ""The Big Sort,"" in the very close presidential election of 1976, only 26% of Americans lived in a county that went for Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter by a margin of 20 points or more. In the also close presidential election of 2004, almost 50% of Americans lived in a county that voted by more than 20 points for either George W. Bush or John Kerry. Perhaps above all: the long prosperity of the postwar years lubricated the system with enough resources that just about everybody could get some of what they wanted: more spending, moderate taxes, reasonable borrowing, strong national defense. Now instead we have a country that is spatially polarized, that gets its information from highly partisan media, and that confronts the worst recession and the darkest financial outlook since the 1930s. The results of these changes are breaking the American political system -- destroying public confidence in the U.S. government -- and paralyzing the U.S. economic policy. It will take more than a change in attitudes to address these concerns. It will take fundamental institutional reform. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: In past 30 years, rules of bipartisan cooperation have dissolved .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Hollywood home of the Academy Awards show has a new name to replace the one it lost when Eastman Kodak Co. filed for bankruptcy in January. The former Kodak Theatre is now the Dolby Theatre, thanks to a 20-year naming rights contract with Dolby Laboratories, a company known for its movie sound systems. Along with getting its name mentioned frequently in the Oscars broadcasts and coverage leading up to the show, Dolby will use the theater as a ""world class showcase for Dolby innovation,"" said Ramzi Haidamus, Dolby's sales and marketing executive vice president. The sponsorship deal includes a commitment by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to keep the annual Oscars ceremony in the 3,400-seat theater for another 20 years; it has been there since 2002. ""The Academy's Board of Governors believes that the home for our awards is in Hollywood,"" Academy President Tom Sherak said. ""It is where the Academy and the motion picture industry are rooted."" There had been speculation that the Oscars could move to the newer Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. Dolby would not reveal how much it was paying for the naming rights, but Kodak reportedly paid $4 million a year in the deal, initiated when the theater opened in 2001. Dolby's contract is ""very directly tied to the Oscars being held in this theatre,"" meaning the company could get out of the deal if the Academy moved its awards show before 2033, Haidamus said. The company is ""working feverishly"" to produce Dolby Theatre marquee signage, which should be up within weeks, he said. The theater is in a retail complex at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, one of the world's most-visited tourist spots.","A new naming rights deal creates the Dolby Theatre .

"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- ""It was killing people, and I wanted to do something about it."" Bambi Gaddist's nonprofit has provided free HIV tests to more than 8,600 people since 2000. That realization about the AIDS crisis propelled Bambi Gaddist into activism in South Carolina more than 20 years ago, and she's been relentless in her fight to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS there ever since. One of the most effective tools in her arsenal? A large white RV. With ""GET TESTED"" written in bold letters on its side, the camper van is the mobile unit of the South Carolina HIV/AIDS Council, a nonprofit that Gaddist helped start and has headed since 1995. The only unit of its kind in South Carolina, the van brings confidential HIV testing and information to communities across the state. Since 2000, Gaddist's organization has provided HIV tests to more than 8,600 people, free of charge. Gaddist says the face of AIDS has changed since the mid-1980s, when she helped run one of the first grass-roots AIDS awareness campaigns in Columbia, South Carolina, while pursuing her doctorate in public health. ""In the '80s, HIV was seen as a gay, white male disease,"" Gaddist said. ""Here in South Carolina, it became an African-American disease."" In 2006, African-Americans accounted for 76 percent of the new AIDS cases diagnosed in South Carolina, and the state ranked ninth in the nation for those living with the disease, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. iReport.com: Share stories of being black in America . Statistics like these are what drives Gaddist and her staff. The mobile unit hits the road at least two to three times a week, and Gaddist says it goes just about anywhere -- gay and straight nightclubs, housing projects, health fairs or churches. ""We refuse to be quiet. That's what's going to save the lives of our children: talking about it and not hiding it,"" Gaddist said. At outreach events, staffers distribute free condoms and information while trying to recruit people to be tested. Eight to 15 people usually take the 10-minute test at every event. Someday, Gaddist hopes, HIV tests will be as common as breast cancer exams or skin cancer screenings.  Watch Gaddist and her team in action outside a nightclub » . ""We're trying to normalize this,"" Gaddist said. ""[We want] anyone, regardless of who they are, to say, 'I need to know my status.' "" Gaddist believes that the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS has contributed to people's ignorance about the virus and to its alarming spread throughout the state. ""After 27 years of AIDS, we are still combating a mentality of fear and shame,"" she said. In response, Gaddist has recruited powerful allies to her cause: South Carolina's churches. Since 2006, Gaddist's group has run a program that educates local pastors about the disease and teaches them how to do outreach in their communities. Gaddist has gotten 30 churches on board. She believes that this isn't just spreading much-needed awareness; it's helping reshape public attitudes.  Watch Gaddist describe how churches have gotten involved with her cause » . ""People still believe that you get [HIV/AIDS] from touching someone, from hugging someone,"" Gaddist said. ""The first arm of defense against this disease is to educate them."" In the past, Gaddist says, some churches helped perpetuate the stigma about the disease. ""[But] now more than ever before, the church holds a solution to the HIV/AIDS epidemic,"" she said. Gaddist has helped her organization grow from a two-person operation to a 23-member staff. In addition to testing and counseling, the South Carolina HIV/AIDS Council provides case management for people living with HIV and runs several programs targeting at-risk populations. Still, for all she's done, Gaddist can't imagine a time when she'll ever stop doing this work.  Watch Gaddist explain how the mobile outreach unit works with the community » . ""I joke about being a 70-year-old woman giving out condoms,"" she said. Knowing how many people are at risk is what keeps Gaddist motivated.

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Indian couples tied the knot Sunday, one of the luckiest days in the Hindu calendar. ""There are 50,000 weddings happening today"" in Mumbai alone, said wedding planner Jarret D'Abreo of Marry Me. Marry Me is working only one, but is consulting on seven others, Marry Me's Candice Pereira told CNN. ""It is impossible to find wedding vendors or venues at short notice for a highly auspicious date. The wedding that we are working on has been booked eight months in advance,"" explained Pereira, the company's creative head and co-founder. ""We have had a lot of couples seek our help to secure venues and other vendors at the last moment. ""Also, most other vendors that we work with have in excess of five functions today due to it being a highly auspicious date,"" she said. There are only a few lucky dates per year in the Hindu calendar. Sunday's is called Akshaya Tritiya. ""All the stars are aligned during this day. Whatever offerings and work you do on this day will go right. It's one day of the year which will bring immense good luck,"" Indian astrologer R.K. Sharma said. On Akshaya, ""none of the bad karma or defects in your birth chart matter. It's a very good day to make a new start to life,"" he said. The exact date of the festival is based on the alignment of the moon, the stars and the planets. It marks the date ""the Hindu god Lord Parasurama (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) came to earth in the form of a human being,"" the astrologer said, invoking a Hindu concept that has been widely appropriated in the Internet age -- the avatar. In Hinduism, the word refers to the earthly incarnation of a god. ""Whatever is celebrated during this day -- be it purchasing a car or a house or gold or even getting married -- brings good luck and that effect is multiplied. It's the most auspicious day of the year,"" Sharma told CNN by phone. The festival is driving up sales in India's jewelry shops, one merchant said. Vummidi Bagaru Jewellers had about twice as much daily trade as usual, and could reach three times as much, partner Jiphendra Vummidi told CNN by phone from Chennai. People made plans in advance to make their purchases on Akshaya, he said. ""They're purchases they wanted to get for a wedding or an occasion -- jewelry predominantly, but bullion coins are also being bought,"" he said. ""It's a day when you could do anything good and it's supposed to help you do that good through the year,"" he said of Akshaya. ""It used to be that people used to feed people on that day. Now with the economic boom, people have more money and they prefer to buy gold as security in a crisis,"" he said. ""They feel that if they buy gold today, they will have the capacity to buy gold this year."" Gold is hovering around record prices. Vummidi said that was part of a supply-and-demand effect on sales and prices around Akshaya. ""They are not buying as much as I think they would have bought if the price was stable,"" he said. ""Most people in the (gold) trade know about this day and feel that prices could be up for this day and then they could fall."" Big stores ran full-page advertisements in newspapers, inviting customers to go on a buying spree on the lucky date. One newspaper ad even offered Hindu hymns as ring tones on mobile phones. But this is no free service. At the bottom of the ad, cell-phone companies listed prices for ordering holy downloads. CNN producer Harmeet Shah Singh in New Delhi said he got unsolicited text messages on his phone from businesses and advertisers ahead of the festival. One sample read: ""This Akshaya Tritya bring home prosperity! Book your apt (apartment)..."". The message included a chance to win a gold coin on a booking of a home worth at least 1.6 million rupees ($34,000). There are about a billion Hindus in the world, experts estimate, making it the third largest religion after Christianity and Islam. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Akshaya Tritiya is one of only a few lucky dates per year in the Hindu calendar .

"Key Largo, Florida (CNN) -- It was more than 40 years ago, but Ken Nedimyer still remembers the first time he went diving in the Florida Keys. ""It was just the most magical place I'd ever been to,"" said Nedimyer, 56. ""The coral reefs were so pretty. So many fish and so many neat things to see."" Nedimyer became a commercial fisherman and tropical fish collector, working in the ocean nearly every day of the year. But by the mid-1980s, he noticed a troubling trend. Two of the region's most important corals, staghorn and elkhorn, were in drastic decline. The corals -- tiny, stationary marine animals that make up the reefs -- were dying because of many reasons, including climate change, pollution and overfishing, experts said. Today, they're on the endangered species list. ""The coral reefs of the Florida Keys are the most threatened and the heaviest-used coral reefs in the world,"" said Billy Causey, southeast regional director of the National Marine Sanctuaries, an entity of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Reefs are often referred to as the rainforests of the sea. They attract more marine life than anywhere else in the ocean because of the natural shelter they provide. But they're declining worldwide, not just in Florida, and some scientists fear that they could all be gone by 2050. ""Coral reefs provide protection for our coastal areas, habitat for fish and recreational opportunities for millions and millions of people,"" Nedimyer said. ""It's very important to protect that whole ecosystem."" Reefs also have great economic value. Many people around the world depend on fisheries and the ocean for their livelihood. In the Florida Keys alone, more than 50 percent of the local economy is connected to a healthy marine environment. ""If coral reefs died completely, entire economies would be disrupted,"" Nedimyer said. As Nedimyer saw reefs die over the years, he became very concerned. ""It became a consuming passion (for me) to try to find ways to protect and restore coral reefs,"" he said. That passion led to Nedimyer starting the Coral Restoration Foundation, which has grown more than 25,000 staghorn and elkhorn corals in underwater nurseries. He and his staff of volunteers work three days a week maintaining the nurseries just off Key Largo. The nurseries cover more than an acre of the ocean floor. ""Ken's coral nursery is the largest in the wider Caribbean,"" Causey said. ""It's probably 10 times larger than any others that I know of."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . Nedimyer's methods for growing corals have evolved over the years, but they're all simple, easily duplicated and can be taught to anyone who can dive, he said. After the corals spend about a year growing in the nursery, they are transplanted to a reef in the wild. The goal is to get them to reproduce on their own and repopulate an area where they no longer exist. ""We've been able to recreate one of the biggest thickets in the Florida Keys of staghorn coral, and that's something we can duplicate throughout the Keys and throughout the Caribbean,"" Nedimyer said. Through education and awareness, Nedimyer has built a community committed to bringing coral reefs back to the Keys. His organization often collaborates with other groups, including the NOAA and the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit conservation group. Nedimyer also spends a lot of time showing high school students his methods and working with them at his nurseries. ""This isn't just about me,"" Nedimyer emphasized. ""It's about engaging a lot of people and training people, and I think it has a lot of hope."" The impact is already noticeable in areas where corals have been transplanted. Fish and other marine life are starting to come back, and Nedimyer is hopeful that in time, the Keys' ecosystem will recover. ""Most people think coral takes forever to grow, but some of these corals grow really fast,"" he said. ""They grow fast enough that we could make a big difference in a lifetime or less."" Nedimyer's most ambitious project is just ahead. Within the next five years, the Coral Restoration Foundation plans to grow and transplant 50,000 corals in the Keys, which he says is the largest effort of its kind in Florida and the Caribbean. ""Before, I felt helpless watching corals die,"" Nedimyer said. ""Now I think there's a way for everybody to get involved. There's hope."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- A Texas constable and two others were shot dead Monday in about a half an hour of gunfire near Texas A&M University, police said. Scott McCollum, assistant chief with the College Station police department, told reporters Monday afternoon that the three people killed were a Brazos County constable, the man authorities say exchanged gunfire with law enforcement officers and a male civilian. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund noted that the slain constable, Brian Bachmann, is the sixth law enforcement official killed so far this year in Texas. According to his Facebook campaign page, Bachmann was a 41-year-old from College Station who had been a Brazos County sheriff's deputy since 1993. The county's website indicated that his four-year term as constable -- a position that involves, among other duties, serving court documents such as eviction notices and subpoenas to citizens -- was set to expire on December 31, 2014. ""He was a pillar in this community, and it's sad and tragic that we've lost him today,"" McCollum said. The city of College Station on Monday night identified the suspect at the center of the standoff as 35-year-old Thomas Caffall. On a Facebook page purported to be by Caffall, he indicates his hometown is nearby Bryan, Texas, but that he was living in College Station -- though he also described himself as ""a cross between Forrest Gump and Jack Kerouac ... I'm on the road permanently."" Three of the seven profile pictures on the Facebook page are of rifles, three feature dogs and one shows a man in an image much like one distributed Monday night by the city of College Station. His list of ""inspirational people"" includes famed snipers Vasily Zaytsev and Carlos Hathcock, as well as noted firearms designers Eugene Stoner, Mikhail Kalashnikov, John Garand, Samuel Colt and John Browning. The writer indicates he is divorced and has a mother, sister and brother. The page also includes a quote saying, ""We are all capable of redemption, if we are willing to change,"" plus another he attributes to George Orwell stating, ""People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf."" As to the third victim, described as a ""civilian bystander,"" he was identified as 43-year-old Chris Northcliff of College Station. Four others suffered injuries in the roughly 30-minute ordeal after law enforcement officers arrived at a residence a few blocks from the Texas A&M campus. They included College Station police Officer Justin Oehlke, who was shot in the calf, and two other officers -- one of whom refused transport to an area hospital -- who suffered ""non-life-threatening injuries,"" McCollum said. A 55-year-old female civilian who was shot was undergoing surgery Monday afternoon at a hospital, according to the assistant police chief. He explained that police got a call shortly after 12:10 p.m. from a citizen indicating shots had been fired in the residential area just south of the university campus. He added that the constable had gone to the residence to deliver an eviction notice. Texas A&M issued a Code Maroon -- the university's emergency notification system -- at 12:29 p.m., telling people to avoid the area because of a report of an ""active shooter."" By then, two law enforcement officers who were nearby had responded and found the constable down in the front yard of a home. They ""received fire from the suspect inside, ... took cover and defended themselves,"" McCollum said, noting other officers were then called to the scene. ""They ended up shooting the gunman,"" said the assistant police chief. At 12:44 p.m., Texas A&M posted another Code Maroon update on its website indicating the suspect was by then ""in custody."" Caffall's mother Linda Weaver issued a statement through family attorney W. Tyler Moore indicating her son, whom she called Tres, was ""ill"" and saying the family was ""shocked and devastated by the tragedy."" ""Our thoughts and prayers go to the families of the deceased and the wounded victims,"" Weaver said. ""We mourn them and the loss of Tres. He had been ill. It breaks our hearts his illness led to this."" College Station Mayor Nancy Berry also put out a statement Monday night in which she lauded Bachmann, her city's police department and others ""who stood with us throughout the day."" ""What unfolded today in College Station is beyond tragic,"" Berry said. ""There are many victims, including families of Mr. Caffall and Mr. Northcliff, who will continue to suffer physical and emotional pain for a very long time, and we shouldn't forget them.""
